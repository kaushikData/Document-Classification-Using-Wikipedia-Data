{"id": "14433440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14433440", "title": "Balance of power (parliament)", "text": "Balance of power (parliament)\n\nIn parliamentary politics, the term balance of power may describe a parliamentary situation in which a member or a number of members of chamber are in a position by their uncommitted vote to enable a party to attain and remain in minority government, and the term may also be applied to the members who hold that position. The members holding the balance of power may guarantee their support for a government by either joining it in a coalition government or by an assurance that they will vote against any motion of no confidence in the government or abstain in such a vote. In return for such a commitment, such persons may demand legislative or policy commitments from the party they are to support. A person or party may also hold a balance of power in a chamber without any commitment to government, in which case both the government and opposition groupings may on occasion need to negotiate that person's legislative support.\n\nIn the 1940 federal election of the 74 seats in the House of Representatives, the United Australia/Country Coalition won 36 seats, the Labor Party won 32, the Non-Communist Labor Party won 4, and there were two independents, leaving the United Australia government of Robert Menzies without a majority in the lower house. The Coalition continued in government with the support of the two independents. The following year, the Non-Communist Labor Party, a breakaway Labor faction associated with former New South Wales premier Jack Lang, was readmitted to the Labor Party, and after the removal of Menzies by his own party, the independents in Parliament switched their support to Labor, allowing Opposition Leader John Curtin to form a minority government until his landslide reelection in 1943.\n\nAfter the 2010 federal election of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives, both the Labor Party and the Liberal/National Coalition held 72 seats, and there was one Greens, one MP was a member of the National Party of Western Australia (which is not part of the Liberal/National Coalition), and four independents. After several weeks of negotiations, Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard eventually retained power after signing separate confidence and supply agreements with the Greens and three of the independents. The agreements required the non-government party to support the government in a no-confidence motion and on supply bills, in return for the passage of some legislation, such as setting up an emissions trading scheme in the case of the Greens (see Gillard Government§Minority government). The Labor minority government was able to govern for the full term of the house.\n\nThe Senate, which serves as the nation's upper house and as a house of review, was established on the basis of ensuring that the smaller Colonies joining the Commonwealth were given equal representation, as required under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. Between 1901 and 1918, Senators were elected on a first past the post system, changing to each state voting as one electorate on a preferential system from 1918 until 1948. During this period, the majority party in the lower house also generally had a commanding majority in the Senate. Since 1949, Senators are elected on the basis of achieving a transferable quota in each State or Territory. In more recent years, this method of election has generally resulted in a multi-party mix. In the early years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, Senators were more inclined to vote along State lines, with some exceptions.\n\nThe Senate has the power to reject, amend or defer bills passed by the lower house, thus obliging the government of the day to negotiate with minor parties in the Senate (or the opposition) in order to pass its legislation. The Australian Senate cannot directly bring down a government, though it can pass an indicative motion of no confidence and has the power to defer or block supply bills, as notoriously occurred in the constitutional crisis of 1975 which was precipitated, in part, by the deferment of supply through a manipulated balance of power.\n\nCompared to other Westminster Systems, minority governments are far more common in Canada. Much of this is credited to the relatively uneven electoral demographics of the country, with most national parties relying on regional bases. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, minority Parliaments were quite common in Canada, and produced many subsequent political compromises through political cooperation, mostly between the Liberal Party of Canada and the New Democratic Party of Canada, which included the Canada Pension Plan and Universal Healthcare during the tenure of Lester B. Pearson. After the 1980 election, minority governments became less common in Canada for the next several decades, but the 2004 general election returned Canada to minority government, and the subsequent general elections of 2005-06 and 2008 would also result in minority governments, but the 2011 general election gave Stephen Harper's Conservatives a clear majority in the House of Commons for the first time since the merging of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance.\n\nDespite the frequency of minority governments, however, coalitions are rare to nonexistent in Canadian democracy, especially in federal politics, and especially in the modern era. A notable exception was the political crisis that arose during the 2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute, in which the three opposition parties attempted to form a coalition government to oust the Conservative Party of Canada, which held a minority mandate in the House of Commons. This coalition failed, however, due to Governor-General Michaëlle Jean's resulting prorogation of Parliament until January 2009.\n\nAt the provincial level, by contrast, coalitions have governed in the provincial Parliaments of Manitoba, Ontario and British Columbia.\n\nThe normal UK response to a \"hung\" or \"balanced\" parliament is the formation of a minority government. Coalitions or even formal agreements by one party to support the government of another party are rare.\n\n1847-1852 Conservative 325, Whig and Radical 292, Irish Repeal 36, Irish Confederate 2, Chartist 1. Total seats 656.\n\nThe United Kingdom general election, 1847 produced a House of Commons in which no group had a clear majority. Candidates calling themselves Conservatives won the largest number of seats. However, the split among the Conservatives between the majority of Protectionists, led by Lord Stanley, and the minority of free traders, known also as the Peelites, led by former prime minister Sir Robert Peel, left the Whigs, led by prime minister Lord John Russell, in a position to continue in government.\n\nThe Irish Repeal group won more seats than in the previous general election, while the Chartists' Feargus O'Connor gained the only seat the party would ever hold.\n\n1885-1886 Liberal 319, Conservative 249, Irish Parliamentary Party 86, Others 16. Total seats 670.\n\nAs a result of the United Kingdom general election, 1885 there was no single party with a majority in the House of Commons. The Irish Nationalists, led by Charles Stewart Parnell had the balance of power.\n\nThe Conservative minority government (led by the Marquess of Salisbury), which had come to office earlier in the year after the Parnellites and dissident Liberals had defeated the Liberal government of W.E. Gladstone, improved its position in the election but not sufficiently to obtain a majority. During the general election Parnell had called on Irish voters in Britain to vote Tory (i.e. Conservative).\n\nHowever, as Gladstone was willing to propose a measure of Home Rule for Ireland which Salisbury opposed, Parnell decided to bring down the Conservative ministry when the new parliament met. A Liberal minority government came into office in January 1886.\n\n1892-1895 Conservative and Liberal Unionist 313, Liberal 272, Irish Nationalists 81, Others 4. Total seats 670.\n\nThe situation was similar to that in 1885-86. Following the United Kingdom general election, 1892, although the Irish Nationalists were split between pro and anti-Parnellite factions, they all still preferred the pro-Home-Rule Liberals to the anti-Home-Rule Unionists of Salisbury. The Conservative government was defeated early in the new parliament and Gladstone formed a new Liberal minority government.\n\n1910-1915 United Kingdom general election, January 1910 Liberal 274, Conservative and Liberal Unionist 272, Irish Nationalists 82, Labour 40, Other 2. Total seats 670.\n\nUnited Kingdom general election, December 1910 Liberal 272, Conservative and Liberal Unionist 271, Irish Nationalists 84, Labour 42, Other 1. Total seats 670.\n\nThe Liberal government of H.H. Asquith continued in office as a stable minority administration. Despite strains, both the Irish and Labour members preferred a Liberal government to a Conservative one. This continued to be the case until Asquith formed a Liberal-Conservative-Labour coalition to prosecute the First World War.\n\n1923-1924 United Kingdom general election, 1923 Conservative 258, Labour 191, Liberal 158, Others 8. Total seats 615.\n\nThe 1923 general election led to the defeat of the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin. The Labour Party of Ramsay MacDonald formed a minority government in January 1924. Although the party with the balance of power (Asquith's Liberals) appeared to be in a very strong position, the Labour leaders made a deliberate decision not to reach any agreement with the Liberals. As the Liberal Party did not want to join forces with the Conservatives and could not afford a quick general election, they were left in the awkward position of having to vote with the government on measures they had not been consulted about.\n\nThe Labour government eventually fell when, in a debate about alleged political interference in a decision whether to prosecute a Communist newspaper editor, the Conservative Party abandoned its own motion and voted for a Liberal one which thus passed and caused the resignation of the Labour government.\n\n1929-1931 United Kingdom general election, 1929 Labour 287, Conservative 260, Liberal 59, Others 9. Total seats 615.\n\nThe situation was similar to 1923-1924. However the Labour Party was the largest party in the House of Commons, so the Liberals (now led by David Lloyd George) could abstain without bringing down the new Labour minority government.\n\nAs the world economic situation worsened, MacDonald had some discussions with Lloyd George. These led to a government bill to introduce the Australian style alternative vote electoral system. This measure was being obstructed by the Conservative Party and dissident Labour politicians and had not become law before the Labour government fell. A National government was formed, in 1931, with the support of a part of the Labour Party and Conservative and Liberal leaders.\n\nFebruary - October 1974 United Kingdom general election, February 1974 Labour 301, Conservative 297, Liberal 14, Others 23. Total seats 635.\n\nThis election led to the Conservative government of Edward Heath losing its majority, with Harold Wilson's Labour Party winning four more seats. However no two parties (other than Conservative and Labour) could jointly provide a majority in the House of Commons. The balance of power was held jointly by the Liberals and others (Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party, with the Northern Irish members)—who were unlikely to act together.\n\nHeath entered into discussions with the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe. No agreement was reached, mostly because Heath was not prepared to agree to electoral reform. Also, the Liberals were not keen to support a government which had just lost an election (although it did narrowly win the popular vote). In any event, a Conservative-Liberal coalition would have been a minority government and would have needed the support of the Ulster Unionist Party (which had recently broken with the Conservatives) to command a bare majority of seats.\n\nHeath resigned and Wilson then formed a minority government.\n\n2010–2015 United Kingdom general election, 2010 Conservative 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57, Others 29. Total seats 650.\n\nThis election led to David Cameron's Conservative Party being the largest party with no majority. The balance of power was held jointly by the Liberal Democrats and others (the Green Party, Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party, with the Northern Irish members)—who were unlikely to act together.\n\nLabour incumbent Gordon Brown and Cameron announced their intentions to enter discussions with the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, open to signing a deal to allow a government to be formed. Having stated before the election that the party with the largest number of seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour were also held, but Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a stumbling block to formulating a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. Thus, Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September 2010. With Labour attempting to form its own coalition government, the Conservatives promised the Liberal Democrats a referendum on changing the voting mechanism to the Alternative Vote (AV) system. In response Labour said that they would introduce AV then hold a referendum asking the public to approve it.\n\nHowever, by 11 May, the possibility of a Lib-Lab deal was looking unlikely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding that he would not be able to form a government, Gordon Brown announced his resignation on the evening of 11 May. Cameron became Prime Minister and announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. As one of his first moves, Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Later that day, the two parties jointly published the Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement specifying the terms of the coalition deal.\n\n"}
{"id": "706600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=706600", "title": "Bats language", "text": "Bats language\n\nBats (also Batsi, Batsbi, Batsb, Batsaw, Tsova-Tush) is the endangered language of the Bats people, a Caucasian minority group, and is part of the Nakh family of Caucasian languages. It had 2,500 to 3,000 speakers in 1975.\n\nThere is only one dialect. It exists only as a spoken language, as the Bats people use Georgian as their written language. The language is not mutually intelligible with either Chechen or Ingush, the other two members of the Nakh family.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, the Tsovians lived in Tushetia, the mountain region of Northeast Georgia. They were expected to have come settled with Tush people in mid centuries later became assimilated with other Tush people and now are known as one of four tush subgroups. The Tsova Gorge in Tushetia was inhabited by four Bats communities: the Sagirta, Otelta, Mozarta and Indurta. Later they settled on the Kakhetia Plain, in the village of Zemo-Alvani, where they still live. Administratively they are part of the Akhmeta district of Georgia.\n\nBats belongs to the Nakh family of Northeast Caucasian languages.\n\nMost speakers of Bats live in the village of Zemo-Alvani, on the Kakhetia Plain, in the Akhmeta district of Georgia. There are some families of Bats in Tbilisi and other bigger towns in Georgia.\n\nBats has a typical triangular five-vowel system with short–long contrast (except for u, which has no long form). Bats also has a number of diphthongs, ei, ui, oi, ai, ou, and au. All vowels and diphthongs have nasalized allophones that are the result of phonetic and morphophonemic processes; this is represented by a superscript n, as in kʼnateⁿ \"boy-\".\n\nBats has a relatively typical consonant inventory for a Northeast Caucasian language. Unlike its close relatives, Chechen and Ingush, Bats has retained the lateral fricative /ɬ/.\n\nThe first grammar of Bats – \"Über die Thusch-Sprache\" – was compiled by the German orientalist Anton Schiefner (1817–1879) making it into the first grammar of any indigenous Caucasian languages based on sound scientific principles.\n\nTraditional analyses posit that Bats has eight noun classes, the highest number among the Northeast Caucasian languages—however, a more-recent analysis gives only five classes. This analysis (not unlike analyses of Lak) yields the grouping shown below:\nUnder this analysis, the additional three classes are examples of \"inquorate gender\", where the number of items displaying this behavior are insufficient to constitute an independent grouping. Furthermore, they can be explained as inflecting as one class in the singular, and another in the plural, e.g. the B/B group agrees as if it belonged to Bd class in the singular, but male human class in the plural.\n\nBatsbi makes use of nine noun cases total, though in the majority of nouns the ergative and instrumental case have a common form.\n\nLike most of its relatives, Batsbi's numerals are vigesimal, using 20 as a common base. This is mainly evident in the construction of higher decads, so that 40 šauztʼqʼ formed from 2 × 20 and 200 icʼatʼqʼ is 10 × 20. When modifying nominals, the numeral precedes the noun it modifies.\n\nIn Bats, as in the its closest relatives Chechen and Ingush, the number Dʕivʔ \"four\" actually begins with a noun-class marker, represented by D (by default, or another capital for the other classes). This marker will agree in class with the class of the nominal which the number modifies, even if that nominal is not overtly expressed and only apparent through pragmatic or discursive context, as in Vʕivʔev \"four (males)\". This is seen in the word \"four\" itself as well as its derivatives.\n\nBats has explicit inflections for agentivity of a verb; it makes a distinction between ' \"I fell down\" (i.e. through no fault of my own) and ' \"I fell down\" (i.e. and it was my own fault).\n\n"}

{"id": "18863483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18863483", "title": "Chinese family of scripts", "text": "Chinese family of scripts\n\nThe Chinese family of scripts are writing systems descended from the Chinese Oracle Bone Script and used for a variety of languages in East Asia. They include logosyllabic systems such as the Chinese script itself (or \"hanzi\", now in two forms, traditional and simplified), and adaptations to other languages, such as Kanji (Japanese), Hanja (Korean), Chữ nôm (Vietnamese) and sawndip (Zhuang). More divergent are Tangut, Khitan large script, and its offspring Jurchen, as well as Yi script and possibly Korean Hangul, which were inspired by Chinese although not directly descended from it. The partially deciphered Khitan small script may be another. In addition, various phonetic scripts descend from Chinese characters, of which the best known are the various kana syllabaries, the zhuyin semi-syllabary, nüshu, and some influence on hangul.\n\nThe Chinese scripts are written in various calligraphic hands, principally Seal script, Clerical script, Regular script, Semi-cursive script, and Grass script. (See Chinese calligraphy and Chinese script styles.) Adaptations range from the conservative, as in Korean, which used Chinese characters in their standard form with only a few local coinages, and relatively conservative Japanese, which has coined a few hundred new characters and used traditional character forms until the mid-20th century, to the extensive adaptations of Zhuang and Vietnamese, each coining over 10,000 new characters by Chinese formation principles, to the highly divergent Tangut script, which formed over 5,000 new characters by its own principles.\n\nThe earliest Chinese writing consists of divinatory texts inscribed on ox scapulae and tortoise plastrons found at the last Shang dynasty capital near Anyang and dating from 1200 BC.\nThis Oracle Bone Script shows extensive simplification and linearization, which most researchers believe indicates an extensive period of development.\nAlthough some Neolithic symbols have been found on pottery, jade or bone at a variety of sites in China, there is no consensus that any of them are directly related to the Shang oracle bone script.\nBronze inscriptions from about 1100 BC are written in a developed form of the script and provide a richer body of text.\n\nEach character of the early script represents a word of Old Chinese, which at that time was uniformly monosyllabic.\nThe strategies used are traditionally classified into six categories (六書 \"liùshū\" \"six writings\") first recorded in the second century dictionary \"Shuowen Jiezi\".\nThree of these categories involved a representation of the meaning of the word:\nEvolved forms of these characters are still in among the most commonly used today.\n\nWords that could not be represented pictorially, such as abstract terms and grammatical particles, were denoted using characters for similar-sounding words (the rebus strategy).\nThese phonetic loans (假借字 \"jiǎjièzì\") are thus new uses of existing characters rather than new graphic forms.\nAn example is \"lái\" \"come\", written with the character for a similar-sounding word meaning \"wheat\".\nSometimes the borrowed character would be modified slightly to distinguish it from the original, as with \"wú\" \"don't\", a borrowing of \"mǔ\" \"mother\".\n\nPhono-semantic compounds (形聲字 \"xíngshēngzì\") were obtained by adding semantic indicators to disambiguate phonetic loans.\nThis type was already used extensively on the oracle bones, and has been the main source of new characters since then.\nFor example, the character originally representing \"jī\" \"winnowing basket\" was also used to write the pronoun and modal particle \"qí\".\nLater the less common original word was written with the compound , obtained by adding the symbol \"zhú\" \"bamboo\" to the character.\nSometimes the original phonetic similarity has been obscured by millennia of sound change, as in \"gé\" < *\"krak\" \"go to\" and \"lù\" < *\"graks\" \"road\".\nMany characters often explained as semantic compounds were originally phono-semantic compounds that have been obscured in this way.\nSome authors even dispute the validity of the semantic compound category.\n\nThe sixth traditional category (轉注字 \"zhuǎnzhùzì\") contained very few characters, and its meaning is uncertain.\n\nDevelopment and simplification of the script continued during the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn periods, with characters becoming less pictorial and more linear and regular, with rounded strokes being replaced by sharp angles.\nDuring the Warring States period, writing became more widespread, with further simplification and variation, particularly in the eastern states.\nAfter the western state of Qin unified China, its more conservative seal script became the standard for the whole country.\nA simplified form known as the clerical script became the standard during the Han dynasty, and later evolved into the regular script still used today.\nAt the same time semi-cursive and cursive scripts developed.\n\nThe Traditional Chinese script is currently used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.\nMainland China and Singapore use the Simplified Chinese variant.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, formal writing employed Literary Chinese, based on the vocabulary and syntax of classical works.\nThe script was also used less formally to record local varieties, which had over time diverged from the classical language and each other.\nThe logographic script easily accommodated differences in pronunciation, meaning and word order, but often new characters were required for words that could not be related to older forms.\nMany such characters were created using the traditional methods, particularly phono-semantic compounds.\n\nThe Chinese script was for a long period the only writing system in East Asia, and was also hugely influential as the vehicle of the dominant Chinese culture.\nKorea, Japan and Vietnam adopted Chinese literary culture as a whole.\nFor many centuries, all writing in neighbouring societies was done in Classical Chinese, albeit influenced by the writer's native language.\nAlthough they wrote in Chinese, writing about local subjects required characters to represent names of local people and places.\nLater they sought to use the script to write their own languages.\nChinese characters were adapted to represent the words of other languages using a range of strategies, including\nThe principle of representing one monosyllabic word with one character was readily applied to neighbouring languages to the south with a similar analytic structure to Chinese, such as Vietnamese and Zhuang.\nThe script was a poorer fit for the polysyllabic agglutinative languages of the north-east, such as Korean, Japanese and the Mongolic and Tungusic languages.\n\nChinese characters adapted to write Korean are known as \"Hanja\".\nFrom the 9th century, Korean was written using a number of systems collectively known as Idu, in which Hanja were used to write both Sino-Korean and native Korean roots, and a smaller number of Hanja were used to write Korean grammatical morphemes with similar sounds. \nThe overlapping uses of Hanja made the system complex and difficult to use, even when reduced forms for grammatical morphemes were introduced with the Gugyeol system in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nThe Hangul alphabet introduced in the 15th century was much simpler, and specifically designed for the sounds of Korean.\nThe alphabet makes systematic use of modifiers corresponding to features of Korean sounds.\nAlthough Hangul is unrelated to Chinese characters, its letters are written in syllabic blocks that can be interspersed with Hanja. \nSuch a Korean mixed script became the usual way of writing the language, with roots of Chinese origin denoted by Hanja and all other elements rendered in Hangul. Hanja is still used (but not very commonly like the Japanese) and is required in both North and South Korea.\n\nHistorically, a few characters were coined in Korea, such as 畓; these are known as \"gukja\" (國字).\n\nChinese characters adapted to write Japanese words are known as kanji.\nChinese words borrowed into Japanese could be written with the Chinese character, while Japanese words could be written using the character for a Chinese word of similar meaning.\nBecause there have been multiple layers of borrowing into Japanese, a single kanji may have several readings in Japanese.\n\nOther systems, known as kana, used Chinese characters phonetically to transcribe the sounds of Japanese syllables.\nAn early system of this type was Man'yōgana, as used in the 8th century anthology \"Man'yōshū\".\nThis system was not quite a syllabary, because each Japanese syllable could be represented by one of several characters, but from it were derived two syllabaries still in use today.\nThey differ because they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable, and because they used different strategies to reduce these characters for easy writing: the angular katakana were obtained by selecting a part of each character, while hiragana were derived from the cursive forms of whole characters.\nSuch classic works as Lady Murasaki's \"The Tale of Genji\" were written in hiragana, the only system permitted to women of the time.\n\nModern Japanese writing uses a composite system, using kanji for word stems, hiragana for inflexional endings and grammatical words, and katakana to transcribe non-Chinese loanwords.\n\nA few hundred characters have been coined in Japan; these are known as \"kokuji\" (国字), and include natural phenomena, particularly fish, such as 鰯 (sardine), together with everyday terms such as 働 (work) and technical terms such as 腺 (gland).\n\nVietnamese was first written from the 13th century using the \"Chữ nôm\" script based on Chinese characters, but the system developed in a quite different way than in Korea or Japan.\nVietnamese was and is a strongly analytic language with many distinct syllables (roughly 4,800 in the modern standard language), so there was little motivation to develop a syllabary.\nAs with Korean and Japanese, characters were used to write borrowed Chinese words, native words with a similar sound and native words with a similar meaning.\nIn the Vietnamese case, the latter category consisted mainly of early loans from Chinese that had come to be accepted as native.\nThe Vietnamese system also involved creation of new characters using Chinese principles, but on a far greater scale than in Korea or Japan.\nThe resulting system was highly complex and was never mastered by more than 5% of the population.\nIt was completely replaced in the 20th century by the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet.\n\nZhuang has been written using Sawndip for over a thousand years. The script uses both Chinese characters and new characters formed using the traditional methods, as well as some formed by combining pairs of characters to indicate the pronunciation of a word by the \"fanqie\" method. The number of new created characters is similar in scale to the Chu nom of Vietnam. Even though an official alphabet-based writing system for Zhuang was introduced in 1957, Sawndip is still more often used in less formal situations.\n\nSeveral peoples in southwest China recorded laws, songs and other religious and cultural texts by representing words of their languages using a mix of Chinese characters with a similar sound or meaning, or pairs of Chinese characters indicating pronunciation using the \"fanqie\" method.\nThe languages so recorded included Miao, Yao, Bouyei, Kam, Bai and Hani.\nAll these languages are now written using Latin-based scripts.\n\nChinese characters were also used to transcribe the Mongolian text of \"The Secret History of the Mongols\".\n\nBetween the 10th and 13th centuries, northern China was ruled by foreign dynasties that created scripts for their own languages.\nThe Khitan large script and Khitan small script, which in turn influenced the Tangut script and Jurchen script, used characters that superficially resemble Chinese characters, but with the exception of a few loans were constructed using quite different principles.\nIn particular the Khitan small script contained phonetic sub-elements arranged in a square block in a manner similar to the more sophisticated Hangul system devised later for Korean.\n\nOther scripts in China that borrowed or adapted some Chinese characters but are otherwise distinct include Geba script, Sui script, Yi script and the Lisu syllabary.\n\nLogographic: Oracle Bone Script, Seal script, Clerical script, Standard Script, Semi-cursive script, Cursive script, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Khitan script, Jurchen script, Tangut script, Zhuang logogram, Zetian characters, Hanja, Chữ Nôm and Kanji.\n\nSyllabary: Hiragana, Katakana, Man'yōgana, Lisu syllabary, Nüshu script\n\nSemi-syllabary: Zhuyin Fuhao, Gugyeol, Hyangchal, Idu\n\nAlphabetic: Hangul\n\n\n"}

It is named after its inventor, Briggs Cunningham, a victorious America's Cup skipper and yacht builder.\n\nThe cunningham differs from a typical downhaul in the way that it attaches to the sail. The system usually consists of a line which is secured at one end to the mast or boom below the foot of the mainsail. It is then passed through a cringle in the luff of the sail near the foot, but above the tack, and then led down on the other side to a fitting on the mast or boom or on deck.\n\nThe tension in the luff of the sail is adjusted using a combination of the halyard and the cunningham (where fitted). The primary advantage of adjusting the cunningham is the speed and ease with which the luff tension can be changed while sailing or racing. By either hauling or easing the line, the tension in the luff can be changed, thereby shifting the point of maximum draft of the sail forward or aft respectively, optimizing sail shape and thus performance. It is a fine control which is used more frequently on racing sailboats than on cruising or day-sailing boats.\n\n"}

It comes from Indonesian \"desa\" \"village\" and kota \"city\". Desakota areas typically occur in Asia, especially South East Asia. Examples can be found in the urbanised regions of Java, the densely populated, delta-shaped areas on the peripheries of the Jakarta agglomeration (\"Jabodetabek\"), but also the extended metropolitan regions of Bangkok or Manila.\n\nDesakota areas are situated outside the periurban zones, from which daily commuting is easily possible, i.e. more than 30 or 50 km off the city centre. They often sprawl alongside arterial and communication roads, sometimes from one agglomeration to the next. They are characterised by high population density and intensive agricultural use (especially wet-rice cultivation), but differ from densely populated rural areas by more urban-like characteristics. These criteria are: developed transport networks, high population mobility, increasing activity outside the agricultural sector, the coexistence of many different forms of land use, more female participation in paid labour, and unregulated land use.\n\nGiven their rambling extent and indistinct boundaries, the emergence of Desakota regions brings difficulties for the administration, as uniform plans, regulations or designs are hardly viable. Desakota regions are characterised by high mobility of goods and services and rapid change in patterns of settlement. They usually elude the division in functually specialised zones that is conventionally applied in urban geography. Completely different forms of use, as e.g. traditional agriculture, large scale and cottage industry, amusement parks and golf courses, shopping centres and retail parks, and forms of settlement from shanty towns to gated community coexist in them close to each other.\n\nOutside South East Asia, areas with comparable features have been described in China, India, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.\n\n\n"}

Sometimes called the press junket or film junket, film promotion generally includes press releases, advertising campaigns, merchandising, franchising, media and interviews with the key people involved with the making of the film, like actors and directors. As with all business, it is an important part of any release because of the inherent high financial risk; film studios will invest in expensive marketing campaigns to maximize revenue early in the release cycle. Marketing budgets tend to equal about half the production budget. Publicity is generally handled by the distributor and exhibitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilm actors, directors, and producers appear for television, cable, radio, print, and online media interviews, which can be conducted in person or remotely. During film production, these can take place \"on set\". After the film's premiere, key personnel make appearances in major market cities or participate remotely via satellite videoconference or telephone. The purpose of interviews is to encourage journalists to publish stories about their \"exclusive interviews\" with the film's stars, thereby creating \"marketing buzz\" around the film and stimulating audience interest in watching the film.\n\nWhen it comes to feature films picked up by a major film studio for international distribution, promotional tours are notoriously grueling. Key cast and crew are often contracted to travel to several major cities around the world to promote the film and sit for dozens of interviews. In every interview they are supposed to stay \"on message\" by energetically expressing their enthusiasm for the film in a way that appears candid, fun, and fresh, even though it may be their fifth or sixth interview that day. They are expected to disclose just enough juicy \"behind-the-scenes\" information about the filmmaking process or the filmmakers' artistic vision to make each journalist feel like he or she got a nice scoop, while at the same time tactfully avoiding disclosure of anything truly negative or embarrassing.\n\nThere are seven distinct types of research conducted by film distributors in connection with domestic theatrical releases, according to \"Marketing to Moviegoers: Second Edition.\" Such audience research can cost $1 million per film, especially when scores of TV advertisements are tested and re-tested. The bulk of research is done by major studios for the roughly 170 major releases they mount each year that are supported by tens of millions of advertising buys for each film. Independent film distributors, which typically spend less than $10 million in media buys per film, don’t have the budget or breadth of advertising materials to analyze, so they spend little or nothing on pre-release audience research.\nWhen audience research is conducted for domestic theatrical release, it involves these areas:\n\nMarketing can play a big role in whether or not a film gets the green light. Audience research is a strong factor in determining the ability of a film to sell in theaters, which is ultimately how films make their money. As part of a movie's Marketing strategy, audience research comes into account as producers create promotional materials. These promotional materials consistently change and evolve as a direct consequence of audience research up until the film opens in theaters.\n"}

The website's purpose is to enable minority language speakers to communicate on the Internet.\n\nOn its homepage, the website displays a list of minority languages it has cached. After selecting a language, the user is brought to a table of everyone who is tweeting in that language. Indigenous Tweets provides the profile picture of each Twitter user and statistics about each person's number of followers. In addition to providing statistics about the percentage of tweets a person writes in different languages, Indigenous Tweets has a selection of the trending topics in the various minority languages.\n\nAt the website's inception in March 2011, it cataloged 35 languages. On April 16, 2011, it recorded tweets in 76 minority languages. By April 26, 2011, the website supported 82. The cataloged languages include the \"esoteric\" Gamilaraay and the \"better-known\" Haitian Creole and Basque, which have the first and second most Tweeters, respectively.

It differs greatly from the Korean dialects of the mainland. Standard Korean is the most common form of communication in Korea, whereas the Jeju dialect is considered a very local language. The Jeju language is mainly understood and spoken by the older generation. As of October 2014, the Jeju National University Foreign Language Institute has made efforts to save the fading language. Currently, only a relatively small group, consisting of around, or even fewer than, ten thousand individuals actively speak the language.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Endangered Languages, the Jeju language is listed as \"critically endangered\", the highest level of being endangered. Only 5,000–10,000 people speak the Jeju language, all of whom are above 70–75 years of age. Without a province-wide teaching mechanism of the Jeju language for the youth, the language may be extinct within 2–4 decades, making it a language in grave peril unless a teaching-mechanism is established by either the government or an educational institution in Jeju-do.\n\nThe name is transcribed \"Jeju\" in Revised Romanization and \"Cheju\" in McCune–Reischauer. In Korean, it is known as () \"Jeju bang-eon\" or \"Jeju saturi\" \"Jeju dialect\", as () \"Jejueo\" \"Jeju language\", or as \"Jejumal\" \"Jeju speech\". The last term, \"mal\" means both \"language\" and \"dialect\".\n\nAlthough many South Koreans, including those who speak Jeju, consider it a dialect of the Korean language, it can be considered a separate language because it is mutually unintelligible with the Korean dialects on the mainland. Japanese and Mongolian are also incorporated into Jeju, indicating further separation from Standard Korean. Jeju is characterized by a heavy accent containing many informal words and phrases, considered to be Korean slang. It has been recognized as a distinct language locally and by UNESCO. Glottolog also classifies it as a distinct language. Government support of this language is provided through the Jeju Ministry of Education, and institutional support is provided by the Jeju Preservation Society.\n\nThere are around 5,000–10,000 fluent speakers today. Jeju was once spoken across Jeju Island, apart from the Chuja islands in the former Bukjeju County (currently Jeju City), where the \"Chuja dialect\", a variety of the Jeolla dialect, is spoken. It also survives in diasporic enclaves in Japan.\n\nDomestic efforts have been carried out in an attempt to revitalize the language, such as the publication of a Jeju-eo-to-Korean dictionary and the establishment of the Jeju Development Institute. However, it has been difficult to see progress due to a widening cultural and generational gap.\n\nIn January 2011, UNESCO added Jeju to its \"Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger\" as a \"critically endangered language\".\n\nThe phonetic properties of obstruents in Jeju dialect is similar to Seoul Korean. The unintelligibility of Jeju comes in larger part from other components of grammar such as morphosyntactic and/or lexical differences, e.g. differences in the vowel system.\n\nThere are 9 vowels:\n\nJeju maintains the a\"rae-a\" vowel ㆍ , which has been lost from standard Korean.\n\nPresumably pronounced similar to modern ㅓ, but with less opening at the back of the throat.\n\nTheㆍvowel formed a medial of its own, or was found in the diphthong ㆎ \"arae-ae\", written with the dot under the consonant and ㅣ to its right.\n\nThis vowel is not entirely obsolete outside of Jeju, as it can be found in various brand names. It is often just an aesthetic replacement for the ㅏ vowel in standard Korean.\n\n\nA notable difference between Jeju and the dialects of mainland Korea is a lack of speech formality or honorific deference. For example, while a speaker of the Gyeonggi dialect might say \"annyeong haseyo\" (\"Hello\") or \"ban'gapseumnida\" (\"Pleasure to meet you\") to an older person, a speaker of the Jeju dialect would say \"ban'gapsuda\", which would be roughly equivalent to \"Howdy\" or \"Nice ta meet ya\" in Gyeonggi dialect. In mainland Korea, it would be inappropriate for a child to say this to an adult, but this usage is normative in Jeju. This is also what caused a further division of language between Jeju island and mainland Korea; Jejueo was dubbed inferior to the standard Korean because of its casual tone and lack of the formal morphemes such as 요 (yo) in 안녕하세요 (an-nyong ha-sae-yo \"hello\").\n\nJeju preserves many archaic words which have been lost elsewhere, and has borrowed foreign words that are not found in standard Korean. Many words come from the Japanese, Chinese, Manchu and Mongolian languages.\n\nJeju honorifics differ from Standard Korean. Where the standard has declarative ㅂ니다 \"-mnida\", Jeju has 암/엄수다 \"-amsuda\" or \"-eomsuda.\" Where Korean has interrogative ㅂ니까? \"-mnikka?\", Jeju has 암/엄수과? \"-a/eomsugwa?\"\n\nStative verbs (\"adjectives\") are similar. Where standard has ㅂ니다/까 \"-mnida/mnikka\" or 습니다/까 \"-seumnida/seumnikka\", Jeju has 우다/꽈 \"-uda/uggwa\" or 수다/꽈 \"-suda/suggwa\".\n\nJeju past declarative 앗/엇수다 \"-assuda/eossuda\" corresponds to standard 았/었습니다 \"-asseumnida/eusseumnida\" and interrogative 앗/엇수과? \"-assugwa/-eossugwa\" to standard 았/었습니까? \"-asseumnikka/eosseumnikka\".\n\n"}

Despite being the best known local academic proponent of reversing language shift measures, he has never held a stable university post in the Basque Country.\n\nNicknamed Txepetx (wren in Basque language), he is an Anglo-Germanic Philology graduate from the University of Salamanca and Basque Philology doctorate from the University of the Basque Country, he has served as a Spanish teacher in Scotland, scientific English teacher at the University of Granada, Basque teacher in a rural school of Navarre, and professor of modern languages and literature of Secondary Education in the Basque Autonomous Community and elsewhere in Spain.\n\nHis research on sociolinguistics, the theory of bilingualism and existential linguistics, includes the following works: \"El estado actual del vascuence en la provincia de Navarra (1970)\" [The current state of Basque language in Navarre (1970)] (1972), \"Bilingüismo, diglosia y contacto de lenguas\" [Bilingualism, diglossia, and language contact] (\"ASJU\", 1974), \"Lengua y pueblo\" [Language and people] (1980) with articles from 1977 originally published in \"Punto y Hora de Euskal Herria\" magazine, \"El marco sociológico y espacial en una situación bilingüe\" [The sociological and spatial context in a bilingual setting] (UPV/EHU, 1980), and \"El espacio bilingüe\" [The bilingual space] (1981).\n\nSánchez Carrión's insistence on the necessity of compacting Basque speakers has been often cited by advocates of the territorial principle of linguistic rights. Significantly the only article in the 1982 Basque Autonomous Community Law for the Normalisation of the use of the Basque language based on the territorial principle, was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Spain.\n\nFar removed from the variational sociolinguistics as from ideological interpretations, he attempts to answer with new perspectives to the problem of why and how languages live and die. He's been a proponent of ecolinguistics since the mid-eighties of the 20th century. However, his most notorious work is his doctoral thesis \"Un futuro para nuestro pasado\" [A future for our past] (1987), as it has offered to many Basque language loyalists a theoretical framework for their activity. Further expanding the sociohistorical linguistics approach of his doctoral thesis, he wrote \"Las lenguas vistas desde la historia versus la historia vista desde las lenguas\" [Languages seen from the point of view of history versus history seen from the point of view of languages] (EI-SEV, 1992). In 1999 the Bilbao City Council published Sánchez Carrión's book \"Aplicación sociolingüística de la territorialidad\" [Sociolinguistic application of territoriality].\n\nSánchez Carrión's importance for the Basque studies was stressed early on by scholar Koldo Mitxelena, and this acknowledgment has continued thereafter. The Basque association Garabide Elkartea participated in the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in April 2010, where it presented the book \"The Basque experience\", which makes extensive use of Sánchez Carrión's sociolinguistics.\n\nIn 2013 he published a book about religion and theology entitled \"Le code Jean le Baptiste\" [Code John the Baptist] translated into French by Alain Masson.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "899930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=899930", "title": "Language interpretation", "text": "Language interpretation\n\nInterpreting is a translational activity in which one produces a first and final translation on the basis of a one-time exposure to an expression in a source language.\n\nThe most common two modes of interpreting are simultaneous interpreting, which is done at the time of the exposure to the source language, and consecutive interpreting, which is done at breaks to this exposure.\n\nInterpreting is an ancient human activity which predates the invention of writing. However, the origins of the profession of interpreting date back to less than a century ago.\n\nResearch on the numerous sides of the history of interpreting is quite new. For as long as most scholarly interest was given to professional conference interpreting, very little academic work was done on the practice of interpreting in history, and until the 1990s, only a few dozen publications were done on it.\n\nConsidering the amount of interpreting activities that is assumed to have occurred for thousands of years, historical records are limited. Moreover, interpreters and their work have usually not found their way into the history books. One of the reasons for that is the dominance of the written text over the spoken word (in the sense that those who have left written texts are more likely to be recorded by historians). Another problem is the tendency to view it as an ordinary support activity which does not require any special attention, and the social status of interpreters, who were sometimes treated unfairly by scribes, chroniclers and historians. \n\nOur knowledge of the past of interpreting tends to come from letters, chronicles, biographies, diaries and memoirs, along with a variety of other documents and literary works, many of which (and with few exceptions) were only incidentally or marginally related to interpreting.\n\nMany Indo-European languages have words for 'interpreting' and 'interpreter'. Expressions in Germanic, Scandinavian and Slavic languages denoting an interpreter can be traced back to Akkadian, around 1900 BCE. The Akkadian root \"targumânu\"/\"turgumânu\" also gave rise to the term dragoman via an etymological sideline from Arabic.\n\nThe English word ‘interpreter’, however, is derived from Latin \"interpres\" (meaning ‘expounder’, ‘person explaining what is obscure’), whose semantic roots are not clear. Some scholars take the second part of the word to be derived from \"partes\" or \"pretium\" (meaning ‘price’, which fits the meaning of a ‘middleman’, ‘intermediary’ or ‘commercial go-between’), but others have suggested a Sanskrit root.\n\nIn consecutive interpreting (CI), the interpreter starts to interpret when the speaker pauses. Therefore, the time needed is much greater (possibly double the time needed). Traditionally, the interpreter will sit or stand near the speaker.\n\nConsecutive interpretation can be conducted in a pattern of short or long segments according to the interpreter's preference. In short CI, the interpreter relies mostly on memory whereas, in long CI, most interpreters will rely on note-taking. The notes must be clear and legible in order to not waste time on reading them. Consecutive interpreting of whole thoughts, rather than in small pieces, is desirable so that the interpreter has the whole meaning before rendering it in the target language. This affords a truer, more accurate, and more accessible interpretation than where short CI or simultaneous interpretation is used.\n\nAn attempt at consensus about lengths of segments may be reached prior to commencement, depending upon complexity of the subject matter and purpose of the interpretation, though speakers generally face difficulty adjusting to unnatural speech patterns.\n\nOn occasion, document sight translation is required of the interpreter during consecutive interpretation work. Sight translation combines interpretation and translation; the interpreter must render the source-language document to the target-language as if it were written in the target language. Sight translation occurs usually, but not exclusively, in judicial and medical work.\n\nConsecutive interpretation may be the chosen mode when bilingual listeners are present who wish to hear both the original and interpreted speech or where, as in a court setting, a record must be kept of both.\n\nWhen no interpreter is available to interpret directly from source to target, an intermediate interpreter will be inserted in a relay mode, e.g. a Greek source language could be interpreted into English and then from English to another language. This is also commonly known as double-interpretation. Triple-interpretation may even be needed, particularly where rare languages or dialects are involved. Such interpretation can only be effectively conducted using consecutive interpretation.\n\nSimultaneous interpretation (SI) suffers the disadvantage that if a person is performing the service the interpreter must do the best he or she can within the time permitted by the pace of source speech. However they also have the advantages of saving time and not disturbing the natural flow of the speaker. SI can also be accomplished by software where the program can simultaneously listen to incoming speech and speak the associated interpretation. With a software-based interpretation system the speaker does not have to pause or wait for the interpreter before speaking additional sentences. The most common form is extempore SI, where the interpreter does not know the message until he or she hears it.\n\nSimultaneous interpretation using electronic equipment where the interpreter can hear the speaker's voice as well as the interpreter's own voice was introduced at the Nuremberg trials in 1945. The equipment facilitated large numbers of listeners, and interpretation was offered French, Russian, German and English. The technology arose in the 1920s and 1930s when American businessman Edward Filene and British engineer Alan Gordon Finlay developed simultaneous interpretation equipment with IBM. Yvonne Kapp attended a conference with simultaneous translation in 1935 in the Soviet Union. As it proved successful, IBM was able to sell the equipment to the United Nations. SI using software-based systems was introduced by SpeechGear in 2004.\n\nIn the ideal setting for oral language, the interpreter sits in a sound-proof booth and speaks into a microphone, while clearly seeing and hearing the source-language speaker via earphones. The simultaneous interpretation is rendered to the target-language listeners via their earphones.\n\nPavel Palazchenko's \"My Years with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze: The Memoir of a Soviet Interpreter\" gives an excellent short history of modern interpretation and of the transition from its consecutive to simultaneous forms:\n\nPavel Palazchenko, \"My Years with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze: The Memoir of a Soviet Interpreter\" (Pennsylvania University Press, 1997), pp. 32–33.\n\nSince time immemorial, whispering interpretation has been used, known in the trade by the French term \"chuchotage\". To avoid disturbing the original speaker and those present listening to the original speaker, the interpreter's voice is kept at a low volume. To do this, the interpreter and the person requiring interpretation must sit or stand in close proximity to one another. No actual whispering is involved as this is difficult to decipher as well as being too much of a strain on the voice: the interpreter uses normal 'voiced' speech at a low volume. Only one or at the most two people in need of interpretation can be accommodated, unless portable electronic equipment is used.\n\nThis form of interpretation puts a strain on the interpreter who has to sit for long periods leaning towards the person in need of interpretation.\n\nConference interpreting refers to interpretation at a conference or large meeting, either simultaneously or consecutively. The advent of multi-lingual meetings has reduced the amount of consecutive interpretation in the last 20 years.\n\nConference interpretation is divided between two markets: institutional and private. International institutions (EU, UN, EPO, et cetera), which hold multilingual meetings, often favor interpreting several foreign languages into the interpreters' mother tongues. Local private markets tend to have bilingual meetings (the local language plus another), and the interpreters work both into and out of their mother tongues. These markets are not mutually exclusive. The International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC) is the only worldwide association of conference interpreters. Founded in 1953, its membership includes more than 2,800 professional conference interpreters, in more than 90 countries.\n\nJudicial, legal, or court interpreting occurs in courts of justice, administrative tribunals, and wherever a legal proceeding is held (i.e., a police station for an interrogation, a conference room for a deposition, or the locale for taking a sworn statement). Legal interpreting can be the consecutive interpretation of witnesses' testimony, for example, or the simultaneous interpretation of entire proceedings, by electronic means, for one person, or all of the people attending. In a legal context, where ramifications of misinterpretation may be dire, accuracy is paramount. Teams of two or more interpreters, with one actively interpreting and the second monitoring for greater accuracy, may be deployed.\n\nThe right to a competent interpreter for anyone who does not understand the language of the court (especially for the accused in a criminal trial) is usually considered a fundamental rule of justice. Therefore, this right is often guaranteed in national constitutions, declarations of rights, fundamental laws establishing the justice system or by precedents set by the highest courts. However, it is not a constitutionally required procedure (in the United States) that a certified interpreter be present at police interrogation. This has been especially controversial in cases where illegal immigrants with no English skills are accused of crimes.\n\nIn the US, depending upon the regulations and standards adhered to per state and venue, court interpreters usually work alone when interpreting consecutively, or as a team, when interpreting simultaneously. In addition to practical mastery of the source and target languages, thorough knowledge of law and legal and court procedures is required of court interpreters. They are often required to have formal authorization from the state to work in the courts – and then are called certified court interpreters. In many jurisdictions, the interpretation is considered an essential part of the evidence. Incompetent interpretation, or simply failure to swear in the interpreter, can lead to a mistrial.\n\nIn escort interpreting, an interpreter accompanies a person or a delegation on a tour, on a visit, or to a business meeting or interview. An interpreter in this role is called an \"escort interpreter\" or an \"escorting interpreter\". An escort interpreter’s work session may run for days, weeks, or even months, depending on the period of the client’s visit. This type of interpreting is often needed in business contexts, during presentations, investor meetings, and business negotiations. As such, and escort interpreter needs to be equipped with some business and financial knowledge in order to best understand and convey messages back and forth.\n\nAlso known as community interpreting, is the type of interpreting occurring in fields such as legal, health, and local government, social, housing, environmental health, education, and welfare services. In community interpreting, factors exist which determine and affect language and communication production, such as speech's emotional content, hostile or polarized social surroundings, its created stress, the power relationships among participants, and the interpreter's degree of responsibility – in many cases more than extreme; in some cases, even the life of the other person depends upon the interpreter's work.\n\nMedical interpreting is a subset of public service interpreting, consisting of communication among Healthcare personnel and the patient and their family or among Healthcare personnel speaking different languages, facilitated by an interpreter, usually formally educated and qualified to provide such interpretation services. In some situations medical employees who are multilingual may participate part-time as members of internal language banks. Depending on country/state specific requirements, the interpreter is often required to have some knowledge of medical terminology, common procedures, the patient interview and exam process. Medical interpreters are often cultural liaisons for people (regardless of language) who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable in hospital, clinical, or medical settings.\n\nFor example, in China, there is no mandatory certificate for medical interpreters as of 2012. Most interpretation in hospitals in China is done by doctors, who are proficient in both Chinese and English (mostly) in his/her specialty. They interpret more in academic settings than for communications between doctors and patients. When a patient needs English language service in a Chinese hospital, more often than not the patient will be directed to a staff member in the hospital, who is recognized by his/her colleagues as proficient in English. The actual quality of such service for patients or medical translation for communications between doctors speaking different languages is unknown by the interpreting community as interpreters who lack Healthcare background rarely receive accreditation for medical translation in the medical community. Interpreters working in the Healthcare setting may be considered Allied Health Professionals.\n\nIn the United States, however, providing a Medical Interpreter is required by law. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity that receives Federal funds or other Federal financial assistance. Because hospitals are federally funded, they are required by this law to provide a professional interpreter to any patient that may need one.\n\nA sign language interpreter must accurately convey messages between two different languages. An interpreter is there for both deaf and hearing individuals. The act of interpreting occurs when a hearing person speaks, and an interpreter renders the speaker's meaning into sign language, or other forms used by the deaf party(ies). The interpreting also happens in reverse: when a deaf person signs, an interpreter renders the meaning expressed in the signs into the oral language for the hearing party, which is sometimes referred to as voice interpreting or \"voicing\". This may be performed either as simultaneous or consecutive interpreting. Skilled sign language interpreters will position themselves in a room or space that allows them to be seen by the deaf participants and heard clearly by hearing participants, as well as be in a position to hear and/or see the speaker or speakers clearly. In some circumstances, an interpreter may interpret from one language to another whether that is English to British Sign Language, English to American Sign Language, Spanish to English to American Sign Language and so on.\n\nDeaf individuals also have the opportunity to work as interpreters. If they are certified they are refereed to as a CDI (certified Deaf Interpreter), if not they would be called a DI (Deaf Interpreter). The Deaf individual will team with a hearing counterpart to provide interpretation for deaf individuals who may not know the same sign language used in that country, who have minimal language skills, are developmentally delayed, have other mental and/or physical disabilities which make communication a unique challenge, or request one. In other cases the hearing interpreter may interpret in the sign language, whichever kind of sign language the team knows and the deaf team will then interpret into the language in which the individual can understand. They also interpret information from one medium of language into another – for example, when a person is signing visually, the deaf interpreter could be hired to copy those signs into a deaf-blind person's hand and add visual information.\n\nSome interpreters have been formally trained in an Interpreter Training Program (ITP), though this is not always required. ITP lengths vary, and are usually two or four years to obtain a degree or certificate. Graduate programs are also available.\n\nIn the United States, Sign Language interpreters have National and some states have aState level certifications. The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID), a non-profit organization, is known for its national recognition and certification process. In addition to training requirements and stringent certification testing, the RID members must abide by a Code of Professional Conduct, Grievance Process and Continuing Education Requirement. There are many interpreter-training programs in the U.S. The Collegiate Commission on Interpreter Education is the body that accredits Interpreter Preparation Programs. A list of accredited programs can be found on the CCIE web site.\n\nEuropean countries and countries elsewhere have their own national association of Sign Language Interpreters. Some countries have more than one national association due to regional or language differences. The European Forum of Sign Language Interpreters (efsli) is the umbrella organization of sign language interpreters in Europe. In Canada, the professional association that recognizes and nationally certifies sign language interpreters is the Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada (AVLIC). Under AVLIC holds several affiliate chapters representing a specified region of Canada.\n\nSign language interpreters encounter a number of linguistic, environmental, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors that can have an effect on their ability to provide accurate interpretation. Studies have found that most interpreter training programs do not sufficiently prepare students for the highly variable day-to-day stresses that an interpreter must manage, and there is an ongoing conversation in the interpreting field as to how to appropriately prepare students for the challenges of the job. Proposed changes include having a more robust definition of what a qualified interpreter should know, as well as a post-graduate internship structure that would allow new interpreters to work with the benefit of supervision from more experienced interpreters, much like the programs in place in medicine, law enforcement, etc.\n\nBy its very nature, media interpreting has to be conducted in the simultaneous mode. It is provided particularly for live television coverages such as press conferences, live or taped interviews with political figures, musicians, artists, sportsmen or people from the business circle. In this type of interpreting, the interpreter has to sit in a sound-proof booth where ideally he/she can see the speakers on a monitor and the set. All equipment should be checked before recording begins. In particular, satellite connections have to be double-checked to ensure that the interpreter's voice is not sent back and the interpreter gets to hear only one channel at a time. In the case of interviews recorded outside the studio and some current affairs program, the interpreter interprets what he or she hears on a TV monitor. Background noise can be a serious problem. The interpreter working for the media has to sound as slick and confident as a television presenter.\n\nMedia interpreting has gained more visibility and presence especially after the Gulf War. Television channels have begun to hire staff simultaneous interpreters. The interpreter renders the press conferences, telephone beepers, interviews and similar live coverage for the viewers. It is more stressful than other types of interpreting as the interpreter has to deal with a wide range of technical problems coupled with the control room's hassle and wrangling during live coverage.\n\nInterpreting services can be delivered in multiple modalities.The most common modality through which interpreting services are provided is on-site interpreting.\n\nAlso called \"in-person interpreting\" or sometimes colloquialized as \"face-to-face\", this delivery method requires the interpreter to be physically present in order for the interpretation to take place. In on-site interpreting settings, all of the parties who wish to speak to one another are usually located in the same place. This is by far the most common modality used for most public and social service settings.\n\nAlso referred to as \"over-the-phone interpreting,\" \"telephonic interpreting,\" and \"tele-interpreting,\" telephone interpreting enables interpretation via telephone. Telephone interpreting can be used in community settings as well as conference settings. Telephone interpreting may be used in place of on-site interpreting when no on-site interpreter is readily available at the location where services are needed. However, it is more commonly used for situations in which all parties who wish to communicate are already speaking to one another via telephone (e.g. telephone applications for insurance or credit cards, or telephone inquiries from consumers to businesses).\n\nInterpretation services via Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) or a Video Relay Service (VRS) are useful for spoken language barriers where visual-cultural recognition is relevant, and even more applicable where one of the parties is deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired (mute). In such cases the direction of interpretation is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (FSL) to spoken French and Spanish Sign Language (SSL) to spoken Spanish. Multilingual sign language interpreters, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as to and from SSL, to and from spoken English), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction and syntax, different from the aural version of the same principal language.\n\nWith video interpreting, sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, converse with the hearing party and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRI and VRS interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera, in order to zoom in and out, and to point the camera toward the party that is signing.\n\nThe majority of professional full-time conference interpreters work for phone interpreting agencies, health care institutions, courts, school systems and international organizations like the United Nations, the European Union, or the African Union.\n\nThe world's largest employer of interpreters is currently the European Commission, which employs hundreds of staff and freelance interpreters working into the official languages of the European Union and some others. The European Union's other institutions (the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice) have smaller interpreting services.\n\nThe United Nations employs interpreters at almost all its sites throughout the world. Because it has only six official languages, however, it is a smaller employer than the European Union.\n\nInterpreters may also work as freelance operators in their local, regional and national communities, or may take on contract work under an interpreting business or service. They would typically take on work as described above.\n\nMilitaries often use interpreters to better communicate with the local population. One notable example is the US military during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThere are a number of interpreting and translation associations around the world, including NAATI (National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters), AIIC (The International Association of Conference Interpreters), CATTI (China Accreditation Test for Translators and Interpreters), CTTIC (Canadian Translators, Terminologists and Interpreters Council), and the Institute of Translation & Interpreting, in the UK.\n\nNo worldwide testing or certification agency exists for all types of interpreters. For conference interpretation, there is the International Association of Conference Interpreters, or AIIC.\n\nSpecific regions, countries, or even cities will have their own certification standards. In many cases, graduates of a certain caliber university program acts as a de facto certification for conference interpretation.\n\nThe most recognized interpretation & translation certificate in P.R.C. is China Accreditation Test for Translation and Interpretation, short for CATTI.\nIt is entrusted by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of P.R.C. It is a translation and interpretation professional qualification accreditation test which is implemented throughout the country according to uniform standards, in order to assess examinees' bilingual translation or interpretation capability.\nCATTI was introduced in 2003. In later 2013, translation and interpreting tests of different levels in English, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Spanish and Arabic were held across the nation.\n\nThose examinees who pass CATTI and obtain translation and interpretation certificates acquire corresponding translation and interpretation professional titles.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant institutions from Australia, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and other countries as well as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the region of Taiwan have established work ties with CATTI.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the father of leading cyber security expert Professor Anupam Joshi.\n\nHe died on 30 March 2006, at the age of 73, in New Delhi, India. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Bhagwati Joshi, and sons, Anupam Joshi, Anurag Joshi and Ashish Joshi. Upon his death, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called him \"one of the most influential writers and commentators in Hindi in recent times\".\n\nAccording to Khushwant Singh, the eminent author, editor and critic,\"By the time he died in 2006, he was recognised as the first and the most innovative writer of Hindi.\"\n\nHe is often called \"the Father of Indian Soap Operas\" being the writer of India's first television soap opera, \"Hum Log\". Made in 1982, when television was still a luxury item for the majority of Indians, the serial dealt with the everyday struggles of the middle-class India, making it an instant hit, especial because every Indian could identify with it. Another popular creation was \"Buniyaad\" (1987–1988), directed by Ramesh Sippy, a serial based around the life a family displaced by the Partition of India in 1947; both went on to deeply influence an entire generation of Indians as well as the Indian television industry.\n\nIn the following years he wrote many more long running serials like \"Mungeri Lal Ke Hasin Sapney\", \"Kakaji Kahin\", \"Humrahi\", \"Zameen Aasman\" and \"Gatha\".\n\nManohar Shyam Joshi is also known for his novels which have dealt with topics ranging from love, in \"Kasap\", described as one of the greatest love stories in Hindi, to devastating political satire like \"Netaji Kahin\".\n\nHe was a prominent post-modernist authors in modern Hindi literature, as amiably demonstrated by his cult novel \"Kuru kuru Swaahaa\" and his novella \"Hariya Hercules ki Hairaani\". He was awarded the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Award in 2005 for Hindi, for his novel \"Kyap\", an allegory of modern India, known for its sensitive portrayal of the Kumaoni traditions of his home state of Uttarakhand.\n\nHe had a penchant for romance, subtle comedy and satire alike. This allowed him to write for cinema on a variety of subjects, like \"Hey Ram\", \"Appu Raja\", \"Papa Kahte Hain\" and \"Brashtachar\". He was a dubbing expert of much ability and dubbed for films like \"Appu Raja\" and \"Hey Ram\".\n\nHe had a long stint as a journalist in broadcast and the print media. He worked first with All India Radio, New Delhi, in the Hindi news section and then with the Films Division of India in Mumbai, where he wrote the scripts for many documentaries. This is when he started writing his famous landmark interviews with ordinary folks, which were serialised in the \"Sarika\" magazine. It was not long before he was handpicked by Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayan Agyeya for a new Hindi news magazine \"Dinmaan\", being brought out by the \"Times of India\" group. Agyeya was to be the editor and Joshi the assistant editor.\n\nLater, he concurrently edited the leading Hindi magazine \"Saptahik Hindustan\", along with the English \"Weekend Review\" and, in late 70s, the \"Morning Echo\" weekly all brought out by the \"Hindustan Times\".\n\nHis journalistic writings have covered a wide range of topics from popular science and scintillating travelogues to astute political analyses. Until his death, he wrote an opinion column for \"Outlook Saptahik\", Hindi magazine from \"Outlook India\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37769260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37769260", "title": "Multimedia translation", "text": "Multimedia translation\n\nMultimedia translation, also sometimes referred to as Audiovisual translation, is a specialized branch of translation which deals with the transfer of multimodal and multimedial texts into another language and/or culture. and which implies the use of a multimedia electronic system in the translation or in the transmission process.\n\nMultimedia translation can be applied to various fields, including cinema, television, theatre, advertisement, audiovisual and mobile device communication.\n\nAudiovisual text can be labeled as multimodal when produced and interpreted by applying a variety of semiotic resources or ‘modes’. When various modes, such as language, image, music, colour and perspective are combined together in different forms of media, with the major role attributed to the screen, audiovisual text can be described as multimedial.\n\nAn example of this, called multimodal transcription, is used in cinema. A film is broken down into frames, shots or phases. Every frame, shot or phase is analyzed, looking for all the semiotic modalities operating within each one.\n\nThe translation of multimedia creative works is a subject of academic research, a subtopic of translation studies. This interdisciplinary field draws from a wide range of theories, such as globalisation and post-globalisation theories, reception studies, relevance theory, social science and cultural studies, social psychology and deaf studies.\n\nThis kind of translation is strongly influenced, both in the form and in the substance of its creative process, by the process and type of device employed. Specific limits are imposed by digital graphics, and by timing and mode of use.\n\nDubbing, sometimes known as \"lip-synchrony\", involves both the translation and its synchronisation as well as dubbing the actors' and actresses' performance. Once considered the most comprehensive form of translation, dubbing follows the \"timing, phrasing and lip movement of the original dialogue\" as closely as possible. Although this mode is usually interlingual, there are some cases of intralingual dubbing, but it is not very common.\n\nThe most extensively studied mode of multimedia translation, subtitling is the linguistic practice showing written text on a screen that conveys \"a target language version of the source speech.\" Consisting of many sub-types, the one most commonly used is interlinguistic subtitling, which is usually displayed in open captions. In places where several languages are spoken, bilingual subtitles are used to show two different language versions of the source text at the same time.\n\nVoice over involves the original soundtrack and the translation being broadcast simultaneously. At the beginning, only the original can be heard, but the volume is lowered while the translated version becomes more noticeable until the end. This mode of multimedia translation gives a realistic effect, so it is usually used in documentaries or interviews. Voice over is considered a \"cheap alternative to dubbing\" so it is the first choice for translating films in former Communist states and some countries in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nInterpreting is \"the oral translation of an audiovisual product by only one speaker.\" Interpreting consists of many different types, such as simultaneous, live, consecutive or prerecorded. This mode is usually used in live interviews and news broadcasts.\n\nSurtitling is similar to subtitling, however it consists of one continuous line displayed with no interruption. Becoming more frequent in theatres and operahouses, the translation is displayed either above the stage or on the backs of seats. Despite being shown in real time, the translations are prepared in advance.\n\nFree commentary is the variation of an audiovisual source to an entirely new audience and the cultural factors or new goals involved. It is delivered with a spontaneous tone, so the end product is completely different from the original. There is generally no attempt to stay faithful to it, resulting in a translation that usually provides either more details or omissions. This mode of multimedia translation is generally used when literacy is not the main goal, such as in children's television shows, documentaries, humorous videos, film parodies and corporate videos.\n\nAlso known as \"half-dubbing\" or \"concise synchronisation\", consists of adding a prerecorded spoken text to the original soundtrack. While not being a full translation, it provides the necessary information in the target language.\n\nNarration consists of preparing, translating and condensing a text in advance which is then read by dubbing actors and actresses. The goal is to provide a faithful, scripted summary of the original speech. It can be pre-recorded or performed live. The difference between narration and dubbing is that the text is being read, not performed. Narration is also similar to voice over, but is different in that the final product is more condensed and is not always completely faithful to the original's style.\n\nAlso known as \"sight translation\", simultaneous translation is done on the spot from a prepared script in the target language. It is different from interpretation in that \"it takes this second foreign language as a pivot language\". It is used when more elaborate methods of audiovisual translation are not an option, due to time or funding constraints. As a result, it is only used in film festivals and film archives.\n\nAlso known as \"real-time subtitling\", it differs from regular subtitling in that the subtitles are not prerecorded and are instead inserted on the spot. This mode of multimedia of translation is used for live broadcasts for those who are hard of hearing. A \"respeaker\" takes the original sound and dialogue of a live program or event and \"respeaks\" it into a speech recognition software. This new version includes punctuation marks and specific features for this audience, which is then turned into subtitles with as little delay as possible.\n\nSDH is meant for those who have difficulty hearing the dialogue on a film or television show by helping them to \"see\" the sound. Although similar to subtitling, SDH adds additional information to complement the verbal dimension. Originally, these subtitles were only available for films and pre-recorded broadcasts. However, the \"growing number of legislative and regulatory provisions has set minimum quota requirements\" for broadcasters and subtitling companies.\n\nAD is meant for those who are blind, visually-impaired or partially-sighted and assists by providing a narration concerning the visual aspects of a film or television show, for example. The AD track does not interfere with the original dialogue since it is inserted during silent parts. The reader, known as an \"audio describer\", makes sure to balance what is necessary to the plot while not overwhelming the audience with excessive information. These particular descriptions would be recorded, but they can also be done live, (though still prepared in advance) such as in theatres. This mode of multimedia translation has become important in \"ensuring the accessibility of audiovisual products to the visually impaired.\"\n\nAnimation involves translation as well as script writing. The translator takes silent images, such as cartoons, and creates a script from scratch. Although similar to free commentary, it is different in that there is no previous script written in animation.\n\nDouble versions are products that involve two or more languages in which each actor and actress plays their role in their own language. The final product is then dubbed and synchronised so that there is only one language.\n\nRemakes contextualise a film so that they are in accordance with the target audience and its culture. These translations focus on values and ideology, so the linguistic aspect of the product is less of a priority. This mode of multimedia translation is mostly used for European films remade for American audiences.\n\nSince the late 1990s, multimedia translation has found a role in education. B.A and M.A. classes on this subject have been established at several universities across Europe and the United States (Boston, Dallas, Forlì, Genova, Leeds, Londra, Pisa, Pittsburgh, Torino, Udine, Barcelona, Vigo, Winterthur).\n"}

It is primarily spoken in the town of Kaniguram in South Waziristan, Pakistan by the Burki people. It is also spoken by a small group of people in Baraki Barak in Logar, Afghanistan. The language belongs to the Indo-Iranian language group. The extremely small number of speakers makes Ormuri an endangered language that is considered to be in a \"threatened\" state.\n\nOrmuri is notable for its unusual sound inventory, which includes a voiceless alveolar trill that does not exist in the surrounding Pashto. Ormuri also has voiceless and voiced alveolo-palatal fricatives (the voiceless being contrastive with the more common voiceless palato-alveolar fricative), which also exist in the Waziristani dialect of Pashto, but could have been adopted from Ormuri due to its close proximity.\n\nOrmuri is classified under the Indo-European, Indo-Iranian, Iranian, Eastern Iranian, Southeastern Iranian, and Ormuri-Parachi language groups \n\nAccording to the Endangered Languages Project, the language of Ormuri is highly threatened. The language is used for face-to-face communication, however it is losing users.\n\nThe Ormuri language is used by the Ormur/Baraki tribe in parts of the Kaniguram Valley in Waziristan, Pakistan. The language is also used in a small part of Logar Province, Afghanistan. Zoroastrian Traces along the Upper Amu Darya (Oxus)]. D. A. Scott, \"The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland\", No. 2 (1984), pp. 217-228, Published by Cambridge University Press</ref>\n\nAn alternate name used by the Ormur people is Baraki. It is believed that there were eight to ten thousand families in the Logar area at the beginning of the 19th century and approximately four to five hundred families in Kaniguram at the beginning of the 20th century. The Ormur tribe does not occupy an ethnically homogeneous territory. In Afghanistan, the Ormur people live in mixed communities with both Tajiks and Pashtun. Whereas, in Pakistan, the Ormur people live only with the Pashtuns.\n\nEarly history of the tribe can be traced in Herodotus' book. The Persian Emperor Darius Hystaspes; Governor of Egypt conquered the Greek colonies of Barca and Cyrene in Libya and took them to Egypt on their return from expedition. At this time, the King returned from his Scythian campaign to his capital, Susa. The Barakis were given a village in Bactria to live in, later named Barke. After two thousand three hundred and fifty years, the village was still inhabited in 1891 within the same territory.\n\nThe name 'Ormur' (\"orməṛ\") is originally derived from Pashto (meaning \"fire\"). The first man to have made mention of the Baraki language was Babar, in his book \"Baburnama\". Ormuri, also called Birki at the time was one of the eleven to twelve tongues that were observed by Babar while in the region of Kabul. It is known that many of the Ormuri speakers are at least bilingual or trilingual, speaking other tribal languages such as Pashto, Persian, Dari, or Kaboli \n\nPir Roshan (Bayazid Khan) was one of the first known Pashto prose writers and composers of Pashto alphabets who used several Ormuri words in his book \"Khairul-Bayan.\" A few of the words that were used within his book were Nalattti (Pigs), Nmandzak of Mazdak (Mosque), Teshtan (Owner), Burghu (flout), Haramunai (ill-born), etc.\n\nOrmuri is spoken primarily in the town of Kaniguram in South Waziristan, Pakistan. A small population also speaks it in the town of Baraki Barak in Logar Province, Afghanistan. The language is sustained by nearly fifty adherents in Afghanistan and around five to six thousand speakers in Pakistan \n\nThere are two dialects of Ormuri; one is spoken in Kaniguram, Waziristan, which is the more archaic dialect, and the other one in Baraki-Barak, Logar. The Kaniguram dialect is not understood in Baraki-Barak. The linguist Georg Morgenstierne wrote: \n\nThe dialect of Kaniguram is currently strong, spoken by a relatively prosperous community of Ormur in an isolated part of the rugged Waziristan hills. However, the position of the dialect of Baraki Barak is not strong. Morgenstierne wrote he was told that:\n\nThe vowel system of Ormuri is characterized as heterogenous. The language consists of a subsystem of vowels that found native within Ormuri vocabulary, as well as a subsystem of vowels that is considered \"borrowed vocabulary.\" The differences seen between the Logar and Kaniguram dialects are mainly based on the quality of vowels instead of the quantity.\n\nThe system is based on six phonemes: i, e, a, å, o, u.\n\nThe consonant system varies slightly between both the dialects of Kaniguram and Logar. The Logar native consonant system contains 25 phonemes, while the Kaniguram system has 27.\n\nProper Ormuri words will have the following syllabic patterns: V, VC, CV, CCV, (C)VCC, CVC, CCVC, CCVCC. Both dialects from Kaniguram and Logar have similar syllabic structure.\n\n\nAt the end of certain words CC occurs as spirant/sonant + occlusive. When separating most words into syllables, a medial CC will be divided:\n\nThe language has undergone extensive change in comparison to its ancestral self. For nominal morphology (nouns, adjectives, and pronouns), aspects of the Kaniguram dialect of grammatical gender has completely been lost in the Logar. In terms of the verbal morphology, there is a greater variety of conjugations of modal and tense-aspect forms based on the present-tense stem. There is also a distinction made between masculine and feminine words based on the past-tense system. Finally, there is a greater number of distinctions between within the system of tense-aspect forms and there are different types of ergative constructions.\n\nThere is a developed system of noun and verb inflections. Nominal parts of speech contains: Three numbers (singular, dual, and plural), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and the verb has two vices (active and middle). There is the elimination of the category of case (loss in nouns, adjectives, numerals, and certain pronouns). There is also a complete loss of the category of gender, varying on the dialect (Complete loss in Logar and rudimentary masculine and feminine forms remain in Kaniguram). In Logar most original Ormuri nouns and adjectives have a simple stem ending in a consonant and a few nouns end in unstressed (or rarely stressed) -\"a\" or -\"i\". Whereas in Kaniguram, the stem usually ends in a consonant, but both nouns and adjectives may end in -\"a\" or -\"i\".\n\n\"Log.\" will represent examples from the Ormuri dialect of Logar and \"Kan.\" will be used to signify the Kaniguram dialect of Ormuri\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2094955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094955", "title": "Salience (language)", "text": "Salience (language)\n\nSalience is the state or condition of being prominent. The Oxford English Dictionary defines salience as \"most noticeable or important.\" The concept is discussed in communication, semiotics, linguistics, sociology, psychology, and political science. It has been studied with respect to interpersonal communication, persuasion, politics, and its influence on mass media.\n\nIn semiotics (the study of signs or symbolism), \"salience\" refers to the relative importance or prominence of a part of a sign. The salience of a particular sign when considered in the context of others helps an individual to quickly rank large amounts of information by importance and thus give attention to that which is the most important. This process keeps an individual from being overwhelmed with information overload.\n\nMeaning can be described as the \"system of mental representations of an object or phenomenon, its properties and associations with other objects and/or phenomena. In the consciousness of an individual, meaning is reflected in the form of sensory information, images and concepts.\" It is denotative or connotative, but the sign system for transmitting meanings can be uncertain in its operation or conditions may disrupt the communication and prevent accurate meanings from being decoded.\n\nFurther, meaning is socially constructed and dynamic as the culture evolves. That is problematic because an individual's frame of reference and experience may produce some divergence from some of the prevailing social norms. So the salience of data will be determined by both situational and emotional elements in a combination relatively unique to each individual. For example, a person with an interest in botany may allocate greater salience to visual data involving plants, and a person trained as an architect may scan buildings to identify features of interest. A person's world view or \"Weltanschauung\" may predispose salience to data matching those views. Because people live for many years, responses become conventional. At a group or community level, the conventional levels of significance or salience are slowly embedded in the sign systems and culture, and they cannot arbitrarily be changed.\nFor example, the first thing seen in a poster may be the title or picture of a face.\n\nThe noun “salience” derives from the Latin word \"saliens -\" ‘leaping, or bounding’. In a human embryo, the heart tissue is beating and leaping. A Native American may pay no attention to Columbus Day protests until after instruction in tribal and historical Indian traditions (priming). After gaining new cultural insights, these protests may become “salient.”\n\nSalience, as a component of Communication and Social Psychology studies, asks the question of why something captures and holds our attention and why it is more readily available as a cognition than other facts, feelings, and emotions? When a person perceives and reacts, they use the information and emotions most readily accessible. This information is understood to be the most salient information. \nSocial Influence is an area of intense study for Social Psychologists and Communication theorists. Social Influence asks how and why, are people influenced to weaken a strongly held position, adopt a new position, change an attitude, or persuade someone? The extent that the communicator can understand and harness the power of Social Influence is the extent that they can succeed in their goal.\n\nSalience has been identified as one of the key ideas that guides our understanding of how to make a point of view stand out from among others and draw the receivers attention to the salient points of the encoded message. Salience is then an important concept in several theories relating to Social Influence. Some areas of Communication and Social Psychology research that include the concept of salience as a component of their theory are: Persuasion Theory, Vested Interest, Summation Theory of Attitude Change, Group Salience, and Social Presence Theory. The use of salience in these theories is summarized below:\n\nPersuasion theory: Salience is the critical concept, along with agenda and spin, for the Persuasion theory of Professor Richard E. Vatz of Towson University as articulated in his book, /The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion/, (Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013). Salience, in his book and articles, is used as a measure of how reality is created for chosen audiences. He claims (1973) (2013) that the struggle for salience (and agenda and meaning and spin) is the sine qua non of the persuasive process.\n\nVested interest (communication theory): William Crano's states that, “Vested Interest refers to the extent to which an attitude object is hedonically relevant for the attitude holder” (Crano, 1995, p. 131). In order for someone to have a vested interest in something, it must be perceived to affect their lives personally. Things that in which we are highly vested also bear on our behavior (Crano, 1995), and it must be salient or leap out. Vivid cues are more likely to grab our attention (McArthur & Post, 1977). If an attitude object is salient to us, our vested interest will be increased as well as the likelihood that our behavior and attitudes will be consistent (Sears & Citrin, 1985).\n\nCrano states, “Apparently, making an attitude object more salient enhances the salience of attitude-relevant outcomes as well. Vividness, priming, and similar operations may all enhance the salience of the self-interest implications of a position.” (Crano, 1995, p. 131). The stronger the salience of our attitude, the stronger will be the connection between our attitude object and our behavior.\n\nAttitude Summation Theory: Fishbein posited that we have many beliefs about an attitude object (characteristics, attributes, values, and etc.). Each belief held is argued to have an affective (feeling) and evaluative (value determining) component. An attitude is then a mediated evaluative response (Fishbein, 1963). These attitudes sum together to form our overall view of the attitude object and comes to the forefront (made salient) when we engage the attitude object.\n\nFishbein indicates that we can hold six to nine salient beliefs at a time (Cronen, 1973). Those manifested during the attitude object encounter determine the prevailing attitude. Fishbein believed that the strongest held beliefs would be the most salient and come to the fore. Cronen argued that salience is not intrinsically tied to strength, but is an independent attribute of attitude change, as some strongly held beliefs are non-salient (Cronen, 1973).\n\nGroup Salience: Group salience is a person's cognizance of fellow group members similarities and differences within a group interaction (Harwood et al., 2006). Within a group, communication is the primary way that we determine salience of attitudes. Other things such as physical attributes can be observed, but deeper feelings will have to be communicated within the group to make them salient (Harwood et al., 2006). Coupland et al., suggest that communication processes represent an individual's identity within the group (Coupland et al., 1991).\n\nSocial presence theory (SPT): SPT can be defined as, “The degree to which a person is perceived to be a real person in mediated communication.” (Gunwadena, 1995) This is an update on the original definition, developed by Short, Williams and Christie (1976), which stated, “The degree of salience of the other person in an interaction.”\n\nWhat makes something salient? How does the mind select, structure and impart meaning to stimuli? People “develop and stabilize” cognitions about stimuli by an “examination of action, intention, ability and environment.” (Taylor & Fiske, 1978, citing Heider, 1934, as their source, p. 250). Individuals have limited cognitive resources and abilities to process and comprehend information and situational complexity. A person cannot grasp every nuance of a stimuli required to assign its full and complete meaning. Salience is the way researchers understand what information will most likely capture one's attention in a given situation and have the greatest influence on one's cognitions about the stimuli. Research has shown that the most salient information is not always the most accurate or important, but a “Top of the Head Phenomenon” (Taylor & Fiske, 1978). People are not fully conscious of the extent to which salience affects them. In experimental studies, individuals generated strong cognitions with only slight manipulation of stimuli. When shown this fact, the participant reacted strongly to the idea that they made choices based on “trivial” information (Taylor & Fiske, 1978).\n\n“Salience has generally been treated as a propriety [conforming to standard norms of morality and behavior] of a stimulus which allows it to stand out and be noticed” (Guido, 1998, p. 114). Guido developed the Theory of Dichotic Salience after a review of some 1,200 studies, which pointed to a “common origin among salience instances, by emphasizing the nature of prominence which is intrinsic to any salience construct” (Guido, 1998, Abstract, p. 114). According to this theory, a stimulus is “in-salient” if it is not in harmony with perceiver's worldview. It is “re-salient” if it is in harmony with the perceiver's goals (Guido, 1998).\n\nSalience is a construct that depends on the ability of the mind to access the feelings or emotions (affect) generated by the salient stimulus. The activation in memory of cognitions that relate to and evaluate the stimulus. And finally, the availability of these mental resources to engage the stimulus (Guido, 1998).\n\nA schema (psychology) is a cognitive framework or concept through which one organizes and interprets information. Schemas provide shortcuts in sorting and interpreting the enormous quantity of information generated in one's environment. The limitation of such a construct, is that it may cause one to exclude pertinent facts and feelings about a situation. Instead one may focus on only those that harmonize with one's biases, beliefs and ideations.\n\nSchemas are very useful as they help one to decide about things with very little information. This simplification filters how one allocates cognitive resources. It also allows one to learn more readily and rapidly, if the learning fits within an already established schema. A schema allows for quick access to stored cognitions and filtering through pre-established algorithms, which saves time in processing and retrieving information. Because they are so useful and reliable in helping one make sense of the world, schemas can be hard to change. Thomas Kuhn (1962), in his book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, talks about how scientists, considered the most rationale and fact driven professionals, can be so committed to their schemas that they ignore or misinterpret relevant data gathered from experiments that is contrary to their notions. One challenge for communicators is to find a way to break through these hardened perceptions in order to persuade. Making an idea salient is one of the keys.\n\nGuido's Principle one is figure-ground, which is the means the perceptual field from which people direct their attention towards something that stands out. Figurality is the brightness, complexity, and energy (movement) of a stimulus. It is thought that these aspects trigger cognitions and thought processes in the brain that lead to salience. Brightness includes the magnitude and the colors of the object. Studies have shown that bright, vibrant colors more easily capture the attention and are easier to remember (Guido, 1998).\nComplexity builds upon the contextual factors (the number of perceptible qualities about the stimulus object that one can distinguish) and learning (what we perceive as unfamiliar). Complexity is the interaction of the familiarity, unfamiliarity, and the number of aspects of the stimulus object that we can resolve. Complexity is the interaction of these stimuli interact to engage affect and cognitions developed about the object (Guido, 1998). Movement of an object engages sensory receptors, which when sparked, send stimuli to the body and brain. Moving pictures, signs and eyes are used to capture our attention and make us pay attention (Guido, 1998).\n\nNovelty is the “isolation” of the stimulus from other stimuli (objects). This isolation or uniqueness sets it apart from other objects in the background, so that it can be noticed (Guido, 1998). This can also be expressed as comparative distinctiveness (Higgins, 1996).\nGuido's Principle two is Unusuality, which can be broken down into statistical novelty (unique and unfamiliar), unexpectancy, out of role behaviors, negativity and extremity (emotional impact). Novelty is the degree that one has no experience with the stimuli. Unexpectancy is a result of learning. We have developed an expectation that is violated (Guido, 1998). Negativity is our gut reaction. Extremity is the emotional impact of the Negativity. Each of these contributes to making something salient.\n\nAccessibility and Salience. When we evaluate a situation, what comes first to our minds? The things that come to mind are those that are most accessible (most readily recalled and those that are most salient (Kreech and Crutchfield, 1948). Our beliefs and thoughts vary in salience. Salient beliefs are most easily activated in the cognitive processes and are more easily recalled, and are therefore more accessible (Higgins, 1996).\n\nSalience is determined by stimuli, such as brightness, contract, situational properties, schemas, expectations, arousal, and properties of the interpreter (e.g., need state, enduring beliefs, and motivations). The interconnectedness of these stimuli causes the brain to be activated and information salient to the situation recalled and acted upon.\n\nInformation stored in memory, that is accessible, can be recalled either by a cue or free association. Information that is not accessible, cannot be recalled and therefore is not available for use in interpreting a situation. Higgins (1996) defines a memory's activation potential as having three properties: 1. the possibility that the knowledge can be recalled (not repressed or lost), 2. how easily accessible is it, and 3.the intensity or the energy of the memory. To the extent that memories are available, accessible, and have sufficient effect is the extent that these memories will be activated and that knowledge is brought to bear on the situation at hand.\n\nCramer (1968, p. 82) defines priming as \"a change in antecedent conditions which is specifically designed to increase the probability of a particular response given to a particular stimulus\". The process of priming can activate a particular memory to bring it to the fore so that it can be engaged in a communication or social influence situation. Priming has been shown to increase accessibility of relevant knowledge (Higgins, 1996). Priming is, then, any event that causes increased accessibility and availability of a framework of knowledge (schema) useful for that particular situation.\n\nIn journalism, priming is associated with framing. When an author writes an article to persuade, he or she frames certain information so that it is more salient to the reader (Weaver, 2007). Framing including writing decisions about definitions of words and events, causal linkages, moral implications, and solution sets for the problem area (McCombs, 1997). Our minds sort information available using our agenda (framing) and stimulus (priming) for that situation and activate it to accomplish our purpose.\n\nWhen one encounters a stimulus for the first time, the initial reaction is characterized as unconditioned response. An unconditioned response is one that “elicits a national, reflexive response.” (Weseley & McEntarffer, 2014, p. 136). Subsequent encounters will elicit a conditioned response has been developed through the learning that occurred with the intervening encounters with the stimulus. This learning is bedrock knowledge on which one draws when responding to a given situation. (Weseley & McEntarffer, 2014). If the first time one ate ice cream the experience was pleasant, the second experience will be informed from the firs. The second experience will generate salient pleasant cognitions, salivation, and other biological responses that will reinforce the pleasant salience of the experience. If on the other hand, the first encounter was negative (disgust, pain or nausea), the second encounter will generate the feeling of pain in the stomach awful memories of the first encounter. which will reinforce the negative salience of the first and second experience.\n\nAnother key aspect of whether a particular memory or knowledge will be activated is whether it is applicable to the situation. If it is not applicable, it will not be salient and is unlikely to be activated for that situation. “According to the synapse model…, the process begins with the stimulus, which increases the excitation level of stored knowledge as a function of the features of the match between the attended features of the stimulus and the features of the stored knowledge.” (Higgins, 1996, p. 137). The stimulus information creates a pathway to the knowledge, which is then evaluated for a salience match to the stimulus. If there is a match, then the knowledge will be activated.\n\nOur minds and bodies are bombarded by relevant and irrelevant knowledge and experiences every day. We will tune into salient ones (crane the ears to more fully hear enjoyable music) and tune-out non-salient ones (cover our ears from jackhammer noise). There is difference between seeing something and looking at it. In seeing, the capacity of our retina to take in the light energy is engaged and the brain processes that information into an image. When one looks at an object, not only are visual perceptive capacities engaged, but other mental processes for evaluation and ordering of the object are activated (Skinner, 1974).\n\nHumans have gatekeeper mental mechanisms that allow certain information in and keeps others out. This discrimination process can be viewed a defensive mechanism the protects and enhances our life experience. Our processes of making cognitions “also involve contingencies of reinforcement.” (Skinner, 1974, p. 117). Skinner implies that reinforcement as “a special kind of stimulus control.” (Skinner, 1974, p. 119). Salience can be thought of as a reinforcement mechanism that make certain thoughts, feelings and emotions available, accessible, applicable and actionable within the context of the situation.\n\nEsber and Haselgrove (2011) looked at the use of predictiveness and uncertainty on stimulus salience. They cite the example of a bird watching the water for the presence of fish. Through learning, the bird associates the ripples with the closeness of the fish, but they must be careful of the uncertainty that ripple is not caused by a crocodile. The ripples are very salient, if they are caused by fish suitable for use as food. The likelihood increases that the ripples will catch the attention of the bird and improve its probability of eating the fish, if the ripple cue is a predictor of fish behavior and presence. The predictiveness of ripples reinforces its salience. The Esber–Haselgrove model argues that (1) “stimuli acquire added salience to the degree that they predict motivationally relevant consequences”, and (2) “a predictor of multiple reinforcers should have more salience than a predictor of just one.” (Esber & Haselgrove, 2011, 2555-25557). So, for example, if ripples predict both the presence of fish and the increased likelihood that the fish can be caught, they will be much more salient to the bird, than if the ripples only predict the presence of the fish, but tell the bird nothing about the probability of making a catch.\n\nSalience is a broad concept in the social sciences, that can cause confusion. Part of the confusion lies in that different researchers use the same term to posit different ideas of what makes a particular stimulus salient. When we encounter an object or idea, we may be draw to it for a variety of reasons. It may be its brightness or intensity, its predictive capacity, or other features such as uniqueness or enormity that catches one's attention.\n\nOnce the attention is engaged, our brain will begin to process this information and make assessments and judgements about the encounter. Our minds and bodies will activate useful memories, biological responses and feelings that were generated from prior encounters with the object of similar objects. These memory-evaluative-feeling-biology responses will determine if the object is salient. If it is salient, we will devote more cognitive processing resources to the encounter and it will enhance or protect us in that moment.\n\nCommunication scholars have found that a number of different factors have a direct effect on the salience of attitude objects.\n\nWilliam Crano posits that one's direct experience with an issue or attitude object increases the salience and consequently the potency of that attitude, and the level of consistency between attitude and behavior.\n\nThe concept called \"vested interest\" by Crano is called \"self-interest\" by Sears (1997). It seems that \"self-interest\" is the more widely recognized term. Self-interest involves either perceived or actual personal consequences. That is, Crano (1997) argues that vested interest involves perceived personal consequences (p. 490), while Sears (1997, a critique of Crano) counter-argues that Crano's survey experiments define it objectively. Crano argues that vested interest should have a moderating effect on attitudes. Sears argues that, actually, evidence for this is conflicting: The survey literature has rarely found significant effects of self-interest, while the experimental literature finds significant effects. The literature is concerned with salience only marginally; it is actually about strength of attitudes (i.e. how well they correlate with behavior). It is about salience inasmuch as anything \"strong\" is \"salient\".\n\nThe salience (prominence) of an attitude can also be measured by the relevance of an idea to that person's needs or aspirations. As ideals become more salient they become more accessible, the more accessible the attitude object is the stronger the attitude toward the object. As accessibility increases, so does the likelihood of self-interested voting (Young).\n\nPolitical scientists agree that salience is relatively important in examining political policy, because policies are not only determined by what issues are important to people but also by how important they are. This involves examining what issues are ignored and which are made \"important.\" One research agenda that political scientists are concerned with understanding is \"when and how salience and changes in salience matter for political action.\"\n\nThere are three related understandings of salience.\n\n\nMcCombs and Shaw’s seminal “Chapel Hill study”, which researched salience and public opinion examined most of the agenda-setting research since the United States presidential election, 1968 which has been concerned with how the public salience of the issue is related to mass media’s ranking of these issues in terms of frequency of coverage and news play. The main hypothesis examined in this study is the ranking of certain issues by the media, which, in time, becomes the public agenda. More importantly, the article searched whether the perceived public salience of the federal budget deficit is significantly related \"to the amount of public knowledge about the issue, direction of public opinion regarding one possible solution to the issue, the strength of that opinion and political behavior such as writing letters, signing petitions, voting, etc.\" The result of this study concluded that \"even though the federal deficit issue was one of the more salient to newspaper and voters during the 1988 election, it (the federal budget deficit) was not as emotional or dramatic as some of the other highly salient issues such as drug abuse or environmental pollution. Thus it seemed likely that public opinion regarding a solution to the federal budget deficit might be rather evenly split and would likely be more stable during the month of interviewing than would opinion on some of the other more dramatic issues being emphasized in news media coverage and political advertisements.\" In other words, issues that directly involve subjects, in this study, would conclude to be more salient than issues that do not involve them directly.\n\nAlthough salience is a stimulus response, is it a stimulus quality or an absolute quality? Salience plays an important role in intergroup communication. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, \"Group salience is a key variable both in influencing quality of intergroup contact and in moderating the effects of intergroup contact on prejudicial attitudes.\"\n\nIn their study of family communication and intergroup relationships, \"Group salience is an individual’s awareness of group memberships and respective group differences in an intergroup encounter (e.g., the salience of race in an interracial conversation).\" This study carefully examines the dynamics of intergroup relationships with respect to communication in a family context. Their study involved communicative aspects associated with age salience in the grandparent – grandchild relationship, the extent to which various dimension of communication predicts measures of salience, relational or inter-family proximity, and attitudes towards aging. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, \"Communication phenomena that were positively correlated with measures of age salience were negatively related to relational closeness. Only one communication measure (grandparents talking about the past) moderated the relationship between quality of contact with grandparent and attitudes toward older people. Specific communicative dimensions emerged that warrant further investigation in this and other intergroup contexts.\"\n\nSalience also from an applied communicative perspective plays an important role in our Consumer- Marketing world. In Gianluigi Guido's book, \"The Salience of Marketing Stimuli: an incongruity – salience hypothesis on consumer awareness\", \"salience triggered by an external physical stimuli, like all marketing stimuli are before being internalized by consumers – to explain and predict the conditions under which a marketing stimulus, is able to achieve its communication outcomes in term of processing and memory.\" The book clearly defines the history of the definition of salience and the ambiguities of arriving at an accurate definition. It also utilizes various theories to best define salience in our marketing world. Of the many theories, Guido uses aspects of Incongruity theory, Schema theory and an information processing model referred to as the In-salience hypothesis emphasizes the nature of prominence of salience.\n\nMarketing plans have become quite intricate and detailed in many ways. Analysts and industry experts used a myriad of tools to collect information from would be customers, previous customers and others in order to fashion the sales message of a particular product. This level of detailed work has evolved over time, but in many ways the same resources and information are gathered and used to achieve result of a sale. The marketing strategy feeds into one of the final products most people get to experience: the commercial. The commercial embodies the elements of the marketing strategy in language, affective response, and attitude change. Marketing plans in the modern age also look at the international customer when creating plans and formulating strategy. “An evolutionary perspective of internationalization of the firm has been adopted by a number of authors in the areas of international economics and international management. The theory of the international product lifecycle, propounded by Vernon and others, identifies a number of phases in the internationalization process based on the location of production. In the initial phase, a firm exports to overseas markets from a domestic production base. As market potential builds up, overseas production facilities are established. Low cost local competition then enters the market, and ultimately exports to the home market of the initial entrant, thus challenging its international market position.”\n\nThe field of marketing is continually being studied and researched. Anshular & Kumar, Williams & Schmidt, Holden, Kuznetsov & Whitelock, and Huang & Chan have researched and published works regarding the language of marketing. Although the research is ongoing and adaptive to the customer, the research has been able to study points of importance to the consumer. Marketing requires an approach that carefully designs messages (commercials), utilizing signs and symbols to resonate with a potential buyer or customer. Nike's swoosh, Michael Jordan's jump-man image, Ford/GMC Cadillac logos are all signs that most people can quickly grab and discern the message being laid out. In the world of marketing having this power and ability gives you a significant edge in comparison to the competition. Van Der Lans, Pieters, and Wedel write based on their research “we estimate brand salience at the point of purchase, based on perceptual features (color, luminance, edges) and how these are influenced by consumers’ search goals. We show that the salience of brands has a pervasive effect on search performance, and is determined by two key components: The bottom-up component is due to in-store activity and package design. The top-down component is due to out-of-store marketing activities such as advertising.” Using computer based langue to design extraction tools as part of the user experiences. Language errors that exists in projects can be passed on and further create issues for the next group. From this view issues to be fixed, ID’d and solutions set up to combat such issues. In the IT world, coding language is very important and therefore errors must be monitored well throughout the process.\n\nInternet Alcohol Vendors unlike traditional brick and mortar stores are established to reach a wider market. With this intent state officials and competitors have both started cases in court as further regulating the practice of internet alcohol sales. Internet sales give buyers reduced discounts in many forms while offering very little in security and accountability. The case brought against the industry favored further regulation keying in on individuals underage age having access to and buying alcohol online. The courts pushed back against the plaintiff lacking substantial information to make the case. The marketing language used was focused on reduced taxes based on quantity purchased and reduced or zero fees for shipping. Customers were connected to this message and therefore drawn to the product and made significant purchases.\n\nRussian viewpoint of marketing focused on the battle against capitalism, the west and specifically USA. Marketing language focused on the economics of each nation and how to improve it in an ever-changing world. Marketing was studied in the west by Russian students and translated for Russians to understand. Bad language came from translators who took artistic leisure with the material. Based on this context things were changed and missed when information was being relayed created huge shifts in understanding of the original material.\n\nThe difference between the English alphabet and Chinese logographical system offer a unique challenge in brand creation, marketing and language. The article touches on how unique messages have to be crafted without simply translating. The Chinese language and system of writing is over 35,000 years old and not as easily bent or flexed to make easily pronounced phrases both in sound and linguistic prowess. Marketing in china is affected my culture and language equally. Crafting an effective strategy requires adherence and understanding of all factors.\n\nTherefore, to define salience as appropriate as possible using the information, it would be apt to define it such that, salience is that intrinsic concept of the perceived or interpreted prominence of an attitude, and its manifestation on our choices.\n\nSalience in marketing based on the research reviewed, can be categorized as a stimulus quality. What that means is the customers’ needs have to be calculated and adjusted towards through the entire planning and execution of the plan. The overall goal of the messenger should be to create a message which adapts to the customer's affective responses, rewarding it with more info, then finally providing a product which would best arrive at the predetermined feel. Most consumers when asked about a marketing campaign are able to identify it clearly from the point of view of a commercial. These commercials capture the essence of the message being sent to all recipients. Products such as make up, cars, clothing, coffee, food, shoes etc. are all designed to create and provide an affective reaction from the recipient. The process of engaging with the customer seeks a cognitive connection. Customers will have to be grouped based on the item in order to predict affective responses. With this in mind, the focus is placed on imagery, affective responses from the consumer. How does this make you feel, do you empathize, how would you feel about using this product, etc. Marketing messages that have a significant affective component are able to connect better with people and yield greater outcome.\n\nIdentity salience can affect the consumer. This display can be explain using “Identity theory posits that identities are arranged hierarchically and that salient identities are more likely to affect behavior than those that are less important. We propose that identity salience may play an important role in relationships that are distinguished by a minimum of two characteristics. First, though most theoretical and empirical research in relation-ship marketing focuses on characteristics of successful business-to-business relationships, such as trust and commitment (Morgan and Hunt 1994), many exchange relationships involve individuals. It is not unusual for organizations to attempt to develop long-term relationships with consumers on an individual basis. We argue that in contexts in which one partner is an individual, for example, business-to consumer marketing, identity salience may be an important construct that mediates relationship-inducing factors, such as reciprocity and satisfaction, and relationship marketing success.\" Identity gets tied to brands, products and places for some people. There are generations of family sports team supporters, airline users, vacation goings and even restaurant patrons. These key items become a foundation block of self-identification and perception.\n\nThe vehicle industry uses certain symbols as part of its marketing campaign. Most of these are touched on from different manufacturers in their efforts to win over customers. These are also common messages points that are used to make the sale and acquire the vested interest of the customer. For e.g. comfort (leather seating), roominess (cabin space), reliability, safety, performance, on/off-road handling, award winner by category, insurance companies or other entity. The best part of all the campaign is the dealership experience. This experience is the affective piece of the process. The initial being cognitive and schema connection, followed by the affective which aims at nudging the customer towards affirming the purchase. Customer attitudes can be influenced by a myriad of variables, therefore the marketing campaign is aimed at skewing enough of those variables towards to nearest dealer or once most capable of making the sale. “Specifically, research on behavioral synchrony suggests that people express greater feelings of attraction when they share their visual gazes, body postures (Chartrand & Lakin,2013), and more recently, their language style in writing or speech (Ireland & Pennebaker,2010).\"\n\nSalience as a stimulus quality is a significant piece of the marketing, sales and commercial strategy. Manufacturers use celebrities, athletes, and other professionals as a way of drawing your attention to their product through stimulus. When it comes to car buying, many people refer to a past memory, this stimuli is different with each person but overall the quality and richness of that response is what connects to the brand in a way nothing else does. Care makers go through periods of recycling pieces of nostalgia to connect new drivers to those of yesteryear. Granpa is able to drive his mustang next to a grandson who favors the new model with a few modifications. A suit maker is able to dress members of the same family for 3 generations and just as many weddings and formal events.\n\nThe stimulus quality is the strongest connection between all these events and the company or product creator able to take advantage of this, is most likely to achieve success. “Research concerning stimulus characteristics, which include information content and format, suggests that consumers utilize more nutrition information when it Is presented in an easily processed form (Levy et al. 1985; Muller 1985; Russo et al. 1986; Scammon 1977).(Moorman, 1990)” Stimulus qualities continually change and therefore needs to be studied and adaptations made in order to attain the best marketing end results. Cultural viewpoints of marketing and advertising is important across industries in many parts of the world. In the US alcohol sales are restricted to individuals ages 21 and greater, that rule isn’t universal and some in nations around the world are trying to cope with the effects of marketing and ad campaigns (O’Brian & Carr 2016).” Marketing messages are important based on the roles of the recipient. In the example of a mom she’s expected to judge the quality of goods and purchase based on the needs of children even though the good may not directly be marketed to and for her. “Noting the incongruence between the self-interested, utility maximizing persona one is expected to portray in the workforce, and the selﬂess, nurturing persona widespread among mothers, Hays argues that the latter identity in fact reveals a deep-seated cultural ambivalence towards economistic principles and behaviours.”\n\nle form schema based on social norms and roles. These roles are enforced individual beliefs and boosts perceptions is supposed to be doing, sometimes those expectations hold true and in others it doesn’t. Social identity theory has been used while creating marketing strategies regarding women. Marketing strategies with products aimed at women should have like minds as part of the planning and creative process. Women across cultures and backgrounds experience similar stimuli but not on the same wave. Products like shoes, makeup, clothing and others geared specifically for women have messages focused on stimuli response of “feel good”. Moms receive and are sent messages of safety and security of their children, a measure of style and the look and presentation of a strong woman. Marketing towards men are designed to inspire the feel of strength, leadership, vision, connection to nature, and feeling of ruggedness.\n\nThe Language used in marketing is important because it is potentially the most important reason why someone makes a purchase/acquires a product. Research has shown that analytics aren’t always the best predictor of sales or consumer connection with a product. Social identity theory can be used to evaluate the roles of individuals while creating the strategy. Depending on this solely will lead one astray without the addition of other pieces of information. Shema allows the consumer to receive each detail of a commercial/ad campaign in a way that energizes particular stimuli and therefore puts each person into the “driver seat” of an experience.\n\nThe cognitive perspective spells out information which must be received, processed and analyzed and solutions south. Salience in marketing searches for the affective or stimulus response. A combination of efforts which both harvests information and processes it carefully if very important. Things such as age group, buying power, shopping frequency, socioeconomic status are all important. Once a product is created and during its testing phase the response which users and customers alike will be its feel. In the new age of tech data, appliances and complex machinery, marketing will still need to focus its efforts on such products and how consumer stimuli reacts to the product. The best engineers can create something that's amazing with all its bells and whistles, but its up to the perception of the customer to evaluate its usefulness and fit into his/her lifestyle.\n\nThe growing tech industry with the power of achievement is quickly advancing virtual reality. VR can be experienced in the home without leaving to try or test any product prior to purchase. \"The mural isn't just about aesthetics. Visitors will be instructed via signs to download an app to view the mural's augmented reality features. Downloading the app will also unlock a special coupon at The Elephant Room. It's a marketing tactic that Moody believes can drive foot traffic to the bar.\" With this power marketing analysts and executives can craft messages and commercial aimed at each person with a unique and authentic feel. Information and data points are being collected and tested now. Video games offer a chance into the virtual world medical training and some groups in government and the military are adopting the technology to better achieve results. Crafting the message and spreading it out the masses will take less effort in the future, messages can be adapted to fit all manner of permutations each person may have. There may finally be an era of error free messaging with a direct link into the internet, show rooms of fashion designers, engineers at car factories and all other sorts of products. Testing in the virtual world would be far less tasking on legions of people.\n\nHumans in general respond greatly to stimuli and we offer this through the reactions generated. Marketing lends help in this manner by studying the patterns of behavior and crafting products for sale. The messaging is not always clear, succinct, and wide reaching. Research is still ongoing regarding how best to reach the customer in order to pitch and complete a sale. Those who are successful have crafted tools to help measure key things like salience in messaging and reaction to products. In the new age, the data collected will be very important while outfitting each member of the consuming public. Being able to craft a message or medium that can quickly adapt to each person virtually is of great importance. Online markets are gaining followership daily as more money spending moves to the digital realm. Perception and reception of the message is still the single most important part of any marketing strategy and should not be treated lightly.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37722902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37722902", "title": "Service Rigs", "text": "Service Rigs\n\nA service rig is a mobile platform loaded with oil industry service equipment that can be driven long distances within the oil fields to service wells. Unlike drilling rigs, service rigs return to a particular well many times.\n\nThere are several specialized types of service rigs: the carrier, the pumptruck, the doghouse, a 5-ton equipment truck and several crew vehicles. The rigs usually travel in a convoy, because all of the component rigs are needed for proper oil well servicing. The crew use the equipment on the rigs to provide a variety of services, including completions, work-overs, abandonment's, well maintenance, high-pressure and critical sour-well work and re-entry preparation.\n\nOffshore oil rigs are serviced by floating versions of the same equipment.\n\nThe Rig, or Carrier, is a mobile truck with a derrick and a cab for one driver. The carrier can also be trailer-mounted, enabling it to be towed behind a prime mover. Traditionally, trailer-mounted service rigs are much larger and heavier, with greater capacities. Once secured on location, the derrick is elevated to standing position with the use of hydraulics. After that, the rest of the rig can be assembled and the service process initiated.\n\nThe Pumptruck has a large tank on the rear, and is used to pump fluid and store fluid from the well during different stages of the maintenance process. It is assembled using a series of pipes and operated with valves and pressure systems.\n\nThe Doghouse is a portable building used by the crew members to suit up, eat lunch, and assemble during meetings and breaks. It holds the communications and emergency equipment, a washroom, and has a storage space for inventory and tools. This space is referred to as the Light Plant, and in some occasion's a tool room, the Light Plant contains a diesel generator to provide electricity for lights and equipment.\n\nThe 5 Ton is a large truck which carries tools and other equipment, including the B.O.P.'s(blow-out preventer), tongs, a rod table, and extra pipe. It also pulls the doghouse from one location to the next.\n\nThe crew members on service rigs each have specialized experience and expertise. The entry-level workers are junior floor hands called roughnecks; they do most of the heavy work on the rig floor, as well as hauling pipe, maintaining equipment and cleaning up. Derrickhands are more experienced workers who assemble the pump truck, monitor circulations and handle pipe and rods on the elevated tubing board. The most experienced member of a service rig crew is the driller, who runs the control panel next to the rig floor, controls the height of the derrick, monitors the roughnecks and derrickhands, and sees that the job is done efficiently but safely.\n\nEach service rig has a manager called a Toolpush, who orders and monitors supplies, monitors and records the progress of each job and schedules the crew's time. At times there is also a representative present from the oil company whose wells are being serviced.\n\nService rig crew's are often under the supervision of a Consultant who is contracted through said oil company and reviews safety and job tasks with the crew, and organizes the process of moving from each well and ensuring the \ncompletion of the job.\n\nJobs on service rigs are often more stable than those on drilling rigs, because maintenance is an ongoing process.\n"}

The impetus for its development was that ABBYY LS had “felt constrained by translation technologies that had existed for the last 15 years” and wanted a solution that would let them “manage projects with dozens of collaborators, including project managers, translators, editors, and so on” while being “intuitive, cloud-based, scalable, and powerful.”\n\nIn 2016, Smartcat spun out of ABBYY LS to become a separate company and attracted $2.8 mln in investments from Ilya Shirokov (ex-CEO at Odnoklassniki and founder of Yandex-acquired social network MoiKrug.ru). ABBYY LS’s founder and CEO Ivan Smolnikov also left the company to fully focus on Smartcat. The main reasons for the separation were that the “translation automation business turned out far from being complementary to that of a language services provider” and that “some translation companies had been wary of using a service being developed by a competitor.”\n\nAs of July 2018, the platform has around 200,000 freelancers in its marketplace and provides an “app store” that allows integrating one’s Smartcat account with third-party tools.\n\nSmartcat has 3 general account types: Freelancer, Translation Company, and End Customer. The similarities and differences are highlighted below (all features are free unless otherwise noted):\nUnlike most CAT tools, Smartcat does not charge for user-based licenses, because it believes that “counting seats just doesn’t fit in the translation business, where more than 90% of the headcount in companies are freelancers and where new collaboration projects with a different number of them are set up on a daily basis.”\n\nInstead, Smartcat’s monetization is mostly based on the above-mentioned 10% commission charged on top of the rates of freelancers listed in and hired through its marketplace (which rates are decided upon and set by freelancers themselves) or, in case of hiring companies from the LSP marketplace, 10% of the order price. Apart from that, the company also offers paid subscriptions for premium support and standalone (non-Cloud) installations.\n\nIn 2017, the Smartcat has undergone a rebranding, adopting the tagline of “Connecting Purple” (a pun on Nokia’s “Connecting People”) and positioning itself as a “translation ecosystem that makes it easy for companies and talents to connect and collaborate” (emphasis by Smartcat). With the “ecosystem” approach, the company claims to underline that all of its users, whether customers or translators, are “equally important participants of the whole system, a system that can only thrive if all its members thrive.”\n\nSmartcat pays a great deal of attention to working with individual translators through various community initiatives such as a diversely developed community portal (under the tagline of “Let’s talk translation”), free courses and webinars for translators, and a peer review-based certification process to elect “Senior Translators”.\n\nSmartcat supports a variety of input formats, including text documents, presentations, spreadsheets, scanned documents and images (including a paid OCR service) , HTML pages, resource files, industry-standard bilingual formats, and others.\n\nThe company also claims to support SDL Trados packages, which allows using it as an environment to work on projects originally intended for SDL Trados, including generation of return packages to be further handled in Trados, although the degree of such support has been contested by SDL representatives.\n\nSmartcat offers several ways to learn its basics:\nFor more sophisticated questions, as well as bug reports, Smartcat provides a 24x7 support service accessible from within the app and via email, as well as community support on its community portal.\n\n\n"}

It is a coherent set of signs that transmits some kind of informative message. This set of symbols is considered in terms of the informative message's \"content\", rather than in terms of its physical form or the medium in which it is represented. \nWithin the field of literary criticism, \"text\" also refers to the original information content of a particular piece of writing; that is, the \"text\" of a work is that primal symbolic arrangement of letters as originally composed, apart from later alterations, deterioration, commentary, translations, paratext, etc. Therefore, when literary criticism is concerned with the determination of a \"text\", it is concerned with the distinguishing of the original information content from whatever has been added to or subtracted from that content as it appears in a given textual document (that is, a physical representation of text).\n\nSince the history of writing predates the concept of the \"text\", most texts were not written with this concept in mind. Most written works fall within a narrow range of the types described by text theory. The concept of \"text\" becomes relevant if and when a \"coherent written message is completed and needs to be referred to independently of the circumstances in which it was created.\"\n\nThe word text has its origins in Quintilian's book on speeches, with the statement that \"after you have chosen your\nwords, they must be weaved together into a fine and delicate fabric\", with the Latin for fabric being \"textum\".\n\nRelying on literary theory, the notion of text has been used to analyse contemporary work practices. For example, Christensen (2016) rely on the concept of text for the analysis of work practice at a hospital.\n\n\n"}

Until the early 20th century, various Western Armenian dialects were spoken in the Ottoman Empire, especially in the eastern regions historically populated by Armenians known as Western Armenia. Following the extermination of the Armenian population during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 Standard (literary) Western Armenian is now spoken, almost exclusively, in the Armenian diaspora communities around the world, while the spoken or dialectal varieties of Western Armenian currently in use include Homshetsi, spoken by the Hemshin peoples; the dialects of Armenians of Kessab (), Latakia and Jisr al-Shughur (Syria), Anjar, Lebanon, and Vakıflı, Samandağ (Turkey), part of the \"Sueidia\" dialect ().\n\nForms of the Karin dialect of Western Armenian are spoken by several hundred thousand people in Northern Armenia, mostly in Gyumri, Artik, Akhuryan, and around 130 villages in the Shirak province, and by Armenians in Samtskhe–Javakheti province of Georgia (Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe).\n\nNakhichevan-on-Don Armenians speak another Western Armenian variety based on the dialect of Armenians in Crimea, where they came from in order to establish the town and surrounding villages in 1779 ().\n\nWestern Armenian dialects are currently spoken also in Gavar (formerly Nor Bayazet and Kamo, on the west of Lake Sevan), Aparan, and Talin in Armenia (Mush dialect), and by the large Armenian population residing in Abkhazia, where they are considered to be the first or second ethnic minority, or even equal in number to the local Abkhaz population\n\nAs mostly a diasporic language, and as a language that is not an official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries. Estimates place the number of fluent speakers of Western Armenian outside Armenia and Georgia at less than one million.\n\nEastern Armenian and Western Armenian are, for the most part, mutually intelligible for educated or literate users of the other, while illiterate or semi literate users of lower registers of each one may have difficulty understanding the other variant. An example of differences in phonology, the \"b\" in Eastern Armenian is pronounced \"p\" in Western Armenian, similarly with \"g\" in Eastern Armenian that is pronounced \"k\" in Western Armenian. Same goes for \"d\" in Eastern Armenian that is pronounced \"t\" in Western Armenian and \"dj\" in Eastern Armenian that is pronounced \"tch\" in Western Armenian.\n\nWestern Armenian is an Indo-European language spoken by part of the population of Armenia in dialectal forms, Armenians of Abkhazia, most Armenians in Georgia, and the Armenian diaspora, mainly in North America and South America, Europe, Australia, most of the Middle East except for Iran, and Rostov-on-Don in Russia. It is spoken by only a small percentage of Armenians in Turkey as a first language, with 18 percent among the community in general and 8 percent among younger people. Western Armenian was at one point the dominant Armenian variety. After the genocide, Western Armenia was wiped clean of Western Armenians. Those who fled to Eastern Armenia today speak either Eastern Armenian, or have a diglossic situation between Western Armenian dialects in informal usage and an Eastern Armenian standard. The only Western Armenian dialect still spoken in Western Armenia is the Homshetsi dialect, as the people who speak it did not fall victim to the Armenian Genocide due to being Muslim.\n\nOn 21 February 2009 International Mother Language Day has been marked with the publication of a new edition of the \"Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger\" by UNESCO where the Western Armenian language in Turkey is defined as a definitely endangered language.\n\nWestern Armenian has eight monophthong vowel sounds.\n\nThe Western Armenian language has nine diphthong sounds.\n\nThis is the Western Armenian Consonantal System using letters from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), followed by the corresponding Armenian letter in brackets.\n\nThe differences in phonology between Western Armenian and Classical Armenian phonology include the distinction of stops and affricates.\n\nFirst, while Classical Armenian has a three-way distinction of stops and affricates: one voiced and two voiceless — a plain version and an aspirated one — Western Armenian has kept only a two-way distinction — one voiced and one aspirated. For example, Classical has three bilabial stops: , , and ; Western Armenian, two bilabial stops: and /.\n\nSecond, Western Armenian has shifted the Classical Armenian \"voiced\" stops and \"voiced\" affricates into \"aspirated\" stops and \"aspirated\" affricates, and replaced the \"plain\" stops and \"plain\" affricates with \"voiced\" ones.\n\nSpecifically, the following are the changes from Classical Armenian to Western Armenian:\n\nAs a result, a word like 'water' (spelled in Classical Armenian) is cognate with Western Armenian (also spelled ). However, 'grandson' and 'stone' are pronounced similarly in Classical and Western Armenian.\n\nWestern Armenian uses Classical Armenian orthography, also known as the traditional or Mashtotsian orthography. The Armenian orthography reform introduced in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and still used by most Eastern Armenian speakers from modern Armenia has not been adopted by Eastern Armenian speakers of Iran and their diaspora, and by Western Armenian, with the exception of periodical publications published in Romania and Bulgaria while under Communist regimes.\n\nWestern Armenian nouns have six grammatical cases: nominative (subject), accusative (direct object), genitive (possession), dative (indirect object), ablative (origin) and instrumental (means). Of the six cases, the nominative and accusative are the same, except for personal pronouns, and the genitive and dative are the same, meaning that nouns have four distinct forms for case. Nouns in Armenian also decline for number (singular and plural), but do not decline for gender (i.e. masculine or feminine).\n\nDeclension in Armenian is based on how the genitive is formed. There are several declensions, but one is dominant (the genitive in \"i\") while a half-dozen other forms are in gradual decline and are being replaced by the \"i\"-form, which has virtually attained the status of a regular form:\n\nLike English and some other languages, Armenian has definite and indefinite articles. The indefinite article in Western Armenian is , which follows the noun:\n\n\"mart mə\" ('a man', Nom.sg), \"martu mə\" ('of a man', Gen.sg)\n\nThe definite article is a suffix attached to the noun, and is one of two forms, either -n (when the final sound is a vowel) or -ə (when the final sound is a consonant). When the word is followed by al (ալ = also, too), the conjunction u (ու), or the present or imperfect conjugated forms of the verb em (to be); however, it will always take -n:\n\nbut:\n\nThe indefinite article becomes mən when it is followed by al (ալ = also, too) or the Present or imperfect conjugated forms of the verb em (to be):\n\nbut:\n\nAdjectives in Armenian do not decline for case or number, and precede the noun:\n\nVerbs in Armenian are based on two basic series of forms, a \"present\" form and an \"imperfect\" form. From this, all other tenses and moods are formed with various particles and constructions. There is a third form, the preterite, which in Armenian is a tense in its own right, and takes no other particles or constructions.\n\nThe \"present\" tense in Western Armenian is based on three conjugations (a, e, i):\n\nThe present tense (as we know it in English) is made by adding the particle gə before the \"present\" form, except the defective verbs \"em\" (I am), \"gam\" (I exist, I'm there), \"unim\" (I have), \"kidem\" (I know) and \"gərnam\" (I can), while the future is made by adding bidi:\n\nFor the exceptions: bidi əllam, unenam, kidnam, garenam (I shall be, have, know, be able).\nIn vernacular language, the particle \"gor\" is added after the verb to indicate present progressive tense. The distinction is not made in literary Armenian.\n\nThe verb without any particles constitutes the subjunctive mood, such as \"if I eat, should I eat, that I eat, I wish I eat\":\n\n\n\nWestern Armenian Online Dictionaries\n"}
{"id": "13922935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13922935", "title": "Yao language", "text": "Yao language\n\nYao is a Bantu language in Africa with approximately two million speakers in Malawi, and half a million each in Tanzania and Mozambique. There are also some speakers in Zambia. In Malawi, the main dialect is Mangochi, mostly spoken around Lake Malawi. In Mozambique, the main dialects are Makale and Massaninga. The language has also gone by several other names in English, including chiYao or ciYao (the prefixed form), Achawa, Adsawa, Adsoa, Ajawa, Ayawa, Ayo, Ayao, Djao, Haiao, Hiao, Hyao, Jao, Veiao, and waJao.\n\nIn Malawi, most Yao speakers live in the Southern Region near the southeast tip of Lake Malawi and bordering Mozambique to the east. In Mozambique most speakers live in Niassa Province from the eastern shore of Lake Malawi (Lago Niassa) to the Lugenda River up to where it meets the Rovuma River. In Tanzania most speakers live in the south central, Mtwara Region, Masasi district and in the Ruvuma Region, Tunduru district, east of Lake Malawi along the Mozambican border.\n\nIn common with very many vernacular languages in Africa, it has historically enjoyed little official recognition, and literary work in the region where Yao is spoken has taken place in such languages as Arabic, English, German and Portuguese.\n\nAs in English, unvoiced plosives are breathed and voiced plosives are not. There are conventionally only five 'pure' vowels, viz. a, e, i, o, u, though there is some variation in vowel length. Yao is minimally tonal language, as is common in Bantu languages.\n\nIn each of the main three countries where Yao is spoken, the orthography differs widely, and there is a low literacy rate. In Tanzania, the orthography is based on that of Swahili, whereas in Malawi it is based on that of Chewa. The Malawian form uses the following characters:\n\nMacrons can be used to prevent ambiguity that would otherwise arise due to the lack of representation of vowel length.\n\nYao is an SVO language. Like all Bantu languages, Yao is agglutinative, with a highly regular paradigm of verbal inflection, and its nouns placed in a variety of classes indicated by prefixes, these partially corresponding to actual categories of objects or people. To each class is associated a \"characteristic\", used in the formation of pronouns and \"concord links\", prefixes used before verbs governed by, and adjectives describing, a noun of the given class.\n\nThe corresponding concord links are identical to the nominal prefixes except in the cases of classes 1 and 2, which have concord links 'mb-' and 'a-' respectively. The convention of including classes 15b, 16 and 17 deviates from the traditional Bantu system, their prefixes being more properly prepositional or case determiners.\n\nThe personal forms are given below, with informal forms given in brackets.\n\nThere are affirmative and negative forms of the verb, each with approximately the following divisions:\n\nAs in many Bantu languages, this is characterised by an ending 'a'. Present, immediate future, present perfect, past and past perfect tenses are distinguished, the last being irregular in formation.\n\nThe subjunctive mood is similar in form to the indicative, but as in many Bantu languages, the final 'a' is changed to 'e'. It can be used as a polite imperative, and is usually associated with subordinate clauses.\n\nTo form the 'ordinary' (often less polite) imperative, the simple stem may be used, or 'n' may be prefixed to the indicative, or the continuative suffixes '-ga' or '-je' may be added.\n\nThe personal pronouns relate only to classes 1 and 2. Other pronouns are formed from the class links. These pronouns, as a common Bantu feature, are absolute, in that they stand alone from the rest of the sentence: for nominative accusative and prepositional forms, affixes must be used. The third person pronouns depend on noun class, as explained above.\n\nThese forms may be combined according to certain normal Bantu laws of vowel elision with prefixes such as 'na' (with, and).\n\nThere are also several demonstratives, most of which form triples ('this one', 'that one nearby', and 'that one far away')- that is, triple deixis is used.\n\n\n"}
