In 1869, a three-year-old Olsson and her parents emigrated from Värmland, Sweden. They settled in Lindsborg, Kansas, where Olof Olsson served as pastor. She would later use many experiences from her childhood on the prairie in her publications. Olsson's father accepted a professorship at Augustana College and Theological Seminary in 1876, and the family moved to Rock Island, Illinois. Olsson returned to Lindsborg in order to attend Bethany Academy in 1882 and 1883.\n\nIn the fall of 1883, Olsson reunited with her family in Rock Island and enrolled at Augustana College. She studied German language and literature, and was interested in philosophy. She earned her B.A. in 1888, and was only the second women to graduate from the college. Olof Olsson and his children traveled abroad in Europe from 1889 to 1890. They spent time in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. During this trip, Olsson continued her education in a German school and attended literature and philosophy lectures at the University of Zurich. From 1896 to 1898, she studied Italian, French, and literature at Augustana College.\n\nIn March 1887, a year before Olsson graduated from Augustana College, her mother, Anna Lisa, died. Because of this loss, Olsson had to take on many of her mother's duties as a pastor's wife. She also looked after her younger siblings and maintained the household. It was only after her siblings were older and her father had died that she was able to focus on her career as a writer.\n\nAnna Olsson split her career between teaching and writing. She returned to Lindsborg, Kansas in 1888 to teach in the Children's Department at Bethany Academy. She left that position to travel Europe with her family. In 1895, Olsson accepted a position as the principal of Ladies' Hall at Augustana College. She served as principal until 1900, when she became an instructor of English at the college. Her first work, a story printed anonymously in \"Ungdomsvännen\", was published in 1901 while she was still teaching. Olsson left her position at Augustana College in 1902.\n\nOlsson wrote both fiction and non-fiction in Swedish and English, and often used a Swedish-American dialect in her texts. Her publications, written using the pen name Aina, were mostly aimed at children. According to a report prepared in order to designate her home as a historic landmark, Olsson was \"as well known as Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe for her children's books.\" \"En prärieunges funderingar\", the book she is best known for, is a semi-autobiographical work about her family's immigration to the United States, their years in Kansas, and her school days at Augustana College. Olsson was also a popular contributor to Swedish and Lutheran periodicals, publishing her work in \"Ungdomsvännen\", \"Fosterlandel\", \"Prairieblomman\", \"Julrunan\", and \"Julgranan\", among others.\n\nOlsson continued to write until her death at the age of 79 on February 15, 1946. She and her siblings never married or had children. The home they lived in after their father's death was designated as a Rock Island landmark in 1996.\n\n\nLater editions\n\nOlsson's works were republished several times in Sweden and the United States. \"Prärieungen: Anna Olssons barndomsminnen\", an abbreviated version of \"En prärieunges funderingar\", was published by Joan Sandin in 1984 (Stockholm: Rabén & Sjögren, ). Martha Winblad and Elizabeth Jaderborg also translated and edited \"En prärieunges funderingar\" as \"A child of the prairie\" in 1978 (Lindsborg: Jaderborg).\n\n"}

A boss typically has absolute or nearly absolute control over their subordinates, is greatly feared by their subordinates for their ruthlessness and willingness to take lives to exert their influence, and profits from the criminal endeavors in which their organization engages.\n\nSome groups may only have as little as two ranks (a boss and his soldiers). Other groups have a more complex, structured organization with many ranks, and structure may vary with cultural background. Organized crime enterprises originating in Sicily differ in structure from those in mainland Italy. American groups may be structured differently from their European counterparts, and Latino and African American gangs often have structures that vary from European gangs. The size of the criminal organization is also important, as regional or national gangs have much more complex hierarchies.\n\nThe boss in the Sicilian and American Mafia is the head of the crime family and the top decision maker. Only the boss, underboss or consigliere can initiate an associate into the family, allowing them to become a made man. The boss can promote or demote family members at will, and has the sole power to sanction murders inside and outside the family. If the boss is incarcerated or incapacitated he places an \"acting boss\" who responsible for running the crime family. When a boss dies the crime family members choose a new boss from inside the organisation.\n\nThe typical structure within the Mafia in Sicily and America is usually as follows:\n\nA boss will typically put up layers of insulation between himself and his men to defeat law enforcement efforts to arrest him. Whenever he issues orders, he does so either to his underboss, consigliere or capos. The orders are then passed down the line to the soldiers. This makes it difficult under most circumstances to directly implicate a boss in a crime, since he almost never directly gives orders to the soldiers.\n\nThe term Mr Big is used within the underworld, and additionally during media reportings of persons associated with criminal activities, to refer to a leader of a body of persons functioning in the capacities of roles within organised crime. Sometimes bosses of the so-called gangland are referred to as being \"Mr Big\", as for example in the case of a report of the attempted assassination of an apparent leader of the Irish Republican Army, a person named Alan Ryan. The term implicitly indicates a degree of a possession of a higher intelligence of an individual.\n\nThe term especially indicates the existence of involvement in what is known as \"big-time crime\", which would include for example armed robbery, and the more organised aspects of careers within crime.\n\nIn the vernacular of underworld lexiconography within the 1940s of the United States of America, one source does not include the term as a known slang term, but does list \"Big Brains\", as referring to a gang leader.\n\nCrime lords are highly popular key figures in the popular culture world.\n\n"}

{"id": "8006328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8006328", "title": "Chinese speech synthesis", "text": "Chinese speech synthesis\n\nChinese speech synthesis is the application of speech synthesis to the Chinese language (usually Standard Chinese). It poses additional difficulties due to the Chinese characters (which frequently have different pronunciations in different contexts), the complex prosody, which is essential to convey the meaning of words, and sometimes the difficulty in obtaining agreement among native speakers concerning what the correct pronunciation is of certain phonemes.\n\nRecordings can be concatenated in any desired combination, but the joins sound forced (as is usual for simple concatenation-based speech synthesis) and this can severely affect prosody; these synthesizers are also inflexible in terms of speed and expression. However, because these synthesizers do not rely on a corpus, there is no noticeable degradation in performance when they are given more unusual or awkward phrases.\n\nEkho is an open source TTS which simply concatenates sampled syllables. It currently supports Cantonese, Mandarin, and experimentally Korean. Some of the Mandarin syllables have been pitched-normalised in Praat. A modified version of these is used in Gradint's \"synthesis from partials\".\n\ncjkware.com used to ship a product called KeyTip Putonghua Reader which worked similarly; it contained 120 Megabytes of sound recordings (GSM-compressed to 40 Megabytes in the evaluation version), comprising 10,000 multi-syllable dictionary words plus single-syllable recordings in 6 different prosodies (4 tones, neutral tone, and an extra third-tone recording for use at the end of a phrase).\n\nThe lightweight open-source speech project eSpeak, which has its own approach to synthesis, has experimented with Mandarin and Cantonese. eSpeak was used by Google Translate from May 2010 until December 2010.\n\nThe commercial product \"Yuet\" is also lightweight (it is intended to be suitable for resource-constrained environments like embedded systems); it was written from scratch in ANSI C starting from 2013. Yuet claims a built-in NLP model that does not require a separate dictionary; the speech synthesised by the engine claims clear word boundaries and emphasis on appropriate words. Communication with its author is required to obtain a copy.\n\nBoth eSpeak and Yuet can synthesis speech for Cantonese and Mandarin from the same input text, and can output the corresponding romanisation (for Cantonese, Yuet uses Yale and eSpeak uses Jyutping; both use Pinyin for Mandarin). eSpeak does not concern itself with word boundaries when these don't change the question of which syllable should be spoken.\n\nA \"corpus-based\" approach can sound very natural in most cases but can err in dealing with unusual phrases if they can't be matched with the corpus. The synthesiser engine is typically very large (hundreds or even thousands of megabytes) due to the size of the corpus.\n\nAnhui USTC iFlyTek Co., Ltd (iFlyTek) published a W3C paper in which they adapted Speech Synthesis Markup Language to produce a mark-up language called Chinese Speech Synthesis Markup Language (CSSML) which can include additional markup to clarify the pronunciation of characters and to add some prosody information. The amount of data involved is not disclosed by iFlyTek but can be seen from the commercial products that iFlyTek have licensed their technology to; for example, Bider's SpeechPlus is a 1.3 Gigabyte download, 1.2 Gigabytes of which is used for the highly compressed data for a single Chinese voice. iFlyTek's synthesiser can also synthesise mixed Chinese and English text with the same voice (e.g. Chinese sentences containing some English words); they claim their English synthesis to be \"average\".\n\nThe iFlyTek corpus appears to be heavily dependent on Chinese characters, and it is not possible to synthesize from pinyin alone. It is sometimes possible by means of CSSML to add pinyin to the characters to disambiguate between multiple possible pronunciations, but this does not always work.\n\nThere is an online interactive demonstration for NeoSpeech speech synthesis, which accepts Chinese characters and also pinyin if it's enclosed in their proprietary \"VTML\" markup.\n\nMac OS had Chinese speech synthesizers available up to version 9. This was removed in 10.0 and reinstated in 10.7 (Lion).\n\nA corpus-based approach was taken by Tsinghua University in SinoSonic, with the Harbin dialect voice data taking 800 Megabytes. This was planned to be offered as a download but the link was never activated. Nowadays, references to it can be found only on Internet Archive.\n\nBell Labs' approach, which was demonstrated online in 1997 but subsequently removed, was described in a monograph \"Multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis: The Bell Labs Approach\" (Springer, October 31, 1997, ), and the former employee who was responsible for the project, Chilin Shih (who subsequently worked at the University of Illinois) put some notes about her methods on her website.\n"}
{"id": "75807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75807", "title": "Contradiction", "text": "Contradiction\n\nIn classical logic, a contradiction consists of a logical incompatibility between two or more propositions. It occurs when the propositions, taken together, yield two conclusions which form the logical, usually opposite inversions of each other. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, Aristotle's law of noncontradiction states that \"One cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time.\"\n\nBy creation of a paradox, Plato's \"Euthydemus\" dialogue demonstrates the need for the notion of \"contradiction\". In the ensuing dialogue Dionysodorus denies the existence of \"contradiction\", all the while that Socrates is contradicting him:\nIndeed, Dionysodorus agrees that \"there is no such thing as false opinion ... there is no such thing as ignorance\" and demands of Socrates to \"Refute me.\" Socrates responds \"But how can I refute you, if, as you say, to tell a falsehood is impossible?\".\n\nIn classical logic, particularly in propositional and first-order logic, a proposition formula_4 is a contradiction if and only if formula_5. Since for contradictory formula_4 it is true that formula_7 for all formula_8 (because formula_9), one may prove any proposition from a set of axioms which contains contradictions. This is called the \"principle of explosion\" or \"ex falso quodlibet\" (\"from falsity, whatever you like\").\n\nIn a complete logic, a formula is contradictory if and only if it is unsatisfiable.\n\nFor a proposition formula_4 it is true that formula_11, i. e. that formula_4 is a tautology, i. e. that it is always true, if and only if formula_13, i. e. if the negation of formula_4 is a contradiction. Therefore, a proof that formula_13 also proves that formula_4 is true. The use of this fact constitutes the technique of the proof by contradiction, which mathematicians use extensively. This applies only in a logic using the excluded middle formula_17 as an axiom.\n\nIn mathematics, the symbol used to represent a contradiction within a proof varies. Some symbols that may be used to represent a contradiction include ↯, Opq, formula_18, ⊥, ↮, and ※; in any symbolism, a contradiction may be substituted for the truth value \"false\", as symbolized, for instance, by \"0\". It is not uncommon to see Q.E.D. or some variant immediately after a contradiction symbol; this occurs in a proof by contradiction, to indicate that the original assumption was false and that its negation must therefore be true.\n\nA consistency proof requires (i) an axiomatic system (ii) a demonstration that it is not the case that both the formula \"p\" and its negation \"~p\" can be derived in the system. But by whatever method one goes about it, all consistency proofs would \"seem\" to necessitate the primitive notion of \"contradiction\"; moreover, it \"seems\" as if this notion would simultaneously have to be \"outside\" the formal system in the definition of tautology.\n\nWhen Emil Post, in his 1921 \"Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions\", extended his proof of the consistency of the propositional calculus (i.e. the logic) beyond that of \"Principia Mathematica\" (PM) he observed that with respect to a \"generalized\" set of postulates (i.e. axioms) he would no longer be able to automatically invoke the notion of \"contradiction\" – such a notion might not be contained in the postulates:\n\nPost's solution to the problem is described in the demonstration \"An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency\" offered by Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman in their 1958 \"Gödel's Proof\". They too observe a problem with respect to the notion of \"contradiction\" with its usual \"truth values\" of \"truth\" and \"falsity\". They observe that:\n\nGiven some \"primitive formulas\" such as PM's primitives S V S [inclusive OR], ~S (negation) one is forced to define the axioms in terms of these primitive notions. In a thorough manner Post demonstrates in PM, and defines (as do Nagel and Newman, see below), that the property of \"tautologous\" – as yet to be defined – is \"inherited\": if one begins with a set of tautologous axioms (postulates) and a deduction system that contains substitution and modus ponens then a \"consistent\" system will yield only tautologous formulas.\n\nSo what will be the definition of \"tautologous\"?\n\nNagel and Newman create two mutually exclusive and exhaustive classes K and K into which fall (the outcome of) the axioms when their variables e.g. S and S are assigned from these classes. This also applies to the primitive formulas. For example: \"A formula having the form S V S is placed into class K if both S and S are in K; otherwise it is placed in K\", and \"A formula having the form ~S is placed in K, if S is in K; otherwise it is placed in K\".\n\nNagel and Newman can now define the notion of \"tautologous\": \"a formula is a tautology if, and only if, it falls in the class K no matter in which of the two classes its elements are placed\". Now the property of \"being tautologous\" is described without reference to a model or an interpretation.\n\nPost observed that, if the system were inconsistent, a deduction in it (that is, the last formula in a sequence of formulas derived from the tautologies) could ultimately yield S itself. As an assignment to variable S can come from either class K or K, the deduction violates the inheritance characteristic of tautology, i.e. the derivation must yield an (evaluation of a formula) that will fall into class K. From this, Post was able to derive the following definition of inconsistency \"without the use of the notion of contradiction\":\n\nIn other words, the notion of \"contradiction\" can be dispensed when constructing a proof of consistency; what replaces it is the notion of \"mutually exclusive and exhaustive\" classes. An axiomatic system need not include the notion of \"contradiction\".\n\nAdherents of the epistemological theory of coherentism typically claim that as a necessary condition of the justification of a belief, that belief must form a part of a logically non-contradictory system of beliefs. Some dialetheists, including Graham Priest, have argued that coherence may not require consistency.\n\nA pragmatic contradiction occurs when the very statement of the argument contradicts the claims it purports. An inconsistency arises, in this case, because the act of utterance, rather than the content of what is said, undermines its conclusion.\n\nIn dialectical materialism: Contradiction—as derived from Hegelianism—usually refers to an opposition inherently existing within one realm, one unified force or object. This contradiction, as opposed to metaphysical thinking, is not an objectively impossible thing, because these contradicting forces exist in objective reality, not cancelling each other out, but actually defining each other's existence. According to Marxist theory, such a contradiction can be found, for example, in the fact that:<br>\nHegelian and Marxist theory stipulates that the dialectic nature of history will lead to the sublation, or synthesis, of its contradictions. Marx therefore postulated that history would logically make capitalism evolve into a socialist society where the means of production would equally serve the exploited and suffering class of society, thus resolving the prior contradiction between (a) and (b).\n\nMao Zedong's philosophical essay \"On Contradiction\" (1937) furthered Marx and Lenin's thesis and suggested that all existence is the result of contradiction.\n\nColloquial usage can label actions or statements as contradicting each other when due (or perceived as due) to presuppositions which are contradictory in the logical sense.\n\nProof by contradiction is used in mathematics to construct proofs.\n\nThe scientific method uses contradiction to falsify bad theory.\n\n\n\n"}

In contrast to the king and his druids, he is said to have readily accepted the new religion. This event has played a major part in Hiberno-Latin and Irish sources as representing the integration of native Irish learning with the Christian faith.\n\nKing Lóegaire, jealous of the St. Patrick's power, had given orders that when he presented himself next at Tara no one should rise from his seat to do him honour. The next day was Easter day, and it was also a great feast with Lóegaire and his court. In the midst of their festivity, \"the doors being shut as in our Lord's case, St. Patrick with five of his companions appeared among them. None rose up at his approach but Dubthach, who had with him a youthful poet named Fiacc, afterwards a bishop. The saint upon this bestowed his blessing on Dubthach, who was the first to believe in God on that day. The \"Tripartite life of St. Patrick\" states that Dubthach was then baptised and confirmed, and Jocelyn adds that thenceforward he dedicated to God the poetic gifts he formerly employed in the praise of false gods.\n\nWhen he had been some time engaged in preaching the gospel in Leinster, St. Patrick paid him a visit. Their meeting took place at Domnach-már-Criathar, now Donaghmore, near Gorey, county Wexford, and St. Patrick inquired whether he had among his \"disciples\" any one who was \"the material of a bishop, whose qualifications are enumerated in the \"Book of Armagh\"\". Dubthach replied he knew not any of his people save Fiacc the Fair. At this moment Fiacc was seen approaching. Anticipating his unwillingness to accept the office, St. Patrick and Dubthach resorted to a stratagem. The saint affected to be about to tonsure Dubthach himself, but Fiacc coming forward begged that he might be accepted in his place, and he was accordingly tonsured and baptised, and \"the degree of a bishop conferred on him\".\n\nEdward O'Reilly, in his \"Irish Writers\", erroneously ascribes to Dubthach \"an elegant hymn … preserved in the calendar of Oengus\". One of the manuscripts of that work is indeed in the handwriting of a scribe named Dubthach, but he was quite a different person from Maccu Lugir. Another poem beginning \"Tara the house in which lived the son of Conn\", found in the \"Book of Rights\", and also assigned to him by O'Reilly, is there said to be the composition of Benen or Benignus. But there is a poem in the \"Book of Rights\" which is assigned to him by name. It relates to \"the qualifications of the truly learned poet\", and consists of thirty-two lines beginning \"No one is entitled to visitation or sale of his poems\".\n\nThere are also three other poems of his preserved in the \"Book of Leinster\". These have been published with a translation by O'Curry in his \"Manuscript Materials of Irish History\". They relate to the wars and triumphs of Enna Cennselach and his son Crimthann, both kings of Leinster. That these poems were written after his conversion to Christianity appears from the following: \"It was by me an oratory was first built and a stone cross\". The passage of greatest interest in these poems is that in which he says: \"It was I that gave judgment between Lóegaire and Patrick\". The gloss on this explains: \"It was upon Nuadu Derg, the son of Niall [brother of Lóegaire], who killed Odhran, Patrick's charioteer, this judgment was given\".\n\nThe story is told in the introduction to the \"Senchus Mor\", By order of Lóegaire, Odhran, one of St. Patrick's followers, was killed by Nuadu in order to try whether the saint would carry out his own teaching of forgiveness of injuries. St. Patrick appealing for redress was permitted to choose a judge, and selected Dubthach, who found himself in a difficult position as a Christian administering a pagan law. \"Patrick then (quoting St. Matthew 10:20) blessed his mouth and the grace of the Holy Ghost alighted on his utterance\", and he pronounced, in a short poem which is preserved in the \"Senchus Mor\", the decision that \"Nuadu should be put to death for his crime, but his soul should be pardoned and sent to heaven\". This (it is stated) was \"a middle course between forgiveness and retaliation\". After this sentence \"Patrick requested the men of Ireland\" to come to one place to hold a conference with him. The result was the appointment of a committee of nine to revise the laws. It was composed of three kings, three bishops, and three professors of literature, poetry, and law. Chief among the latter was Dubthach.\n\nIt became his duty to give an historical retrospect, and in doing so Dubthach exhibited \"all the judgments of true nature which the Holy Ghost had spoken from the first occupation of this island down to the reception of the faith. What did not clash with the word of God in the written law and in the New Testament and with the consciences of believers was confirmed in the laws of the brehons by Patrick and by the ecclesiastics and chieftains of Ireland. This is the \"Senchus Mor\".\" It was completed 441 AD, and is supposed to have been suggested by the revision of the Roman laws by Theodosius the younger. It was put into metrical form by Dubthach as an aid to memory, and accordingly the older parts appear to be in a rude metre. The work was known by various names, \"The Law of Patrick\", \"Noifis\", or \"The Knowledge of Nine\", but more generally as the \"Senchus Mor\".\n\nDubhtach is placed by hagiography with his nephew, Saint Fiacc of Sletty, and the jurist, Erc, at the court of Loegaire when Patrick visited Tara. O'Reilly's account states-\n\nWhen St. Patrick had come to Tara and was preaching before King Loegaire, we are told that the only one who rose on the saint's approach and respectfully saluted him was Dubhthach, the king's poet, who was the first to embrace the Christian faith in that place; and as Joceline says, \"being baptized and confirmed in the faith, he turned his poetry, which in the flower and prime of his studies he employed in praise of false gods, to a much better use; changing his mind and style, he composed more elegant poems in praise of the Almighty Creator and His holy preachers.\"\nThe descendants of Dubhtach and Fiacc, who the tale says were converted, were blessed by this demonstration of respect. He is at a later date given to have been present on the occasion Patrick made Fiacc a bishop.\n\nDubhthach gave a judgement against King Loegaire for killing Patrick's charioteer, Saint Odran. A result of this was the revision of the laws of the pagan Irish to bring them in line with Christian values. Dubhtach was one of the nine who revised the laws. What accorded with Christianity was kept, what did not was excised.\n\nFour poems ascribed to Dubhtach are extant; one in the Book of Rights, three in the Book of Leinster. Edward O'Reilly gives a full account of these in his \"Irish Writers\", XXX sq.; d. anno 433.\n\nDubthach may be related to Mo Laisse maccu Lugair, whose feast-day is given as 16 September in the \"Martyrology of Tallaght\" and \"Félire Óengusso\". Both martyrologies state that his church was found among the Uí Fhairchelláin, near Mountrath, County Laois.\n\nDubhtach was in a later tradition made a prospective husband for Saint Brigit. She declined him, but helped him find a bride. He is given as the father of several sons, all saints and founders of churches, mainly in Leinster. They included Fachtna of Kiltoom, in the barony of Fore, County Westmeath, other sons were Trian, Saint Gabhran, Saint Euhel, Moninne, Lonan and Saint Molaisse Mac Lugair. His granddaughter, Dediva (also called Editua or Dedi or Deidi or Deighe or Deidiu or Deaga or Mediva), daughter of Trian, was the alleged mother of saints and poets, including Saint Senan of Laraghabrine, son of Fintan, Saint Diarmaid the Just, son of Lugna, Saint Caillin, son of Niata, Saint Felim of Kilmore, son of Carill, Saint Daigh, son of Carill, Saint Femia, daughter of Carill, St. Manchin, son of Collan of Corann and Senchán Torpéist, another Chief Ollam of Ireland, which latter son is in keeping with the tradition of ollams coming generally from families who had a tradition of producing ollams.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20751608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20751608", "title": "Early left anterior negativity", "text": "Early left anterior negativity\n\nThe early left anterior negativity (commonly referred to as ELAN) is an event-related potential in electroencephalography (EEG), or component of brain activity that occurs in response to a certain kind of stimulus. It is characterized by a negative-going wave that peaks around 200 milliseconds or less after the onset of a stimulus, and most often occurs in response to linguistic stimuli that violate word-category or phrase structure rules (as in *\"the in room\" instead of \"in the room\"). As such, it is frequently a topic of study in neurolinguistics experiments, specifically in areas such as sentence processing. While it is frequently used in language research, there is no evidence yet that it is necessarily a language-specific phenomenon.\n\nMore recent work has criticized the design of many of the foundational studies that characterized the ELAN, such that apparent ELAN effects might be the result of spillover from words prior to the onset of the critical word. This raises important questions about whether the ELAN is a true ERP component or an artifact of certain experimental designs.\n\nThe ELAN was first reported by Angela D. Friederici as a response to German sentences with phrase structure violations, such as *\"the pizza was in the eaten\" (as opposed to \"the pizza was eaten\"); it can be elicited by English phrase structure violations such as *\"Max's of proof\" (as opposed to \"Max's proof\") or *\"your write\" (as opposed to \"you write\"). The ELAN is not elicited by sentences with other kinds of grammatical errors, such as subject-verb disagreement (*\"\"he go to the store\" rather than \"he goes to the store\"\") or grammatically dispreferred and \"awkward\" sentences (such as \"\"the doctor charged the patient was lying\" rather than \"the doctor charged that the patient was lying\"\"); it only appears when it is impossible to build local phrase structure.\n\nIt appears rapidly, peaking between 100 and 300 milliseconds after the onset of the grammatically incorrect stimulus (other reports have placed its time course, or \"latency\", between 100 and 200ms, \"under 200ms\", \"around 125 ms\", or \"about 160ms\"). The speed of the ELAN may also be affected by characteristic of the violating stimuli; the ELAN appears later to visual stimuli that are fuzzy or difficult to see, and may occur earlier in morphologically complex spoken words where much information about the meaning of the word precedes the word's recognition point.\n\nIts name derives from the fact that it is picked up most robustly by EEG sensors on the left front regions of the scalp; it may sometimes, however, have a bilateral (both sides of the scalp) distribution.\n\nSome authors consider the ELAN to be a separate response from the left anterior negativity (LAN), while others label it as just an early version of the LAN.\n\nThe ELAN has been reported in languages such as English, German, Dutch, Chinese, and Japanese. It is possible, though, that it is not a response specific to language (in other words, that the ELAN might also occur in response to non-linguistic stimuli).\n\nThe ELAN response has played an important role in studies of sentence processing, particularly in the development of the so-called \"serial model\" or \"syntax-first model\" of sentence processing. According to this model, the brain's first step in processing sentences is to organize input and build local phrase structure (for example, to take the words \"the\" and \"pizza\" and organize them into a noun phrase \"the pizza\"), and it does not process semantic information or meaning until after this step has succeeded. This model predicts that if the initial building of local phrase structure fails (as in the above examples *\"Max's of proof\" and *\"your write\") then semantic processing (the brain's interpretation of the meaning of the sentence) does not go forward. This has been tested by taking advantage of two brain responses: the ELAN, which reflects the phrase-structure-building, and the N400, which reflects semantic processing; the model predicts that sentences eliciting an ELAN (a violation of local phrase structure) will not elicit an N400, since the building of phrase structure is a prerequisite for semantic processing. These types of studies have had subjects read or listen to sentences that have both a syntactic and semantic violation in the same place. Some such studies have found such sentences to elicit an ELAN and no N400, thus supporting the claim of the \"serial model\", while others have found both an ELAN and an N400, challenging the model.\n\n"}

Florian Coulmas shows that language is the medium of business, an asset in itself and sometimes a barrier to trade\".\n\nStates shoulder language costs, because it maintains themselves by means of it, as does business which needs communication competence. Florian Coulmas discusses the language-related expenditures of government and business in Language and economy. In the same book he also discusses the role of language as a commodity, because languages can behave like economic systems. That is why socio-economic ecologies are (dis)favorable to particular languages. The spread of languages depends in an essential way on economic conditions. Language can be an expression of symbolic power. However, changes in the linguistic map of the world show that these are also powerful linked to economic developments in the world. Assigning an economic value to a certain language in the linguistic market place means vesting it with some of the privileges and power related to that language. Most language communities in the world practice this policy without any concern about \"reciprocity\" in language learning investments, forgetting the \"pursuit of linguistic justice as parity of esteem and while linguistic regimes are sometimes very unjust\".\n\nLanguages are capital investments in a literal sense : language technology is the most important one. It requires substantial investments which, in the absence of profitability, only affluent countries and businesses can afford. In this respect, today \"English is seen as a consequence and an instrument of American imperial power, an appreciable asset for American anglophones in the twenty-first-century global contest for competitive advantage, prosperity, and power\". Though the best business language remains the language of the customers, meaning multilingual business practices, an \"ideal' global economy presupposes a single language for the whole world. But an \"ideal\" global language presupposes a common acceptable and fair language burden for all business partners. See in this respect language tax to counteract linguistic inequality, as also language for purposes of trade incurs costs to most countries and private entreprises, whereas governments of countries whose language occupies a leading position on the international language market refuse to subsidize the spread of other languages for which they believe they have no need. In his report \"L'enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique\", François Grin argues that 'though some languages would be more beneficial in terms of cost-benefit analysis' such as e.g. Esperanto (Esperanto business groups such as IKEF have been active for many years), the problem is that a shifting pattern in the valuation of languages is not always brought about by rationally culculable factors only. In addition to its economic potential, language is also a carrier of political, cultural and sociopsychological properties. In spite of the non-economic values attached to language, what prevails in matters of language is often that which is profitable and this can lead to the superiority of a dominant language as a means of production, with a high linguistic capital value. In this respect it is evident to see that the will (or necessity) to learn English in the last decades has grown so much and its range of action has been so wide that the economic necessity and other incentives of foreign-language study are generally perceived as unimportant. For similar reasons, former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher tried to torpedo the LINGUA program of the European Community, as from her point of view, Britain was asked to pay for a program which benefited her country least. Because of the enormous imbalance on current accounts of the major European languages in favour of English, the LINGUA programme called for an expansion and diversification of foreign-language education in the Member States. For the individual speaker the unequal linguistic balances imply that the first language is an economically exploitable qualification for some who can simply marketing their mother tongue skills, whereas others can not.\n\n\n\n"}

With over articles , it is the 32nd-largest Wikipedia as measured by the number of articles, and the largest Wikipedia in a constructed language.\n\nChuck Smith, an American Esperantist, is considered to be Esperanto Wikipedia's founder. The encyclopedia started off when he imported the 139 articles of the by Stefano Kalb, which took him three weeks following November 15, 2001. Later on, he undertook a journey to Europe with the goal of popularizing Wikipedia among the speakers of Esperanto in European countries. For instance, already in November 2002 he gave a talk about Wikipedia at the 10th Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology in Dobřichovice (Czech Republic).\n\nEsperanto speakers have also been involved in the founding of several other language versions of the Wikipedia (Czech, Slovak, Ossetian, Swahili). The introduction of support for the Esperanto alphabet by Brion Vibber, an Esperanto speaker and later Wikimedia Foundation's first employee, in January 2002 has paved the way for alphabets of languages other than English and initiated the transition of the whole Wikipedia to Unicode.\n\nAs of July 2018, the Esperanto Wikipedia has 287 articles of () and a further 206 considered (). Weekly community projects include a () which improves neglected articles and an Article of the Week featuring good-quality articles on the front page. The Esperanto community is a frequent contributor to the Meta project, .\n\nAccording to the at Meta, a list based on , Esperanto ranks 36th, lacking almost none of the list of vital articles, but having in general relatively short articles.\n\nOn 18 November 2008, the Esperanto Wikipedia implemented the extension.\n\nAs of February 2012, the Esperanto Wikipedia had the 5th greatest number of articles per speaker among Wikipedias with over 100,000 articles, and ranked 11th overall. These figures were based on \"Ethnologue\"s estimate of 2,000,000 Esperanto speakers.\n\nDue to the geographical spread of its editors (see the box on the right), the Esperanto Wikipedia has a varied list of countries of origin of its editors.\n\nOn 13 August 2014 Esperanto Wikipedia reached 200,000 articles.\n\nAlong with learners and other Esperantists of all levels, many very experienced Esperantists and native Esperantists have joined the project. At least three editors are members of the Academy of Esperanto, Gerrit Berveling, John C. Wells, and Bertilo Wennergren, a notable Esperanto grammarian and the director of the Academy's section about Esperanto vocabulary.\n\nThe Esperanto Wikipedia has been featured in many Esperanto news media, including a radio interview at Radio Polonia, and articles at , , and . The Esperanto Wikimania, a gathering held in 2011 to celebrate the encyclopedia's 10th anniversary, has been subsidized by the host city of Svitavy (Czech Republic) and the Pardubice Region and covered by Czech Television.\n\nEsperanto organisations like Universal Esperanto Association do not contribute to but support it by providing chambers at Esperanto conventions for presentations and trainings. At the World Esperanto Congress in Rotterdam, summer 2008, there were two Wikipedian meetups and a lecture at the Esperantology Conference. In April 2013, (\"Esperanto and Free Knowledge\") was established as one of the first Wikimedia user groups.\n\nThe Esperanto Wikipedia community has created and published a 40-page \"Wikipedia: Practical Handbook\" () which is sold on-line and at conventions. The manual is intended to give new Wikipedians advice and information on how to edit Wikipedia in Esperanto. It is currently in its second printing.\n\n"}

This may be done either before (\"ante hoc\") or after (\"post hoc\") the text has been published or otherwise disseminated.\n\nAnte hoc fact-checking (fact-checking before dissemination) aims to remove errors and allow text to proceed to dissemination (or to rejection if it fails confirmations or other criteria). Post hoc fact-checking is most often followed by a written report of inaccuracies, sometimes with a visual metric from the checking organization (e.g., Pinocchios from \"The Washington Post\" \"Fact Checker,\" or \"TRUTH-O-METER\" ratings from PolitiFact). Several organizations are devoted to \"post hoc\" fact-checking, such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact.\n\nResearch on the impact of fact-checking is relatively recent but the existing research suggests that fact-checking does indeed correct misperceptions among citizens, as well as discourage politicians from spreading misinformation.\n\nOne study finds that fact-checkers PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and \"Washington Post's\" Fact Checker overwhelmingly agree on their evaluations of claims.\n\nHowever, a study by Morgan Marietta, David C. Barker and Todd Bowser found \"substantial differences in the questions asked and the answers offered.\" They concluded that this limited the \"usefulness of fact-checking for citizens trying to decide which version of disputed realities to believe.\"\n\nA paper by Chloe Lim, Ph.D. student at Stanford University, finds little overlap in the statements that fact-checkers check. Out of 1065 fact-checks by PolitiFact and 240 fact-checks by \"The Washington Post\"s Fact-Checker, there were only 70 statements that both fact-checkers checked. The study found that the fact-checkers gave consistent ratings for 56 out of 70 statements, which means that one out every five times, the two fact-checkers disagree on the accuracy of statements.\n\nStudies of \"post hoc\" fact-checking have made clear that such efforts often result in changes in the behavior, in general, of both the speaker (making them more careful in their pronouncements) and of the listener or reader (making them more discerning with regard to the factual accuracy of content); observations include the propensities of audiences to be completely unswayed by corrections to errors regarding the most divisive subjects, or the tendency to be more greatly persuaded by corrections of negative reporting (e.g., \"attack ads\"), and to see minds changed only when the individual in error was someone reasonably like-minded to begin with.\n\nA 2015 study found evidence a \"backfire effect\" (correcting false information may make partisan individuals cling more strongly to their views): \"Corrective information adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website significantly reduced belief in the myth that the flu vaccine can give you the flu as well as concerns about its safety. However, the correction also significantly reduced intent to vaccinate among respondents with high levels of concern about vaccine side effects--a response that was not observed among those with low levels of concern.\" A 2017 study attempted to replicate the findings of the 2015 study but failed to do so.\n\nA 2016 study found little evidence for the \"backfire effect\": \"By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments.\" A study of Donald Trump supporters during the 2016 race similarly found little evidence for the backfire effect: \"When respondents read a news article about Mr. Trump's speech that included F.B.I. statistics indicating that crime had \"fallen dramatically and consistently over time,\" their misperceptions about crime declined compared with those who saw a version of the article that omitted corrective information (though misperceptions persisted among a sizable minority).\" A 2018 study found no evidence of a backfire effect.\n\nStudies have shown that fact-checking can affect citizens' belief in the accuracy of claims made in political advertisement. A paper by a group of Paris School of Economics and Sciences Po economists found that falsehoods by Marine Le Pen during the 2017 French presidential election campaign (i) successfully persuaded voters, (ii) lost their persuasiveness when fact-checked, and (iii) did not reduce voters' political support for Le Pen when her claims were fact-checked. A 2017 study in the \"Journal of Politics\" found that \"individuals consistently update political beliefs in the appropriate direction, even on facts that have clear implications for political party reputations, though they do so cautiously and with some bias... Interestingly, those who identify with one of the political parties are no more biased or cautious than pure independents in their learning, conditional on initial beliefs.\"\n\nA study by Yale University cognitive scientists Gordon Pennycook and David G. Rand found that Facebook tags of fake articles \"did significantly reduce their perceived accuracy relative to a control without tags, but only modestly\". A Dartmouth study led by Brendan Nyhan found that Facebook tags had a greater impact than the Yale study found. A \"disputed\" tag on a false headline reduced the number of respondents who considered the headline accurate from 29% to 19%, whereas a \"rated false\" tag pushed the number down to 16%. The Yale study found evidence of a backfire effect among Trump supporters younger than 26 years whereby the presence of both untagged and tagged fake articles made the untagged fake articles appear more accurate. In response to research which questioned the effectiveness of the Facebook \"disputed\" tags, Facebook decided to drop the tags in December 2017 and would instead put articles which fact-checked a fake news story next to the fake news story link whenever it is shared on Facebook.\n\nBased on the findings of a 2017 study in the journal \"Psychological Science,\" the most effective ways to reduce misinformation through corrections is by:\nA forthcoming study in the \"Journal of Experimental Political Science\" found \"strong evidence that citizens are willing to accept corrections to fake news, regardless of their ideology and the content of the fake stories.\"\n\nA paper by Andrew Guess (of Princeton University), Brendan Nyhan (Dartmouth College) and Jason Reifler (University of Exeter) found that consumers of fake news tended to have less favorable views of fact-checking, in particular Trump supporters. The paper found that fake news consumers rarely encountered fact-checks: \"only about half of the Americans who visited a fake news website during the study period also saw any fact-check from one of the dedicated fact-checking website (14.0%).\"\n\nA 2018 study found that Republicans were more likely to correct their false information on voter fraud if the correction came from Breitbart News rather than a non-partisan neutral source such as PolitiFact.\n\nA 2015 experimental study found that fact-checking can encourage politicians to not spread misinformation. The study found that it might help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. The researchers sent, \"a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.\"\n\nOne experimental study found that fact-checking during debates affected viewers' assessment of the candidates' debate performance and \"greater willingness to vote for a candidate when the fact-check indicates that the candidate is being honest.\"\n\nA study of Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign found that while fact-checks of false claims made by Trump reduced his supporters' belief in the false claims in question, the corrections did not alter their attitudes towards Trump.\n\nPolitical fact-checking is sometimes criticized as being opinion journalism. In September 2016, a Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that \"just 29% of all Likely U.S. Voters trust media fact-checking of candidates' comments. Sixty-two percent (62%) believe instead that news organizations skew the facts to help candidates they support.\"\n\nThe Reporters' Lab at Duke University maintains a database of fact-checking organizations that is managed by Mark Stencel and Bill Adair. The database tracks more than 100 non-partisan organizations around the world. The Lab's inclusion criteria is based on whether the organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the benefits of printing only checked copy is that it averts serious, sometimes costly, problems, e.g. lawsuits and discreditation. Fact-checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes; they are not guaranteed safeguards against those who wish to commit journalistic frauds\n\nThe possible societal benefit of honing the fundamental skill of fact-checking has been noted in a round table discussion by Moshe Benovitz, who observes that \"modern students use their wireless worlds to augment skepticism and to reject dogma,\" but goes on to argue that this has positive implications for values development. He argues:\nHe closes, noting that this constitutes \"new opportunities for students to contribute to the discussion like never before, inserting technology positively into academic settings\" (rather than it being seen as purely as agent of distraction).\n\nOne journalistic controversy is that of admitted and disgraced reporter and plagiarist Stephen Glass, who began his journalism career as a fact-checker. The fact-checkers at \"The New Republic\" and other weeklies for which he worked never flagged the numerous fictions in Glass's reporting. Michael Kelly, who edited some of Glass's concocted stories, blamed himself, rather than the fact-checkers, saying: \"Any fact-checking system is built on trust ... If a reporter is willing to fake notes, it defeats the system. Anyway, the real vetting system is not fact-checking but the editor.\" \n\n\nThe following is a list of individuals for whom it has been reported, reliably, that they have played such a fact-checking role at some point in their careers, often as a stepping point to other journalistic endeavors, or to an independent writing career:\n\n\n"}

Many fora were constructed at remote locations along a road by the magistrate responsible for the road, in which case the forum was the only settlement at the site and had its own name, such as Forum Popili or Forum Livi.\n\nIn addition to its standard function as a marketplace, a forum was a gathering place of great social significance, and often the scene of diverse activities, including political discussions and debates, rendezvous, meetings, et cetera. In that case it supplemented the function of a conciliabulum.\n\nEvery municipium had a forum. Fora were the first of any civitas synoecized whether Latin, Italic, Etruscan, Greek, Celtic or some other. The first forums were sited between independent villages in the period, known only through archaeology. After the rise of the Roman Republic, the most noted forum of the Roman world, the Roman Forum in Rome itself, served as a model of new construction. By the time of the late Republic expansions refurbishing of the forums of the city had inspired Pompey Magnus to create the Theatre of Pompey in 55 BC. The Theatre included a massive forum behind the theatre arcades known as the Porticus Pompei (Colonnades of Pompey). The structure was the forebearer to Julius Caesar's first Imperial forum and the rest to follow.\n\nOther major fora are found in Italy; however, they are not to be confused with the piazza of the modern town, which may have originated from a number of different types of ancient civic centers, or more likely was its own type. While similar in use and function to fora, most were created in the Middle Ages and are often not a part of the original city footprint.\n\nFora were a regular part of every Roman province in the Republic and the Empire, with archaeological examples at:\n\nIn new Roman towns the forum was usually located at, or just off, the intersection of the main north-south and east-west streets (the Cardo and Decumanus). All fora would have a Temple of Jupiter at the north end, and would also contain other temples, as well as the Basilica; a public weights and measures table, so customers at the market could ensure they were not being sold short measures; and would often have the baths nearby. At election times, candidates would use the steps of the temples in the forum to make their election speeches, and would expect their clients to come to support them.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276235", "title": "Gevil", "text": "Gevil\n\nGevil or Gewil () is animal hide that has been prepared as a writing material in Jewish scribal documents, in particular a Sefer Torah (Torah scroll).\nAccording to most views of Jewish Law, a sefer Torah (scroll) should be written on gevil as was done by Moses for the original Torah scroll he transcribed. Further, a reading of the earliest extant manuscripts of the Mishneh Torah indicate that gevil was halakha derived from Moses and thus required for Torah scrolls.\n\nMaimonides wrote that it is the law transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai that a Torah scroll must be written on \"gevil\" or alternatively on \"klaf\" and that scrolls written on an alternative material are invalid for use, however it is preferable that they be written on \"gevil\" (Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillin 1:14).\n\n\"Gevil\" is a form of skin made from the whole hide, after the hair is removed. The precise requirements for processing \"gevil\" are laid by the Talmud, Geonim and Rishonim. They were reconfirmed as \"the law according to Moses\" by Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah. According to law, the preparation of gevil hide must include salt, flour and \"mey afatzim\" (wasp residue/gall-nut water). Gall nuts—rich in tannic acid—are a tree's reaction to an invasive parasitic wasp's egg; the pure black tint of the ink used on Torahs results from the reaction between the tannic acid and iron sulfate (a powder used to make the ink).\n\nThere are three forms of skin known to Jewish law. The other two qualities result from splitting the hide into two layers; however, there is some confusion about their identification. \nOthers deviate from this process, and use modern chemical processes. However, some believe that this invalidates the parchment for scribal use.\n\nAccording to the \"Halakhot Gedolot\", klaf is the inner layer, adjacent to the flesh, while \"dukhsustos\" is the outer layer, on which the hair grows. The same view is expressed in the oldest extant manuscripts and critical editions of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah and the Babylonian Talmud. This is also the same definition which appears in the minor Talmudic tractate called Sofrim. However, more recent authorities reverse the two descriptions, and many printed editions of the Mishneh Torah are \"adjusted\" to reflect this. The reason for this original adjustment away from the original definition is a mystery. Some suspect that copying errors are to blame. As a result, many have become confused, in terms of which part of the skin should be used for writing. Using the full hide known as gevil for Sifrei Torah does avoid this issue, unfortunately this solution won't work for tefilin which must be written on Klaf and are not kosher if written on gevil.\n\nAccording to the Talmud (Tractate Bava Batra 14b and Gittin 54b), \"gevil\" existed during the time of Moses (approximately 1280 BCE); Moses is described as using \"gevil\" for the Torah scroll he placed into the Holy Ark of the Covenant. Elsewhere in the Talmud (Tractate Gittin 54b), there is testimony that Torah scrolls were written on \"gevil\".\n\nToday, a handful of Jewish scribes and artisans continue to make scroll material in this way. However, the majority of Torah scrolls are written on \"klaf\", in their belief that the Talmud recommends (as opposed to requires) \"gevil\" and relates to the optimal beautification of the scrolls rather than an essential halachic requirement. Given the uncertainty about which layer of the hide is in fact the \"klaf\", there is a growing movement for insisting on a return to \"gevil\" in Torah scrolls - in order to avoid all doubts. Clearly, the antiquity of gevil (as the original practice) is not being debated by anyone.\n\nMost of the Dead Sea Scrolls (200 BCE), found in and around the caves of Qumran near the Dead Sea, are written on \"gevil\".\n\nProperly, \"klaf\" should be used for tefillin and \"dukhsustos\" for mezuzot. Once more, this rule is often relaxed in practice but there is a minority which seeks to return to the actual law.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "557710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=557710", "title": "Gimmick (professional wrestling)", "text": "Gimmick (professional wrestling)\n\nIn professional wrestling, a gimmick generally refers to a wrestler's in-ring persona, character, behaviour, attire and/or other distinguishing traits while performing which are usually artificially created in order to draw fan interest.\n\nThese in-ring personalities often involve costumes, makeup and catchphrases that they shout at their opponents or the fans.\n\nGimmicks can be designed to work as good guys (babyfaces) or villains (heels) depending on the wrestler's desire to be popular or hated by the crowd. A tweener gimmick falls between the two extremes. A wrestler may portray more than one gimmick over their career depending on the angle or the wrestling promotion that they are working for at that time.\n\nPromotions will use gimmicks on more than one person, albeit at different times, occasionally taking advantage of a masked character which allows for the identity of the wrestler in question to be concealed. Razor Ramon was portrayed by both Scott Hall and Rick Bognar.\n\nOccasionally, a wrestler uses a gimmick as tribute to another worker; such is the case of Ric Flair's Nature Boy persona which he took on as an homage to the original Nature Boy, Buddy Rogers.\n\nWhen a wrestler acts outside his or her gimmick this is known as 'breaking kayfabe', a term showing pro wrestling's linkages to theatre, where the more common term \"breaking the fourth wall\" is used.\n\nGimmicks are annually rated for the Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards by the publication's owner, professional wrestling journalists, and various industry insiders, such as Dave Meltzer, promoters, agents and performers, other journalists, historians, and fans. The two awards are given to the best and worst gimmick of that year. Current winners are Los Ingobernables de Japon and Bray Wyatt respectively.\n\nPro wrestling's history has been tied to the use of gimmicks from its infancy. From its circus origins in the 1830s, showmen presented wrestlers under names such as “Edward, the steel eater”, “Gustave d’Avignon, the bone wrecker”, or “Bonnet, the ox of the low Alps” and challenged the public to knock them down for 500 francs.\n\nDuring the late 19th century-early 20th century, when wrestler Frank Gotch rose to prominence, the focus became on contests largely legitimate (see catch wrestling), which largely resulted in the abandoning previous character gimmicks.\n\nIt was not until the First Golden Age of Professional Wrestling in the United States during the 1940s–1950s, when Gorgeous George created pro wrestling's first major gimmick. His heel character focused on his looks and quickly antagonized the fans with his exaggerated effeminate behaviour. Such showmanship was unheard of for the time; and consequently, arena crowds grew in size as fans turned out to ridicule George.\n\nGorgeous George's impact and legacy on wrestling gimmicks was enormous, demonstrating how fast television changed the product from athletics to performance. Before him, wrestlers gimmicks imitated \"ethnic terrors\" (Nazis, Arabs, etc.), but his success birthed a more individualistic and narcissist form of character.\n\nHe was one of the first pro-wrestlers to use entrance music, \"Pomp and Circumstance\" which always played as he made his way to the ring.\n\nIn Britain, television took British wrestling to the next level when in 1964, it went full-time as part of the \"World of Sport\" show.\n\nThe style of wrestling at the time was unique with strong emphasis on clean technical wrestling. Heels made up a minority of the roster, with most shows containing an abnormally high proportion of clean sportsmanly matches between two \"blue-eyes\" (as faces were known backstage in the UK). This would remain the case for several decades to come. Gimmick matches were a rarity, midget wrestling failed to catch on, while women were banned by the Greater London Council until the late 1970s.\n\nDuring the Second Golden Age of pro wrestling in the 1980s–1990s a rise of cartoonish, outlandish gimmicks became popular with the increase of World Wrestling Federation's popularity.\n\nThe WWF contributed to the explosion of gimmicks by becoming the most colourful and well-known wrestling brand because of its child-oriented characters, soap opera dramatics and cartoon-like personas. Most notable was the muscular Hulk Hogan, who marked the 1980s with his \"all-American\" gimmick and made his main events into excellent ratings draws. His dominant role in the industry at that time led to this era to be also known as \"Hulkamania\". Around this time, wrestling became a form of entertainment rather than an official sport.\n\nOther wrestlers from this era with similarly outlandish characterisation include Ric Flair, Sting and The Undertaker.\n\nIn recent years, the emphasis has been on more realistic gimmicks which portray the wrestler as an actual person, sometimes using their real names, albeit with exaggerated personality traits. Wrestlers like Randy Orton, Batista, and John Cena are prime examples of this.\n\nExaggerating the characteristics of a wrestler's (on occasion fabricated) origin is one of the most commonly exploited gimmicks, in which overarching characteristics of a character play up to clichés and stereotypes.\n\nA long list of wrestlers in this category includes: African (Kamala, Abdullah The Butcher), Bulgarian (Rusev), Canadian (Team Canada (TNA), Team Canada (WCW)), Cowboy (Bob Orton Jr.), French (La Résistance), Irish (Finlay, Sheamus), Iranian (The Iron Sheik, Ariya Daivari), Hawaiian (Leilani Kai, Ricky Steamboat), Indian (The Great Khali, Jinder Mahal), Italian (Santino Marella), Jamaican (Kofi Kingston), Korean (Gail Kim), Mexican (Alberto Del Rio, The Mexicools), Native American/American Indian (Chief Jay Strongbow, Tatanka), Russian (Vladimir Kozlov, Nikolai Volkoff, Lana), Samoan (Samoa Joe, The Wild Samoans), Swiss (Cesaro), and Thai (Super Invader).\n\nThe undeniable influence of the Puroresu style in the world of Professional Wrestling has resulted in many wrestlers using fabricated Japanese origins or being billed from a Japanese city, without actually being natives of the country. Prime examples of this include Yokozuna, Awesome Kong, Hawaiians Professor Tanaka and Mr. Fuji, and British wrestler Kendo Nagasaki. Several Japanese wrestlers who wrestle outside of their home country are known to play up or exaggerate aspects of their cultural heritage as part of their gimmicks for an overseas audience.\n\nMasked wrestlers made their appearance in Europe (Theobaud Bauer in France, 1865) and the United States (Mort Henderson as \"Masked Marvel\" in 1915) considerably earlier than in Mexico, but it was the latter that popularised the use of masks. This, in some cases to signify a high-flyer style, influenced by Lucha Libre.\n\nA specific masked gimmick may be used by more than one wrestler at a wrestling company's request since their identity can be permanently concealed. This is the case of Mexican Sin Cara and Japanese Tiger Mask. Masks also allow a wrestler to perform as more than one character for a variety of wrestling promotions.\n\nOther wrestlers that have used masks in their performances include: Mexican-Americans Rey Misterio and Kalisto, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame inductee Big Van Vader, Bryan Danielson during his masked American Dragon phase, Japanese legend Jyushin Thunder Liger and British wrestler El Ligero.\n\nA high number of wrestlers who start their careers in another sport incorporate their athletic abilities as part of their act. That is the case for Olympic medallist Kurt Angle, who previously competed in freestyle wrestling and alludes to it in his attire and wrestling style. Brock Lesnar is also an ex-amateur wrestler, NFL player and UFC champion.\n\nIn the women's division, Ric Flair's daughter Charlotte has a gymnastics and volleyball background, Dana Brooke was a gymnast for 18 years and is a well known fitness competitor whilst Naomi was a cheerleader and dancer for NBA team Orlando Magic.\n\nThe theatrical nature of Professional Wrestling easily blends with comic hero characters, made popular in the 1980s by legend The Ultimate Warrior and Sting, whose character was inspired by the 1994 movie \"The Crow\", based on the comic book of the same name.\n\nOther wrestlers with superhero gimmicks include late WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes' sons Gold and Stardust, Samoan Rosey during his \"the Super Hero in Training\" (the S.H.I.T.) phase and his tag-team partner The Hurricane and valet Stacy Keibler.\n\nSome of these characters are brought during very short periods of time for entertainment value. The Joker and Harley Quinn from the Batman comics have inspired wrestling attire for Sting and Alexa Bliss respectively. Finn Bálor's Demon King persona is visually based on Spider-Man villains Venom and Carnage.\n\nSimilarly to superheros, supernatural characters add to entertainment value. Most famously in this category is The Undertaker, considered one of the most respected wrestlers in the business, whose gimmick is a horror-themed character of an undead, macabre and paranormal dark presence prone to scare tactics. He was managed by the ghostly character that was Paul Bearer and tagged with his half-brother Kane in The Brothers of Destruction stable.\n\nOther wrestlers displaying supposed supernatural powers include Matt Hardy (as his Broken/Woken persona), Bray Wyatt, Mordecai, Papa Shango, and The Boogeyman. Japanese Onryo portrays a dead wrestler who returned for vengeance.\n\nThe Brood was a vampire stable, composed of Gangrel, Christian and Edge.\n\nSince its beginnings in the circus circuit, the professional wrestler's stereotype has been that of large, powerful and strong. Various wrestlers have banked on the larger size which has influenced their in-ring style and persona.\n\nNotable examples of these kind include Swede Tor Johnson, who weighed 181 kilograms, Big Show (7 ft 2 in), André the Giant (7 ft 4in), The Great Khali (7 ft 3 in), Gorilla Monsoon (182 kg), Awesome Kong (123 kg) and Big Boss Man (6 ft 6 in).\n\nWhilst humour has long been present in Professional Wrestling matches and many wrestlers incorporate elements of comedy in their act, full on comedic gimmicks are not commonly seen. These are sometimes reserved for wrestlers who not always have the stereotypical physique required in the industry and instead exploit their entertainment abilities.\n\nWrestlers who fall under this category are Scottish comedian and actor Grado, Doink The Clown which was majorly portrayed by Matt Osborne until 2013, Ring of Honor's Colt Cabana, Santino Marella, Japanese Wrestlers Stalker Ichikawa, Gran Naniwa and Kuishinbo Kamen, Charlie Haas during his impersonations run, and WWE's 1990s turkey character Gobbledy Gooker. Damien Sandow is also in this category, he always mocks what ever his opponents do.\n\nUsually a villainous gimmick, initiated by Gorgeous George. Wrestlers that followed on with this trend include Bobby Roode, Ravishing Rick Rude, Rick Martel, TNA's Mr Pec-tacular, Curt Hennig's Mr Perfect, NXT's Tyler Breeze, WWE's The Miz, Canadian Tye Dillinger's Perfect 10 and women's tag team The Beautiful People.\n\nMusic influences are another popular choice for gimmicks, as demonstrated by John Cena's original rapper character, CM Punk's straight edge iconoclast hardcore punk, party boy Adam Rose, Chris Jericho, The Honky Tonk Man, Disco Inferno, Brodus Clay and his fun-loving, funk dancing gimmick \"The Funkasaurus\" and WWE's Fandango who includes salsa dancing in his routine.\n\nThe millionaire tyrant character works well as a villain in contrast to professional wrestling's working class fan-base. It is because of this audience that Dusty Rhodes' \"Common Man\" was highly successful with the crowds.\n\nThe original gimmick of this type was created by \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase which consequently inspired wrestlers like Mr. McMahon, Tiger Ali Singh, JBL and most recently Alberto Del Rio's arrogant rich Mexican aristocrat character.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4108811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4108811", "title": "Information commons", "text": "Information commons\n\nAn information commons is an information system, such as a physical library or online community, that exists to produce, conserve, and preserve information for current and future generations. Wikipedia could be considered to be an information commons to the extent that it produces and preserves information through current versions of articles and histories. Other examples of an information commons include Creative Commons.\n\nThe concept of the \"information commons\" refers to the shared knowledge-base and the processes that facilitate or hinder its use. It also refers to a physical space, usually in an academic library, where any and all can participate in the processes of information research, gathering and production. The term commons refers to the land (or common grounds) that villagers shared for grazing purposes in simpler times. The issues that fall under this topic are varied and include:\n\nSome believe that the increasing control and commodification of information restricts humanity's ability to encourage and foster positive developments in its cultural, academic, and economic growth.\n\nThe internet took the information commons to another level. The internet age empowered consumers to become creators, producers, and distributors of information. The internet facilitated a decentralized production and distribution of information. It bypasses the control of some of the more traditional publishing methods. These information are neither regulated by managers nor are they coordinated by price signals in the market. This result in a common-based production of knowledge that can be easily shared among individuals.\n\nThe \"software commons\" consists of all computer software which is available at little or no cost and which can be reused with few restrictions. It includes open source software which can be modified with few restrictions. However the commons also includes software outside of these categories – for instance, software which is in the public domain.\n\nMany innovative programmers have and released open source applications to the public, without the restrictive licensing conditions of commercial software. A popular example is Linux, a open source operating system. The server computers for Google Search run Linux.\n\nOpen-source programs started emerging in the 1960s. IBM was one of the first computer companies to offer their products to the public. Most of these computers came with free software that was universal among similar computers, and could be altered by anyone with the software. This changed in the 1970s when IBM decided to take more control of their products, removing the source codes and not allowing the redistribution of their software.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s the software commons grew with the help of a bulletin board servers, accessed with dial-up modems. This expanded in the late 1990s with the growth of the Internet, which facilitated international cooperation and allowed individuals and groups to share their products more freely. The GNU Project was founded in 1983 to develop free software.\n\nIn 1998 Netscape Communications Corporation announced that all future versions of their software would be free of charge and developed by an Open Source Community (Mozilla). This included Netscape Navigator, then the most popular web browser.\n\nLicensing is the process that copyright owners use to monitor reproduction, distribution, or other use of creative works. Many commercial licensing conditions are costly and restrictive. Licensing models used in information commons typically grant permission for a wide range of uses. The GNU General Public License (GPL), developed by Richard Stallman at MIT in the 1980s is one such license: \"The GNU Free Documentation License is a form of copyleft intended for use on a manual, textbook or other document to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifications, either commercially or non-commercially.\" \n\n“In the 1980s, many professional societies turned over their journal publishing to private firms as a way to contain membership fees and generate income.” Prices of scholarly journals rose dramatically and publishing corporations restricted access to these journals through expensive licenses. Research libraries had no other choice but to cut many of their journal subscriptions. European and American academic communities began to find alternate ways to distribute and manage scholarly information. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) was founded in 1998. “It is an international alliance of academic and research libraries working to correct imbalances in the scholarly publishing system. Its pragmatic focus is to stimulate the emergence of new scholarly communication models that expand the dissemination of scholarly research and reduce financial pressures on libraries.\" \n\n\n"}

After a Masters in Biochemistry from Karnataka University, Dharwad, he moved to Mumbai where he worked as a chemist for many years. He now lives in Bangalore with his wife Smita and two children, Srajana (daughter) who is an Odissi dancer and a researcher/curator, and Ritwik(son), a multimedia artist. Apart from Kannada Jayanth is fluent in Konkani (his mother tongue), Marathi, Hindi and English.\n\nKaikini is regarded as one of the most significant of the younger writers in Kannada today. He is a writer of short stories, film scripts and poetry, and is based in Bangalore. His poetry is characterised by subtle imagism, a minute documentation of the seemingly commonplace, a colloquial idiom and a conscientious refusal to engage in any poeticising. He has so far published six anthologies of short stories, four books of poetry, three plays and a collection of essays.\n\nIn an introduction to Dots and Lines, an English translation of Kaikini’s short stories, critic C.N. Ramachandran writes, “To understand Jayanth’s works, we have to situate him in the literary context of the last two decades of the 20th century. During that period, there arose a group of writers who consciously differed from both the earlier Modernist writers (called Navya in Kannada) and those contemporaneous to them, the Writers of Protest (called Bandaya in Kannada) and Dalit writers. They did not subscribe to any particular philosophical or political system of thinking – be it Existentialism of the Modernists or the Leftist ideologies of the Dalit and Protest writers. On the other hand, what they wished to do was to select precise and authentic details of daily life and organise them in such a way as to culminate in a particular experience . . . Generally, their style was comic-ironic; and the language they used was the spoken language of day-to-day life. They were neither idealists nor cynics; they just wished to observe the life around them – generally mediocre – to register all the fleeting details that marked an ordinary man’s daily routine, and lead up to an experience rich in connotations. Jayanth was a major figure in this group of writers who, loosely, can be called ‘post-modernist’.”\n\nDr. Jayanth Kaikini started writing lyrics to film songs beginning from movie Chigurida Kanasu.\nHe is the credited with revolutionising the image of Kannada film songs, with the classic touch of literature and beautiful imagery. Films like Mungaaru Male, Gaalipata, Milana etc. have some touching and memorable songs with lyrics penned by him.\n\nHe was hosting a TV Show \"Rasa Rushige Namaskara\" in Etv Kannada which a biography on Rashtrakavi Kuvempu. This show was very popular with a particular section of audience. He continued it with other series' such as \"Kadala Theerada Bharghava\"..etc.Lately he was seen judging the\nreality show \"Yede tumbi Haaduvenu\" along with the legendary singer S.P.Balasubrahmanyam and famous Kannada music director and lyricist naada brahma Hamsalekha.\n\nKaikini received the Karnataka Sahitya Academy award for his first poetry collection at the age of nineteen in 1974. He received the same award again in 1982, 1989 and 1996 for his short story collections. He has been awarded the Dinakara Desai award for his poetry, the B. H.

{"id": "622529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=622529", "title": "Logical atomism", "text": "Logical atomism\n\nLogical atomism is a philosophy that originated in the early 20th century with the development of analytic philosophy. Its principal exponent was the British philosopher Bertrand Russell. It is also widely held that the early work (the \"Tractatus\" and pre-\"Tractatus\" writings) of his Austrian-born pupil and colleague, Ludwig Wittgenstein, defend a version of logical atomism. Some philosophers in the Vienna Circle were also influenced by logical atomism. Rudolf Carnap was also deeply sympathetic to some of the philosophical aims of logical atomism. Gustav Bergmann also developed a form of logical atomism that focused on an ideal phenomalistic language, particularly in his discussions of J.O. Urmson's work on analysis.\n\nThe name for this kind of theory was coined in March 1911 by Russell, in a work published in French titled \"Le Réalisme analytique\" (published in translation as \"Analytic Realism\" in Volume 6 of \"The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell\"). Russell was developing and responding to what he called \"logical holism\"—i.e., the belief that the world operates in such a way that no part can be known without the whole being known first. This belief is commonly called monism, and Russell (and G. E. Moore) criticized the absolute idealism dominant then in Britain and exemplified in works of F. H. Bradley and J. M. E. McTaggart. Logical atomism is partly understood as a developed alternative to logical holism, or the \"monistic logic\" of Idealists, on which logical analysis is a kind of falsification.\n\nThe theory holds that the world consists of ultimate logical \"facts\" (or \"atoms\") that cannot be broken down any further. Having originally propounded this stance in his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", Wittgenstein rejected it in his later \"Philosophical Investigations\" (§§46–49, §81, §91).\n\nThe term \"logical atomism,\" partly because it was first introduced in a French paper that remained untranslated in Russell's lifetime, became widely associated with Russell's views in the English-speaking world after Russell gave a series of lectures in January-to-March 1918 under the title \"The Philosophy of Logical Atomism\". These lectures were subsequently published in 1918 and 1919 in \"The Monist\" (Volumes 28 and 29), which at the time was edited by Phillip Jourdain. Russell's ideas as presented in 1918 were also influenced by Wittgenstein, as he explicitly acknowledges in his introductory note. This has partly contributed to the widely-held view that Wittgenstein was also a logical atomist, as has Wittgenstein's atomistic metaphysics developed in the \"Tractatus\".\n\nHowever, logical atomism has older roots. Russell and Moore broke themselves free from British Idealism in the 1890s. And Russell's break developed along its own logical and mathematical path. His views on philosophy and its methods were heavily influenced by revolutionary nineteenth-century mathematics by figures like Cantor, Dedekind, Peano, and Weierstrass. As he says in his 1901 essay, republished in his 1917 collection \"Mysticism and Logic, and Other Essays\" under the title \"Mathematics and the Metaphysicians\":What is now required is to give the greatest possible development to mathematical logic, to allow to the full the importance of relations, and then to found upon this secure basis a new philosophical logic, which may hope to borrow some of the exactitude and certainty of its mathematical foundation. If this can be successfully accomplished, there is every reason to hope that the near future will be as great an epoch in pure philosophy as the immediate past has been in the principles of mathematics. Great triumphs inspire great hopes; and pure thought may achieve, within our generation, such results as will place our time, in this respect, on a level with the greatest age of Greece. (pg. 96)As we can see, Russell thought the revolutionary mathematical work could, through the development of logic, produce a similar revolution in philosophy. This ambition overlays the character of Russell's work from 1900 onward. Russell believes in fact that logical atomism, fully carried out and implemented throughout philosophy, is the realization of his 1901 ambition. As he says in the 1911 piece where he coins the phrase \"logical atomism\":The true method, in philosophy as in science, should be inductive, meticulous, respectful of detail, and should reject the belief that it is the duty of each philosophy to solve all problems by himself. It is this method which has inspired analytic realism [a.k.a. logical atomism], and it is the only method, if I am not mistaken, with which philosophy will succeed in obtaining results as solid as those obtained in science. (pg. 139)Logical atomism rightly makes logic central to philosophy. In doing so, it makes philosophy scientific, at least in Russell's view. As he says in his 1924 \"Logical Atomism\":The technical methods of mathematical logic, as developed in this book [\"Principia Mathematica\"], seem to me very powerful, and capable of providing a new instrument for the discussion of many problems that have hitherto remained subject to philosophical vagueness.In summary, Russell thought that a moral of the revolutionary work in mathematics was this: equally revolutionary work in philosophy could occur, if we only make logic the essence of philosophizing. This aspiration lies at the origin, and motivates and runs through, logical atomism.\n\nRussell referred to his atomistic doctrine as contrary to the tier \"of the people who more or less follow Hegel\" (PLA 178).\n\nThe first principle of logical atomism is that the World contains \"facts\". The facts are complex structures consisting of objects (\"particulars\"). A fact may be that an object has a property or that it stands in some relation to other objects. In addition, there are judgments (\"beliefs\"), which are in a relationship to the facts, and by this relationship either true or false.\n\nAccording to this theory, even ordinary objects of daily life \"are apparently complex entities\". According to Russell, words like \"this\" and \"that\" are used to denote particulars. In contrast, ordinary names such as \"Socrates\" actually are definitive descriptions. In the analysis of \"Plato talks with his pupils\", \"Plato\" needs to be replaced with something like \"the man who was the teacher of Aristotle\".\n\nIn 1905, Russell had already criticized Alexius Meinong, whose theories led to the paradox of the simultaneous existence and non-existence of fictional objects. This theory of descriptions was crucial to logical atomism, as Russell believed that language mirrored reality.\n\nBertrand Russell's theory of logical atomism consists of three interworking parts: the atomic proposition, the atomic fact, and the atomic complex. An atomic proposition, also known as an elemental judgement, is a fundamental statement describing a single entity. Russell refers to this entity as an atomic fact, and recognizes a range of elements within each fact that he refers to as particulars and universals. A particular denotes a signifier such as a name, many of which may apply to a single atomic fact, while a universal lends quality to these particulars, e.g. color, shape, disposition. In Russell's Theory of Acquaintance, awareness of these particulars and universals comes through sense data. Every system consists of many atomic propositions and their corresponding atomic facts, known together as an atomic complex. In respect to the nomenclature that Russell used for his theory, these complexes are also known as molecular facts in that they possess many atoms. Rather than decoding the complex in a top-down manner, logical atomism analyzes its propositions individually before considering their collective effect. According to Russell, the atomic complex is a product of human thought and ideation that combines the various atomic facts in a logical manner.\n\nRussell's perspective on belief proved a point of contention between him and Wittgenstein, causing it to shift throughout his career. In logical atomism, belief is a complex that possesses both true and untrue propositions. Initially, Russell plotted belief as the special relationship between a subject and a complex proposition. Later, he amended this to say that belief lacks a proposition, and instead associates with universals and particulars directly. Here, the link between psychological experience – sense data – and components of logical atomism – universals and particulars – causes a breach in the typical logic of the theory; Russell’s logical atomism is in some respects defined by the crossover of metaphysics and analytical philosophy, which characterizes the field of naturalized epistemology.\n\nIn his theory of Logical Atomism, Russell posited the highly controversial idea that for every positive fact exists a parallel negative fact: a fact that is untrue. The correspondence theory maintains that every atomic proposition coordinates with exactly one atomic fact, and that all atomic facts exist. The Theory of Acquaintance says that for any given statement taking the form of an atomic proposition, we must be familiar with the assertion it makes. For example, in the positive statement, “the leaf is green,” we must be acquainted with the atomic fact that the leaf is green, and we know that this statement corresponds to exactly this one fact. Along this same line, the complementary negative statement, “the leaf is not green,\" is clearly false given what we know about the color of the leaf, but our ability to form a statement of this nature means that a corresponding fact must exist. Regardless of whether the second statement is or isn't true, the connection between its proposition and a fact must itself be true. One central doctrine of Logical Atomism, known as the Logically Perfect Language Principle, enables this conclusion. This principle establishes that everything exists as atomic proposition and fact, and that all language signifies reality. In Russell’s viewpoint, this necessitates the negative fact, whereas Wittgenstein maintained the more conventional Principle of Bivalence, in which the states \"P\" and \"Not (P)\" cannot coexist.\n\nIn his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", Ludwig Wittgenstein explains his version of logical atomism as the relationship between proposition, state of affairs, object, and complex, often referred to as “Picture theory”. In view of Russell’s version, the propositions are congruent in that they are both not convoluted statements about an atomic entity. Every atomic proposition is constructed from “names” that correspond to “objects”, and the interaction of these objects generate “states of affairs,” which are analogous to what Russell called atomic facts. Where Russell identifies both particulars and universals, Wittgenstein amalgamates these into objects for the sake of protecting the truth-independence of his propositions; a self-contained state of affairs defines each proposition, and the truth of a proposition cannot be proven by the sharing or exclusion of objects between propositions. In Russell’s work, his concept of universals and particulars denies truth-independence, as each universal accounts for a specific set of particulars, and the exact matching of any two sets implies equality, difference implies inequality, and this acts as a qualifier of truth. In Wittgenstein’s theory, an atomic complex is a layered proposition subsuming many atomic propositions, each representing its own state of affairs.\n\nWittgenstein's handling of belief was dismissive and reflects his abstention from the epistemology that concerned Russell. Because his theory dealt with understanding the nature of reality, and because any item or process of the mind barring positive fact, i.e. something absolute and without interpretation, may become altered and thus divorced from reality, belief exists as a sign of reality but not reality itself. Wittgenstein was decidedly skeptical of epistemology, which tends to value unifying metaphysical ideas while depreciating the casewise and methodological inspection of philosophy that dominates his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Furthermore, Wittgenstein concerned himself with defining the exact correspondence between language and reality wherein any explanation of reality that defies or overburdens these semantic structures, namely metaphysics, becomes unhinged. Wittgenstein’s work bears the exact philosophical determinants that he openly admonished, hence his later abandonment of this theory altogether.\n\nAt the time Russell delivered his lectures on logical atomism, he had lost contact with Wittgenstein. After World War I, Russell met with Wittgenstein again and helped him publish the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, Wittgenstein's own version of Logical Atomism.\n\nAlthough Wittgenstein did not use the expression \"Logical Atomism\", the book espouses most of Russell's logical atomism except for Russell's Theory of Knowledge (T 5.4 and 5.5541). By 1918 Russell had moved away from this position. Nevertheless, the \"Tractatus\" differed so fundamentally from the philosophy of Russell that Wittgenstein always believed that Russell misunderstood the work.\n\nThe differences relate to many details, but the crucial difference is in a fundamentally different understanding of the task of philosophy. Wittgenstein believed that the task of philosophy was to clean up linguistic mistakes. Russell was ultimately concerned with establishing sound epistemological foundations. Epistemological questions such as how practical knowledge is possible did not interest Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein investigated the \"limits of the world\" and later on meaning. For Wittgenstein, metaphysics and ethics were nonsensical, though he did not mean to devalue their importance in life by describing them in this way. Russell, on the other hand, believed that these subjects, particularly ethics, though belonging not to philosophy nor science and of possessing an inferior epistemological foundation, were of certain interest.\n\nThe immediate effect of the \"Tractatus\" was enormous, particularly by the reception it received by the Vienna Circle. However, it is now claimed by many contemporary analytic philosophers, that the Vienna Circle misunderstood certain sections of the \"Tractatus\". The indirect effect of the method, however, was perhaps even greater long-term, especially on Logical Positivism. Wittgenstein eventually rejected the atomism in Logical Atomism in his posthumously published book, \"Philosophical Investigations\", and it is debatable whether he ever held the wide-ranging version that Russell expounded in his 1918 logical atomism lectures. Russell, on the other hand, never abandoned logical atomism. In his 1959 \"My Philosophical Development\", Russell said that his philosophy evolved and changed many times in his life, but he described all these changes as an \"evolution\" stemming from his original \"revolution\" into logical atomism in 1899-1900: There is one major division in my philosophical work: in the years 1899-1900, I adopted the philosophy of logical atomism and the technique of Peano in mathematical logic. This was so great a revolution as to make my previous work, except such as was purely mathematical, irrelevant to everything that I did later. The change in these years was a revolution; subsequent changes have been of the nature of an evolution. (Chapter 1: \"Introductory Outline\")Even into the 1960s, Russell claimed that he \"rather avoided labels\" in describing his views—with the exception of \"logical atomism.\"\n\n\n"}

In time he became schoolmaster at Esker National School, hence his nickname,\"The Schoolmaster of Esker\". Writing in 2018, Martyn said of him:\nMany details of his early life remain unknown. The only man of the name documented in the 1821 census is thirty-two year old Michael Burke, his twenty-six year old wife, Mary, and their two year old daughter, Mary; but Michael is listed as a “Farmer & Labourer” (Mary a “Flax spinner”) and resided at “Careenlea, Kiltullagh”. Therefore, identifying him with Micheál de Búrc is problematic. \nKnown as a good scholar who spoke, read and wrote in Latin, Greek, Irish and English, de Búrc emigrated to the United States sometime after 1839. Jeremiah O'Donovan wrote that as of 1853, “He teaches in the [Roman Catholic] Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn .. is both a scholar and poet, and composes in the Irish language”. De Búrc died at his home in Brooklyn in 1881.\n\nDe Búrc's chief claim to fame is the poem \"Oíche na Gaoithe Móire\" (Night of the Big Wind), concerning a severe windstorm which swept across Ireland on the night of 6–7 January 1839 causing severe damage to property and several hundred deaths. According to Mary Burke,\nThe hurricane-like storm of 1839 arrived suddenly after a strangely calm day, plunging towns into immediate darkness, which magnified the terror. Author Peter Carr notes that eddying winds caused the contents of houses to dance in the air and the din forced those huddled together to sign in order to communicate. Thousands hastily abandoned badly built and suddenly roofless houses, innumerable farm animals perished, and the Shannon flooded vast areas of the surrounding countryside. ... Irish-speaking areas constituted the island’s poorest and most isolated regions, so there is a double silence to their unrecorded and unrecordable suffering.\n\"Oíche ...\" runs to fifteen verses which give a very vivid description of the event, comparing it to God venting his anger as he did with the Deluge. However, de Búrc noted that the damage caused made good work for tradesmen such as thatchers, slaters, carpenters and masons.\nWhile Martyn notes that the poem \"was well known in de Búrc's lifetime ... both he and it had been entirely forgotten by the 1900s, even in his home parish, as was the language in which it was composed.\"\n\n\n"}

He worked in his father's television repair shop and began programming for his family's business at age 15. He was commander of his AFJROTC squadron as a junior in high school, while attending joint-enrollment college classes at the local community college. Forming a software company called Robitron Software Research, Inc. in 1987 with his father, Robert J. Garner, and his sister Pam, he worked as a software developer until 1997 when his father retired and the company was disbanded.\n\nOne of the first web chatterbots, named Max Headcold, was written by Garner in 1995. Max served two purposes, to collect data about web chat behavior and to entertain customers of the FringeWare online bookstore. This program was eventually implemented as a Java package called JFRED, written by Paco Nathan based on the C++ FRED CGI program, and his own influences from Stanford and various corporations.

Garner and Copple believe that intelligence may be built one facet at a time, rather than depending on some general purpose theory to emerge.\n\nCompeting in six Loebner Prize contests, he used the competition as a way to test his prototypes on the judges each year. After winning the contest twice in 1998 and 1999 with his program called Albert One, he began collaborating with other software developers in a variety of conversational systems. Garner created the Robitron Yahoo Group in 2002 as a forum and virtual watering hole for Loebner Prize contest participants and discussion of related topics.\n\nThe multifaceted approach, presented at a colloquium on conversational systems in November 2005, involves multiple chat bots working under the control of a master control program.

He also wrote many popular serialized radio and television programs.\n\nHis novels, which include \"Ghorbangah\", \"Bedoone Esgh Hargez\", \"Ghobad\" and \"Gharatgaran\" were suspenseful stories usually marked by themes of sacrifice, honour, and family tragedy.\n\nIn 1980, following the Islamic revolution, he was forced to flee Iran as the environment was no longer safe for a journalist and author known for his glorification of Persian monarchical history. He settled in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and died there in 1991.\n\nSaloor had a passion for storytelling; his stories, usually set in Ancient Persia, expressed the importance of family and the patriarchal figure as a symbol of self-sacrifice. In terms of literary technique, he was heavily influenced by Persian literary masters such as Ferdowsi, but also by American cinema, particularly Westerns. A master of building suspense, his stories were a constant draw for radio audiences in the 1960s.\n\nSaloor's books remain in print to this day, and many of his stories continue to be serialized in Iranian newspapers across North America.\n\nHe was the great-grandson of Abdol-samad Mirza Ezz ed-Dowleh Saloor.\n\n"}
{"id": "745944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=745944", "title": "Samaritan Hebrew", "text": "Samaritan Hebrew\n\nSamaritan Hebrew () is a reading tradition used liturgically by the Samaritans for reading the Ancient Hebrew language of the Samaritan Pentateuch, in contrast to Biblical Hebrew (the language of the Masoretic Jewish Pentateuch).\n\nFor the Samaritans, Ancient Hebrew ceased to be a spoken everyday language and was succeeded by Samaritan Aramaic, which itself ceased to be a spoken language some time between the 10th and 12th centuries and was succeeded by Arabic (or more specifically Samaritan Palestinian Arabic).\n\nThe phonology of Samaritan Hebrew is very similar to that of Samaritan Arabic, used by the Samaritans in prayer. Today, the spoken vernacular among Samaritans is evenly split between Modern Israeli Hebrew and Palestinian Arabic, depending on whether they reside in Holon (Israel) or in Shechem (i.e. Nablus, in Palestine’s Area A).\n\nThe Samaritan language first became known in detail to the Western world with the publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1631 by Jean Morin. In 1616 the traveler Pietro della Valle had purchased a copy of the text in Damascus, and this manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library. Between 1815 and 1835, Wilhelm Gesenius wrote his treatises on the original of the Samaritan version, proving that it postdated the Masoretic text.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1977 Ze'ev Ben-Haim published in five volumes his monumental Hebrew work on the Hebrew and Aramaic traditions of the Samaritans. Ben-Haim, whose views prevail today, proved that modern Samaritan Hebrew is not very different from Second Temple Samaritan, which itself was a language shared with the other residents of the region before it was supplanted by Aramaic.\n\nSamaritan Hebrew is written in the Samaritan alphabet, a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which in turn is a variant of the earlier Phoenician alphabet.\n\nThe Samaritan alphabet is close to the script that appears on many Ancient Hebrew coins and inscriptions. By contrast, all other varieties of Hebrew, as written by Jews, employ the later 'square' Hebrew alphabet, which is in fact a variation of the Aramaic alphabet that Jews began using in the Babylonian captivity following the exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE. During the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use this stylized \"square\" form of the script used by the Achaemenid Empire for Imperial Aramaic, its chancellery script while the Samaritans continued to use the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which evolved into the Samaritan alphabet.\n\nConsonants\nVowels\n\nSamaritan Hebrew shows the following consonantal differences from Biblical Hebrew: The original phonemes */b g d k p t/ do not have spirantized allophones, though at least some did originally in Samaritan Hebrew (evidenced in the preposition \"in\" ב- /af/ or /b/). */p/ has shifted to /f/ (except occasionally */pː/ > /bː/). */w/ has shifted to /b/ everywhere except in the conjunction ו- 'and' where it is pronounced as /w/. */ɬ/ has merged with /ʃ/, unlike in all other contemporary Hebrew traditions in which it is pronounced /s/. The laryngeals /ʔ ħ h ʕ/ have become /ʔ/ or null everywhere, except before /a ɒ/ where */ħ ʕ/ sometimes become /ʕ/. /q/ is sometimes pronounced as [ʔ], though not in Pentateuch reading, as a result of influence from Samaritan Arabic. /q/ may also be pronounced as [χ], but this occurs only rarely and in fluent reading.\n\nPhonemic length is contrastive, e.g. /rɒb/ רב 'great' vs. /rɒːb/ רחב 'wide'. Long vowels are usually the result of the elision of guttural consonants.\n\n/i/ and /e/ are both realized as [ə] in closed post-tonic syllables, e.g. /bit/ בית 'house' /abbət/ הבית 'the house' /ger/ גר /aggər/ הגר. In other cases, stressed /i/ shifts to /e/ when that syllable is no longer stressed, e.g. /dabbirti/ דברתי but דברתמה /dabbertimma/. /u/ and /o/ only contrast in open post-tonic syllables, e.g. ידו /jedu/ 'his hand' ידיו /jedo/ 'his hands', where /o/ stems from a contracted diphthong. In other environments, /o/ appears in closed syllables and /u/ in open syllables, e.g. דור /dor/ דורות /durot/.\n\nStress generally differs from other traditions, being found usually on the penultimate and sometimes on the ultimate.\n\nThis: masc. ze, fem. zéot, pl. ílla.\n\nThat: alaz (written with a \"he\" at the beginning).\n\nWho, which: éšar.\n\nWho? = mi. What? = ma.\n\nWhen suffixes are added, ê and ô in the last syllable may become î and û: bôr (Judean bohr) \"pit\" > búrôt \"pits\". Note also af \"anger\" > éppa \"her anger\".\n\nSegolates behave more or less as in other Hebrew varieties: beţen \"stomach\" > báţnek \"your stomach\", ke′seph \"silver\" > ke′sefánu (Judean Hebrew \"kaspe′nu\") \"our silver\", dérek > dirkakimma \"your (m. pl.) road\" but áreş (in Judean Hebrew: \"’e′rets\") \"earth\" > árşak (Judean Hebrew \"’arts-ekha\") \"your earth\".\n\nThe definite article is a- or e-, and causes gemination of the following consonant, unless it is a guttural; it is written with a \"he\", but as usual, the \"h\" is silent. Thus, for example: énnar / ánnar = \"the youth\"; ellêm = \"the meat\"; a'émur = \"the donkey\".\n\nRegular plural suffixes are -êm (Judean Hebrew -im) masc., -ôt (Judean Hebrew: -oth.) fem: eyyamêm \"the days\", elamôt \"dreams\".\n\nDual is sometimes -ayem (Judean Hebrew: a′yim), šenatayem \"two years\", usually -êm like the plural yédêm \"hands\" (Judean Hebrew \"yadhayim\".)\n\nSamaritans have the tradition of either spelling out loud with the Samaritan letters\n\n\"Yohth, Ie', Baa, Ie’ \"\n\nor saying \"Shema\" meaning \"(The Divine) Name\" in Aramaic, similar to Judean Hebrew \"Ha-Shem\" .\n\nAffixes are:\n\n\"in, using\", pronounced:\n\n\"as, like\", pronounced:\n\n\"to\" pronounced:\n\n\"and\" pronounced:\n\nOther prepositions:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It may involve two or more people who act out roles in a sexual fantasy and may be a form of foreplay and be sexually arousing. Many people regard sexual roleplay as a means of overcoming sexual inhibitions. It may take place in the real world, or via an internet forum, chat-room, video-game, or email—allowing for physically or virtually impossible erotic interests to be enacted.\n\nHow seriously the play is taken depends on the people involved, and the scenario may be anywhere from simple and makeshift to detailed and elaborate, complete with costumes and a script. Nearly any role could become the base material for an erotic experience, and there is no limit to what objects an individual could consider sexual. It may, for example, involve wearing of a costume which is regarded as erotic, such as a miniskirt and stockings, or one or both partners being nude, say for an evening. It may involve elements of dominance and submission, passivity or obedience. It may involve sexual bondage, either being restrained or a sex partner being restrained.\n\nDepending on the play scenario, the roleplay may be before spectators, and bystanders may be unknowing participants in a roleplay. For example, the roleplay may involve house guests or may be taken out of a couple's home and into, say, a bar, street, park etc. A role may require, for example, one or both partners to flirt with a stranger, or for one partner to seduce the other partner's friend, etc. It may also call for one or both partners to, say, strip in a car or park.\n\nThe popularity of the Internet has also allowed for online sexual encounters, known as cybersex, which may involve roleplay.\n\nMany of the most common sexual roleplays involve a power differential and form part of the dominance and submission aspect of BDSM. Roles can be general designations of power positions, or very specific, detailed fantasies. Some people, such as those living the Gorean lifestyle make use of an entire imaginary world. The controlling player is often called the top or \"dominant\" while the controlled individual is called the bottom or \"submissive\". It can be considered dangerous and therefore a safeword is advised to continue the safety of other(s) in such acts.\n\nCommon scenarios include:\n\nOther scenarios include:\n\nSexologist Gloria Brame lists a number of these scenarios, as does Trevor Jacques.\n\n"}

{"id": "1740732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1740732", "title": "Tamil grammar", "text": "Tamil grammar\n\nMuch of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest available grammar book for Tamil, the \"Tolkāppiyam\" (dated between 300 BC and 500 AD). Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar \"\" which restated and clarified the rules of the Tolkāppiyam, with some modifications.\n\nTraditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely , sol, porul, yāppu, and . Of these, the last two are mostly applicable in poetry. The following table gives additional information about these parts.\n\"\" defines and describes the letters of the Tamil alphabet and their classification. It describes the nature of phonemes and their changes with respect to different conditions and locations in the text.\n\n\"Sol\" defines the types of the words based on their meaning and the origin. It defines the gender, number, cases, tenses, classes, harmony, etc. This chapter also provides rules for compounding the words.\n\n\"Porul\" defines the contents of poetry. It gives guidance on which topic to choose for poetry based on certain conditions like the nature of the land or time or the people. It gives a distinction between \"Agam\" (Internal / love life) and \"Puram\" (external / worldly life).\n\n\"yāppu\" defines rules for composing Traditional poetry. It defines the basic building block \"Asai\" and describes how \"asai\" should be joined to form a \"sīr\", joining \"sīr\" for an \"adi\". \n\n\"\" defines techniques used for comparing, praising and criticizing the taken topics.\n\nThe script of Tamil Language consists of 247 letters. The script falls under the category Abugida, in which consonant-vowel sequences are written as a unit. The grammar classifies the letters into two major categories. \n\n12 vowels and 18 consonants are classified as the prime letters. \n\nThe Vowels are called \"uyir\", meaning soul, in Tamil. The consonants are known as \"mei\", meaning body. When the alphasyllabary is formed, the letter shall be taking the form of the consonants, that is the body, and the sound shall be that of the corresponding vowel, that is the soul.\n\nThe vowels are categorized based on the length, as short (\"kuril\") and long(\"nedil\"). The short vowels are pronounced for a duration 1 unit, while the long vowels take two units. Based on the duration of the sound, the vowels form 5 pairs. The other two vowels ஐ(\"ai\") and ஔ(\"au\") are diphthongs formed by joining the letters அ(a)+இ(i) and அ(a)+உ(u). Since these two are a combination two short letters, their pronunciation takes 2 units of time, that is they fall under \"nedil\" category. ஐ(ai) and ஔ(au) can also be spelt அய் and அவ். This form is known as \"eḻuttuppōli\" and is generally not recommended.\n\nThe consonants are categorised into three groups, வல்லினம்'vallinam'(hard), மெல்லினம்'mellinam'(soft) and இடையினம்'idaiyinam'(medium), based on the nature of the sound.\n\nFrom the 30 prime letters, the dependent letters are formed.\n\nTamil grammar defines 10 categories of Dependent letters. \n\n\nThe alphasyllabic letters are formed by combining the consonants and the vowels. The duration of the sound is that of the inherent vowel. They are 216 in total. For example, the table below shows the formation of க் based letters.\n\n\"Aidam\" is also known as \"thaninilai\" (stand alone). The aidam is always preceded by a single short letter (தனிக்குறில்) and followed by a hard alphasyllabic letter (வல்லின உயிர்மெய்). It takes half unit time for pronunciation.\n\n\"Uyiralabedai\" (உயிரளபெடை) and \"Otralabedai\" (ஒற்றளபெடை) are formed by elongating the duration of pronunciation of a letter to satisfy certain grammatical rules while composing poetry. In \"Uyiralabedai\", the intrinsic vowel of the letter that is elongated is written next to it, to indicate that the letter now is pronounced for 3 units of time. \n\nIn \"Kutriyalukaram\", the duration of the short 'u' letters of \"vallinam\" category (கு, சு, டு, து, பு, று) is reduced to half units, when the letter is found at the end of the word, preceded by multiple letters or a single \"nedil\"(long) letter. \n\nIf a word with \"kutriyalikaram\" is followed by a word with 'ய'(ya) as the first letter, the \"u\" sound is corrupted to \"i\" sound and takes a half unit of time for pronunciation. \n\nIn \"Aikarakurukkam\" and \"Aukarakurukkam\", the duration of the letters ஐ and ஔ are reduced to 1 1/2 units if they are the first letters of the word. If situated elsewhere it is reduced to 1 unit.\n\nIn Tamil, a single letter standing alone or multiple letters combined together form a word. Tamil is an agglutinative language. Tamil words consist of a lexical root to which one or more affixes are attached.\n\nMost Tamil affixes are suffixes. Tamil suffixes can be \"derivational suffixes\", which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or \"inflectional suffixes\", which mark categories such as person, number, mood, tense, etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of agglutination, which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes, which would require several words or a sentence in English. To give an example, the word \"pōgamuḍiyādavargaḷukkāga\" (போகமுடியாதவர்களுக்காக) means \"for the sake of those who cannot go\", and consists of the following morphemes:\nWords formed as a result of the agglutinative process are often difficult to translate. According to Today Translations, a British translation service, the Tamil word \"செல்லாதிருப்பவர்\" (\"cellaathiruppavar\", meaning a certain type of truancy †) is ranked 8th in \"The Most Untranslatable Word In The World\n\nIn Tamil, words are classified into four categories namely,\n\nAll categories of nouns are declinable. Verbs are conjugated to indicate person, tense, gender, number and mood. The other two classes are indeclinable. \n\nThe nouns stand for the names of objects both animate and inanimate, and abstract concepts. Tamil is agglutinative language and can be declined. Nouns are the collections of names of Animate/Inanimate objects (பொருட்பெயர்), Places (இடப்பெயர்), concepts of time (காலப்பெயர்), Names of limbs of Animate/Inanimate objects (சினைப்பெயர்), qualitative nouns (பண்புப்பெயர்) and Verbal nouns (தொழிற்பெயர்). \n\nNouns of place (இடப்பெயர்) stands for both conceptual names like \"town\", \"village\", \"heaven\" and real names like \"New York\", \"Amsterdam\". \n\nNouns of time (காலப்பெயர்), includes units of time, names of days of the week, names of months and seasons. \n\nNouns of Quality (பண்புப்பெயர்), includes the nature and quality of the abstract and tangible objects. Example: Names of tastes, shape, quantity, etc.\n\nThe nouns are divided into two main classes based on rationality: The \"high class\" (உயர்திணை uyartiṇai ), and the \"lower class\" ( அஃறிணை aḵṟiṇai). \n\nAll the rational beings fall under the category of \"high class\". Examples could be Adult humans and deities.\nAll the irrational beings and inanimate objects fall under the \"lower class\". Examples could be animals, birds, plants and things. Since children are considered to be irrational, the word \"kuḻandai\" (Child) is considered \"lower class\" ( அஃறிணை aḵṟiṇai) or neuter. \n\nThe grammatical gender of Tamil nouns corresponds to their natural sex. Nouns in Tamil have two numbers, singular and plural.\n\nGrammatical gender in Tamil, known as \"pāl\" in Tamil, encompasses both the concepts of gender and number. Masculine and Feminine genders are only applicable to \"higher class\" nouns. Even though the genders of animals are marked in a sentence (Eg: பெண் நாய்,), grammatically they are handled as a neuter noun. Thus there are five genders in Tamil. Namely, Masculine Singular(ஆண்பால் \"āṇpāl\"), Feminine Singular(பெண்பால் \"peṇpāl\"), high-class plural (பலர்பால் \"palarpāl\"), lower-class singular (ஒன்றன்பால் \"oṉṟaṉpāl\"), lower-class plural (பலவின்பால் \"palaviṉpāl\"). It is summarized in the table below.\n\nIn Tamil, the demonstrative particles are \"a\"- (அ), \"i\"- (இ), and \"u\"- (உ)(archaic and has fallen out of use). These demonstrative particles display deictic properties. \"i\"- (இ) is a near deixis form, which demonstrates the objects around/near the first person, while \"a\"- (அ) has distant deixis form, which demonstrates things near the 3rd person. \"u\"- (உ) was used indicate objects near the second person, but has gradually fallen out of use. In modern Tamil \"i\"- (இ) indicates objects nearer and \"a\"- (அ) indicates objects in a distance. Using these particles demonstrative pronouns are derived. The same set of pronouns is also used as personal pronouns in 3rd person. eg. \"avan\" (he), \"adhu\" (that object/being), \"andha\" (that)\n\n\"e\"- (எ) and \"yā-\" யா are the two important interrogative particles in Tamil. \"e\"- (எ) is used for deriving the interrogative pronouns. eg. \"evan\" (which one, 3rd person singular masculine), \"endha\" (which), \"edaṟku\" (for what?)\n\nFirst person plural pronouns in Tamil, distinguish between inclusive and exclusive we. In Tamil, plural terminators are used for honorific addressing. It could be noted in both 2nd and 3rd persons. There are unique personal pronouns available for first and second persons while demonstrative pronouns are used in place of personal pronouns as well.\n\nLike Tamil nouns, Tamil verbs are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of suffixes, which show person, number, mood, tense and voice, as is shown by the following example \"azḥintukkoṇṭiruntēṉ\" (அழிந்துக்கொண்டிருந்தேன்) \"(I) was being destroyed\":\n\nPerson and number are indicated by suffixing the oblique case of the relevant pronoun (\"ēn\" in the above example). The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from grammatical particles, which are added to the stem.\n\nTamil has two voices. The first - used in the example above - indicates that the subject of the sentence \"undergoes\" or \"is the object of\" the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence \"directs\" the action referred to by the verb stem. These voices are not equivalent to the notions of \"transitivity\" or \"causation\", or to the active-passive or reflexive-nonreflexive division of voices found in Indo-European languages.\n\nTamil has three simple tenses - past, present, and future - indicated by simple suffixes, and a series of perfects, indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same morphemes which mark tense categories. These signal whether the happening spoken of in the verb is unreal, possible, potential, or real. Tamil verbs also mark evidentiality, through the addition of the hearsay clitic \".\"\n\nTamil has no articles. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number \"one\" as an indefinite article, or by the context. In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between inclusive pronouns that include the listener and exclusive pronouns that do not. Tamil does not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs - both fall under the category \"uriccol\". Conjunctions are called \"iṭaiccol\".\n\nVerb auxiliaries are used to indicate \"attitude\", a grammatical category which shows the state of mind of the speaker, and his attitude about the event spoken of in the verb. Common attitudes include pejorative opinion, antipathy, relief felt at the conclusion of an unpleasant event or period, and unhappiness at or apprehension about the eventual result of a past or continuing event.\n\nExcept in poetry, the subject precedes the object, and the verb concludes the sentence. In a standard sentence, therefore, the order is usually subject–object–verb (SOV), but object–subject–verb is also common.\n\nTamil is a null-subject language. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs and objects. It is possible to construct valid sentences that have only a verb, such as \"muṭintuviṭṭatu\" (முடிந்துவிட்டது) \"It is completed\", or only a subject and object, such as \"atu eṉ vīṭu\" (அது என் வீடு) \"That is my house\".\n\nThe elements that are present, however, must follow the SOV order. Tamil does not have an equivalent for the word \"is\"; the word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning. The verb \"to have\" in the meaning \"to possess\" is not translated directly, either. To say \"I have a horse\" in Tamil, a construction equivalent to \"There is a horse to me\" or \"There exists a horse to me\", is used.\n\nTamil lacks relative pronouns, but their meaning is conveyed by relative participle constructions, built using agglutination. For example, the English sentence \"Call the boy who learned the lesson\" is said in Tamil like \"That-lesson-learned-boy call\".\n\nA sample passage in Tamil script with an ITRANS-like transliteration.\n\n\"aasiriyar vakuppukkuL nuzhainthaar\".\n\"avar uLLE nuzhainthavudan maaNavarkaL ezhunthanar\".\n\"vaLavan mattum than arukil ninRu kondiruntha maaNavi kanimozhiyudan pEsik kondirunthaan\".\n\"naan avanai echarithEn.\"\n\nEnglish translation of the passage given above:\nThe teacher entered the classroom.\nAs soon as he entered, the students got up.\nOnly Valavan was talking to Kanimozhi who was standing next to him.

{"id": "1438442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1438442", "title": "Verbum dicendi", "text": "Verbum dicendi\n\nA verbum dicendi (Latin for \"word of speaking\" or \"verb of speaking\"), also called verb of utterance, is a word that expresses speech or introduces a quotation. English examples of verbs of speaking include \"say\", \"utter\", \"ask\" and \"rumble\". Because a verbum dicendi (\"verb of speaking\") often introduces a quotation, it may grammaticalize into a quotative.\n\nThe plural of \"verbum dicendi\" is \"verba dicendi\".\n\nA complement of a verbum dicendi can be direct or indirect speech. Direct speech is a single unit of linguistic object that is '\"mentioned\" rather than used.' In contrast, indirect speech is a proposition whose parts make semantic and syntactic contribution to the whole sentence just like parts of the matrix clause (i.e. the main clause/sentence, as opposed to an embedded clause).\n\nCross-linguistically, there are syntactic differences between direct and indirect speech, which include verbatimness, interpretations of deictic expressions, tense, presence or absence of complementizers, and syntactic opacity.\n\nIf a complement of a verbum dicendi is direct speech, it is presented as a faithful report of what the original speaker exactly said. In the following examples, (1)a entails that \"I will go to Tokyo\" was the exact sentence that John uttered. In (1)b, on the other hand, John might have uttered a different sentence, for example, \"I'll spend my vacation in Tokyo.\"(1)a. John said (to me): \"I will go to Tokyo\"(1)b. John said (to me) that he would go to Tokyo.\n\nIf a complement of a verbum dicendi is direct speech, deictic expressions in the complement are interpreted with respect to the context in which the original sentence was uttered. In (2)a, the embedded clause is direct speech; the first person pronoun \"I\" and the second person pronoun \"you\" in \"\"I\" will give \"you\" a hand\" respectively refer to the utterer and the addressee in the context in which this quoted speech was uttered. In contrast, if the embedded clause is indirect speech, all deictic expressions in the sentence are interpreted in the context in which the matrix clause is uttered. In (2)b, the embedded clause is indirect speech, so all the occurrences of the first person pronoun \"me\" and the second person pronoun \"you\" in the sentence respectively refer to the utterer and the addressee in the immediate context in which 2(b) is uttered.(2)a. You said to me: \"\"I\" will give \"you\" a hand.\"(2)b. You said to me that \"you\" would give \"me\" a hand.\n\nSome languages, including English, show difference in tense between direct and indirect quotes. This phenomenon is formalized as \"the sequence of tense rules.\"\n\nIn some languages, the distinction between direct and indirect speech can be diagnosed by presence of an overt complementizer. Many languages, including English, have an overt complementizer (e.g. \"that\" in English) when the complement of a verbum dicendi is indirect speech, as seen in (1)b and 2(b) above. Some languages, such as Tikar, on the other hand, use an overt complementizer to introduce indirect speech.\n\nIf a complement of a verbum dicendi is direct speech, it is \"syntactically opaque,\" meaning that syntactic elements inside this embedded clause cannot interact with elements in the matrix clause.\n\nFor example, Negative Polarity Items (NPI) inside an embedded direct quote cannot be licensed by a syntactic element in the matrix clause.(3)a. ?Nobody said \"we saw anything.\"(3)b. Nobody said that they had seen anything.Note that (3)a is still syntactically well-formed but cannot communicate the same meaning as (3)b, in which the NPI \"anything\" inside the embedded indirect quote [they had seen anything] is licensed by \"nobody\" in the matrix clause.\n\nAnother example is that wh-movement out of an embedded direct quote is prohibited, as seen in (4)a below.(4)a. *What did John say: \"I read _\"?(4)b. What did John say that he had read _?\n\nIn English, verba dicendi such as \"say\" and \"think\" are used to report speech and thought processes.\n\nSuch examples are prototypical, but many variants exist within an open class of manner-of-speaking verbs, such as \"ask\", \"shout\", \"scream\", \"wonder\", \"yell\", \"holler\", \"bellow\", \"grunt\", \"mumble\", \"mutter\", etc. These may be considered semantically more specific, implying a clause type (as in \"ask\") or indicating the intensity or prosody of the reported material (e.g. \"shout\", \"mutter\").\n\nQuotation indicates to a listener that a message originated from a different voice, and/or at a different time than the present. An utterance like “Jim said ‘I love you’” reports at the present moment that Jim said “I love you” at some time in the past. Thus, there are two distinct active voices: that of the narrator and that of the reportee.\nWritten English often employs manner-of-speaking verbs or verba dicendi in conjunction with quotation marks to demarcate the quoted content. Speakers use more subtle phonetic and prosodic cues like intonation, rhythm, and mimesis to indicate reported speech.\n\nThere are numerous syntactically and semantically relevant properties of verba dicendi and manner-of-speaking verbs, several of which are highlighted below:\n\ni. They are so-called Activity Verbs. They may occur in progressive and imperative forms, among other tests:\nii. The subject of verba dicendi is normally sentient:\n\nHowever, it is possible, at least colloquially, to assign the subject role of some verba dicendi to a non-sentient entity. An expression like \"When you're late, it says you don't care.\" could be one such example.\n\niii. Verba dicendi may have an indirect object, which may be marked by \"to\" and which is also normally sentient:\niv. Manner-of-speaking verbs may have a direct object, which may be a noun describing the speech act itself, a desentential complement (that-clause, indirect question or infinitive), or a direct quotation:\nFurther, the direct object of some manner-of-speaking verbs may be deleted, resulting in a sentence that does not indicate an act of communication, but rather a description of the sound made:\nOther verba dicendi do not permit this, however. \"Say\", \"ask\", \"tell\", for instance, cannot occur freely without an object:\n\"Speak\" may occur without an object. In fact, its occurrence with an object is restricted. A that-clause, for example, is ungrammatical:\nv. Some manner-of-speaking verbs may occur with directional adverbials, which cannot co-occur with indirect objects:\nOther verba dicendi cannot occur in \"at\" constructions:\nvi. Some manner-of-speaking verbs may have a nominal (noun) counterpart which sounds the same, but which has no communicative content, such as \"mutter\", \"bellow\", \"shriek\", \"whine\" and \"whisper\". Notice that other verba dicendi do not have these homophonous nouns (e.g. \"speak\"/\"speech\", \"tell/tale\", \"declare/declaration\").\nThere are many such observations. Another property of verbs of speaking is the lack of so-called factivity effect; in other words, the speaker is not required to actually believe what they are saying. This has implications for the truth conditions of quotative constructions:\nMary’s statement may be false, though it may be true that she actually said it. In fact, she may even believe it to be false. However, whether or not believing is part of speaking has been debated for some time.\n\nThe syntax of quotation and verba dicendi appears at first glance to be a straightforward case of transitivity, in which the quoted material is interpreted as a direct object. In a case like\n\nthe traditionally held analysis takes the reported clause “I love you” to be the complement of \"say\". Thus the quote is termed an NP (noun phrase) and introduced as a direct object.\n\nThis analysis is supported by some of the typical syntactic tools for testing direct objects, such as moving into the focus of a question and clefting. However, constituency, movement and replacement tests show that the quotative clause does not behave like a normal transitive construction. For example, clefting and passivization of these forms give marked (ungrammatical, or strange at least) results:\nQuotation may also be less restricted than ordinary transitive verbs. They may occur parenthetically, unlike other verbs:\nAnother issue is that manner-of-speaking verbs are not always obligatorily transitive. Verbs like \"think\", \"laugh\", \"scream\", \"yell\", \"whisper\" may be intransitive.\nA different model has been proposed, which does not rely on transitivity, but rather an asymmetrical construction containing a reporting clause (head) and an independent reported clause. Note that the asymmetry arises from the fact that the reporting clause is dependent on the quoted content for grammaticality, while the reverse is not true.\nIn this model, the dependent clause has a site of elaboration (e-site) which is filled by the independent clause:\n\nDirect quotation is reported from the perspective of the experiencer: \nHowever, indirect quotation is often paraphrased, and reported by a narrator from the perspective of the reportee. Verbs like \"ask\" and \"tell\" are frequently associated with indirect speech. English indirect quotation also shows a sequence-of-tense effect: a past tense reporting verb requires a \"back-shift\" in verb tense within the indirect quote itself\nIndirect quotation is, in theory, syntactically constrained and requires that the quoted content form a subordinate clause under the CP node. However, what is heard in speech does not necessarily conform to theory. The complementizer \"that\", though considered to be a marker of indirect quotation, is not obligatory and is often omitted. Further, it can (and does) occur with direct quotes in some dialects of English (e.g. Hong Kong, Indian). \nVerbs of speaking often employ the Conversational Historical Present tense, whereby actions in the past are referred to with present-tense morphology. This is considered to add immediacy or authority to the discourse. However, it also illustrates the difficulty in differentiating direct and indirect quotation. \n\nSentences with verba dicendi for direct quotation may use the somewhat antiquated verb-first (V2) order of English syntax. Inversion of this type with verbs of speaking or thinking frequently occurs in written English, though rarely in spoken English. It is also possible to invert the clause without changing subject-verb order. This is not possible with regular English transitives:\nThere are several restrictions, however. For example, quantifiers may occur to the right of the subject in a non-inverted quotative sentence, but not in an inverted sentence. They can, however, occur to the immediate left of the subject in an inverted sentence:\nInversion and negation with verba dicendi may co-occur only if the reporting clause itself is not inverted: \nOther constraints involve subject position, DP direct objects, and movement, among others.\n\nGrammaticalization is the attribution of grammatical character to a previously independent, autonomous word. There is significant cross-linguistic evidence of verba dicendi grammaticalizing into functional syntactic categories. For instance, in some African and Asian languages, these verbs may grammaticalize into a complementizer. In other East African languages, they may become markers of Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM). In English, the verb \"say\" in particular has also developed the function of a comment clause:\nIn these examples, the verb \"say\" fulfils many roles. In the first two examples (a & b), it means ‘suppose', or 'assume.’ In the third and fourth examples (c & d) the meaning of \"say\" could be paraphrased as 'for example', or 'approximately.' Example (e) uses \"say\" as an imperative introducing a question and connotes 'tell me/us.' \"Say\" may also function as an interjection to either focus attention on the speaker or to convey some emotional state such as surprise, regret, disbelief, etc. Finally, example (f) uses \"say\" in an emphatic, often imperative way. This function dates from the (early) Middle English period\n\nIn addition to basic verba dicendi and manner of speaking verbs, other forms are frequently used in spoken English. What sets these apart is that they are not, semantically speaking, reporting verbs at all. Such forms include \"be like\", \"be all\", and \"go\".\nThese forms, particularly \"be like\", have captured the attention of much linguistic study and documentation. Some research has addressed the syntax of these forms in quotation, which is highly problematic. For example, a verbum dicendi like \"say\" may refer to a previously quoted clause with \"it\". However, this is not possible with these innovative forms:\nNotice that these forms also don’t behave as basic verba dicendi in many other ways. Clefting, for example, produces ungrammatical forms like\nThey also can’t participate in inverted constructions like other manner-of-speaking verbs:\nSeveral other issues concerning these forms are the topic of much current study, including their diachrony, or change in use over time. \"Go\", for example, dates as far back as the eighteenth century, in contexts like \"go bang\", \"go crack\", \"go crash\", etc.\nResearch on these forms has also shown that \"be like\" in particular is associated with young people. However, this assumption is questioned on the basis of more recent findings which suggest that it is used by older speakers as well. It has also been largely attributed to female speakers, especially white females in California (Valley Girls). However, it is regularly used by speakers of both sexes, and in dialects of English outside of the US, including Canada and the UK. This is a topic of a great deal of research in current syntax and sociolinguistics.\n\nIn Japanese, verba dicendi (発話行為動詞 [hatsuwa koui doushi] 'speech act verb'), also referred to as verbs of communication or verbs of saying, include 言う\"iu/yuu\" 'say,' 聞く\"kiku\" 'ask,' 語る\"kataru\" 'relate,' 話す \"hanasu\" 'talk,' and 述べる \"noberu\" 'state.'Verba dicendi occur in the following construction: [_________] {と-\"to,\" て-\"tte\"} Verbum dicendi.と-\"to\" has been described as a complementizer and a quotative particle. Historically, use of と-\"to\" was restricted to reporting a statement by another speaker, but it has a much wider distribution in modern Japanese. In conversational Japanese, て-\"tte\" is more frequently used, and it has been described as a quotative particle, a hearsay particle, a quotation marker, and a quotative complementizer. In the above construction, the underlined phrase headed by {と-\"to\", て-\"tte\"} can be a word, a clause, a sentence, or an onomatopoetic expression.\n\nLike in English, verba dicendi in Japanese can introduce both direct and indirect speech as their complement. This is contrasted with verbs of thinking, which only introduce indirect speech. An exception to this is a verb of thinking 思う \"omou\" 'think,' which can introduce a speech that is not uttered but takes place in one's mind as direct speech in the simple past tense; this use of 思う \"omou\" 'think' is called a \"quasi-communicative act.\"\n\nIn Japanese, a complement of a verbum dicendi can be ambiguous between direct and indirect readings, meaning that the distinction can only be inferred from the discourse context. For example, in (1), [boku ga Tookyoo e iku], which is in the complement of the verb 言う \"iu\" (past tense: \"itta\"), can be interpreted as either direct speech (2)a or indirect speech (2)b.(1) 太郎は僕が東京へ行くと言った。Taroo wa [boku ga Tookyoo e ik-u] to it-taTaro TOP I(MALE) NOM Tokyo to go-PRS QUOT say-PST.(2)a. Taro said, \"I will go to Tokyo.\"(2)b. Taro said that I would go to Tokyo.\n\nOne reason for this direct-indirect ambiguity in Japanese is that Japanese indirect speech does not involve \"backshifting of tense\" observed in other languages including English. In the English translations, the direct speech in (2)a has \"will\" in the tense of the embedded clause, but in (2)b, it has been \"backshifted\" to \"would\" so that it matches the past tense of the matrix clause. Tense does not serve as a diagnostics of direct-indirect distinctions in Japanese.\n\nAnother reason for the ambiguity is that both direct and indirect quotes are introduced by {と-\"to\", て-\"tte\"} in Japanese. Hence, presence of an overt complementizer cannot disambiguate direct and indirect speech either.\n\nDisambiguation of direct and indirect speech in Japanese depends on switches in deictic expressions and expressions of \"speaker-addressee relationship.\" One language-specific diagnostics of direct speech is so-called \"addressee-oriented expressions,\" which trigger a presupposition that there is an addressee in the discourse context. Some examples are listed below:sentence final particles: さ -\"sa\" 'let me tell you'; ね -\"ne\" 'you know'; よ -\"yo\" 'I tell you'; わ -\"wa\" 'I want you to know'imperative forms: 「走れ！」\"hashire\" 'Run!’polite verbs/polite auxiliary verbs: です \"desu\"; ございます \"gozaimasu\"; ます\"masu\"For example, in (3), [Ame da yo] in the complement of the verb 言う \"iu\" (past tense: \"itta\") is unambiguously interpreted as direct speech because of the sentence final particle よ -\"yo\" 'I tell you.'(3) 太郎は花子に「雨だよ」と言った。Taro wa Hanako ni [Ame da yo] to it-taTaro TOP Hanako DAT Rain COP \"yo\" QUOT say-PST'Taro said to Hanako, \"It is raining, I tell you.\"Similarly, in (4), [Ame desu] in the complement of the verb 言う \"iu\" (past tense: \"itta\") is unambiguously interpreted as direct speech because of the polite verb です \"desu.\"(4) 太郎は花子に「雨です」と言った。Taro wa Hanako ni [Ame desu] to it-taTaro TOP Hanako DAT Rain \"desu\" QUOT say-PST'Taro said to Hanako politely, \"It is raining.\"\n\nOne diagnostics of indirect speech in Japanese is presence of the reflexive pronoun 自分 \"zibun\" 'self.' It is a gender-neutral pronoun that uniformly refers to \"the private self,\" or an agent of thinking, as opposed to \"the public self,\" an agent of communicating, expressed by various personal pronouns (e.g. 僕 \"boku\" 'I(MALE)'), occupational roles (e.g. 先生 \"sensei\" 'teacher'), and kinship terms (e.g. お母さん \"okaasan\" 'mother').\n\nFor example, in (5), [zibun ga Tookyoo e iku] in the complement of the verb 言う \"iu\" (past tense: \"itta\") is unambiguously interpreted as indirect speech because of the presence of 自分 \"zibun\" 'self,' which is co-referential with 太郎 \"Taro\".(5) 太郎は自分が東京へ行くと言った。Taroo wa [zibun ga Tookyoo e iku] to it-taTaro TOP self NOM Tokyo to go QUOT say-PST.'Taro said that he would go to Tokyo.'Note that (5) only differs from (1) in the subject of the embedded clause; (5) has 自分 \"zibun\" 'self' and (1) has 僕 \"boku\" 'I(MALE).'\n\nIt has been reported that some sentences in Japanese have characteristics of both direct and indirect modes simultaneously. This phenomenon is called \"semi-indirect mode\" or \"quasi-direct mode.\" It is also observed in a reported speech, and Kuno (1988) has termed it \"blended discourse.\" (6) is an example of blended discourse.(6) 太郎は奴のうちに何時に来いと言ったのか。Taro wa [yatu-no uti-ni nanzi-ni ko-i] to it-ta no ka?Taro TOP [he-GEN house-DAT what.time-DAT come-IMP] QUOT say-PST Q Q'What time did Taro say, [come to his house ______]?'[yatu-no uti-ni nanzi-ni ko-i] in the complement of the verb 言う \"iu\" (past tense: \"itta\") appears to be direct speech because it has an imperative verb form 来い \"ko-i\" 'Come!'.\n\nOn the other hand, the third person pronoun 奴 \"yatu\" 'he' inside the embedded clause is co-referential with the matrix subject 太郎 \"Taro.\" This means that this deictic expression inside the embedded clause is interpreted in the context in which the whole sentence (6) is uttered; cross-linguistically, this is considered to be a property of indirect speech.\n\nMoreover, the wh-phrase 何時 \"nanzi\" 'what time' inside the embedded clause is taking matrix scope, meaning that it interacts with the matrix clause to influence the meaning of the whole sentence. This sentence means that, for example, 太郎 \"Taro\" had said \"Come to my house at ten o'clock!,\" and the utterer of (6), not knowing the content of \"ten o'clock,\" is requesting for this information. Availability of this meaning is an indication of indirect speech because if the embedded clause was direct speech, it would be syntactically opaque.\n"}
