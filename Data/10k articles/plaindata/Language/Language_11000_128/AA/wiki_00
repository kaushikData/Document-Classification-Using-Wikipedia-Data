{"id": "53413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53413", "title": "Buggery", "text": "Buggery\n\nThe British English term buggery is very close in meaning to the term sodomy, often used interchangeably in law and popular speech. It may also be a specific common law offence encompassing both sodomy and bestiality.\n\nThe modern English word \"bugger\" is derived from the French term \"\", that evolved from the Latin \"Bulgarus\" or \"Bulgarian\". The Catholic Church used the word to describe members of a religious sect known as the Bogomils, who originated in medieval Bulgaria in the 10th Century and spread throughout Western Europe by the 15th Century. The Church used it as a term of offence against a group they considered heretical. The first use of the word \"buggery\" appears in Middle English in 1330 where it is associated with \"abominable heresy\"; though the sexual sense of \"bugger\" is not recorded until 1555.\n\"The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology\" quotes a similar form: \"bowgard\" (and \"bouguer\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. Albigensian\". Webster's \"Third New International Dictionary\" gives the only meaning of the word \"bugger\" as a sodomite, \"from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical\".\n\n\"Bugger\" is still commonly used in modern English as an exclamation while \"buggery\" is synonymous with the act of sodomy.\n\nIn English law \"buggery\" was first used in the Buggery Act 1533, while Section 61 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, entitled \"Sodomy and Bestiality\", defined punishments for \"the abominable Crime of Buggery, committed either with Mankind or with any Animal\". The definition of \"buggery\" was not specified in these or any statute, but rather established by judicial precedent. Over the years the courts have defined buggery as including either\nbut not any other form of \"unnatural intercourse\", the implication being that anal sex with an animal would not constitute buggery. Such a case has not, to date, come before the courts of a common law jurisdiction in any reported decision. In the 1817 case of \"Rex v. Jacobs\", the Crown Court ruled that oral intercourse, even with an underage and/or non-consenting animal, did not constitute buggery or sodomy.\n\nAt common law consent was not a defence nor was the fact that the parties were married. In the UK, the punishment for buggery was reduced from hanging to life imprisonment by the Offences against the Person Act 1861. As with the crime of rape, buggery required that penetration must have occurred, but ejaculation is not necessary.\n\nMost common law jurisdictions have now modified the law to permit anal sex between consenting adults. In England, the first relaxation of the law came from the Wolfenden Report, published in 1957. The key proposal of the report was that \"homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence\". However, the law was not changed until 1967, when the Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalised consensual \"homosexual acts\" as long as only two men were involved, both were over 21 and the acts happened in private. However, the Act concerned acts between men only, and anal sex between men and women remained an offence until 1994, when the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 decriminalised consensual anal sex between a man and a woman, if both were over 18. The Act also reduced the age at which two men could engage in anal sex to 18, but it was not until 2000, with the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, that the age of consent for anal sex was reduced to 16 for men and women. In 2003, the Sexual Offences Act significantly reformed English law in relation to sexual offences, introducing a new range of offences relating to underage and non-consensual sexual activity that were concerned with the act that occurred, rather than the sex/gender or sexual orientation of those committing it.\n\nBuggery in as much as it related to sexual intercourse with animal (bestiality) remained untouched until the Sexual Offences Act 2003, when it was replaced with a new offence of \"intercourse with an animal\".\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 abolished the offence of \"buggery between persons\". For some years prior to 1993, criminal prosecution had not been made for buggery between consenting adults. The 1993 Act created an offence of \"buggery with a person under the age of 17 years\", penalised similar to statutory rape, which also had 17 years as the age of consent. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 replaced this offence with \"defilement of a child\", encompassing both \"sexual intercourse\" and \"buggery\". Buggery with an animal is still unlawful under Section 69 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. In 2012 a man was convicted of this offence for supplying a dog in 2008 to a woman who had intercourse with it and died; he received a suspended sentence and was required to sign the sex offender registry, ending his career as a bus driver.\n\nHong Kong did so retroactively in 1990, barring prosecution for \"crimes against nature\" committed before the \"Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance 1990\" entered into force except those that would still have constituted a crime if they had been done thereafter.\n\n"}
{"id": "199162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199162", "title": "Conducting", "text": "Conducting\n\nConducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert. It has been defined as \"the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture.\" The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score created by a composer in a manner which is reflective of the specific indications within that score, set the tempo, ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to \"shape\" the phrasing where appropriate. To convey their ideas and interpretation, conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers. A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.\n\nThe conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments or voices. Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (see concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a \"count in\"). However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.\n\nConductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, choirs, concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors.\n\nThe principal conductor of an orchestra or opera company is sometimes referred to as a \"music director\" or \"chief conductor\", or by the German words \"Kapellmeister\" or \"Dirigent\". Conductors of choirs or choruses are sometimes referred to as \"choral director,\" \"chorus master,\" or \"choirmaster,\" particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra. Conductors of concert bands, military bands, marching bands and other bands may hold the title of \"band director\", \"bandmaster\", or \"drum major\". Respected senior conductors are sometimes referred to by the Italian word, \"maestro\" (\"master\" as in \"one who has mastered the art\").\n\nAn early form of conducting is cheironomy, the use of hand gestures to indicate melodic shape. This has been practiced at least as far back as the Middle Ages. In the Christian church, the person giving these symbols held a staff to signify his role, and it seems that as music became rhythmically more complex, the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat, acting as an early form of baton.\n\nIn the 17th century, other devices to indicate the passing of time came into use. Rolled up sheets of paper, smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period. The large staff was responsible for the death of Jean-Baptiste Lully, who injured his foot with one while conducting a Te Deum for the King's recovery from illness. The wound became gangrenous and Lully refused amputation, whereupon the gangrene spread to his leg and he died two months later.\n\nIn instrumental music throughout the 18th century, a member of the ensemble usually acted as the conductor. This was sometimes the concertmaster, who could use his bow as a baton, or a lutenist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat. It was common to conduct from the harpsichord in pieces that had a basso continuo part. In opera performances, there were sometimes two conductors – the keyboard player was in charge of the singers, and the principal violinist or leader was in charge of the orchestra.\n\nOn Fri, 30 Sep 1791 in Vienna, Mozart's opera Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute) premiered at the Theater auf der Wieden (also known as the “Wiednertheater”), with Mozart himself conducting the orchestra, according to documents and publicity posters from that time.\n\nIn 1798, Joseph Haydn conducted the premiere of Creation with his hands and a baton while \"Kapellmeister\nWeigl [sat] at the fortepiano.\"\n\nBy the early 19th century (ca. 1820), it became the norm to have a dedicated conductor, who did not also play an instrument during the performance. While some orchestras protested the introduction of the conductor, since they were used to having a concertmaster or keyboard player act as leader, eventually the role of a conductor was established. The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common, as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper. Among the earliest notable conductors were Louis Spohr, Carl Maria von Weber, Louis-Antoine Jullien and Felix Mendelssohn, all of whom were also composers. Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use in the 2010s. Prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include Pierre Boulez, Kurt Masur, James Conlon, Yuri Temirkanov, Leopold Stokowski, Vasily Safonov, Eugene Ormandy (for a period), and Dimitri Mitropoulos.\n\nThe composers Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject. Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor. Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat. Predecessors who focused on conducting include François Habeneck, who founded the Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire in 1828, though Berlioz was later to be alarmed at Habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal. Pianist and composer Franz Liszt was also a conductor.\n\nWagner's one-time champion Hans von Bülow (1830–1894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of Franz Liszt, whose daughter Cosima he married – although she was to abandon him for Wagner. Liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting, who attained remarkable performances).\n\nBülow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra (\"sectional rehearsal\"). In his posts as head of (sequentially) the Bavarian State Opera, Meiningen Court Orchestra, and Berlin Philharmonic he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like Richard Strauss, who at the age of 20 served as his assistant, and Felix Weingartner, who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards. Composer Gustav Mahler was also a noted conductor.\n\nThe next generation of conductors brought technical standards to new levels; perhaps most notable was the Hungarian-born Arthur Nikisch (1855–1922), who succeeded Bülow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895. He had previously served as head of the Leipzig Opera, Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, and was to serve as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra. Nikisch premiered important works by Anton Bruckner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who greatly admired his work; Johannes Brahms, after hearing him conduct his Fourth Symphony, said it was \"quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better.\"\n\nNikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra. He also made one of the earliest recordings of a complete symphony: the Beethoven Fifth with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913. Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film – alas, silently. The film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra; such later conductors as Fritz Reiner stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own.\n\nConductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts. Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes. They were the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini (1867–1957) and the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler (1886–1954). Toscanini played in orchestras under Giuseppe Verdi and made his debut conducting \"Aida\" in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor. He is to this day regarded by such authorities as James Levine as the greatest of all Verdi conductors. But Toscanini's repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like Bülow or, before him, Wagner. Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.\n\nFurtwängler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo – but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly. He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist Heinrich Schenker, who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and resolutions in a piece, a strength of Furtwängler's conducting. Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtwängler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.\nThe two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtwängler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way). In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized. Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like Leopold Stokowski (1882–1977), Otto Klemperer (1885–1973), Herbert von Karajan (1908–1989) and Leonard Bernstein (1918–1990) – incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame – had widely varied techniques.\n\nKarajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s–80s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955–89) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the New York Philharmonic (1957–69), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe. Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements. Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax. As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 – performing Mahler's Symphony No. 9 – he tried to get the orchestra to produce an \"ugly\" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).\n\nBoth Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways. Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them, he did not talk. Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him – he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc – but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.\n\nIn the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique – particularly with the right hand and the baton – became increasingly standardized. Conductors like Willem Mengelberg in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely, and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time. A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid. Nonetheless, conductors' techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.\n\nWomen conductors were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like , Marin Alsop and Simone Young are to be seen conducting leading orchestras. Alsop was appointed music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 2007 – the first woman ever appointed to head a major US orchestra – and also of the Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo in 2012, and Alsop was the first woman to conduct on the last night of The Proms. Young scored similar firsts when she became head of the Hamburg State Opera and Philharmoniker Hamburg in 2005; she is also the first woman conductor to record the Ring Cycle of Richard Wagner. \"The Guardian\" called conducting \"one of the last glass ceilings in the music industry\". A 2013 article stated that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the National Opéra in Paris. \"\"Bachtrack\" reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women.\"\n\nWhile Mexico has produced several major international conductors, Alondra de la Parra has become the first Mexican-born woman to attain distinction in the profession. Similarly, Asian origin has become unremarkable, because of the international successes of conductors from the Far East such as Seiji Ozawa, who was the Boston Symphony Orchestra's music director from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts in San Francisco and Toronto, and Myung-Whun Chung, who has held major posts in Germany and France and now is bringing the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra to international attention. There is still under-representation of artists of black origin in the conducting profession, but there have been notable exceptions, such as Henry Lewis, Dean Dixon, James DePreist, Paul Freeman, and Michael Morgan. For more information on black conductors, see Black conductors. According to a 2004 article in \"The Guardian\", \"black conductors are rare in the classical music world and even in symphony orchestras it is unusual to see more than one or two black musicians.\"\n\nConducting is a means of communicating artistic directions to performers during a performance. Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music. Communication is non-verbal during a performance, however in rehearsal frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played. During rehearsals, the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section. In amateur orchestras, the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians' attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes.\n\nConducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression (tempo, dynamics, articulation) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble. The ability to communicate nuances of phrasing and expression through gestures is also beneficial. Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the score, but may sometimes be spontaneous.\n\nA distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. Typically, orchestral conductors use a baton more often than choral conductors. The grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor.\n\nAt the beginning of a piece of music, the conductor raises his hands (or hand if he only uses a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin. This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching. The conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds, strings, etc.) or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready. In some choral works, the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes. Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music. The preparatory beat before the orchestra or choir begins is the upbeat. The beat of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand, with or without a baton. The hand traces a shape in the air in every bar (measure) depending on the time signature, indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion. The images show the most common beat patterns, as seen from the conductor's point of view.\n\nThe downbeat indicates the first beat of the bar, and the upbeat indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar. The instant at which the beat occurs is called the \"\" (plural: \"\" or \"ictuses\"), and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction. In some instances, \"ictus\" is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a music stand where a baton is tapped at each ictus. The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the \"preparation\", and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the \"\" (the German word for bar, measure and beat).\n\nIf the tempo is slow or slowing, or if the time signature is compound, a conductor will sometimes indicate \"subdivisions\" of the beats. The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.\n\nChanges to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat. To carry out and to control a rallentando (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions.\n\nWhile some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach. The second hand can be used for cueing the entrances of individual players or sections, and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.\n\nDuring an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.\n\nThere is a difference between the \"textbook\" definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual performance practice in professional orchestras. With an abrupt, loud sforzando chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly \"after\" the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.\n\nDynamics are indicated in various ways. The dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements, larger shapes representing louder sounds. Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a crescendo; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a diminuendo. Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances.\n\nDynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume. To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.\n\nThe indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called \"cueing\". A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful in the case of a pedal point with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by \"engaging\" the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible \"sniff\" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.\n\nArticulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for staccato, to long and fluid for legato. Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo. Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side. A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up. The end of a note, called a \"cutoff\" or \"release\", may be indicated by a circular motion, the closing of the palm, or the pinching of finger and thumb. A release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness.\n\nConductors aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor. Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players.\n\nIn some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see). For example, in a piece that the conductor will beat \"in two\" (two ictus points or beats per bar, as if it were ), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his chest.\n\nIn most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite. This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement. String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief. Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed. In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to E clarinet). If the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons, this is called attacca. The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.\n\nThe roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles. In some cases, a conductor will also be the musical director of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on. A senior conductor may attend some or all of the auditions for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards. Some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor. The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.\n\nSome conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts. On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts. While a handful of conductors have become well-known celebrities, such as Leonard Bernstein, most are only known within the classical music scene.\n\nClassical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems of instruction and training. Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities. Conservatories, which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience. Universities offer a range of conducting programs, including courses in conducting as part of bachelor's degrees, a small number of Master of Music degrees in conducting, and an even smaller number of Doctor of Musical Arts degrees in conducting.\n\nIn addition, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music. Aspiring conductors need to obtain a broad education about the history of music, including the major periods of classical music and regarding music theory. Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the pipe organ, a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct. Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.\n\nIn 2014, orchestra conductors typically hold a master's degree in music and choir conductors in the US typically hold a bachelor's degree in music. Bachelor's degrees (referred to as B.Mus. or B.M) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus. stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.\n\nAnother topic that conducting students study is the languages used in Classical music opera. Orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir. As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context. The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra. As such, a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections.\n\nMaster of music degrees (M.mus.) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting.\n\nDoctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a terminal degree, and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as youth orchestras, school orchestras and community orchestras.\n\nA small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting. These individuals often have achieved renown as instrumental or vocal performers, and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing). Another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).\n\nThe average salary of conductors in the US in 2014 was $48,180. A 3% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 to 2024, a slower than average growth rate.\n\n\n\n"}

A counterbore hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a socket head cap screw, is required to sit flush with or below the level of a workpiece's surface. \n\nWhereas a counterbore is a \"flat-bottomed\" enlargement of a smaller coaxial hole, a countersink is a \"conical\" enlargement of such. A spotface often takes the form of a very shallow counterbore. \n\nAs mentioned above, the cutters that produce counterbores are often also called counterbores; sometimes, to avoid ambiguity, the term counterbore cutter is used instead. \n\nA counterbore hole is usually used when the head of a fastener, such as a hex head or socket head capscrew, is required to be flush with or below the level of a workpiece's surface.\n\nFor a spotface, material is removed from a surface to make it flat and smooth, usually for a fastener or a bearing. Spotfacing is usually required on workpieces that are forged or cast. A tool referred to as a counterbore is typically used to cut the spotface, although an endmill may also be used. Only enough material is removed to make the surface flat.\n\nA counterbore is also used to create a perpendicular surface for a fastener head on a non-perpendicular surface. If this is not feasible then a self-aligning nut may be required.\n\nBy comparison, a countersink makes a conical hole and is used to seat a flathead screw.\n\nStandards exist for the sizes of counterbores, especially for fastener head seating areas. These standards can vary between corporations and between standards organizations. For example, in Boeing Design Manual BDM-1327 section 3.5, the nominal diameter of the spotfaced surface is the same as the nominal size of the cutter, and is equal to the flat seat diameter plus twice the fillet radius. This is in contrast to the ASME Y14.5-2009 definition of a spotface, which is equal to the flat seat diameter.\n\nCounterbores are made with standard dimensions for a certain size of screw or are produced in sizes that are not related to any particular screw size. In either case, the tip of the counterbore has a reduced diameter section referred to as the pilot, a feature essential to assuring concentricity between the counterbore and the hole being counterbored. Counterbores matched to specific screw sizes generally have integral pilots that fit the clearance hole diameter associated with a particular screw size (e.g., .191 inches for a number 10 machine screw). Counterbores that are not related to a specific screw size are designed to accept a removable pilot, allowing any given counterbore size to be adapted to a variety of hole sizes. The pilot matters little when running the cutter in a milling setup where rigidity is assured and hole center location is already achieved via X-Y positioning.\n\nThe uppermost counterbore tools shown in the image are the same device. The smaller top item is an insert, the middle shows another three-fluted counterbore insert, assembled in the holder. The shank of this holder is a Morse taper, although there are other machine tapers that are used in the industry. The lower counterbore is designed to fit into a drill chuck, and being smaller, is economical to make as one piece.\n\n"}

Democratic Collective Centralism supports this belief whilst combining it with Collectivism.\n\nThe key belief within Democratic Collective Centralism is Collectivism, the idea of prioritizing the group rather than yourself or your family. These prioritizations could be goals, outcomes, rights and so on.\n\nThis belief has been criticized for being inhuman or unnatural as people will naturally build preferences towards individuals and parties. Socialists have argued the only way for this to work is to have common ownership.\n\nThe main or commonly spoken role which Collectivism plays within Democratic Collective Centralism is to shrink the wealth inequality within the public by having the significant majority of the population within the middle-class. This is done by the government enforcing strict tax laws within the state which effects low incomes very minorly however, large incomers significantly. The logic or reasoning behind the act is the belief that the money will have a better use if it's being used on the country's needs rather than materialistic needs. This relates to Collectivism as the money is being used for the public or the whole rather than individual unnecessary materialistic needs.\n\nThis is viewed as a major factor within the ideology because of some country's One percent progressively owning very large sums of money whilst the middle class are progressively becoming less wealthy.\n\nDemocratic Collective Centralism also holds the belief that when electing an individual you must vote for who you believe is the best for the state rather than who's best for you. This belief is practically impossible to enforce however, is seen as a moral.\n\nLastly, collectivism wants it's people to prioritize the country's problems. What's meant by 'country's problems' could be the environment, science, unemployment and so on... The 'country's problems' can change dependent on the current situation. However, the key aspect to this belief is how citizens should view these problems. The people or citizens should believe in these beliefs as they're important for the country's health or survival which again links to Collectivism because of the aspect in prioritizing the country's problems.\n\nDemocratic Collective Centralism supports free market of all private organizations with one simple guideline. As long as the private organization is not intentionally damaging the country's or state's health for profit reasons, they're freely allowed to carry out all forms of legal business upon the public. However, if the private organization is found to be unintentionally damaging the country's or state's health when there is an option not to damage the country's or state's health; the government will step in and force that switch. All of this falls under collectivism because when the government acts, there reasoning will be for benefiting the country or state.\n"}
{"id": "20841683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20841683", "title": "Double escrow", "text": "Double escrow\n\nDouble escrow is a set of real estate transactions involving two contracts of sale for the same property, to two different back-to-back buyers, at the same or two different prices, arranged to close on the same day. At close of escrow, all participants, lenders, sellers, buyers and brokers are informed of all parties involved and all monies that change hands.\n\nFor example, a double escrow might be arranged in which Alpha sells Greenacre to Beta, the sale to close at 10:00 am this morning; and Beta then immediately sells Greenacre to Gamma at 2:00 pm this afternoon. Because the two escrows are arranged to close back-to-back on the same day, they are regarded as one \"double escrow.\"\n\nIf the underlying purpose of the double escrow is legal, the double escrow will be legal. If the double escrow is undertaken for a criminal purpose, it will not be legal. Otherwise, whether legal or not, a double escrow may not be physically possible.\n\nBy definition, both escrows must close on the same day, or it is not \"double\" escrow but two single escrows. The second sale cannot close until the deed from the first sale is recorded, which means the deed must be recorded on the same day that both closings happen. If a county clerk or recorder's office has a 10:00 am deadline for same-day recording, and if the first sale does not close until after that deadline; then the deed will not be recorded until the next day, and the second escrow cannot close on the same day as the first. This is one situation in which double escrow is impossible.\n\nAnother, possible more common reason for double escrow to be impossible is that the county clerk's office might not do same-day recording of deeds, especially if the county is understaffed. Many counties have a time lag of several days to several weeks (even a month or more) between accepting a deed for recording and actual recording (as of the date it was received). In these jurisdictions, double escrow will be completely impossible because the back-to-back sales may not even close during the same week or month, let alone on the same day.\n"}

The feminine form, executrix, may sometimes be used. The role of an executor should not be confused with that of an executioner, a person who carries out a death sentence ordered by a government or other legal authority.\n\nAn executor is a legal term referring to a person named by the maker of a will or nominated by the testator to carry out the instructions of the will. Typically, the executor is the person responsible for offering the will for probate, although it is not required that they fulfill this. The executor's duties also include disbursing property to the beneficiaries as designated in the will, obtaining information of potential heirs, collecting and arranging for payment of debts of the estate and approving or disapproving creditors' claims.\n\nAn executor will make sure estate taxes are calculated, necessary forms are filed, and tax payments are made. They will also assist the attorney with the estate. Additionally, the executor acts as a legal conveyor who designates where the donations will be sent using the information left in \"bequests, \"whether they be sent to charity or other organizations. In most circumstances, the executor is the representative of the estate for all purposes, and has the ability to sue or be sued on behalf of the estate. The executor holds legal title to the estate property, but may not use the title or property for their own benefit, unless permitted by the terms of the will.\n\nA person who deals with a deceased person's property without proper authority is known as an executor \"de son tort\". Such a person's actions may subsequently be ratified by the lawful executors or administrators if the actions do not contradict the substantive provisions of the deceased's will or the rights of heirs at law.\n\nWhen there is no will, a person is said to have died intestate—\"without testimony.\" As a result, there is no tangible \"testimony\" to follow, and hence there can be no executor. If there is no will or the executors named in a will do not wish to act, an administrator of the deceased's estate may instead be appointed. The generic term for executors or administrators is personal representative. In England and Wales, when a person dies intestate in a nursing home, and has no family members who can be traced, those responsible for their care automatically become their executors.\nUnder Scottish law, a personal representative of any kind is referred to as an executor, using \"executor nominate\" to refer to an executor and \"executor dative\" to an administrator.\n\nIn some countries, such as the United States, an executor is automatically entitled to compensation for his or her services, although this amount varies dramatically by jurisdiction. Unless specifically set by the will, this compensation is often determined by what is considered ″reasonable″ for the effort involved, although in a number of jurisdictions, the amount is instead set as a percentage of the overall estate. For example, in California the executor is entitled to 4% of the first $100K of estate value, 3% of the next $100K, and so on. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the executor is \"not\" automatically entitled to compensation, although compensation can be directed within the will or on application to a court.\n\nIn recent years, custom \"executors' insurance\" policies have entered the marketplace. These are currently available in countries including Canada, England, and Wales. They are often taken up by non-professional executors—typically friends or family of the deceased—who may be worried about potentially making an error during the probate process and/or uncomfortable about exposing themselves to unlimited personal financial and legal liability. Many find such cover an attractive proposition as the vast majority of wills allow reasonable expenses, such as the cost of the policy, to be reclaimed from the deceased's estate.\n\n\n"}

Colonel Yves Picot is said to have coined the term when he was refused passing a checkpoint to a gathering for the war-disabled.\n\nTrench warfare protected the bodies but left the heads exposed. The introduction of the steel helmet in 1915 made head shots more 'survivable', but this reduction of mortality meant a mutilated life for thousands.\n\nAt the start of the war those wounded to the head were generally not considered able to survive and they would not usually be 'helped first'. This changed in the course of the war, as progress was made in medical practices like oral and maxillofacial surgery and most notably in the new field of plastic surgery. Surgeons conducted experiments with bone, cartilage and tissue transplants and the likes of Hippolyte Morestin, Harold Gillies and Léon Dufourmentel made enormous advances. Because of the experimental character of this surgery some chose to remain as they were and others could just not be helped yet. Some of the latter were helped by all kinds of new prosthetics to make them look more or less 'normal'.\n\nAn estimated 4.2 million French were wounded, 300,000 of whom were classified as 'mutilated'. Of those some 15,000 can be called \"gueules cassées\". Right after the war those facially disfigured were not considered war veterans and exempt from support and veteran's benefits, but that changed later. In 1921 the \"Union des Blessés de la Face et de la tête\" (association of the wounded to the face and the head) was formed. The Colonel Picot mentioned above was one of its founders and a later president of the association.

Their area of habitation in and around the village of Hertevin (called Hertevinler in Turkish and Härtəvən in Kurdish), near the town of Pervari in Siirt Province is at the very northeastern extreme of the area where Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages were traditionally spoken. Thus, Hértevin is a peripheral dialect that has developed quite differently from related languages.\n\nAll Hértevin speakers are bilingual in Kurdish, and many also speak other languages. The Syriac alphabet is used for writing, but almost no literature in the Hértevin dialect exists. Church liturgy is in Syriac.\n\nIts major phonetic feature is the loss of the voiceless velar fricative \"x\", which has become a voiceless pharyngeal fricative, \"ħ\". The original voiceless pharyngeal fricative has retained that pronunciation. In all the other dialects of eastern Neo-Aramaic the opposite is true: the voiceless pharyngeal fricative has been lost and merged with the voiceless velar fricative.\n\nAnother feature of Hértevin Neo-Aramaic is its set of demonstratives. As with other languages of the eastern group, Hértevin makes no distinction between 'this' and 'that', and uses a single set of pronouns to cover both meanings: āwa (m. sg.), āya (f. sg.) and āni (pl.). However, unlike the other languages, Hértevin has developed an emphatic form of these pronouns that indicates 'this one right here': ōhā, ēhā and anhī.\n\nAlthough belonging to the eastern, or northeastern, group of Neo-Aramaic dialects, Hértevin shares some features with the Turoyo language, of the central group, originating from nearby Mardin Province.\n\n\n\n"}

However, the term is still used to designate a politician who either has left the Conservative Party or never joined it, so is independent of it, but who nevertheless identifies as a Conservative.\n\nLord Robert Cecil was an Independent Conservative in the House of Commons between 1911 and 1923, after he won the 1911 by-election for Hitchin, Hertfordshire. At the 1945 general election, John Mackie and Daniel Lipson were both elected to the Commons as Independent Conservatives.\n\nAndrew Hunter was elected as a Conservative MP in 2001; he left the party when selected in 2002 as a candidate for the Democratic Unionist Party in the 2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election. Hunter sat as an Independent Conservative MP until joining the DUP Westminster parliamentary party in 2004.\n\nLord Stevens of Ludgate sat in the House of Lords as an Independent Conservative between 2004 and 2012.\nDerek Conway sat as an Independent Conservative after he lost the whip in 2008, and did not contest the 2010 general election.\n\nNadine Dorries was suspended from the Conservative Party after taking part in the television competition \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" in November 2012, before regaining the Conservative whip in May 2013.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Zac Goldsmith resigned from the House of Commons over the planned expansion of Heathrow Airport, triggering a by-election, which Goldsmith contested as an Independent, but without opposition from the Conservative Party. He was described as an Independent Conservative.\n\nIndependent Conservative members of parliament have also sat in the House of Commons of Canada, with a similar designation. In the 19th century, prior to the solidification of the party system, it was common in Canada for Independent Conservative and Independent Liberal members to be elected, sometimes defeating official Conservative or Liberal candidates.\n\nJoseph Sasseville Roy was elected as an Independent Conservative at the 1940 federal election. He had declined to run as an official Conservative, due to his disagreement with the party's policy on conscription, which was unpopular in Quebec. Henri Courtemanche was elected as an \"Independent Progressive Conservative\" in Labelle in 1957 and subsequently rejoined the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Maurice Allard was elected to the Commons as an \"Independent Progressive Conservative\" in Sherbrooke at the 1965 federal election, defeating the official Progressive Conservative candidate. A former Progressive Conservative politician, Allard had quit the party in 1963 due to his opposition to its leader, John George Diefenbaker.\n\nSince then, it has been more usual for Independent Conservatives at the national level to be Conservatives who have voluntarily resigned the party whip or who have been expelled from the party. Bill Casey sat in the House of Commons as an \"Independent Progressive Conservative\" after he was expelled from the Conservative Party of Canada caucus for stating that the Conservative government's 2007 budget had violated the Atlantic Accord. Casey was re-elected at the federal election of 2008 with almost 70 per cent of the vote.\n\nPatrick Brazeau is a current Independent Conservative Senator, but he has been expelled from sitting in the Senate due his arrest for assault. Pamela Wallin is a current Independent Conservative Senator, who was removed from caucus due to spending scandal. In 2013, Brent Rathgeber became an Independent Conservative MP for St. Albert - Edmonton after leaving the Conservative Party caucus, citing that the Prime Minister's Office had authoritarian-type power of the government.

Its objective is to examine topics related to the northern minorities in the Soviet Union, and to prepare teachers for the northern boarding schools. One of the central figures involved in the research institute was Vladimir Bogoraz.\n\nThe institute was founded in 1930, as four years previously it had become possible to study the languages of the northern peoples in their own right at the Institute for Eastern Studies at Leningrad State University. By the end of 1929, the institute's teachers had joined forces to create the Unified Northern Alphabet () for use by the linguistic minorities living in the north of the Soviet Union. The alphabet consisted of 32 Latin-based letters, some of which were equipped with diacritics. For practical reasons, i.e., typographical reasons, a move to rid the alphabet of graphemes using diacritics was made and one year later a new version was ready. On December 13, 1930, the Presidium of the Scientific Investigation Association at the institute presented a version of the Unified Northern Alphabet to the Scientific Council of the USSR’s Central Committee on Alphabet Adaptation (). The same body discussed the draft again on December 18 and it was approved on February 23, 1931. The scientific section of Narkompros approved the draft in May the same year. \n\nThe alphabet consisted of 39 letters: 29 consonants and 10 vowels. In addition, some letters were marked with diacritics to show palatalization, length and aspiration.\n\nAn intensive and systematic publishing campaign was launched immediately after the alphabet had been formally approved. From 1939 to 1949, approximately 300 experts were employed by the institute.\n\n\"The finalisation of principles for creation of a literary public institution for the peoples of the north\" came at the first pan-Russian conference. Delegates to the conference (which was held at the INS ni Leningrad) were representatives for Narkompros, Komitet Severa v/Presidium VCIK, CK Novogo Alfavita SSSR i RSFSR, and the publisher Učpedgiz. In the work conducted at the conference, there were participants from the national northern okrugs, for the local Northern Committees, for CK VLKSM, for the soviet Academy of Sciences, for the Historical-linguistic institute in Leningrad, and for the Northern department at the Leningrad Herzen Pedagogical Institute. The preparation work was done at INS.\n\nThe conference decided to create orthographies for a total of 16 languages and to have books available for the 15th anniversary of the revolution:\n\n\nVarious books, including primers and math textbooks, were published using this alphabet. The first work published using the new orthography was a book on terminology specific to these areas.\n\nThe institute was run in its original form from 1930 until 1941. Between 1942 and 1945, the institute was located in Omsk, after which it moved back to Leningrad as a part of the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Leningrad State University. Since 1948, the institute has been a part of the Herzen University, to which it still belongs today.\n\n"}

{"id": "46565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46565", "title": "L-system", "text": "L-system\n\nAn L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial \"axiom\" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht. Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms and can be used to generate self-similar fractals.\n\nAs a biologist, Lindenmayer worked with yeast and filamentous fungi and studied the growth patterns of various types of bacteria, such as the cyanobacteria \"Anabaena catenula\". Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.\n\nThe recursive nature of the L-system rules leads to self-similarity and thereby, fractal-like forms are easy to describe with an L-system. Plant models and natural-looking organic forms are easy to define, as by increasing the recursion level the form slowly 'grows' and becomes more complex. Lindenmayer systems are also popular in the generation of artificial life.\n\nL-system grammars are very similar to the semi-Thue grammar (see Chomsky hierarchy). L-systems are now commonly known as \"parametric\" L systems, defined as a tuple\n\nwhere\n\n\nThe rules of the L-system grammar are applied iteratively starting from the initial state. As many rules as possible are applied simultaneously, per iteration. The fact that each iteration employs as many rules as possible differentiates an L-system from a formal language generated by a formal grammar, which applies only one rule per iteration. If the production rules were to be applied only one at a time, one would quite simply generate a language, rather than an L-system. Thus, L-systems are strict subsets of languages.\n\nAn L-system is \"context-free\" if each production rule refers only to an individual symbol and not to its neighbours. Context-free L-systems are thus specified by a context-free grammar. If a rule depends not only on a single symbol but also on its neighbours, it is termed a \"context-sensitive\" L-system.\n\nIf there is exactly one production for each symbol, then the L-system is said to be \"deterministic\" (a deterministic context-free L-system is popularly called a \"D0L system\"). If there are several, and each is chosen with a certain probability during each iteration, then it is a \"stochastic\" L-system.\n\nUsing L-systems for generating graphical images requires that the symbols in the model refer to elements of a drawing on the computer screen. For example, the program \"Fractint\" uses turtle graphics (similar to those in the Logo programming language) to produce screen images. It interprets each constant in an L-system model as a turtle command.\n\nLindenmayer's original L-system for modelling the growth of algae.\n\nwhich produces:\n\n n=0: A start (axiom/initiator)\n\nThe result is the sequence of Fibonacci words. If we count the length of each string, we obtain the famous Fibonacci sequence of numbers (skipping the first 1, due to our choice of axiom):\n\nFor each string, if we count the \"k\"-th position from the left end of the string, the value is determined by whether a multiple of the golden ratio falls within the interval formula_1. The ratio of A to B likewise converges to the golden mean.\n\nThis example yields the same result (in terms of the length of each string, not the sequence of \"A\"s and \"B\"s) if the rule (\"A\" → \"AB\") is replaced with (\"A\" → \"BA\"), except that the strings are mirrored.\n\nThis sequence is a locally catenative sequence because formula_2, where formula_3 is the \"n\"-th generation.\n\n\nThe shape is built by recursively feeding the axiom through the production rules. Each character of the input string is checked against the rule list to determine which character or string to replace it with in the output string. In this example, a '1' in the input string becomes '11' in the output string, while '<nowiki>[</nowiki>' remains the same. Applying this to the axiom of '0', we get:\n\nWe can see that this string quickly grows in size and complexity. This string can be drawn as an image by using turtle graphics, where each symbol is assigned a graphical operation for the turtle to perform. For example, in the sample above, the turtle may be given the following instructions:\n\n\nThe push and pop refer to a LIFO stack (more technical grammar would have separate symbols for \"push position\" and \"turn left\"). When the turtle interpretation encounters a '<nowiki>[</nowiki>', the current position and angle are saved, and are then restored when the interpretation encounters a '<nowiki>]</nowiki>'. If multiple values have been \"pushed,\" then a \"pop\" restores the most recently saved values. Applying the graphical rules listed above to the earlier recursion, we get:\n\nLet \"A\" mean \"draw forward\" and \"B\" mean \"move forward\".\n\nThis produces the famous Cantor's fractal set on a real straight line R.\n\nA variant of the Koch curve which uses only right angles.\n\nHere, F means \"draw forward\", + means \"turn left 90°\", and − means \"turn right 90°\" (see turtle graphics).\n\nThe Sierpinski triangle drawn using an L-system.\n\nHere, F and G both mean \"draw forward\", + means \"turn left by angle\", and − means \"turn right by angle\".\n\nIt is also possible to approximate the Sierpinski triangle using a Sierpiński arrowhead curve L-system.\n\nHere, A and B both mean \"draw forward\", + means \"turn left by angle\", and − means \"turn right by angle\" (see turtle graphics).\nEvolution for \"n\" = 2, \"n\" = 4, \"n\" = 6, \"n\" = 8\n\nThe dragon curve drawn using an L-system.\n\nHere, F means \"draw forward\", − means \"turn left 90°\", and + means \"turn right 90°\". X and Y do not correspond to any drawing action and are only used to control the evolution of the curve.\n\nDragon curve for \"n\" = 10\n\nHere, F means \"draw forward\", − means \"turn left 25°\", and + means \"turn right 25°\". X does not correspond to any drawing action and is used to control the evolution of the curve. The square bracket \"[\" corresponds to saving the current values for position and angle, which are restored when the corresponding \"]\" is executed.\n\n[[File:Fractal-plant.svg|centre]]\n\nFractal plant for \"n\" = 6\n\nA number of elaborations on this basic L-system technique have been developed which can be used in conjunction with each other. Among these are [[stochastic grammar]]s, [[context sensitive grammar]]s, and parametric grammars.\n\nThe grammar model we have discussed thus far has been deterministic—that is, given any symbol in the grammar's alphabet, there has been exactly one production rule, which is always chosen, and always performs the same conversion. One alternative is to specify more than one production rule for a symbol, giving each a [[probability]] of occurring. For example, in the grammar of Example 2, we could change the rule for rewriting \"0\" from:\n\nto a probabilistic rule:\n\nUnder this production, whenever a \"0\" is encountered during string rewriting, there would be a 50% chance it would behave as previously described, and a 50% chance it would not change during production. When a stochastic grammar is used in an [[evolution]]ary context, it is advisable to incorporate a [[random]] seed into the [[genotype]], so that the stochastic properties of the image remain constant between generations.\n\nA context sensitive production rule looks not only at the symbol it is modifying, but the symbols on the string appearing before and after it. For instance, the production rule:\n\ntransforms \"a\" to \"aa\", but only If the \"a\" occurs between a \"b\" and a \"c\" in the input string:\n\nAs with stochastic productions, there are multiple productions to handle symbols in different contexts. If no production rule can be found for a given context, the identity production is assumed, and the symbol does not change on transformation. If context-sensitive and context-free productions both exist within the same grammar, the context-sensitive production is assumed to take precedence when it is applicable.\n\nIn a parametric grammar, each symbol in the alphabet has a parameter list associated with it. A symbol coupled with its parameter list is called a module, and a string in a parametric grammar is a series of modules. An example string might be:\n\nThe parameters can be used by the drawing functions, and also by the production rules. The production rules can use the parameters in two ways: first, in a conditional statement determining whether the rule will apply, and second, the production rule can modify the actual parameters. For example, look at:\n\nThe module a(x,y) undergoes transformation under this production rule if the conditional x=0 is met. For example, a(0,2) would undergo transformation, and a(1,2) would not.\n\nIn the transformation portion of the production rule, the parameters as well as entire modules can be affected. In the above example, the module b(x,y) is added to the string, with initial parameters (2,3). Also, the parameters of the already existing module are transformed. Under the above production rule,\n\nBecomes\n\nas the \"x\" parameter of a(x,y) is explicitly transformed to a \"1\" and the \"y\" parameter of a is incremented by one.\n\nParametric grammars allow line lengths and branching angles to be determined by the grammar, rather than the turtle interpretation methods. Also, if age is given as a parameter for a module, rules can change depending on the age of a plant segment, allowing animations of the entire life-cycle of the tree to be created.\n\nThe bi-directional model explicitly separates the symbolic rewriting system from the shape assignment. For example, the string rewriting process in the Example 2 (Fractal tree) is independent on how graphical operations are assigned to the symbols. In other words, an infinite number of draw methods are applicable to a given rewriting system.\n\nThe bi-directional model consists of 1) a forward process constructs the derivation tree with production rules, and 2) a backward process realizes the tree with shapes in a stepwise manner (from leaves to the root). Each inverse-derivation step involves essential geometric-topological reasoning. With this bi-directional framework, design constraints and objectives are encoded in the grammar-shape translation. In architectural design applications, the bi-directional grammar features consistent interior connectivity and a rich spatial hierarchy.\n\nThere are many open problems involving studies of L-systems. For example:\n\n\nL-systems on the [[real number|real line]] R:\n\nWell-known L-systems on a plane R are: \n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Formal languages]]\n[[Category:Computer graphics algorithms]]\n[[Category:Iterated function system fractals]]\n[[Category:Hungarian inventions]]"}

It forms the foundation for the widely accepted two-source theory, although a number of scholars support different forms of Marcan priority or reject it altogether.\n\nThe tradition handed down by the Church Fathers regarded Matthew as the first Gospel written. This view of Gospel origins, however, began to be challenged in the late 18th century, when Gottlob Christian Storr proposed in 1786 that Mark was the first to be written.\n\nStorr's idea met with little acceptance at first, with most scholars favoring either Matthaean priority, under the traditional Augustinian hypothesis or the Griesbach hypothesis, or a fragmentary theory (according to which, stories about Jesus were recorded in several smaller documents and notebooks and combined by the evangelists to create the Synoptic Gospels). Working within the fragmentary theory, Karl Lachmann in 1835 compared the Synoptic Gospels in pairs and noted that, while Matthew frequently agreed with Mark against Luke in the order of passages and Luke agreed frequently with Mark against Matthew, Matthew and Luke rarely agreed with each other against Mark. Lachmann inferred from this that Mark best preserved a relatively fixed order of episodes in Jesus's ministry.\n\nIn 1838, two theologians, Christian Gottlob Wilke and Christian Hermann Weisse, independently extended Lachmann's reasoning to conclude that Mark not only best represented Matthew and Luke's source but also that Mark was Matthew and Luke's source. Their ideas were not immediately accepted, but Heinrich Julius Holtzmann's endorsement in 1863 of a qualified form of Marcan priority won general favor.\n\nThere was much debate at the time over whether Matthew and Luke used Mark itself or some Proto-Mark (Ur-Mark). In 1899 J. C. Hawkins took up the question with a careful statistical analysis and argued for Marcan priority without Proto-Mark, and other British scholars soon followed to strengthen the argument, which then received wide acceptance.\n\nMany scholars in the twentieth century regarded Marcan priority as no longer just a hypothesis, but an established fact. Still, fresh challenges from B. C. Butler and proved influential in reviving the rival hypothesis of Matthaean priority, and recent decades have seen scholars less certain about Marcan priority and more eager to explore all the alternatives.\n\nIf Marcan priority is accepted, the next logical question is how to explain the extensive material, some two hundred verses, shared between Matthew and Luke but not found at all in Mark—the \"double tradition\". Furthermore, there are hundreds of instances where Matthew and Luke parallel Mark's account but agree against Mark in minor differences—the \"minor agreements\". Different answers to this question give rise to different synoptic theories.\n\n\nThe most prominent challenger to Marcan priority is Marcan posteriority, which holds that Mark used both Matthew and Luke as a source. This hypothesis is most associated with the Two-Gospel (Griesbach) theory, which further posits Matthaean priority (thus, in order, Matthew—Luke—Mark). This view envisions a Mark who mostly collected the common material shared between Matthew and Luke.\n\nMatthaean priority is also a feature of the Augustinian theory, which differs by placing Mark in the middle (thus, the order Matthew—Mark—Luke).\n\nLucan priority has been revived in recent decades in the complex form of the Jerusalem school theory, which also places Mark in the middle. Here, Mark uses Luke, then Matthew uses Mark but not Luke, while all three Synoptics draw from a hypothetical Greek translation of an earlier Hebrew work.\n\nSome theories deny literary priority to any one of the Synoptic Gospels, asserting that, whatever their chronological order of composition, none of them draws from any of the others. The multi-source theory has each synoptic gospel combining a distinct mix of earlier documents, while the independence theory denies any documentary relationship and regards each gospel as an original composition utilizing oral sources only.\n\nSome variations on Marcan priority propose an additional revision of Mark—a \"Proto-Mark\" (\"Ur-Mark\") if earlier than the canonical Gospel, or a \"Deutero-Mark\" if later—serving as a source for Matthew and/or Luke.\n\nArguments for Marcan priority are usually made in contrast to its main rival, Matthaean priority, bringing into focus the question of whether Matthew was a source for Mark or vice versa. The evidence supporting Marcan priority is entirely internal.\n\nMany lines of evidence point to Mark having some sort of special place in the relationship among the Synoptics, as the \"middle term\" between Matthew and Luke. But this could mean that Mark is the common source of the other two (\"priority\"), or that it derives from both (\"posteriority\"), or even that it is an intermediary in transmission from one to the other—in other words, many such arguments can support both Marcan priority and its rivals. Famously, the so-called \"Lachmann fallacy\", concerning the order of pericopae in Mark, was once used to argue for Marcan priority but is now seen as a largely neutral observation.\n\nModern arguments for or against Marcan priority tend to center on redactional plausibility, asking, for example, whether it is more reasonable that Matthew and Luke could have written as they did with Mark in hand, or that Mark could have written as he did with Matthew and Luke in hand, and whether any coherent rationale can be discerned underlying the redactional activity of the later evangelists.\n\nIt should also be remembered, where matters of detailed wording are concerned, that there is some uncertainty in the Gospel texts themselves, as textual criticism of the gospels is still an active field, which cannot even decide, for example, on Mark's original ending. Such issues often intersect with the synoptic problem; for example, Streeter famously dismissed many of the \"minor agreements\" so troublesome for the two-source theory by appealing to textual corruption driven typically by harmonization.\n\nMark's style of Greek is unique among the Gospels. Some scholars have argued that Mark's style is unsophisticated and unrefined or awkward. But others find Mark's Greek very dense and detailed. Mark is full of Latinisms, in idioms and vocabulary. Mark tends to conjoin verbs and sentences with ' (\"and\"); in fact, more than half the verses in Mark begin with '. Mark is notably fond of ' (\"immediately\") and ' (\"again\"), frequently uses dual expressions, and often prefers the historical present. In essence, then, Mark's style is not so much literary as thoroughly colloquial.\n\nThe parallel passages in Matthew and especially in Luke tend to be in a more polished and eloquent style of literary Greek. Where Mark uses an unusual word or expression, Matthew and Luke often substitute something more natural. Though they often add material of substance, they tend to trim down Mark's redundancies and verbosity and express his meaning more concisely.\n\nSupporters of Marcan priority see this as Matthew and Luke improving the style of the material they incorporate from Mark. Supporters of Marcan posteriority, however, see Mark as recasting material from Matthew and Luke in his own peculiar style, less like lofty literature and more in a vivid, fast-moving style befitting oral preaching.\n\nMark's gospel is by far the shortest, just over half the length of Luke, and omits much found in Matthew and Luke. In fact, while the majority of Mark is included in the other two Synoptics, the additional material shared between Matthew and Luke only is quite extensive.\n\nWhile Marcan priority easily sees Matthew and Luke building upon Mark by adding new material, Marcan posteriority must explain some surprising omissions. Mark has no infancy narrative nor any version of the Lord's Prayer, for example.\n\nNor does Mark have more than a handful of unique pericopes. This is expected under Marcan priority, where Matthew has reused nearly everything he found in Mark, but if Mark wrote last, it is harder to explain why he adds so little new material.\n\nBut Mark's selection of material must be explained in either case, unless we are to believe that Mark knew nothing more about Jesus than what he wrote. Bauckham argues that Mark's content is limited to what Peter himself had witnessed, or at least learned from trusted associates. Powers argues that Mark's purpose is fundamentally kerygmatic, needing to hold the attention of outsiders hearing the Gospel preached for the first time, so he focused on who Jesus was and what he did, eschewing the sort of lengthy teachings that dominate the double tradition and most of Special Matthew. So, with Mark's selection process better understood, his omissions per se are no longer viewed as such compelling evidence for Marcan priority.\n\nThere are very few passages in Mark with no parallel in either Matthew or Luke, which makes them all the more significant:\n\nIf Mark is drawn from Matthew and Luke, it is hard to see why he would add so little material, if he were going to add anything at all, and the choice of additions is also rather strange. On the other hand, if Mark wrote first, it is easier to see why Matthew and Luke would omit these passages. These two healings are the only ones in the Synoptics involving the use of saliva (but cf. the healing of the man born blind in ), and the naked runaway is an obscure incident with no obvious meaning or purpose.\n\nBut this does not tell the whole story, for altogether Mark has (depending on the method of counting) about 155 verses included in neither Matthew nor Luke—nearly a quarter of his entire Gospel. Most of these are details omitted in the parallel passages, rather than distinct pericopes. In fact, apart from sayings material, nearly every pericope in Mark is longer than its parallels in Matthew and Luke. An illustrative example is the calming of the storm:\n\nMark's unique details tend to be, by necessity, non-essential ones. Marcan priority sees Matthew and Luke trimming away trivial narrative details in favor of the extensive material they wished to add elsewhere. But under Marcan posteriority, Mark must have added these many details to make his stories more vivid and clear. In either case, Mark must have had an independent source (traditionally, Peter) spanning nearly his entire Gospel; but if so, Marcan posteriority requires a complex and skillful weaving together of this source with both Matthew and Luke, even within individual sentences, which would have been a challenging task.\n\nOften the differences in Mark from the parallels in Matthew and Luke are \"hard readings\", which seem to portray Jesus or the apostles in a negative light or in ways that a later redactor would likely find uncongenial. Marcan priority argues that these hard readings were more likely original to Mark and then smoothed out or omitted when Matthew and Luke encountered them, rather than added by Mark to accounts lacking them.\n\nNotable hard readings unique to Mark include:\n\nMarcan posteriority faces the harder task of accounting for these as Marcan changes, but does so by appealing to Mark's fondness for vivid detail and for starkly contrasting Jesus' teachings with the attitudes of those around him.\n\nComparing the sequential order of parallel pericopes among the three Synoptics, the arrangement often varies, but some general patterns emerge. Mark nearly always follows Matthew and Luke where they agree in order and one or the other when they disagree. On the other hand, the double tradition pericopae shared between Matthew and Luke show little agreement in order.\n\nSuch observations have been studied in detail for centuries, but the difficulty has been in how to interpret them. Marcan priority views this order as support for Matthew and Luke each building upon Mark; Marcan posteriority, however, sees this order as proof that Mark drew alternately from Matthew and Luke. Even the Augustinian hypothesis can see Mark adapting Matthew's order, then Luke adapting Mark's order.\n\nMark displays a special fondness for \"dualisms\" of various kinds, one of which is repeating essentially the same thing in two adjacent phrases. In a majority of cases, the parallel passages in Matthew and Luke, if any, echo only one of the two, and it often happens that Matthew chooses one and Luke chooses the other. Some prominent examples:\n\n\nSupporters of Marcan posteriority advance these as clear cases of Mark conflating the parallel accounts from Matthew and Luke. Supporters of Marcan priority, on the other hand, point to a larger number of instances where both Matthew and Luke have chosen the same half of a Marcan dualism and argue that, when each gospel trimmed down these redundant expressions, sometimes by chance Matthew and Luke made opposite choices. It is hard to judge, though, as the choice can seldom be seen as an arbitrary one.\n\nRiley observes when Matthew has one or both halves of a Marcan dualism, it usually occurs where Matthew and Mark are following the same sequence; when Luke has one or both halves of a Marcan dualism, it \"always\" occurs where Luke and Mark are following the same sequence. This is expected under Marcan posteriority, assuming the Marcan account can more easily refer to Matthew from memory, but more difficult to explain under Marcan priority.\n\nGoodacre lists a number of occasions where it appears that Matthew or Luke begin by altering Mark, but become fatigued and lapse into copying Mark directly, even when doing so is inconsistent with the changes they have already made.\n\nFor example, Matthew is more precise than Mark in the titles he gives to rulers, and initially gives Herod Antipas the correct title of \"tetrarch\", yet he lapses into calling him \"king\" at a later verse, apparently because he was copying Mark at that point.\n\nAnother example is Luke's version of the Parable of the Sower, regarding the seed sown on rocky ground, where Luke omits several elements of the parable, but then follows Mark in the parable's interpretation. Luke says merely that the seed withered for lack of moisture and does not mention the seed springing up quickly, nor the lack of roots, nor being scorched by the sun; yet these omissions remain in the interpretation as, respectively, receiving the word with joy, having no firm root, and the time of temptation.\n\nThis phenomenon, along with the lack of counterexamples of fatigue occurring in the opposite direction, supports Marcan priority.\n\nWhere Mark mentions someone by name, someone not well-known originally who could have been left anonymous, Bauckham argues that it is because his audience at the time could refer to them as living eyewitnesses. Several persons are named only in Mark:\n\n\nThe reverse situation of Matthew or Luke naming those unnamed in Mark never occurs. If, as Bauckham reasons, the reason for the omission of these names in Matthew and Luke is that these persons have since died, this phenomenon lends support to Mark being composed earliest.\n\nThe early patristic evidence records a few traditions on the origins of the Synoptic Gospels. It never indicates that one gospel used another as a source and shows little concern even for their chronological order; the focus was rather on who composed them and on their apostolic authority. What evidence there is as to the order of composition or publication is seen as virtually unanimous agreement on placing Matthew first.\n\nThe earliest relevant source is Papias (c. 105), whose surviving fragments report two notable facts, echoed by most later sources. The evangelist Mark, he says, was Peter's interpreter and compiled his Gospel from the preaching of Peter in Rome, which Peter then sanctioned for use in the churches. Matthew the Apostle, on the other hand, wrote his account himself in the \"Hebrew dialect\".\n\nThis account of the origin of Mark is seen as likely genuine by many scholars, though hardly all. If so, Mark's source is not the other two Synoptics but Peter—unless Peter himself drew from them, as some propose.\n\nThe curious statement that Matthew's \"logia\" (as Papias calls it) was written in the \"Hebrew dialect\"—the ordinary way of referring to either the Hebrew or the Aramaic language—has been much discussed. The difficulty is that canonical Matthew is in Greek and does not appear to be a translation, nor is any such original Hebrew version known. Some scholars have argued that Papias simply meant \"a Semitic style\" in Greek. Other synoptic theorists have speculated on some role of this \"logia\" as a source for the canonical Gospels; the hypothesis, for example, that canonical Matthew was a recension of the \"logia\" making use also of Mark's Gospel was the original foundation for the two-source theory.\n\nEphrem (c. 350) is more explicit about the Gospels' languages: \"Matthew the Hebrew wrote this, and behold it was turned into Greek…. Matthew wrote the Gospel in Hebrew, Mark in Latin from Simon in the city of Rome, Luke in Greek,\" and this is echoed in many later sources. Mark writing in Latin may have arisen merely by inference, but it is true that canonical Mark exhibits numerous Latinisms, and some have argued that indeed canonical Mark was translated from a Latin original. Most scholars, however, reject this view and consider the Greek original.\n\nIrenaeus (c. 185), who knew the work of Papias, gives the first extant account of the origins of Luke (to which later sources add little) and of all four Gospels together: \n\nIt is doubtful whether Irenaeus intends a chronological order in this passage; \"while\" need not be understood temporally, and \"after their departure\" need not indicate the time of composition, but simply that the apostles' testimony survived in writing even after they themselves were gone. Elsewhere Irenaeus often prefers the order Matthew—Luke—Mark—John when addressing the Gospels together, and this order thereafter recurs commonly in a wide variety of ancient sources. In fact, early Bibles and canons arranged the four Gospels in many different sequences, though most placed Matthew first among the Synoptics.\n\nFrom Clement (c. 195), who probably also knew the work of Papias, comes a unique and much-discussed statement that the gospels with genealogies (i.e., Matthew and Luke) were \"written before\" (\"progegraphthai\"), in contrast to Mark. Farmer touted this as support for Marcan posteriority, but Carlson argued that the word was better interpreted as \"openly published\", in contrast to Mark's initially private circulation.\n\nOrigen (c. 250), a pupil of Clement who also knew the work of Irenaeus well, enumerates the Gospels as follows: \"As learned by tradition… the first written was Matthew… the second, Mark… the third, Luke… after all of them, John.\" Most readers then and now have seen this as a clear statement of chronology, though some have doubted that was Origen's intent. In any case, this canonical order was increasingly well established by this time, and subsequent sources accepted this temporal sequence.\n\nAugustine (c. 400) recites this traditional chronological order and adds his own influential inferences. Denying that each evangelist wrote in ignorance of his predecessors, he describes Mark as \"seemingly an attendant and epitomizer\" of Matthew. Later in the same work, Augustine revises his opinion and sees Mark as following not only Matthew but also Luke; Mark \"walks with both\". This is sometimes seen as the first suggestion that one Gospel used another as a source, but it is not at all clear whether Augustine had literary dependence in mind.\n\nIn summary, the external evidence stands against Matthew using Mark, inasmuch as Matthew was written first, and against Mark directly using Matthew, unless perhaps either of these canonical Gospels is a translation into Greek influenced by the other. The patristic consensus, rather, was literary independence. But the value of this external evidence is uncertain; most synoptic scholars regard it as being of little help and focus almost entirely on the internal evidence instead.\n"}

He is considered one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 20th century.\n\nAs leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, he took an insular Hasidic group that almost came to an end with the Holocaust and transformed it into one of the most influential movements in religious world Jewry, with an international network of over 3,000 educational and social centers. The institutions he established include kindergartens, schools, drug-rehabilitation centers, care-homes for the disabled and synagogues.\n\nSchneerson's published teachings fill more than 300 volumes, and he is noted for his contributions to Jewish continuity and religious thought, as well as his wide-ranging contributions to traditional Torah scholarship. He is recognized as the pioneer of Jewish outreach. Many of his adherents refused to believe that he died on June 12, 1994, believing instead that he did not really die but will reveal himself to be the messiah.\n\nIn 1978, the U.S. Congress asked President Jimmy Carter to designate Schneerson's birthday as the national Education Day U.S.A. It has been since commemorated as Education and Sharing Day. In 1994, he was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his \"outstanding and lasting contributions toward improvements in world education, morality, and acts of charity.\" Schneerson's resting place attracts Jews and non-Jews for prayer.\n\nMenachem Mendel Schneerson was born on April 18, 1902 (OS) (11 Nissan, 5662) in the Black Sea port of Nikolaev in the Russian Empire (now Mykolaiv in Ukraine). His father was rabbi Levi Yitzchak Schneerson, a renowned Talmudic scholar and authority on Kabbalah and Jewish law. His mother was Rebbetzin Chana Schneerson (\"nee\" Yanovski). He was named after the third Chabad rebbe, the Tzemach Tzedek, from whom he was a direct patrilineal descendent.\n\nIn 1907, when Schneerson was six years old, the family moved to Yekatrinislav (today, Dnipro), where Levi Yitzchak was appointed Chief Rabbi of the city. He served until 1939, when he was exiled by the Soviets to Kazakhstan. Schneerson had two younger brothers: Dov Ber, who was murdered in 1944 by Nazi collaborators, and Yisrael Aryeh Leib, who died in 1952 while completing doctoral studies at Liverpool University.\n\nDuring his youth, he received a private education and was tutored by Zalman Vilenkin from 1909 through 1913. When Schneerson was eleven years old, Vilenkin informed his father that he had nothing more to teach his son. At that point, Levi Yitzchak began teaching his son Talmud and rabbinic literature, as well as Kabbalah. Schneerson proved gifted in both Talmudic and Kabalistic study and also took exams as an external student of the local Soviet school. He was considered an \"Illui\" and genius, and by the time he was seventeen, he had mastered the entire Talmud, some 5,894 pages, as well as all its early commentaries.\n\nThroughout his childhood Schneerson was involved in the affairs of his father's office. He was also said to have acted as an interpreter between the Jewish community and the Russian authorities on a number of occasions. Levi Yitzchak's courage and principles were a guide to his son for the rest of his life. Many years later, when he once reminisced about his youth, Schneerson said \"I have the education of the first-born son of the rabbi of Yekatrinoselav. When it comes to saving lives, I speak up whatever others may say.\"\n\nSchneerson went on to receive separate rabbinical ordinations from the Rogatchover Gaon, Yosef Rosen, and Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg, author of \"Sridei Aish\".\n\nIn 1923, Schneerson for the first time visited the sixth Chabad-Lubavitch Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, where he met the rabbi's middle daughter Chaya Mushka (Mousia). Sometime later they became engaged, but were not married until 1928 in Warsaw, Poland. Taking great pride in his son-in-law's outstanding knowledge, Yosef Yitzchak asked him to engage in learned conversation with the great Torah scholars that were present at the wedding, such as Meir Shapiro and Menachem Ziemba. Menachem Mendel and Chaya Mushka were married for 60 years, but were childless.\n\nMenachem Mendel Schneerson and Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn were both descendants of Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, known as the Tzemach Tzedek, the third Rebbe of Chabad Lubavitch. Schneerson later commented that the day of his marriage bound the community to him and him to the community.\n\nIn 1947 Schneerson traveled to Paris, to take his mother, Chana Schneerson, back to New York with him. Schneerson would visit her every day and twice each Friday and prepare her a tea. In 1964, Chana Schneerson died.\n\nOn February 10, 1988, Schneerson's wife, Chaya Mushka Schneerson died. A year after the death of his wife, when the traditional year of Jewish mourning had passed, Schneerson moved into his study above the central Lubavitch synagogue on Eastern Parkway.\n\nAfter his wedding to Chaya Mushka in 1928, Schneerson and his wife moved to Berlin, where he was assigned specific communal tasks by his father-in-law Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, who also requested that he write scholarly annotations to the responsa and various hasidic discourses of the earlier Rebbes of Chabad-Lubavitch. Schneerson studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Berlin. He would later recall that he enjoyed Erwin Schrödinger's lectures. His father-in-law took great pride in his erudite son-in-law's scholarly attainments and paid for all the tuition expenses and helped facilitate his studies throughout.\n\nDuring his stay in Berlin, his father-in-law encouraged him to become more of a public figure, yet Schneerson described himself as an introvert, and was known to plead with acquaintances not to make a fuss over the fact that he was the son-in-law of Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn.\n\nWhile in Berlin, Schneerson met Joseph B. Soloveitchik and the two formed a friendship that remained between them years later when they both emigrated to America.\nHe wrote hundreds of pages of his own original Torah discourses, and conducted a serious interchange of halachic correspondence with many of Eastern Europe's leading rabbinic figures, including the talmudic genius known as the Rogachover Gaon. In 1933 he also met with Chaim Elazar Shapiro, as well as with talmudist Shimon Shkop. During this time he would keep a diary in which he would carefully document his private conversations with his father-in-law, as well as his kabbalistic correspondence with his father, Levi Yitzchak Schneerson.\n\nIn 1933, after the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, Schneerson left Berlin and moved to Paris, France where he continued his religious and communal activities on behalf of his father-in-law, Yosef Yitzchak. He continued studying mechanics and electrical engineering at the ESTP, a Grande école in the Montparnasse district and graduated in July 1937 with a degree. In November 1937, he enrolled at the Sorbonne, where he studied mathematics until World War II broke out in 1939.\n\nDuring that time, Yosef Yitzchak recommended that Professor Alexander Vasilyevitch Barchenko consult with Schneerson regarding various religious and mystical matters, and prominent rabbis, such as Yerachmiel Binyaminson and Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler turned to Schneerson with their rabbinic and kabbalistic queries.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, three days before Paris fell to the Nazis, the Schneersons fled to Vichy, and later to Nice, where they stayed until their final escape from Europe in 1941.\n\nIn 1941, Schneerson escaped from Europe via Lisbon, Portugal. On the eve of his departure, Schneerson penned a treatise where he revealed his vision for the future of world Jewry and humanity. He and his wife Chaya Mushka arrived in New York on June 23, 1941.\n\nShortly after his arrival, his father-in-law appointed him director and chairman of the three Chabad central organizations, Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, Machneh Israel and Kehot Publication Society, placing him at the helm of the movement's Jewish educational, social services, and publishing networks. Over the next decade, Yosef Yitzchak referred many of the scholarly questions that had been inquired of him to Schneerson and he became increasingly known as a personal representative of Yosef Yitzchak.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Schneerson became a naturalized US citizen and, seeking to contribute to the war effort, he volunteered at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, using his electrical engineering background to draw wiring diagrams for the battleship USS Missouri (BB-63), and other classified military work.\n\nIn 1942 Schneerson launched the Merkos Shlichus program where he would send pairs of yeshiva students to remote locations across the country during their summer vacations to teach Jews in isolated communities about their heritage and offer education to their children.\n\nAs chairman and editor in chief of Kehot, Schneerson published the works of the earlier Rebbes of Chabad. He also published his own works including the Hayom Yom in 1943 and Hagadda in 1946.\n\nOn a visit to Paris in 1947 he established a school for girls and worked with local organisations to assist with housing for refugees and displaced persons.\n\nSchneerson often explained that his goal was to \"make the world a better place,\" and to do what he could to eliminate all suffering. In a letter to Israeli President Yitzchak Ben Tzvi, Schneerson wrote that when he was a child the vision of the future redemption began to take form in his imagination \"a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees and annihilation of exile will be understood...\"\n\nIn 1991, a car accompanying Schneerson's motorcade accidentally struck two Guyanese-American children while attempting to catch up to Schneerson's vehicle. One of the children was killed, and the incident triggered the Crown Heights riot. \n\nAfter the death of Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn in 1950, Chabad followers began persuading Schneerson to succeed his father-in-law as Rebbe on the basis of his scholarship, piety, and dynasty. Schneerson was reluctant, and actively refused to accept leadership of the movement. He continued, however, all the communal activities he had previously headed. It would take a full year until he was persuaded by the elders of the movement to accept the post.\n\nOn the first anniversary of his father-in-law's passing, 10 Shevat 1951, in a ceremony attended by several hundred rabbis and Jewish leaders from all parts of the United States and Canada, Schneerson delivered a Hasidic discourse, \"(Ma'amar)\", the equivalent to a President-elect taking the oath of office, and formally became the Rebbe. On the night of his acceptance, members of the Israeli Cabinet and Israel's Chief Yitzhak Herzog sent him congratulatory messages.\n\nReiterating a longstanding core Chabad principle at his inaugural talk, he demanded that each individual exert themselves in advancing spiritually, and \"not\" rely on the Rebbe to do it for them, saying:\n\"Now listen, Jews. Generally, in Chabad it has been demanded that each individual work on themselves, and not rely on the Rebbes. One must, \"on their own\", transform the folly of materialism and the passion of the 'animal soul' to holiness. I do not, God Forbid, recuse myself from assisting as much as possible, however; If one does not work on \"themselves\", what good will submitting notes, singing songs, and saying lechayim do?\" At the same talk, Schneerson said \"one must go to a place where nothing is known of godliness, nothing is known of Judaism, nothing is even known of the Hebrew alphabet, and while there to put oneself aside and ensure that the other calls out to God.\" When he spoke to Forward journalist Asher Penn that year, he said, \"we must stop insisting that Judaism is in danger, an assertion that does little but place Jewry on the defensive. We need to go on the offensive.\"\n\nAs Rebbe, Schneerson would receive visitors for private meetings, known as \"yechidus\", on Sunday and Thursday evenings. Those meetings would begin at 8pm and often continue until five or six in the morning and were open to everyone. Schneerson, who spoke several languages including English, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, Russian, German and Italian, would converse with people on all issues and offer his advice on both spiritual and mundane matters. Politicians and leaders from across the globe came to meet him, but Schneerson showed no preference to one person over another. His secretary once even declined to admit John F. Kennedy because Schneerson was already meeting 'ordinary' people who had requested appointments months previously. Those meetings were discontinued in 1982 when it became impossible to facilitate the large number of people. Meetings were then held only for those who had a special occasion, such as a bride and groom for their wedding or a boy and his family on the occasion of a bar mitzvah.\n\nDuring his four decades as Rebbe, Schneerson would deliver regular addresses, centered on the weekly Torah portion and on various tractates of the Talmud. These talks, delivered without text or notes, would last for several hours, and sometimes went for eight or nine hours straight. During the talks, Schneerson demonstrated a unique approach in explaining seemingly different concepts by analysis of the fundamental principle common to the entire tractate, and referenced both classic and esoteric sources from all periods, citing entire sections by heart.\n\nIn 1951 Schneerson established a Chabad women's and girl's organization and a youth organisation in Israel. Their mission was to engage in outreach directed to women and teens respectively. In 1953 he opened branches in New York, London and Toronto. In a marked departure from an entrenched tendency to limit high-level Torah education to men and boys, Schneerson addressed his teachings equally to both genders. He addressed meetings of the organisations, and led gatherings exclusively for women. Schneerson would describe the increase in Torah study by women as one of the \"positive innovations of the later generations.\"\n\nThat same year Schneerson sent his first emissary to Morocco, and established schools and a synagogue for the Moroccan Jewish community. In 1958 Schneerson established Schools and synagogues in Detroit, Michigan, in Milan, Italy and in London, England. Beginning in the 1960s, Schneerson instituted a system of \"mitzvah campaigns\" to encourage the observance of ten basic Jewish practices, such as Tefillin for men, Shabbat candles for women and loving your fellow for all people. Schneersohn's campaign brought the concept of tefillin to Jewish men everywhere, and he has been referred to as \"the great modern popularizer of tefillin.\" Until his campaign, tefillin was largely the domain of the meticulously observant.\n\nFollowing the death of his mother in 1964, Chana Schneerson, Schneerson began to offer an additional weekly sermon in her memory. These sermons, consisted of original insights and unprecedented analysis of Rashi's Torah commentary, which were delivered at the regular public gatherings. Schneerson gave these sermons each week until 1992.\n\nIn 1973, Schneerson started a Chanukah campaign to encourage all Jews worldwide to light their own menorah. After all tin menorahs were given out that year, a military manufacturer was commissioned to make tens of thousands of additional menorahs for distribution. In 1974, a public lighting of a Chanukah menorah was held by the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in years following menorah lightings on public grounds were conducted in cities worldwide. Legal challenges to the lightings on public grounds reached the Supreme Court and it was ruled that public lightings did not violate the Constitution. Public lightings continue in thousands of cities today.\n\nIn 1979, during the Islamic Revolution and Iranian hostage crisis, Schneerson directed arrangements to rescue Jewish youth and teenagers from Iran and bring them to safety in the United States. The militant Islamist hostilities towards the United States were seen by Schneerson as behavior that could threaten the country's status as an \"untouchable\" superpower, and that would cause it to try to appease Arab countries, thus \"endanger[ing] the security of Israel.\" As a result of Schneerson's efforts, several thousand Iranian children were flown from Iran to the safety of New York.\n\nIn 1983 Schneerson launched a global campaign to promote awareness of the Supreme Being and observance of the Noahide Laws among all people, arguing that this was the basis for human rights for all civilization. Several times each year his addresses were broadcast on national television. On these occasions Schneerson would address the public on general communal affairs and issues relating to world peace such as a moment of silence in U.S. public schools, increased government funding for solar energy research, U.S. foreign aid to developing countries and nuclear disarmament.\n\nIn 1984, Schneerson initiated a campaign for the daily study of Maimonides's Mishneh Torah. Each year at the completion of the learning cycle there is Siyum celebration marking the end of the cycle and beginning of the new one. These events have been attended by many Jewish leaders. Today, many thousands follow the daily study cycle.\n\nIn 1986, Schneerson began a custom where each Sunday he would stand outside his office, greet people briefly, give them a dollar bill and encourage them to donate to the charity of their choice. Explaining his reason for encouraging charitable giving among all people, Schneerson quoted his father-in-law who said that \"when two people meet, it should bring benefit to a third.\" People on line would often take this opportunity to ask Schneerson for advice or request a blessing. Thousands of people attended this event each week, which lasted up to six hours, and is often referred to as \"Sunday Dollars.\"\n\nSchneerson's wife, Chaya Mushka Schneerson died in 1988. During the week of shiva Schneerson wrote a will in which he bequeathed his entire estate to Agudas Chasidei Chabad, the Chabad umbrella organisation.\n\nDuring a talk in 1991, Schneerson spoke passionately about Moshiach (the Messiah) and told his followers that he had done all that he could to bring world peace and redemption, but that it was now up to them to continue this task: \"I have done my part, from now on you do all that you can.\" A few months later, when a reporter from CNN came to meet him at dollars, he said, \"Moshiach is ready to come now, it is only on our part to do something additional in the realm of goodness and kindness.\"\n\nOn Sunday, March 1, 1992, Gabriel Erem, the editor of \"Lifestyles Magazine\" told Schneerson that on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday they would be publishing a special issue and wanted to know what his message to the world was. Schneerson replied that \"'Ninety', in Hebrew, is 'tzaddik'; which means 'righteous.' And that is a direct indication for every person to become a real tzaddik - a righteous person, and to do so for many years, until 120. This message\", Schneerson added, \"applies equally to Jews and non-Jews\".\n\nDuring his decades of leadership, Schneerson worked over 18 hours a day and never took a day of vacation. He rarely left Brooklyn except for visits to his father-in-law's gravesite in Queens, New York. Schneerson was opposed to retirement, seeing it as a waste of precious years. In 1972, on the occasion of his 70th birthday, instead of announcing a retirement plan, Schneerson proposed the establishment of 71 new institutions to mark the beginning of the 71st year of his life.\n\nIn 1977, during the \"hakafot\" ceremony on Shemini Atzeret, Schneerson suffered a heart attack. At his request, rather than transporting him to a hospital, the doctors set up a mini-hospital at his office where he was treated for the next four weeks by Dr. Bernard Lown, Dr. Ira Weiss and Dr. Larry Resnick.\nFifteen years later Schneerson suffered a serious stroke while praying at the grave of his father-in-law. The stroke left him unable to speak and paralyzed on the right side of his body. During this time, the hope that Schneerson could be revealed as the Messiah (Moshiach) became more widespread.\nOn the morning of June 12, 1994 (3 Tammuz 5754), Schneerson died at the Beth Israel Medical Center and was buried at the Ohel next to his father-in-law, Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, at Montefiore Cemetery in Queens, New York. Shortly after Schneerson's death, the executors of his will discovered several notebooks in a drawer in his office, in which Schneerson had written his scholarly thoughts and religious musings from his earliest years. The majority of entries in these journals date between the years 1928 and 1950 and were subsequently published.\n\nFollowing age-old Jewish tradition that the resting place of a tzadik is holy, Schneerson's gravesite is viewed by many as a holy site and has been described by the Yedioth Ahronoth as \"the American Western Wall\", where thousands of people, Jews and non-Jews, go to pray each week. Many more send faxes and e-mails with requests for prayers to be read at the gravesite.\n\nSchneerson spoke of the position of the United States as a world superpower, and would praise its foundational values of '\"E pluribus unum'—from many one\", and \"In God we trust\". He called on the government to develop independent energy, and not need to rely on totalitarian regimes whose countries national interests greatly differed from the U.S. Schneerson also called for the U.S. Government to use its influence on countries who were receiving its foreign aid to do more for the educational and cultural needs of their deprived citizens.\n\nSchneerson placed a strong emphasis on education and often spoke of the need of a moral educational system for all people. He was an advocate of a Department of Education as a separate cabinet position from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Schneerson proclaimed 1977 as a \"Year of Education\" and urged Congress to do the same. He stated that education \"must think in terms of a 'better living' not only for the individual, but also for the society as a whole. The educational system must, therefore, pay more attention to the building of character, with emphasis on moral and ethical values. Education must put greater emphasis on the promotion of fundamental human rights and obligations of justice and morality, which are the basis of any human society\".\n\nThe Ninety-Fifth Congress of the United States issued a Joint Resolution proclaiming 1978 as a Year of Education and designating April 18, 1978, as \"Education Day, U.S.A.\". Each year since, the President of the United States has proclaimed Schneerson's birthday as \"Education Day, U.S.A.\" in his honor.\n\nDuring his life, Schneerson had great influence on numerous political leaders from across the aisle, many of whom would seek his advice. He was visited by Presidents, Prime Ministers, Governors, Senators, Congressmen and Mayors. Notable among them are John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Jacob Javits, Ed Koch, Rudy Giuliani, David Dinkins and Joe Lieberman.\n\nSchneerson took great interest in the affairs of the state of Israel, and did whatever was in his power to support the infrastructure of the state and advance its success. He was concerned with the agricultural, industrial and overall economic welfare of Israel, and sought to promote its scientific achievements, and enhance Israel's standing in the international community. Schneerson consistently expressed enormous recognition of the role of the Israel Defense Forces and stated that those who serve in the Israeli army perform a great Mitzva.\n\nIn 1950 Schneerson encouraged the establishment of Israel's first automobile company. By 1956, the company was responsible for 28% of Israel's exports. Schneerson established a network of trade schools in Israel to provide Israeli youth, new immigrants and Holocaust survivors with vocational training and livelihood. In 1954 Schneerson established a school for carpentry and woodwork. In 1955 he established a school for agriculture. In 1956 he established a school for printing and publishing and in 1957 a school for textiles.\n\nAlthough he never visited Israel, many of Israel's top leadership made it a point to visit him. Israeli President Zalman Shazar would visit Schneerson and corresponded extensively with him as would Prime Minister Menachem Begin who came to visit him before going to Washington to meet President Carter. Ariel Sharon who had a close relationship with Schneerson, often quoted his views on military matters and sought his advice when he considered retiring from the military. Schneerson advised the general to remain at his post. Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu also visited and sought Schneerson's advice. Israeli politicians and military experts who came to consult with him were surprised by his detailed knowledge of their country's local affairs and international situation on strategic and diplomatic fronts. Despite his advisory meetings with American and Israeli political notables, Schneerson stated his nonpartisan policy many times, warning of his non-involvement in politics.\n\nSchneerson publicly expressed his view that the safety and stability of Israel were in the best interests of the United States, calling Israel the front line against those who want the anti-Western nations to succeed. He was opposed to land for peace, which he called an \"illusion of peace\", saying that it would not save lives, but harm lives. Schneerson stated that this position was not based on nationalistic or other religious reasons, but purely out of concern for human life. Benjamin Netanyahu said that while serving as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in 1984, Schneerson told him: \"you will be serving in a house of darkness, but remember, that even in the darkest place; the light of a single candle can be seen far and wide...\" Netanyahu later retold this episode in a speech at the General Assembly, on Sept 23, 2011.\n\nJust before the outbreak of the Six-Day War, Schneerson called for a global Teffilin campaign, to see that Jews observe the Mitzva of Tefillin as a means of ensuring divine protection against Israel's enemies. Speaking to a crowd of thousands of people on May 28, 1967, only a few days before the outbreak of the war, he assured the world that Israel would be victorious. He said Israel had no need to fear as God was with them, quoting the verse, \"the Guardian of Israel neither sleeps nor slumbers\".\n\nAfter the Operation Entebbe rescue, in a public talk on 16 August 1976, Schneerson applauded the courage and selflessness of the IDF, \"who flew thousands of miles, putting their lives in danger for the sole purpose of possibly saving the lives of tens of Jews\". He said: \"their portion in the Hereafter is guaranteed\". He was later vilified by ultra-haredi rabbis for publicly praising the courage of the IDF and suggesting that God chose them as a medium through which he would send deliverance to the Jewish people. Schneerson protested vehemently against those elements within the ultra-haredi society who sought to undermine the motivations and actions of the soldiers.\n\nHe corresponded with David Ben-Gurion on the issue of Judaism in the State of Israel, asking the Prime Minister to ensure that Israel \"remains Jewish\". He lobbied Israeli politicians to pass legislation in accordance with Jewish law on the question \"Who is a Jew?\" and asked that they add the words \"according to Halakha\" to the declaration so that it state that \"only one who is born of a Jewish mother or converted according to Halakha is Jewish\". This caused a furor in the United States. Some American Jewish philanthropies stopped financially supporting Chabad-Lubavitch since most of their members were connected to Reform and Conservative Judaism. Other controversial issues such as his opposition to territorial com\n\nSchneerson greatly encouraged the Jews who lived in Communist states. He sent many emissaries on covert missions to sustain Judaism under Communist regimes and to provide them with their religious and material needs. Many Jews from behind the iron curtain would correspond with Schneerson, sending their letters to him via secret messenger and addressing Schneerson in code name.\n\nSchneerson, who had an intimate knowledge of the Soviet government and their tactics, opposed demonstrations on behalf of Soviet Jews, stating that he had evidence that they were harming Russia's Jews. Instead he advocated quiet diplomacy, which he said would be more effective. Schneerson did whatever was in his power to push for the release of Jews from the former Soviet Union and established schools, communities and other humanitarian resources to assist with their absorption into Israel. On one known occasion he instructed Senator Chic Hecht to provide President Ronald Reagan with contact information of people who wished to leave so that he could lobby their release.\n\nFollowing the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, Schneerson called for efforts to rescue Ukrainian Jewish children from Chernobyl and founded a special organization for this purpose. The first rescue flight occurred on August 3, 1990, when 196 Jewish children were flown to Israel and brought to a shelter campus. Since then, thousands of children have been rescued and brought to Israel, where they receive housing, education and medical care in a supportive environment.\n\nNatan Sharansky, the Chairman of the Jewish Agency said that Chabad Lubavitch was an essential connector to Soviet Jewry during the Cold War, while Shimon Peres has stated that it's to Schneerson's credit that \"Judaism in the Soviet Union has been preserved\".\n\nSchneerson initiated Jewish outreach in the post-Holocaust era and believed that world Jewry was seeking to learn more about its heritage. He sought to bring Judaism to Jews wherever they were and was the first person in all of history to try reach every Jewish community and every Jew in the world. British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said of Schneerson \"that if the Nazis searched out every Jew in hate, the Rebbe wished to search out every Jew in love\". He oversaw the building of schools, community centers, and youth camps and created a global network of emissaries, known as Shluchim.\n\nToday there are \"shluchim\" in all of the 50 US states, in over 100 countries and 1,000 cities around the world, totaling more than 3,600 institutions including some 300 in Israel. Chabad is very often the only Jewish presence in a given town or city and it has become the face of Jewish Orthodoxy for the Jewish and general world.\n\nSchneerson's model of Jewish outreach has been imitated by all Jewish movements including the Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and Haredi. His published works fill more than 200 volumes and are often used as source text for sermons of both Chabad and non-Chabad rabbis. Beyond the Jewish world, Peggy Noonan has written that moral issues would be better addressed by leaders such as Schneerson than by politicians, and since his death, Schneerson has been referred to as the Rebbe for all people.\n\nSchneerson's contributions to education and the betterment of mankind have been recognized by every president since Richard Nixon. In 1978, Schneerson became the first – and only – rabbi to have a U.S. national day proclaimed in his honor, when the U.S. congress and President Jimmy Carter designated Schneersons birthdate as \"Education Day USA.\" Each year since, the President has called on all Americans to focus on education in honor of Schneerson. In 1982 Ronald Reagan also proclaimed Schneerson's birthday as a \"National Day of Reflection\", and presented the \"National Scroll of Honor\" that was signed by the President, Vice-President and every member of Congress.\n\nNumerous public officials attended Schneerson's funeral, including New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Benjamin Netanyahu and the entire staff of the Israeli consulate in Washington.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton penned a condolence letter \"to the Chabad-Lubavitch community and to world Jewry\" and spoke of Schneerson as \"a monumental man who as much as any other individual, was responsible over the last half a century for advancing the instruction of ethics and morality to our young people.\" Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin, cited Schneerson's great scholarship and contribution to the entire Jewish people and proclaimed \"The Rebbe's loss is a loss for all the Jewish people.\" Foreign Minister Shimon Peres cited words from the prophet Malachi as applying with particular force to Schneerson: \"He brought back many from iniquity. For a priest's lips shall guard knowledge, and teaching should be sought from his mouth. For he is a messenger of the Lord.\"\n\nShortly after his death, Schneerson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, honoring Schneerson for his \"outstanding and enduring contributions toward world education, morality, and acts of charity\". President Bill Clinton spoke these words at the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony:\n\nIn 2009, the National Museum of American Jewish History selected Schneerson as one of eighteen American Jews to be included in their \"Only in America\" Hall of Fame.\n\nSchneerson is recognized for his scholarship and contributions to Talmudic, Halachic, Kabalistic and Chasidic teachings. Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who knew Schneerson from their days in Berlin, and remained in contact once the two men came to America, told his students after visiting Schneerson \"the Rebbe has a 'gewaldiger' (awesome) comprehension of the Torah,\" and \"He is a gaon, he is a great one, he is a leader of Israel.\"\n\nAccording to Mordechai Eliyahu, former chief Rabbi of Israel, his meeting with Schneerson \"covered all sections of the Torah\" Eliyahu said \"The Rebbe jumped effortlessly from one Talmudic tractate to another, and from there to Kabbalah and then to Jewish law... It was as if he had just finished studying these very topics from the holy books. The whole Torah was an open book in front of him\".\n\nSchneerson's teachings have been published in more than two hundred volumes. Schneerson also penned tens of thousands of letters in reply to requests for blessings and advice. These detailed and personal letters offer advice and explanation on a wide variety of subjects, including spiritual matters as well as all aspects of life.\n\n\n\nDuring 1967, shortly before the Six-Day War, Schneerson launched a \"Tefilin campaign\" which encouraged the Jewish commandment (mitzvah) of the donning of Tefilin especially by non-affiliated Jews. Within the Haredi community, criticism of the campaign was voiced at the Agudat Israel convention of 1968. However, following the incident, Yitzchok Hutner, a prominent Orthodox rabbi who had corresponded with Schneersohn in the past, wrote to Schneerson privately, distancing himself from the convention. Hutner wrote that he had not been at the convention and asked forgiveness for any pain his earlier letters (discussing halachic issues regarding the tefillin campaign) may have caused.\n\nElazar Shach was the only Lithuanian Haredi rabbi to forcefully attack Menachem Mendel Schneerson and the Chabad movement. During the 1980s, Shach publicly criticized Chabad's Lag Baomer parades. Shach, a vocal critic, compared Schneerson to the 17th-century false messiah Sabbatai Zevi, and labeled Schneerson a \"false messiah\" (\"meshiach sheker\").\n\nThere is considerable controversy within Chabad about Schneerson's will, as he named no successor as leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty. He did however write one legal will, which was signed before witnesses, whereby he transferred stewardship of all the major Chabad institutions as well as all his possessions to Agudas Chassidei Chabad.\n\nAnother will, no executed copies of which are known to be in existence, named three senior Chabad rabbis as directors of Agudas Chassidei Chabad.\n\nSchneerson was criticized for his passion and desire to raise awareness of the coming of the Messiah. Detractors criticized a children's song with the words \"We want \"moshiach\" (the messiah) now / We don't want to wait,\" that Schneerson commended.\n\nDuring his life, his admirers hoped that he would be revealed as the Messiah. Admirers pointed to traditional Jewish theology which teaches that in every generation there is one person who is worthy of being the Messiah, and if God deems the times right, he will be revealed by God as such. Chabad followers also pointed to a tradition that in every generation there is one person who is considered the Messiah of the generation.\n\nSchneerson's supporters have claimed that many Jews felt that if there was indeed a person worthy of such stature, it was Schneerson. Although Schneerson constantly objected to any talk that he could be the Messiah, this notion sparked controversy, particularly among those who were unfamiliar with these traditional teachings.\nSince Schneerson's passing, the Messianic movement has largely shrunk, although many followers still believe him to be the Messiah. The Chabad umbrella organization, Agudas Chasidei Chabad, has condemned Messianic behavior, stating that it defies the express wishes of Schneerson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

From the age of three, he raised at Oppdal in Trøndelag. He earned an M.A. degree in literature and art history at the University of Oslo in 1929. He was an advocate of the use of Nynorsk and served as the chairman of the student Nynorsk association. He was also in the Mot Dag movement.\n\nDalgard worked as a literary critic for the newspapers \"Dagbladet\" and \"Arbeiderbladet\". \nDalgard took over as dramatic advisor and instructor for Det Norske Teateret in 1931 and was attached to the theater for 48 years.\n\nHe studied film in the Soviet Union and in the 1930s produced several films with a socialist message.

Although the writing system does not describe sounds directly, shared phonetic components of the most ancient Chinese characters are believed to link words that were pronounced similarly at that time. The oldest surviving Chinese verse, in the \"Classic of Poetry\" (\"Shijing\"), shows which words rhymed in that period. Scholars have compared these bodies of contemporary evidence with the much later Middle Chinese reading pronunciations listed in the \"Qieyun\" rime dictionary published in 601 AD, though this falls short of a phonemic analysis. Supplementary evidence has been drawn from cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages and in Min Chinese, which split off before the Middle Chinese period, Chinese transcriptions of foreign names, and early borrowings from and by neighbouring languages such as Hmong–Mien, Tai and Tocharian languages.\n\nAlthough many details are disputed, most recent reconstructions agree on the basic structure. It is generally agreed that Old Chinese differed from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless sonorants. Most recent reconstructions also posit consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, developing into tone distinctions in Middle Chinese.\n\nAlthough many details are still disputed, recent formulations are in substantial agreement on the core issues.\nFor example, the Old Chinese initial consonants recognized by Li Fang-Kuei and William Baxter are given below, with Baxter's (mostly tentative) additions given in parentheses:\n\nMost scholars reconstruct clusters of with other consonants, and possibly other clusters as well, but this area remains unsettled.\n\nIn recent reconstructions, such as the widely accepted system of , the rest of the Old Chinese syllable consists of\n\nIn such systems, Old Chinese has no tones; the rising and departing tones of Middle Chinese are treated as reflexes of the Old Chinese post-codas.\n\nThe primary sources of evidence for the reconstruction of the Old Chinese initials are medieval rhyme dictionaries and phonetic clues in the Chinese script.\n\nThe reconstruction of Old Chinese often starts from \"Early Middle Chinese\", the phonological system of the \"Qieyun\", a rhyme dictionary published in 601, with many revisions and expansions over the following centuries.\nAccording to its preface, the \"Qieyun\" did not record a single contemporary dialect, but set out to codify the pronunciations of characters to be used when reading the classics, incorporating distinctions made in different parts of China at the time (a diasystem).\nThese dictionaries indicated pronunciation using the \"fanqie\" method, dividing a syllable into an initial consonant and the rest, called the final.\nRhyme tables from the Song dynasty contain a sophisticated feature analysis of the \"Qieyun\" initials and finals, though not a full phonemic analysis.\nMoreover, they were influenced by the different pronunciations of that later period.\nScholars have attempted to determine the phonetic content of the various distinctions by examining pronunciations in modern varieties and loans in Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese (the Sinoxenic materials), but many details regarding the finals are still disputed.\n\nThe \"Qieyun\" distinguishes the following initials, each traditionally named with an exemplary word and classified according to the rhyme table analysis:\nBy studying sound glosses given by Eastern Han authors, the Qing philologist Qian Daxin discovered that the Middle Chinese dental and retroflex stop series were not distinguished at that time.\nThe resulting inventory of 32 initials (omitting the rare initial ) is still used by some scholars within China, such as He Jiuying.\nEarly in the 20th century, Huang Kan identified 19 Middle Chinese initials that occurred with a wide range of finals, calling them the \"original ancient initials\", from which the other initials were secondary developments:\n\nAlthough the Chinese writing system is not alphabetic, comparison of words whose characters share a phonetic element (a phonetic series) yields much information about pronunciation.\nOften the characters in a phonetic series are still pronounced alike, as in the character (\"zhōng\", 'middle'), which was adapted to write the words \"chōng\" ('pour', ) and \"zhōng\" ('loyal', ).\nIn other cases the words in a phonetic series have very different sounds in any known variety of Chinese, but are assumed to have been similar at the time the characters were chosen.\n\nA key principle, first proposed by the Swedish sinologist Bernhard Karlgren, holds that the initials of words written with the same phonetic component had a common point of articulation in Old Chinese.\nFor example, since Middle Chinese dentals and retroflex stops occur together in phonetic series, they are traced to a single Old Chinese dental series, with the retroflex stops conditioned by an Old Chinese medial .\nThe Middle Chinese dental sibilants and retroflex sibilants also occur interchangeably in phonetic series, and are similarly traced to a single Old Chinese sibilant series, with the retroflex sibilants conditioned by the Old Chinese medial .\n\nHowever, there are several cases where quite different Middle Chinese initials appear together in a phonetic series.\nKarlgren and subsequent workers have proposed either additional Old Chinese consonants or initial consonant clusters in such cases.\nFor example, the Middle Chinese palatal sibilants appear in two distinct kinds of series, with dentals and with velars:\nIt is believed that the palatals arose from dentals and velars followed by an Old Chinese medial , unless the medial was also present.\nWhile all such dentals were palatalized, the conditions for palatalization of velars are only partly understood (see Medials below).\n\nSimilarly, it is proposed that the medial could occur after labials and velars, complementing the instances proposed as sources of Middle Chinese retroflex dentals and sibilants, to account for such connections as:\nThus the Middle Chinese lateral \"l-\" is believed to reflect Old Chinese .\nOld Chinese voiced and voiceless laterals and are proposed to account for a different group of series such as\nThis treatment of the Old Chinese liquids is further supported by Tibeto-Burman cognates and by transcription evidence.\nFor example, the name of the city Alexandria was transcribed in the \"Book of Han\" as ⟨⟩, which is reconstructed as .\nTraces of the earlier liquids are also found in the divergent Waxiang dialect of western Hunan.\n\nVoiceless nasal initials , and are proposed (following Dong Tonghe and Edwin Pulleyblank) in series such as:\n\nClusters and so on are proposed (following Karlgren) for alternations of Middle Chinese nasals and \"s-\" such as\nOther cluster initials, including with stops or stops with , have been suggested but their existence and nature remains an open question.\n\nThe Song dynasty rhyme tables classified \"Qieyun\" syllables as either \"open\" ( \"kāi\") or \"closed\" ( \"hé\"), with the latter believed to indicate a medial \"-w-\" or lip rounding.\nThis medial was unevenly distributed, being distinctive only after velar and laryngeal initials or before \"-ai\", \"-an\" or \"-at\".\nThis is taken (following André-Georges Haudricourt and Sergei Yakhontov) to indicate that Old Chinese had labiovelar and labiolaryngeal initials but no labiovelar medial.\nThe remaining occurrences of Middle Chinese \"-w-\" are believed to result from breaking of a back vowel before these codas (see Vowels below).\n\nAs Middle Chinese \"g-\" occurs only in palatal environments, Li attempted to derive both \"g-\" and \"ɣ-\" from Old Chinese , but had to assume irregular developments in some cases. Li Rong showed that several words with Middle Chinese initial \"ɣ-\" were distinguished in modern Min dialects. For example, 'thick' and 'after' were both \"ɣəu:\" in Middle Chinese, but have velar and zero initials respectively in several Min dialects. Most authors now assume both and , with subsequent lenition of in non-palatal environments. Similarly is assumed as the labialized counterpart of .\n\nPan Wuyun has proposed a revision of the above scheme to account for the fact that Middle Chinese glottal stop and laryngeal fricatives occurred together in phonetic series, unlike dental stops and fricatives, which were usually separated.\nInstead of the glottal stop initial and fricatives and , he proposed uvular stops , and , and similarly labio-uvular stops , and in place of , and .\n\nModern Min dialects, particularly those of northwest Fujian, show reflexes of distinctions not reflected in Middle Chinese.\nFor example, the following dental initials have been identified in reconstructed proto-Min:\n\nOther points of articulation show similar distinctions within stops and nasals.\nProto-Min voicing is inferred from the development of Min tones, but the phonetic values of the initials are otherwise uncertain.\nThe sounds indicated as *\"-t\", *\"-d\", etc. are known as \"softened stops\" due to their reflexes in Jianyang and nearby Min varieties in northwestern Fujian, where they appear as fricatives or approximants (e.g. < \"*-p *-t *-k\" in Jianyang) or are missing entirely, while the non-softened variants appear as stops. Evidence from early loans into Yao languages suggests that the softened stops were prenasalized.\n\nThese distinctions are assumed by most workers to date from the Old Chinese period, but they are not reflected in the widely accepted inventory of Old Chinese initials given above.\nFor example, although Old Chinese is believed to have had both voiced and voiceless nasals, only the voiced ones yield Middle Chinese nasals, corresponding to both sorts of proto-Min nasal.\nThe Old Chinese antecedents of these distinctions are not yet agreed, with researchers proposing a variety of consonant clusters.\n\nThe most contentious aspect of the rhyme tables is their classification of the \"Qieyun\" finals into four divisions ( \"děng\").\nMost scholars believe that finals of divisions I and IV contained back and front vowels respectively.\nDivision II is believed to represent retroflexion, and is traced back to the Old Chinese medial discussed above, while division III is usually taken as indicating a \"-j-\" medial.\nSince Karlgren, many scholars have projected this medial (but not \"-w-\") back onto Old Chinese.\nThe following table shows Baxter's account of the Old Chinese initials and medials leading to the combinations of initial and final types found in Early Middle Chinese.\n\nHere , , , and stand for consonant classes in Old Chinese.\nColumns III-3 and III-4 represent the \"chóngniǔ\" distinction among some syllables with division-III finals, which are placed in rows 3 or 4 of the Song dynasty rhyme tables.\nThe two are generally identical in modern Chinese varieties, but Sinoxenic forms often have a palatal element for III-4 but not III-3.\n\nBaxter's account departs from the earlier reconstruction of Li Fang-Kuei in its treatment of and after labial and guttural initials.\nLi proposed as the source of palatal initials occurring in phonetic series with velars or laryngeals, found no evidence for , and attributed the \"chongniu\" distinction to the vowel.\nFollowing proposals by Pulleyblank, Baxter explains \"chongniu\" using and postulates that plain velars and laryngeals were palatalized when followed by both (but not ) and a front vowel.\nHowever a significant number of palatalizations are not explained by this rule.\n\nA fundamental distinction within Middle Chinese is between syllables with division-III finals and the rest, labelled types B and A respectively by Pulleyblank.\nMost scholars believe that type B syllables were characterized by a palatal medial \"-j-\" in Middle Chinese.\nAlthough many authors have projected this medial back to a medial in Old Chinese, others have suggested that the Middle Chinese medial was a secondary development not present in Old Chinese.\nEvidence includes the use of type B syllables to transcribe foreign words lacking any such medial, the lack of the medial in Tibeto-Burman cognates and modern Min reflexes, and the fact that it is ignored in phonetic series.\nNonetheless, scholars agree that the difference reflects a real phonological distinction of some sort, often described noncommittally as a distinction between type A and B syllables using a variety of notations.\nThe distinction has been variously ascribed to:\n\nA reconstruction of Old Chinese finals must explain the rhyming practice of the \"Shijing\", a collection of songs and poetry from the 10th to 7th centuries BC.\nAgain some of these songs still rhyme in modern varieties of Chinese, but many do not.\nThis was attributed to lax rhyming practice until the late-Ming dynasty scholar Chen Di argued that a former consistency had been obscured by sound change.\nThe systematic study of Old Chinese rhymes began in the 17th century, when Gu Yanwu divided the rhyming words of the \"Shijing\" into ten rhyme groups (\"yùnbù\" ).\nThese groups were subsequently refined by other scholars, culminating in a standard set of 31 in the 1930s.\nOne of these scholars, Duan Yucai, stated the important principle that characters in the same phonetic series would be in the same rhyme group, making it possible to assign almost all words to rhyme groups.\n\nAssuming that rhyming syllables had the same main vowel, Li Fang-Kuei proposed a system of four vowels , , and .\nHe also included three diphthongs , and to account for syllables that were placed in rhyme groups reconstructed with or but were distinguished in Middle Chinese.\nIn the late 1980s, Zhengzhang Shangfang, Sergei Starostin and William Baxter (following Nicholas Bodman) independently argued that these rhyme groups should be split, refining the 31 traditional rhyme groups into more than 50 groups corresponding to a six-vowel system.\nBaxter supported this thesis with a statistical analysis of the rhymes of the \"Shijing\", though there were too few rhymes with codas , and to produce statistically significant results.\n\nThe following table illustrates these analyses, listing the names of the 31 traditional rhyme groups with their Middle Chinese reflexes and their postulated Old Chinese vowels in the systems of Li and Baxter.\nFollowing the traditional analysis, the rhyme groups are organized into three parallel sets, depending on the corresponding type of coda in Middle Chinese.\nFor simplicity, only Middle Chinese finals of divisions I and IV are listed, as the complex vocalism of divisions II and III is believed to reflect the influence of Old Chinese medials and (see previous section).\nThere has been much controversy over the relationship between final consonants and tones, and indeed whether Old Chinese lacked the tones characteristic of later periods, as first suggested by the Ming dynasty scholar Chen Di.\n\nThe four tones of Middle Chinese were first described by Shen Yue around AD 500.\nThey were the \"level\" ( \"píng\"), \"rising\" ( \"shǎng\"), \"departing\" ( \"qù\"), and \"entering\" ( \"rù\") tones, with the last category consisting of the syllables ending in stops (\"-p\", \"-t\" or \"-k\").\nAlthough rhymes in the \"Shijing\" usually respect these tone categories, there are many cases of characters that are now pronounced with different tones rhyming together in the songs, mostly between the departing and entering tones.\nThis led Duan Yucai to suggest that Old Chinese lacked the departing tone.\nWang Niansun (1744 - 1832) and Jiang Yougao (d.1851) decided that the language had the same tones as Middle Chinese, but some words had later shifted between tones, a view that is still widely held among linguists in China.\n\nKarlgren also noted many cases where words in the departing and entering tones shared a phonetic element, e.g.\nHe suggested that the departing tone words in such pairs had ended with a final voiced stop ( or ) in Old Chinese.\nBeing unwilling to split rhyme groups, Dong Tonghe and Li Fang-Kuei extended these final voiced stops to whole rhyme groups.\nThe only exceptions were the and groups (Li's and ), in which the traditional analysis already distinguished the syllables with entering tone contacts.\nThe resulting scarcity of open syllables has been criticized on typological grounds.\nWang Li preferred to reallocate words with connections to the entering tone to the corresponding entering tone group, proposing that the final stop was lost after a long vowel.\n\nAnother perspective is provided by Haudricourt's demonstration that the tones of Vietnamese, which have a very similar structure to those of Middle Chinese, were derived from earlier final consonants.\nThe Vietnamese counterparts of the rising and departing tones derived from a final glottal stop and respectively, the latter developing to a glottal fricative .\nThese glottal post-codas respectively conditioned rising and falling pitch contours, which became distinctive when the post-codas were lost.\nHaudricourt also suggested that the Chinese departing tone was reflected an Old Chinese derivational suffix .\nThe connection with stop finals would then be explained as syllables ending with or , with the stops later disappearing, allowing rhymes with open syllables.\nThe absence of a corresponding labial final could be attributed to early assimilation of to .\nPulleyblank supported the theory with several examples of syllables in the departing tone being used to transcribe foreign words ending in \"-s\" into Chinese.\n\nPulleyblank took Haudricourt's suggestion to its logical conclusion, proposing that the Chinese rising tone had also arisen from a final glottal stop.\nMei Tsu-lin supported this theory with evidence from early transcriptions of Sanskrit words, and pointed out that rising tone words end in a glottal stop in some modern Chinese dialects, e.g. Wenzhounese and some Min dialects.\nIn addition, most of the entering tone words that rhyme with rising tone words in the \"Shijing\" end in \"-k\".\n\nTogether, these hypotheses lead to the following set of Old Chinese syllable codas:\n\nBaxter also speculated on the possibility of a glottal stop occurring after oral stop finals.\nThe evidence is limited, and consists mainly of contacts between rising tone syllables and \"-k\" finals, which could alternatively be explained as phonetic similarity.\n\nTo account for phonetic series and rhymes in which MC \"-j\" alternates with \"-n\", Sergei Starostin proposed that MC \"-n\" in such cases derived from Old Chinese .\nOther scholars have suggested that such contacts are due to dialectal mixture, citing evidence that had disappeared from eastern dialects by the Eastern Han period.\n\n\nWorks cited\n\nTutorials\n\nDatabases of reconstructions\n"}

It is related to the liar paradox as a problem, and it purports to show that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not self-referring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals (i.e. it does not explicitly refer to itself). The paradox can be expressed as follows:\n\nIf the paradox is not clear, consider each part of the above description of the paradox incrementally:\n\nWith these tools, the description of the paradox may now be reconsidered; it can be seen to assert the following:\n\nIn other words, the sentence implies that it is false, which is paradoxical—for if it is false, what it states is in fact true.\n\nThe liar paradox (\"This sentence is false\", or \"The next sentence is true. The previous sentence is false\") demonstrates essential difficulties in assigning a truth value even to simple sentences. Many philosophers, attempting to explain the liar paradox, concluded that the problem was with the use of demonstrative word \"this\" or its replacements. Once we properly analyze this sort of self-reference, according to said philosophers, the paradox no longer arises.\n\nQuine's construction demonstrates that paradox of this kind arises independently of such direct self-reference, for, no lexeme of the sentence refers to the \"sentence,\" though Quine's sentence does contain a lexeme which refers to one of its \"parts\". Namely, \"its\" near the end of the sentence is a possessive pronoun whose antecedent is the very predicate in which it occurs. Thus, although Quine's sentence \"per se\" is not self-referring, it does contain a self-referring predicate.\n\nQuine suggested an unnatural linguistic resolution to such logical antinomies, inspired by Bertrand Russell's Type theory and Tarski's work. His system would attach levels to a line of problematic expressions such as \"falsehood\" and \"denote\". Entire sentences would stand higher in the hierarchy than their parts. The form Clause about falsehood' yields falsehood\" will be grammatically correct, and Denoting phrase' denotes itself\" – wrong.\n\nGeorge Boolos, inspired by his student Michael Ernst, has written that the sentence might be syntactically ambiguous, in using multiple quotation marks whose exact mate marks cannot be determined. He revised traditional quotation into a system where the length of outer pairs of so-called \"q-marks\" of an expression is determined by the q-marks that appear inside the expression. This accounts not only for ordered quotes-within-quotes but also to, say, strings with an odd number of quotation marks.\n\nIn \"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\", author Douglas Hofstadter suggests that the Quine sentence in fact uses an indirect type of self-reference. He then shows that indirect self-reference is crucial in many of the proofs of Gödel's incompleteness theorems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "311214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311214", "title": "Rapport", "text": "Rapport\n\nRapport is a close and harmonious relationship in which the people or groups concerned are “in sync” with each other, understand each other's feelings or ideas, and communicate smoothly.\n\nThe word stems from the old French verb \"rapporter\" which means literally to carry something back; and, in the sense of how people relate to each other means that what one person sends out the other sends back. For example, they may realize that they share similar values, beliefs, knowledge, or behaviors around politics, music or sports. This may also mean that the participants engage in reciprocal behaviors such as posture mirroring or in increased coordination in their verbal and nonverbal interactions.\n\nThere are a number of techniques that are supposed to be beneficial in building rapport such as: matching your body language (i.e., posture, gesture, etc.); indicating attentiveness through maintaining eye contact; and matching breathing rhythm . In conversation, some verbal behaviors associated with increased rapport are the use of positivity (or, positive \"face management\"), sharing personal information of gradually increasing intimacy (or, \"self-disclosure\"), and by referring to shared interests or experiences.\n\nRapport has been shown to have benefits for psychotherapy and medicine, negotiation, and education, among others. In each of these cases, the rapport between members of a dyad (e.g. a teacher and student or doctor and patient) allows the participants to coordinate their actions and establish a mutually beneficial working relationship, or what is often called a “working alliance”.\n\nTo achieve the benefits of interpersonal rapport in domains like education, medicine, or even sales, several methods have been shown to build rapport between people. These methods include coordination, showing your attentiveness to the other, building commonality, and managing the other's self-perception (also called \"face\" management).\n\nCoordination, also called \"mirroring\" means getting into rhythm with another person, or coordinating one's verbal or nonverbal behaviors.\n\nAnother way of building rapport is by each partner indicating their attentiveness to the other. This attentiveness may take the form of nonverbal attentiveness, such as looking at the other person, nodding at appropriate moments, or physical proximity, as seen in work on teachers' \"immediacy\" behaviors in the classroom. This attentiveness might also be demonstrated through reciprocation of nonverbal behaviors like smiling or nodding, similar to the coordination or in the reciprocal sharing of personal details about the other person that signal one's knowledge and attentiveness to their needs.\n\nCommonality is the technique of deliberately finding something in common with a person or a customer in order to build a sense of camaraderie and trust.\nThis is done through references to shared interests, dislikes, and experiences. By sharing personal details or self-disclosing personal preferences or information, interlocutors can build commonality, and thus increase rapport.\n\nAnother way of building rapport is through what is often referred to as \"positive face management\", but may also simply be called positivity. According to some psychologists, we have a need to be seen in a positive light, known as our \"face\". By managing each other's \"face\", boosting it when necessary, or reducing negative impacts to it, we are able to build rapport with others.\n\nThere have been a number of proposed benefits from building interpersonal rapport, which all revolve around smoother interactions, improved collaboration, and improved interpersonal outcomes, though the specifics differ by the domain.\n\nIn the medical domain, doctor-patient rapport is often called the \"Working Alliance\", and is a measure of the collaboration quality between doctor (or therapist) and patient, often used as a predictor of therapy outcomes or patients' prescription adherence.\n\nIn education, teacher-student rapport is predictive of students' participation in the course, their course retention, likelihood to take a course in that domain again, and has sometimes been used to predict course outcomes. Some have argued that teacher-student rapport is an essential element of what makes an effective teacher, or the ability to manage interpersonal relationships and build a positive, pro-social, atmosphere of trust and reduced anxiety. Student-student rapport, on the other hand, while largely out of the teacher's ability to control, is also predictive of reduced anxiety in the course, feelings of a supportive class culture, and improved participation in class discussions.\n\nIn negotiation, rapport is beneficial for reaching mutually beneficial outcomes, as partners are more likely to trust each other and be willing to cooperate and reach a positive outcome. However, others have found that interpersonal rapport in negotiation can lead to unethical behavior, particularly in impasse situations, where the interpersonal rapport may influence the negotiators to behave unethically.\n\nTo better study how rapport can lead to the above benefits, researchers generally adopt one of three main approaches: self-report surveys given to the participants, third-party observations from a naive observer, and some form of automated computational detection, using computer vision and machine learning.\n\nSelf-report surveys typically consist of a set of questions given at the end of the interaction, asking the participants to reflect on their relationship with another person and rate various aspects of that relationship, typically on a Likert scale. Though this is the most common approach, it suffers from unreliability of self-report data, such as the issue of separating participants' reflection on a single interaction with their relationship with the other person more broadly.\n\nTo address these issues, others have used a third-party observer to give a rating of the rapport to a particular segment of the interaction, often called a \"slice\". Other recent work uses techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to computationally detect the level of rapport between members of a dyad.\n\n\n"}

Robert is celebrated as one of the greatest Tanzanian Swahili thinkers, intellectuals and writers in East Africa and has been called \"poet laureate of Swahili\" and is also known as the \"Father of Swahili.\" He is also honoured as the national poet.\n\nShaaban was born in the sleepy village of Vibamba, south of Tanga City in Tanzania (then German East Africa). The surname Robert is a name of a British colonial officer who requested his parent to name him after him. Thus in real sense, Robert was his second name (not his surname or last name), his first name being Shaaban. Shaaban himself for a time wrote it 'Roberts' rather than 'Robert'. From 1922 to 1926 he was educated in Dar es Salaam, coming in second in a class of 11 to receive the School Leaving Certificate under the then British colonial educational system in Tanganyika.\n\nAfter receiving the school certificate, Shaaban worked at various posts as a colonial government civil servant. From 1926 to 1944 he was a customs official at different locations throughout the territory. From 1944 to 1946 he worked for the Game Department. From 1946 to 1952 he worked in the Tanga District Office, and from 1952 to 1960 he was in the Survey Office there. He worked very closely with the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) and Julius Nyerere. Many of his civil service experiences are woven into his writings. During his lifetime he received the Margaret Wrong Prize and Medal for African Literature and was honored by the British government as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (M.B.E.).\n\nRobert contributed to the promotion of the Swahili language and the struggle for the dignity of mankind. He was a celebrated humanist. He worked for freedom and gender equality, and was against racial and religious discrimination in Tanzania. Tanzania's first president, Julius Nyerere, had complete admiration for the late Shaaban Robert, and greatly valued and promoted his intellectual work. His was also equally respectful of both Muslims and Christians. That is reflected in his two unusual names (Shaaban—Muslim name and Robert, a Christian name).[The name Robert was in fact one of his father's several names, the others being Selemani and Ufukwe]\n\nSheikh Shaaban Robert succeeded in writing essays, books, prose and poems and some of his literature is part of school curricula and higher education reading.

{"id": "531217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531217", "title": "Slut", "text": "Slut\n\nSlut is generally a term for a woman or girl who is considered to have loose sexual morals or who is sexually promiscuous. It is usually used as an insult, sexual slur or offensive term of disparagement (slut-shaming). It originally meant \"a dirty, slovenly woman\", and is rarely used to refer to men, generally requiring clarification by use of the terms \"male slut\" or \"man whore\".\n\nThe first recorded use of the word was a reference to a man, in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\", in which he is referring to the man's untidy appearance. \n\n\"Slut-shaming\" is a related term, referring to the act of drawing attention to a person's promiscuous behavior for the purpose of shaming them socially. From the late 20th century, there have been attempts to reclaim the word, exemplified by various SlutWalk parades, and some individuals embrace the title as a source of pride.\n\nThe common denotative meanings are a sexually promiscuous woman, or \"an immoral or dissolute woman; prostitute.\" These definitions identify a slut as a woman of low character—a person who lacks the ability or chooses not to exercise a power of discernment to order her affairs. Similar terms used for men are \"cad\", \"rake\", \"male slut\", \"man whore\", himbo, \"womanizer\", \"stud\", and \"player\". The adjective \"slutty\" carries a similar connotation, but can be applied both to people and to clothing and accessories, such as Halloween costumes.\n\nAlthough the ultimate origin of the word \"slut\" is unknown, it first appeared in Middle English in 1402 as \"slutte\" (AHD), with the meaning \"a dirty, untidy, or slovenly woman\". Even earlier, Geoffrey Chaucer used the word \"sluttish\" (c. 1386) to describe a slovenly man; however, later uses appear almost exclusively associated with women. The modern sense of \"a sexually promiscuous woman\" dates to at least 1450. The word was originally used around 1450 in the late Middle English language. It was used to describe a woman as dirty, or refer to her as a prostitute, harlot, or immoral woman. The word slut also took a similar form around the same era in the Norwegian language as \"slutr\" sleet, also known as an impure liquor.\n\nAnother early meaning was \"kitchen maid or drudge\" (c. 1450), a meaning retained as late as the 18th century, when hard knots of dough found in bread were referred to as \"slut's pennies\". A notable example of this use is Samuel Pepys's diary description of his servant girl as \"an admirable slut\" who \"pleases us mightily, doing more service than both the others and deserves wages better\" (February 1664). \"Slut\" and \"slutishness\" occur in Shakespeare's comedy \"As You Like It\", written in 1599 or 1600. In the nineteenth century, the word was used as a euphemism in place of \"bitch\" in the sense of a female dog.\n\nToday, the term \"slut\" has a pervasive presence in popular culture and pornography, but is almost exclusively used to describe women. An exact male equivalent of the term does not exist. The lack of a comparably popular term for men highlights the double standard in societal expectations (gender roles) between males and females, as negative terms for sexually promiscuous males are rare. Out of the 220 terms ascribed to females and 20 terms ascribed to males, all female terms are disapproving while some male terms signal approval or praise; these include \"stud\", \"player\", and \"man whore\". While colloquial terms such as \"male slut\" or \"man whore\" are used in popular culture, it is usually used in a joking manner. There are, however, other terms that can be used to criticize men for their sexuality. For example, a man's masculinity can be undermined by using terms such as \"weak\", \"sissy\", \"pussy,\" or \"whipped.\" They also dismiss female-on-male abuse, and are just as powerful and representative of modern societal prejudices. Hence, women may find it difficult to hold high positions at their workplace, whereas men may be mocked for choosing to be stay-at-home fathers. Although a sexually active and professionally successful woman might be seen as a threat, a man without those qualities is often regarded with suspicion and questions about his sexuality.\n\nThe word \"slut\" is commonly interchanged with the words \"tramp\", \"whore\", \"hoe\", \"nympho\", and \"hooker.\" All of these words have a very negative connotation. Additional meanings and connotations of the term are negative and identify a slut as being a slovenly and ugly person, for example, as in these quotations from OED2:\nThe attack on the character of the person is perhaps best brought together by the highly suggestive and related compound word, \"slut's-hole\", meaning a place or receptacle for rubbish; the associated quote provides a sense of this original meaning:\n\n\"Slut\" can also be used as verb to denote behavior characterized as that of a slut. For example, in the 1972 play, \"That Championship Season\", by Jason Miller, contained the exchange:\n\n\"All Women's Talk\" posted an article titled \"10 Signs You Might Be a Slut...\" Some of the noted signs included \"you don't go on real dates\", \"you dress provocatively\", and \"you have an STD.\" These are the common misconceptions and stereotypes that are attached to this word.\n\nThe word \"slut\" is used as a slang term in the BDSM, polyamorous, and gay and bisexual communities. A parallel exists between the female term \"slut\" and the term \"gay\" for males. Unlike women, who are usually policed for being sexually promiscuous, men are often criticized for not being masculine or dominant enough, thus questioning their heterosexuality. Unlike women, who are expected to be sexually chaste, men are expected to be sexually active, thus having more sexual freedom. Although \"slut\" is rarely used to describe heterosexual men, it is commonly used among gay males. When discussing sexual activity, \"slut\" is used to shame gay men for taking sexual risks, such as unprotected sex or having multiple partners. However, if used in a humorous way, \"slut\" may also favor sexual freedom and mark the shift from traditional gender roles in gay men.\n\nWith BDSM, polyamorous, and non-monogamous people, in usage taken from the book \"The Ethical Slut\", the term has been used as an expression of choice to openly have multiple partners, and revel in that choice: \"a slut is a person of any gender who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that \"sex is nice and pleasure is good for you\".\" A \"slut\" is a person who has taken control of their sexuality and has sex with whomever they choose, regardless of religious or social pressures or conventions to conform to a straight-laced monogamous lifestyle committed to one partner for life. \n\nThe term has been reappropriated to express the rejection of the concept that government, society, or religion may judge or control one's personal liberties, and the right to control one's own sexuality. In April 2013, Emily Lindin, founder of the UnSlut Project, created a blog to share her stories on sexual bullying to “provide some perspective to girls who currently feel trapped and ashamed\". The blog now consists of entries from members of all ages, ethnicities, and genders. The film, \"UnSlut: A Documentary Film\", coincides with the project and is screened across the country.\n\nSlut shaming in college is related to \"class, gender, culture, media, feminism, ethnicity, religion and sexuality. This is usually related to \"slut-labeling\"; the word is used to define one individual's sexuality and his or her attitude towards sexuality. The word \"dress code\" is being viewed as slut shaming because it creates a double standard for people, especially women.\n\nThe double standard associated with \"slut-labeling\" is part of the modern day rape culture. Rape culture is \"the casual debasement [of women] ... that has become such a part of our lives that it is often invisible.\" Though people in society are vocally anti-rape, there is an insinuation that certain types of rape are acceptable or that women are voluntarily taking actions that justify sexual advances. \"For example, women continue to be blamed if they are raped because of how they are dressed, the assumption that women purportedly lie about being raped remains popular, and certain women, such as married women or women of colour, are still considered 'unrapeable'”. The word \"slut\" and the double standard it contains reflects the gender norms and gender biases that are prevalent in a culture in which rape is constantly justified. People from all sects of society contribute to this justification.\n\nThere have been many movements or \"SlutWalks\" taking place around the world to regain a sense of pride in women. Many slut walks or movements protest against the idea that a woman's appearance, often considered promiscuous, is a justification of sexual assault and rape. The participants in these walks protest against individuals that excuse rape due to the woman's appearance, including victim blaming and slut shaming; slut walks have now become a worldwide movement.\n\nThe word \"slut\" means different things to white women and people of color, especially black women. \"Slut\" has different associations for black women. Anna North of \"The New York Times\" covered Leora Tanenbaum who stated, \"As Black women, we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves 'slut' without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the Black woman is.\" She argued that, for black women, the word \"slut\" does not mean anything very harmful due to the history of being treated as slaves in the past. Black women's \"relationship to the term \"slut\"\" is informed by a history of racism and slavery, of \"having been seen as objects of property, not just for the sexual gratification of those in power but also for reproduction of whole generations of slaves, which involved rape most of the time.\"\n\nMost of the SlutWalks were coordinated by white women, and black women felt uncomfortable when joining the slut walk. Scholar Jo Reger stated, \"Women of color ... argued that the white women organizers and participants had not considered the ways in which the sexuality of women of color had been constructed through a history of oppression, rape, and sexual exploitation.\" People of color, especially black people, had been avoiding words like \"slut\", \"jezebel\", \"hottentot\", \"mammy\", \"mule\", \"sapphire\", or \"welfare queens\". Starting the SlutWalk meant black people had to face all these words that used to be used against them.\n\nModel and actress Amber Rose was one of the first people to conduct and take a lead for a SlutWalk for people of color. \"The Amber Rose SlutWalk Festival is a completely inclusive space. This event is a zero tolerance event and we do not condone hateful language, racism, sexism, ableism, fat-shaming, transphobia or any other kind of bigotry. Further, we recognize that shaming, oppression, assault and violence have disproportionately impacted marginalized groups, including women of color, transgender people and sex workers, and thus we are actively working to center these groups at our events.\"\n\n\n"}

At the time of Spanish contact, it was the principal language throughout the Caribbean. Classic Taíno (Taíno proper) was the native language of the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and most of Hispaniola, and it was expanding into Cuba. Ciboney is essentially unattested, but colonial sources suggest that it was a dialect of Taíno and was spoken in westernmost Hispaniola, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and most of Cuba.\n\nBy the late 15th century, Taíno had displaced earlier languages except in western Cuba and pockets in Hispaniola. As the Taíno culture declined during Spanish colonization, the language was replaced by Spanish and other European languages. It is believed to have been extinct within 100 years of contact but possibly continued to be spoken in isolated pockets in the Caribbean until the late 19th century. As the first indigenous language encountered by Europeans in the New World, it was a major source of new words borrowed into European languages.\n\nGranberry & Vescelius (2004) distinguish two dialects, one on Hispaniola and further east, and the other on Hispaniola and further west.\n\n\nColumbus says that from Bahama to Cuba, Boriquen to Jamaica, the same language was spoken in various slight dialects, but understood by all.\n\nThe Taíno language was not written. The Taínos used petroglyphs, but there has been little research in the area. The following phonemes are reconstructed from Spanish records:\n\nThere was also a flap , which appears to have been an allophone of .\n\nA distinction between and is suggested by Spanish transcriptions of \"e\" vs \"ei/ey\", as in \"ceiba\" \"ceiba\". The is written \"ei\" or final \"é\" in modern reconstructions. There was also a high back vowel , which was often interchangeable with and may have been an allophone.\n\nThere was a parallel set of nasal vowels. The only consonant at the end of a syllable or of a word was .\n\nTaíno is very poorly attested. \nNouns appear to have had noun-class suffixes, as in other Arawakan languages. Attested Taíno possessive prefixes are \"da-\" 'my', \"wa-\" 'our', \"li-\" 'his' (sometimes with a different vowel), and \"to-, tu-\" 'her'.\n\nVerb-designating affixes are \"a-, ka-, -a, -ka, -nV\" in which \"V\" is an unknown or changeable vowel. This suggests that, like many other Arawakan languages, verbal conjugation for a subject resembled the possessive prefixes on nouns. \n\nThe Taíno language had an SVO word order which might be hard to see when copulas are being used. Often, however, words can be placed around quite freely. For example, \"Dawaria Boriken\" (\"I-from [Puerto Rico]\") can also be arranged as \"Boriken dawaria\" (\"I-[Puerto Rico]-from\"). What is of most concern in word order for the Taíno language nowadays is the most practical way to speak it; This tends to favor the least agglutinative approach.\n\nThe negation prefix is \"ma-\" meanwhile the attributive prefix is \"ka-\" as in \"makabuka\" \"it is not important or not important\". But literally means \"Negation-attributive-past\" or \"Without past\"\n\nSome conjugated verbs include \"Daka\" (I am), \"Weiba\" (We go), \"Warike\" (We see)\nAttested object suffix includes \"-wo\" (we, us) as in \"Ahiyawoka\" (Speak to us)\nEnglish words derived from Taino are: canoe, cassava, cay, hammock, hurricane, iguana, macana, maize, and potato, as well as possibly mangrove, tobacco, and savanna.\n\nTaino loanwords in Spanish are: aguti, aji, cacique, maguey, nigua, tiburon, tuna.\n\nTaíno etymologies of place names:\n\n\n"}
