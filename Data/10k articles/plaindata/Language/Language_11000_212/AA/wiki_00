An ASG is at a higher level of abstraction than an abstract syntax tree (or AST), which is used to express the syntactic structure of an expression or program.\n\nASGs are more complex and concise than ASTs because they may contain shared subterms (also known as \"common subexpressions\"). Abstract semantic graphs are often used as an intermediate representation by compilers to store the results of performing common subexpression elimination upon abstract syntax trees. ASTs are trees and are thus incapable of representing shared terms. ASGs are usually directed acyclic graphs. However, they may contain cycles, particularly in the field of graph rewriting. Graphs that contain cycles may represent recursive expressions which are commonly used to express iteration in functional programming languages without looping constructs.\n\nThe nomenclature \"term graph\" is associated with the field of term graph rewriting, which involves the transformation and processing of expressions by the specification of rewriting rules, whereas \"abstract semantic graph\" is used when discussing linguistics, programming languages, type systems and compilation.\n\nAbstract syntax trees are not capable of representing shared subexpressions due to their simplistic structure; this simplicity comes at a cost of efficiency due to redundant duplicate computations of identical terms. For this reason ASGs are often used as an intermediate language at a subsequent compilation stage to abstract syntax tree construction via parsing.\n\nAn abstract semantic graph is typically constructed from an abstract syntax tree by a process of enrichment and abstraction. The enrichment can for example be the addition of back-pointers, edges from an identifier node (where a variable is being used) to a node representing the declaration of that variable. The abstraction can entail the removal of details which are relevant only in parsing, not for semantics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26561880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26561880", "title": "Advocacy group", "text": "Advocacy group\n\nAdvocacy groups (also known as pressure groups, lobby groups, campaign groups, interest groups, or special interest groups) use various forms of advocacy in order to influence public opinion and/or policy. They have played and continue to play an important part in the development of political and social systems.\n\nMotives for action may be based on a shared political, religious, moral, health or commercial position. Groups use varied methods to try to achieve their aims including lobbying, media campaigns, publicity stunts, polls, research, and policy briefings. Some groups are supported or backed by powerful business or political interests and exert considerable influence on the political process, while others have few or no such resources.\n\nSome have developed into important social, political institutions or social movements. Some powerful advocacy groups have been accused of manipulating the democratic system for narrow commercial gain and in some instances have been found guilty of corruption, fraud, bribery, and other serious crimes; lobbying has become increasingly regulated as a result. Some groups, generally ones with less financial resources, may use direct action and civil disobedience and in some cases are accused of being a threat to the social order or 'domestic extremists'. Research is beginning to explore how advocacy groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.\n\nAn advocacy group is a group or an organization which tries to influence the government but does not hold power in the government.\n\nThe early growth of pressure groups was connected to broad economic and political changes in England in the mid-18th century, including political representation, market capitalization, and proletarianization. The first mass social movement catalyzed around the controversial political figure, John Wilkes. As editor of the paper \"The North Briton\", Wilkes vigorously attacked the new administration of Lord Bute and the peace terms that the new government accepted at the 1763 Treaty of Paris at the end of the Seven Years' War. Charged with seditious libel, Wilkes was arrested after the issue of a general warrant, a move that Wilkes denounced as unlawful – the Lord Chief Justice eventually ruled in Wilkes favour. As a result of this episode, Wilkes became a figurehead to the growing movement for popular sovereignty among the middle classes – people began chanting, \"Wilkes and Liberty\" in the streets.\n\nAfter a later period of exile, brought about by further charges of libel and obscenity, Wilkes stood for the Parliamentary seat at Middlesex, where most of his support was located. When Wilkes was imprisoned in the King's Bench Prison on 10 May 1768, a mass movement of support emerged, with large demonstrations in the streets under the slogan \"No liberty, no King.\" Stripped of the right to sit in Parliament, Wilkes became an Alderman of London in 1769, and an activist group called the \"Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights\" began aggressively promoting his policies. This was the first ever sustained social advocacy group;—it involved public meetings, demonstrations, the distribution of pamphlets on an unprecedented scale and the mass petition march. However, the movement was careful not to cross the line into open rebellion;—it tried to rectify the faults in governance through appeals to existing legal precedents and was conceived of as an extra-Parliamentary form of agitation to arrive at a consensual and constitutional arrangement. The force and influence of this social advocacy movement on the streets of London compelled the authorities to concede to the movement's demands. Wilkes was returned to Parliament, general warrants were declared as unconstitutional and press freedom was extended to the coverage of Parliamentary debates.\n\nAnother important advocacy group that emerged in the late 18th century was the British abolitionist movement against slavery. Starting with an organised sugar boycott in 1791, it led the second great petition drive of 1806, which brought about the banning of the slave trade in 1807. In the opinion of Eugene Black (1963), \"...association made possible the extension of the politically effective public. Modern extra parliamentary political organization is a product of the late eighteenth century [and] the history of the age of reform cannot be written without it.\n\nFrom 1815, Britain after victory in the Napoleonic Wars entered a period of social upheaval characterised by the growing maturity of the use of social movements and special-interest associations. Chartism was the first mass movement of the growing working-class in the world. It campaigned for political reform between 1838 and 1848 with the People's Charter of 1838 as its manifesto – this called for universal suffrage and the implementation of the secret ballot, amongst other things. The term \"social movements\" was introduced in 1848 by the German Sociologist Lorenz von Stein in his book \"Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848)\" in which he introduced the term \"social movement\" into scholarly discussions – actually depicting in this way political movements fighting for the social rights understood as welfare rights.\nThe labor movement and socialist movement of the late 19th century are seen as the prototypical social movements, leading to the formation of communist and social democratic parties and organisations. These tendencies were seen in poorer countries as pressure for reform continued, for example in Russia with the Russian Revolution of 1905 and of 1917, resulting in the collapse of the Czarist regime around the end of the First World War.\n\nIn the post-war period, women's rights, gay rights, peace, civil rights, anti-nuclear and environmental movements emerged, often dubbed the New Social Movements, some of which may be considered \"general interest groups\" as opposed to special interest groups. They led, among other things, to the formation of green parties and organisations influenced by the new left. Some find in the end of the 1990s the emergence of a new global social movement, the anti-globalization movement. Some social movement scholars posit that with the rapid pace of globalization, the potential for the emergence of new \"type\" of social movement is latent—they make the analogy to national movements of the past to describe what has been termed a global citizens movement.\n\nAdvocacy groups exist in a wide variety of genres based upon their most pronounced activities.\n\nIn most liberal democracies, advocacy groups tend to use the bureaucracy as the main channel of influence – because, in liberal democracies, this is where the decision-making power lies. The aim of advocacy groups here is to attempt to influence a member of the legislature to support their cause by voting a certain way in the legislature. Access to this channel is generally restricted to groups with insider status such as large corporations and trade unions – groups with outsider status are unlikely to be able to meet with ministers or other members of the bureaucracy to discuss policy. What must be understood about groups exerting influence in the bureaucracy is; \"the crucial relationship here [in the bureaucracy] is usually that between the senior bureaucrats and leading business or industrial interests\". This supports the view that groups with greater financial resources at their disposal will generally be better able to influence the decision-making process of government. The advantages that large businesses have is mainly due to the fact that they are key producers within their countries economy and, therefore, their interests are important to the government as their contributions are important to the economy. According to George Monbiot, the influence of big business has been strengthened by \"the greater ease with which corporations can relocate production and investment in a global economy\". This suggests that in the ever modernising world, big business has an increasing role in influencing the bureaucracy and in turn, the decision-making process of government.\n\nAdvocacy groups can also exert influence through the assembly by lobbying. Groups with greater economic resources at their disposal can employ professional lobbyists to try and exert influence in the assembly. An example of such a group is the environmentalist group Greenpeace; Greenpeace (an organisation with income upward of $50,000,000) use lobbying to gain political support for their campaigns. They raise issues about the environment with the aim of having their issues translated into policy such as the government encouraging alternative energy and recycling.\n\nThe judicial branch of government can also be used by advocacy groups to exert influence. In states where legislation cannot be challenged by the courts, like the UK, advocacy groups are limited in the amount of influence they have. In states that have codified constitutions, like the USA, however, advocacy group influence is much more significant. For example, – in 1954 the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) lobbied against the Topeka Board of education, arguing that segregation of education based on race was unconstitutional. As a result of group pressure from the NAACP, the supreme court unanimously ruled that racial segregation in education was indeed unconstitutional and such practices were banned. This is a novel example of how advocacy groups can exert influence in the judicial branch of government.\n\nAdvocacy groups can also exert influence on political parties. The main way groups do this is through campaign finance. For instance; in the UK, the conservative parties campaigns are often funded by large corporations, as many of the conservative parties campaigns reflect the interests of businesses. For example, George W. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004 was the most expensive in American history and was financed mainly by large corporations and industrial interests that the Bush administration represented in government. Conversely, left-wing parties are often funded by organised labour – when the British Labour Party was formed, it was largely funded by trade unions. Often, political parties are actually formed as a result of group pressure, for example, the Labour Party in the UK was formed out of the new trade-union movement which lobbied for the rights of workers.\n\nAdvocacy groups also exert influence through channels that are separate from the government or the political structure such as the mass media and through public opinion campaigning. Advocacy groups will use methods such as protesting, petitioning and civil disobedience to attempt to exert influence in Liberal Democracies. Groups will generally use two distinct styles when attempting to manipulate the media – they will either put across their outsider status and use their inability to access the other channels of influence to gain sympathy or they may put across a more ideological agenda. Traditionally, a prime example of such a group were the trade-unions who were the so-called \"industrial\" muscle. Trade-unions would campaign in the forms of industrial action and marches for workers rights, these gained much media attention and sympathy for their cause. In the United States, the Civil Rights Movement gained much of its publicity through civil disobedience; African Americans would simply disobey the racist segregation laws to get the violent, racist reaction from the police and white Americans. This violence and racism was then broadcast all over the world, showing the world just how one sided the race 'war' in America actually was.\n\nAdvocacy group influence has also manifested itself in supranational bodies that have arisen through globalisation. Groups that already had a global structure such as Greenpeace were better able to adapt to globalisation. Greenpeace, for example, have offices in over 30 countries and has an income of $50 million annually. Groups such as these have secured the nature of their influence by gaining status as nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), many of which oversee the work of the UN and the EU from their permanent offices in America and Europe. Group pressure by supranational industries can be exerted in a number of ways: \"through direct lobbying by large corporations, national trade bodies and 'peak' associations such as the European Round Table of Industrialists\".\n\nThere have been many significant advocacy groups throughout history, some of which could operated with dynamics that could better categorize them as social movements. Here are some notable advocacy groups operating in different parts of the world:\n\nOn some controversial issues there are a number of competing advocacy groups, sometimes with very different resources available to them:\n\nA general theory is that individuals must be enticed with some type of benefit to join an interest group. However, the free rider problem addresses the difficulty of obtaining members of a particular interest group when the benefits are already reaped without membership. For instance, an interest group dedicated to improving farming standards will fight for the general goal of improving farming for every farmer, even those who are not members of that particular interest group. Thus, there is no real incentive to join an interest group and pay dues if the farmer will receive that benefit anyway. For another example, every individual in the world would benefit from a cleaner environment, but an environmental protection interest groups do not receive monetary help from every individual in the world.\n\nThis poses a problem for interest groups, which require dues from their members and contributions in order to accomplish the groups' agendas. \n\nSelective benefits are material, rather than monetary benefits conferred on group members. For instance, an interest group could give members travel discounts, free meals at certain restaurants, or free subscriptions to magazines, newspapers, or journals. Many trade and professional interest groups tend to give these types of benefits to their members. \n\nA solidary incentive is a reward for participation that is socially derived and created out of the act of association. A selective solidary benefit offered to members or prospective members of an interest group might involve such incentives as \"socializing congeniality, the sense of group membership and identification, the status resulting from membership, fun, conviviality, the maintenance of social distinctions, and so on. \n\nPeople who join an interest group because of expressive benefits likely joined to express an ideological or moral value that they believe in, such as free speech, civil rights, economic justice, or political equality. To obtain these types of benefits, members would simply pay dues, and donate their time or money to get a feeling of satisfaction from expressing a political value. Also, it would not matter if the interest group achieved their goal; these members would merely be able to say they helped out in the process of trying to obtain their goals, which is the expressive incentive that they got in the first place. The types of interest groups that rely on expressive benefits or incentives are environmental groups and groups who claim to be lobbying for the public interest.\n\nSome public policy interests are not recognized or addressed by a group at all. These interests are labeled latent interests.\n\nMuch work has been undertaken by academics attempting to categorize how advocacy groups operate, particularly in relation to governmental policy creation. The field is dominated by numerous and diverse schools of thought:\n\nA study published in early 2012 suggests that advocacy groups of varying political and ideological orientations operating in the United States are using social media to interact with citizens every day. The study surveyed 53 groups, that were found to be using a variety of social media technologies to achieve organizational and political goals:\nAs noted in the study, \"while some groups raised doubts about social media’s ability to overcome the limitations of weak ties and generational gaps, an overwhelming majority of groups see social media as essential to contemporary advocacy work and laud its democratizing function.\"\n\n\n"}

An Adyghe word, besides that it has its own lexical meaning, sometimes, by the set of morphemes it is built of and by their aggregate grammatical meanings, can reproduce a sentence. For example, a verb by its set of morphemes can express subject's and object's person, place, time, manner of action, negative, and other types of grammatical categories. For example: къыпфэсхьыщтэп \"I will not bring it for you\" consists of these morphemes: къы-п-фэ-с-хьы-щт-эп – which have these literal meanings \"from there (къы) you (п) for you (фэ) I (с) bring (хьы) will (attribute of the future tense - щт) not (эп)\".\n\nIn Adyghe there are two kind of prefixes : Directional prefixes and informative prefixes. Directional prefixes express the direction of the verb while informative prefixes add additional information related to the verb like the location, the reason and the participants.\n\nDirectional prefixes express the movement of the object and the direction of the verb.\n\nThe verbal suffix ~лъ (~ɬ) designates action directed towards someone or something. for example:\n\n\nTo indicate a verb that was done backwards, the prefix зэкӏ- (zat͡ʃʼ-) is added. It indicates that the verb was done toward behind the subject, for example:\n\n\nThe verbal prefix блэ~ /bɮa~/ designates action bypass someone or something for example:\n\nThe verbal prefix пхы~ (пхыры~) (pxə~) designates action, motion directed through some obstacle, object; for example:\n\n\nThe verbal prefix шъхьапы~ /ʂħaːpə~/ designates movement of an object beyond something. Transference of an object beyond something. for example:\n\n\nThe verbal prefix шъхьадэ~ /ʂħaːda~/ designates movement of an object over something. Transference of an object over something. for example:\n\n\nThe verbal prefix шӏохэ~ /ʃʷʼaxa~/ designates action directed to the neck for example:\n\nInformative prefixes add additional information related to the verb like the location, the reason and the participants.\n\nThe prefix къэ~ /qa~/ can also be used to add a tinge of definiteness to the verb. In this case the verb does not necessarily have to be done towards the speaker. For example:\n\nThe verbal suffix гъэ~ (ʁ~) designates causation; rendered by the verbs. It designates that the object was forced to, compelled to, made to, was ordered to, was allowed to, was permitted to, was given the opportunity to do something. Verbs receive an additional argument in the causative construction, i.e. their valence is increased by one. All Adyghe verbs can form the causative, including intransitives, transitives, and ditransitives.\n\nExamples :\n\nBy adding prefix гъэ- (ʁa-), it is possible to create transitive verbs from nouns, adjectives and intransitive verbs.\n\nExamples :\n\nAdyghe allows \"double causatives\", i.e. the causative suffix can be added to a transitive verb that has already been derived by causativization: thus the causative гъэжъон /ʁaʒʷan/ \"make boil, cook\" can be causativized to гъэгъэжъон /ʁaʁaʒʷan/ \"make someone cook\", taking three arguments.\n\nA verb that one does to himself has the prefix зыгъэ~ /zəʁa~/\n\nExamples :\n\nTo indicate the time a certain verb was done, the prefix з~ (z~) and the past tense suffix ~гъэ (~ʁa) are added. To indicate the time the verb gonna happen, the prefix з~ (z~) and the future tense suffix ~щтэ (~ɕta) are added. For example:\n\n\nTo indicate an event, a plan or something that gonna happen after a certain verb will take place, will have the prefix з- (z-) and the conditional suffix -кӏэ (-t͡ʃʼa) (-гьэ in Shapsug dialect and -джэ in Bzhedugh dialect). For example:\n\n\nTo indicate an event that happened after a certain verb took place on a certain time, the prefix з- (z-) and suffix -эм (-am) are added. For example:\n\n\nThe verbal prefix щ~ (ɕ~) designates abode/residence somewhere. It is used to indicate the location or place an action occurred. For example:\n\nThe verbal prefix дэ~ (da~) designates action performed jointly with somebody, or stay/sojourn with somebody, for example:\n\n\nThe prefix фэ~ /fa~/ designates action performed to please somebody, for somebody's sake or in somebody's interests.\n\n\nThe verbal prefix шӏо~ (ʃʷʼa~) designates action done against somebody's will or interest. It also designates that the action was done to take an object or an opportunity away from somebody else, for example:\n\n\nIt can be understood from the sentence that \"the boy (кӏалэ) is eating the apple (мыӏэрыс) to take away my opportunity to eat it myself\".\n\nThe verbal prefix ӏэкӏэ~ (ʔat͡ʃʼa~) denotes unintentional actions or actions that occurred unexpectedly.\n\nTo indicate the tool or instrument the verb was done with, the prefix (ре-) (raj-) is added\n\n\nTo indicate a verb that the subject does to himself, the suffix зэ- (za-) is added. verbs in reflexive also usually have the suffix -жьы (-ʑə).\n\n\nIt can also be used to indicate a verb that some subjects (more than one; group) do to themselves.\n\nTo indicate a verb that is done by some subjects (more than one; group) together, the suffix зэдэ~ (zada~) is added.\n\n\nTransitive verb in the reciprocal form expresses that its two core arguments (the Actor and the Undergoer) act on each other simultaneously. The reciprocal form has the prefix зэры~ (zara~), for example:\n\n\nTo indicate the way a certain action is performed, the prefix зэрэ~ (zara~) and the suffix ~рэ /~ra/ are added.\n\n\nThe prefix зэрэ~ (zara~) and the suffix ~рэ /~ra/ can also be used to indicate a fact.\n\n\nTo indicate an event that happened instantly at the beginning of a certain verb, the prefix зэрэ- (zara-) and the suffix -эу / -ыу (-aw/-əw) are added. Can only be used on verbs and nouns.\n\n\nIt is posited most often before root of verb, after all other prefixes.\n\nWhen to use this Prefix :\n\nумыкӀомэ /wəmkʷʼama/ \"if you don't go\", умыкӀорагъоми /wəmkʷʼaraːʁʷami/ \"even if you don't want to\n\ngo\", мамкӀуу /maːmkʷʼəw/ \"while he didn't want to go\".\n\nCannot be used simultaneously with both the negative prefix (мы~) (mə~) and the negative suffix (-п) (-p).\n\nTo indicate a verb that someone wishes to happen, the verbal infix ~рэ~ (~ra~) is added.\n\nExamples :\n\nQuestions are indicated by the suffix ~a /aː/, which, in verbs that end with /a/, lengthens the end vowel.\n\nIf question is posited to word having negative suffix ~п (~p), it is converted to suffix ~ба (~baː). for example:\n\n\nOptative mood is expressed with the complex suffix -гъо-т: у-кIуа-гъо-т \"would you go\", п-тхы-гъа-гъо-т \"would you write\".\n\nThe verbal suffix ~жь (~ʑ) designates recurrence/repetition of action. It can also be used to indicate an action that someone was doing before and now continuing it.\n\nExamples :\n\n\n\n\nThe verbal suffix ~жь (~ʑ) designates performance of the action directly, without the intervention of another agent.\n\nThe verbal suffix ~жь (~ʑ) also indicates an action that was done with a great delay, to the point it even might be too late or pointless.\n\nTo indicate to someone, not to bother doing a certain action, the negative infix ~мы~ (~mə~) and the suffix ~жьы (~ʑə) are added.\n\nThe verbal suffix ~гъах (~ʁaːx) designates absolute accomplishment/realization of the action.\n\n\nTo indicate an event that is happening after the absolute accomplishment/realization of an action, the suffixes ~гъах (~ʁaːx) and ~эу (~aw) are added. For example:\n\n\nTo indicate an event that happened after the absolute accomplishment/realization of an action, the suffixes -гъах (-ʁaːx) and -эм (-am) are added. For example:\n\n\nTo indicate not accomplishment/realization of an action, the suffix -гъах (-ʁaːx) and the negative suffix (~эп) (~ap) are added.\n\n\nTo indicate an event that is happening while a certain verb is done, the suffix ~эу (-aw) is added to the verb. Usually this suffix is added to present tense verbs regardless if the whole sentence is about the past or future. For example:\n\nThe verb with the suffix ~эу is usually followed by another verb that has a tense suffix indicating the time the sentence occurred. For example:\n\nTo indicate an action that occurred instead of another action, the action that did not happen is expressed in the present tense form and it gets the suffix ~эу and the negative infix ~мы~. For example:\n\nTo indicate something before a certain verb was done, the suffix ~эу and the negative infix ~мы~ are added. In this case the verb should also get the tense suffix indicating the time.\n\nIn addition to distinguishing between singular and plural nouns by marking the latter with the suffix '-хэ' .\n\n\nTo indicate a plural verb (verb that was done by more than one thing) also has the additional suffix '-хэ' .\n\nThe Negation suffix is ~п (~p) and it's ~рэп (~rap) when the verb is\n\nin present tense: \n\nTo indicate something desired, the suffix (~рагъу) (~raːʁʷ) is added For example:\n\nThe suffix ~шъу (~ʃʷə) designates the ability to perform the indicated action. It is used to indicated that the subject is able to carry out the indicated action. For example:\n\nWhen the suffix ~шъу (~ʃʷə) is used on adjectives or nouns, it is to indicate the possibility of what the indicated adjective or noun can be.\n\n\nTo indicate an event that will happen even if something/someone does a specific verb, has the Suffix ~ми (~məj).\n\n\nTo indicate a result of a certain verb that if someone/something done, doing or will do, has the Suffix -мэ (-ma).\n\n\nCan not be used simultaneously both the suffix -мэ (-ma) and the suffix -ми (-mi).\n\nThe conditional mood can be indicated by adding the suffix ~кӏэ (~t͡ʃʼ). For example: Натрыфыр зы мафэ-мэфит1у губгъэм еты-к1э, зи щыш1ыщтэп - If the corn will be in the field a day or two, nothing will happen to it.\n\nIt is mostly used with the time prefix з~:\n\nWhen the connective suffix ~и (-əj) is used on present tense verbs, it is to indicate a chain of different verbs that occurred in the past.\n\n\nWhen the suffix ~ни (-nəj) is used on present tense verbs, it is to indicate a chain of different verbs that will occur in the future or planned to be done in the future.\n\n\nWhen the connective suffix ~и (-əj) is used in imperative mood, it is to indicate a chain of different verbs that the listener(s) should do at that moment.\n\n\nWhen the suffix ~и (-əj) is added to past and future tense verbs, nouns and adjectives, it is to indicate the cause of a certain event.\n\n\nTo indicate an event that will happen until the verb is done, the verbal suffix ~фэ /~fa/ is added. For example:\n\n\nThe suffix ~нэс /~nas/ can also be used for the same meaning :\n\n\nThe verbal suffix ~хы /~xə/ designates action performed downwards or action performed towards a lower level :\n\nTo designate action in an upward direction, the prefix д~ (d~) and the verbal suffix ~е (ja) are added.\n\nThe suffix ~гу (~ɡʷ) designates that the indicated action was performed for a period of time. It might be used to indicated that the action will be performed quickly. For example:\n\nThis also can be add to noun and adjective :\n\nThe verbal suffix ~гъэет (~ʁajat) or ~гъагъэет (~ʁaːʁjat) or designates optative mood.\n\n\nTo indicate a diminution of degree (\"kind of\"), the suffix ~пашъу (~raːʃʷ) is added. It is mostly used on verbs and adjectives and are rarely used on noun.\n\n\nThe suffix -уи (-wəːj) indicates a surprise mood. \n\nTo indicate an event that happened in the past after a certain verb was done, the suffix -эм (-am) is added.\n\n\nTo indicate an event that is happening after a certain verb is done with no indication to the time it happened, the time prefix з~ and the suffix ~рэм (~ram) are added.\n\n\nTo indicate an event that happened right before a certain verb was going to be done, the suffix ~ным (~nəm) is added.\n\n\nThe verbal suffix ~рас (-raːs) designates recurrence, presence of a characteristic. It designates an action that someone often does. For example:\n\n\nTo indicate the subject or the object that usually or often do a certain verb, the suffix ~расэ (-raːsa) is added to the noun that was created from a verb. for example:\n\n\nTo indicate a verb that is about to happened, the verbal suffix -пэт (-pat) is added.\n\nTo indicate that the verb is always happen, the suffix -зэпыт (-zapət) is added.\n\nTo indicate a verb that happened just recently, the suffix -гъакӏ (-ʁaːt͡ʃʼ) is added.\n\n\nTo indicate a verb that the subject should have done in the past and haven't, the suffix -пхъагъ (-pχaːʁ) is added.\n\n\nThe verbal suffix ~хь /~ħ/ designates action performed on an area or repetition of the action in a certain area :\n\nThe reflexive verbal prefix зе~ (zaj~) and the verbal suffix ~хь(~ħ) are used together to indicate action performed by someone around the area or location they are standing in. It also designates repetition of the action around someone. for example:\n\nThe verbal prefix къе~ (qaj~) and the verbal suffix ~хь(~ħ) are used together to indicate action performed on an area, for example:\n\nTo indicate movement round an object, the prefix дэ~ (da~) and the suffix ~хь (~ħ) are added :\n\nThe suffix ~хь (~ħə) can also be used together with the positional prefixes to indicate action performed on a definite area in a certain direction and position. for example:\n\n\nThe verbal suffix ~хь(~ħ) can also be used to indicate action performed repetitively or action performed for a long extend or action performed nonstop (without interruption or break) or action performed entirely, for example:\n\nTo indicate the manner a verb is done, the verbal suffix ~кӏэ (t͡ʃʼa) is added. In the Shapsug dialect the suffix ~кӏьэ (~kʲʼa) is used instead.\n\n\nIt is also possible to indicate the manner in which someone does a verb. for example:\n\n\nTo indicate that a verb is Difficult to do, the suffix -гъуай (-ʁʷaːj) is added\n\n\nTo indicate that a verb is easy to do, the suffix -гъошӏу (-ʁʷaʃʷʼ) is added\n\n\nTo either warn or intimidate the listener(s) from doing a certain verb, the verbal suffix ~къон (~qʷan) is added to it.\n\n\nThe verbal suffix ~лӏ (~lʼ) designates action directed towards, or applied to somebody or something. For example: \n\nThe verbal suffix ~ӏо designates slightness; for example:\n\nThe verbal suffix ~хъу designates mistakenness; for example:\n\nThe verbal suffix ~п designates action done willingly; for example:\n\nThe verbal suffix ~хэ designates absolute; for example:\n\n"}

The Yurok are the largest Native American tribe in the U.S. state of California, with approximately 6,000 members.\n\nThompson was the oldest living Yurok and the last known native-born, active speaker of the Yurok language at the time of his death in 2013. He was the last of about twenty Yurok elders who worked to revitalize the Yurok language. He worked with academics and linguists to preserve and revitalize the language among younger Yurok generations throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Those same linguists had originally predicted that Yurok would be extinct by 2010 and Thompson received much of the credit for saving the language. Yurok is now taught in five high schools throughout Humboldt and Del Norte counties in northern California. While the language is still endangered, the effort to preserve Yurok is considered to be the most successful revitalization effort in California.\n\nThompson was born in a smokehouse on May 26, 1919 in Wa'tek Village (now known as Johnsons, California) in Humboldt County. He was sent to a government school in Hoopa, California, when he was five years old, where he was discouraged from speaking Yurok. He returned home when he was eight years old, but his mother soon tried to put him up for adoption. He was taken in by his grandmother, Rosie Jack Hoppell. Thompson was raised by his grandmother, who only spoke Yurok in her home, and his uncle. His relatives raised him in a traditional Yurok lifestyle. As a child, Thompson trapped ducks to fill feather mattresses, harvested seaweed, fished for eulachon and salmon, and tracked elk.\n\nThompson earned varsity letters in football, basketball, baseball and track at Del Norte High School in Crescent City, California, from which he graduated in 1939. Thompson was one of the first Native American students to have his name engraved on the Del Norte H.S. Coach's Cup, a school award which honors exception skills in multiple athletic sports. He attended the Sherman Institute, a Native American boarding school in Riverside, California, (now known as Sherman Indian High School) where he learned welding. He served in the United States Navy during World War II and was sent to the South Pacific.\n\nThompson and his wife, Alta McCash, a member of the Karuk people, moved to Crescent City in 1959. The couple had eight children before Alta died from complications of a fall in 1968.\n\nIn 2009, Thompson was awarded the Silver Honor in the Mentor Category from the MetLife Foundation and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging at a ceremony held in Washington D.C.\n\nArchie Thompson died from a stroke at a hospital in Crescent City on March 26, 2013, at the age of 93. He was survived by seven children, twenty-nine grandchildren, seventy-two great-grandchildren, and four great-great-grandchildren.\n"}

These include major minority languages with their own literary history, including Korean, Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Russian and Uyghur. The other languages of China are mainly tribal languages, mainly spoken in Yunnan in Southwest China.\n\nThe Bible was first translated into the Kachin language in Burma in 1927, by a Swedish Baptist missionary, Ola Hanson. Amity Press published the Jingpho Bible in 1989 and again in 2013.\n\nThe complete Bible was first published in Lahu in 1989.\n\nLisu is part of the Tibeto-Burman family. Samuel Pollard and James O. Fraser prepared simple Christian literature while they were in the first stages of learning the Miao and Lisu languages, later moving on to translating the New Testament. \n\nIn the Central Lisu dialect, Fraser, after creating the Fraser alphabet, first worked on Mark and John. He then handed on the translation task to Allyn Cooke and his wife, Leila, coming back to help the team with revision in the mid 1930s. Isobel Miller Kuhn also worked on the translation. The New Testament was finished in 1938, and the complete Bible in 1968.\n\nThe New Testament in Eastern Lisu, translated by George E. Metcalf, was first published in 1951 in Hong Kong, however no copies ever got back to Yunnan. The Old Testament in Eastern Lisu is not yet fully translated.\n\nSam Pollard began work translating the New Testament into the Large Flowery Miao language of northeastern Yunnan in 1906, publishing parts of it, however died of typhoid in 1917 before he could finish it. Colleagues completed the work. The book was typeset in Japan, and eventually 85,000 copies were distributed.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Miao Christian leaders decided to finish Pollard's work and translate the Old Testament. After discussion with the Yunnan Christian Council and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, semi-official organizations, a translation team was formed in Kunming. One question was whether to continue to use the Pollard script, which was familiar to Christians from their reading of older materials, or to use the new script promulgated by the government in 1956. In the end, a modified version of the old script was used. Since Pollard's Miao characters are not included in Unicode, standard computer word processing programs could not handle the text. Consultants from among the missionaries created keyboard shortcuts, but their unique characters could not be copied or the text checked. The new translation was launched at a ceremony in Kunming in September 2009, with an initial printing of 10,000 copies.\n\nThe Gospel of Mark was translated into Naxi, spoken in Yunnan, by Elise Schapten using the Pollard script and published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1932.\n\nThe New Testament in Wa was translated by Vincent Young and published in 1938 by the British and Foreign Bible Society. The entire Bible was completed by Wa Christians in the nineties, and a trial version was published. Since the trial version, the Bible Society of Myanmar has been worked on a thorough revision of the text, and a finalized Wa Bible was published in April 2012. Amity Press has published the New Testament in Wa, available on YouVersion.\n\nThe Bible was first translated into Xishuangbanna Dai in 1933.\n\nAmity Press has published the New Testament in Yi.\n\n\n"}

Šwjela advocated the preservation of Sorbian language and culture in the Lower Lausitz.\n\nAfter Šwjela had in 1898 completed his theological studies, he sought a long time for a pastoral position in the Lower Lausitz. Beginning in 1904, he was curate at the Wendish church in Cottbus, where he preached regularly in Lower Sorbian, rather than in German.\n\nHis ordination took place at a time when the oppression of Sorbian language and culture by the Prussian authorities peaked. Education in Sorbian at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Cottbus was stopped in 1888 and later religious instruction in the language was also stopped. The older Sorbian intellectuals were initially paralyzed. Šwjela, of the nationally conscious young Sorbian movement, was motivated strongly to work for the cultural interests of the Sorbs. Things came to a head in the Cottbus parish where he continued to minister in Sorbian. In 1908, Swjela had to leave the city because he had refused to hold sermons in German only. He was then several years as vicar in Nochten before he came to the Dissen parish in 1913.\n\nŠwjela's father, Kito Šwjela (1836–1922), had edited the Lower Sorbian newspaper \"Bramborski Serbski casnik\" beginning in 1864. Following in his father's journalistic footsteps, Šwjela wrote for the Lower Sorbian newspapers and magazines \"Pratyja\", \"Bramborski Casnik\", and \"Woßadnik\", whose main author was himself. He founded the series \"Serbska knigłownja\" (Sorbian Library), in which he published especially poetry but also published literary, religious and popular scientific works by different authors. Šwjela published his textbooks for teaching the Lower Sorbian language in two parts, in 1906 and 1911.\n\nŠwjela succeeded in motivating young Sorbs in his region to work on behalf of their traditional national cultural work. He strengthened them in their self-image by contacts in the Sorbian core areas of Oberlausitz.\n\nIn 1912 Šwjela co-founded the Sorbian umbrella organization Domowina. He suggested the name for the association, and was also elected Deputy Chairman. In the interwar period Šwjela collected the Sorbian geographical name in the Cottbus area and worked on a Lower Sorbian dictionary. Neither work was allowed to be printed until after his death.\n\nWith the increased power of the National Socialists (Nazis) from 1933 onward, the pressure on the small Slavic minority in Germany increased. The imposition of prohibitions of Sorbian language and some cultural expression began in Domowina in 1937, initiating open persecution of Sorbian life. From that year onward, no publications in Sorbian were allowed to be published. While in most Protestant congregations, services were not held in Sorbian, Šwjela refused to be intimidated. During the Nazi era, he led in the renovation of the church in Dissen, where the Sorbian quoations were again painted on the balcony. He preached in Dissen and Sielow in Sorbian, even though this was forbidden. On April 7, 1941, the Gestapo informed the leading Wendish pastor that all the Wendish pastors' association had been dissolved and its assets seized. Hymn singing, teaching, and preaching was required to be in German, both officially and in private. Therefore, Šwjela was forced to retire and was banished from the Lower Sorbian area of Lausitz to Rudolstadt. In his exile, Šwjela remained committed to the Sorbian cause. Together with earlier companions, including the journalist Mina Witkojc and the painter Fritz Lattke, he developed an important foundation for the revival of the Lower Sorbian culture in the postwar period.\n\nIn 1946 he was involved in the re-establishment of the Lower Sorbian branch of Domowina and since 1947 he was editor of the Lower Sorbian newspaper \"Nowy Casnik\". Before he found a new apartment in the Lower Sorbian region, Šwjela died in 1948 from a stroke on a railway journey from Rudolstadt to Cottbus. In Cottbus, a street was named in his honor him.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "481187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=481187", "title": "Chewa language", "text": "Chewa language\n\nChewa (), also known as Nyanja (), is a language of the Bantu language family. The noun class prefix \"chi-\" is used for languages, so the language is usually called Chichewa and Chinyanja (spelled \"Cinianja\" in Mozambique). In Malawi, the name was officially changed from Chinyanja to Chichewa in 1968 at the insistence of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda (himself of the Chewa tribe), and this is still the name most commonly used in Malawi today. In Zambia, the language is generally known as Nyanja or Cinyanja/Chinyanja '(language) of the lake' (referring to Lake Malawi).\n\nChewa belongs to the same language group (Guthrie Zone N) as Tumbuka, Sena, and Nsenga.\n\nChewa is the most widely known language of Malawi, spoken mostly in the Central and Southern Regions of that country. \"It is also one of the seven official African languages of Zambia, where it is spoken mostly in the Eastern Province. It is also spoken in Mozambique, especially in the provinces of Tete and Niassa, as well as in Zimbabwe where, according to some estimates, it ranks as the third-most widely used local language, after Shona and Northern Ndebele.\" It was one of the 55 languages featured on the Voyager spacecraft.\n\nThe Chewa were a branch of the Maravi people who lived in the Eastern Province of Zambia and in northern Mozambique as far south as the River Zambezi from the 16th century or earlier.\n\nThe name \"Chewa\" (in the form \"Chévas\") itself is first recorded by António Gamitto, who at the age of 26 in 1831 was appointed as second-in-command of an expedition from Tete to the court of King Kazembe in what is now Zambia. His route took him through the country of King Undi west of the Dzalanyama mountains, across a corner of present-day Malawi and on into Zambia. Later he wrote an account including some ethnographic and linguistic notes and vocabularies. According to Gamitto, the Malawi or Maravi people (\"Maraves\") were those ruled by King Undi south of the Chambwe stream (not far south of the present border between Mozambique and Zambia), while the Chewa lived north of the Chambwe.\n\nApart from a few words recorded by Gamitto, the first extensive record of the Chewa language was made by Johannes Rebmann in his \"Dictionary of the Kiniassa Language\", published in 1877 but written in 1853-4. Rebmann was a missionary living near Mombasa in Kenya, and he obtained his information from a Malawian slave, known by the Swahili name Salimini, who had been captured in Malawi some ten years earlier. Salimini, who came from a place called Mphande apparently in the Lilongwe region, also noted some differences between his own dialect (which he called \"Kikamtunda\", the language of the plateau) and the Maravi dialect (\"Kimaravi\") spoken further south; for example, the Maravi gave the name \"mombo\" to the tree which he himself called \"kamphoni\".\n\nThe first grammar, \"A Grammar of the Chinyanja language as spoken at Lake Nyasa with Chinyanja–English and English–Chinyanja vocabulary\", was written by Alexander Riddel in 1880. Further early grammars and vocabularies include \"A grammar of Chinyanja, a language spoken in British Central Africa, on and near the shores of Lake Nyasa\" by George Henry (1891) and M.E. Woodward's \"A vocabulary of English–Chinyanja and Chinyanja–English: as spoken at Likoma, Lake Nyasa\" (1895). The whole Bible was translated into the Likoma Island dialect of Nyanja by William Percival Johnson and published as \"Chikalakala choyera: ndicho Malangano ya Kale ndi Malangano ya Chapano\" in 1912. Another Bible translation, known as the \"Buku Lopatulika ndilo Mau a Mulungu\", was made in a more standard Central Region dialect about 1900-1922 by missionaries of the Dutch Reformed Mission and Church of Scotland with the help of some Malawians. This has recently (2016) been reissued in a revised and slightly modernised version.\n\nAnother early grammar, concentrating on the Kasungu dialect of the language, was Mark Hanna Watkins' \"A Grammar of Chichewa\" (1937). This book, the first grammar of an African language to be written by an American, was a work of cooperation between a young black PhD student and young student from Nyasaland studying in Chicago, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who in 1966 was to become the first President of the Republic of Malawi. This grammar was also the first to mark the tones of the words.\n\nIn recent years the language has changed considerably, and a dichotomy has grown between the traditional Chichewa of the villages and the language of city-dwellers.\n\nChewa has five vowel sounds: . Long or double vowels are sometimes found, e.g. \"áákúlu\" 'big' (class 2), \"kufúula\" 'to shout'. When a word comes at the end of a phrase, its penultimate vowel tends to be lengthened, except for non-Chewa names and words, such as \"Muthárika\" or \"ófesi\", in which the penultimate vowel always remains short. The added 'u' or 'i' in borrowed words such as \"láputopu\" 'laptop' or \"íntaneti\" 'internet' tends to be silent or barely pronounced.\n\nChewa consonants are sometimes followed by a vowel, sometimes by \"w\", and sometimes by \"y\":\n\n\nThe place of \"bya\" is taken by the palatalised affricate \"bza\", and the place of \"gya\" is taken by \"ja\".\n\nSome consonants can also be preceded by a homorganic nasal:\n\nThe possible consonant combinations can thus be arranged on a table as follows:\n\nThe spelling used here is that introduced in 1973, which is the one generally in use in the Malawi at the present time, replacing the \"Chinyanja Orthography Rules\" of 1931.\n\nNotes on the consonants\n\n\nLike most other Bantu languages, Chewa is a tonal language; that is to say, the pitch of the syllables (high or low) plays an important role in it. Tone is used in various ways in the language. First of all, each word has its own tonal pattern, for example:\n\nUsually there is only one high tone in a word (generally on one of the last three syllables), or none. However, in compound words there can be more than one high tone, for example:\n\nA second important use of tone is in the verb. Each tense of the verb has its own characteristic tonal pattern (negative tenses usually have a different pattern from positive ones). For example, the present habitual has high tones on the initial syllable and the penultimate, the other syllables being low:\n\nThe recent past continuous, on the other hand, has a tone on the third syllable:\n\nTones can also indicate whether a verb is being used in a main clause or in a dependent clause such as a relative clause:\n\nA third use of tones in Chewa is to show phrasing and sentence intonation. For example, immediately before a pause in the middle of a sentence the speaker's voice tends to rise up; this rise is referred to as a boundary tone. Other intonational tones are sometimes heard, for example a rising or falling tone at the end of a yes-no question.\n\nChewa nouns are divided for convenience into a number of classes, which are referred to by the Malawians themselves by names such as \"Mu-A-\", but by Bantu specialists by numbers such as \"1/2\", corresponding to the classes in other Bantu languages. Conventionally, they are grouped into pairs of singular and plural. However, irregular pairings are also possible, especially with loanwords; for example, \"bánki\" 'bank', which takes the concords of class 9 in the singular, has a plural \"mabánki\" (class 6).\n\nWhen assigning nouns to a particular class, initially the prefix of the noun is used. Where there is no prefix, or where the prefix is ambiguous, the concords (see below) are used as a guide to the noun class. For example, \"katúndu\" 'possessions' is put in class 1, since it takes the class 1 demonstrative \"uyu\" 'this'.\n\nSome nouns belong to one class only, e.g. \"tomáto\" 'tomato(es)' (class 1), \"mowa\" 'beer' (class 3), \"malayá\" 'shirt(s)' (class 6), \"udzudzú\" 'mosquito(es)' (class 14), and do not change between singular and plural. Despite this, such words can still be counted if appropriate: \"tomáto muwíri\" 'two tomatoes', \"mowa uwíri\" 'two beers', \"malayá amódzi\" 'one shirt', \"udzudzú umódzi\" 'one mosquito'.\n\nClass 11 (Lu-) is not found in Chewa. Words like \"lumo\" 'razor' and \"lusó\" 'skill' are considered to belong to class 5/6 (Li-Ma-) and take the concords of that class.\n\n\nInfinitive class:\n\nLocative classes:\n\nPronouns, adjectives, and verbs have to show agreement with nouns in Chichewa. This is done by means of prefixes, for example:\n\nClass 2 (the plural of class 1) is often used for respect when referring to elders. According to Corbett and Mtenje, a word like \"bambo\" 'father', even though it is singular, will take plural concords (e.g. \"bambo anga akuyenda, ndikuwaona\" 'my father is walking, I see him'); they note that to use the singular object-marker \"-mu-\" would be 'grossly impolite'.\n\nThe various prefixes are shown on the table below:\n\nAlthough there are 17 different noun classes, because some of them share concords there are in fact only 12 sets of prefixes.\n\nIn the examples below, the concords are illustrated with nouns of classes 1 and 2.\n\n\nThese are often shortened to \"mwanáyu\", \"mwanáyo\", \"anáwa\", \"anáwo\".\n\n\nIn class 2 and 6, \"o-\" often becomes \"wo-\" (e.g. \"wónse\" for \"ónse\" etc.).\n\n\nThe perfect tense (\"wapita\" 'he has gone') has different prefixes from the other tenses.\n\nThe relative pronoun \"améne\" and demonstrative \"améneyo\" use the same prefixes as a verb:\n\n\nNumeral prefixes are used with numbers one to five, and the words \"angáti?\" 'how many', \"angápo\" 'several':\n\n\nCertain adjectives (\"-kúlu\" 'big', \"-ng'óno\" 'small'; \"-(a)múna\" 'male', \"-kázi\" 'female'; \"-táli\" 'long', \"-fúpi\" 'short'; \"-wisi\" 'fresh') combine the possessive concord (\"wá\") and the number concord (\"m\"):\n\nEarly dictionaries, such as those of Rebmann, and of Scott and Hetherwick, show that formerly the number of concords was greater. The following changes have taken place:\n\nIn addition, classes 4 and 9, and classes 15 and 17 have identical concords, so the total number of concord sets (singular and plural) is now twelve.\n\nTenses in Chichewa are differentiated in two ways, by their tense-marker (or tense-infix), and by their tonal pattern. Sometimes two tenses have the same tense-marker and differ in their tonal pattern alone. In the following examples, the tense-marker is underlined:\n\nOne tense has no tense-marker:\n\nTenses can be modified further by adding certain other infixes, called 'aspect-markers', after the tense-marker. These are \"-má-\" 'always, usually' \"-ká-\" 'go and', \"-dzá\" 'come and' or 'in future', and \"-ngo-\" 'only', 'just'. These infixes can also be used on their own, as tense-markers in their own right (compare the use of \"-ma-\" and \"-dza-\" in the list of tenses above). For example:\n\nCompound tenses, such as the following, are also found in Chichewa:\n\nChichewa verbs (with the exception of the imperative mood and infinitive) begin with a prefix agreeing grammatically with the subject. This prefix is referred to by some grammarians as the 'subject-marker'.\n\nThe subject-marker can be:\n\nAn example of a locative subject-marker might be:\n\nAn object-marker can also optionally be added to the verb; if one is added it goes immediately before the verb-stem:\n\nThe object-marker can be:\n\nChewa has a large number of tenses, some of which differ in some respects from the tenses met with in European languages. For example, for referring to events which took place earlier today, either of the following two tenses may be used:\n\nThe difference between them is that the first one implies that the result of the event is still relevant (namely that the speaker still have the thing which I he or she bought), whereas the second one is used either when the result of the action isn't relevant (for example, if the speaker is narrating a series of events), or when there is a definite implication that the result no longer holds (namely in this case that although the speaker bought the thing, he or she no longer has it). Thus \"wapita\" means 'he has gone (and not yet returned)' while \"anapíta\" means 'he went (but has now returned)'. \n\nA similar pair of tenses are used when referring to events of yesterday or earlier:\n\nThe first of these would usually imply that the speaker still has the thing that was bought, while the second implies that he or she no longer has it. Thus the second verb of each pair, unlike the English simple past, which is neutral in implication, generally implies that the effect of the action is no longer evident. In other words, they belong to the type of tense known as discontinuous past. The two pairs are not quite parallel, since for narrating a series of events of earlier today, the Recent Past would be used, but for events of yesterday or earlier, the Remote Perfect.\n\nIn addition to the distinctions described above, Chichewa also distinguishes perfective from imperfective aspect in every tense; thus for example, \"ndi-na-gúla\" 'I bought' (event) is distinct from \"ndi-ma-gúla\" 'I was buying' (ongoing situation). In the present tense only, the imperfective is further subdivided into progressive and habitual aspects:\n\nThere are several future tenses. One future tense not found in European languages is the \"-ká-\" future, which 'might presuppose an unspoken conditional clause':\n\nThe following tenses refer to potentiality as well as time:\n\nThere are also two subjunctive mood tenses, as follows:\n\nNegative tenses, if they are main verbs, are made with the prefix \"sí-\". The tones of negative verbs usually differ from those of positive ones, and generally put a tone on the penultimate syllable, except in the present simple tense.

Dependent verbs often have a tone on the first syllable. Sometimes this change of tone alone is sufficient to show that the verb is being used in a dependent clause. Compare for example:\n\nOther commonly used dependent tenses are the following (the last of these is toneless):\n\nAfter the verb stem one or more extensions may be added. The extensions modify the meaning of the verb, for example:\n\nExtensions which have an intensive or stative meaning tend to have a high tone, e.g. \"yang'anitsitsá\" 'look carefully', \"pitirirá\" 'carry on, keep going', \"guliká\" 'be saleable, get bought'; however, there are some exceptions such as \"oneka\" 'seem'.\n\nMost extensions, apart from the reciprocal \"-ana\" 'one another', have two possible forms, e.g. \"-ira/-era\", \"-itsa/-etsa\", \"-ula/-ola\". The forms with \"e\" and \"o\" are used if the verb stem is monosyllabic or has an \"e\" or \"o\" in it, e.g.\n\nThe forms with \"i\" and \"u\" are used with the verb stem has \"a\", \"i\", or \"u\":\n\nThe following have written published stories, novels, or plays in the Chewa language:\n\n\nAn urban variety of Nyanja, sometimes called Town Nyanja, is the lingua franca of the Zambian capital Lusaka and is widely spoken as a second language throughout Zambia. This is a distinctive Nyanja dialect with some features of Nsenga, although the language also incorporates large numbers of English-derived words, as well as showing influence from other Zambian languages such as Bemba. Town Nyanja has no official status, and the presence of large numbers of loanwords and colloquial expressions has given rise to the misconception that it is an unstructured mixture of languages or a form of slang.\n\nThe fact that the standard Nyanja used in schools differs dramatically from the variety actually spoken in Lusaka has been identified as a barrier to the acquisition of literacy among Zambian children.\n\nThe concords in Town Nyanja differ from those in Chichewa described above. For example, classes 5 and 6 both have the concord \"ya-\" instead of \"la-\" and \"a-\"; class 8 has \"va-\" instead of \"za-\"; and 13 has \"twa-\" instead of \"ta-\". In addition, the subject and object marker for \"I\" is \"ni-\" rather than \"ndi-\", and that for \"they\" is \"βa-\" (spelled \"ba-\") rather than \"a-\".\n\n\n"}

He went on to study at the Center for Cognitive Studies, Harvard University in 1963.\n\n\nAs well as being a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi and holding several academic fellowships including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973-1974, McNeill was Gustaf Stern Lecturer at the University of Göteborg, Sweden in 1999; and Vice President of the International Society for Gesture Studies from 2002–2005.\n\nIn 1995, McNeill won the Award for Outstanding Faculty Achievement, University of Chicago; and in 1995 he was awarded the Gordon J. Laing Award from the University of Chicago Press for the book \"Hand and Mind\".\n\nIn 2004, the National-Louis University (a multi-campus institution in Chicago) Office of Institutional Management Grants Center received an American Psychological Association Grant for Gale Stam Psychology College of Arts and Sciences to provide \"a Festschrift conference honoring Professor David McNeill of the University of Chicago.\"\n\nMcNeill specializes in psycholinguistics, and in particular scientific research into the relationship of language to thought, and the gestures that accompany discourse.\n\nIn his research, McNeill has studied videoed discourses of the same stimulus stories being retold \"together with their co-occurring spontaneous gestures\" by \"speakers of different languages, [...] by non-native speakers at different stages of learning English, by children at various ages, by adolescent deaf children not exposed to language models, and by speakers with neurological impairments (aphasic, right hemisphere damaged, and split-brain patients).\"\n\nThis and other research has formed the subject matter of a number of books which McNeill has written through his career.\n\nThe \"growth point\" is a key theoretical concept in McNeill’s approach to psycholinguistics and is central to his work on gestures, specifically those spontaneous and unwitting hand movements that regularly accompany informal speech. The growth point, or GP, posits that gestures and speech are unified and need to be considered jointly. For McNeill, gestures are in effect (or, McNeill would say, in reality) the speaker’s thought in action, and integral components of speech, not merely accompaniments or additions. Much evidence supports this idea, but its full implications have not always been recognized.\n\nMcNeill argues that thought is multimodal: both vocal-linguistic and manual-gestural, and the resulting semiotic opposition fuels change. In terms of semiotics, as a kind of sign, a gesture is \"global\" (in that the meanings of the \"parts\"—the hand shapes, space, direction, articulation–-depend in a top-down fashion on the meaning of the whole) and \"synthetic\" (in that several meanings are bundled into one gesture). Gestures, when they combine, do not form what Ferdinand de Saussure terms syntagmatic values; they paint a more elaborate picture but contain nothing corresponding to the emerging syntagmatic value of a noun as a direct object when combined with a verb (“hit the ball”, where “ball”, by itself, is not a direct object). Speech contrasts on each of these points: it is bottom-up, analytic and combinatoric.\n\nThe synchronization of speech and gesture is the key to this theoretical GP unit. Gestures offer one kind of symbol, language a different kind. These two kinds, when synchronized in a GP, bring semiotically opposite modes of thinking together at the same time. This synchrony of opposites sets in motion a dialectic of imagery and linguistic form that is the \"fuel\" of the dynamic dimension of language in which forms emerge, say their piece, and disappear. The gestures coincide with speech, and the resulting dialectic is a model of this dimension.\n\nIn one example, a speaker describes an episode in a cartoon she has watched: “He goes up thróugh the pipe this time.” (In this example, boldface type indicates where the gesture movements occurred; the accent indicates speech emphasis.) At “up” the hand rises upward; at “thróugh” the fingers spread outward to create an interior space. These movements take place concurrently and in synchrony with “up thróugh”, the linguistic package that carries the same meanings. This creates a joint realization of the idea of upward motion and interiority, with interiority highlighted in both gesture (the flayed-out fingers) and speech (the accented vowel). But the speech divides the event into semantic units: a directed path (“up”), plus the idea of interiority (“through”), which must be combined to obtain the composite meaning of the whole. In the gesture, this composite meaning is fused into one symbol and the semantic units are simultaneous. The synchronized speech and gesture are co-expressive but semiotically non-redundant.\n\nA GP forms a single mental package or idea unit out of these semiotically opposed components. McNeill argues that this semiotic opposition is unstable, and that the processes initiated to resolve it, called \"unpacking\", propel thought and speech forward. This creates a new form of human cognition that animates language and gives it a dynamic dimension.\n\nSpeech and gesture, taken together, comprise minimal units of human linguistic cognition. Following Lev Vygotsky in defining a \"unit\" as the smallest package that retains the quality of being a whole, in this case the whole of a gesture-language unity, McNeill calls the minimal psychological unit a Growth Point because it is meant to be the initial pulse of thinking-for-(and while)-speaking, out of which a dynamic process of organization emerges. The linguistic component of speech categorizes the visual and actional imagery of the gesture; the imagery of the gesture grounds the linguistic categories in a visual spatial frame.\n\nThe GP theory contrasts to \"modular\" theories such as those of Willem Levelt (), which posit a sequence in which thinking precedes and speech follows. A sequence of thinking before speaking has no place in the growth point. In a GP, speech and thought are inseparable, unified, and simultaneous.\n\nMcNeill employs the concept of “material carriers”, a phrase used by Vygotsky to refer to the embodiment of meaning in enactments or material experiences to further develop the concepts of Mead’s Loop and the GP. A material carrier enhances the symbolization’s representational power. The concept implies that the gesture, \"the actual motion of the gesture itself\", is a dimension of meaning. This enhancement is possible if the gesture \"is\" the very image; not an \"expression\" or \"representation\" of it, but \"it\". From this viewpoint, a gesture is an image in its most developed: that is, its most materially, naturally embodied form. The absence of a gesture is the converse, an image in its least material form. The material carrier concept thus helps explain how an imagery-language dialectic can take place in absence of gesture. When no gesture occurs, there is still global-synthetic imagery in a dialectic with linguistic categorization, but we experience it at the \"lowest level of materialization\". It is not an alteration of the dialectic of its essentials-–the simultaneous rendering of meaning in opposite semiotic modes-–but a bleached version of it.\n\nMcNeill furthers this conception of the material carrier by turning to Maurice Merleau-Ponty for insight into the duality of gesture and language. Gesture, the instantaneous, global, nonconventional component, is “not an external accompaniment” of speech, which is the sequential, analytic, combinatoric component; it is not a “representation” of meaning, but instead meaning “inhabits” it. Merleau-Ponty links gesture and existential significance:\n\nThe link between the word and its living meaning is not an external accompaniment to intellectual processes, the meaning inhabits the word, and language ‘is not an external accompaniment to intellectual processes’. We are therefore led to recognize a gestural or existential significance to speech. … Language certainly has inner content, but this is not self-subsistent and self-conscious thought. What then does language express, if it does not express thoughts? It presents or rather it \"is\" the subject’s taking up of a position in the world of his meanings. [emphasis in the original]\nFor McNeill, the GP is a mechanism geared to this “existential significance” of speech, this “taking up a position in the world”. Gesture, as part of the GP, is inhabited by the same “living meaning” that inhabits the word (and beyond, the whole of a discourse). A deeper answer to the query, therefore-–when we see a gesture, what are we seeing?--is that we see part of the speaker’s current cognitive being, \"her very mental existence\", at the moment it occurs. This too is part of the origin of language by Mead's Loop (and explains the gestural leakage of lies. By performing the gesture, a core idea is brought into concrete existence and becomes part of the speaker’s own existence at that moment. A gesture is not a representation, or is not only such: it is a form of being. From a first-person perspective, the gesture is part of the immediate existence of the speaker. Gestures (and words, etc., as well) are themselves thinking in one of its many forms, not only expressions of thought, \"but thought, i.e., cognitive being, itself\". To the speaker, gesture and speech are not only \"messages\" or communications, but are a way of cognitively existing, of cognitively being, at the moment of speaking.\n\nTo make a gesture, from this perspective, is to bring thought into existence on a concrete plane, just as writing out a word can have a similar effect. The greater the felt departure of the thought from the immediate context, the more likely is its materialization in a gesture, because of this contribution to being. Conversely, when \"newsworthiness\" is minimal materialization diminishes and in some cases disappears, even though a GP is active; in these cases gestures may cease while (empty) speech continues, or vice versa, speech ceases and a vague gesture takes place. Thus, gestures are more or less elaborated and GPs more or less materialized depending on the importance of material realization to the \"existence\" of the thought.\n\nIn terms of the origin of language, the GP \"predicts\" (of the remote past) that whatever evolved led to a GP system of semiotic oppositions. This provides an empirical test of all theories on the origin of language: Can the theory in question explain the observed speech-gesture-thought unity of human cognition? The widely popular \"gesture-first\" theory, according to which language began as pure gesture without speech, fails this test. In fact, it fails it twice, predicting what did not evolve (that speech supplanted gesture) and not predicting what did evolve (our own speech-gesture unity). An alternative, which McNeill calls \"Mead's Loop\" after the philosopher George Herbert Mead, explains this unity. It too claims that gesture was essential to the origin of language, but not because it was \"primitive\" or more accessible. Rather, it says that speech could not have evolved without gesture; neither could gesture have evolved without speech. Speech and gesture originated together, at the same time, in response to the same selection pressures.\n\nG. H. Mead said that a gesture is significant when it arouses in the person making it the same response it arouses in others (which explains why gestures occur face-to-face and over the phone but not to a tape recorder). According to Mead's Loop, mirror neurons underwent a \"twist\" whereby they came to respond to one’s own gestures as if they came from someone else: this is what evolved. The \"twist\" works because it brings the significance of one’s own gestures into the same areas of the brain where speech is being orchestrated. Gesture imagery co-opts the orchestration of speech. The result is units of speech and gesture as the GP envisions. Uniquely in the animal kingdom, gestures came to orchestrate movements of the vocal tract, transforming the \"vegetative\" system of eating and breathing into an organ of speaking. According to Mead's Loop, this role of imagery in speech orchestration is a major reason why we gesture as we speak.\n\nMead’s Loop and the mirror neuron \"twist\" would be naturally selected in scenarios where sensing one’s own actions as social is advantageous. For example, in imparting information to infants, where it gives the adult the sense of being an instructor as opposed to being just a doer with an onlooker, as is the case with chimpanzees. Entire cultural practices of childrearing depend upon this sense. Self-awareness as an agent is necessary for this advantage to take hold. For Mead's Loop to have been selected the adult must be sensitive to her own gestures as social actions.\n\nThe link between the GP and self-aware agency also appears in children’s language development, which can be linked to the origin of language in a version of the long-dismissed \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\" hypothesis of recapitulation theory. McNeill considers that when something emerges in current-day ontogenesis only at a certain stage of development, the original natural selection of the feature (if there was any) might have taken place in a similar psychological milieu in phylogenesis. This opens a window onto the mindset of the creature in which the Mead's Loop \"twist\" was evolving. As a mode of reasoning, it exploits the fact that children’s intellectual status is not fixed but changing. Thus, McNeill argues, we look for new states that seem pegged to steps in the ontogenesis of GPs and Mead's Loop underlying them, and consider these steps as possible signals from ancient phylogenesis. Evidence shows that self-aware agency could be such a signal. The GP emerges around age 3 or 4 years, which is also about when children first become aware of themselves as agents, since before that age the speech and gestures of children have “…the character of ‘sharing’ experiences \"with\" the other rather than of ‘communicating’ messages \"to\" the Other”, as put by Heinz Werner and Bernard Kaplan in their 1963 book, \"Symbol Formation\". The theory of mind (which is really awareness of other perspectives) also emerges about this time, and likewise depends on self-aware agency.\n\nMcNeill's books have received coverage in a number of academic journals and in the general press.\n\nA 1991 article in the \"Chicago Reader\"; a 2006 article in the \"Scientific American, Mind\" magazine; and a 2008 article in \"Boston Globe\" describe McNeill's work on the language of gesture in detail.\n\n\"The Acquisition of Language\" was reviewed in the \"International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders\" in 1971.\n\n\"The Conceptual Basis of Language\" was reviewed in \"The Conceptual Basis of Language\" in 1980.\n\n\"Hand and Mind\" was reviewed in \"Language and Speech\"; the \"American Journal of Psychology\"; and \"Language\" in 1994.\n\n\"Gesture and Thought\" was reviewed in \"Language in Society\" and \"Metaphor and Symbol\" in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1930, at the age of nineteen, he became a journalist in Alicante writing in the satirical newspaper \"El Tio Cuc\", in Valencian. During the Second Spanish Republic he started to become politically active. His main demand was for autonomous status for the Land of Valencia. He was also at this time working in the city of Valencia in the nationalist newspapers \"La República de les Lletres\", \"El Camí\" and \"El País Valencià\". When the Spanish Civil War broke out he supported the Spanish Republic.\n\nAfter the war, he cut back on his political activities to concentrate on literature. At the beginning of the 1950s he started to compile \"rondalles\", a type of folk narrative, which were published as \"Rondalles valencianes\" (1950–1958). During the 1960s he returned to underground political activities involving Valencian nationalism and, as a result, he became a political prisoner of Francisco Franco's Spanish State from 1966 to 1968. Once out of prison he founded almost the first magazine in Valencian in the postwar period; \"Gorg\" (\"Whirl\", in Valencian). When the Francoist State ended, Enric Valor was able to spread freely his opinions and literary works. He became honoured with many important literary and linguistic awards from all over the \"Països Catalans\". During the 1990s there was a move among some Valencian cultural groups to propose Valor as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but it didn't come to fruit.\n\nValor then died in 2000.\n\nHis first linguistic work was in the weekly magazine \"El Tio Cuc\" based in Alicante. He was contributing to the development of the Catalan-Valencian-Balearic Dictionary (such a Catalan inter-dialectal dictionary) under the directorship of Francesc de Borja i Moll, which included a Southern Valencian lexicon. Like Carles Salvador and Sanchis Guarner, he was one of the principal promoters of the standardisation of Valencian by means of works such as \"Curs de la llengua valenciana\" (\"Gorg\", 1961), \"Millorem el llenguatge\" (1971), and \"Curso medio de gramática catalana referida especialmente al País Valenciano\" (1973).\n\nIn 1983 he released \"La flexió verbal\" where he summarized the widely dialectised Valencian verbs. This work became the principal reference for the normative use of verbs, and is used as essential teaching material for Valencian pupils.\n\nHis most known work is \"Rondalles valencianes\" (1950–1958), where 36 valencian popular tales are collected as a literary narration. Other works with a similar style are \"Narracions de la Foia de Castalla\" (1953), and \"Meravelles i picardies\" (1964–1970).\n\nValor was also a writer. His first novel was \"L'ambició d'Aleix\" which was started between the 1940s and 1950s, but it was being re-written until its release in 1960. Perhaps his most important novel work is \"Cicle de Cassana\" which is made up of three novels: \"Sense la terra promesa\" (1960), \"Temps de batuda\" (1983), and \"Enllà de l'horitzó\" (1991). The \"Cicle de Cassana\" trilogy aims for the regaining of collective memory between 1916 and 1939. In 1982 he published \"La idea de l'emigrant\".\n\n\n"}

Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work \"Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family\", the Eskimo system was one of six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese).\n\nThe joint family system places no distinction between patrilineal and matrilineal relatives, instead, it focuses on differences in kinship distance (the closer the relative is, the more distinctions are made). The system emphasizes the nuclear family, identifying directly only the mother, father, brother, and sister. All other relatives are grouped together into categories. It uses both classificatory and descriptive terms, differentiating between gender, generation, lineal relatives (relatives in the direct line of descent), and collateral relatives (blood relatives not in the direct line of descent). The Eskimo system is defined by its \"cognatic\" or \"bilateral\" emphasis - no distinction is made between patrilineal and matrilineal relatives.\n\nParental siblings are distinguished only by their sex (Aunt, Uncle). All children of these individuals are lumped together regardless of sex (Cousins). Unlike the Hawaiian system, Ego's parents are clearly distinguished from their siblings.\nThe Eskimo system is relatively common among the world's kinship systems, at about 10% of the world's societies. It is now common in most Western societies (such as those of Europe or Americas). In addition, it is found among a small number of food-foraging peoples such as the !Kung tribe of Africa and the Eskimos/Inuit for whom it is named.\n\nThe system is widely used in non-unilineal societies, where the dominant relatives are the immediate family. In most Western societies, the nuclear family represents an independent social and economic group, which has caused the emphasis on the immediate kinship. The tendency of families in Western societies to live apart also reinforces this.\n\nThe term \"Eskimo\" is considered pejorative in Canada, and has been replaced there by the term \"Inuit\". The former remains in use in Alaska, though less so than in past decades. In Canada, the term \"Inuit kinship\" is therefore widely used instead of \"Eskimo kinship\".\n\n\n"}

The act of throwing the bales up to a higher level is called \"bucking\". The work is very strenuous and physically demanding, and is dependent upon using a proper technique in order to not become fatigued and avoid injury. \n\nLarge quantities of small square bales are sometimes gathered with mechanical equipment such as a hay stacker, which can hold up to about 100 hay bales.\n\nThe workers generally wear chaps to protect their legs and use hay hooks, long metal hooks with wooden handles, to secure the bales and move them. An apparatus known as an elevator is used to move the bales, conveyor belt style, to levels too high to buck them. Workers are usually paid by the ton or by the number of bales. Because the work is so labor-intensive, many farmers have taken to making multiple ton bales that are moved with machines.\n\nHay bucking competitions are sometimes held at rodeos and county fairs.\n"}

Its aim is the promotion of the art of calligraphy and its educational significance through exhibitions and festivals.\n\nCalligraphy is the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner (Mediavilla 1996: 18).\n\nIn 2008 Alexey Shaburov, the President of Sokolniki Exhibition and Convention Centre initiated the project with renowned calligraphers and designers, namely Pyotr Chobitko, Evgeny Dobrovinsky, professors Leonid Pronenko, Pavel Semchenko, one of the founders of the Soviet calligraphy school Ilya Bogdesko, and Nikolay Taranov to join it within a few months.\n\nOver the years of the project’s existence, it has featured works by renowned calligraphers from the following countries:\n\nAustralia, Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, Great Britain, Hungaria, Germany, Hong Kong, Greece, Georgia, Israel, India, Jordan, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Palestina, Peru, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Siria, Slovenia, USA, Taiwan, Tunisia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Finland, France, Montenegro, Czech Republic, Ethiopia, UAE, South Africa.\n\n\nRepin State Academic Institute of Painting Sculpture and Architecture hosted the I International Exhibition of Calligraphy on September 16–21, 2008. On the first day, more than 500 people visited it even before the official opening.480 works from 25 states were presented. In total, over 700 works were submitted for the exhibition.\n\nMore than 20 lectures and workshops from Russian and foreign artists were held during the five days of the Exhibition. The exhibition boasted with the presence of 40 renowned international calligraphers.\n\n\"Interesting facts\"\n\nThe welcome book was to be posted an entry in with ink and quill.\n\nAll female visitors on the last day of the Exhibition were presented with white roses.\n\nVisitors of the event included a just-married couple and a group of cadets.\n\n\nDecember 9–14, 2008 the Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy held the special exhibit ‘Mysteries of the world calligraphy’ dedicated to the Constitution Day. A formal trigger to launch this exhibit was the arrival of a new item: the Handwritten Constitution of the Russian Federation, first of its kind in the Post-Soviet Russia. This A2-sized work has been performed in five months by Pyotr Chobitko, Chairman of the National Union of Calligraphers, in person (with the exception of lining the sheets).\n\nThe exhibition featured several workshops and lectures by Russian and international artists.\n\n\nDates: October 14 - November 14, 2009.\n\nVenue: Sokolniki Exhibition and Convention Centre.\n\nTotal exhibition area: 5,000 sq.m.\n\nThis exhibition became a benchmark event in the project’s history, and here’s why:\nThe event featured 72 workshops offered by the leading calligraphy masters of the world, among them\nUnique pieces premiered at the exhibition:\nThe framework of the exhibition also featured the \"From the Earth to the Universe\" project, representing a collection of unique photographs of the vast depths of space.\n\n\nThe III International Exhibition of Calligraphy was successfully held September 10–12, 2010 in Veliky Novgorod. A special-built mobile pavilion erected in the city historic centre near the Kremlin in Yaroslav’s Court became its venue. The project’s unique feature is that the event was the first ever large-scale travelling exhibition of a current ICOM member.The Exhibition received RUEF (Russian Union of exhibitions and fairs) approval for high professional level of exhibitions organization.\n\n— Over 37000 visitors attended the event over the three days\n\n— 19 trucks with equipment and exhibits travelled from Moscow to Novgorod to make it happen\n\n— They carried 136 tons of cargo\n\n— A team of 91 from the Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy and the MVK International Exhibition Company came from Moscow to prepare the exhibition.\n\nOver the four days of the event, 46 workshops were held. In total, 35 renowned calligraphy artists took part in the exhibition. Novgorod residents had a chance to see over 300 calligraphy exhibits, including some listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nFor the first time a wakeboarding tournament for WakeWorld Russia Cup took place within the Exhibition, with best professional riders from Russia, Europe and Asia. The Museum Night project was also held in cooperation with the Novgorod State United Museum-Reserve.\n\n\nDate — November 1 – December 15, 2012. Venue — the Contemporary museum of calligraphy.\n\n10 new authors from European and Eastern countries with their distinct styles and personalities took part in the 4th International Exhibition of Calligraphy. Valerian Bakharev’s “I Ching Signs” consisting of 64 hexagrammic paintings became the symbol of the exposition.\n\nThe unique feature of this exhibition was the fact that the exposition changed 6 times. The program included lectures and workshops for both adults and children.\n\n\nV International Exhibition of Calligraphy was held in Moscow March 14 through April 12, 2015. The anniversary event boasted with the participation of a recorв number of participants: 90 artists from 52 countries who presented 201 calligraphy artworks. The theme of the exposition was ‘Reflections on the Motherland’. \nOne of the unique pieces presented at the exhibition was the handwritten Gospel of Mark created by the Russian artist Apollinariya Mishina. The book contains a series of illustrations on 155 pages, 104 of which are miniatures made in colour etching technique and illuminated with leaf gold. This piece was highly praised by the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe VI International Exhibition of Calligraphy is scheduled to be held in a purpose-built pavilion on Festivalnaya square of Sokolniki Park from September 1 through 10, 2017.\n\nParticipants will present diverse callifraphy works on the theme ‘For Life’.\n\nThe event programme is to include lectures, presentations and workshops from Russian and international artists.\n\nOn May 14, 2008 the National Union of Calligraphers was established at the International Exhibition of Calligraphy. The handwritten charter with many famous Russian calligraphers’ signatures testifies to the Union’s birth. Under the Charter the Union aims at revival of the art of calligraphy in Russia, creating conditions for its development and admitting everybody who is willing to learn the beauty of writing. Petr Chobitko was elected Chairman of the Union with Alexey Shaburov as its President.\n\nThe most outstanding Union’s masterpiece is the Handwritten Constitution of the Russian Federation performed by Pyotr Chobitko in person. It is stored at Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy. Miniature copies of the piece have been prepared as gift editions.\n\n\n"}

He received a Sahitya Akademi Award for Gujarati in 1989 for his novel \"Angaliyat\" (1986). He was also a recipient of the Dhanji Kanji Gandhi Suvarna Chandrak award in 1990. His significant works include: \"Vyathana Vitak\" (Agony of Suffering; 1985), \"Angaliyat\" (The Step Child; 1986) and \"Mari Paranetar\" (1988). He died on 28 March 2010, in Nadiad following kidney failure.\n\nMacwan's grandfather was a Hindu, but he adopted Christianity in 1892. Macwan was born on 9 October 1936 in Tranol, a small village of Kheda taluka, Anand district, Gujarat. His family were natives of Oad, a small village nearby. He was born in Tranol because his father Ignas Dahyalal was working with a Christian mission there. His father was also known as a master in his village. His childhood passed in poverty and lack of maternal care. His mother Hiriben Hira died when he was young. His father soon married another woman who was cruel to him.\n\nMacwan was a prodigy. He was admitted to school when he was five years old because his reading and writing skills were more advanced than those of most students of the usual admitting age of seven years. At that time it was unusual to study in school in his community. He had good memory skills and he could remember poems by listening to his brother who used to recite poems to his ill mother. He studied in the Missionary School of Oad village until fourth grade, then he did two grades at a local board school. He passed the vernacular final exam at the I P Mission School of Nadiad in 1950.\n\nDue to poverty, he joined the Christian Missionary School at Khamloj as a teacher when he was fourteen. Later he was transferred to Missionary School, Nadiad as a Deputy PTC in 1955. In the same year, he passed matriculation with 72%. He then joined Primary Teacher's College (PTC) which he passed with 72%. He also completed \"Vinit Visharad\" and \"Rashtrabhasha Ratna\" during the same period. In 1957, he joined St. Xavier's School in Anand as a teacher of Hindi language. He passed a Master of Arts in Hindi by studying in weekend classes while working as a teacher. He served as a visiting lecturer of Hindi at the College of Dakor from 1971 to 1972 and at M B College, Vidyanagar from 1972 to 1977. Later he resigned from his visiting lecturer posts and continued to teach at the St. Xavier's School until his retirement in 1994.\n\nHe married Reginaben in November 1955, and they had four daughters and four sons.\n\nHe died on 28 March 2010, in Nadiad following kidney failure.\n\nMacwan's writing is inspired by his real life experiences.\n\nHis first novel \"Angaliyat\" (The Stepchild) was published in 1986, followed by \"Lakshman Ni Agni Pariksha\" (1986), \"Mari Parnetar\" (1988), \"Manakhani Mirat\" (1992), \"Bij-Trij Na Tej\" (1995), \"Ajanma Aparadhi\" (1995), \"Dada Na Deshma\" (1996), \"Mavatar\" (1996), \"Amar Chandalo\" (2002), \"Dariya\" (2006), \"Sangavato\", \"Bhini Mati Kora Man\" (2004), \"Apano Paras Aap\" (2005) and \"Charushila\" (2011). Macwan depicted the life of the Charotar region in his novels. \"Vyathana Vitak\", is a biographical work published in 1985, followed by \"Vahalna Valkha\" (1987), \"Prit Pramani Pagle Pagle\" (1987) and \"Mari Bhillu\" (1989). \"Sadhna Ni Aaradhna\" (1989) is a short story collection.\n\nHis novel \"Angaliyat\" has been translated into English by Rita Kothari as \"The Stepchild\" in 2004. His \"Lohino Sambandh\" has been adapted as the film \"Bas Yari Rakho\" (English title: \"My Little Devil\") and \"Baheru Aayakhu Mungi Vyatha\" has been adapted as a tele-film.\n\nHe won Sahitya Akademi Award for Gujarati language in 1989 for his novel \"Angaliyat\". He won Dhanji Kanji Gandhi Suvarna Chandrak in 1990.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "626817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=626817", "title": "Languages of the Philippines", "text": "Languages of the Philippines\n\nThere are some 120 to 187 languages and dialects in the Philippines, depending on the method of classification. Almost all are Malayo-Polynesian languages. A number of Spanish-influenced creole varieties generally called Chavacano are also spoken in certain communities. The 1987 constitution designates Filipino as the national language and an official language along with English.\n\nWhile Filipino is used for communication across the country's diverse linguistic groups and is used in popular culture, the government operates mostly using English. Including second-language speakers, there are more speakers of Filipino than English in the Philippines. The other regional languages are given official auxiliary status in their respective places according to the constitution but does not specify any language in particular. Some of these regional languages are also used in education.\n\nThe indigenous scripts of the Philippines (such as the Kulitan, Tagbanwa and others) are used very little; instead, Filipino languages are today written in the Latin script because of the Spanish and American colonial experience. Baybayin, though generally not understood, is one of the most well-known of the indigenous Filipino scripts and is used mainly in artistic applications such as on the Philippine banknotes, where the word \"Pilipino\" is inscribed using the writing system. Additionally, the Arabic script is used in the Muslim areas in the southern Philippines.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution declares Filipino as the national language of the country. Filipino and English are the official languages, with the recognition of the regional languages as auxiliary official in their respective regions (though not specifying any particular languages). Spanish and Arabic are to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis.\n\nSpanish was the official language of the country for more than three centuries under Spanish colonial rule, and became the lingua franca of the Philippines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced universal education, creating free public schooling in Spanish. It was also the language of the Philippine Revolution, and the 1899 Malolos Constitution effectively proclaimed it as the official language of the First Philippine Republic. National hero José Rizal wrote most of his works in Spanish. Luciano de la Rosa established that Spanish was spoken by a total of 60% of the population in the early 20th century as a first, second or third language. Following the American occupation of the Philippines and the imposition of English, the use of Spanish declined gradually, especially after the 1940s.\n\nUnder the U.S. occupation and civil regime, English began to be taught in schools. By 1901, public education used English as the medium of instruction. Around 600 educators (called \"Thomasites\") who arrived in that year aboard the USAT \"Thomas\" replaced the soldiers who also functioned as teachers. The 1935 Constitution added English as an official language alongside Spanish. A provision in this constitution also called for Congress to \"take steps toward the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages.\" On November 12, 1937, the First National Assembly created the National Language Institute. President Manuel L. Quezón appointed native Waray speaker Jaime C. De Veyra to chair a committee of speakers of other regional languages. Their aim was to select a national language among the other regional languages. Ultimately, Tagalog was chosen as the base language December 30, 1937, on the basis that it was the most widely spoken and developed local language.\n\nIn 1939, President Manuel L. Quezón renamed the Tagalog language as \"Wikang Pambansa\" (\"national language\" in English translation). The language was further renamed in 1959 as \"Pilipino\" by Secretary of\nEducation Jose Romero. The 1973 constitution declared the Pilipino language to be co-official, along with English, and mandated the development of a national language, to be known as \"Filipino\". In addition, Spanish regained its official status when President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155, s. 1973.\n\nThe present constitution, ratified in 1987, designates Filipino and English as joint official languages. Filipino also had the distinction of being a national language that was to be \"developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages.\" Although not explicitly stated in the constitution, Filipino is in practice almost completely composed of the Tagalog language as spoken in the capital, Manila; however, organizations such as the University of the Philippines began publishing dictionaries such as the \"UP Diksyonaryong Filipino\" in which words from various Philippine languages were also included. The present constitution is also the first to give recognition to other regional languages. The constitution also made mention of Spanish and Arabic, both of which are to be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.\n\nFilipino is an official language of education and also the major language of the broadcast media and cinema, but less important than English as a language of publication (except in some domains, like comic books) and less important for academic-scientific-technological discourse. Filipino is used as a lingua franca in all regions of the Philippines as well as within overseas Filipino communities, and is the dominant language of the armed forces (except perhaps for the small part of the commissioned officer corps from wealthy or upper-middle-class families) and of a large part of the civil service, most of whom are non-Tagalogs.\n\nThere are different forms of diglossia that exist in the case of regional languages. Locals may use their mother tongue or the regional lingua franca to communicate amongst themselves, but sometimes switch to foreign languages when addressing outsiders. Another is the prevalence of code-switching to English when speaking in both their first language and Tagalog.\n\nThe Constitution of the Philippines provides for the use of the vernacular languages as official auxiliary languages in provinces where Filipino is not the lingua franca. Filipinos at large are polyglots; In the case where the vernacular language is a regional language, Filipinos would speak in Filipino when speaking in formal situations while the regional languages are spoken in non-formal settings. This is evident in major urban areas outside Metro Manila like Camarines Norte in the Bikol-speaking area, and Davao in the Cebuano-speaking area. , the case of Ilocano and Cebuano are becoming more of bilingualism than diglossia due to the publication of materials written in these languages.\n\nThe diglossia is more evident in the case of other languages such as Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Bikol, Waray, Hiligaynon, Sambal, and Maranao, where the written variant of the language is becoming less and less popular to give way to the use of Filipino. Although Philippine laws consider some of these languages as \"major languages\" there is little, if any, support coming from the government to preserve these languages. This may be bound to change, however, given current policy trends.\n\nThere still exists another type of diglossia, which is between the regional languages and the minority languages. Here, we label the regional languages as acrolects while the minority languages as the basilect. In this case, the minority language is spoken only in very intimate circles, like the family or the tribe one belongs to. Outside this circle, one would speak in the prevalent regional language, while maintaining an adequate command of Filipino for formal situations. Unlike the case of the regional languages, these minority languages are always in danger of becoming extinct because of speakers favoring the more prevalent regional language. Moreover, most of the users of these languages are illiterate and as expected, there is a chance that these languages will no longer be revived due to lack of written records.\n\nAside from the two official nationwide languages used in the Philippines, namely, Filipino and English, other languages have been proposed as additional nationwide languages. Among the most prominent proposals are Japanese, and Spanish.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, a total of 182 native languages are spoken in the nation and four languages have been classified as extinct: Dicamay Agta, Katabaga, Tayabas Ayta and Villaviciosa Agta. Except for English, Spanish, Chavacano and varieties of Chinese (Hokkien, Cantonese and Mandarin), all of the languages belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family.\n\nThere are 12 indigenous languages with at least one million native speakers:\n\n\nOne or more of these is spoken natively by more than 90% of the population.\n\nA Philippine language sub-family identified by Robert Blust includes languages of north Sulawesi and the Yami language of Taiwan, but excludes the Sama–Bajaw languages of the Tawi-Tawi islands, as well as a couple of North Bornean languages spoken in southern Palawan.\n\nEskayan is an artificial auxiliary language created as the embodiment of a Bohol nation in the aftermath of the Philippine–American War. It is used by about 500 people.\n\nPhilippine languages are often referred to by Filipinos as dialects, partly as a relic of the inaccurate vocabulary used in literature during the American period (1898–1946). While there are indeed many hundreds of dialects in the Philippines, they represent variations of no fewer than 120 distinct languages, and many of these languages maintain greater differences than those between established European languages like French and Spanish.\n\nThe vast differences between the languages can be seen in the following translations of what has been asserted to be the Philippine national proverb:\n\nThe amount of dialectal variation varies from language to language. Languages like Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinan are known to have very moderate dialectal variation.\n\nThe languages of the Bicol Region, however, there is great dialectal variation. There are cities and towns which have their own dialects and varieties. Below is the sentence \"Were you there at the market for a long time?\" translated into certain varieties of Bikol. The translation is followed by dialect and corresponding language, and a city/town in Bicol where they are spoken. The final translation is in Tagalog.\n\n\nBelow is a chart of Philippine languages. While there have been misunderstandings on which ones should be classified as \"language\" and which ones should be classified as \"dialect\", the chart confirms that most have similarities, yet are not mutually comprehensible. These languages are arranged according to the regions they are natively spoken (from north to south, then east to west).\n\nThere is a language spoken by the Tao people (also known as Yami) of Orchid Island of Taiwan which is not included in the language of the Philippines. Their language, Tao (or Yami) is part of the Batanic languages which includes Ivatan, Babuyan, and Itbayat of the \"Batanes\".\n\nBelow are population estimates from the 2000 Philippine census by the Philippine Statistics Authority on the number of Filipinos who speak the following 18 languages as a native language.\n\nEndangered and extinct languages in the Philippines are based on the 3rd world volume released by UNESCO in 2010.\n\nDegree of endangerment (UNESCO standard)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a separate study by Thomas N. Headland, the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas, and the University of North Dakota called \"Thirty Endangered Languages in the Philippines\", the Philippines has 32 endangered languages, but 2 of the listed languages in the study are written with 0 speakers, noting that they are extinct or probably extinct. All of the listed languages are Negrito languages, the oldest languages in the Philippines.\n\nThere have been numerous proposals to conserve the many languages of the Philippines. According to the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino, there are 135 ethno-linguistic groups in the country, each having their own distinct Philippine language.\n\nAmong the proposals include (1) \"establishing a dictionary & sentence construction manual\" for each of the 135 living languages in the country, (2) \"video documentation\" of all Philippine languages, (3) \"revival of the ancient scripts of the Philippines\" where each ethnic group's own script shall be revived and used in schools along with the currently-used Roman script in communities where those script/s used to be known, (4) \"teaching of ethnic mother languages first\" in homes and schools before the teaching of Filipino and foreign languages (English or Arabic), and (5) \"using the ethnic mother language and script first in public signs\" followed by Filipino and foreign languages (English and/or Arabic) and scripts, for example, using Sebwano first followed by Filipino and English underneath the sign.\n\nCurrently, only the fourth proposal has been made by the national government of the Philippines. A National Script bill has been filed in Congress in support of the third and fifth proposal, however, the bill only mandates the usage of the ancient script compatible with the national language, which is Filipino.\nArabic is used by some Filipino Muslims in both a liturgical and instructional capacity since the arrival of Islam and establishment of several Sultanates in the 14th century. Along with Malay, Arabic was the \"lingua franca\" of the Malay Archipelago among Muslim traders and the Malay aristocracy.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution mandates that Arabic (along with Spanish) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis. Arabic is taught for free and is promoted in some Islamic centres predominantly in the southernmost parts of Philippines. It is used primarily in religious activities and education (such as in a \"madrasa\" or Islamic school) and rarely for official events or daily conversation. In this respect, its function and use is somewhat like the traditional roles of Latin and Spanish in Filipino Catholicism \"vis-à-vis\" other currently spoken languages.\n\nThe first significant exposure of Filipinos to the English language occurred in 1762 when the British invaded Manila, but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946, and remains an official language of the Philippines.\n\nEnglish is used in official documents of business, government, the legal system, medicine, the sciences and as a medium of instruction. Filipinos prefer textbooks for subjects like calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, etc., written in English rather than Filipino. However, the topics are usually taught, even in colleges, in Tagalog or the local language. By way of contrast, native languages are often heard in colloquial and domestic settings, spoken mostly with family and friends. The use of English attempts to give an air of formality, given its use in school, government and various ceremonies. A percentage of the media such as cable television and newspapers are also in English; major television networks such as ABS-CBN and GMA and all AM radio stations broadcast primarily in Filipino. However, a 2009 article by a UNICEF worker reported that the level of spoken English language in the Philippines was poor. The article reported that aspiring Filipino teachers score the lowest in English out of all of the subjects on their licensing exams.\n\nA large influx of English (American English) words has been assimilated into Tagalog and the other native languages called Taglish or Bislish. There is a debate, however, on whether there is diglossia or bilingualism, between Filipino and English. Filipino is also used both in formal and informal situations. Though the masses would prefer to speak in Filipino, government officials tend to speak in English when performing government functions. There is still resistance to the use of Filipino in courts and the drafting of national statutes.\n\nOn August 22, 2007, three Malolos City regional trial courts in Bulacan decided to use Filipino, instead of English, in order to promote the national language. Twelve stenographers from Branches 6, 80 and 81, as model courts, had undergone training at Marcelo H. del Pilar College of Law of Bulacan State University College of Law following a directive from the Supreme Court of the Philippines. De la Rama said it was the dream of former Chief Justice Reynato Puno to implement the program in other areas such as Laguna, Cavite, Quezón, Nueva Écija, Batangas, Rizal, and Metro Manila.\n\nDiplomatic ties with the Ming dynasty among some established states or kingdoms in Luzon and direct interactions and trade overall within the archipelago as a whole may go as far back as the early 10th century. Mandarin Chinese is the medium of instruction in Chinese schools and the lingua franca of mainland and overseas Chinese. However, the Lan-nang variant of Hokkien Chinese is the majority language the Chinese in the Philippines, who immigrated from the Fujian (pronounced locally as Fukkien or Hokkien) province in China. Other varieties of Chinese such as Hakka and Yue Chinese (especially Cantonese) are spoken among a few Chinese in the Philippines whose ancestral roots trace all the way back from the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in Southern China.\n\nAs with Spanish, many native languages have co-opted numerous loanwords from Chinese, in particular words that refer to cuisine, household objects, and Philippine kinship terminology.\n\nThe Japanese first came to the Philippines around the 11th century CE, the first country they emigrated to, as well as in waves from the 15th century, 17th century, late 19th century, 1900s, 1930s, and the 1940s. There is a small Japanese community and a school for Japanese in Metro Manila due to the number of Japanese companies. Also there is a large community of Japanese and Japanese descendants in Laguna province, Baguio City, and in the Davao Region. Davao City is a home to a large population of Japanese descendants. Japanese laborers were hired by American companies like the National Fiber Company (NAFCO) in the first decades of the 20th century to work in abaca plantations. Japanese were known for their hard work and industry. During World War II, Japanese schools were present in Davao City.\n\nMalay is spoken as a lingua franca in the southernmost parts of the Philippines, from Zamboanga down to Tawi-Tawi among a minority of the Tausug, Sama-Bajau, and Yakan peoples. It is also spoken as a daily language by the Malaysians and Indonesians who have settled, or do business in the Philippines. It is also spoken in southern Palawan to some extent. It is not spoken among the Maranao and Maguindanao peoples. Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and the southern Philippines are largely Islamic and the liturgical language of Islam is Arabic, but the vast majority of Muslims in the Philippines have little practical knowledge of Arabic beyond limited religious terminology.\n\nAncient Malaysian and Indonesian cultures and civilizations in ancient Malaya, Sumatra and Java influenced the history, lifestyles, and culture of the Filipino peoples. The Malay language, along with Philippine languages belonging to the Malayo-Polynesian language family, has also had an immense influence on many languages spoken in the Philippines. This is because Old Malay used to be the lingua franca throughout the archipelago, a good example of this is Magellan's translator Enrique using Malay to converse with the native \"Sugbuanon\" (Cebuano) during this time period.\n\nAn example of Old Malay and Javanese languages spoken in Philippine history can be seen in the language of the 10th century Laguna Copperplate Inscription.\n\nWhen the Spanish had first arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, Old Malay was spoken among the aristocracy.\n\nIt is believed that Ferdinand Magellan’s Moluccan slave Enrique could converse with the local leaders in Cebu Island, confirming to Magellan his arrival in Southeast Asia.\n\nToday, Indonesian is taught as a foreign language in the Department of Linguistics and Asian Languages in the University of the Philippines. Also, the Indonesian School in Davao City teaches the language to preserve the culture of Indonesian immigrants there. The Indonesian Embassy in Manila also offers occasional classes for Filipinos and foreigners.\n\nSince 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language training to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n\nIn an interview, Department of Education Secretary Armin Luistro said that the country's government should promote Indonesian and Malaysian, which are both related to Filipino and other Philippine languages. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.\n\nSince pre-Spanish times, there have been small Indian communities in the Philippines. Indians tend to be able to speak Tagalog and the other native languages, and are often fluent in English. Among themselves, Sindhi and Punjabi are used. Urdu is spoken among the Pakistani community. Only few South Asians, such as Pakistani, as well as the recent newcomers like speakers of Tamil, Nepali and Marathi retain their own respective languages.\n\nSpanish was introduced in the islands after 1565, when the Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi set sail from Mexico and founded the first Spanish settlement on Cebú. Though its usage is not as widespread as before, Spanish has had a significant influence in the various local Philippine languages such as providing numerous loan words. Several Spanish-based creole language varieties collectively known as Chabacano have also emerged. The current 1987 constitution makes mention of Spanish in which it provides that Spanish (along with Arabic) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis.\n\nIn 1593, the first printing press in the Philippine islands was founded and it released the first (albeit polyglot) book, the \"Doctrina Christiana\" that same year. In the 17th century, Spanish religious orders founded the first universities in the Philippines, some of which are considered the oldest in Asia. During colonial rule through Mexico, Spanish was the language of education, trade, politics, and religion, and by the 19th century, became the colony's lingua franca although it was mainly used by the educated Filipinos. In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced a system of public education, creating free public schooling in Spanish. In the 1890s, the Philippines had a prominent group of Spanish-speaking scholars called the Ilustrados, such as José Rizal. Some of these scholars participated in the Philippine Revolution and later in the struggle against American occupation. Both the Malolos Constitution and the \"Lupang Hinirang\" (national anthem) were written in Spanish.\n\nUnder U.S. rule, the English language began to be promoted instead of Spanish. The use of Spanish began to decline as a result of the introduction of English into the public schools as a language of instruction. The 1935 constitution establishing the Philippine Commonwelath designated both English and Spanish as official languages. The 1950 census stated that Filipinos who spoke Spanish as a first or second language made up only 6% of the population. In 1990, the census reported that the number had dwindled to just 2,500. A 2012 survey estimates that while around 1 million people can speak Spanish with varying degrees of competency, only around 439,000 people can speak the language at a native level.\n\nSpanish briefly lost its status as an official language upon promulgation of the 1973 constitution but regained official status two months later when President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155. In the 1987 constitution, Spanish is designated as an \"optional and voluntary language\" but does not mention it as an \"official language\". Spanish was dropped as a college requirement during Corazón Aquino's administration. Former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a third-language Spanish speaker, introduced legislation to re-establish the instruction of Spanish in 2009 in the state education system. Today, the language is still spoken by Filipino-Spanish mestizos and Spanish families who are mainly concentrated in Metro Manila, Iloilo and Cebu. It remains an optional subject in some academic institutions, such as the University of Santo Tomás in Manila and the University of San Carlos in Cebu. \n\nMany historical documents, land titles, and works of literature are written in Spanish and are still not translated into Filipino languages, despite the fact that some such as land titles have legal value. Spanish, through colonization has contributed the largest number of loanwords and expressions in Tagalog, Cebuano, and other Philippine languages. The \"Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española\" (Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language), established in 1924, is a founding member of the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language; an association of the various Spanish academies of the world which cooperate in the standardizing and promotion of the Spanish language. Among its past and present academics are former President Arroyo, former Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo, and Archbishop of Cebú Cardinal Ricardo Vidal.\n\nThere are several Spanish-based creole languages in the Philippines, collectively called Chavacano. These may be split into two major geographical groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Chandu Menon) (1847–1899) was a Malayalam language novelist from Kerala state, India. He is the author of \"Indulekha\", the first major novel in Malayalam published in 1889.\n\nChandu Menon was born on 9 January 1847 in Oyyarath house near Naduvannur in the present day Kozhikode District. His family moved to Thalassery when he was an infant.\n\nChandu Menon got his first lessons from Koran Gurukkal, one of his neighbors. He learnt Sanskrit poetry, drama and grammar from Pandit Kunjanbu Nambiar. About the same time, he received English lessons from a local school and later from K. Kunjan Menon. He had higher school education in the Basel Evangelical Mission Parsi High School in Thalassery. While studying there he is reported to have qualified for the uncovenanted Civil Service by securing a high rank in the test for that Service. In 1864 his mother died when he was in the matriculation class and he was forced to abandon studies.\n\nChandu Menon got married to Lakshmikutty Amma in 1872. The couple had six children.\n\nChandu Menon started his career as a clerk in the government service. William Logan, author of the Malabar Manual appointed him as a clerk at Sub-Collector's office. After working in various offices in Malabar, he slowly rose to the position of a \"Munsiff\", and in 1892 became the sub-judge of Calicut.As per a record available ,he was also District judge of Mangalore in 1895.\n\nChandu Menon was also a social reformer. He was a member of the committee constituted to inquire on Marumakkathayam and report on the Malabar Marriages Bill. His observations on matrimony among Nairs and polyandrous matrimony of Nair women that prevailed during the time are of historical importance. He was given the title of Rao Bahadur in 1898 for excellent service.\nChandu Menon died on 7 September 1899 at his \"Oyyarath\" residence in Thalassery due to cardiac failure.\n\nHe was inspired by his wife to write his first novel \"Indulekha\". He attempted to fashion the work after the English novels popular during those days and depicted the love and lives life of an upper caste woman and her sad destiny. The novel attempted to discuss the topics of feudalism, polygamy and caste oppression.\n\nHis 1889 work, \"Indulekha\", was the first Malayalam fictional work which met with all the requisite characteristics of a novel according to widely accepted Malayalam literary convention. It is not the first novel per se, as \"Kundalatha\" (a much inferior work) by Appu Nedungadi pre-dates it by a year. \"Indulekha\" throws light on the Nair community during the second half of the nineteenth century when it was undergoing a transformation following western influences and English education. It exalts education and satirizes the orthodox practices of temporary marital alliances between Nair women and Namboodiri men. \"Indulekha\" was translated into English 1891 by the-then Collector of Malabar district. Indulekha is claimed to be the only Malayalam novel to be reprinted every year for over hundred years.\n\nHe began a second novel named \"Sarada\", the first part of which appeared in 1892. This novel was meant to be in two parts. However, he was unable to complete the sequel, which never got published.\n\nTwo English speeches made by Chandu Menon, one on \"Administration of Justice in Ancient Times\" and another under the auspices of the Sir T.Muthuswamy Iyer Memorial Committee have been published in book form.\n\n\n"}

Ragnar trained at Dramatens elevskola (The Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school) in 1962-65. The following year he got a job as director's assistant to Ingmar Bergman (on his stage production of Peter Weiss' play \"The Investigation\"), where Ragnar states he learned a lot on the art of acting and directing from \"the master\", just by watching and listening when Bergman worked with his actors and the script. In 1968 Per Ragnar had his breakthrough as an actor, earning much critical acclaim and audience praise for his performances in the Arnold Wesker \"trilogy\" staged that year in Sweden: \"Hönssoppa med korngryn (Chicken Soup with Barley)\", \"Rötter (Roots)\" and \"Jag talar om Jerusalem (I'm talking about Jerusalem)\". The same year he also made his film-breakthrough with \"Korridoren (The Corridor)\", Jan Haldoff's social commenting film on hospitals and the health care system in Sweden, where Ragnar plays a young doctor, new on the job, facing the dilemmas of prioritizing patients.\n\nIn the 1970s his collaborating with TV director Bengt Lagerkvist led to notable performances on TV, first as Arvid Falk in Lagerkvist's TV adaption of Strindberg's play \"The Red Room)\" (\"Röda rummet\"), and in the popular Swedish TV-series \"Någonstans i Sverige (~Somewhere In Sweden)\", a series covering the years in Sweden during the time of World War II in Europe, where Ragnar played the character of fänrik Ancker.\n\nFor a young audience today, in Sweden, he became unforgettable when playing the religious psycho Sten Frisk in the popular and long-running 1990s TV series \"Tre Kronor\" (1994) on Swedish channel TV4, a role that followed him for long and for more than a decade led to him often being typecast as evil characters and crazy psychos in various roles on film and TV. Even though being cast in a Swedish vampire film, his character of Håkan was this time a bit more complex then just \"evil\"; in director Tomas Alfredson's popular success feature \"Låt den rätte komma in (Let the Right One In)\" in 2008. Previously he had worked with Tomas Alfredson and his \"Killinggänget\" group in their film \"En liten film.. (A Little Film..)\" in 1999, where he had a small key part as an absent-minded boss.\n\nBeing versatile in the entertainment field, Per Ragnar has also worked as a TV presenter and host for the Swedish morning show \"Gomorron Sverige!\" (\"Good Morning Sweden!\"). He has also written a number of books, including a book on Hitler and his closed community of friends and party members, and one on Martin Luther's Christian philosophy. His most recent book is called \"Om bland tusen stjärnor: en tankebok om döden (~Among Thousand Stars: A Book On Death)\", which deals with how differently all of us deals with – and approaches – the subject of death; children and adults, different religions; scientifically, spiritually and logically.\n\nPer Ragnar is also an appreciated lecturer and gives many lectures and public readings around Sweden, in various assembly halls; both on acting and around the subjects from his books and research. He is a longtime vegetarian and an outspoken pacifist, inspired by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's non-violence philosophy. He is also attracted to the ideas and concept of Martinus cosmology.\n\nIn 2009 he will play the character of Emperor Zing, Master of The Universe, in the Swedish children's sci-fi film feature \"Kenny Begins\", a film adaption of the popular Swedish children's TV-series \"Kenny Starfighter\"; about the space super hero Kenny Starfighter.\n\nPer Ragnar was married to Veronica Tigerhjärta from October 2000 to 2014.

Written at the height of the Nullification Crisis, the proclamation directly responds to the Ordinance of Nullification passed by the South Carolina legislature in November 1833. Its purpose was to subdue the Nullification Crisis created by South Carolina's ordinance and to denounce the doctrine of nullification.\n\nThe proclamation outlines the actions taken by the South Carolina legislature and rejects the insistence on state sovereignty, focusing on the preservation of the Union as the primary issue. It declares nullification to be \"incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\" The proclamation also appeals to citizens to resist the violation of the constitution.\n\nJackson's Proclamation to the People of South Carolina was written in response to the growing opposition to the Tariff of 1828, which was perceived to affect heavily in the economy of the antebellum South, and the Tariff of 1832, which cut overall revenues of the previous tariff by half but was still regarded as unconstitutional by South Carolina. The South Carolina legislature declared these tariffs to be null and void within their Ordinance of Nullification. Besides nullifying the tariffs, it also forbade the appeal of the ordinance to the Supreme Court and prohibited the federal government from collecting duties in South Carolina after February 1, 1833.\n\nThe immediate response to the Ordinance of Nullification was to substantially reduce the tariffs imposed on South Carolina and other colonies in the South. Jackson proposed this approach in his annual message to Congress on December 4, 1832, shortly before the creation of the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina.\n\nAfter issuing the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, Jackson received reports in January 1833 that the legislature had not only persisted in the nullification of the Tariff of 1828 and 1832, but also rescinded all other tariff laws passed by the federal government for revenue purposes. This action continued South Carolina's efforts to assert state sovereignty, as the state refused to financially contribute to any part of the federal financial burden. Following this, Henry Clay proposed the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which was later signed into law alongside the Force Bill by Jackson on March 2, 1833. The Compromise Tariff of 1833 called for a series of reductions at two-year intervals, culminating in the same rates as the Tariff of 1816, and was supported primarily by the South and West. The Force Bill, however, authorized the US president to employ military forces to uphold federal law. Although South Carolina nullified the Force Bill, it did rescind its earlier ordinance regarding nullification. The combination of the two bills allowed the federal government to assert its authority, while also permitting South Carolina to accept the reduced tariffs without diminishing its own stance.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a pluricentric language with four mutually intelligible standard varieties.\n\nSouth Slavic dialects historically formed a continuum. The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences. Due to population migrations, Shtokavian became the most widespread dialect in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian (which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest). Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords. During that period, the language was referred to under a variety of names, such as \"Slavic\", \"Illyrian\", or according to region, \"Bosnian\", \"Serbian\" and \"Croatian\", the latter often in combination with \"Slavonian\" or \"Dalmatian\".\n\nSerbo-Croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established. From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called \"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\"), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard. Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the names Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and sometimes Montenegrin and Bunjevac.\n\nLike other South Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian has a simple phonology, with the common five-vowel system and twenty-five consonants. Its grammar evolved from Common Slavic, with complex inflection, preserving seven grammatical cases in nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Verbs exhibit imperfective or perfective aspect, with a moderately complex tense system. Serbo-Croatian is a pro-drop language with flexible word order, subject–verb–object being the default. It can be written in Serbian Cyrillic or Gaj's Latin alphabet, whose thirty letters mutually map one-to-one, and the orthography is highly phonemic in all standards.\n\nThroughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". Since the XIX century the term \"Illyrian\" or \"Illyric\" was used quite often (thus creating confusion with the Illyrian language). Although the word \"Illyrian\" was used on a few occasions before, the widespread usage of the term began after Ljudevit Gaj and several other prominent linguists met at Ljudevit Vukotinović's house to discuss the issue in 1832. The term \"Serbo-Croatian\" was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Viennese philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously \"Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian.\" Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single official language. Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozović advocated the term \"Serbo-Croatian\" as late as 1988, claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European, Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language, but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits (‘Bosnian’ and ‘Montenegrin’). Today, use of the term \"Serbo-Croatian\" is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match. It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative, though alternative names have emerged, such as \"Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian\" (BCS), which is often seen in political contexts such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n\nOld Church Slavonic was adopted as the language of the liturgy. This language was gradually adapted to non-liturgical purposes and became known as the Croatian version of Old Slavonic. The two variants of the language, liturgical and non-liturgical, continued to be a part of the Glagolitic service as late as the middle of the 19th century. The earliest known Croatian Church Slavonic Glagolitic manuscripts are the \"Glagolita Clozianus\" and the \"Vienna Folia\" from the 11th century.\n\nThe beginning of written Serbo-Croatian can be traced from the 10th century and on when Serbo-Croatian medieval texts were written in five scripts: Latin, Glagolitic, Early Cyrillic, Bosnian Cyrillic (\"bosančica/bosanica\"), and Arebica, the last principally by Bosniak nobility. Serbo-Croatian competed with the more established literary languages of Latin and Old Slavonic in the west and Persian and Arabic in the east.\n\nOld Slavonic developed into the Serbo-Croatian variant of Church Slavonic between the 12th and 16th centuries.\n\nAmong the earliest attestations of Serbo-Croatian are the Humac tablet, dating from the 10th or 11th century, written in Bosnian Cyrillic and Glagolitic; the Plomin tablet, dating from the same era, written in Glagolitic; the Valun tablet, dated to the 11th century, written in Glagolitic and Latin; and the Inscription of Župa Dubrovačka, a Glagolitic tablet dated to the 11th century.\n\nThe Baška tablet from the late 11th century was written in Glagolitic. It is a large stone tablet found in the small Church of St. Lucy, Jurandvor on the Croatian island of Krk that contains text written mostly in Chakavian in the Croatian script. It is also important in the history of the nation as it mentions Zvonimir, the king of Croatia at the time.\n\nThe Charter of Ban Kulin of 1189, written by Ban Kulin of Bosnia, was an early Shtokavian text, written in Bosnian Cyrillic.\n\nThe luxurious and ornate representative texts of Serbo-Croatian Church Slavonic belong to the later era, when they coexisted with the Serbo-Croatian vernacular literature. The most notable are the \"Missal of Duke Novak\" from the Lika region in northwestern Croatia (1368), \"Evangel from Reims\" (1395, named after the town of its final destination), Hrvoje's Missal from Bosnia and Split in Dalmatia (1404), and the first printed book in Serbo-Croatian, the Glagolitic Missale Romanum Glagolitice (1483).\n\nDuring the 13th century Serbo-Croatian vernacular texts began to appear, the most important among them being the \"Istrian land survey\" of 1275 and the \"Vinodol Codex\" of 1288, both written in the Chakavian dialect.\n\nThe Shtokavian dialect literature, based almost exclusively on Chakavian original texts of religious provenance (missals, breviaries, prayer books) appeared almost a century later. The most important purely Shtokavian vernacular text is the Vatican Croatian Prayer Book (c. 1400).\n\nBoth the language used in legal texts and that used in Glagolitic literature gradually came under the influence of the vernacular, which considerably affected its phonological, morphological, and lexical systems. From the 14th and the 15th centuries, both secular and religious songs at church festivals were composed in the vernacular.\n\nWriters of early Serbo-Croatian religious poetry (\"začinjavci\") gradually introduced the vernacular into their works. These \"začinjavci\" were the forerunners of the rich literary production of the 16th-century literature, which, depending on the area, was Chakavian-, Kajkavian-, or Shtokavian-based. The language of religious poems, translations, miracle and morality plays contributed to the popular character of medieval Serbo-Croatian literature.\n\nOne of the earliest dictionaries, also in the Slavic languages as a whole, was the \"Bosnian–Turkish Dictionary\" of 1631 authored by Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi and was written in the Arebica script.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Serbian (led by self-taught writer and folklorist Vuk Stefanović Karadžić) and most Croatian writers and linguists (represented by the Illyrian movement and led by Ljudevit Gaj and Đuro Daničić), proposed the use of the most widespread dialect, Shtokavian, as the base for their common standard language. Karadžić standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, and Gaj and Daničić standardized the Croatian Latin alphabet, on the basis of vernacular speech phonemes and the principle of phonological spelling. In 1850 Serbian and Croatian writers and linguists signed the Vienna Literary Agreement, declaring their intention to create a unified standard. Thus a complex bi-variant language appeared, which the Serbs officially called \"Serbo-Croatian\" or \"Serbian or Croatian\" and the Croats \"Croato-Serbian\", or \"Croatian or Serbian\". Yet, in practice, the variants of the conceived common literary language served as different literary variants, chiefly differing in lexical inventory and stylistic devices. The common phrase describing this situation was that Serbo-Croatian or \"Croatian or Serbian\" was a single language. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the language of all three nations was called \"Bosnian\" until the death of administrator von Kállay in 1907, at which point the name was changed to \"Serbo-Croatian\".\n\nWith unification of the first the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes – the approach of Karadžić and the Illyrians became dominant. The official language was called \"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\" (\"srpsko-hrvatsko-slovenački\") in the 1921 constitution. In 1929, the constitution was suspended, and the country was renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, while the official language of Serbo-Croato-Slovene was reinstated in the 1931 constitution.\n\nIn June 1941, the Nazi puppet Independent State of Croatia began to rid the language of \"Eastern\" (Serbian) words, and shut down Serbian schools.\n\nOn January 15, 1944, the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) declared Croatian, Serbian, Slovene, and Macedonian to be equal in the entire territory of Yugoslavia. In 1945 the decision to recognize Croatian and Serbian as separate languages was reversed in favor of a single Serbo-Croatian or Croato-Serbian language. In the Communist-dominated second Yugoslavia, ethnic issues eased to an extent, but the matter of language remained blurred and unresolved.\n\nIn 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that \"Serbo-Croatian\" should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional \"Serbian\" and \"Croatian\" were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a \"pravopis\". During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the \"Pravopisni rječnik\" came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.\n\nWest European scientists judge the Yugoslav language policy as an exemplary one: although three-quarters of the population spoke one language, no single language was official on a federal level. Official languages were declared only at the level of constituent republics and provinces, and very generously: Vojvodina had five (among them Slovak and Romanian, spoken by 0.5 per cent of the population), and Kosovo four (Albanian, Turkish, Romany and Serbo-Croatian). Newspapers, radio and television studios used sixteen languages, fourteen were used as languages of tuition in schools, and nine at universities. Only the Yugoslav Army used Serbo-Croatian as the sole language of command, with all other languages represented in the army’s other activities—however, this is not different from other armies of multilingual states, or in other specific institutions, such as international air traffic control where English is used worldwide. All variants of Serbo-Croatian were used in state administration and republican and federal institutions. Both Serbian and Croatian variants were represented in respectively different grammar books, dictionaries, school textbooks and in books known as pravopis (which detail spelling rules). Serbo-Croatian was a kind of soft standardisation. However, legal equality could not dampen the prestige Serbo-Croatian had: since it was the language of three quarters of the population, it functioned as an unofficial lingua franca. And within Serbo-Croatian, the Serbian variant, with twice as many speakers as the Croatian, enjoyed greater prestige, reinforced by the fact that Slovene and Macedonian speakers preferred it to the Croatian variant because their languages are also Ekavian. This is a common situation in other pluricentric languages, e.g. the variants of German differ according to their prestige, the variants of Portuguese too. Moreover, all languages differ in terms of prestige: \"the fact is that languages (in terms of prestige, learnability etc.) are not equal, and the law cannot make them equal\".\n\nIn 2017, the \"Declaration of the Common Language\" (\"Deklaracija o zajedničkom jeziku\"), signed by a group of NGOs and linguists from former Yugoslavia, argues that all variants belong to a common polycentric language.\n\nThe total number of persons who declared their native language as either 'Bosnian', 'Croatian', 'Serbian', 'Montenegrin', or 'Serbo-Croatian' in countries of the region is about 16 million.\n\nSerbian is spoken by about 9.5 million, mostly in Serbia (6.7m), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1.4m), and Montenegro (0.4m). Serbian minorities are found in the Republic of Macedonia and in Romania. In Serbia, there are about 760,000 second-language speakers of Serbian, including Hungarians in Vojvodina and the 400,000 estimated Roma. Familiarity of Kosovo Albanians with Serbian in Kosovo varies depending on age and education, and exact numbers are not available.\n\nCroatian is spoken by roughly 4.8 million, including some 575,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A small Croatian minority that lives in Italy, known as Molise Croats, have somewhat preserved traces of the Croatian language. In Croatia, 170,000, mostly Italians and Hungarians, use it as a second language.\n\nBosnian is spoken by 2.2 million people, chiefly Bosniaks, including about 220,000 in Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nThe notion of Montenegrin as a separate standard from Serbian is relatively recent. In the 2003 census, around 150,000 Montenegrins, of the country's 620,000, declared Montenegrin as their native language. That figure is likely to increase, due to the country's independence and strong institutional backing of Montenegrin language.\n\nSerbo-Croatian is also a second language of many Slovenians and Macedonians, especially those born during the time of Yugoslavia. According to the 2002 Census, Serbo-Croatian and its variants have the largest number of speakers of the minority languages in Slovenia.\n\nOutside the Balkans, there are over 2 million native speakers of the language(s), especially in countries which are frequent targets of immigration, such as Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden and the United States.\n\nSerbo-Croatian is a highly inflected language. Traditional grammars list seven cases for nouns and adjectives: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental, reflecting the original seven cases of Proto-Slavic, and indeed older forms of Serbo-Croatian itself. However, in modern Shtokavian the locative has almost merged into dative (the only difference is based on accent in some cases), and the other cases can be shown declining; namely:\n\nLike most Slavic languages, there are mostly three genders for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, a distinction which is still present even in the plural (unlike Russian and, in part, the Čakavian dialect). They also have two numbers: singular and plural. However, some consider there to be three numbers (paucal or \"dual,\" too), since (still preserved in closely related Slovene) after two (\"dva\", \"dvije\"/\"dve\"), three (\"tri\") and four (\"četiri\"), and all numbers ending in them (e.g. twenty-two, ninety-three, one hundred four) the genitive singular is used, and after all other numbers five (\"pet\") and up, the genitive plural is used. (The number one [\"jedan\"] is treated as an adjective.) Adjectives are placed in front of the noun they modify and must agree in both case and number with it.\n\nThere are seven tenses for verbs: past, present, future, exact future, aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect; and three moods: indicative, imperative, and conditional. However, the latter three tenses are typically used only in Shtokavian writing, and the time sequence of the exact future is more commonly formed through an alternative construction.\n\nIn addition, like most Slavic languages, the Shtokavian verb also has one of two aspects: perfective or imperfective. Most verbs come in pairs, with the perfective verb being created out of the imperfective by adding a prefix or making a stem change. The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration. Some Štokavian tenses (namely, aorist and imperfect) favor a particular aspect (but they are rarer or absent in Čakavian and Kajkavian). Actually, aspects \"compensate\" for the relative lack of tenses, because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time.\n\nThe Serbo-Croatian vowel system is simple, with only five vowels in Shtokavian. All vowels are monophthongs. The oral vowels are as follows:\n\nThe vowels can be short or long, but the phonetic quality does not change depending on the length. In a word, vowels can be long in the stressed syllable and the syllables following it, never in the ones preceding it.\n\nThe consonant system is more complicated, and its characteristic features are series of affricate and palatal consonants. As in English, voice is phonemic, but aspiration is not.\n\nIn consonant clusters all consonants are either voiced or voiceless. All the consonants are voiced if the last consonant is normally voiced or voiceless if the last consonant is normally voiceless. This rule does not apply to approximantsa consonant cluster may contain voiced approximants and voiceless consonants; as well as to foreign words (\"Washington\" would be transcribed as \"VašinGton\"), personal names and when consonants are not inside of one syllable.\n\nApart from Slovene, Serbo-Croatian is the only Slavic language with a pitch accent (simple tone) system. This feature is present in some other Indo-European languages, such as Swedish, Norwegian, and Ancient Greek. Neo-Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian, which is used as the basis for standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian, has four \"accents\", which involve either a rising or falling tone on either long or short vowels, with optional post-tonic lengths:\n\nThe tone stressed vowels can be approximated in English with \"set\" vs. \"setting?\" said in isolation for a short tonic \"e,\" or \"leave\" vs. \"leaving?\" for a long tonic \"i,\" due to the prosody of final stressed syllables in English.\n\nGeneral accent rules in the standard language:\n\n\nThere are no other rules for accent placement, thus the accent of every word must be learned individually; furthermore, in inflection, accent shifts are common, both in type and position (the so-called \"mobile paradigms\"). The second rule is not strictly obeyed, especially in borrowed words.\n\nComparative and historical linguistics offers some clues for memorising the accent position: If one compares many standard Serbo-Croatian words to e.g. cognate Russian words, the accent in the Serbo-Croatian word will be one syllable before the one in the Russian word, with the rising tone. Historically, the rising tone appeared when the place of the accent shifted to the preceding syllable (the so-called \"Neoshtokavian retraction\"), but the quality of this new accent was different – its melody still \"gravitated\" towards the original syllable. Most Shtokavian dialects (Neoshtokavian) dialects underwent this shift, but Chakavian, Kajkavian and the Old Shtokavian dialects did not.\n\nAccent diacritics are not used in the ordinary orthography, but only in the linguistic or language-learning literature (e.g. dictionaries, orthography and grammar books). However, there are very few minimal pairs where an error in accent can lead to misunderstanding.\n\nSerbo-Croatian orthography is almost entirely phonetic. Thus, most words should be spelled as they are pronounced. In practice, the writing system does not take into account allophones which occur as a result of interaction between words:\n\nAlso, there are some exceptions, mostly applied to foreign words and compounds, that favor morphological/etymological over phonetic spelling:\n\nOne systemic exception is that the consonant clusters ds and dš do not change into ts and tš (although \"d\" tends to be unvoiced in normal speech in such clusters):\n\nOnly a few words are intentionally \"misspelled\", mostly in order to resolve ambiguity:\n\nThrough history, this language has been written in a number of writing systems:\n\nThe oldest texts since the 11th century are in Glagolitic, and the oldest preserved text written completely in the Latin alphabet is \"Red i zakon sestara reda Svetog Dominika\", from 1345. The Arabic alphabet had been used by Bosniaks; Greek writing is out of use there, and Arabic and Glagolitic persisted so far partly in religious liturgies.\n\nToday, it is written in both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Serbian and Bosnian variants use both alphabets, while Croatian uses the Latin only.\n\nLatin script has become more and more popular in Serbia, as it is easy to input on phones and computers.\n\nThe Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was revised by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić in the 19th century.\n\nThe Croatian Latin alphabet (\"Gajica\") followed suit shortly afterwards, when Ljudevit Gaj defined it as standard Latin with five extra letters that had diacritics, apparently borrowing much from Czech, but also from Polish, and inventing the unique digraphs \"lj\", \"nj\" and \"dž\". These digraphs are represented as \"ļ, ń and ǵ\" respectively in the \"Rječnik hrvatskog ili srpskog jezika\", published by the former Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb. The latter digraphs, however, are unused in the literary standard of the language. All in all, this makes Serbo-Croatian the only Slavic language to officially use both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts, albeit the Latin version is more commonly used.\n\nIn both cases, spelling is phonetic and spellings in the two alphabets map to each other one-to-one:\n\nLatin to Cyrillic\n\nCyrillic to Latin\n\nThe digraphs \"Lj\", \"Nj\" and \"Dž\" represent distinct phonemes and are considered to be single letters. In crosswords, they are put into a single square, and in sorting, lj follows l and nj follows n, except in a few words where the individual letters are pronounced separately. For instance, \"nadživ(j)eti\" \"to outlive\" is composed of the prefix \"nad-\" \"out, over\" and the verb \"živ(j)eti\" \"to live\". The Cyrillic alphabet avoids such ambiguity by providing a single letter for each phoneme.\n\n\"Đ\" used to be commonly written as \"Dj\" on typewriters, but that practice led to too many ambiguities. It is also used on car license plates. Today \"Dj\" is often used again in place of \"Đ\" on the Internet as a replacement due to the lack of installed Serbo-Croat keyboard layouts.\n\nUnicode has separate characters for the digraphs lj (Ǉ, ǈ, ǉ), nj (Ǌ, ǋ, ǌ) and dž (Ǆ, ǅ, ǆ).\n\nSouth Slavic historically formed a dialect continuum, i.e. each dialect has some similarities with the neighboring one, and differences grow with distance. However, migrations from the 16th to 18th centuries resulting from the spread of Ottoman Empire on the Balkans have caused large-scale population displacement that broke the dialect continuum into many geographical pockets. Migrations in the 20th century, primarily caused by urbanization and wars, also contributed to the reduction of dialectal differences.\n\nThe primary dialects are named after the most common question word for \"what\": Shtokavian uses the pronoun \"što\" or \"šta\", Chakavian uses \"ča\" or \"ca\", Kajkavian (\"kajkavski\"), \"kaj\" or \"kej\". In native terminology they are referred to as \"nar(j)ečje\", which would be equivalent of \"group of dialects\", whereas their many subdialects are referred to as \"dijalekti \"\"dialects\" or \"govori \"\"speeches\".\n\nThe pluricentric Serbo-Croatian standard language and all four contemporary standard variants are based on the Eastern Herzegovinian subdialect of Neo-Shtokavian. Other dialects are not taught in schools or used by the state media. The Torlakian dialect is often added to the list, though sources usually note that it is a transitional dialect between Shtokavian and the Bulgaro-Macedonian dialects.\n\nThe Serbo-Croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after, but also heavily in phonology, accentuation and intonation, case endings and tense system (morphology) and basic vocabulary. In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have been replaced by Štokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries. These migrations caused the koinéisation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, Štokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where non-literary dialects are still being spoken.\n\nThe differences among the dialects can be illustrated on the example of Schleicher's fable. Diacritic signs are used to show the difference in accents and prosody, which are often quite significant, but which are not reflected in the usual orthography.\n\nA basic distinction among the dialects is in the reflex of the long Common Slavic vowel \"jat\", usually transcribed as *ě. Depending on the reflex, the dialects are divided into Ikavian, Ekavian, and Ijekavian, with the reflects of \"jat\" being /i/, /e/, and /ije/ or /je/ respectively. The long and short \"jat\" is reflected as long or short */i/ and /e/ in Ikavian and Ekavian, but Ijekavian dialects introduce a \"ije\"/\"je\" alternation to retain a distinction.\n\nStandard Croatian and Bosnian are based on Ijekavian, whereas Serbian uses both Ekavian and Ijekavian forms (Ijekavian for Bosnian Serbs, Ekavian for most of Serbia). Influence of standard language through state media and education has caused non-standard varieties to lose ground to the literary forms.\n\nThe jat-reflex rules are not without exception. For example, when short \"jat\" is preceded by \"r\", in most Ijekavian dialects developed into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. The prefix \"prě-\" (\"trans-, over-\") when long became \"pre-\" in eastern Ijekavian dialects but to \"prije-\" in western dialects; in Ikavian pronunciation, it also evolved into \"pre-\" or \"prije-\" due to potential ambiguity with \"pri-\" (\"approach, come close to\"). For verbs that had \"-ěti \" in their infinitive, the past participle ending \"-ěl\" evolved into \"-io\" in Ijekavian Neoštokavian.\n\nThe following are some examples:\n\nEnisa Kafadar argues that there is only one Serbo-Croatian language with several varieties. This has made it possible to include all four varieties in a new grammar book. Daniel Bunčić concludes that it is a pluricentric language, with four standard variants spoken in Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The mutual intelligibility between their speakers \"exceeds that between the standard variants of English, French, German, or Spanish\". Other linguists have argued that the differences between the variants of Serbo-Croatian are less significant than those between the variants of English, German, Dutch, and Hindi–Urdu.\n\nAmong pluricentric languages, Serbo-Croatian was the only one with a pluricentric standardisation within one state. The dissolution of Yugoslavia has made Serbo-Croatian even more of a typical pluricentric language, since the variants of other pluricentric languages are also spoken in different states.\n\nThe current Serbian constitution of 2006 refers to the official language as \"Serbian\", while the Montenegrin constitution of 2007 proclaimed \"Montenegrin\" as the primary official language, but also grants other languages the right of official use.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has specified different Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) numbers for Croatian \"(UDC 862,\" abbreviation hr) and Serbian \"(UDC 861\", abbreviation sr), while the cover term \"Serbo-Croatian\" is used to refer to the combination of original signs (\"UDC 861/862,\" abbreviation sh). Furthermore, the \"ISO 639\" standard designates the Bosnian language with the abbreviations bos and bs.\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia considers what it calls \"BCS\" (Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian) to be the main language of all Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian defendants. The indictments, documents, and verdicts of the ICTY are not written with any regard for consistently following the grammatical prescriptions of any of the three standardsbe they Serbian, Croatian, or Bosnian.\n\nFor utilitarian purposes, the Serbo-Croatian language is often called \"naš jezik\" (\"our language\") or \"naški\" (sic. \"Ourish\" or \"Ourian\") by native speakers. This politically correct term is frequently used to describe the Serbo-Croatian language by those who wish to avoid nationalistic and linguistic discussions.\n\nThe majority of mainstream Serbian linguists consider Serbian and Croatian to be one language, that is called Serbo-Croatian (\"srpskohrvatski\") or Croato-Serbian (\"hrvatskosrpski\"). A minority of Serbian linguists are of the opinion that Serbo-Croatian did exist, but has, in the meantime, dissolved.\n\nThe opinion of the majority of Croatian linguists is that there has never been a Serbo-Croatian language, but two different standard languages that overlapped sometime in the course of history. However, Croatian linguist Snježana Kordić has been leading an academic discussion on this issue in the Croatian journal \"Književna republika\" from 2001 to 2010. In the discussion, she shows that linguistic criteria such as mutual intelligibility, the huge overlap in the linguistic system, and the same dialect basis of the standard language are evidence that Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin are four national variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language. Igor Mandić states: \"During the last ten years, it has been the longest, the most serious and most acrid discussion (…) in 21st-century Croatian culture\". Inspired by that discussion, a monograph on language and nationalism has been published.\n\nThe view of the majority of Croatian linguists that there is no single Serbo-Croatian language but several different standard languages has been sharply criticized by German linguist Bernhard Gröschel in his monograph \"Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics\".\n\nA more detailed overview, incorporating arguments from Croatian philology and contemporary linguistics, would be as follows:\n\nThe linguistic debate in this region is more about politics than about linguistics per se.\n\nThe topic of language for writers from Dalmatia and Dubrovnik prior to the 19th century made a distinction only between speakers of Italian or Slavic, since those were the two main groups that inhabited Dalmatian city-states at that time. Whether someone spoke Croatian or Serbian was not an important distinction then, as the two languages were not distinguished by most speakers. This has been used as an argument to state that Croatian literature Croatian per se, but also includes Serbian and other languages that are part of Serbo-Croatian, These facts undermine the Croatian language proponents' argument that modern-day Croatian is based on a language called Old Croatian.\n\nHowever, most intellectuals and writers from Dalmatia who used the Štokavian dialect and practiced the Catholic faith saw themselves as part of a Croatian nation as far back as the mid-16th to 17th centuries, some 300 years before Serbo-Croatian ideology appeared. Their loyalty was first and foremost to Catholic Christendom, but when they professed an ethnic identity, they referred to themselves as \"Slovin\" and \"Illyrian\" (a sort of forerunner of Catholic baroque pan-Slavism) and Croatthese 30-odd writers over the span of c. 350 years always saw themselves as Croats first and never as part of a Serbian nation. It should also be noted that, in the pre-national era, Catholic religious orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat ethnic identity in Dalmatia. A Croatian follower of Vuk Karadžić, Ivan Broz, noted that for a Dalmatian to identify oneself as a Serb was seen as foreign as identifying oneself as Macedonian or Greek. Vatroslav Jagić pointed out in 1864:\n\nOn the other hand, the opinion of Jagić from 1864 is argued not to have firm grounds. When Jagić says \"Croatian\", he refers to a few cases referring to the Dubrovnik vernacular as \"ilirski\" (Illyrian). This was a common name for all Slavic vernaculars in Dalmatian cities among the Roman inhabitants. In the meantime, other written monuments are found that mention \"srpski\", \"lingua serviana\" (= Serbian), and some that mention Croatian. By far the most competent Serbian scientist on the Dubrovnik language issue, Milan Rešetar, who was born in Dubrovnik himself, wrote behalf of language characteristics: \"The one who thinks that Croatian and Serbian are two separate languages must confess that Dubrovnik always (linguistically) used to be Serbian.\"\n\nFinally, the former \"medieval\" texts from Dubrovnik and Montenegro dating before the 16th century were neither true Štokavian nor Serbian, but mostly specific a Jekavian-Čakavian that was nearer to actual Adriatic islanders in Croatia.\n\nNationalists have conflicting views about the language(s). The nationalists among the Croats conflictingly claim either that they speak an entirely separate language from Serbs and Bosniaks or that these two peoples have, due to the longer lexicographic tradition among Croats, somehow \"borrowed\" their standard languages from them. Bosniak nationalists claim that both Croats and Serbs have \"appropriated\" the Bosnian language, since Ljudevit Gaj and Vuk Karadžić preferred the Neoštokavian-Ijekavian dialect, widely spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the basis for language standardization, whereas the nationalists among the Serbs claim either that any divergence in the language is artificial, or claim that the Štokavian dialect is theirs and the Čakavian Croats'— in more extreme formulations Croats have \"taken\" or \"stolen\" their language from the Serbs. \n\nProponents of unity among Southern Slavs claim that there is a single language with normal dialectal variations. The term \"Serbo-Croatian\" (or synonyms) is not officially used in any of the successor countries of former Yugoslavia.\n\nIn Serbia, the Serbian standard has an official status countrywide, while both Serbian and Croatian are official in the province of Vojvodina. A large Bosniak minority is present in the southwest region of Sandžak, but the \"official recognition\" of Bosnian language is moot. Bosnian is an optional course in 1st and 2nd grade of the elementary school, while it is also in official use in the municipality of Novi Pazar. However, its nomenclature is controversial, as there is incentive that it is referred to as \"Bosniak\" (\"bošnjački\") rather than \"Bosnian\" (\"bosanski\") (see Bosnian language#Controversy and recognition for details).\n\nCroatian is the official language of Croatia, while Serbian is also official in municipalities with significant Serb population.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, all three standard languages are recorded as official but in practice and media, mostly Bosnian and Serbian are applied. Confrontations have on occasion been absurd.

There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), and generally extends from ; from the high end of the medium frequency band (MF) just above the mediumwave AM broadcast band, to the end of the HF band.\n\nRadio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon. This is called skywave or \"skip\" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about . Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. It is also used for military over-the-horizon radar, diplomatic communication, and two-way international communication by amateur radio enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes, as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications.\n\nThe widest popular definition of the shortwave frequency interval is the ITU Region 1 (EU+Africa+Russia...) definition, and is the span 1.6–30 MHz, just above the medium wave band, which ends approximately at 1.6 MHz.\n\nThere are also other definitions of the shortwave frequency interval:\n\nThe name \"shortwave\" originated during the early days of radio in the early 20th century, when the radio spectrum was considered divided into long wave (LW), medium wave (MW) and short wave bands based on the wavelength of the radio waves. Shortwave radio received its name because the wavelengths in this band are relatively shorter than 200 m (1,500 kHz) which marked the original upper limit of the medium frequency band first used for radio communications. The broadcast medium wave band now extends above the 200 m/1,500 kHz limit, and the amateur radio 1.8 MHz – 2.0 MHz band (known as the \"top band\") is the lowest-frequency band considered to be 'shortwave'. \n\nEarly long distance radio telegraphy used long waves, below 300 kilohertz (kHz). The drawbacks to this system included a very limited spectrum available for long distance communication, and the very expensive transmitters, receivers and gigantic antennas that were required. It was also difficult to beam the radio wave directionally with long wave, resulting in a major loss of power over long distances. Prior to the 1920s, the shortwave frequencies above 1.5 MHz were regarded as useless for long distance communication and were designated in many countries for amateur use.\n\nGuglielmo Marconi, pioneer of radio, commissioned his assistant Charles Samuel Franklin to carry out a large scale study into the transmission characteristics of short wavelength waves and to determine their suitability for long distance transmissions. Franklin rigged up a large antenna at Poldhu Wireless Station, Cornwall, running on 25 kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht \"Elettra\" in the Cape Verde Islands.\n\nIn September 1924, Marconi transmitted daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut. Franklin went on to refine the directional transmission, by inventing the curtain array aerial system. In July 1924, Marconi entered into contracts with the British General Post Office (GPO) to install high speed shortwave telegraphy circuits from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the Imperial Wireless Chain. The UK-to-Canada shortwave \"Beam Wireless Service\" went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927.\n\nShortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s, similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, more than half of long distance communications had moved from transoceanic cables and longwave wireless services to shortwave and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave stations had cost and efficiency advantages over massive longwave wireless installations, however some commercial longwave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s. Long distance radio circuits also reduced the load on the existing transoceanic telegraph cables and hence the need for new cables, although the cables maintained their advantages of high security and a much more reliable and better quality signal than shortwave.\n\nThe cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927, and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests. The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference in 1928 \"to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services\". It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929, Imperial and International Communications Ltd. The name of the company was changed to Cable and Wireless Ltd. in 1934.\n\nLong-distance cables had a resurgence beginning in 1956 with the laying of TAT-1 across the Atlantic Ocean, the first voice frequency cable on this route. This provided 36 high quality telephone channels and was soon followed by even higher capacity cables all around the world. These sounded the death knell of shortwave radio for commercial communications.\n\nAmateur radio operators also discovered that long-distance communication was possible on shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used surface wave propagation at very low frequencies, which are attenuated along the path at wavelengths shorter than 1,000 meters. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal loss. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.\n\nRadio amateurs may have conducted the first successful transatlantic tests in December 1921, operating in the 200 meter mediumwave band (near 1,500 kHz in the modern AM broadcast band) – the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe on 200 meters and at least 20 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two-way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200 meters. Although operation on wavelengths shorter than 200 meters was technically illegal (but tolerated as the authorities mistakenly believed at first that such frequencies were useless for commercial or military use), amateurs began to experiment with those wavelengths using newly available vacuum tubes shortly after World War I.\n\nExtreme interference at the longer edge of the 150–200 meter band – the official wavelengths allocated to amateurs by the Second National Radio Conference in 1923 – forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths; however, amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150 meters (2 MHz). A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications at wavelengths shorter than 150 meters completed hundreds of long distance two way contacts on 100 meters (3 MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two way contacts.\n\nBy 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6,000 miles (9,600 km) and more. On 21 September 1924 several amateurs in California completed two-way contacts with an amateur in New Zealand. On 19 October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90 minute two-way contact nearly halfway around the world. On 10 October the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs at 80 meters (3.75 MHz), 40 meters (7 MHz) and 20 meters (14 MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the 10 meter band (28 MHz) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference on 25 November 1927. The 15 meter band (21 MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1 May 1952.\n\nShortwave radio frequency energy is capable of reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by ionospheric reflection back to the earth by the ionosphere, (a phenomenon known as \"skywave propagation\"). A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a skip zone where reception fails. With a fixed working frequency, large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night.\n\nAs a result of the multi-layer structure of the ionosphere, propagation often simultaneously occurs on different paths,\nscattered by the E or F region and with different numbers of hops, a phenomenon that may be disturbed for certain techniques. Particularly for lower frequencies of the shortwave band, absorption of radio frequency energy in the lowest ionospheric layer, the D layer, may impose a serious limit. This is due to collisions of electrons with neutral molecules, absorbing some of a radio frequency's energy and converting it to heat. Predictions of skywave propagation depend on:\n\nSeveral different types of modulation are used to incorporate information in a short-wave signal.\n\nAmplitude modulation is the simplest type and the most commonly used for shortwave broadcasting. The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal (speech, or music, for example). At the receiver, a simple detector recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier.\n\nSingle sideband transmission is a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation. An amplitude-modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the carrier frequency. If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier, only the remaining set is transmitted. This reduces power in the transmission, as roughly of the energy sent by an AM signal is in the “carrier”, which is not needed to recover the information contained in the signal. It also reduces signal bandwidth, enabling less than one-half the AM signal bandwidth to be used.\n\nThe drawback is the receiver is more complicated, since it must re-create the carrier to recover the signal. Small errors in the detection process greatly affect the pitch of the received signal. As a result, single sideband is not used for music or general broadcast. Single sideband is used for long-range voice communications by ships and aircraft, Citizen's Band, and amateur radio operators. Lower sideband (LSB) is customarilly used below 9 MHz and USB (upper sideband) above 9 MHz.\n\nVestigal sideband transmits the carrier and one complete sideband, but filters out the other sideband. It is a compromise between AM and SSB, enabing simple receivers to be used, but requires almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It can be heard in the transmission of certain radio time signal stations. Vestigial sideband is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and digital.\n\nNarrow-band frequency modulation (NBFM or NFM) is used typically above 20 MHz. Because of the larger bandwidth required, NBFM is commonly used for VHF communication. Regulations limit the bandwidth of a signal transmitted in the HF bands, and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth. NBFM is limited to short-range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere.\n\nDigital Radio Mondiale (DRM) is a digital modulation for use on bands below 30 MHz. It is a digital signal, like the data modes, below, but is for transmitting audio, like the analog modes above.\n\nContinuous wave (CW) is on-and-off keying of a carrier, used for Morse code communications and Hellschreiber facsimile-based teleprinter transmissions. It is a data mode, although often listed separately.\n\nRadioteletype, fax, digital, slow-scan television, and other systems use forms of frequency-shift keying or audio subcarriers on a shortwave carrier. These generally require special equipment to decode, such as software on a computer equipped with a sound card.\n\nNote that on modern computer-driven systems, digital modes are typically sent by coupling a computer's sound output to the SSB input of a radio.\n\nSome established users of the shortwave radio bands may include:\n\nSporadic or non-traditional users of the shortwave bands may include:\n\n\"See International broadcasting for details on the history and practice of broadcasting to foreign audiences.\"\n\n\"See Shortwave relay station for the actual kinds of integrated technologies used to bring high power signals to listeners.\"\n\nThe World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organized under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union, allocates bands for various services in conferences every few years. The last WRC took place in 2007.\n\nAt WRC-97 in 1997, the following bands were allocated for international broadcasting. AM shortwave broadcasting channels are allocated with a 5 kHz separation for traditional analog audio broadcasting.\n\nAlthough countries generally follow the table above, there may be small differences between countries or regions. For example, in the official bandplan of the Netherlands, the 49 m band starts at 5.95 MHz, the 41 m band ends at 7.45 MHz, the 11 m band starts at 25.67 MHz, and the 120, 90 and 60 m bands are absent altogether. Additionally, international broadcasters sometimes operate outside the normal WRC-allocated bands or use off-channel frequencies. This is done for practical reasons, or to attract attention in crowded bands (60m, 49m, 40m, 41m, 31m, 25m).\n\nThe new digital audio broadcasting format for shortwave DRM operates 10 kHz or 20 kHz channels. There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM, as it mainly transmitted in 10 kHz format.\n\nThe power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and over-the-horizon radar. Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized antenna designs (like the ALLISS antenna technology) to concentrate radio energy at the target area.\n\nShortwave does possess a number of advantages over newer technologies, including the following:\n\nShortwave radio's benefits are sometimes regarded as being outweighed by its drawbacks, including:\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Telecommunity estimates that there are approximately 600 million shortwave broadcast-radio receivers in use in 2002. WWCR claims that there are 1.5 billion shortwave receivers worldwide.\n\nMany hobbyists listen to shortwave broadcasters. In some cases, the goal is to hear as many stations from as many countries as possible \"(DXing)\"; others listen to specialized shortwave utility, or \"ute\", transmissions such as maritime, naval, aviation, or military signals. Others focus on intelligence signals from numbers stations, stations which transmit strange broadcast usually for intelligence operations, or the two way communications by amateur radio operators. Some short wave listeners behave analogously to \"lurkers\" on the Internet, in that they listen only and never make any attempt to send out their own signals. Other listeners participate in clubs, or actively send and receive QSL cards, or become involved with amateur radio and start transmitting on their own.\n\nMany listeners tune the shortwave bands for the programmes of stations broadcasting to a general audience (such as Radio Taiwan International, China Radio International, Voice of America, Radio France Internationale, BBC World Service, Voice of Korea, Radio Free Sarawak etc.). Today, through the evolution of the Internet, the hobbyist can listen to shortwave signals via remotely controlled or web controlled shortwave receivers around the world, even without owning a shortwave radio. Many international broadcasters offer live streaming audio on their websites and a number have closed their shortwave service entirely, or severely curtailed it, in favour of internet transmission.\n\nShortwave listeners, or SWLs, can obtain QSL cards from broadcasters, utility stations or amateur radio operators as trophies of the hobby. Some stations even give out special certificates, pennants, stickers and other tokens and promotional materials to shortwave listeners.\n\nSome musicians have been attracted to the unique aural characteristics of shortwave radio which—due to the nature of amplitude modulation, varying propagation conditions, and the presence of interference—generally has lower fidelity than local broadcasts (particularly via FM stations). Shortwave transmissions often have bursts of distortion, and \"hollow\" sounding loss of clarity at certain aural frequencies, altering the harmonics of natural sound and creating at times a strange \"spacey\" quality due to echoes and phase distortion. Evocations of shortwave reception distortions have been incorporated into rock and classical compositions, by means of delays or feedback loops, equalizers, or even playing shortwave radios as live instruments. Snippets of broadcasts have been mixed into electronic sound collages and live musical instruments, by means of analogue tape loops or digital samples. Sometimes the sounds of instruments and existing musical recordings are altered by remixing or equalizing, with various distortions added, to replicate the garbled effects of shortwave radio reception.\n\nThe first attempts by serious composers to incorporate radio effects into music may be those of the Russian physicist and musician Léon Theremin, who perfected a form of radio oscillator as a musical instrument in 1928 (regenerative circuits in radios of the time were prone to breaking into oscillation, adding various tonal harmonics to music and speech); and in the same year, the development of a French instrument called the Ondes Martenot by its inventor Maurice Martenot, a French cellist and former wireless telegrapher. Karlheinz Stockhausen used shortwave radio and effects in works including \"Hymnen\" (1966–67), \"Kurzwellen\" (1968)—adapted for the Beethoven Bicentennial in \"Opus 1970\" with filtered and distorted snippets of Beethoven pieces—\"Spiral\" (1968), \"Pole\", \"Expo\" (both 1969–70), and \"Michaelion\" (1997).\n\nCypriot composer Yannis Kyriakides incorporated shortwave numbers station transmissions in his 1999 \"ConSPIracy cantata\".\n\nHolger Czukay, a student of Stockhausen, was one of the first to use shortwave in a rock music context. In 1975, German electronic music band Kraftwerk recorded a full length concept album around simulated radiowave and shortwave sounds, entitled \"Radio-Activity\". The The's Radio Cineola monthly broadcasts drew heavily on shortwave radio sound.\n\nThe development of direct broadcasts from satellites has reduced the demand for shortwave receiver hardware, but there are still a great number of shortwave broadcasters. A new digital radio technology, Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), is expected to improve the quality of shortwave audio from very poor to standards comparable to the FM broadcast band. The future of shortwave radio is threatened by the rise of power line communication (PLC), also known as Broadband over Power Lines (BPL), which uses a data stream transmitted over unshielded power lines. As the BPL frequencies used overlap with shortwave bands, severe distortions can make listening to analog shortwave radio signals near power lines difficult or impossible.\n\nExperts disagree on the future of shortwave. According to Andy Sennitt, former editor of the World Radio TV Handbook, “shortwave is a legacy technology, which is expensive and environmentally unfriendly. A few countries are hanging on to it, but most have faced up to the fact that the glory days of shortwave have gone. Religious broadcasters will still use it because they are not too concerned with listening figures\".\n\nHowever Thomas Witherspoon, editor of shortwave news site SWLingPost.com wrote that “shortwave remains the most accessible international communications medium that still provides listeners with the protection of complete anonymity\". According to Nigel Fry, head of Distribution for the BBC World Service Group, “I still see a place for shortwave in the 21st century, especially for reaching areas of the world that are prone to natural disasters that destroy local broadcasting and Internet infrastructure\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4311578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4311578", "title": "Spam poetry", "text": "Spam poetry\n\nSpam poetry, sometimes called spoetry, is poetic verse composed primarily from the subject lines or content of spam e-mail messages.\n\nSeveral writers have claimed to have created spam poetry, and consensus has not emerged about a single origin. Some early examples come from a spam poetry competition held in 2000 by the website \"Satire Wire\". Animator Don Hertzfeldt began writing spam poems in his production journal in 2004. Translator Jorge Candeias wrote Portuguese \"spoems\" daily, between 5 May 2003 and 5 May 2004, using spam subject lines as title and inspiration.\n\nA book entitled \"Machine Language\" by endwar was published in 2005 by IZEN and was followed by \"Machine Language, Version 2.1\" also by endwar in 2006. The latter edition includes a CD of spoetry read by Microsoft Sam and set to ambient musical sounds by Michael Truman who also tweaked the automated readings. Each edition indicates endwar as editor, but in the second edition he has admitted to using cut-up technique and having combined shorter pieces from the first edition, which lends more authorship to him in his creation. These pieces were also read at the opening of \"Blends & Bridges\", a concrete and visual poetry show at Gallery 324 in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 1, 2006, by endwar with the sounds by Truman backing. The experimental poet, endwar, cites his own collaboration with Ficus Strangulensis, the experimental poet, in 1995, \"The Further Last Words of Dutch Schultz\" published by IZEN as an earlier experiment in generating random text poetry, in this case, the software altered text of the bizarre last words of Dutch Schultz as published in The New York Times in 1935, as well as the cut-up influences of Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs and even the musicians Throbbing Gristle and David Bowie. The useful bits of spam for purposes of endwar's variation of spoetry, i.e., the part that is not the advertisement, but the random words assigned to trick spam filters, endwar calls \"paratext\". Endwar indicates that, in his view, \"the effect of the evolution of paratext is that computers are learning to talk to each other by in some sense imitating human texts.\" The advertisements are the human-to-human conversation in the same email sources.\n\nA book entitled 'Spam: E-mail Inspired Poems' by Ben Myers was published in 2008 by Blackheath Books Myers claims to have been writing spam poems since 1999.\n\nThe creation of spoetry is similar to Gysin and Burroughs's cut-up technique in that individual subject lines of messages are pieced together in poetic form; making the creation of spoetry an exercise not in creativity as much as in having an eye for the unexpected.\n\nThe end result can be crafted into any literary form the author desires: haiku, concrete poetry, limerick, dada, and so on. Thus, spoetry is not a literary form but rather a means of creating poetry.\n\nA related concept is spam lit, where snippets of nonsensical verse and prose are embedded in spam e-mail messages. Some of the snippets are original content, others are passages or conglomerations from public-domain works. The term was coined by a member of the Poetics listserv in 2002. In August 2006, David Kestenbaum of NPR's \"Morning Edition\" broadcast a story on \"Literary Spam\". Kestenbaum notes that Paul Graham, a programmer, \"wrote a program to find out how to best separate spam from real e-mail. To train it, he fed it a good helping of spam and a separate sample of real e-mail.\" Soon, spammers discovered the works of long-dead poets and writers as one way to circumvent Graham's anti-spam code.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20563662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20563662", "title": "Spotface", "text": "Spotface\n\nA spotface or spot face is a machined feature in which a certain region of the workpiece (a spot) is faced, providing a smooth, flat, accurately located surface. This is especially relevant on workpieces cast or forged, where the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose roughness, flatness, and location are subject to wider tolerances and thus not assured with a machining level of precision. The most common application of spotfacing (spot facing) is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done by cutting a shallow counterbore, just deep enough \"to clean up\"—that is, only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat. Other common applications of spotfacing involve facing a pad onto a boss, creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots, without the need for finishing all over (FAO). \n\nThe cutters most often used to cut spotfaces are counterbore cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills. \n\nBackspotfacing (back spot facing) is analogous to backboring, meaning that the tool manages to reach to the far side of the workpiece (away from the spindle side) and cut back toward the spindle. Such operations can be done with boring bars reaching through a hole while shifted off-center, then shifting onto center for the cut (for example, in the G76 fine boring cycle), or with back-deburring style tools whose cutting edges open and close in umbrella-like or check-valve-like fashion. Such back-cutting operations can obviate second operations, with their attendant setup time and part rehandling time. Sometimes the limiting factor in applying this advantage is the difficulty of chip clearance; the operator needs to intervene because chip nests prevent the tool from passing freely and opening and closing freely. In such cases, improved chipbreaking via different inserts in the main operation may help, and backspotfacing tools powered by coolant pressure and using through-tool coolant feed may succeed where others cannot (opening, cutting, and retracting despite some chips), not only obviating a second operation but also making the main operation less reliant on operator intervention and program stops (M00 or M01) than a lesser backspotfacing tool would. \n\nSome fastener designs can obviate spotfacing for some applications. For example, a self-aligning nut allows the nut to find its own perpendicularity to the thread axis by floating via a pair of spherical bearing surfaces (a ball-in-cup arrangement). \n\nStandards exist for the sizes of spotfaces, especially for fastener head seating areas. These standards can vary between corporations and between standards organizations. For example, in Boeing Design Manual BDM-1327 section 3.5, the nominal diameter of the spot-faced surface is the same as the nominal size of the cutter, and is equal to the flat seat diameter plus twice the fillet radius. This is in contrast to the ASME Y14.5-2009 definition of a spotface, which is equal to the flat seat diameter.\n"}

{"id": "29617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29617", "title": "Subject–verb–object", "text": "Subject–verb–object\n\nIn linguistic typology, subject–verb–object (SVO) is a sentence structure where the subject comes first, the verb second, and the object third. Languages may be classified according to the dominant sequence of these elements in unmarked sentences (i.e., sentences in which an unusual word order is not used for emphasis). The label is often used for ergative languages that do not have subjects, but have an agent–verb–object order.\n\nSVO is used in the active voice. SVO is the second-most common order by number of known languages, after SOV. Together, SVO and SOV account for more than 75% of the world's languages. It is also the most common order developed in Creole languages, suggesting that it may be somehow more initially 'obvious' to human psychology.\n\nLanguages regarded as SVO include: Albanian, Arabic dialects, Bosnian, Chinese, English, Estonian, Finnish (but see below), French, Ganda, Greek, Hausa, Icelandic (with the V2 restriction), Igbo, Italian, Javanese, Kashubian, Khmer, Latvian, Macedonian, Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian), Modern Hebrew, Polish, Portuguese, Quiche, Reo Rapa, Romanian, Rotuman, Russian (but see below), Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Thai and Lao, Ukrainian (but see below), Vietnamese, Yoruba and Zulu.\n\nAncient Greek has free syntactic order, though Classical Greeks tended to favor SOV. Many famous phrases are SVO, however.\n\nSubject–verb–object languages almost always place relative clauses after the nouns they modify and adverbial subordinators before the clause modified, with varieties of Chinese being notable exceptions.\n\nAlthough some subject–verb–object languages in West Africa, the best known being Ewe, use postpositions in noun phrases, the vast majority of them, such as English, have prepositions. Most subject–verb–object languages place genitives after the noun, but a significant minority, including the postpositional SVO languages of West Africa, the Hmong–Mien languages, some Sino-Tibetan languages, and European languages like Swedish, Danish, Lithuanian and Latvian have \"prenominal\" genitives (as would be expected in an SOV language).\n\nNon-European languages, usually subject–verb–object languages, have a strong tendency to place adjectives, demonstratives and numerals after nouns that they modify, but Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Indonesian place numerals before nouns, as in English. Some linguists have come to view the numeral as the head in the\nE relationship to fit the rigid right-branching of these languages.\n\nThere is a strong tendency, as in English, for main verbs to be preceded by auxiliaries: \"I am thinking. He should reconsider.\"\n\nAn example of SVO order in English is:\nIn analytic languages such as English, subject-verb-object order is relatively inflexible because it identifies which part of the sentence is the subject and which one is the object. (\"The dog bit Andy\" and \"Andy bit the dog\" mean two completely different things, while, in case of \"Bit Andy the dog\", it may be difficult to determine whether it's a complete sentence or a fragment, with \"Andy the dog\" the object and an omitted/implied subject.) The situation is more complex in languages that have no word order imposed by their grammar; example: Russian, Finnish, Ukrainian, and Hungarian have both the VO and OV constructs in their common word order uses.\n\nIn some languages, some word orders are considered more \"natural\" than others. In some, the order is the matter of emphasis. For example, Russian allows the use of subject-verb-object in any order and \"shuffles\" parts to bring up a slightly different contextual meaning each time. E.g. \"любит она его\" (loves she him) may be used to point out \"she acts this way because she LOVES him\", or \"его она любит\" (him she loves) is used in the context \"if you pay attention, you'll see that HE is the one she truly loves\", or \"его любит она\" (him loves she) may appear along the lines \"I agree that cat is a disaster, but since my wife adores it and I adore her...\". Regardless of order, it is clear that \"его\" is the object because it is in the accusative case. In Polish, SVO order is basic in an affirmative sentence, and a different order is used to either emphasize some part of it or to adapt it to a broader context logic. For example, \"\"Roweru\" ci nie kupię\" (I won't buy you \"a bicycle\"), \"\"Od piątej\" czekam\" (I've been waiting \"since five\").\n\nIn Turkish, it is normal to use SOV, but SVO may be used sometimes to emphasize the verb. For example, \"John terketti Mary'yi\" (Lit. \"John/left/Mary\": John left Mary) is the answer to the question \"What did John do with Mary?\" instead of the regular [SOV] sentence \"John Mary'yi terketti\" (Lit. \"John/Mary/left\").\n\nIn German, Dutch, and Kashmiri, SOV with V2 word order in main clauses coexists with SOV in subordinate clauses, as given in Example 1 below; and a change in syntax, such as by bringing an adpositional phrase to the front of the sentence for emphasis, may also dictate the use of VSO, as in Example 2. In Kashmiri, the word order in embedded clauses is conditioned by the category of the subordinating conjunction, as in Example 3. \n\nEnglish developed from such a reordering language and still bears traces of this word order, for example in locative inversion (\"In the garden sat a cat.\") and some clauses beginning with negative expressions: \"only\" (\"Only then do we find X.\"), \"not only\" (\"Not only did he storm away but also slammed the door.\"), \"under no circumstances\" (\"under no circumstances are the students allowed to use a mobile phone\"), \"never\" (\"Never have I done that.\"), \"on no account\" and the like. In such cases, \"do\"-support is sometimes required, depending on the construction.\n\n"}

Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work \"Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family\", the Sudanese system is one of the six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha and Sudanese).\n\nThe Sudanese kinship system is the most complicated of all kinship systems. It maintains a separate designation for almost every one of Ego's kin, based on their distance from Ego, their relation, and their gender. Ego's father is distinguished from Ego's father's brother and from Ego's mother's brother. Ego's mother is similarly distinguished from Ego's mother's sister and from Ego's father's sister. For cousins, there are eight possible terms.\n\nThe system is named for the peoples of South Sudan, Africa. The Sudanese kinship system also existed in ancient Latin-speaking and Anglo-Saxon cultures. It exists today among present day-Arab and Turkish cultures. It tends to co-occur with patrilineal descent, and it is often said to be common in complex and stratified cultures.\n\nVariants\n\nBalkan kinships such as Bulgarian, Serbian, and Bosniak follow this system for different patrilinear and matrilinear uncles but collapse mother's sister and father's sister into the same term of \"aunt\" and Croatian and Macedonian further collapse the offspring of the uncles into one term.\n\nOn the opposite side, Chinese system often makes a distinction between older and younger sibling of the parent (it is impossible to just say e.g. \"father's brother\" unless with circumlocution, it is either \"father's older brother\" or \"father's younger brother\"), as well as of the subject. This applies to both uncles and aunts, both patrilinear and matrilinear.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10968503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10968503", "title": "Theming", "text": "Theming\n\nTheming refers to \"the use of an overarching theme...to create a holistic and integrated spatial organization of a consumer venue.” A theme is “a unifying or dominant idea or motif”, so theming is the process of designing and constructing an object or space so that “the particular subject or idea on which the style of something is based” is made clear through the “synthesis of recognizable symbols with spatial forms.”\n\nTheming is applied to an environment in order to create a memorable and meaningful experience for individuals or groups that visit the space, and can be expressed through the use of architecture, decor, signage, music and sound design, costuming, integrated technology, special effects, and other techniques. Theming is increasingly used to create physical spaces for \"experiential marketing,” in which consumers can connect and interact with a brand.\n\nHistorically, most large-scale themed environments were primarily designed for entertainment, so the industry that creates these venues is known as themed entertainment. Examples include theme parks, water parks, museums, zoos, visitor centers, casinos, theme restaurants, and resorts. Theming is also increasingly used on smaller scale projects, including parties and product launches, to make these events more impactful.\n\nCommon themes include holidays (such as Christmas and Valentine’s Day), historical eras (such as the Medieval Period and the American frontier), cultures (such as Ancient Greece and Polynesian culture), and literary genres (such as Fantasy and Science fiction).\n\nTheming has been used in public spaces at least as far back as the World’s Fairs of the Nineteenth Century. Professor Susan Ingram argues that the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London was, in effect, the world’s first theme park, utilizing theming to further its pro-industrial message, and reproducing foreign lands as spectacle. The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago introduced a separate midway, filled not only with attractions like the first Ferris Wheel, but also exhibits of cultures from around the world, including reproductions of villages from many nations. Themed simulations, including the Italian Capri Grotto and a Hawaiian volcano, were made possible for the first time by combining electricity, theatrical displays, and mechanical devices.\n\nThemed dining can also trace its roots to the late 1800s. In the 1890s, at least three different elaborately themed nightclubs were operating Paris, using themes of death, hell, and heaven. Soon after, in response to the growing popularity of the automobile, theming was applied to roadside architecture in the United States, and buildings themselves became advertisements aimed at passing motorists. Beginning in the 1920s, a number of novelty architecture buildings were constructed in and around Hollywood, including the famous Brown Derby restaurants and Bulldog Cafe. At the same time, the popular Egyptian Revival movement saw a range of buildings themed to Ancient Egypt, including everything from apartments to Grauman's Egyptian Theatre. Dozens of so-called “programmatic” or “mimetic” style structures were built in the Los Angeles area in the interwar years of 1918-1941, many of them restaurants, including buildings shaped like animals, food, and vehicles.\n\nThe forerunners to today’s themed mega-resorts were the El Rancho Vegas, opened in 1941, and the Last Frontier, opened in 1942, the first two properties on the Las Vegas Strip, both with Wild West themes. They were followed by even more elaborately themed hotels, including Caesars Palace in 1966 and Circus Circus in 1968.\n\nThe term “theme park” came into use circa 1960, likely to describe the many parks built across the United States and around the world following the successful opening of Disneyland in 1955. Though arguably not the first theme park, Disneyland was the first amusement park to combine multiple named areas (“lands”) with different themes. Theme parks have followed this pattern ever since, including some that have explicitly copied Disneyland’s design.\n\nTheming has also been applied to retail environments. The advent of mass production led to the creation of large department stores in Europe in the late Nineteenth Century, and in an early example of theming, many used elaborate displays and windows to attract shoppers. In the 1980s, Banana Republic reinforced its brand as a travel and safari clothing company by theming its stores with Jeeps and jungle foliage. Beginning in 1987, the Disney Store chain used theming to popularize the idea of “retail-tainment,” creating a new category of entertainment stores, later copied by competitors. Today, as a response to the growth of online shopping, both individual stores and entire retail complexes like malls are turning to theming to attract customers to physical locations.\n\nIn 1997, urbanist Mark Gottdiener’s \"The Theming of America: Dreams, Visions, and Commercial Spaces\" was published. It is considered by many to be the first serious work to explore the origins, nature, and future of themed environments. A revised second edition was published in 2001.\n\nAlso in 1997, the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal presented \"The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme Parks\", the first exhibition of some 350 objects from the archives of Walt Disney Imagineering, including plans, drawings, paintings and models for the Disney theme parks and their attractions. Professor Karal Ann Marling curated the exhibit and wrote the principal essay for the accompanying 224 page book, which also included essays by Disney Imagineer Marty Sklar, historian Neil Harris, art historian Erika Doss, geographer Yi-Fu Tuan, and critic Greil Marcus, as well as an interview with architect Frank Gehry.\n\nAuthor Scott A. Lukas has written and edited numerous books and articles on themed entertainment, including his first, \"The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self\", published in 2007. He teaches on the subject of theme parks and themed spaces, video games, popular film, and various forms of popular culture and remaking.\n\nIn 2010, Dean Peter Weishar and Professor George Head began work on a themed entertainment design program at Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) in Savannah, Georgia. In the fall of 2012, the SCAD School of Film, Digital Media and Performing Arts separated into two schools: the School of Digital Media and the School of Entertainment Arts, which began offering the nation’s first M.F.A. in themed entertainment design. Peter Weishar went on to create the Themed Experience Institute program at Florida State University.\n\nAs perhaps the best known example of theming, the theme park Disneyland has often been a target for criticism. In his overwhelmingly negative review, \"Disneyland and Las Vegas\", published in \"The Nation\" upon the opening of the park, writer Julian Halevy lamented: \n\nNoted author Ray Bradbury responded with a letter to the editor, published three years later, titled \"Not Child Enough\": \n\nAnother notable criticism of theming, again targeting Disneyland and its guests, can be found in French sociologist Jean Baudrillard’s 1981 treatise \"Simulacra and Simulation\": \n\nAlong with Baudrillard, the Italian writer Umberto Eco helped develop the idea of “hyperreality,” or the world of \"the Absolute Fake,\" in which imitations don't merely reproduce reality, but try to improve on it. Eco traveled to tourist attractions across the United States and wrote frequently about \"America's obsession with simulacra and counterfeit reality.”\n\nMore recently, concerns have been raised about theming’s role in influencing consumers, sometimes subconsciously, as part of experiential retailing or “shoppertainment.” Kim Einhorm, director of Theme Traders, points out that “theming becomes an invisible form of branding.” Indeed, because theming has become such a commonplace aspect of so many people’s everyday lives, the public is often unwilling or unable to effectively understand its consequences. Some have even argued that the growth of experiential marketing is contributing to a degraded quality of life by eliminating “contemplative time.”\n\nIn 1920, following the dissolution of several earlier organizations, the National Association of Amusement Parks (NAAP) was formed. In 1934 it merged with the American Association of Pools and Beaches (AAPB) to form the National Association of Amusement Parks, Pools, and Beaches (NAAPPB). After several name changes, it became the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions in 1962. Today, IAAPA represents more than 5,300 members from more than 100 countries, including many companies and individuals in the themed entertainment industry.\n\nThe Themed Entertainment Association was founded in 1991 to organize small businesses in the industry. Today it has some 1,300 members, and divisions around the world. It hosts annual conferences and presents awards to individuals, parks, attractions, exhibits, and experiences.\n\nA number of former employees of Walt Disney Imagineering, Disney’s in-house design and construction subsidiary, went on to form their own themed entertainment companies, some of which later collaborated with Disney on theme park projects. Gary Goddard left Imagineering to start what became the Goddard Group, now known as Legacy | GGE. Bill Novey oversaw the special effects for Epcot Center and Tokyo Disneyland before leaving to start Art & Technology, Inc. Bob Rogers left to found BRC Imagination Arts. Bran Ferren founded Associates & Ferren, which was acquired by Disney in 1993. Ferren eventually left Disney to start another company, Applied Minds, LLC. Phil Hettema worked for both Disney and Universal Creative before starting The Hettema Group.\n\nOther companies serve organizations and individuals looking to incorporate theming into offices, product launch events, and even parties. Theme Traders is a London-based event theming company that serves this niche.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Word Lens used the built-in cameras on smartphones and similar devices to quickly scan and identify foreign text (such as that found in a sign or a menu), and then translate and display the words in another language on the device's display. The words were displayed in the original context on the original background, and the translation was performed in real-time without connection to the internet. For example, using the viewfinder of a camera to show a shop sign on a smartphone's display would result in a real-time image of the shop sign being displayed, but the words shown on the sign would be the translated words instead of the original foreign words.\n\nUntil early 2015, the application was available for the Apple's iPhone, iPod, and iPad, as well as for a selection of Android smartphones. The application was free on Apple's iTunes, but an in-app purchase was necessary to enable translation capabilities. On Google Play, there were both the free demo and the full translation-enabled versions of the application. At Google's unveiling of its Glass Development Kit in November 2013, translation capabilities of Word Lens were also demonstrated on Google Glass. According to the January 2014 New York Times article, Word Lens was free for Google Glass.\n\nGoogle, Inc. acquired Quest Visual on May 16, 2014 in order to incorporate Word Lens into its Google Translate service. As a result, all Word Lens language packs were available free of charge until January 2015. The details of the acquisition have not been released. Word Lens feature was incorporated into the Google Translate app and released on January 14, 2015.\n\nWord Lens is an augmented reality application that recognizes printed words using its optical character recognition capabilities and instantly translates these words into the desired language. This application does not require connection to the internet. In its default mode, Word Lens performs real-time translation, but can be paused to display a single frame or to look up alternative translations of each specific word in that frame. It is also possible to use the built-in dictionary to manually type in words that need to be translated.\n\n\"Word Lens 1.0\" was released on December 16, 2010, and received significant amount of attention soon after, including Wired, The Economist, CNN, The New York Times, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, MIT Technology Review, and ~2.5 million views on YouTube in the first 6 days. Since the application held a No. 1 position on the lists of \"Top Free Apps\" and \"Top Grossing Apps\" on iTunes for the few days following its release, it is currently described as \"Top In App Purchases\". In 2014, Word Lens was featured in the Apple ad for iPhone 5S \"Powerful\". This application is currently available as \"Word Lens 2.2.3\".\n\nWord Lens requires iPhone 3GS+, iPod Touch with a video camera, iPad 2+, or any iPad Mini . In 2012, Word Lens was released for a selection of Android smartphones. In 2013, Word Lens became available for Google Glass, even though Google Glass itself is not yet freely available.\n\nAt the release, only English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English were supported, but other language dictionaries were planned, with European languages expected first. English-to-French and French-to-English were released on December 14, 2011. In 2012, English-to-Italian and Italian-to-English were added, followed by English-to-German / German-to-English and English-to-Portuguese / Portuguese-to-English in 2013, and English-to-Russian / Russian-to-English in 2014.\n\nSince the acquisition by Google in May 2014, all previously released language packs can be downloaded for free. It was also speculated that through incorporation into Google Translate, Word Lens would be extended to \"broad language coverage and translation capabilities in the future\".\n\nAccording to its description, Word Lens is best used on clearly printed text and was not designed to translate handwritten or stylized fonts. This application was created to help tourists understand signs and menus, and it is not 100% accurate. The developer Otavio Good commented: \"I will be the first to say that it’s not perfect, but perfect was not the goal\". However, testers who took the app to other countries said it had been useful. Further, even though the application was not designed to read books, the Wall Street Journal journalist Ben Rooney managed to understand a page from \"Harry Potter y el Prisionero de Azkaban\".\n\nWord Lens has been developed by Otavio Good, a former video game developer and the founder of Quest Visual, John DeWeese, who previously worked on the Electronic Arts game \"Spore\", and programmers Maia Good, Bryan Lin, and Eric Park.\n\n\"Google Goggles application for Android and iPhone has the capability to translate text or identify objects in an image, but it requires users to take a picture with their phones, and an active internet connection. Word Lens does it on the fly, meaning it's interpreting frames in video, almost in real time. A similar app called LookTel, designed to help blind people, scans print on objects such as packages of food and reads them aloud.\"\n\nArticles in the \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"Tom's Guide\" cited Clarke's third law describing Word Lens: \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" journalist David Pogue included Word Lens in his list of \"the best tech ideas of the year\" 2010 (10 ideas total). See 2010 Pogie Awards video.\n\nIn the \"Wall Street Journal\" article by Ben Rooney, Word Lens received a rating of 4/5 and was described as \"a sort of magic\".\n\nWord Lens was chosen as a finalist for the 2010 Crunchies Best Technology Achievement award.\n\nEllen of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" demo'ed Word Lens and referred to it as 'amazing' in her segment Ellen Found the Best Apps!\n\nOtavio Good won the 2012 Netexplo award in the category \"Innovation & Technology\" presented at the UNESCO headquarters for the creation of Word Lens.\n\n\"The New York Times\" App Smart columnist Kit Eaton included Word Lens into his list of favorite apps.\n\n\"Table updated on April 23, 2014 based on refs.\"\n\n\n"}
