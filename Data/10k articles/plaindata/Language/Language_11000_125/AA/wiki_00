{"id": "17065775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17065775", "title": "Asset protection", "text": "Asset protection\n\nAsset protection (sometimes also referred to as \"debtor-creditor law\") is a set of legal techniques and a body of statutory and common law dealing with protecting assets of individuals and business entities from civil money judgments. The goal of asset protection planning is to insulate assets from claims of creditors without perjury or tax evasion.\n\nAsset protection consists of methods available to protect assets from liabilities arising elsewhere. It should not be confused with \"limiting liability\", which concerns the ability to stop or constrain liability to the asset or activity from which it arises. Assets that are shielded from creditors by law are few (common examples include some home equity, certain retirement plans and interests in LLCs and limited partnerships [and even these are not always unreachable]). Assets that are almost always unreachable are those to which one does not hold legal title. In many cases it is possible to vest legal title to personal assets in a trust, an agent or a nominee, while retaining all the control of the assets. The goal of asset protection is similar to bankruptcy, and the two practice areas go hand-in-hand. When a debtor has none to few assets, the bankruptcy route is preferable. When the debtor has significant assets, asset protection may be the solution.\n\nThe four threshold factors that are either expressly or implicitly analyzed in each asset protection case are:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst the aforementioned use of Trusts will be of benefit in a number of cases the question of ownership can still arise, as although legal ownership may have been transferred to the trustees, beneficial ownership may still in many cases lie with the settler of the Trust. A Private Placement Life Insurance contract (PPLI), can provide a greater degree of protection and privacy than most Trusts, and can also be integrated with an existing trust if necessary. Whilst Trusts may not be recognised in many Jurisdictions, Life insurance also has the advantage of being Multi jurisdictional.\n\nUnited States federal bankruptcy laws and ERISA laws exempt certain assets from creditors, including certain retirement plans. All fifty states also have laws that exempt certain assets from creditors. These vary from state to state, but they often include exemptions for a certain amount of equity in a personal residence, individual retirement accounts, clothing, or other personal property.\n\nAll fifty U.S. states also have laws that protect the owners of a corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company from the liabilities of the entity. Many states limit the remedies of a creditor of a limited partner or a member in an LLC, thereby providing some protection for the assets of the entity from the creditors of a member.\n\nAll fifty U.S. states provide some protection for the assets of a trust against the creditors of the beneficiaries. Some states allow asset protection for a self-settled trust (a trust in which the settlor or creator of the trust is included as a potential discretionary beneficiary) and some states do not.\n\nCreditors have several tools to overcome the laws that provide asset protection. First, there are federal and state fraudulent transfer laws. Today there are two bodies of fraudulent transfer law: the Bankruptcy Code and state fraudulent transfer statutes. Most states have adopted Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act which defines what constitutes a fraudulent transfer. The UFTA and the Bankruptcy Code both provide that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer with the \"actual intention to hinder, delay or defraud\" any creditor of the debtor. While UFTA applies clearly to present creditors, the distinction between a future creditor and a future potential creditor is not as clear. The UFTA is commonly held to apply only to future creditors and not to future potential creditors (those whose claim arises after the transfer, but there was no foreseeable connection between the creditor and the debtor at the time of the transfer).\n\nThere are also laws which allow a creditor to pierce the corporate veil of an entity and go after the owners for the debts of the entity. It may also be possible for a creditor of a member to reach the assets of an entity through a constructive trust claim, or a claim for a reverse piercing of a corporate veil.\n\nThe anti-alienation provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) exempts from claims of creditors the assets of pension, profit-sharing, or 401(k) plans. Two exceptions are carved out for qualified domestic relations orders and claims under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990. Because the protection is set forth in a federal statute, it will trump any state fraudulent transfer law. Protection of ERISA is afforded to employees only and does not cover employers. The owner of a business is treated as an employer, even though he may also be the employee of the same business, as in a closely held corporation. Accordingly, ERISA protection does not apply to sole proprietors, to one owner business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, and to partnerships, unless the plan covers employees other than the owners, partners and their spouses.\n\nAsset protection planning requires a working knowledge of federal and state exemption laws, federal and state bankruptcy laws, federal and state tax laws, the comparative laws of many jurisdictions (onshore and offshore), choice of law principles, in addition to the laws of trusts, estates, corporations and business entities. The process of asset protection planning involves assessing the facts, circumstances, and objectives of an individual, evaluating the pros and cons of the various options, designing a structure that is most likely to accomplish all the objectives of the individual (including asset protection objectives), preparing legal documents to carry out the plan, and ensuring that the various legal entities are operated properly in accordance with the laws and the objectives of the individual. This process involves providing legal advice and legal work and most states prohibit the practice of law without a license.\n\nAsset protection planning began to develop as a stand-alone area of the law in the late 1970s. It began coming into prominence in the late 1980s, with the advent and the marketing of offshore asset protection trusts. Colorado attorney Barry Engel is credited with the introduction of that concept and the development of asset protection trust law statutes in the Cook Islands. The most distinctive feature of the offshore trust is the fact that the settlor or creator of the trust may be included among the potential beneficiaries of the trust without causing the assets of the trust to be subject to the creditors of the settlor. This is often referred to as a \"self-settled trust.\"\n\nOver the years, this new field of law enjoyed a marginal reputation, but started going mainstream in the mid-1990s. A 2003 article in the Wall Street Journal claimed that 60% of America's millionaires have considered engaging in asset protection planning.\n\nChoice of law rules in the United States make it possible for a person from any state to create a trust, corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company that is governed by the laws of any other state or jurisdiction. Because of this ability to \"forum shop,\" various states and other jurisdictions have modified their laws to allow greater asset protection in order to make them competitive with other jurisdictions.\n\nIn most states, the assets of a self-settled trust are not protected from the creditors of the settlor. In 1997, the State of Alaska passed a statute which provided that the assets of an Alaska self-settled trust are not subject to the creditors of the settlor. Since 1997, the following states have adopted legislation allowing for a self-settled asset protection trust: Nevada, Delaware, South Dakota, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Oklahoma, Colorado, Missouri, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. This legislation created a favorable offshore asset protection trust jurisdiction also for non-US settlors.\n\nThere is considerable debate about the comparative effectiveness of the asset protection provided by the laws of each jurisdiction, onshore and offshore. Similarly, the asset protection features provided by corporations, limited partnerships and limited liability companies vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Once again, Alaska's limited liability company statute provides innovative advantages over other states. Case law from North Carolina demonstrates the asset protection advantages of a transfer to a limited liability company (see Herring v. Keasler, 150 NC App 598 (01-1000) 06/04/2002).\n\nJust as the Cook Islands have developed a reputation for the best offshore jurisdiction for an asset protection trust, Nevis stands out in the competition for the best jurisdiction to file a limited liability company. The Nevis limited liability company statute is based on the Delaware limited liability statute, but they have a few added advantages. One advantage of a Nevis LLC is that the members and managers are not disclosed to the public.\n\nThere is some debate over the ethics of asset protection planning. On one hand, every attorney that creates a trust, corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company is engaging in some form of asset protection planning. On the other hand, most would agree that it is ethically inappropriate to assist a person to commit fraud or evade income taxes. The timing and the purposes of the plan seem to be the determinative factors as to whether a plan will be considered ethically and legally appropriate. In some cases, individuals have gone to jail for contempt of court for failing to unwind a plan that a judge felt was repugnant to the principles of law and justice, however in those cases the individuals incarcerated retained some control over their plan immediately prior to, or during, litigation.\n\n"}
{"id": "314090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314090", "title": "Bass-baritone", "text": "Bass-baritone\n\nA bass-baritone is a high-lying bass or low-lying \"classical\" baritone voice type which shares certain qualities with the true baritone voice. The term arose in the late 19th century to describe the particular type of voice required to sing three Wagnerian roles: the Dutchman in \"Der fliegende Holländer\", Wotan/Der Wanderer in the \"Ring Cycle\" and Hans Sachs in \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\". Wagner labelled these roles as \"Hoher Bass\" (\"high bass\")—see fach for more details.\n\nThe bass-baritone voice is distinguished by two attributes. First, it must be capable of singing comfortably in a baritonal tessitura. Secondly, however, it needs to have the ripely resonant lower range typically associated with the bass voice. For example, the role of Wotan in \"Die Walküre\" covers the range from F (the F at the bottom of the bass clef) to F (the F above middle C), but only infrequently descends beyond C (the C below middle C). Bass-baritones are typically divided into two separate categories: lyric bass-baritone and dramatic bass-baritone.\n\nBass-baritones should not be confused with their vocal cousin—the so-called Verdi baritone. This type of Italianate baritone voice has a brighter tone colour and sings at a slightly higher tessitura than that possessed by the bass-baritone. In addition to the operas of Giuseppe Verdi, its natural home is to be found in operatic music composed after about 1830 by the likes of Donizetti, Ponchielli, Massenet, Puccini and the verismo composers.\n\nThe term bass-baritone is roughly synonymous with the Italian vocal classification basso cantante; for example, in the Verdian repertoire, Philip II in \"Don Carlos\" is often taken by a bass-baritone, while Ferrando in \"Il trovatore\" is sung by a true bass—though the two roles' ranges are very similar. In Debussy's \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" the lower baritone role of Golaud is a bass-baritone, sitting between Pelleas (high baritone) and Arkel (bass). (See under fach for more information.) Much of the oratorio repertoire, from Handel's \"Messiah\" to Mendelssohn's \"Elijah\", is best suited to a bass-baritone with the ability to combine a rich, dark tone with a smooth, high-lying cantabile line. Some of the classical Mozart baritone roles such as Don Giovanni, Figaro and Gugliemo—composed before the term \"baritone\" gained currency—are occasionally played by a bass-baritone.\n\nGilbert and Sullivan's Savoy operas usually featured a comic bass-baritone character, created to make use of D'Oyly Carte company member Richard Temple.\n\nIn short: the \"bass-baritone\" is a voice that has the resonant low notes of the typical bass allied with the ability to sing in a baritonal tessitura. Colloquially, it refers to a voice with a range and tone somewhere between a bass and a baritone.\n\nThe bass-baritone's required range can vary tremendously based on the role, with some less demanding than others. Many bass-baritones have ventured into the baritone repertoire, including (among others) Leopold Demuth, George Baklanov, Rudolf Bockelmann, George London, James Morris and Bryn Terfel.\n\nThe following operatic parts are performed by bass-baritones but sometimes by high basses:\n\nCore bass-baritone operatic parts:\n\n Bass-baritone parts in Gilbert and Sullivan works:\n\n\nOther bass-baritone parts:\n\n"}

It was informal ideology of the Italian Socialist Party from 1976 to 1994, the year of the end of the \"First Republic\" and of PSI, because of strong corruption scandals. \n\nThe Craxism, although the term derogatory today was based on a synthesis of social democracy, socialism and liberal conservatism. In fact, if on one side the PSI under Craxi is required with a strong third-worldism, Pro-Arabianism, environmentalism and a modern welfare state system (typical of the modern left), on the other hand was strongly pro-Atlanticist and pro-europeanist and supported privatisations, liberalisations and placed on a strong defense of territorial sovereignty (e.g. \"Sigonella crisis\" American armed forces) and on conservative policies on issues such as abortion and war on drugs.\n\nUnder Craxi, PSI moved from left-wing (close to PCI) to centre-left, almost centrist, much to ally with the Christian Democracy and other moderate parties that formed a coalition called \"Pentapartito\", which ensured a stable majority to govern.\n\nToday, the Craxism is often used in derogatory form to define a corrupt politician, although some welcome him in a favourable manner: this is the case of those who, following the dissolution of the PSI, joined the newly formed Forza Italia of Silvio Berlusconi (centre-right), but also a part of those who formed the Italian Socialists, small party adhering to the Alliance of progressives of Achille Occhetto (centre-left).\n\nFinally, the Craxism has led to the change of the entire European socialism, together with Felipe González (PSOE), François Mitterrand (PS) and Helmut Schmidt (SPD), during all the years 80; In addition, along with these other figures, inspired the overhaul and the policies of Tony Blair's Labour Party, the José Zapatero's PSOE and the Andreas Papandreou's PASOK.\n\nIn Italy, the main critics of the Craxism (as well as the figure of Craxi), are the former Communists (including most members of the Democratic Party) and some media left-wing press (Il Fatto Quotidiano, il manifesto, L'Espresso, La Repubblica, etc.), while the biggest supporters are the PSI of Riccardo Nencini and various politicians of The People of Freedom and the centre-right, as Silvio Berlusconi (also ex-Socialist), Renato Brunetta, Maurizio Sacconi, Stefano Caldoro and Stefania Craxi, Bettino's daughter.\n\nAbroad, Bettino Craxi has received praise especially by Mário Soares, Ricardo Lagos, Felipe González, Lech Walesa, Ronald Reagan, Sergio Romano (Italian Ambassador in the USA), Renato Ruggiero (Socialist diplomat and former Director of the WTO), Boris Biancheri.\n"}
{"id": "30722649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30722649", "title": "Declamation", "text": "Declamation\n\nDeclamation (from the Latin: declamatio for \"declaration\") is an artistic form of public speaking. It is a dramatic oration designed to present through articulation, emphasis and gesture the full sense of the message being imparted.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, declamation was a genre of ancient rhetoric and a mainstay of the Roman higher education system. It was separated into two component subgenres, the \"controversia\", speeches of defense or prosecution in fictitious court cases, and the \"suasoria\", in which the speaker advised a historical or legendary figure as to a course of action. Roman declamations survive in four corpora: the compilations of Seneca the Elder and Calpurnius Flaccus, as well as two sets of \"controversiae\", the \"Major Declamations\" and \"Minor Declamations\" spuriously attributed to Quintilian.\n\nDeclamation had its origin in the form of preliminary exercises for Greek students of rhetoric: works from the Greek declamatory tradition survive in works such as the collections of Sopater and Choricius of Gaza. Of the remaining Roman declamations the vast majority are \"controversiae\"; only one book of \"suasoriae\" survive, that being in Seneca the Elder's collection. The \"controversia\" as they currently exist normally consist of several elements: an imaginary law, a theme which introduced a tricky legal situation, and an argument which records a successful or model speech on the topic. It was normal for students to employ illustrative \"exempla\" from Roman history and legend (such as were collected in the work of Valerius Maximus) to support their case. Important points were often summed up via pithy epigrammatic statements (\"sententiae\"). Common themes include ties of fidelity between fathers and sons, heroes and tyrants in the archaic city, and conflicts between rich and poor men.\n\nAs a critical part of rhetorical education, declamation's influence was widespread in Roman elite culture. In addition to its didactic role, it is also attested as a performative genre: public declamations were visited by such figures as Pliny the Elder, Asinius Pollio, Maecenas, and the emperor Augustus. The poet Ovid is recorded by Seneca the Elder as being a star declaimer, and the works of the satirists Martial and Juvenal, as well as the historian Tacitus, reveal a substantial declamatory influence.\n\nLater examples of declamation can be seen in the work of the sixth century AD bishop and author Ennodius.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, a classical revival of the art of public speaking, often referred to as The Elocution Movement occurred in Britain. While elocution focused on the voice—articulation, diction, and pronunciation—declamation focused on delivery. Rather than a narrow focus on rhetoric, or persuasion, practitioners involved in the movement focused on improving speech and gesture to convey the full sentiment of the message. Traditionally, practitioners of declamation served in the clergy, legislature or law, but by the nineteenth century, the practice had extended to theatrical and reformist venues. Initially, the aim was to improve the standard of oral communication, as high rates of illiteracy made it imperative for churches, courts and parliaments, to rely on the spoken word. Through modification of inflection and phrasing, along with appropriate gestures, speakers were taught to convey the meaning and persuade the audience, rather than deliver monotonous litanies. \n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, reformers were using the \"art of declamation\" to publicly address vice and provide moral guidance. In the Americas, missionary-run schools focused on teaching former slaves the art of public speaking to enable them to elevate others of their race as teachers and ministers. Using drama as a tool to teach, reformers hoped to standardize the spoken word, while creating a sense of national pride. Studies and presentation of declamation flourished in Latin America and particularly in the African-American and Afro-Caribbean communities through the first third of the twentieth century. Practitioners attempted to interpret their orations to convey the emotions and feeling behind the writer's words to the audience, rather than simply recite them. In the twentieth century, among black practitioners, topical focus often was on the irony of their lives in a post-slavery world, recognizing that they had gained freedom but were not free to express themselves. Presentation involved utilization of African rhythms from dance and music, and local dialect, as a form of social protest.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9074803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9074803", "title": "Determiner", "text": "Determiner\n\nA determiner, also called determinative (abbreviated ), is a word, phrase, or affix that occurs together with a noun or noun phrase and serves to express the reference of that noun or noun phrase in the context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Common kinds of determiners include definite and indefinite articles (like the English \"the\" and \"a\" or \"an\"), demonstratives (\"this\" and \"that\"), possessive determiners (\"my\" and \"their\"), quantifiers (\"many\", \"few\" and \"several\"), numerals, distributive determiners (\"each\", \"any\"), and interrogative determiners (\"which\").\n\nFor examples of determiners and use, see the box on the use in English, English determiners\n\nMost determiners have been traditionally classed along with either adjectives or pronouns, and this still occurs in classical grammars: for example, demonstrative and possessive determiners are sometimes described as \"demonstrative adjectives\" and \"possessive adjectives\" or as \"(adjectival) demonstrative pronouns\" and \"(adjectival) possessive pronouns\" respectively. These classical interpretations of determiners map to some of the linguistic properties related to determiners in modern syntax theories, such as deictic information, definiteness and genitivity. However, modern theorists of grammar prefer to distinguish determiners as a separate word class from adjectives, which are simple modifiers of nouns, expressing attributes of the thing referred to. This distinction applies particularly in languages like English that use definite and indefinite articles, frequently as a necessary component of noun phrases – the determiners may then be taken to be a class of words that includes the articles as well as other words that function in the place of articles. (The composition of this class may depend on the particular language's rules of syntax; for example, in English the possessives \"my\", \"your\" etc. are used without articles and so can be regarded as determiners, whereas their Italian equivalents \"\" etc. are used together with articles and so may be better classed as adjectives.) Not all languages can be said to have a lexically distinct class of determiners.\n\nIn some languages, the role of certain determiners can be played by affixes (prefixes or suffixes) attached to a noun or by other types of inflection. For example, definite articles are represented by suffixes in Romanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Swedish. (For example, in Swedish, ' (\"book\"), when definite, becomes ' (\"the book\"), while the Romanian \"\" (\"notebook\") similarly becomes \"caietul\" (\"the notebook\").) Some languages, such as Finnish, have possessive affixes, which play the role of possessive determiners like \"my\" and \"his\".\nSome theoreticians unify determiners and pronouns into a single class. For further information, see .\n\nUniversal Grammar is the theory that all humans are born equipped with grammar, and all languages share certain properties. There are arguments that determiners are not a part of Universal Grammar and are instead part of an emergent syntactic category. This has been shown through the studies of some languages' histories, including Dutch.\nDeterminers may be subcategorized as predeterminers, central determiners and postdeterminers, based on the order in which they can occur. For example, \"all my seventeen very young children\" uses one of each. \"My all seventeen very young children\" is ungrammatical because a central determiner cannot precede a predeterminer.\n\nAn article is a word that is used with a noun (as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. Some example of articles are \"a\", \"an\", \"the\".\n\nDemonstratives are words, such as \"this\" and \"that\", used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others. They are usually deictic, which means their meaning changes with context.\n\nPossessive determiners modify a noun by attributing possession (or other sense of belonging) to someone or something, and usually reflect the noun's genitive case. They are also known as possessive adjectives.\n\nQuantifiers indicate quantity. Some examples of quantifiers include: \"all\", \"some\", \"many\", \"few\", and \"no\". Quantifiers are also dependent of a noun. It is important to acknowledge that quantifiers only indicate a vague quantity of objects, not a specific number, such as \"twelve\", \"dozen\", \"first\", \"single\", or \"once\", which would be considered numerals.\n\nDistributive determiners, also called distributive adjectives, consider members of a group separately, rather than collectively. Words such as \"each\", \"any\", \"either\", and \"neither\" are examples of distributive determiners. This type of determiner also depends on a noun. These determiners are not to be confused with distributive pronouns, which can operate without a noun.\n\n\nInterrogatives are used to ask a question, such as \"which\", \"what\", and \"whose\" (personal possessive determiner). These determiners also depend on a noun.\n\nSome modern grammatical approaches regard determiners (rather than nouns) as the head of their phrase and thus refer to such phrases as determiner phrases rather than noun phrases. Under this assumption, every noun in a syntax tree is dominated by a determiner. There are many examples in natural language where nouns appear without a determiner, yet in determiner phrase grammars there must still be a determiner. To account for this, syntacticians consider the head of the determiner phrase to be an unpronounced null determiner. These grammar theories are either based on X-bar theory or descend from it, which requires that every noun has a corresponding determiner (or specifier). In the cases where a noun does not have an explicit determiner (as in \"physics uses mathematics\"), X-bar theory hypothesizes the presence of a zero article, or zero determiner, an X-bar specific form of the null determiner. Noun phrases that contain only a noun and do not have a determiner present are known as bare noun phrases. For more detail on theoretical approaches to the status of determiners, see .\n\nUnder the Universal Grammar theory, most facets of language are inherent, and only idiosyncrasies of languages are learned. Notice that determiners and subsequently their phrases would have to inherently be part of Universal Grammar in order for Determiner Phrase theory and Universal Grammar theory to coexist.\n\nSome theoreticians unify determiners and pronouns into a single class. See Pronoun: Theoretical considerations. This is consistent with the determiner phrase viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the head of the phrase.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3199912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3199912", "title": "Downstep", "text": "Downstep\n\nDownstep is a phenomenon in tone languages in which if two syllables have the same tone (for example, both with a high tone or both with a low tone), the second syllable is lower in pitch than the first.\n\nTwo main kinds of downstep can be distinguished. The first, more usually called automatic downstep, downdrift or catathesis, occurs when high and low tones come in the sequence H L (L) H; the second high tone tends to be lower than the first because of the intervening low toned syllable. That phenomenon is common in African languages, such as Chichewa. It has also been argued that the same phenomenon causes English sentences, such as \"I really believe Ebenezer was a dealer in magnesium\" or \"I bought blueberries, bayberries, raspberries, mulberries, and brambleberries\" (if the sentences are pronounced with a falling intonation), to fall gradually in pitch, with each accented syllable (here underlined) slightly lower than the last.\n\nDownstep proper, or non-automatic downstep, is another phenomenon found especially in West African languages such as Igbo. If two high tones are in succeeding syllables (thus in the sequence H H), the second is lower than the first. In such languages, when two high tones come one after the other, they are at the same height or, if there is a downstep, the second one is lower. The second high tone is also lower than the preceding one if there is an intervening low tone in the sequence H L H as described above. The high tones in a simple sentence tend to descend from the beginning to the end of the sentence in a series of steps, a phenomenon that Is known as tone terracing.\n\nThe symbol for the second kind of downstep in the International Phonetic Alphabet is a superscript down arrow, . It is common to see instead a superscript exclamation mark because of typographic constraints. \n\nIt has been shown that in most, if not all, cases of downstep proper, the lowering of the second high tone is from an intervening low-toned syllable that has dropped out. What was H L H has become H H. The missing low-toned syllable creates what is known as a 'floating tone'. An example occurs in Bambara, a language spoken in Mali. Its definite article is a floating low tone. With a noun in isolation, it docks to the preceding vowel and turns a high tone into a falling tone:\n\nHowever, when it occurs between two high tones, it downsteps the following tone:\n\n"}

He attended \"liceu\", or high school, in Portuguese before undergoing his teacher training. He contributed short stories in Portuguese to newspapers such as \"Diário de Goa\" and \"O Heraldo\" from the 1950s to the 1980s. He also participated in the Portuguese-language programme \"Renascença\", which ran on All-India Radio until the 1980s. For José Pereira, Pais was \"one of Goa’s prominent writers of fiction in Portuguese\". For Manuel de Seabra and Vimala Devi, Pais was a writer who felt the world around him in all his poetry and tragedy and whose writing was reminiscent of Russian writers like Turgenev and Korolenko.\n\nA collection of Pais's stories was published in Lisbon in 1973 by Editorial Futura under the title \"Os Javalis de Codval\".\n\nSeveral key themes recur in the short narratives contained. One subject is matrimony, a particularly prevalent topos in Lusophone Goan writing for the discussion of caste identities and social mores. In stories such as “Ferdinando,” “De Mal a Pior” or “Um Diário e Duas Cartas” these perennial machinations are depicted within the context of a society undergoing deep social shifts that render these compacts even more fraught. Another subset of tales focuses on the breakdown of traditional rural society, featuring Hindu characters in the main and striking a similar tone to Pundalik Naik’s Konkani-language novel \"Upheaval\", perhaps the most prominent Goan novel to deal with this subject. These stories include “Uma Filha da Terra” and “Munu.” The third subgroup is represented by “Os javalis de Codval,” “O navio encalhado,” “História de minas,” “Outra história de minas” and “No comboio.” All of these narratives involve in some way a journey out into uncertainty, a setting forth in search of wealth, security or merely sustenance that ends in some sort of reversal. Both the journeys and the conditions under which they are undertaken resonate with the social, economic and political changes occurring in Goa at the time in which the stories are set.\n\nAt his death, Pais left behind a dozen uncollected stories. It is unclear whether they had been broadcast or published in the written press in some form. These stories extend Pais's concerns beyond 1973.\n\nIn 2003, the story \"Um Portuguese em Baga\" (A Portuguese in Baga) was published in the Portuguese-Language anthology of Goan writing \"Onde O Moruoni Canta\", which deals subtly with questions of identity in a post-colonial Goa.\n\nPais left behind an unpublished novel in Portuguese. It will be published by Goa, 1556 under the title \"Preia-Mar\" in 2016. The novel follows the trajectory of a young Goan named Leo. From a privileged yet impoverished family, Leo tries to strike it rich by any means possible in the Goa of the 1970s. Moving through various strata representative of the society of his times – new ascendant classes linked to smuggling, mining and politics, hippies tired of the West in search of drugs and spirituality, the fishermen of the coast and repatriates from Idi Amin’s Uganda, the novel reaches a climax that defies local tradition even as it calls into question the principles of the new order.\n\n\n\nOther translations into English appear in: \n"}
{"id": "11675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11675", "title": "False friend", "text": "False friend\n\nFalse friends are words in two languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning. An example is the English \"embarrassed\" and the Spanish \"embarazada\" (which means \"pregnant\"), or the word \"sensible\", which means \"reasonable\" in English, but \"sensitive\" in French and Spanish. \n\nThe term originates from a book by French linguists describing the phenomenon, which was translated in 1928 and entitled, \"false friend of a translator\".\n\nThere is often a partial overlap in meanings, which creates additional complications.\n\nAs well as producing completely false friends, the use of loanwords often results in the use of a word in a restricted context, which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language. For example, \"angst\" means \"fear\" in a general sense (as well as \"anxiety\") in German, but when it was borrowed into English in the context of psychology, its meaning was restricted to a particular type of fear described as \"a neurotic feeling of anxiety and depression\". Also, \"gymnasium\" meant both 'a place of education' and 'a place for exercise' in Latin, but its meaning was restricted to the former in German and to the latter in English, making the expressions into false friends in those languages as well as in Greek, where it started out as 'a place for naked exercise'.\n\nFalse friends, or bilingual homophones are words in two or more languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning.\n\nThe origin of the term is as a shortened version of the expression \"false friend of a translator\", the English translation of a French expression () introduced by linguists Maxime Kœssler and Jules Derocquigny in their 1928 book, \"False Friends, or the Pitfalls of the English Vocabulary\" (\"Les Faux Amis ou les trahisons du vocabulaire anglais\") with a sequel, \"Autres Mots anglais perfides\".\n\nFalse friends can cause difficulty for people who might interpret a foreign text incorrectly. Students learning a foreign language, particularly one that is related to their native language, also have difficulty with false friends because students are likely to identify the words wrongly due to linguistic interference. For this reason, teachers sometimes compile lists of false friends as an aid for their students.\n\nFrom the etymological point of view, false friends can be created in several ways.\n\nIf language A borrowed a word from language B, or both borrowed the word from a third language or inherited it from a common ancestor, and later the word shifted in meaning or acquired additional meanings in at least one of these languages, a native speaker of one language will face a false friend when learning the other. Sometimes, presumably both senses were present in the common ancestor language, but the cognate words got different restricted senses in Language A and Language B.\n\n\"Actual\", which in English is usually a synonym of \"real\", has a different meaning in other European languages, in which it means 'current' or 'up-to-date', and has the logical derivative as a verb, meaning 'to make current' or 'to update'. \"Actualise\" (or 'actualize') in English means 'to make a reality of'.\n\nThe word \"friend\" itself has cognates in the other Germanic languages; but the Scandinavian ones (like Swedish \"frände\", Danish \"frænde\") predominantly mean 'relative'. The original Proto-Germanic word meant simply 'someone whom one cares for' and could therefore refer to both a friend and a relative, but lost various degrees of the 'friend' sense in Scandinavian languages, while it mostly lost the sense of 'relative' in English. (The plural \"friends\" is still rarely used for \"kinsfolk\", as in the Scottish proverb \"Friends agree best at a distance\", quoted in 1721.)\n\nThe Estonian and Finnish languages are closely related, which gives rise to false friends:\nOr Estonian \"vaimu\" (spirit; ghost) and Finnish \"vaimo\" (wife), ; or Estonian \"huvitav\" (interesting) and Finnish \"huvittava\" (amusing).\n\nA high level of lexical similarity exists between German and Dutch, but shifts in meaning of words with a shared etymology have in some instances resulted in 'bi-directional false friends':\n\nThe Italian word \"confetti\" (sugared almonds) has acquired a new meaning in English, French and Dutch; in Italian, the corresponding word is \"coriandoli\".\n\nEnglish and Spanish, both of which have borrowed from Greek and Latin, have multiple false friends.\n\nEnglish and Japanese also have diverse false friends, many of them being \"wasei-eigo\" and \"gairaigo\" words.\n\nIn Swedish, the word \"rolig\" means 'fun': \"ett roligt skämt\" (\"a funny joke\"), while in the closely related languages Danish and Norwegian it means 'calm' (as in \"he was calm despite all the commotion around him\"). However, the Swedish original meaning of 'calm' is retained in some related words such as \"ro\", 'calmness', and \"orolig\", 'worrisome, anxious', literally 'un-calm'. The Danish and Norwegian word \"semester\" means term (as in school term), but the Swedish word \"semester\" means holiday. The Danish word \"frokost\" means lunch, the Norwegian word \"frokost\" means breakfast.\n\nPseudo-anglicisms are new words formed from English morphemes independently from an analogous English construct and with a different intended meaning.\n\nJapanese is replete with pseudo-anglicisms, known as \"wasei-eigo\" (\"Japan-made English\").\n\nIn bilingual situations, false friends often result in a semantic change—a real new meaning that is then commonly used in a language. For example, the Portuguese \"humoroso\" ('capricious') changed its referent in American Portuguese to 'humorous', owing to the English surface-cognate \"humorous.\"\n\n\"Corn\" was originally the dominant type of grain in a region (indeed \"corn\" and \"grain\" are themselves cognates from the same Indo-European root). It came to mean usually cereals in general in the British Isles in the nineteenth century, as in the Corn Laws, but maize in North America, and now often just maize also in the British Isles.\n\nThe American Italian \"fattoria\" lost its original meaning 'farm' in favor of 'factory' owing to the phonetically similar surface-cognate English \"factory\" (cf. Standard Italian \"fabbrica\" 'factory'). Instead of the original \"fattoria\", the phonetic adaptation American Italian \"farma\" became the new signifier for 'farm' (Weinreich 1963: 49; see \"one-to-one correlation between signifiers and referents\").\n\nThis phenomenon is analyzed by Ghil'ad Zuckermann as \"(incestuous) phono-semantic matching\".\n\n\n"}

Members have included Francis Édeline, Jean-Marie Klinkenberg, Jacques Dubois, Francis Pire, Hadelin Trinon and Philippe Minguet, with several other associate members. Beyond their personal research in biochemistry, cultural sociology, aesthetics, or semiotics, the authors have published collectively various books as well as more than sixty papers in such journals as \"Communications\", \"Poétique\", \"Versus\", \"Visio\", \"Degrés\", \"Cahiers internationaux de symbolisme\", \"Communication et langage\", \"Era\", \"Revue d'esthétique\", \"Le Français moderne\", \"Texte\", \"Technê\", \"Protée\", \"RS/SI\", \"Nouveaux actes sémiotiques\", \"Les Documents de travail d'Urbino\", etc. or in collected papers. \n\nSome of their early work in the 1960s dealt with linguistically oriented topics such as polysemous language, and the nature of synecdoche and metaphor. The concepts elaborated in the group’s first major publication (\"A General Rhetoric\" 1970) contributed to the revival of rhetorics at the time, by providing an explanatory model of rhetorical figures, which drew on contemporary concepts of linguistic structure. The group separated itself even further from formal structuralism with the publication of \"A Rhetoric of Poetry\" (1977), which showed that, although the presence of certain linguistic structures – and foremost amongst them poly-isotopy, made possible by rhetorical figures – was a necessary condition for the production of poetic effects, this condition was not enough, and that anthropological and social criteria would be needed to complete these structures.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s they worked on developing a theoretical approach towards visual rhetoric and visual semiotics that involved classifying images according to their differences from plastic and iconic norms.\n\nThe \"Traité du signe visuel\" (1992) (which Göran Sonesson said was to visual communication what Saussure's \"Cours de linguistique générale\" was to linguistics) sought to elaborate a general grammar of the image, independently of the type of corpus being considered. This semiotic of the visual contributed, in its turn, to semiotics in general: indeed, a question encountered by the group at this stage was that of the relationship between sensorial experience and signification, a question which certainly reveals something of this degree of generality since it comes up against the question of the origin of meaning itself.\n\nThe group took its name from the metaphor, μ being the Greek initial for the term.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2340297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340297", "title": "Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas", "text": "Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas\n\nGuillaume de Saluste Du Bartas (1544, MonfortJuly 1590, Mauvezin) was a Gascon Huguenot courtier and poet. Trained as a doctor of law, he served in the court of Henri de Navarre for most of his career. Du Bartas was celebrated across sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe for his divine poetry, particularly \"L'Uranie \"(1584), \"Judit \"(1584), \"La Sepmaine; ou, Creation du monde\" (1578), and \"La Seconde Semaine\" (1584-1603).\nRelatively little is known about Du Bartas’ life. Born in 1544, Guillaume Sallustre descended from a family of wealthy merchants in Montfort (in the Armagnac region). His family name later became ‘Saluste’ rather than 'Sallustre', perhaps to invite comparison with the Roman historian Sallust. He was possibly a student at College de Guyenne in Bordeaux (Michel de Montaigne’s school), and studied law in Toulouse under Jacques Cujas: he became a doctor of law in 1567, and subsequently a judge in Montfort in 1571. He gained the lordship of nearby Bartas (becoming Sieur Du Bartas) on his father’s death in 1566. He married Catherine de Manas, a local noblewoman, in 1570, and they had four daughters together: Anne, Jeanne, Marie and Isabeau.\n\nHe entered the service of Henri de Navarre in 1576, who would become Henri IV of France in 1589. He was sent on various diplomatic missions, including to Montmorency in 1580, and Scotland and England in 1587. He died in 1590, just weeks after composing a poem that celebrated Henri's victory at the Battle of Ivry, though it is not thought that he fought in the battle.\n\nChâteau Du Bartas, found in Saint Georges, was Du Bartas' residence in the later part of his life. A statue of Du Bartas stands in a square named after him in Auch, the historic capital of Gascony.\n\nDu Bartas began writing poetry in the 1560s after being invited to do so by Jeanne d'Albret de Navarre. His first collection, \"La muse chrestienne\" (1574) contains ‘L’Uranie’, a verse prosopographia in which the Christian muse urges the poet to commit himself to composing serious poetry on scriptural themes. The other two items in the volume, the biblical epic \"Judit\" and 'Le Triomphe de la Foi', were examples of this new religious verse.\n\nDu Bartas' masterpiece is his \"Semaines\" ('Weeks'), two epic poems which freely expand on the account in the Book of Genesis of the creation of the world and the first eras of world history. Each \"Semaine\" consists of individual \"jours\" (days) which can be read separately.\n\n\"La Semaine ou creation du Monde\" ('The Week, of creation of the World'), subsequently also known as \"La Premiere Sepmaine\" was first printed in Paris in 1578, and was immediately popular. \"La Sepmaine\" is a hexameral poem consisting of seven \"jours\", each containing around 700 lines, devoted to the aspect of the world created on that day in the first week. Because the poem's structure follows Genesis 1:1-8 closely, it is easy to navigate to particular sections; for example, readers wanting to find what Du Bartas writes about cuttlefish or mullet could know to turn to 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day) and in most editions would have had marginal annotations to help them locate the description of each creature.\n\n'Le Premier Jour' (The First Day) describes the creation of the world out of chaos (Du Bartas advocates the theory of creation \"ex nihilo\" - 'Nothing, but \"Nothing\" had the Lord Almighty, | Whereof, wherewith, whereby, to build this City' (Sylvester, I.i.228-29), forecasts the Day of Judgement and concludes with a discussion of angels. 'Le Second Jour' (The Second Day) concerns the creation of the four elements - water, air, earth and fire - and their meteorological effects. Land, seas and vegetation are created in 'Le Troisiesme Jour' (The Third Day). The earth is populated with particular species of natural life during the next three days: the sun, stars and seasons in 'Le Quatriesme Jour' (The Fourth Day); fish and birds in 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day); and land animals and human beings in 'Le Sixiesme Jour' (The Sixth Jour). In 'Le Septiesme Jour' (The Seventh Day) Gods surveys the world he has created, and the poet meditates on the created world.\n\nFollowing the success of his First Week, Du Bartas embarked upon a sequel that would survey world history from Adam to the apocalypse, following the plan in Augustine's \"City of God\". He only completed four \"jours\", each divided into four parts, that covered the eras of Adam, Noah, Abraham and David (the final three were to cover Zedekiah, the Messiah and the Eternal Sabbath).\n\nThe first two \"jours\" of \"La Seconde Semaine\" were first printed in 1584. 'Le Premier Jour' (the era of Adam) contains 'Eden' (II.i.1) describing the Garden of Paradise; 'L'Imposture' ('The Imposture' in Sylvester's translation, II.i.2) which relates the Fall of Man; 'Les Furies' ('The Furies', II.i.3) which describes the diseases, conflicts and vices that plague mankind; and 'Les Artifices' ('The Handy Crafts', II.i.4) which is about the various crafts that humankind learnt, and Cain and Abel. 'Le Second Jour' (Noah) consists of 'L'Arche' ('The Arke', II.ii.1) retelling the Great Flood; 'Babylone' ('Babylon', II.ii.2) about the Tower of Babel and European literary cultures; 'Les Colonies' ('The Colonies', Ii.ii.3) which describes the spread of different tribes across the world; and 'Les Colomnes' ('The Columnes', II.ii.4) in which the tale (originally found in Josephus) of Seth writing scientific and astronomical knowledge on two pillars to safeguard it against fire and flood is a point of departure for a review of learning in those areas.\n\n\"Les Suites de la Second Semaine,\" containing the third and fourth \"jours\", were printed in parts between 1591 and 1603. James VI of Scotland received a manuscript copy containing six of the eight sections of the \"Suites\" (including a version of 'Les Peres' with 830 lines not found in the printed texts) in the late 1580s. 'Le Troisieme Jour' continues the narrative into the age of Abraham: La Vocation ('The Vocation', II.iii.1) and 'Les Peres' ('The Fathers', II.iii.2) cover the end of the Book of Genesis in relating the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the sacrifice of Isaac respectively, while 'La Loy' ('The Law', II.iii.3) moves into the Exodus narrative and 'Les Captaines' ('The Captains', II.iii.4) to Joshua and Samuel. 'Le Quatrieme Jour' is devoted to David: 'Les Trophees' ('The Trophies', II.iv.1), 'La Magnificence' ('The Magnificence', II.iv.2) is about Solomon, and the final two completed sections, 'Le Schisme' ('The Schism', II.iv.3) and finally 'La Decadence' ('The Decay', II.iv.4), reviews the monarchs of the Books of Kings and Book of Chronicles.\n\n\"La Sepmaine\" was instantly successful in France: there were 42 editions between 1578 and 1632, often printed with Simon Goulart's marginal annotations and commentary. Du Bartas was the most highly esteemed French poet in France at the turn of the seventeenth century, even more so than Ronsard, and in 1620 was still regarded as the apogee of French 'grand poesie'. However, there were no further French editions of the \"Semaines\" after 1630. What were once regarded as the stylistic merits of Du Bartas' were later deemed to be weaknesses: his use of compound epithets, duplication of initial syllables, frequent inclusion of metaphors and similes and a highly compressed and accumulative style all contributed to a sense that his poetry was over-wrought and over-elaborate.\n\nNonetheless there were over thirty poems influenced by Du Bartas printed in France between 1601 and 1697, including direct continuations or parodies such as Christophe de Gamon's \"La Sepmaine\" (1609) and A. D’Argent’s \"Sepmaine\" (1629), and printed references praising Du Bartas in works written throughout this period. As late as 1684 Madeleine de Scudéry recalled the often-cited anecdote that Ronsard had once remarked that Du Bartas had achieved more in a week than he had in his entire life. Du Bartas was, however, an object of criticism: he was, for example, cited for examples of mistakes to avoid in a \"Brève instruction\" (1667). Du Bartas' reputation remained low in subsequent centuries: in 1842 Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve wrote that Du Bartas ‘a pu s’égarer et céder au mauvais goût de son temps dans le gros de ces oeuvres’ (‘was led astray and gave into the poor taste of his times in most of his work’).\n\nThough Du Bartas is still not widely known in France today, critical re-appraisals in the twentieth century, led by James Dauphiné, Yvonne Bellenger and other, have shown how Du Bartas' encyclopedic writing was representative of its time and is still worthy of attention.\n\nJames VI of Scotland's enthusiasm for Du Bartas made the Frenchman's poetry uniquely popular in sixteenth-century Scotland. James possessed a copy of \"La Sepmaine\" given to him by his nurse, and a year later wrote in the preface to his \"Essayes of a Prentise\" (Edinburgh, 1584) that\n\nThe volume contained James’s Scots translation of \"L'Uranie\". Du Bartas' synthesis of sacred and secular verse matched the King's own aesthetic preferences, and also his political imperative to consolidate his divine and political authority. The King shared Urania's sense that more poets should write about the highest matters:\n\nThomas Hudson, a court musician, was (so he writes in the preface) commissioned by the King to prepare a translation of \"Judit\", which was printed in 1584 with prefatory sonnets by James and others. Du Bartas was evidently quickly made aware of the King’s attention, for a publisher’s contract which Du Bartas signed in 1585 mentions printing the King’s translation (as well as Du Bartas’ translation of the King’s ‘Ane Schort Poeme of Tyme’).\n\nDu Bartas and James subsequently met in the summer of 1587 when the French poet travelled on a diplomatic mission to Scotland, via the English Court, to propose a marriage match between James and Henri de Navarre’s sister, Catherine de Bourbon.Though the match never happened, Du Bartas remained in high esteem with James: he received expensive gifts on departure, and the King invited him to return. It may well have been during this visit that Du Bartas translated James’ mini-epic on The Battle of Lepanto which was printed alongside James’ original poem and his translation of ‘Les Furies’ in his \"Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres\" (1591).\n\nPoets writing at the Jacobean Court (members of the so-called \"Castalian Band\") all knew of Du Bartas, who was ‘aesthetically and ideologically a role-model for James’ and ‘emblematic of the direction, spiritually, philosophically and aesthetically, in which James sought to lead his imagined renaissance’ (Sarah Dunnigan) at the Scottish Court. William Fowler and John Stewart of Baldynneis are two poets who refer to Urania as a symbolic figurehead for the kind of poetic inspiration to which they aspired in vain. Hadrian Damman’s Latin translation was dedicated to James when printed in 1600 (a manuscript copy dated 1596 also survives, National Library of Scotland MS Adv. 19.2.10). William Drummond of Hawthornden, William Alexander and Zachary Boyd are three seventeenth-century Scottish poets who knew Du Bartas’ works well; the latter two imitate his works (Sylvester's translation in Boyd's case) extensively.\n\nJames had a major impact on English responses both before and after his accession to the English throne. Gabriel Harvey is one of numerous writers in London who were reading James' translation in the 1590s: when Harvey praised Du Bartas as the ‘Treasurer of Humanity and 'Ieweller of Diuinity’ and ‘a right inspired, and enravished Poet’ in the preface to \"Pierces Supererogation\" (1593) and other works, he was in part drawing on notes made in his copy of James's \"Essayes\". A passage in the King's \"Basilikon Doron\" exhorting more poets to 'bee well versed' in Du Bartas' poetry was cited, for instance, by Thomas Winter in the dedicatory epistle of his translation of the \"Third Dayes Creation\" (1604). Joshua Sylvester dedicated his translation \"Devine Weekes and Workes\" (1605) to James, having presented a manuscript extract to the King in the previous year.\n\nDu Bartas was extremely popular in early modern England, and was still being read widely in the later seventeenth century even as his reputation in France began to decline. Around two hundred texts printed in England before 1700 make direct reference to Du Bartas, including seventy-five from the period 1641-1700. There were numerous translations of sections of the \"Semaines\" into English, of which the most significant is Josuah Sylvester's \"Devine Weekes and Workes\" (1605 et seq.; re-printed six times by 1641). Du Bartas was quickly regarded as a divine epic poet whose works took their place among the great European classics: Gabriel Harvey, for example, compared Du Bartas to Homer, Virgil and Dante.\n\nSir Philip Sidney apparently admired Du Bartas' works later in life, and his translation of 'Salust Du Bartas' was entered into the Stationers’ Register in 1588, but is now unknown. Du Bartas had in effect synthesized the two highest forms of poetry, divine and philosophical, described in Sidney’s \"Apology for Poetry\". S. K. Heninger, reflecting on similarities between Sidney and Du Bartas’ conception of poetry, writes that: ‘the reader could ponder the wide-ranging mysteries of creation. He could contemplate God’s intention, His methods, His results. The text is characterized by a Protestant passion for the truth—the truth, at once universal and concrete. It is also characterized by a Protestant devotion to the word—the word, at once comprehensive and knowable, \"logos\" though it may be.’\n\nWilliam Scott, author of ‘The Model of Poesy’ and a translator of the first two Days of \"La Sepmaine\", found moral, spiritual and aesthetic value in the poetry of 'our incomparable Bartas, who hath opened as much natural science in one week, containing the story of the creation, as all the rabble of schoolmen and philosophers have done since Plato and Aristotle.' Edmund Spenser, said by Harvey to have particularly enjoyed The Fourth Day, writes in \"The Ruines of Time\" that after Joachim Du Bellay 'gins \"Bartas\" hie to rayse | His heavenly Muse, th'Almighty to adore'; however, ‘within the shared province of Christian epic, Spenser and du Bartas remain fairly far apart’ (Susan Snyder).\n\nAccording to Snyder, ‘clearly everyone in pre-Restoration England who had received a literary education read the Weekes and almost all [...] admired it.’ Du Bartas was John Milton's ‘earliest English literary model’, and traces of direct influence are arguably most apparent in \"Poems\" 1645. Nonetheless the \"Semaines \"were a major precursor for \"Paradise Lost \", and can productively be compared with it. Du Bartas was also an early influence on Anne Bradstreet; one of her earliest dated works is her elegy ‘In Honour of Du Bartas. 1641’. The prefatory materials to \"The Tenth Muse\" (1650) make numerous references to Bradstreet's enthusiasm for Du Bartas, including Nathaniel Ward's condescending remark that Bradstreet is a 'right Du Bartas girle'. Though Bradstreet's poetry owes much to Du Bartas' methods, her work is not derivative, and she denied that her poetry imitates Du Bartas in her dedicatory poem to her father Thomas Dudley: 'I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth’ (ll. 38-9). Lucy Hutchinson would have read \"Devine Weekes\" before writing \"Order and Disorder\".\n\nDu Bartas' works, particularly and often exclusively \"La Sepmaine\", were translated into numerous other European languages in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. There were translations into Latin (by Gabriel de Lerm (1583), Jean Édouard Du Monin (1579), Hadrian Damman (1600) and Samuel Benoît (1609)), Italian (by Ferrante Guisone, first printed in 1592 and reprinted five times before 1613), Spanish (Joan Dessi, 1610, and Francisco de Cáceres in 1612) and German (Tobias Hübner, 1622 and 1631). Several Dutch translators produced versions: Zacharias Heyns (1616, 1621 and 1628), Theodorick van Liefvelt, Heer van Opdorp (1609), Wessel van den Boetselaer, Heer van Asperen (1622) and Joost van den Vondel. A Danish translation of \"La Sepmaine\" was printed in 1661, and a Swedish translation in 1685.\n\nDu Bartas' popularity apparently declined throughout Europe in the eighteenth century: in his translation of Diderot's 'Rameau's Nephew' (1805) Johann Wolfgang von Goethe expressed surprise that \"La Sepmaine\" was no longer widely known.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "229143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229143", "title": "H-dropping", "text": "H-dropping\n\nH-dropping or aitch-dropping is the deletion of the voiceless glottal fricative or \"H sound\", . The phenomenon is common in many dialects of English, and is also found in certain other languages, either as a purely historical development or as a contemporary difference between dialects. Although common in most regions of England and in some other English-speaking countries, H-dropping is often stigmatized and perceived as a sign of careless or uneducated speech.\n\nThe reverse phenomenon, H-insertion or H-adding, is found in certain situations, sometimes as a hypercorrection by H-dropping speakers, and sometimes as a spelling pronunciation or out of perceived etymological correctness. A particular example of this is the spread of 'haitch' for 'aitch'.\n\nIn Old English phonology, the sounds [h], [x] and [ç] (described respectively as glottal, velar and palatal voiceless fricatives) are taken to be allophones of a single phoneme /h/. The [h] sound appeared at the start of a syllable, either alone or in a cluster with another consonant. The other two sounds were used in the syllable coda ([x] after back vowels and [ç] after front vowels).\n\nThe instances of /h/ in coda position were lost during the Middle English and Early Modern English periods, although they are still reflected in the spelling of words such as \"taught\" (now pronounced like \"taut\") and \"weight\" (now pronounced in most accents like \"wait\"). Most of the initial clusters involving /h/ also disappeared (see H-cluster reductions). As a result, in the standard varieties of Modern English, the only position in which /h/ can occur is at the start of a syllable, either alone (as in \"hat\", \"house\", \"behind\", etc.), in the cluster /hj/ (as in \"huge\"), or (for a minority of speakers) in the cluster /hw/ (as in \"whine\" if pronounced differently from \"wine\"). The usual realizations of the latter two clusters are [ç] and [ʍ] (see English phonology).\n\nThe phenomenon of H-dropping considered as a feature of contemporary English is the omission, in certain accents and dialects, of this syllable-initial /h/, either alone or in the cluster /hj/. (For the cluster /hw/ and its reduction, see Pronunciation of English ⟨wh⟩.)\n\nH-dropping, in certain accents and dialects of Modern English, causes words like \"harm\", \"heat\", and \"behind\" to be pronounced \"arm\", \"eat\", and \"be-ind\" (though in some dialects an [h] may appear in \"behind\" to prevent hiatus – see below).\n\nCases of H-dropping occur in all English dialects in the weak forms of function words like \"he\", \"him\", \"her\", \"his\", \"had\", and \"have\". The pronoun \"it\" is a product of historical H-dropping – the older \"hit\" survives as an emphatic form in a few dialects such as Southern American English, and in the Scots language. Because the of unstressed \"have\" is usually dropped, the word is usually pronounced in phrases like \"should have\", \"would have\", and \"could have\". These can be spelled out in informal writing as \"should've\", \"would've\", and \"could've\". Because is also the weak form of the word \"of\", these words are often misspelled as \"should of\", \"would of\" and \"could of\".\n\nThere is evidence of h-dropping in texts from the 13th century and later. It may originally have arisen through contact with the Norman language, where h-dropping also occurred. Puns which rely on the possible omission of the /h/ sound can be found in works by William Shakespeare and in other Elizabethan era dramas. It is suggested that the phenomenon probably spread from the middle to the lower orders of society, first taking hold in urban centers. It started to become stigmatized, being seen as a sign of poor education, in the 16th or 17th century.\n\nH-dropping occurs (variably) in most of the dialects of the English language in England and Welsh English, including Cockney, West Country English, West Midlands English (including Brummie), most of northern England (including Yorkshire and Lancashire), and Cardiff English. It is not generally found in Scottish English. It is also typically absent in certain regions of England, including Northumberland and East Anglia.\n\nH-dropping also occurs in General Australian, most of Jamaican English, and perhaps in other Caribbean English (including some of The Bahamas). It is not generally found in North American English, although it has been reported in Newfoundland (outside the Avalon Peninsula). However, dropping of /h/ from the cluster /hj/ (so that \"human\" is pronounced /'juːmən/) is found in some American dialects, as well as in parts of Ireland – see reduction of /hj/.\n\nH-dropping, in the countries and regions in which it is prevalent, occurs mainly in working-class accents. Studies have shown it to be significantly more frequent in lower than in higher social groups. It is not a feature of RP (the prestige accent of England), or even of \"Near-RP\", a variant of RP that includes some regional features. This does not apply, however, to the dropping of /h/ in weak forms of words like \"his\" and \"her\", as described above – this is normal in all varieties of English.\n\nH-dropping in English is widely stigmatized, being perceived as a sign of poor or uneducated speech, and discouraged by schoolteachers. John Wells writes that it seems to be \"the single most powerful pronunciation shibboleth in England.\"\n\nIn fully H-dropping dialects, that is, in dialects without a phonemic , the sound may still occur but with uses other than distinguishing words. An epenthetic may be used to avoid hiatus, so that for example \"the egg\" is pronounced \"the hegg\". It may also be used when any vowel-initial word is emphasized, so that \"horse\" (assuming the dialect is also non-rhotic) and \"ass\" may be pronounced and in emphatic utterances. That is, has become an allophone of the zero onset in these dialects.\n\nFor many H-dropping speakers, however, a phonological /h/ appears to be present, even if it is not usually realized – that is, they know which words \"should\" have an /h/, and have a greater tendency to pronounce an [h] in those words than in other words beginning with a vowel. Insertion of [h] may occur as a means of emphasis, as noted above, and also as a response to the formality of a situation. Sandhi phenomena may also indicate a speaker's awareness of the presence of an /h/ – for example, some speakers might say \"a edge\" (rather than \"an edge\") for \"a hedge\", and might omit the linking R before an initial vowel resulting from a dropped H.\n\nIt is likely that the phonemic system of children in H-dropping areas lacks an /h/ entirely, but that social and educational pressures lead to the incorporation of an (inconsistently realized) /h/ into the system by the time of adulthood.\n\nThe opposite of H-dropping, called \"H-insertion\" or \"H-adding\", sometimes occurs as a hypercorrection in typically H-dropping accents of English. It is commonly noted in literature from late Victorian times to the early 20th century that some lower-class people consistently drop \"h\" in words that should have it, while adding \"h\" to words that should not have it. An example from the musical \"My Fair Lady\" is, \"In 'Artford, 'Ereford, and 'Ampshire, 'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen\". Another is in C. S. Lewis' \"The Magician's Nephew\": \"Three cheers for the Hempress of Colney 'Atch\". In practice, however, it would appear that \"h\"-adding is more of a stylistic prosodic effect, being found on some words receiving particular emphasis, regardless of whether those words are h-initial or vowel-initial in the standard language.\n\nSome English words borrowed from French begin with the letter but not with the sound . Examples include \"hour\", \"heir\", \"hono(u)r\" and \"honest\". In some cases, spelling pronunciation has introduced the sound into such words, as in \"humble\", \"hotel\" and (for most speakers) \"historic\". Spelling pronunciation has also added to the British English pronunciation of \"herb\", , while American English retains the older pronunciation . Etymology may also serve as a motivation for H-addition, as in the words \"horrible\", \"habit\" and \"harmony\"; these were borrowed into Middle English from French without an /h/ (\"orribel, abit, armonie\"), but all three derive from Latin words with an /h/ and would later acquire an /h/ in English as an etymological \"correction\". The name of the letter H itself, \"aitch\", is subject to H-insertion in some dialects, where it is pronounced \"haitch\". In Hiberno-English, \"haitch\" is considered standard.\n\nThe following is a list of some pairs of English words which may become homophones when H-dropping occurs. (To view the list, click \"show\".) See also the list of H-dropping homophones in Wiktionary.\n\nProcesses of H-dropping have occurred in various languages at certain times, and in some cases, they remain as distinguishing features between dialects, as in English. Some Dutch dialects, especially the southern ones, feature H-dropping. The dialects of Zeeland, West Flanders and North Brabant have lost /h/ as a phonemic consonant but use [h] to avoid hiatus and to signal emphasis, much as in the H-dropping dialects of English. H-dropping is also found in some North Germanic languages, for instance Elfdalian and the dialect of Roslagen, where it is found already in Old East Norse. Loss or replacement of /h/ has also occurred in some dialects of Serbian and other South Slavic languages.\n\nThe phoneme /h/ in Ancient Greek, occurring only at the beginnings of words and originally written with the letter H and later as a rough breathing, was lost in the Ionic dialect. It is also not pronounced in Modern Greek.\n\nThe phoneme /h/ was lost in Late Latin, the ancestor of the modern Romance languages. Both French and Spanish acquired new initial in medieval times, but they were later lost in both languages in a \"second round\" of H-dropping. (However, some dialects of Spanish have reacquired from Spanish and Latin .)\n\nIt is hypothesized in the laryngeal theory that the loss of [h] or similar sounds played a role in the early development of the Indo-European languages.\n\n"}

{"id": "15504805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15504805", "title": "Indexing (motion)", "text": "Indexing (motion)\n\nIndexing in reference to motion is moving (or being moved) into a new position or location quickly and easily but also precisely. When indexing a machine part, its new location is known to within a few hundredths of a millimeter (thousandths of an inch), or often even to within a few thousandths of a millimeter (ten-thousandths of an inch), despite the fact that no elaborate measuring or layout was needed to establish that location. In reference to multi-edge cutting inserts, indexing is the process of exposing a new cutting edge for use. Indexing is a necessary kind of motion in many areas of mechanical engineering and machining. A object that indexes, or can be indexed, is said to be indexable.\n\nUsually when the word \"indexing\" is used, it refers specifically to rotation. That is, indexing is most often the quick and easy but precise rotation of a machine part through a certain known number of degrees. For example, \"Machinery's Handbook\", 25th edition, in its section on milling machine indexing, says, \"Positioning a workpiece at a precise angle or interval of rotation for a machining operation is called indexing.\" In addition to that most classic sense of the word, the swapping of one part for another, or other controlled movements, are also sometimes referred to as \"indexing\", even if rotation is not the focus.\n\nThere are various examples of indexing that laypersons (non-engineers and non-machinists) can find in everyday life. These motions are not always called by the name \"indexing\", but the idea is essentially similar:\n\nIndexing is vital in manufacturing, especially mass production, where a well-defined cycle of motions must be repeated quickly and easily—but precisely—for each interchangeable part that is made. Without indexing capability, all manufacturing would have to be done on a craft basis, and interchangeable parts would have very high unit cost because of the time and skill needed to produce each unit. In fact, the evolution of modern technologies depended on the shift in methods from crafts (in which toolpath is controlled via operator skill) to indexing-capable toolpath control. A prime example of this theme was the development of the turret lathe, whose turret indexes tool positions, one after another, to allow successive tools to move into place, take precisely placed cuts, then make way for the next tool. \n\nIndexing capability is provided in two fundamental ways: with or without Information technology (IT).\n\nNon-IT-assisted physical guidance was the first means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the Industrial Revolution to progress into the Machine Age. It is achieved by jigs, fixtures, and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by the very nature of their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are drill jigs, the turrets on manual turret lathes, indexing heads for manual milling machines, rotary tables, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than indexing heads, and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops. Although indexing heads of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.\n\nIT-assisted physical guidance (for example, via NC, CNC, or robotics) has been developed since the World War II era and uses electromechanical and electrohydraulic servomechanisms to translate digital information into position control. These systems also ultimately physically limit the path for motion, as jigs and other purely mechanical means do; but they do it not simply through their own shape, but rather using changeable information.\n\n"}
{"id": "22433278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22433278", "title": "International variety", "text": "International variety\n\nAn international variety is a grape variety that is widely planted in most of the major wine producing regions and has widespread appeal and consumer recognition. These are grapes that are highly likely to appear on wine labels as varietal wines and are often considered benchmarks for emerging wine industries. There is some criticism that the popularity of so-called international varieties comes at the price of a region's indigenous varieties. The majority of declared international varieties are French in origin (most notably Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay), though in recent years the popularity of Spanish (such as Tempranillo) and Italian varietals (like Sangiovese and Nebbiolo) has seen an increase in worldwide plantings and these may also be considered \"international varieties\".\n\nWine expert Karen MacNeil describes an international variety as a \"classic variety\" which has a long established reputation for making premium quality wines in locations across the globe. The origins for many of these grapes trace back to France which has had a long history of influencing global viticulture and winemaking thought. The nine classic international varieties that MacNeil lists are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Chenin blanc, Merlot, Pinot noir, Riesling, Sauvignon blanc, Semillon and Syrah.\n\nAs the wine industry expands across the globe, particularly in the New World, more varieties beyond the nine classic varieties listed above have been gaining recognition as \"international varieties\". These include French as well as Spanish, Italian and German varieties such as Muscat, Mourvedre, Tempranillo, Sangiovese, Nebbiolo, Gewürztraminer, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Pinotage (South-Africa) and Viognier.\n\nNoble grapes are any grapes traditionally associated with the highest quality wines. Noble grapes are said to retain their character no matter where they are planted. This concept is not as common today, partly because of the proliferation of hybrid grape varieties, and partly because some critics feel that it unfairly prioritizes varieties grown within France. Historically speaking, the noble grapes comprised only six varieties. The white noble grapes were Sauvignon blanc, Riesling, and Chardonnay. The red noble grapes were Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot.\n\nThe popularity and presence of international varieties in winemaking regions throughout the world have contributed to high levels of consumer recognition for some of these varieties that often appear on wine labels as varietal wines. The recognition is so great for varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay that many consumers believe these names are either wine regions or brand names themselves. Wine expert Frank Prial of \"The New York Times\" notes that the name recognition of a grape like Chardonnay is so powerful that it \"transcends the product or its producers\".\n\nInternational varieties have been criticized as both a symbol and instigator of the globalization of wine, in which local indigenous grape varieties are grubbed up in favor of the big names demanded by international markets. In the late 20th century, during the \"Chardonnay-boom\", vineyards throughout the world and particularly in emerging wine industries rushed to plant acres of Chardonnay in order to capture some of the market. Examples of this occurred in south Italy and Spain where ancient Negroamaro, Primitivo, Grenache and Mataro vineyards were ripped up in favor of new Chardonnay plantings. This created a backlash of sorts against not only Chardonnay, but also other international varieties. Wine expert Oz Clarke described a view of Chardonnay in this light as \"...the ruthless coloniser and destroyer of the world's vineyards and the world's palates.\"\n\nEven within the industry, there are protests against the trend of planting international varieties at the expense of local varieties with winemakers such as the Languedoc producer Aimé Guibert comparing the trend to \"burning cathedrals\".\n"}

It is also known as \"Loven\", \"Laven\" or \"Boloven\" from the Laotian exonym \"Laven\" or \"Loven\", which is derived from the Khmer name for the Boloven Plateau. The Jru' people engage in coffee and cardamom cultivation, as well as other agricultural activities.\n\nJru' is a variety of Laven which belongs to the Western branch of the Bahnaric languages which also includes such languages as Brao.\n\nJru' is the native language of the Jru' people, a hill tribe indigenous to the isolated mountains in Champasak, Sekong and Attapeu Provinces in the central part of extreme southern Laos. The variety described here is the most-studied variety that is spoken in Paksong District, Champasak in the towns of Paksong, Houeikong, Tateng, and various nearby villages.\n\nThe sounds and syllable structure of Jru' are typical of the West Bahnaric languages in general. Words are mostly monosyllabic although a few words have minor pre-syllables, retaining the classic Mon-Khmer sesquisyllabic structure. The register contrast seen in other Mon-Khmer languages has not been found in Jru' and, in contrast to the surrounding prestige language, Lao, Jru' has not developed phonemic tones.\n\nSimilar to the other Mon-Khmer languages of the region, Jru' ditinguishes five places of articulation in its consonant inventory and the stops can be either voiced, unvoiced or (unvoiced) aspirated. The consonants are given below in IPA as laid out by Jacq.\n\nThe vowels of Jru' inherited from Proto-Mon-Khmer show three vowel heights and three tongue positions, or amount of \"backness\". An innovation in which Jru' developed a rounding contrast in the open-mid back vowels, results in ten vowel positions. All ten also show a length contrast, giving a total of 20 monophthongs. Unlike other languages in the Southeast Asian sprachbund, the length contrast is not between short and long, but between \"regular\" and \"extra short\".\n\nJru' additionally has three diphthongs , , and . The diphthongs and are also found in certain environments as allophones of and , respectively.\n\nThe maximal monosyllable is represented as (C)C(R)V(C) where C is any voiceless consonant, C is any consonant except one identical to C (or R if present), R is or , V is any vowel or diphthong and C is any consonant except a voiced or aspirated stop. The components in parentheses are not present in all words.\n\nThe maximal sesquisyllabic word structure is represented CəC(R)V(C) where C is , or , C is , or , V is any vowel or diphthong and C is any consonant except a voiced or aspirated stop.\n\nAs is the situation with most of the Mon-Khmer languages, Jru' has no indigenous writing system. However, at different points in history, various existing scripts including Quốc ngữ and Lao have been used or modified to transcribe the sounds of the language for study. During the Ong Keo Rebellion of the early 1900s, in which the Mon-Khmer hill tribes of the region joined together to resist French and Lao rule, Ong Kommandam, a speaker of the closely related Alak language, invented a complicated script called \"Khom\" that was used for a time to write Jru'.\n\nRecently, linguist Pascale Jacq, with the help of native speakers, has devised an orthography based on the Lao script in an attempt to provide Jru' speakers a standardized method with which to write their language. Jacq's orthography is currently being used to compile a Jru'-Lao-English-French dictionary.\n\n"}

{"id": "12364244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12364244", "title": "Language legislation in Belgium", "text": "Language legislation in Belgium\n\nThis article outlines the legislative chronology concerning the use of official languages in Belgium.\n\nA factor in the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s was the rising dominance of the Dutch language in the southern provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. A conflict arose between the citizenry of the Flemish provinces who wished to engage with the authorities in Dutch, and the largely francophone aristocracy of the southern provinces which became modern-day Belgium.\n\nWhile the Belgian Constitution guaranteed \"freedom of languages\", in practice the authorities, including government institutions such as the courts, were dominated by the French-speaking upper classes, and operated in French. In effect this bias disadvantaged the largely Flemish North and, to a lesser degree, the Walloons of the South and the mainly German- or Luxembourgish-speaking environs of Arlon). As universal education developed in Belgium, the French language was initially the sole medium of instruction, alienating the northern half of the country. There was a similar sense of alienation in other areas such as justice as the trial and conviction of two Flemish labourers, Jan Coucke and Pieter Goethals in 1860 demonstrated. The pair were sentenced to death for the murder of a widow without having understood one single word of their trial, and were then found to be innocent after they were executed.\n\nThe Flemish Movement started to advocate for language legislation that would recognise Dutch as an official language.\n\nThe first law on the use of languages was voted on in 1873, perhaps influenced by growing public dissent occasioned by cases such as the 1872 case of Jozef Schoep. He refused to pay a fine of 50 francs for not wanting to declare the birth of his son to the municipal administration of Molenbeek in French only to be convicted after an appeal in Cassation. This and other cases provoked discussions about the use of languages, and the first law on the use of languages, supported by Edward Coremans, regulated the use of languages in the courts in Flanders.\n\nDutch became the major language in Flanders, but oral testimony and penal action were still permitted in French.\n\nThe second law on the use of languages in 1878 regulated the use of language in the administrations of Flanders and Brussels. Announcements to the public by government officials had to be made in either Dutch or in both languages. Correspondence with municipalities or persons would be in Dutch unless a person expressed a wish to be engaged in French but in reality the law in daily life was hardly applied: Flemish citizens were still obliged to speak French in their communications with the administration because most civil servants were monoglots who either spoke only French or refused to use the Dutch language.\n\nUntil 1883, education in secondary schools had been entirely in French. The third law on the use of languages was voted on in order to introduce bilingual education.\n\nIn 1898, the Law on Equality was introduced. Dutch and French were now to be regarded as co-equal official languages but native French speakers in parliament, unwilling to learn or use Dutch, were either unable or unwilling to read the Dutch texts they were supposed to vote on. The reverse was not the case: Dutch speakers were obliged to learn French.)\n\nNevertheless, under pressure from the general population, the law was passed, largely due to the extension of suffrage to every male citizen aged 25 and above which increased the number of Flemish voters, and the introduction of plural voting in 1893 which allowed some eligible voters to cast more than one vote.\n\nDisagreement over the country's language policy continued. Some segments of French-speaking Wallonia were concerned that current practices could result in Belgium becoming a bilingual country, with French and Dutch being recognised as official languages everywhere. \nThis led to a proposal to split the administration in Belgium to preserve the French-speaking nature of Wallonia and to avoid the possibility that French-speaking civil servants there might have to pass a Dutch language examination.\n\nThis implied a choice: should Belgium become a bilingual country or a country with two language regions? This was expressed in two alternatives:\n\nIn 1921, the principle of territoriality was chosen, confirmed by further legislation with landmark laws passed in 1932 and 1962.\n\nThe language areas were outlined according to the principle of the language of the majority of the population, and a provision in the 1932 law determined that a language census should be conducted every ten years: a municipality could change its linguistic status only according to the findings of the census.\n\nThis more flexible approach opened the possibility of minorities representing a minimum 30% of the local population being able to obtain services in their native, or chosen, language.\n\nA 1962 law determined which municipality belonged to what language area. Each Belgian municipality is restricted to one language area, of which there are four: Dutch, French, German, and the bilingual area Brussels-Capital that includes the Belgian capital city and eighteen surrounding municipalities.\n\nFrom then on, modifications of the linguistic regime would be possible only after changing the law, which required a majority of each language community. In that same year, the municipality of Voeren (Fourons) went to the Dutch-speaking province of Limburg, and Comines (Komen) and Mouscron (Moeskroen) to the French-speaking province of Hainaut. These and several other municipalities obtained facilities for the minority language group.\n\nIn a municipality with a minority speaking another official language, facilities were provided for registered residents speaking it. For example, education in an alternative official language was made available as long as sixteen or more parents requested its provision. (However a resident of a municipality has no such rights in any neighbouring municipality.)\n\nTo benefit from these facilities, they must be asked for by the person concerned. This raised the issue of whether the facilities had to be requested on each and every occasion or whether a single request conferred a blanket benefit. In 1997 the Peeters directive required that inhabitants of such municipalities must request such facilities in their chosen language on each and every occasion they want to enjoy that right. This led to a crisis in Voeren surrounding the mayor, José Happart.\n\nProtests raised by French-speakers before the European Court of Human Rights ECtHR were mostly unsuccessful (e.g.Belgian Linguistics Case), a number of institutions such as the Catholic University of Leuven obtained authorisation to become bilingual.\n\nIn 1970, on the completion of the first state reform, four language areas were established by Article 4 of the Constitution. Since then the language affiliation of municipalities can be changed only by special law.\n\nAt the same time language communities were established, with the Flemish and French Community being responsible for the regulation of the use of languages in their language area in the areas of administration, education, and for interactions between employers and their workforce.\n\nCurrently the language used by the Belgian authorities, administration, education, businesses, and the army is determined by the courts. The constitutional right of \"freedom of language\" remains intact and absolute only in the home, leading to ongoing tensions in Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde.\n\nThe National Railway Company of Belgium's policy is to provide information on the train in the language of the region. For example, on a train travelling from Antwerp to Charleroi, announcements are made first in Dutch (in the Flemish Region), then in French and Dutch (in the Brussels-Capital Region), again in Dutch and finally in French in Wallonia. This requires rail travellers be conversant with the name of their destination in both languages (though on-board ticket inspectors are bound to respond in either language).\n\nIn and around international stations, such as the Brussels Airport, Dutch and French announcements are supplemented by announcements in German and English.\n\nAs mentioned above, road signs are required to give destinations only in the local language, requiring travellers to recognise their ultimate and intermediate destinations in multiple languages. For example, on the Belgian portion of the E40 motorway, westbound travellers to Liège are directed to \"Lüttich\" and eastbound travellers are directed to \"Luik\", but signs near the city itself refer only to \"Liège\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7873815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7873815", "title": "Languages of Sweden", "text": "Languages of Sweden\n\nSwedish is the official language of Sweden and is spoken by the vast majority of the 10 million inhabitants of the country. It is a North Germanic language and quite similar to its sister Scandinavian languages, Danish and Norwegian, with which it maintains partial mutual intelligibility and forming a dialect continuum.\n\nFor most of its history, Sweden was a larger country than today. At its height in 1658, the Swedish Empire comprised the territories of what is Finland and Estonia as well as parts of Russia, Latvia, Germany, Denmark and Norway. Hence, Sweden's linguistic landscape has historically been very different from that of today.\nSwedish evolved from Old Norse around the 14th and 15th century, and historically, the Swedish dialects were generally much more different than today. Since the 20th century Standard Swedish prevails throughout the country. The Scandinavian languages constitute a dialectal continuum and some of the traditional Swedish dialects could equally be described as Danish (Scanian) or Norwegian (Jamtlandic).\n\nFinnish was the majority language of Sweden's eastern parts, though it was used almost exclusively as a spoken language. These areas were also home of a significant Swedish-speaking minority. Finnish became a minority language in the west as well since many Finnish speakers migrated there (mostly for economic reasons).\n\nEstonian was the language of the majority in Swedish Estonia but the province, like Finland hosted a Swedish-speaking minority and also a more significant minority of Germans.\n\nIn medieval Sweden, the Low German language had a very important role as a commercial language and the lingua franca of the Hanseatic league. As such, the Low German language influenced Swedish and other languages in the region considerably. In medieval Stockholm, half of the population were Low German speakers. Low German was also the language spoken in the 17th-century Swedish territories in northern Germany i.e. Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, Wismar and Wildeshausen (as well as the rest of northern Germany) and by the German minority in Estonia and Swedish Livonia. Livonia was also inhabited by Latvians, Estonians and Livonians.\n\nIn Swedish Ingria, apart from Swedish also Finnish, Ingrian and Votian were spoken.\n\nLatin as the language of the Catholic Church was introduced in Sweden with the Christianisation, around AD 1000. As in most of Europe, Latin remained the lingua franca and scholarly language of the educated communities for centuries in Sweden. For instance, Carl Linnaeus' most famous work Systema Naturae, published in 1735, was written in Latin.\n\nDuring the 18th century, French was the second language of Europe's upper classes and Sweden was no exception. The Swedish aristocracy often spoke French among themselves and code-switching between French and Swedish was common. The Swedish King Gustav III was a true Francophile and French was the common language at his court.\n\nGradually Sweden lost its overseas possessions and obtained its current borders in 1809, when it lost its eastern part (Finland) to the Russian Empire. As a consequence, Sweden became a rather homogeneous country with the exceptions of the indigenous Sami-people and the Finnish-speaking Tornedalians in the northernmost parts of the country.\n\nDuring the 19th century Sweden became more industrialised, resulting in important demographic changes. The population duplicated and people moved from the countryside to towns and cities. As a consequence, of this and factors such as generalised education and mass media, the traditional dialects began to give room for the standard language (Standard Swedish). A large number of Swedes also decided to emigrate, especially to the United States. There, the Swedes came in contact with the English language. Since then, as in the rest of Europe and much of the world, English has grown as an important foreign language in Sweden, especially since the allied victory in World War II.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, Sweden has received great numbers of immigrants who speak languages other than Swedish (see: Immigrant languages below). It is unclear to what degree these communities will hold on to their languages and to what degree they will assimilate.\n\nThe Kingdom of Sweden is a nation-state for the Swedish people, and as such, their national language is held in very high regard. Of Sweden's roughly ten million people, almost all speak Swedish as at least a second language, and the majority as a first language (7,825,000, according to SIL's Ethnologue). Swedish is also an official language in Finland where it is spoken by a large number of Swedish-speaking Finns. The language is also spoken to some degree by ethnic Swedes living outside Sweden, for example, just over half a million people of Swedish descent in the United States speak the language, according to Ethnologue.\n\nA number of Swedish dialects exist, some of which are divergent enough from standard Swedish to be considered separate languages.\n\nWestrobothnian is a common name used to refer to a number of closely related Germanic, North Germanic languages spoken in historical Westrobothnia (modern coastal areas of Westrobothnia and Norrbotten) bordering areas with speakers of Sami to the west, Meänkeli Finnish to the north, Jamtlandic to the south-west and dialects of national standard Swedish to the south. Like other Scandinavian languages, all different forms of Westrobothnian originate in Proto-Norse and dialects of Old Norse that started diverging as distinct languages during the Viking Age. Dialects differ greatly between different areas and the language has traditionally merely been a spoken language since no standard spelling was available. The following cities and surrounding villages have a traditionally Westrobothnian speaking population: Piteå, Skellefteå, Umeå, Luleå and Kalix.\n\nThe Dalecarlian (Elfdalian) dialect group is highly divergent, even within itself, so that speakers of separate sub-dialects do not always understand each other. Dialects of this group are spoken in the northern parts of the province of Dalarna, especially in the Älvdalen Municipality, by a population of 1,500.\n\nModern Gutnish exists as a spoken language in Gotland and Fårö. It is an open issue whether modern Gutnish is to be considered an independent language or a Scandinavian dialect. It derives, however, from Old Gutnish, which is indisputably a separate branch of the Old Norse language family.\n\nSpoken mainly in Jämtland, but with a scattered speaker population throughout the rest of Sweden, Jamtlandic or Jamska is a West Scandinavian language with 95% lexical similarity to Norwegian and Swedish, but generally more archaic. It has a native speaker population of 30,000.\n\nSpoken in the Swedish province of Scania (\"Skåne\" in Swedish), the Scanian dialect is considered by some to be a dialect of Danish, and a related dialect is also spoken in Bornholm, where it is called \"East Danish\" (Scania was part of the kingdom of Denmark until 1658). The variety generally spoken today is heavily influenced by standard Swedish.\n\nIn 1999, the Minority Language Committee of Sweden formally declared five minority languages of Sweden: Finnish, Meänkieli (also known as Tornedal, Tornionlaaksonsuomi or Tornedalian), the Sami languages, Romani, and Yiddish.\n\nToday there are about 470,000 Finnish-speakers in Sweden. Finnish, a Uralic language, has long been spoken in Sweden (the same holds true for Swedish in Finland, \"see Finland-Swedes, Åland\"), as Finland was part of the Swedish kingdom for centuries. Ethnic Finns (mainly first and second generation immigrants) constitute up to 5% of the population of Sweden. A high concentration of Finnish-speakers (some 16,000) resides in Norrbotten.\n\nMeänkieli is also a Finnic language. Spoken by the Tornedalian people, it is so closely related to Finnish that they are mutually intelligible, and is sometimes considered a dialect of Finnish. Meänkieli is mainly used in the municipalities of Gällivare, Haparanda, Kiruna, Pajala and Övertorneå, all of which lie in the Torne Valley. Between 40,000 and 70,000 people speak Meänkieli as their first language.\n\nThe Sami people (formerly known as Lapps) are a people indigenous to all of northern Scandinavia (see Sápmi (area)) who speak a closely related group of languages usually grouped together under the name \"Sami\", but at least three separate Sami languages are spoken in Sweden. They are, like Finnish and Meänkieli, Uralic. Prolonged exposure to Germanic-language-speaking neighbors in Sweden and Norway causes them to have a large number of Germanic loanwords not normally found in other Uralic languages like Finnish, Estonian, or Hungarian. Between 15,000 and 20,000 Sami people live in Sweden of whom 9,000 are Sami-language speakers. Worldwide, between 20,000 and 40,000 people speak Sami languages (most Sami now speak Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, or Russian as their first language, depending on the country in which they reside). In Sweden, the largest concentrations of Sami-language-speaking Sami are found in the municipalities of Arjeplog, Gällivare, Jokkmokk and Kiruna, and its immediate neighbourhood.\n\nRomani (also known as the Romani Chib) is the language spoken by the Romani people, a nomadic ethnic group originating in northern India. Due to the geographic origins of its speakers, Romani is an Indo-Aryan language, closely related to languages spoken in modern-day India, and sometimes written with an Indic Script (see Romani writing systems). Around 90% of Sweden's Romani people speak Romani, meaning that there are approximately 9,500 Chib speakers. In Sweden, there is no major geographic center for Romani like there is for Finnish, Sami, or Meänkieli, but it is considered to be of historical importance by the Swedish government, and as such the government is seen as having an obligation to preserve them, a distinction also held by Yiddish.\nYiddish is a Germanic language with significant Hebrew and Slavic influence, written with a variant of the Hebrew Alphabet (see Yiddish orthography) and, formerly, spoken by most Ashkenazic Jews (although most now speak the language of the country in which they live). Although the Jewish population of Sweden was traditionally Sephardic, after the 18th century, Ashkenazic immigration began, and the immigrants brought with them their Yiddish language (See History of the Jews in Sweden). Like Romani, it is seen by the government to be of historical importance. The organisation \"Sällskapet för Jiddisch och Jiddischkultur i Sverige\" (Society for Yiddish and Yiddish Culture in Sweden) has over 200 members, many of whom are mother-tongue Yiddish speakers, and arranges regular activities for the speech community and in external advocacy of the Yiddish language.\n\nAs of 2009, the Jewish population in Sweden was estimated at around 20,000. Out of these 2,000-6,000 claim to have at least some knowledge of Yiddish according to various reports and surveys. The number of native speakers among these has been estimated by linguist Mikael Parkvall to be 750-1,500. It is believed that virtually all native speakers of Yiddish in Sweden today are adults, and most of them elderly.\n\nSwedish Sign Language is an officially recognized minority language.\n\nSince the Middle Ages until the end of World War II, Germany was usually the country outside Scandinavia having the closest cultural, commercial and political relations with Sweden. Thus, study of the German language had always been promoted by the Swedish state as the main foreign language. Many of Sweden's administrative and social institutions, including the education system, had also been organised along the German and Prussian model, as a lot of Swedish pioneering intellectuals of the Seventeenth century had been educated in German universities. This changed after the end of the Second World War, when it was no longer acceptable to emphasise a closer link with defeated Germany.\nA majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, are able to understand and speak English thanks to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong American influence, especially in regards to arts and culture, and the tradition of subtitling rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films. English, whether in American, Commonwealth (Australian, Canadian, and Kiwi), or British dialects, became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as 1849 and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since 1952, when it replaced German as the compulsory language subject.\n\nDepending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject from third until ninth grade, and all students continuing in secondary school study English for at least another year. Most students also learn one and sometimes two additional languages; the most popular being German, French and Spanish. From the autumn semester 2014, Mandarin Chinese is proposed as a fourth additional language. Some Danish and Norwegian is, at times, also taught as part of the Swedish course taught to native speakers of Swedish to emphasize differences and similarities between the languages.\n\nThere is currently an ongoing debate among linguists whether English should be considered a foreign language, second language or transcultural language in Sweden (and the other Scandinavian countries) due to its widespread use in education and society in general. This has also triggered opposition: in 2002 the Swedish government proposed an action plan to strengthen the status of Swedish and in 2009 Swedish was announced the official language of the country for the first time in its history. In 2013, for the second year in a row, Swedes were ranked as best in the world at speaking English by the language proficiency company EF English First.\n\nLike many developed European countries from the late 1940s to the 1970s, Sweden has received tens of thousands of guest workers from countries in Southern Europe and the Middle East (i.e. Bulgaria, Greece, Iraq, Italy, Romania, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the former Yugoslavia). Second and third-generation Swedes of Southern European or Middle Eastern descent have adopted Swedish as their main tongue, or in addition to their immigrant languages, such as Arabic, Bulgarian, Greek, Italian, Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian, and Turkish. However, the criteria in European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages state that minority languages need a long history in the country to receive the classification, and thus, these languages have not come into question.\n\n\n"}

There are many languages spoken in the country, but no one language is spoken natively by a majority or a large plurality of the population. The Bantu Swahili language and English, the latter of which was inherited from colonial rule (\"see Tanganyika Territory\"), are widely spoken as lingua francas. They serve as working languages in the country, with Swahili being the official national language. There are more speakers of Swahili than of English in Tanzania.\n\nAccording to \"Ethnologue\", there are a total of 126 languages spoken in Tanzania. Two are institutional, 18 are developing, 58 are vigorous, 40 are endangered, and 8 are dying. There are also three languages that recently became extinct.\n\nMost languages spoken locally belong to two broad language families: Niger-Congo (Bantu branch) and Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic branch), spoken by the country's Bantu and Nilotic populations, respectively. Additionally, the Hadza and Sandawe hunter-gatherers speak languages with click consonants, which have tentatively been classified within the Khoisan phylum (although Hadza may be a language isolate). The Cushitic and Semitic ethnic minorities speak languages belonging to the separate Afro-Asiatic family, with the Hindustani and British residents speaking languages from the Indo-European family.\n\nTanzania's various ethnic groups typically speak their mother tongues within their own communities. The two official languages, English and Swahili, are used in varying degrees of fluency for communication with other populations. According to the official national linguistic policy announced in 1984, Swahili is the language of the social and political sphere as well as primary and adult education, whereas English is the language of secondary education, universities, technology, and higher courts. The government announced in 2015 that it would discontinue the use of English as a language of education as part of an overhaul of the Tanzanian schools system.\n\nAdditionally, several Tanzanian sign languages are used.\n\nMajor languages spoken in Tanzania include:\n\n\nLanguages spoken by the country's ethnic minorities include:\n\n\n\n"}

He started his studies by reading the Koran, and then Arabic, Persian, Ottoman and Kurdish. He then moved to Tabriz in north-western Iran to continue his studies. After finishing his studies, he went back to his hometown and became a teacher. After the fall of Kurdish emirates in Bayazid, he moved to Erzurum.\n\nIn 1856, the Russian academic \"A. Dorne\", asked \"A.D. Jaba\", the newly appointed Russian consulate in Erzurum, for assistance in analyzing documents in the Kurdish language. Jaba, in turn, employed Mahmud Bayazidi in the field of Kurdish language, history and Culture. With the assistance of Bayazidi, a number of Kurdish documents were sent to the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg, including some of Bayazidi's own writings. In 1858-1859, Bayazidi, edited the Kurdish-Arabic-Persian grammar book by \"Ali Taramokhi\" (Kurdish writer of 15-16th century). He also wrote a book containing 3,000 phrases in Kurdish, which shed light on the life of Kurds in the 19th century. This book was translated into French by \"A.D. Jaba\" in 1880. Bayazidi, wrote another book called \"Habits and Customs of Kurds\", which has been published in 1963 by the famous Russian Kurdologist . From the correspondences of \"A.D. Jaba\" with Saint Petersburg, it is evident that Bayazidi had written a book about the modern history of the Kurds, covering the period 1785-1858, although this book appears to have been lost, except for the French translation of its preface. Bayazidi and Jaba also played an instrumental role in preserving old Kurdish literature by collecting more than 50 volumes of old hand written Kurdish classic texts and sending them to the Library of Saint Petersburg. These texts which have been preserved until now, include the epics of well known classical poets such as Faqi Tayran, Malaye Bate, Malaye Jaziri and \"Mem û Zîn\" (Mam and Zin) by Ahmad Khani. This collection was finally published in 1961 by \"M.B. Rudenko\", titled \"About the hand-written Kurdish texts in Leningrad\".\n\nDuring the period 1858-1859, Mahmud Bayazidi and \"A.D. Jaba\", wrote the first Kurdish-French and French-Kurdish dictionary, published in 1879. During the same period, Mahmud Bayazidi, translated the \"Sharafnama\" (history of the Kurdish nation) from Persian into Kurdish. This is considered to be the first Kurdish history book in modern times. Its hand-written version is preserved in the Russian National Library. It was published for the first time in 1986.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43527", "title": "Mon language", "text": "Mon language\n\nThe Mon language (; ) is an Austroasiatic language spoken by the Mon people, who live in Myanmar. Mon, like the related Khmer language, but unlike most languages in mainland Southeast Asia, is not tonal. In recent years, usage of Mon has declined rapidly, especially among the younger generation. Many ethnic Mon are monolingual in Burmese, and the language is classified as \"vulnerable\" by UNESCO. The current number of speakers is approximately 800,000 in 2007. In Myanmar, the majority of speakers live in Mon State, followed by Tanintharyi Region and Kayin State.\n\nMon is an important language in Burmese history. Up until the 12th century, it was the lingua franca of the Irrawaddy valley—not only in the Mon kingdoms of the lower Irrawaddy but also of the upriver Pagan Kingdom of the Bamar people. Mon, especially written Mon, continued to be the primary language even after the fall of the Mon kingdom of Thaton to Pagan in 1057. Pagan king Kyansittha (r. 1084–1113) admired Mon culture and the Mon language was patronized. The Mon script was adopted for Burmese during his reign.\n\nKyanzittha left many inscriptions in Mon. During this period, the Myazedi inscription, which contains identical inscriptions of a story in Pali, Pyu, Mon and Burmese on the four sides, was carved.\n\nHowever, after Kyansittha's death, usage of the Mon language declined among the Bamar and the Burmese language began to replace Mon and Pyu as a lingua franca.\n\nMon inscriptions from Dvaravati's ruins also litter Thailand. However it is not clear if the inhabitants were Mon, a mix of Mon and Malay or Khmer. Later inscriptions and kingdoms like Lavo were subservient to the Khmer Empire.\n\nAfter the fall of Pagan, the Mon language again became the lingua franca of the Mon Hanthawaddy Kingdom (1287–1539) in present-day Lower Burma. The language long continued to be prevalent in Lower Burma until the mid-19th century because the region was still mainly populated by Mon. This changed after the British captured Lower Burma in 1852, and encouraged immigration to develop Irrawaddy Delta for farming. The ensuing mass migration of peoples into the region from other areas of Burma as well as India and China relegated the Mon language to a tertiary status.\n\nThe language languished during British colonial rule, and has experienced a rapid decline in the number of speakers since the Burmese independence in 1948. Currently, according to scholars, the number of Mon speakers is relatively very small when compared to the large numbers who identify themselves as Mon people. With little or no support from successive Burmese governments, the Mon language (especially written Mon) continues to be propagated mostly by Mon monks. The Mon language instruction survives in the Thai-Burmese border inside the Mon rebel controlled areas.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that the Mawlamyine-based \"Thanlwin Times\" would begin to carry news in the Mon language, becoming Myanmar's first Mon language publication since 1962.\n\nMon has three primary dialects in Burma, coming from the various regions the Mon inhabit. They are the Central (areas surrounding Mottama and Mawlamyine), Bago, and Ye dialects. All are mutually intelligible. Thai Mon has some differences from the Burmese dialects of Mon, but they are mutually intelligible.\n\n\"Ethnologue\" lists Mon dialects as Martaban-Moulmein (Central Mon, Mon Te), Pegu (Mon Tang, Northern Mon), and Ye (Mon Nya, Southern Mon), with high mutual intelligibility among them.\n\nThe Old Mon script, which has been dated to the 6th century, with the earliest inscriptions found in Nakhon Pathom and Saraburi (in Thailand). It may be the ancestral script of the modern Mon (or Burma Mon) script although no one has shown a linkage between the Old Mon script of Dvaravati and Burma Mon. The extant archaeological evidence shows that Burma Mon was derived from the Burmese alphabet, not the other way around. The modern Mon alphabet, however, utilizes several letters and diacritics that do not exist in Burmese, such as the stacking diacritic for medial 'l', which is placed underneath the letter. (See Burmese script.)\n\nThere is a great deal of discrepancy between the written and spoken forms of Mon, with a single pronunciation capable of having several spellings. The Mon script also makes prominent use of consonant stacking, to represent consonant clusters found in the language.\n\nThe Mon alphabet contains 35 consonants (including a zero consonant), as follows, with consonants belonging to the breathy register indicated in gray:\nIn the Mon script, consonants belong to one of two registers: clear and breathy, each of which has different inherent vowels and pronunciations for the same set of diacritics. For instance, , which belongs to the clear register, is pronounced , while is pronounced , to accommodate the vowel complexity of the Mon phonology. The addition of diacritics makes this obvious. Whereas in Burmese, spellings with the same diacritics are rhyming, in Mon, this depends on the consonant's inherent register. A few examples are listed below:\n\nThe Mon language has 8 medials, as follows: (), (), (), (), (), (), (), and ().\n\nConsonantal finals are indicated with a virama (), as in Burmese: however, instead of being pronounced as glottal stops as in Burmese, final consonants usually keep their respective pronunciations. Furthermore, consonant stacking is possible in Mon spellings, particularly for Pali and Sanskrit-derived vocabulary.\n\nMon uses the same diacritics and diacritic combinations as in Burmese to represent vowels, with the addition of a few diacritics unique to the Mon script, including (), and (), since the diacritic represents . Also, () is used instead of , as in Burmese.\n\n is used for a comma, and is used for a period.\n\n is only found in Burmese loans.\n\nUnlike the surrounding Burmese and Thai languages, Mon is not a tonal language. As in many Mon–Khmer languages, Mon uses a vowel-phonation or vowel-register system in which the quality of voice in pronouncing the vowel is phonemic. There are two registers in Mon:\n\n\nOne study involving speakers of a Mon dialect in Thailand found that in some syllabic environments, words with a breathy voice vowel are significantly lower in pitch than similar words with a clear vowel counterpart. While difference in pitch in certain environments was found to be significant, there are no minimal pairs that are distinguished solely by pitch. The contrastive mechanism is the vowel phonation.\n\nIn the examples below, breathy voice is marked with a grave accent.\n\nMon verbs do not inflect for person. Tense is shown through particles.\n\nSome verbs have a morphological causative, which is most frequently a /pə-/ prefix (Pan Hla 1989:29):\n\nMon nouns do not inflect for number. That is, they do not have separate forms for singular and plural:\n'one apple'\n'two apples'\n\nAdjectives follow the noun (Pan Hla p. 24):\n'beautiful woman'\n\nDemonstratives follow the noun:\n\nLike many other Southeast Asian languages, Mon has classifiers which are used when a noun appears with a numeral. The choice of classifier depends on the semantics of the noun involved.\n'one pen'\n'one tree'\n\nMon is a prepositional language.\n\nThe ordinary word order for sentences in Mon is subject–verb–object, as in the following examples\n\n'I bought rice.'\n'They taught me English.'\n\nYes-no questions are shown with a final particle \"ha\"\n\n‘Have you eaten rice?’\n\n‘Will father go?’ (Pan Hla, p. 42)\n\nWh-questions show a different final particle, \"rau\". The interrogative word does not undergo wh-movement. That is, it does not necessarily move to the front of the sentence:\n'What did you wash?'\n\n\n"}

A number of scholars have distinguished in Pamphylian dialect important isoglosses with Arcadocypriot which allow them to be studied together. Pamphylia means \"land of all phyles (tribes)\". The Achaeans may have settled the region under the leadership of Amphilochus, Calchas, and Mopsus. However, other cities in Pamphylia were established by different Greek tribes: Aspendos was a colony of Argos, Side was a colony of Aeolian Cyme, Sillyon was a colony of an unknown Greek mother city, and Perga was a colony established by a wave of Greeks from northern Anatolia. The isolation of the dialect took place even before the appearance of the Greek article. Pamphylian is the only dialect that does not use articles other than Mycenean Greek and poetic language.\n\nPamphylia had a variant local alphabet, that made use both of the original \"Pamphylian digamma\" (И) and a standard digamma (Ϝ), which was probably borrowed from other Greek alphabets.

{"id": "25223007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25223007", "title": "Prepress proofing", "text": "Prepress proofing\n\nA contract proof usually serves as an agreement between customer and printer and as a color reference guide for adjusting the press before the final press run. Most contract proofs are a prepress proof.\n\nThe primary goal of proofing is to serve as a tool for customer verification that the entire job is accurate. Prepress proofing (also known as off-press proofing) is a cost-effective way of providing a visual copy without the expense of creating a press proof. If errors are found during the printing process on press, correcting them can prove very costly to one or both parties involved.\n\nPress time is the most expensive part of print media. The main objective of proofing is to produce either a soft or hard copy of what the final product will look like on press. Hard-copy proofing usually involves ink-jet printing or other technologies (i.e. Laminate Proof) to produce high-quality one-off copies of the production artwork. Soft proofing usually involves highly color accurate wide-gamut computer displays.\n\n\"The printed proof is a dispassionate simulation of the ultimate output – a CMYK press sheet. The mission of a proofing system is to create accurate predictions, not pretty pictures.\" In the best conditions the proofing process will actually try to emulate the effects of the printing press through color management and screening techniques, which can be quite challenging because proofing devices may behave and operate quite differently from press devices.\n\nSince the first days of Johannes Gutenberg, proofing has just been press proofs - one makes a short run on the press in order to verify what is to be done on a production run. As technology evolved to lower the per-copy cost of a printing job, the cost of starting a production run continued to rise. Today, it can be very costly to start up a production press, and thus it is cost-prohibitive to run a press proof. While some people may think a press proof is the ultimate proof quality, this is not necessarily so, especially if the production run is done days or weeks later when press conditions may have changed, or the production run is done on a different press than the press proof.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the first overlay systems were developed. These systems produce each of the process colors on a separate sheet of clear film and then register them together to view the final proof.\n\nThe Ozalid division of General Aniline and Film (GAF) Corporation created Ozachrome as the first commercial system used in proofing. Diazo (light-sensitive dye) coatings on film were used for each of the process colors, and the films were developed using ammonia vapor. The initial process colors used were red, yellow, blue and black, although other colors may have been used in subsequent years. A black separation was processed on a white paper, while the remaining separations were processed on clear cellulose acetate.\n\nAround 1965, 3M invented an overlay system called Color Key. Basically, sheets of clear polyester were coated with UV-sensitive pigmented emulsions in the four process colors, cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Later, spot colors were created (Color Key Custom Colors). The sheets were exposed to the artwork via a carbon arc lamp, washed with water and process chemicals, and then dried.\n\nAs of 2010, overlay proofs are still created, for example for small single-drum presses where each color has to be a separate run. Such proofs are usually made using either inkjet printers or lamination devices.\n\nInternal (single-sheet) or laminate systems attempt to overcome the problems with overlay systems by putting all process colors on a single sheet of media. After the end of World War II, the first commercial system, called Watercote, was introduced by the Direct Reproduction Corporation.\n\nBy the 1970s, 3M developed Transfer Key technology, which used a cold lamination adhesive process. Successive layers of colored adhesive would be pressed on the substrate, exposed and washed away until all the colors existed on a single substrate. This later evolved into the Match Print product, which used a thermal transfer lamination process. The Match Print trade mark has since been sold to Kodak, which uses it today in its MATCHPRINT InkJet and MATCHPRINT Virtual products. Both Color Key and Match Print have also become generic names for types of prepress proofs. Later, other similar water process products such as DuPont Waterproof came on the market.\n\nIn the early 1960s, several attempts were made to develop electrophotographic proofing processes based on the electrofax principle, using paper coated with zinc oxide in a resistive binder as a photoconductor, along with toners consisting of ink pigments dispersed in liquid Isopar. The electrofax principle was introduced in the United States by RCA, and the use of liquid toners was developed in Australia by Ralph Metcalf and Robert Wright of the Australian government. Other groups worked on similar processes, but these never got to market.\n\nLater in the 1970s, toner-based solutions such as Dupont Cromalin were developed.\n\nBy the 1980s, custom colors, including white and metallics such as gold and silver, were becoming commonplace.\n\nBy 1987, the first Iris printer was commercialized. This was a continuous stream inkjet printer that was later followed by the Veris printer in 2004. Initially, these printers had unparalleled quality in inkjet printing, but steady advances in drop-on-demand printers has made their quality acceptable to more and more prepress shops. As of 2010, both Iris and Veris devices are still in use.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dye Sublimation was introduced with products like 3M Rainbow and Kodak DCP9000 and DCP9500.\n\nAlso in the early 1990s, Laser Sublimation systems were introduced. Products such as the Fuji FINALPROOF, and Kodak Approval are still in use today.\n\nIn the late 1990s, laser thermal transfer was developed. These systems are still in use, such as the Creo (now Kodak) Spectrum. The Spectrum was notable in that the same platesetter device used to make plates was also used to make proofs, resulting in proofs with identical screening as the press.\n\nBy 2005, the first spectrophotometers were integrated with inkjet printers, such as the Creo Veris and HP 2100. By 2009, Epson released a printer with an integrated spectrophotometer. By automating the measurement process, this eliminates much of the labor involved in calibrating the proofing system and validating the proofs. However, it slows down overall throughput of the proofing device, so more proofing devices are needed to maintain throughput.\n\nBy 2003, soft proofing emerged using well-calibrated and profiled computer displays under highly controlled viewing conditions. This approach continues to gain in popularity due to the much lower cost and lesser production time than producing a hard-copy proof.\n\nAs of 2010, the majority of hard-copy contract proofing is done on inkjet and laminate devices, while soft proofing continues to gain popularity.\n\nSince the late 1990s, a number of software proofing solutions were developed by companies. Previously, proofing systems were typically a complete solution from one vendor, but as software has become the dominant enabling technology in proofing, customers enjoy the benefits of being able to use commodity print devices over special proofing devices.\n\nDepending on the quality needed and the use of product, there are two major types of proof:\n\n\nSoft proof describes the simulation of the print result on a monitor. This is the cheapest solution for proofing since no additional equipment, except a monitor, is needed.\n\nUsually soft proof is done in software applications in combination with color management systems. The monitor used for soft proofing must be calibrated, so that the image on the screen looks like the image on the paper. The major problem is the difference of color spaces (RGB in monitor and CMYK in print), and this is solved by using ICC profiles for input and output devices. Moreover, colors on a monitor depend not only on its properties, but also on lighting conditions in a room where the image is viewed. Usually, lighting is standardized and is close to a daylight (D50).\n\nSoft proofing can be used an unlimited number of times, and is most useful when editing images and designing layout, but is normally not used as a contract proof.\n\nIt should be noted that the use of soft proofs in low end printing has become prevalent in recent years allowing for a time and cost savings where color management is not crucial.\n\nHard proof is an actual printed sample of a printed product. It is further divided into five general classifications \n\nBlueprint (originated from conventional platemaking) is a copy printed in one color and used for checking and correcting mistakes in contents, imposition layout and completeness of data.\n\nImposition proof (Layout proof) is similar to blueprint, but the copy is printed in color. Imposition proof is usually done with a large-format color inkjet printer.\n\nColor proof provides the color-reliable/color-true reproduction of the contents of the file intended for printing. Color proof is made with inkjet printers or thermal sublimation printers in combination with powerful color-management systems. Proofing is usually performed in full-size format, but in some cases small-page format is also acceptable. Color proof serves as a guideline for a printing press operator, and usually stands for a contract proof.\n\nScreen Proof (True Proof) is a method of proofing used for simulating a raster structure of the printed image. Performing this proof makes it possible to recognize different raster-dependent effects such as smoothness, grade and range of tonal gradations, and moiré or rosette patterns.\n\nSeveral vendors offer special proof systems for creating a screen proof. The proof is produced via color donors and thermal transfer (ablation) onto intermediate carriers or onto the substrate used for the print run. Both systems are imagesetter-like devices with which the image motifs can be reproduced in every detail including their color, screen definition, and screen angles. The true proof systems use color foils that are to be processed in separate units (laminators), transferred from intermediate carriers onto production paper and/or laminated, either to protect the proof or to give it the appearance of the surface structure of production paper.\n\nPress proof is a test print of the data directly on a printing press. This can be the press for the production run or a comparable press (using the same print technology) prepared especially for proof purposes. Short runs of 50 or 100 copies can be produced more cost-effectively than with other color proof processes. The individual proof is, however, hardly economically justifiable.\n\nProofing can either be viewed subjectively as an art based on training, experience, talent and judgment; or objectively as a science based on measurement, algorithms, and analysis; but in practice it is somewhere in between. Increasingly, however, printers rely on scientific methods, as it is often more cost-effective to buy the necessary technology than to acquire, train and retain skilled artisans.\n\nIn many cases, it makes sense to align the proof with the press, but in other cases it makes sense to align the press with the proof. Typically, one would align the press with the proof when one is trying to achieve a particular industry specification (i.e. Fogra, GRACoL, SWOP, etc.). In situations where one is trying to achieve the best possible color on a particular press, typically to distinguish oneself as a printer, one would define a custom color standard for the press and then align the proof with the press.\n\nA central aspect of scientific proofing is process control, which consists of baselining, characterizing and calibrating the proofing process.\n\nA baseline is representation of the output device settings (i.e. paper feed, head alignment, etc.) and associated conditions (i.e. media, ink, screening, etc.). A baseline is created by adjusting device settings under a given set of conditions and running test samples, measuring the samples, readjusting the settings, until the output process is brought to an optimal state. Once optimized, a final set of measurements are made of output samples and this data becomes part of the baseline information.\n\nThe baseline is then characterized by outputting ECI or IT8.7/4 test charts (samples of color patches), then the charts are scanned with a spectrophotometer to finally produce a color profile of the baseline.\n\nOver time, specific device performance (and other conditions) may vary. Certainly different devices of the same device type will also vary with respect to the baseline data. However it is essential that the proofing system always perform as closely as possible to the original color profile. Calibration is a process of outputting more color charts, measuring them and adjusting the color mapping until system performance is as close as possible to the original baseline and color profile. During calibration, device settings may also be changed to achieve an optimal output process and subsequent color match.\n\nIn ideal circumstances, the printing press will also be characterized and calibrated using similar techniques. When there exists a color profile of the press device and a color profile of proofing device, the best emulation of the press on the proofing device is possible. Doing this accurately requires well controlled and repeatable processes (including calibration), in order to ensure that the color profiles continue to represent the devices involved.\n\nProof Validation is another aspect of process control. While calibration only ensures that the proofing system is producing output as close to the baseline as possible, proof validation embeds color charts in the artwork itself to ensure that at the artwork matches an industry color standard or a custom color standard (i.e. a specific press that has been characterized). In short, it validates that the proofing system emulates the desired press results accurately.\n\nProducing proofs for packaging faces a number of challenges beyond those for conventional offset press.\n\nOften, customers want three-dimensional mock-ups of the actual package. This could be cardboard, metal (i.e., aluminum pop can), glass, plastic, etc. This can be very difficult, or impossible to do effectively using inkjet printers, so typically laminate processes such as Kodak APPROVAL or Fuji FINALPROOF are needed, so that the proof can be transferred to the preferred packaging materials.\n\nIn the case of cardboard cartons, an automated cutting-and-creasing table is useful. Typically, computer-aided design (CAD) software is used to define the cuts and creases based on the proof geometry, and this is fed into the cutting-and-creasing table software.\n\nMost packaging is printed using flexography, because it is more versatile over the range of materials used in packaging. However, the image quality of flexographic prints is often inferior to offset presses, and it is important to simulate the characteristics of the press in the proofs so that customers have realistic expectations for the final packaging. Similarly certain materials, such as corrugated cardboard, add their own characteristics to the image, and these too need to be simulated.\n\n"}

It is spoken on Poluwat. \n\nPuluwatese has two dialects: Pulapese and Pulusukes, all of which have low intelligibility with Satawalese (64%), Woleaian (40%), and Ulithian (21%). Puluwatese does however have slightly higher lexical similarity with Satawalese and Carolinian (88%), Mortlockese (83%), Woleaian (82%), Chuukese (81%), and Ulithian (72%).\n\nThe syllables in Puluwatese begin with either consonants or geminal consonants followed by a vowel or geminal vowel and can be ended with either a consonant or a vowel. The different syllable structure types are as follows:\n\n\nIn the voicing of consonants, nasals, liquids, and glides are always voiced. Voiceless consonants consist of stops and fricatives and usually follow a pattern of being voiceless initially, weakly voiced medially, and voiceless at the end.\n\nPuluwatese consists of long consonants ccòwo (heavy) and short consonants ppel (light). Long consonants are considered more forceful and are often used to display an emotion such as fear. Such an example is the word for hide-and seek/ tow-the-ghost: likohhomà. In this case, the \"hh\" long consonant creates a heavy sound that is used to frighten children.\n\nAn interesting pattern in consonant replacement occurs where /w-/ and /y-/ glides replace /k-/ in some words. Some of the most commonly heard forms are as follows:\n\n\nOther consonant interchange patterns involve /c/ and /r/ which can be traced back to Trukese influence. Oftentimes, the Truk consonant /c/ and the Puluwat /r/ correspond such as in the words:\n\n\n/k/ and /kk/ may also be used interchangeably as follows:\n\n\nWhile consonant clusters do not occur in Puluwatese, there are several instances of consonant combinations occurring. These consonant combinations are often interrupted by a vowel referred to as an Excrescent. Sometimes, the intersyllabic vowel is lost and a consonant cluster can occur. The historically noted consonant combinations are as follows:\n\n\n\nVowel distribution is limited and occur finally. Vowels may present themselves as short or long and can change to a lower pitch when lengthened. While all syllables are stressed fairly evenly, stressed syllables are often denoted as capitals. The following are two rules that determine stressed syllables:\n\n\nUnstressed syllables often occur as excrescent vowels except for when they follow h- and are denoted by breves. Unstressed vowels occur in the following instances: \n\n\n\nIndependent pronouns, subject pronouns, and polite vocatives are the three types of pronouns that occur in differing distributions. Independent pronouns occur alone and in equational sentences, they precede noun or noun phrases, as well as subject pronouns, or the prepositions me, and, and with. Subject pronouns never occur as objects and always precede verbs, normally with intervening particles. The use of polite vocatives are rare in daily life and even rarer in texts. However, the known polite vocatives are included in the table below.\nThe polite vocatives that occur before a proper name may most closely be translated to Mr, Miss, or Mrs, but there are no accurate translations for the clause-final polite vocatives.\n\nIndependent and subject pronouns occur in seven propositions: first person singular (1s, 2s, 3s), first person plural inclusive (1p inc), first person plural exclusive (1p exc, 2p, 3p), and is illustrated in the table below.\nFor transitive sentences, Puluwatese follows a SVO word order but an SV or VS structure for intransitive sentences.\n\nSVO:\n\nWuŕumwo ya yákékkél-ee-ŕ yát-e-kkit mákk.\n\nWuŕumwo 3s teach-SV-3pl.obj child-EV-small writing\n\n'Wuŕumwo taught the children writing.'\n\nSV:\n\nYe-ray eŕemahán Polowat a fáyi-to.\n\none-CL manPuluwat perf come-hither\n\n'A Puluwat man has come.'\n\nVS:\n\nYe pwe le mááló manú-hmwaay we.\n\n3s T(fut) imm.fut die dem-SV-sick dem\n\n'the sick man will soon die.'\n\nNumbers in Puluwatese are confusing because there is such an intricate system of suffixes for counting different objects. In general, the base of the number stays the same and suffixes for different objects are added onto each base of the number. Suffixes that are added onto the base numbers can significantly alter the meaning of the word such as in the example ye-ray woong (a small turtle) and yee-w woong (a large turtle). For counted objects, suffixes can greatly change their meaning such as in ye-fay teŕeec (a spool of thread) and ye-met teŕeec (a piece of thread). The most common counting suffixes are outlined in the following table.\n\nSequential counting is used for rapid counting and can be combined in order to count two or three numbers without intervention. For example, \"one, two\" can be counted as yét-é-ŕúúw and \"three, four\" as yei-u-fáán. This sequential counting can be used as a system for rapid pair counting of objects such as coconuts and breadfruit.\n\nThe general suffixes are used for objects that do not have a specified suffix. Suffixes for objects are either drawn upon from the general set or any of the other sets.\n\nThe animate suffixes are applied to humans, animals, weapons, tools, musical instruments, and other miscellaneous artifacts. The animate suffixes are the only ones to have two different classifiers: -ray and -man with -man being the Trukese cognate for -mén.\n\nLong object suffixes are used for objects that are long and slender such as rope (yámeey), vehicles (citosa), and cigarettes (suupwa).\n\nRound objects suffixes are used for round objects such as stones (fawú), breadfruit (mááy), eggs (hakúll).\n\nFlat object suffixes are applied to objects such as leafs (éé), clothes (Mégaak: \"cloth\"), and mat (hááki).\n\nOrdinals follow the pattern of sequential counting with the prefixes /ya-/, /yó-/, or /yé-/, followed by the base number, and the suffix /an-/ as seen in the following table.\nThe names of the days of the week for Tuesday through Saturday are the ordinals from 2nd through 6th without the suffix /an-/. Monday is sometimes referred to as ya-ye-w (1st) and Sunday ya-féh-úw (7th), but more commonly known as, hárin fáál (ending sacredness) and ránini pin (sacred day). However, Trukese words for the names of the week are more often heard but with a Puluwat accent.\n"}

However, the negative even integers are not the only values for which the zeta function is zero. The other ones are called non-trivial zeros. The Riemann hypothesis is concerned with the locations of these non-trivial zeros, and states that:\n\nThus, if the hypothesis is correct, all the non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line consisting of the complex numbers where \"t\" is a real number and \"i\" is the imaginary unit.\n\nThere are several nontechnical books on the Riemann hypothesis, such as , , ,\n. The books , , , and give mathematical introductions, while\n, and are advanced monographs.\n\nThe Riemann zeta function is defined for complex \"s\" with real part greater than 1 by the absolutely convergent infinite series\nLeonhard Euler already considered this series in the 1730s for real values of s, in conjunction with his solution to the Basel problem. He also proved that it equals the Euler product\nwhere the infinite product extends over all prime numbers \"p\". \n\nThe Riemann hypothesis discusses zeros outside the region of convergence of this series and Euler product. To make sense of the hypothesis, it is necessary to analytically continue the function to obtain a form that is valid for all complex \"s\". This is permissble because the zeta function is meromorphic, so its analytic continuation is guaranteed to be unique and functional forms equivalent over their domains. One begins by showing that the zeta function and the Dirichlet eta function satisfy the relation\nBut the series on the right converges not just when the real part of \"s\" is greater than one, but more generally whenever \"s\" has positive real part. Thus, this alternative series extends the zeta function from to the larger domain , excluding the zeros formula_4 of formula_5 (see Dirichlet eta function). The zeta function can be extended to these values too by taking limits, giving a finite value for all values of \"s\" with positive real part except for the simple pole at \"s\" = 1.\n\nIn the strip (and everywhere else) the zeta function satisfies the functional equation\nOne may then define ζ(\"s\") for all remaining nonzero complex numbers \"s\" by applying this equation outside the strip, and letting ζ(\"s\") equal the right-hand side of the equation whenever \"s\" has non-positive real part.\n\nIf \"s\" is a negative even integer then ζ(\"s\") = 0 because the factor sin(π\"s\"/2) vanishes; these are the trivial zeros of the zeta function. (If \"s\" is a positive even integer this argument does not apply because the zeros of the sine function are cancelled by the poles of the gamma function as it takes negative integer arguments.) The value ζ(0) = −1/2 is not determined by the functional equation, but is the limiting value of ζ(\"s\") as \"s\" approaches zero. The functional equation also implies that the zeta function has no zeros with negative real part other than the trivial zeros, so all non-trivial zeros lie in the critical strip where \"s\" has real part between 0 and 1.\n\nRiemann's original motivation for studying the zeta function and its zeros was their occurrence in his explicit formula for the number of primes π(\"x\") less than a given number \"x\", which he published in his 1859 paper \"On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude\". His formula was given in terms of the related function\nwhich counts the primes and prime powers up to \"x\", counting a prime power \"p\" as 1/\"n\" of a prime. The number of primes can be recovered from this function by using the Möbius inversion formula,\nwhere \"μ\" is the Möbius function. Riemann's formula is then\n\nwhere the sum is over the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and where Π is a slightly modified version of Π that replaces its value at its points of discontinuity by the average of its upper and lower limits:\n\nThe summation in Riemann's formula is not absolutely convergent, but may be evaluated by taking the zeros ρ in order of the absolute value of their imaginary part. The function Li occurring in the first term is the (unoffset) logarithmic integral function given by the Cauchy principal value of the divergent integral\n\nThe terms Li(\"x\") involving the zeros of the zeta function need some care in their definition as Li has branch points at 0 and 1, and are defined (for \"x\" > 1) by analytic continuation in the complex variable \"ρ\" in the region Re(\"ρ\") > 0, i.e. they should be considered as . The other terms also correspond to zeros: the dominant term Li(\"x\") comes from the pole at \"s\" = 1, considered as a zero of multiplicity −1, and the remaining small terms come from the trivial zeros. For some graphs of the sums of the first few terms of this series see or .\n\nThis formula says that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function control the oscillations of primes around their \"expected\" positions. Riemann knew that the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function were symmetrically distributed about the line and he knew that all of its non-trivial zeros must lie in the range He checked that a few of the zeros lay on the critical line with real part 1/2 and suggested that they all do; this is the Riemann hypothesis.\n\nThe practical uses of the Riemann hypothesis include many propositions known true under the Riemann hypothesis, and some that can be shown to be equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.\n\nRiemann's explicit formula for the number of primes less than a given number in terms of a sum over the zeros of the Riemann zeta function says that the magnitude of the oscillations of primes around their expected position is controlled by the real parts of the zeros of the zeta function. In particular the error term in the prime number theorem is closely related to the position of the zeros. For example, if β is the upper bound of the real parts of the zeros, then the difference π(\"x\") - Li(\"x\") has the error bound O(\"x\" log(\"x\")) .\nIt is already known that 1/2 ≤ β ≤ 1 .\n\nVon Koch (1901) proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies the \"best possible\" bound for the error of the prime number theorem. A precise version of Koch's result, due to , says that the Riemann hypothesis implies\n\nwhere π(\"x\") is the prime-counting function, and log(\"x\") is the natural logarithm of \"x\".\n\nwhere ψ(\"x\") is Chebyshev's second function.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis implies strong bounds on the growth of many other arithmetic functions, in addition to the primes counting function above.\n\nOne example involves the Möbius function μ. The statement that the equation\n\nis valid for every \"s\" with real part greater than 1/2, with the sum on the right hand side converging, is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. From this we can also conclude that if the Mertens function is defined by\n\nthen the claim that\n\nfor every positive ε is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis (J.E. Littlewood, 1912; see for instance: paragraph 14.25 in ). (For the meaning of these symbols, see Big O notation.) The determinant of the order \"n\" Redheffer matrix is equal to \"M\"(\"n\"), so the Riemann hypothesis can also be stated as a condition on the growth of these determinants. The Riemann hypothesis puts a rather tight bound on the growth of \"M\", since disproved the slightly stronger Mertens conjecture\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to many other conjectures about the rate of growth of other arithmetic functions aside from μ(\"n\"). A typical example is Robin's theorem , which states that if σ(\"n\") is the divisor function, given by\n\nthen\n\nfor all \"n\" > 5040 if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true, where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.\n\nAnother example was found by Jérôme Franel, and extended by Landau (see ). The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to several statements showing that the terms of the Farey sequence are fairly regular. One such equivalence is as follows: if \"F\" is the Farey sequence of order \"n\", beginning with 1/\"n\" and up to 1/1, then the claim that for all ε > 0\n\nis equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Here\n\nis the number of terms in the Farey sequence of order \"n\".\n\nFor an example from group theory, if \"g\"(\"n\") is Landau's function given by the maximal order of elements of the symmetric group \"S\" of degree \"n\", then showed that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the bound\n\nfor all sufficiently large \"n\".\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis has various weaker consequences as well; one is the Lindelöf hypothesis on the rate of growth of the zeta function on the critical line, which says that, for any \"ε\" > 0,\n\nas \"t\" → ∞.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis also implies quite sharp bounds for the growth rate of the zeta function in other regions of the critical strip. For example, it implies that\n\nso the growth rate of ζ(1+\"it\") and its inverse would be known up to a factor of 2 .\n\nThe prime number theorem implies that on average, the gap between the prime \"p\" and its successor is log \"p\". However, some gaps between primes may be much larger than the average. Cramér proved that, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, every gap is \"O\"( log \"p\"). This is a case in which even the best bound that can be proved using the Riemann hypothesis is far weaker than what seems true: Cramér's conjecture implies that every gap is \"O\"((log \"p\")), which, while larger than the average gap, is far smaller than the bound implied by the Riemann hypothesis. Numerical evidence supports Cramér's conjecture .\n\nMany statements equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis have been found, though so far none of them have led to much progress in proving (or disproving) it. Some typical examples are as follows. (Others involve the divisor function σ(\"n\").)\n\nThe Riesz criterion was given by , to the effect that the bound\n\nholds for all ε > 0 if and only if the Riemann hypothesis holds.\n\nwhere ρ(\"z\") is the fractional part of \"z\", , and\n\nis dense in the Hilbert space \"L\"(0,1) of square-integrable functions on the unit interval. extended this by showing that the zeta function has no zeros with real part greater than 1/\"p\" if and only if this function space is dense in \"L\"(0,1)\n\nhas no non-trivial bounded solutions formula_33 for formula_34.\n\nWeil's criterion is the statement that the positivity of a certain function is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Related is Li's criterion, a statement that the positivity of a certain sequence of numbers is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.\n\nThat formula_36 has only simple zeros on the critical line is equivalent to its derivative having no zeros on the critical line.\n\nThe Farey sequence provides two equivalences, due to Jerome Franel and Edmund Landau in 1924.\n\nSeveral applications use the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet L-series or zeta functions of number fields rather than just the Riemann hypothesis. Many basic properties of the Riemann zeta function can easily be generalized to all Dirichlet L-series, so it is plausible that a method that proves the Riemann hypothesis for the Riemann zeta function would also work for the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions. Several results first proved using the generalized Riemann hypothesis were later given unconditional proofs without using it, though these were usually much harder. Many of the consequences on the following list are taken from .\n\nSome consequences of the RH are also consequences of its negation, and are thus theorems. In their discussion of the Hecke, Deuring, Mordell, Heilbronn theorem, say\n\nThe method of proof here is truly amazing. If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then the theorem is true. If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is false, then the theorem is true. Thus, the theorem is true!!     (punctuation in original)\n\nCare should be taken to understand what is meant by saying the generalized Riemann hypothesis is false: one should specify exactly which class of Dirichlet series has a counterexample.\n\nThis concerns the sign of the error in the prime number theorem.\nIt has been computed that π(\"x\") < Li(\"x\") for all \"x\" ≤ 10, and no value of \"x\" is known for which π(\"x\") > Li(\"x\"). See this table.\n\nIn 1914 Littlewood proved that there are arbitrarily large values of \"x\" for which\nand that there are also arbitrarily large values of \"x\" for which\nThus the difference π(\"x\") − Li(\"x\") changes sign infinitely many times. Skewes' number is an estimate of the value of \"x\" corresponding to the first sign change.\n\nLittlewood's proof is divided into two cases: the RH is assumed false (about half a page of ), and the RH is assumed true (about a dozen pages).\n\nThis is the conjecture (first stated in article 303 of Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae) that there are only a finite number of imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number. One way to prove it would be to show that as the discriminant \"D\" → −∞ the class number \"h\"(\"D\") → ∞.\n\nThe following sequence of theorems involving the Riemann hypothesis is described in :\n\nTheorem (Hecke; 1918). Let \"D\" < 0 be the discriminant of an imaginary quadratic number field \"K\". Assume the generalized Riemann hypothesis for \"L\"-functions of all imaginary quadratic Dirichlet characters. Then there is an absolute constant \"C\" such that\n\nTheorem (Deuring; 1933). If the RH is false then \"h\"(\"D\") > 1 if |\"D\"| is sufficiently large.\nTheorem (Mordell; 1934). If the RH is false then \"h\"(\"D\") → ∞ as \"D\" → −∞.\n\nTheorem (Heilbronn; 1934). If the generalized RH is false for the \"L\"-function of some imaginary quadratic Dirichlet character then \"h\"(\"D\") → ∞ as \"D\" → −∞.\n\nIn 1935, Carl Siegel later strengthened the result without using RH or GRH in any way.\n\nIn 1983 J. L. Nicolas proved that\n\nfor infinitely many \"n\", where φ(\"n\") is Euler's totient function and γ is Euler's constant.\n\nRibenboim remarks that:\n\nThe method of proof is interesting, in that the inequality is shown first under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true, secondly under the contrary assumption.\nThe Riemann hypothesis can be generalized by replacing the Riemann zeta function by the formally similar, but much more general, global L-functions. In this broader setting, one expects the non-trivial zeros of the global \"L\"-functions to have real part 1/2. It is these conjectures, rather than the classical Riemann hypothesis only for the single Riemann zeta function, which account for the true importance of the Riemann hypothesis in mathematics.\n\nThe generalized Riemann hypothesis extends the Riemann hypothesis to all Dirichlet L-functions. In particular it implies the conjecture that Siegel zeros (zeros of \"L\"-functions between 1/2 and 1) do not exist.\n\nThe extended Riemann hypothesis extends the Riemann hypothesis to all Dedekind zeta functions of algebraic number fields. The extended Riemann hypothesis for abelian extension of the rationals is equivalent to the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The Riemann hypothesis can also be extended to the \"L\"-functions of Hecke characters of number fields.\n\nThe grand Riemann hypothesis extends it to all automorphic zeta functions, such as Mellin transforms of Hecke eigenforms.\n\n introduced global zeta functions of (quadratic) function fields and conjectured an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for them, which has been proved by Hasse in the genus 1 case and by in general. For instance, the fact that the Gauss sum, of the quadratic character of a finite field of size \"q\" (with \"q\" odd), has absolute value formula_44 is actually an instance of the Riemann hypothesis in the function field setting. This led to conjecture a similar statement for all algebraic varieties; the resulting Weil conjectures were proved by .\n\nArithmetic zeta functions generalise the Riemann and Dedekind zeta functions as well as the zeta functions of varieties over finite fields to every arithmetic scheme or a scheme of finite type over integers. The arithmetic zeta function of a regular connected equidimensional arithmetic scheme of Kronecker dimension \"n\" can be factorized into the product of appropriately defined L-factors and an auxiliary factor . Assuming a functional equation and meromorphic continuation, the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the L-factor states that its zeros inside the critical strip formula_45 lie on the central line. Correspondingly, the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the arithmetic zeta function of a regular connected equidimensional arithmetic scheme states that its zeros inside the critical strip lie on vertical lines formula_46 and its poles inside the critical strip lie on vertical lines formula_47. This is known for schemes in positive characteristic and follows from , but remains entirely unknown in characteristic zero.\n\n introduced the Selberg zeta function of a Riemann surface. These are similar to the Riemann zeta function: they have a functional equation, and an infinite product similar to the Euler product but taken over closed geodesics rather than primes. The Selberg trace formula is the analogue for these functions of the explicit formulas in prime number theory. Selberg proved that the Selberg zeta functions satisfy the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis, with the imaginary parts of their zeros related to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator of the Riemann surface.\n\nThe Ihara zeta function of a finite graph is an analogue of the Selberg zeta function, which was first introduced by Yasutaka Ihara in the context of discrete subgroups of the two-by-two p-adic special linear group. A regular finite graph is a Ramanujan graph, a mathematical model of efficient communication networks, if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis as was pointed out by T. Sunada.\n\n suggested the pair correlation conjecture that the correlation functions of the (suitably normalized) zeros of the zeta function should be the same as those of the eigenvalues of a random hermitian matrix. showed that this is supported by large scale numerical calculations of these correlation functions.\n\nMontgomery showed that (assuming the Riemann hypothesis) at least 2/3 of all zeros are simple, and a related conjecture is that all zeros of the zeta function are simple (or more generally have no non-trivial integer linear relations between their imaginary parts). Dedekind zeta functions of algebraic number fields, which generalize the Riemann zeta function, often do have multiple complex zeros . This is because the Dedekind zeta functions factorize as a product of powers of Artin L-functions, so zeros of Artin L-functions sometimes give rise to multiple zeros of Dedekind zeta functions. Other examples of zeta functions with multiple zeros are the L-functions of some elliptic curves: these can have multiple zeros at the real point of their critical line; the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture predicts that the multiplicity of this zero is the rank of the elliptic curve.\n\nThere are many other examples of zeta functions with analogues of the Riemann hypothesis, some of which have been proved. Goss zeta functions of function fields have a Riemann hypothesis, proved by . The main conjecture of Iwasawa theory, proved by Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles for cyclotomic fields, and Wiles for totally real fields, identifies the zeros of a \"p\"-adic \"L\"-function with the eigenvalues of an operator, so can be thought of as an analogue of the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture for \"p\"-adic \"L\"-functions .\n\nSeveral mathematicians have addressed the Riemann hypothesis, but none of their attempts have yet been accepted as a correct solution. lists some incorrect solutions, and more are frequently announced.\n\nHilbert and Pólya suggested that one way to derive the Riemann hypothesis would be to find a self-adjoint operator, from the existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeros of ζ(\"s\") would follow when one applies the criterion on real eigenvalues. Some support for this idea comes from several analogues of the Riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues of some operator: the zeros of a zeta function of a variety over a finite field correspond to eigenvalues of a Frobenius element on an étale cohomology group, the zeros of a Selberg zeta function are eigenvalues of a Laplacian operator of a Riemann surface, and the zeros of a p-adic zeta function correspond to eigenvectors of a Galois action on ideal class groups.\n\nIn 1999, Michael Berry and Jonathan Keating conjectured that there is some unknown quantization formula_48 of the classical Hamiltonian \"H\" = \"xp\" so that\n\nand even more strongly, that the Riemann zeros coincide with the spectrum of the operator formula_50. This is in contrast to canonical quantization, which leads to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle formula_51 and the natural numbers as spectrum of the quantum harmonic oscillator. The crucial point is that the Hamiltonian should be a self-adjoint operator so that the quantization would be a realization of the Hilbert–Pólya program. In a connection with this quantum mechanical problem Berry and Connes had proposed that the inverse of the potential of the Hamiltonian is connected to the half-derivative of the function\n\nthen, in Berry–Connes approach\n\n. This yields a Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are the square of the imaginary part of the Riemann zeros, and also that the functional determinant of this Hamiltonian operator is just the Riemann Xi function. In fact the Riemann Xi function would be proportional to the functional determinant (Hadamard product)\n\nas proved by Connes and others, in this approach\n\nThe analogy with the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields suggests that the Hilbert space containing eigenvectors corresponding to the zeros might be some sort of first cohomology group of the spectrum Spec(Z) of the integers. described some of the attempts to find such a cohomology theory .\n\nThe Lee–Yang theorem states that the zeros of certain partition functions in statistical mechanics all lie on a \"critical line\" with their real part equals to 0, and this has led to some speculation about a relationship with the Riemann hypothesis .\n\n showed that if the functions\n\nhave no zeros when the real part of \"s\" is greater than one then\n\nwhere λ(\"n\") is the Liouville function given by (−1) if \"n\" has \"r\" prime factors. He showed that this in turn would imply that the Riemann hypothesis is true. However proved that \"T\"(\"x\") is negative for infinitely many \"x\" (and also disproved the closely related Pólya conjecture), and showed that the smallest such \"x\" is . showed by numerical calculation that the finite Dirichlet series above for \"N\"=19 has a zero with real part greater than 1. Turán also showed that a somewhat weaker assumption, the nonexistence of zeros with real part greater than 1+\"N\" for large \"N\" in the finite Dirichlet series above, would also imply the Riemann hypothesis, but showed that for all sufficiently large \"N\" these series have zeros with real part greater than . Therefore, Turán's result is vacuously true and cannot be used to help prove the Riemann hypothesis.\n\n has described a relationship between the Riemann hypothesis and noncommutative geometry, and shows that a suitable analog of the Selberg trace formula for the action of the idèle class group on the adèle class space would imply the Riemann hypothesis. Some of these ideas are elaborated in .\n\n showed that the Riemann hypothesis would follow from a positivity condition on a certain Hilbert space of entire functions.\nHowever showed that the necessary positivity conditions are not satisfied. Despite this obstacle, de Branges has continued to work on an attempted proof of the Riemann hypothesis along the same lines, but this has not been widely accepted by other mathematicians .\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis implies that the zeros of the zeta function form a quasicrystal, meaning a distribution with discrete support whose Fourier transform also has discrete support.\n\nWhen one goes from geometric dimension one, e.g. an algebraic number field, to geometric dimension two, e.g. a regular model of an elliptic curve over a number field, the two-dimensional part of the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the arithmetic zeta function of the model deals with the poles of the zeta function. In dimension one the study of the zeta integral in Tate's thesis does not lead to new important information on the Riemann hypothesis. Contrary to this, in dimension two work of Ivan Fesenko on two-dimensional generalisation of Tate's thesis includes an integral representation of a zeta integral closely related to the zeta function. In this new situation, not possible in dimension one, the poles of the zeta function can be studied via the zeta integral and associated adele groups. Related conjecture of on the positivity of the fourth derivative of a boundary function associated to the zeta integral essentially implies the pole part of the generalized Riemann hypothesis. proved that the latter, together with some technical assumptions, implies Fesenko's conjecture.\n\nDeligne's proof of the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields used the zeta functions of product varieties, whose zeros and poles correspond to sums of zeros and poles of the original zeta function, in order to bound the real parts of the zeros of the original zeta function. By analogy, introduced multiple zeta functions whose zeros and poles correspond to sums of zeros and poles of the Riemann zeta function. To make the series converge he restricted to sums of zeros or poles all with non-negative imaginary part. So far, the known bounds on the zeros and poles of the multiple zeta functions are not strong enough to give useful estimates for the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nThe functional equation combined with the argument principle implies that the number of zeros of the zeta function with imaginary part between 0 and \"T\" is given by\nfor \"s\"=1/2+i\"T\", where the argument is defined by varying it continuously along the line with Im(\"s\")=\"T\", starting with argument 0 at ∞+i\"T\". This is the sum of a large but well understood term\nand a small but rather mysterious term\nSo the density of zeros with imaginary part near \"T\" is about log(\"T\")/2π, and the function \"S\" describes the small deviations from this. The function \"S\"(\"t\") jumps by 1 at each zero of the zeta function, and for it decreases monotonically between zeros with derivative close to −log \"t\".\n\nKaratsuba (1996) proved that every interval (\"T\", \"T\"+\"H\"] for formula_61 contains at least\npoints where the function \"S\"(\"t\") changes sign.\n\nThis suggests that \"S\"(\"T\")/(log log \"T\") resembles a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance 2π ( proved this fact).\nIn particular |\"S\"(\"T\")| is usually somewhere around (log log \"T\"), but occasionally much larger. The exact order of growth of \"S\"(\"T\") is not known. There has been no unconditional improvement to Riemann's original bound \"S\"(\"T\")=O(log \"T\"), though the Riemann hypothesis implies the slightly smaller bound \"S\"(\"T\")=O(log \"T\"/log log \"T\") . The true order of magnitude may be somewhat less than this, as random functions with the same distribution as \"S\"(\"T\") tend to have growth of order about log(\"T\"). In the other direction it cannot be too small: showed that , and assuming the Riemann hypothesis Montgomery showed that .\n\nNumerical calculations confirm that \"S\" grows very slowly: |\"S\"(\"T\")| < 1 for , |\"S\"(\"T\")| < 2 for \"T\" < , and the largest value of |\"S\"(\"T\")| found so far is not much larger than 3 .\n\nRiemann's estimate \"S\"(\"T\") = O(log \"T\") implies that the gaps between zeros are bounded, and Littlewood improved this slightly, showing that the gaps between their imaginary parts tends to 0.\n\n and independently proved that no zeros could lie on the line Re(\"s\") = 1. Together with the functional equation and the fact that there are no zeros with real part greater than 1, this showed that all non-trivial zeros must lie in the interior of the critical strip . This was a key step in their first proofs of the prime number theorem.\n\nBoth the original proofs that the zeta function has no zeros with real part 1 are similar, and depend on showing that if ζ(1+\"it\") vanishes, then ζ(1+2\"it\") is singular, which is not possible. One way of doing this is by using the inequality\nfor σ > 1, \"t\" real, and looking at the limit as σ → 1. This inequality follows by taking the real part of the log of the Euler product to see that\nwhere the sum is over all prime powers \"p\", so that\nwhich is at least 1 because all the terms in the sum are positive, due to the inequality\n\nDe la Vallée-Poussin (1899–1900) proved that if is a zero of the Riemann zeta function, then for some positive constant \"C\". In other words, zeros cannot be too close to the line there is a zero-free region close to this line. This zero-free region has been enlarged by several authors using methods such as Vinogradov's mean-value theorem. gave a version with explicit numerical constants: whenever |\"t\" | ≥ 3 and\n\n and showed there are infinitely many zeros on the critical line, by considering moments of certain functions related to the zeta function. proved that at least a (small) positive proportion of zeros lie on the line. improved this to one-third of the zeros by relating the zeros of the zeta function to those of its derivative, and improved this further to two-fifths.\n\nMost zeros lie close to the critical line. More precisely, showed that for any positive ε, all but an infinitely small proportion of zeros lie within a distance ε of the critical line. gives several more precise versions of this result, called \"zero density estimates\", which bound the number of zeros in regions with imaginary part at most \"T\" and real part at least 1/2+ε.\n\nIn 1914 Godfrey Harold Hardy proved that formula_69 has infinitely many real zeros.\n\nLet \"N\"(\"T\") be the total number of real zeros, formula_70 be the total number of zeros of odd order of the function\nlying on the interval (0, \"T\"].\n\nThe next two conjectures of Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood on the distance between real zeros of formula_69 and on the density of zeros of formula_69 on intervals (\"T\", \"T\"+\"H\"] for sufficiently large \"T\" > 0, formula_74 and with as less as possible value of \"a\" > 0, where ε > 0 is an arbitrarily small number, open two new directions in the investigation of the Riemann zeta function:\n\n1. for any ε > 0 there exists formula_75 such that for formula_76 and formula_77 the interval formula_78 contains a zero of odd order of the function formula_79.\n\n2. for any ε > 0 there exist formula_75 and \"c\" = \"c\"(ε) > 0, such that for formula_76 and formula_82 the inequality formula_83 is true.\n\n investigated the problem of Hardy–Littlewood 2 and proved that for any ε > 0 there exists such formula_75 and \"c\" = \"c\"(ε) > 0, such that for formula_76 and formula_82 the inequality formula_87 is true. Selberg conjectured that this could be tightened to formula_88. proved that for a fixed ε satisfying the condition 0 < ε < 0.001, a sufficiently large \"T\" and formula_89, formula_90, the interval (\"T\", \"T\"+\"H\") contains at least \"cH\"ln(\"T\") real zeros of the Riemann zeta function formula_69 and therefore confirmed the Selberg conjecture. The estimates of Selberg and Karatsuba can not be improved in respect of the order of growth as \"T\" → ∞.\n\nThe function\n\nhas the same zeros as the zeta function in the critical strip, and is real on the critical line because of the functional equation, so one can prove the existence of zeros exactly on the real line between two points by checking numerically that the function has opposite signs at these points. Usually one writes\n\nwhere Hardy's function \"Z\" and the Riemann–Siegel theta function θ are uniquely defined by this and the condition that they are smooth real functions with θ(0)=0.\nBy finding many intervals where the function \"Z\" changes sign one can show that there are many zeros on the critical line. To verify the Riemann hypothesis up to a given imaginary part \"T\" of the zeros, one also has to check that there are no further zeros off the line in this region. This can be done by calculating the total number of zeros in the region and checking that it is the same as the number of zeros found on the line. This allows one to verify the Riemann hypothesis computationally up to any desired value of \"T\" (provided all the zeros of the zeta function in this region are simple and on the critical line).\n\nSome calculations of zeros of the zeta function are listed below. So far all zeros that have been checked are on the critical line and are simple. (A multiple zero would cause problems for the zero finding algorithms, which depend on finding sign changes between zeros.) For tables of the zeros, see or .\nA Gram point is a point on the critical line 1/2 + \"it\" where the zeta function is real and non-zero. Using the expression for the zeta function on the critical line, ζ(1/2 + \"it\") = \"Z\"(\"t\")e, where Hardy's function, \"Z\", is real for real \"t\", and θ is the Riemann–Siegel theta function, we see that zeta is real when sin(θ(\"t\")) = 0. This implies that θ(\"t\") is an integer multiple of π, which allows for the location of Gram points to be calculated fairly easily by inverting the formula for θ. They are usually numbered as \"g\" for \"n\" = 0, 1, ..., where \"g\" is the unique solution of θ(\"t\") = \"n\"π.\n\nGram observed that there was often exactly one zero of the zeta function between any two Gram points; Hutchinson called this observation Gram's law. There are several other closely related statements that are also sometimes called Gram's law: for example, (−1)\"Z\"(\"g\") is usually positive, or \"Z\"(\"t\") usually has opposite sign at consecutive Gram points. The imaginary parts γ of the first few zeros (in blue) and the first few Gram points \"g\" are given in the following table\n\nA Gram point \"t\" is called good if the zeta function is positive at 1/2 + \"it\". The indices of the \"bad\" Gram points where \"Z\" has the \"wrong\" sign are 126, 134, 195, 211, ... . A Gram block is an interval bounded by two good Gram points such that all the Gram points between them are bad. A refinement of Gram's law called Rosser's rule due to says that Gram blocks often have the expected number of zeros in them (the same as the number of Gram intervals), even though some of the individual Gram intervals in the block may not have exactly one zero in them. For example, the interval bounded by \"g\" and \"g\" is a Gram block containing a unique bad Gram point \"g\", and contains the expected number 2 of zeros although neither of its two Gram intervals contains a unique zero. Rosser et al. checked that there were no exceptions to Rosser's rule in the first 3 million zeros, although there are infinitely many exceptions to Rosser's rule over the entire zeta function.\n\nGram's rule and Rosser's rule both say that in some sense zeros do not stray too far from their expected positions. The distance of a zero from its expected position is controlled by the function \"S\" defined above, which grows extremely slowly: its average value is of the order of (log log \"T\"), which only reaches 2 for T around 10. This means that both rules hold most of the time for small \"T\" but eventually break down often. Indeed, showed that both Gram's law and Rosser's rule fail in a positive proportion of cases. To be specific, it is expected that in about 73% one zero is enclosed by two successive Gram points, but in 14% no zero and in 13% two zeros are in such a Gram-interval on the long run.\n\nMathematical papers about the Riemann hypothesis tend to be cautiously noncommittal about its truth. Of authors who express an opinion, most of them, such as or , imply that they expect (or at least hope) that it is true.

The consensus of the survey articles (, , and ) is that the evidence for it is strong but not overwhelming, so that while it is probably true there is some reasonable doubt about it.\n\nSome of the arguments for (or against) the Riemann hypothesis are listed by , , and , and include the following reasons.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the author of numerous dictionaries, grammars, poems and short stories. He also founded \"Gwalarn\", a literary journal in Breton where many young authors published their first writings during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nHemon served in the French Army at the beginning of the Second World War, where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans.\n\nBack in Brest in August 1940, he took back publishing \"Gwalarn\". In November 1940, he was appointed as director of programmes at \"Radio Roazhon-Breizh\", a Breton language weekly broadcast set up by the \"Propagandastaffel\". From 1941, he directed the weekly publication \"Arvor\". In October 1942, Hemon was appointed by Leo Weisgerber to help found the \"Celtic Institute of Brittany\". Hemon rendered other services to the Germans, like helping in compiling files against \"préfet\" Ripert.\n\nAt the Liberation, Hemon fled to Germany, where he was imprisoned. After one year of jail he was sentenced by the French state to ten years of \"dégradation nationale\" for the offence of \"Indignité nationale\". He decided therefore to go in exile to Ireland. He worked there for the Institute for Advanced Studies. He would never go back to Brittany. Despite all this he never stopped working for the Breton language, and wrote for instance \"A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton\" in 1975. He created the magazine \"Ar Bed Keltiek\" that resembled \"Kannadig Gwalarn\" or \"Arvor\". He died in 1978. He was buried in Brest.\n\nHemon's reputation as a scholar led to the naming of institutions in Brittany after him. In 2000 controversy erupted over this, as Hemon's role in the war was publicised. Some of his statements made at the time were disinterred, particularly anti-French opinions expressed in \"Ni hon unan\". As a result, the school Diwan in Le Relecq-Kerhuon, and the Cultural centre of Guingamp, which had been named after Hemon, had to change names.\n"}

He was regarded as one of the 20th century's leading scholars in both fields.\n\nAfghani was born in Damascus in 1911 to a Afghan father and Syrian mother. Having been born in an Arab country, Afghani spoke the language as his mother tongue and was eventually appointed to the position of professor of the Arabic language and later dean of the faculty of arts at the University of Damascus. He also taught at universities in Jordan, Libya and Saudi Arabia. Afghani died on February 18th, 1997 in Mecca, where he was buried.\n\nAfghani's most well-known work is \"al-Mujaz\", a book attempting to simplify Arabic grammar for those unfamiliar with the language. He was a strong supporter of reforming the way in which Arabic grammar was understood and taught, blaming traditionalists and their opposition to any reform for the failure of language education in Arab countries. In Afghani's view, opposition from traditionalists such as the Arab Academy of Damascus stifled efforts of reform-minded bodies such as the Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo. Afghani was instrumental in the founding of Al-Arabi, a magazine showcasing the arts and culture of the Arab World.\n\nAfghani also spent ten years composing a biography of Aisha, the Muslim prophet Muhammad's second or third wife; the book was noted for Afghani's views on women in Islam, which Moroccan feminist writer Fatema Mernissi described as representative of all the Muslim world's most conservative views. Afghani was also learned in the field of Islamic studies, devoting much attention to the aspects of Muslim jurisprudence. On both language and religion, he wrote very little, seeing that books should only be written if there was a clear need for research on the given topic. Being a follower of the Zahirite school of Islamic law, Afghani devoted much attention to preserving and commenting on the works of Ibn Hazm, one of the school's champions. Afghani's 1960 published edition of Ibn Hazm's \"Mulakhkhas\", an important work of Zahirite legal theory, is considered a key moment in Arab intellectual history and the modernist revival of Ibn Hazm's legal method. In Hadith studies, Afghani was a student of Habib Al-Rahman Al-Azmi.\n\n\n"}

According to studies in the psychology of human error to improve medicine and business, a person may inadvertently perform one action while intending to do another.\n\nThe term \"slips and capture\" became more widely known in the early 21st century in the United States, after being referred to by law enforcement in two prominent fatal police shooting cases in 2009 and 2015. In both cases, the police officer claimed to have shot a suspect while intending to use a Taser.\n\nThe concept of \"slips and capture\" has been studied in the psychology of human error, and efforts to prevent error. It was thoroughly described in 1990 by James Reason.\n\nThe concept has been addressed in efforts to improve business, including computer and program design, and medical practices in order to avoid preventable error. Both terms are used in error terminology: slips are defined as \"errors in the performance of skill-based behaviors, typically when our attention is diverted;\" and capture refers to \"a type of slip where a more frequent and more practiced behavior takes place when a similar, but less familiar, action was intended.\"\n\nEarly on New Year's Day of 2009, Oscar Grant III was fatally shot by Bay Area Rapid Transit officer Johannes Mehserle, who was detaining the young man with others after a reported fight on the train. At his bail hearing in late January 2009, Mehserle said that he had intended to use his Taser, but inadvertently grabbed his pistol instead. In 2010 a jury convicted Mehserle of involuntary manslaughter, acquitting him of charges of voluntary manslaughter.\n\nThe phrase \"slips and capture\" was used by Bill Lewinski in 2009, a consultant in police use of force who was part of Mehserle's defense team. Lewinski was reported by the \"Wall Street Journal\" to have a doctorate in psychology from Union Institute & University, an online college. His company, Force Science Institute, specializes in consulting to police departments. Its website advertises: \"We save lives and reputations.\" Lewinski published a newsletter article on the \"Slips and Capture\" theory in his \"Force Science News #154\" after he began work on the defense of Mehserle.\n\n44-year-old Eric Courtney Harris was shot to death April 2, 2015 by Tulsa city police during an undercover sting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As Harris was being subdued, Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Charles \"Bob\" Bates, 73, fatally shot Harris in the back, according to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office. Bates used the concept of \"slips and capture\" in his defense, saying that he had intended to use his Taser on Harris.\n\nDuring a CNN interview in 2015, after this term was used by the Tulsa Police Department in reference to the fatal shooting of Eric Courtney Harris, a criminal justice expert said that there was no scientific basis for the theory of \"slip and capture\". He said most courts would reject the argument as inadmissible.\n"}

Although the label is used by and reserved almost exclusively for gay and bisexual men, it may also be used to describe a lesbian or bisexual woman exhibiting a feminine appearance and mannerisms. Because the term invokes negative stereotypes of gay people, its application is often controversial and may cause offense.\n\nCommunication Scholar, Shinsuke Eguchi (2009) proposes to explain the emergence of the straight acting phenomenon \"because some gay men want to achieve hegemonic masculinity to overcome gay effeminate images\". Both Eguchi and Tim Berling relate it to the general context of sissyphobia—the dominant cultural norm that disparages effeminate men, which is not restricted to the gay culture. In \"Negotiating Sisyphobia: A critical/ interpretive analysis of one ‘femme’ gay Asian body in the heteronormative world,\" Shinsuke Eguchi (2011) writes, \"I began to see that the discursive manifestation of sissyphobia is not that feminine gay men are unattractive and undesirable. Rather, these straight-acting gay men would like to present their “heteronormative” masculine faces in their social interactions with others\" (p. 50).\n\nSex advice columnist Dan Savage commented on the popularity of the term \"straight-acting\" in gay personal ads, criticizing both the practice and the idea that a man seeking a gay relationship through a gay personal ad is acting straight. Defenders of the term maintain it refers merely to one's mannerisms and that critics' isolation of the word \"acting\" in the phrase distorts the intended meaning of the phrase. Use of the term itself has been labeled as damaging to the LGBT community, as it associates certain attributes with homosexuality.\n\nMen who use the expression \"straight-acting\" may express resentment that critics claim the term implies they are acting and not being their true selves.\n\nQueers United Against Straight Acting Homosexuals (QUASH) was the organization in Chicago that published a often cited article in their newsletter in 1993. . Titled; \"Assimilation is Killing Us Fight For a Queer United Front.\" The article calls for a new order in our gendered social systems to be inclusive and not exclude anyone from liberation, challenging the power and privilege of the dominant members of society. An article similar to \"Assimilation is Killing Us\", published a year later, entitled, QUASH, still standing for Queers United Against Straight-Acting Homosexuals, used the same concept of rejection of the established gendered protocols, specifically, that there can be varied and better institutions than couple hood and marriage.\nThese were early challenges to heteronormativity; ways of thinking outside the dominant culture's definitions of gender.\n\nFilmmaker Spencer Windes explored the term and the definition of masculinity in his film \"Straight Acting.\" The film is a documentary about Windes' transformation from a closeted Mormon missionary into an openly gay man, through his involvement in the subculture of gays who play contact sports.\n\nA Reddit community called \"Gay Bros\" was initiated in 2011.\n\n"}

{"id": "61398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61398", "title": "Superpower", "text": "Superpower\n\nSuperpower is a term used to describe a state with a dominant position, which is characterised by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale. This is done through the combined-means of economic, military, technological and cultural strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence. Traditionally, superpowers are preeminent among the great powers.\n\nThe term was first applied post World War II to the British Empire, the United States and the Soviet Union. However, after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis in 1956, the United Kingdom's status as a superpower was greatly diminished, leaving just the United States and Soviet Union as superpowers. For the duration of the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union came to be generally regarded as the two remaining superpowers, dominating world affairs. At the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, only the United States appeared to fulfill the criteria of being a world superpower.\n\nAlice Lyman Miller defines a superpower as \"a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world, and sometimes, in more than one region of the globe at a time, and so may plausibly attain the status of global hegemony.\"\n\nNo agreed definition of what is a 'superpower' exists, and may differ between sources. However, a fundamental characteristic that is consistent with all definitions of a superpower is a nation or state that has mastered the seven dimensions of state power: geography, population, economy, resources, military, diplomacy and national identity.\n\nThe term was first used to describe nations with greater than great power status as early as 1944, but only gained its specific meaning with regard to the United States, the United Kingdom and its empire and the Soviet Union after World War II. This was because the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union had proved themselves to be capable of casting great influence in global politics and military dominance. The term in its current political meaning was coined by Dutch-American geostrategist Nicholas Spykman in a series of lectures in 1943 about the potential shape of a new post-war world order. This formed the foundation for the book \"The Geography of the Peace\", which referred primarily to the unmatched maritime global supremacy of the British Empire and United States as essential for peace and prosperity in the world.\n\nA year later, in 1944, William T. R. Fox, an American foreign policy professor, elaborated on the concept in the book \"The Superpowers: The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union — Their Responsibility for Peace\", which spoke of the global reach of a super-empowered nation. Fox used the word Superpower to identify a new category of power able to occupy the highest status in a world in which, as the war then raging demonstrated, states could challenge and fight each other on a global scale. According to him, there were (at that moment) three states that were superpowers: the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The British Empire was the most extensive empire in world history and considered the foremost great power, holding sway over 25% of the world's population and controlling about 25% of the Earth's total land area, while the United States and the Soviet Union grew in power before and during World War II.\n\nAccording to Lyman Miller, \"The basic components of superpower stature may be measured along four axes of power: military, economic, political, and cultural (or what political scientist Joseph Nye has termed “soft power”)\".\n\nIn the opinion of Kim Richard Nossal of Queen's University in Canada, \"generally this term was used to signify a political community that occupied a continental-sized landmass, had a sizable population (relative at least to other major powers); a superordinate economic capacity, including ample indigenous supplies of food and natural resources; enjoyed a high degree of non-dependence on international intercourse; and, most importantly, had a well-developed nuclear capacity (eventually normally defined as second strike capability).\"\n\nIn the opinion of Professor Paul Dukes, \"a superpower must be able to conduct a global strategy including the possibility of destroying the world; to command vast economic potential and influence; and to present a universal ideology\". Although, \"many modifications may be made to this basic definition\". According to Professor June Teufel Dreyer, \"A superpower must be able to project its power, soft and hard, globally.\" In his book, \"\", Dr. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, argues that a superpower is \"a country that can exert enough military, political, and economic power to persuade nations in every region of the world to take important actions they would not otherwise take.\"\n\nThere have been many attempts by historians to apply the term superpower retrospectively, and sometimes very loosely, to a variety of entities in the past. Recognition by historians of these older states as superpowers may focus on various superlative traits exhibited by them. Examples of these ancient or historical superpowers include the British Empire, Ancient Egypt, the Hittite Empire, the Median Empire, the Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian Empire, the Sassanian Empire, the Safavid Empire, the Afsharid Empire, the Hellenistic Empire of Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, the Maurya Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Russian Empire, the Han Empire, the Tang Empire,the Rashidun Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Mongol Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Spanish Empire, and the First French Empire of Napoleon.\n\nAccording to historical statistics and research from the OECD, until the early modern period, Western Europe, China, and India accounted for roughly ⅔ of the world's GDP.\n\nThe 1956 Suez Crisis suggested that Britain, financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue its foreign policy objectives on an equal footing with the new superpowers without sacrificing convertibility of its reserve currency as a central goal of policy. As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in Europe or Asia. The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world's largest long-term creditor nation and its principal supplier of goods; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage. Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the United Nations), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like, and after the withdrawal of British aid to Greece in 1947, the United States took the lead in containing Soviet expansion in the Cold War.\n\nThe two countries opposed each other ideologically, politically, militarily, and economically. The Soviet Union promoted the ideology of communism: planned economy and a one-party state, whilst the United States promoted the ideologies of liberal democracy and the free market. This was reflected in the Warsaw Pact and NATO military alliances, respectively, as most of Europe became aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. These alliances implied that these two nations were part of an emerging bipolar world, in contrast with a previously multipolar world. \n\nThe idea that the Cold War period revolved around only two blocs, or even only two nations, has been challenged by some scholars in the post–Cold War era, who have noted that the bipolar world only exists if one ignores all of the various movements and conflicts that occurred without influence from either of the two superpowers. Additionally, much of the conflict between the superpowers was fought in \"proxy wars\", which more often than not involved issues more complex than the standard Cold War oppositions.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s, the term hyperpower began to be applied to the United States, as the sole remaining superpower of the Cold War era. This term, popularized by French foreign minister Hubert Védrine in the late 1990s, is controversial and the validity of classifying the United States in this way is disputed. One notable opponent to this theory, Samuel P. Huntington, rejects this theory in favor of a multipolar balance of power. Other international relations theorists, such as Henry Kissinger, theorize that because the threat of the Soviet Union no longer exists to formerly American-dominated regions such as Western Europe and Japan, American influence is only declining since the end of the Cold War, because such regions no longer need protection or have necessarily similar foreign policies as the United States.\n\nThe Soviet Union and the United States fulfilled the superpower criteria in the following ways:\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 which ended the Cold War, the post–Cold War world has in the past been considered by some to be a unipolar world, with the United States as the world's sole remaining superpower. In 1999, Samuel P. Huntington wrote, \"The United States, of course, is the sole state with preeminence in every domain of power – economic, military, diplomatic, ideological, technological, and cultural – with the reach and capabilities to promote its interests in virtually every part of the world.\" However, he rejected the claim that the world was unipolar: \"There is now only one superpower. But that does not mean that the world is unipolar,\" describing it instead as \"a strange hybrid, a uni-multipolar system with one superpower and several major powers.\" He further wrote that \"Washington is blind to the fact that it no longer enjoys the dominance it had at the end of the Cold War. It must relearn the game of international politics as a major power, not a superpower, and make compromises.\"\n\nExperts argue that this older assessment of global politics is too simplified, in part because of the difficulty in classifying the European Union at its current stage of development. Others argue that the notion of a superpower is outdated, considering complex global economic interdependencies, and propose that the world is multipolar.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Intelligence Council said that America's superpower status will have eroded to merely being first among equals by 2030, but that the US would remain highest among the world's most powerful countries because of its influence in many different fields and global connections that the great regional powers of the time would not match. Additionally, some experts have suggested the possibility of the United States losing its superpower status completely in the future. Citing speculation of the United States relative decline in power to the rest of the world, economic hardships, a declining dollar, Cold War allies becoming less dependent on the United States and the emergence of future powers around the world.\n\nSome people doubt the existence of superpowers in the post–Cold War era altogether, stating that today's complex global marketplace and the rising interdependency between the world's nations has made the concept of a superpower an idea of the past and that the world is now multipolar. However, while the military dominance of the United States remains unquestioned for now and its international influence has made it an eminent world power, countries such as China, India, Brazil and Russia are inventing new ways to counter US military supremacy (namely space) and are making great strides in science, literature, soft power, and diplomacy.\n\nThe term 'potential superpowers' has been applied by scholars and other qualified commentators to the possibility of several states achieving superpower status in the 21st century. Due to their large markets, growing military strength, economic potential, and influence in international affairs, China, the European Union, India, and Russia are among the political entities most cited as having the potential of achieving superpower status in the 21st century. Many historians, writers, and critics have expressed doubts, however, whether any of these countries would ever emerge as a new superpower. Some political scientists and other commentators have even suggested that such countries might simply be emerging powers, as opposed to potential superpowers.\n\nBesides those mentioned above, a limited number of observers have also discussed, though ultimately dismissed, Brazil having the potential to emerge as a superpower.\n\nThe record of such predictions has admittedly not been perfect. For example, in the 1980s, some commentators thought Japan would become a superpower, due to its large GDP and high economic growth at the time. However, Japan's economy crashed in 1991, creating a long period of economic slump in the country which has become known as \"The Lost Years\". As of August 2012, Japan had yet to fully recover from the 1991 crash.\n\n\n"}

Although it is unknown when the term was coined, it makes an analogy with heat sink.\n\nIn massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), time sinks are a method of increasing the time needed by players to do certain tasks, hopefully causing them to subscribe for longer periods of time. Players may use the term disparagingly to describe a simplistic and time-consuming aspect of gameplay, possibly designed to keep players playing longer without significant benefit. Time sinks can also be used for other gameplay reasons, such as to help regenerate resources or monsters in the game world.\n\nMany players consider time sinks to be an inherently poor design decision, only included so that game companies can increase profits. For example, one Slashdot article describes time sinks as \"gameplay traps intended to waste your time and keep you playing longer\". In most games, boring and lengthy parts of gameplay are merely an annoyance, but when used in subscription-based MMORPGs, where players are paying recurring fees for access to the game, they become a much more inflammatory issue. Game designers must be prudent in balancing efforts to produce both involving gameplay and the length of content that players expect.\n\nTime sinks are often associated with hardcore games, though whether this is a positive or negative association depends on the context.\n\nImplementing time sinks in a video game is a delicate balancing act. Excessive use of time sinks may cause players to stop playing. However, if not enough time sinks are implemented, players may feel the game is too short or too easy, causing them to abandon the game much sooner out of boredom. A number of criteria can be used to evaluate use of time sinks, such as frequency, length, and variety (both of the nature of the time sink and the actions taken to overcome it). What is considered a good balance depends in part on the type of game in question. Casual games are often expected to have less in the way of time sinks, and hardcore games to have more, though this is not a hard and fast rule.\n\n\n"}
