Constraint Grammar taggers are also used for some language pairs (e.g. Breton-French).\n\nExisting machine translation systems available at present are mostly commercial or use proprietary technologies, which makes them very hard to adapt to new usages; furthermore, they use different technologies across language pairs, which makes it very difficult, for instance, to integrate them in a single multilingual content management system.\n\nApertium uses a language-independent specification, to allow for the ease of contributing to Apertium, more efficient development, and enhancing the project's overall growth.\n\nAt present, Apertium has released 40 stable language pairs, delivering fast translation with reasonably intelligible results (errors are easily corrected). Being an open-source project, Apertium provides tools for potential developers to build their own language pair and contribute to the project.\n\nApertium originated as one of the machine translation engines in the project OpenTrad, which was funded by the Spanish government, and developed by the Transducens research group at the Universitat d'Alacant. It was originally designed to translate between closely related languages, although it has recently been expanded to treat more divergent language pairs. To create a new machine translation system, one just has to develop linguistic data (dictionaries, rules) in well-specified XML formats.\n\nLanguage data developed for it (in collaboration with the Universidade de Vigo, the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and the Universitat Pompeu Fabra) currently support (in stable version) Arabic, Aragonese, Asturian, Basque, Breton, Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, English, Esperanto, French, Galician, Hindi, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Kazakh, Macedonian, Malaysian, Maltese, Northern Sami, Norwegian (Bokmål and Nynorsk), Occitan, Portuguese, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Tatar, Urdu, and Welsh languages.

This was later revised and published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1909.\n\nAnother complete translation from Hebrew and Greek was started in 1923. It was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society and translated by Charles Edward Garrad, William Sherratt and George Kya Bin. It is generally believed to have been completed in 1926 and published in 1927. It is claimed to be mainly used within the Anglican denomination.\n\nThe New Testament might be a revision of the U Tun Nyein translation.\n\nGarrad continued to document corrections to this translation after its publication.

In 1901 he appeared for the first time at the newly dedicated folk park in Norrköping. He took part in local revues there for many years, and was on the folk park circuit until the end of the 1940s. A long-term contract enabled him to become one of Sweden's most prolific recording artists with over two hundred sides to his credit. His motto was: \"Above all else, be original!\" \n\nCalle Lindström had perhaps the most varied background of any peasant comic. Born in 1868, in his youth he was a circus artist, who worked in every facet of the entertainment industry. The concertina was his instrument as he regaled audiences despite missing four fingers on his right hand — he had to turn the instrument upside down and hide the disfigured hand with a handkerchief. He sometimes used a method of presentation called the \"tintamarresque theater\". A common practice in Swedish variety halls, the performer would stand behind a photographed foreground and slip his head through an opening in the picture for comic effect.\n\nLindström's 1908 recording of \"Chikago\" achieved popularity on both sides of the Atlantic. The song, whose music and lyrics he wrote, has been recorded by many artists since then and published in Swedish and American songbooks.\n\nChicago was one of the major urban centers for Swedish immigrants. Lasse from Ossebo, the character in the song, has heard many marvelous things about Chicago from his brother who lives there. He is impressed by the stockyards and the elevated railway, but perhaps even more by the fact that \"at night it's just like daytime, there are so many lights\" — and \"everybody smokes cigars instead of chewing snuff.\" Lasse decides to go there himself: \"And there I'll make my fortune and be a proper gent. Good-bye to each and all of you, it's time now that I went!\" \n\nThe humorist Albert Engström coined the word \"Grönköping\" in 1895 as a caption for some of his drawings, thereby inventing the fictional Swedish town of the same name. In 2002 the CD \"Grönköping Tar Ton\" was issued in Sweden to commemorate one hundred years of \"Grönköpings Veckoblad\" (Grönköping's Weekly), a satirical monthly magazine that was founded in 1902. The album, depicting Grönköping in recordings made between 1908 and 1946, has two recordings by Calle Lindström .\n\nCalle Lindström never visited the United States, but some of his songs and stories made the journey. Several of his recordings were repackaged for the American market and issued on Victor Records. Songs such as \"Sven Svenssons Sven\" and \"Josefin mä symaskin\" (Josefin with the sewing machine) were recorded in New York City by other Swedish-born artists. In 1972 the Swedish actor John Harryson released cover versions of two songs written by Lindström. More than a half century after his death there continues to be interest in Lindström's recordings, which are sold in the original vinyl format and as digital downloads or posted on video-sharing websites.\n\n\n\nImage files\nSelected recordings (Sweden)\nSwedish discography\nSelected recordings (America)\nSong lyrics\nSongbook\nStreaming audio\n"}
{"id": "10820533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10820533", "title": "Chinese typewriter", "text": "Chinese typewriter\n\nA Chinese typewriter is a typewriter that can type Chinese script. Early European typewriters began appearing in the early 19th century. However, as the Chinese language uses a logographic writing system, fitting thousands of Chinese characters on the machine needed much more complex engineering than typewriters using a simple latin alphabet, or other non-logographic scripts. An ordinary Chinese printing office uses 6,000 Chinese characters. Chinese typewriters, and similar Japanese typewriters invented by Kyota Sugimoto, which use kanji adopted from the Chinese writing system, started to appear only in the early 20th century. There have been at least five dozen different versions of Chinese typewriters, ranging from sizable mechanical models to sophisticated electric word processors.\n\nHou-Kun Chow (), a mechanical engineer in Shanghai, is credited with inventing the first Chinese typewriter in 1916. His typewriter utilized 4,000 characters. He had studied in the United States like several other Chinese who also contributed to the development of Chinese typewriters. Chow first thought about the practicality of a Chinese typewriter in Boston, while he was inspecting American typewriters as a student of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His efforts were initially hindered by a lack of technical assistance in Shanghai.\n\nChow considered it impossible to build a Chinese typewriter with separate keys for each Chinese character. The solution was a mechanical typewriter using a revolving cylinder to fit Chinese characters on the machine. They were ordered by radicals and number of strokes on the cylinder, in a manner similar to Chinese dictionaries. This design however proved heavy, the machine initially weighing at and an improved version at about .\n\nChow expected his typewriter to be used in Chinese offices where multiple copies of documents would be required to be made, and by Chinese living in foreign countries due to their lack of access to the services of skilled writers familiar with Chinese characters.\n\nChinese typewriters made in Japan entered the market in the 1920s, with the \"Wanneng\" () brand introduced by the Nippon Typewriter Company in 1940 during the Second Sino-Japanese War becoming the \"de facto\" standard. After Japan's defeat and the subsequent nationalization of typewriter companies by the Communist government, locally made models based on the \"Wanneng\" continued to dominate the market, particularly the \"Double Pigeon\" ().\n\nThe Ming Kwai typewriter is an electromechanical typewriter invented and patented by Lin Yutang. The patent, No. 2613795, was filed on April 17, 1946 by Lin, and was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on October 14, 1952. One of Lin's intentions was to help modernize China. Lin called his design the \"Ming Kwai\" typewriter and promoted it as \"The Only Chinese Typewriter Designed for Everybody's Use\". The two Chinese characters \"Ming kwai\" () means \"clear\" (as in understandable) and \"quick\".\n\nLin had a prototype machine custom built by the Carl E. Krum Company, a small engineering-design consulting firm with an office in New York City. That multilingual typewriter was the size of a conventional office typewriter of the 1940s. It measured 36 × 46 × 23 cm (14\" x 18\" x 9\"). The typefaces fit on a drum. A \"magic eye\" was mounted in the center of the keyboard which magnifies and allows the typist to review a selected character. Characters are selected by first pressing two keys to choose a desired character which is arranged according to a system Lin devised for his dictionary of the Chinese language. The selected Chinese character appeared in the magic eye for preview, the typist then pressed a \"master\" key, similar to today's computer function key. The typewriter could create 90,000 distinct characters using either one or two of six character-containing rollers, which in combination has 7000 full characters and 1,400 character radicals or partial characters.\n\nThe inspired aspect of the typewriter was the system Lin devised for a Chinese script. It had thirty geometric shapes or strokes (somewhat analogous to the elements of a glyph). These became \"letters\" by which to alphabetize Chinese characters. He broke tradition with the long-standing system of radicals and stroke order writing and categorizing of Chinese characters, inventing a new way of seeing and categorizing.\n\nThe typewriter was not produced commercially. According to Lin's daughter, Lin Tai-Yi, the day she was to demonstrate the machine to executives of the Remington Typewriter Company, they could not make it work. Although they did get the machine fixed for a press conference the next day, it was to no avail. Lin found himself deeply in debt. In 1947, Lin paid income taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service and went to work in Paris for UNESCO.\n\nBetween the 1930s and 1950s, Chinese typewriters had a political implication, as they were used in mass-production of leaflets and pamphlets. The typewriters also gained popular appeal and changed Chinese office work.\n\nAccording to Thomas Mullaney, it is possible that development of modern Chinese typewriters in the 1960s and 1970s influenced the development of modern computer word processors and even affected the development of computers themselves. Chinese typewriter engineers were trying to make the most common characters be accessible at the fastest speed possible by word prediction, a technique used today in Chinese input methods for computers, as well as in text messaging in many languages.\n\nChinese typewriter has become a metaphor for absurdity, complexity and backwardness in Western popular culture. One such example is MC Hammer's dance move named after the Chinese typewriter in the music video for \"U Can't Touch This\". The move, with its fast paced and large gestures, supposedly resembles a person working on a huge, complex typewriter.\n\nThe Chinese typewriter was ultimately eclipsed and made redundant with the introduction of computerised word processing, pioneered by engineer and dissident Wan Runnan and his partners when they formed Stone Emerging Industries Company () in 1984 in Zhongguancun, China's \"Silicon Valley\". Stone developed software to allow a Brother Industries dot matrix printer, distributed by Mitsui, to print Chinese characters and released the system as the MS-2400. \n\n\n"}

Its speakers traditionally were indigenous hunter-gatherers and reindeer-herders. Chukotko-Kamchatkan is endangered. \nThe Kamchatkan branch is moribund, represented only by Western Itelmen, with only 80 elderly speakers left (as of the 2010 Russian census). The Chukotkan branch had close to 7,000 speakers left (as of 2010, the majority being speakers of Chukchi), with a reported total ethnic population of 25,000.\n\nWhile the family is sometimes grouped typologically and geographically as Paleo-Siberian, no external genetic relationship has been widely accepted as proven. The most popular such proposals have been for links with Eskimo–Aleut, either alone or in the context of a wider grouping.\n\nLess commonly encountered names for the family are Chukchian, Chukotian, Chukotan, Kamchukchee and Kamchukotic. Of these, \"Chukchian\" and \"Chukotian\" are ambiguous, since both terms are sometimes used to refer specifically to the family's northern branch.\n\nIn addition, Luorawetlan (also spelled Luoravetlan) has been in wide use since 1775 as a name for the family, although it is properly the self-designation of one of its constituent languages, Chukchi. The derivative Luorawetlanic may be preferable as a name for the family.\n\nThe Chukotko-Kamchatkan family consists of two distantly related dialect clusters, Chukotkan and Kamchatkan. Chukotkan is considered anywhere from one to four languages, whereas there is only one surviving Kamchatkan language, Itelmen.\n\nThe relationship of the Chukotkan languages to Itelmen is distant, and has only been conclusively demonstrated recently.\n\nAll the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages are under pressure from Russian. Almost all speakers are bilingual in Russian, and most younger members of the ethnic groups associated with the languages speak Russian only.\n\nThe accepted classification is this:\n\n\nThe Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages have no generally accepted relation to any other language family. There are several theories about possible relationships to existing or hypothetical language families.\n\nThe Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages are sometimes classified among the Paleosiberian languages, a catch-all term for language groups with no identified relationship to one another that are believed to represent remnants of the language map of Siberia prior to the advances of Turkic and Tungusic.\n\nMichael Fortescue (2011) suggests that Chukokto-Kamchatkan and Nivkh (Gilyak) are related to each other on the basis of morphological, typological, and lexical evidence. Together, Chukokto-Kamchatkan and Nivkh (\"Amuric\") form a larger Chukokto-Kamchatkan-Amuric language family.\n\nJoseph Greenberg identifies Chukotko-Kamchatkan (which he names Chukotian) as a member of Eurasiatic, a proposed macrofamily that includes Indo-European, Altaic, and Eskimo–Aleut, among others. Greenberg also assigns Nivkh and Yukaghir, sometimes classed as \"Paleosiberian\" languages, to the Eurasiatic family.\n\nWhile the Eurasiatic hypothesis has been well received by Nostraticists and some Indo-Europeanists, it remains very controversial. Part of the reason for this is that the Eurasiatic hypothesis rests on mass comparison of lexemes, grammatical formatives, and vowel systems (see Greenberg 2000–2002) rather than on the prevailing view that regular sound correspondences, linked to a wide array of lexemes and grammatical formatives, are the only valid means to establish genetic relationship (see for instance Baldi 2002:2–19).\n\nMichael Fortescue, a specialist in Eskimo–Aleut as well as in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, argued for a link between Uralic, Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo–Aleut calling this proposed grouping Uralo-Siberian. Later, he has argued for Nivkh as the closest relative of Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and suggests interpreting the similarities to Uralo-Siberian through language contact.\n\nIn a 2015 paper, Gerhard Jäger of the University of Tübingen reported \"intriguing\" and \"controversial\" findings regarding Chukotko-Kamchatkan and Indo-European, amongst other language families. Using a variant of mass lexical comparison, augmented by computational linguistic techniques, such as large-scale statistical analysis, Jäger investigated \"deep genetic relations\" between many different language families. To increase the chances that genuine genetic relationships were detected, he eliminated from consideration \"rogue taxa\": languages and families that had ambiguous positions, due to random similarities or recent language contact. Jäger found evidence that Chukotko-Kamchatkan and the Indo-European languages had statistically-significant similarities with each other suggesting that they may have once formed part of a clade. On the whole, similarities between the two families were greater than either shared with any other language family. This was the case even when Jäger factored in similarities in phonology that were likely random coincidences (such as a \"surprisingly high number\" of resemblances in vocabulary between Chukotko-Kamchatkan and the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages). According to Jäger, when these \"rogue taxa\" were removed, the confidence value of a notional \"Indo-European/Chukotko-Kamchatkan clade\" fell only slightly, from 0.969 to a still statistically-significant 0.964.\n\n\n"}

The other condo units are typically retained or sold separately by the developer and may be retail space, office space or parking garage.\n\nCondops first came into use in the 1960s when the residential condominium was not yet popular in major cities, particularly in the United States in New York City, New York. This structure was used to separate the residential component from the commercial components of a building. Developers or co-op sponsors sought to retain ownership of the more lucrative non-residential spaces in a building, whilst also minimizing taxes on non-residential income. The condop is still a relatively rare item in the U.S. As of 2007, New York City had fewer than 300 condop buildings as compared to more than 6,700 cooperatives and 2,300 condominiums, representing just over three percent of residential buildings.\n\nThe condop is a type of condominium building, not a distinct legal construct. A condop, a contraction of the words condominium and cooperative (or \"co-op\"), is a co-op inside a condo.\n\nStepping back, condominium owners actually hold title to a piece of real estate. Co-op owners are actually shareholder-tenants with shares in and a long-term lease from the co-op corporation. In all co-ops, a corporation owns the building. Condops are a variation on that theme the distinction between the two concepts as the cooperative corporation does not own a whole building but just the residential condominium unit within it.\n\nSometimes the phrase condop is used to refer to the residential portion only of such a building (i.e. to distinguish it from the commercial unit(s)). However, this term is commonly misused to describe a cooperative corporation that behaves like a condominium.\n\nThe cooperative portion of the condop is effectively no different than any cooperative building that contains only residential units. However, in some real-estate circles, the term condop continues to be mis-used to refer to a cooperative that behaves like a condominium or a \"co-op with condo rules\". Typically condo will require a lower required down payment for prospective purchasers and do not include many of the restrictive measures that impact prospective purchasers of cooperative apartments. Further, the bylaws for a condo typically do not include the need for board approval to sell or sublet an apartment. Additionally, restrictions on alterations to the apartment are more consistent with cooperatives than condos.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "795012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=795012", "title": "Dog watch", "text": "Dog watch\n\nDog watch, in marine or naval terminology, is a watch, a period of work duty or a work shift, between 16:00 and 20:00 (4 pm and 8 pm). This period is split into two, with the 'first' dog watch from 16:00 to 18:00 (4 pm to 6 pm) and the 'last' dog watch from 18:00 to 20:00 (6 pm to 8 pm). Each of these watches is half the length of a standard watch.\n\nThe last dog watch is also referred to as the second dog watch in some sources. For instance Jack London in \"The Sea Wolf\", chapter 6: \"(rest) I can steal near the end of the second dog watch\". The Admiralty Manual of Seamanship from 1913 also refers to the first and second dog watches.\n\nThe reason behind this watch's existence is that, in order for the crew to rotate through all the watches, it was necessary to split one of the watches in half, to create an odd number of watches in a ship's day. This allowed the sailors to stand different watches instead of one team being forced to stand the mid-watch every night. The choice of time also allows both watches, if there are only two, to eat an evening meal at about the traditional time.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" states that the word 'dogwatch' is a direct translation from either German or Dutch of a similar term. It originally referred to the night-watch on ships — that is, the time when (on land) all but the dog were asleep. The name is also said to be derived from Sirius, the \"Dog Star\", on the claim that Sirius was the first star that can be seen at night. An alternative folk etymology is that the name arose because someone tasked with one of these 'half' watches was said to be 'dodging the watch', taking or standing the 'dodge watch'. This became shortened to 'dog watch'. Another variation is that those sleeping get only 'dog sleep' in this watch. Stephen Maturin of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series retells the 19th century humourist Theodore Hook's pun that the dog watch is so-named because it is \"cur-tailed\" (\"curtailed\", i.e. shortened). Dogging in seaman's terms means securing, such as dogging a hatch. It's called a dog watch because each watch is dogged , or secured prematurely to allow for meal times.\n\nIn the Chelsea Clock Company's (makers of Ship's Bell clocks) website explanation it says that ...\"the Evening Watch is periodically divided into two watches. These are called Dog Watches because they \"dog\" the watch schedule for all divisions ahead by one watch period\". It can be surmised that this may mean an action similar to the \"feed dogs\" on a sewing machine, although obviously the use of the term predates the use in the sewing machine. \n\n"}

{"id": "17344084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17344084", "title": "Durophagy", "text": "Durophagy\n\nDurophagy is the eating behavior of animals that consume hard-shelled or exoskeleton bearing organisms, such as corals, shelled mollusks, or crabs. It is mostly used to describe fish, but is also used when describing reptiles, including fossil turtles, placodonts and invertebrates, as well as \"bone-crushing\" mammalian carnivores such as hyenas. Durophagy requires special adaptions, such as blunt, strong teeth and a heavy jaw. Bite force is necessary to overcome the physical constraints of consuming more durable prey and gain a competitive advantage over other organisms by gaining access to more diverse or exclusive food resources earlier in life. Those with greater bite forces require less time to consume certain prey items as a greater bite force can increase the net rate of energy intake when foraging and enhance fitness in durophagous species. In the order Carnivora there are two dietary categories of durophagy; bonecrackers and bamboo eaters. Bonecrackers are exemplified by hyenas and saber-toothed cats, while bamboo eaters are primarily the giant panda and the red panda. Both have developed similar cranial morphology. However, the mandible morphology reveals more about their dietary resources. Both have a raised and dome-like anterior cranium, enlarged areas for the attachment of masticatory muscles, enlarged premolars, and reinforced tooth enamel. Bamboo eaters tend to have larger mandibles, while bonecrackers have more sophisticated premolars.\n\nMany fish exhibit durophagous behaviour including the Triggerfish, some Teleosts and some cichlids.\n\nTriggerfish have jaws that contain a row of four teeth on either side, the upper jaw containing an additional set of six plate-like pharyngeal teeth. Triggerfish do not have jaw protrusion and there are enlarged jaw adductor muscles for extra power to crush the protective shells and spines of their prey.\n\nThese fishes crush hard prey and do so with the use of their pharyngeal jaws, with the aid of their protrusible mouth for enabling the grabbing of prey to draw it into their mouth. The pharyngeal jaws found in more derived teleosts are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw and the pharyngeal branchial fusing to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle, the hypertrophied pharyngeal, to crush prey with help from the molariform pharyngeal teeth. This allows for the consumption of hard-shelled prey.\n\nMollusk shells can be crushed to expose soft parts of the prey to digestive juices or the soft parts can be removed from the shell. Species that crush shells are defined by their large and greatly thickened pharyngeal bones. These bones have flat-crowned teeth and along with their dorsal fellows drawn by powerful muscles, create a crushing mill. The jaws are less derived as they are for just for picking up relatively large objects.\n\nThe second method Cichlids use is to crush mollusk shells between powerful jaws armed with suitable teeth. Cichlids possess short, broad jaws armed with an outer row of relatively few, strong and conical teeth and several inner rows of finer, also conical teeth. Along with these features are the presence of foreshortening of the skull and development of particularly powerful mandibular adductor muscles. To feed with this type of structure the fish can protrude its mouth ventrally to permit muscles to be seized by the jaws and the mouth then is retracted rapidly so the hard-toothed jaws crush the mollusk shell with the resulting force. A series of biting movements completes the process and the shell fragments are spat out and the soft body is swallowed.\n\nWithin the \"Chondrichthyans,\" horn sharks (Heterodontidae), some rays (Myliobatidae) and chimeras (Holocephali) exhibit durophagous behaviour. They have adaptations to allow for this including stout flattened teeth, hypertrophied jaw adductor muscles and robust jaws to feed on hard prey such as crustaceans and molluscs. Sharks that crush prey have teeth with small, low rounded cusps that are numerous per row, or are molariform. The molariform teeth are smoothly rounded, lack cusps, and there are numerous teeth per row.\n\nHorn sharks have molariform teeth. The anterior teeth are pointed and are used for grasping while the posterior teeth are molariform and are used for crushing. Horn sharks feed primarily on limpets, bivalve molluscs and blue crabs.\n\nThe bonnethead shark \"Sphyrna tiburo\" uses ram feeding to capture crab, shrimp and fish which are placed between the molariform teeth where they are crushed. This species also uses suction to transport prey to the esophagus for swallowing. By combining durophagous characteristics with altered kinematic and motor patterns, bonnethead sharks can prey on hard shelled animals. This characteristic distinguishes prey crushing from simply biting, which is a behaviour exhibited by elasmobranchs. While bonnethead sharks feed almost exclusively on crabs, they have the same tooth structure as the Horn sharks (Heterodontiformes).\n\nChimeras (Holocephali) have pavement teeth that are flat, hexagonal in shape and interconnect to form an even dental plate. There is the presence of calcified strengthened cartilaginous jaws, calcified struts within the jaws and a lever ‘nutcracker’ system that amplifies the force of the jaw adductor muscles. The fusion of the palatoquadrate and mandibular symphysis, a restricted gape and asynchronous activation of the jaw adductors are key elements in the ‘nutcracker’ model of jaw-crushing ability. Chimeras use their pavement teeth for grinding molluscs, gastropods and crabs.\n\nMyliobatidae are free-swimming rays whose pectoral fins make up broad, powerful \"wings\" which include the eagle and cow-nose rays. They feed on molluscs and have dentitions adapted to crushing. Dentitions of durophagous myliobatids show several specializations in the jaws and teeth related to their diet. The cartilaginous jaws are strengthened by calcified struts (trabeculae), and the palatoquadrate and mandibular symphysis are fused. Strong ligaments connecting the upper and lower jaws restrict the jaw gape. The strong adductor muscles can be asynchronously activated.\n\nIn these groups, teeth are hexagonal and are arranged in anteroposterior files packed closely together in an alternating array to form an almost gap-free pavement, similar to the organization found in Chimeras. The teeth are covered with a layer of enameloid. The tooth pavement is stabilized by vertical surfaces that bear ridges and grooves which are interconnected with those on neighboring teeth. These rays also use their pavement teeth for grinding molluscs, gastropods and crabs. Cow nose rays are specialized suction feeders, which open and close their jaws to generate water movements that are used to excavate buried prey. Food capture is achieved by suction and the prey is then cleaned by actions similar to those used in excavation.\n\nAnteroposterior ridges of the basal plate extend from the posterior margin of the tooth and these interdigitate with those of the succeeding tooth and also form a shelf on which the body of the neighboring tooth rests. The dentition of the bat ray (\"Myliobatis californica\") is made up of a series of seven files of crushing teeth. The central hexagonal plate is very wide, taking up about half the width of the occlusal surface and it is flanked by three lateral files of smaller teeth on each side, the outermost being pentagonal. The crushing surface formed by the teeth of the upper jaw is more curved than that of the lower jaw.\n\nShorebirds commonly consume bivalves and snails which are low in chitin but the calcium carbonate shell makes up a large portion of their weight. Bivalves and snails are largely consumed whole by ducks and wading birds. The molluscivores that swallow snails or bivalves whole have large well-modularized gizzards for crushing the strong shells. The gizzard of red-necked stints and red knots is more than ten times larger than the proventriculus. The size of the gizzard is adaptable in these shore birds, becoming atrophied when soft food items like worms are consumed and increasing in size and muscularity following prolonged consumption of snails, cockles or mussels. The production of chitinase for the hydrolysis of chitin is important for birds that consume mollusks.\n\nSea otters preferentially forage on benthic invertebrates, particularly sea urchins, gastropod, bivalve mollusks, and crustaceans. Once prey is caught, the otters use their powerful jaws and sharp teeth to consume their meal quickly, even protective crustacean shells. They have canines that deliver a lethal bite, and molars that can crush bones and the shells of mollusks.\n\nSea otter molars are broad, flat, multi cuspid teeth and the carnassial are also modified for crushing. Both the temporalis and masseter muscles are well developed, creating a strong bite force. The teeth are extremely broad and carnassial are highly molarized. Captured prey is manipulated with the forepaws or is held temporarily in loose skin pouches in the armpits. For larger, heavier-shelled prey, otters will sometimes exhibit tool-use behavior, breaking open sea urchins and mussels with a false stone used as an anvil. Sea otters can also bite sea urchins and mussels open using their strong jaws and teeth. Adults can crush most of their food items but youngsters have not yet developed powerful enough jaws. Therefore, young otters require the assistance of a tool or stone. Tools may also be used when the molluscs are too large to be crushed in the jaws.\n\nAll mangabeys appear to be durophagous and possess relatively thick molar enamel and expanded premolars, dental adaptations for processing hard foods. Their diet consists of \"Sacoglottis gabonensis\" seeds. These seeds can remain on the ground for months without rotting. With hard-object feeding, Mangabeys needed selection to favour thick molar enamel and flattened molars for crushing seeds.\n\nThe Giant Panda is mainly a herbivore despite its short, relatively unspecialized digestive tract that is characteristic of carnivores. Giant Pandas lack microbial digestion in their rumen or caecum that is typical of most herbivores for breaking down cellulose and lignin in plant cell walls. Therefore, Giant Pandas need to get their nutrients from the cell contents and fraction of hemicellulose they can break down. The panda subsits mainly on bamboo and does so with modifications of their jaws. Pandas show elaboration of the crushing features of the dentition. The molars are broad, flat, multi cuspid teeth and are the main grinding surface. Jaw action is not a simple crushing one but rather a definite sideways grinding. Panda jaws have a large zygomatico-mandibularis muscle, which is responsible for the sideways movement of the jaw. The glenoid is very deep, preventing back and forth movement of the jaw.\n\nBamboo represents a predictable food source which is seasonally abundant. Pandas are able to subsist on it despite its low nutritive content. Pandas do this by moving large quantities through the digestive tract in a short period of time. They also reduce their energy expenditures by resting and only remaining active to feed, and they don't have a hibernation period, allowing them to have more foraging time. They chose security over uncertainty, indicated by their bamboo eating adaptations.\n\nBone-crushing eating habits appear to be associated with stronger teeth, as seen is in Hyaenids. This is because bone-crushing requires greater bite strength and increases the risk of canine breakage. In Hyaenids, The carnassial are slightly less specialized as cutting blades than those of the Felidae. The bone-crushing adaptations relate mainly to the premolars. The anterior and posterior cusps are reduced and the central cusp enlarged and widened, so that the tooth is converted from a blade-like structure to a heavy conical hammer. Strong muscles are also required for bone crushing, and the temporalis attachment on the skull is enlarged by a strong sagittal crest. Heavy, hammer-like teeth and extremely strong jaws and jaw muscles make it possible for hyaenas to crack larger bone than other carnivores are capable of, and their highly efficient cutting carnassials can deal with tough hides and tendons.\n\nThe wolverine has jaws and teeth that are extremely powerful and together with its scavenging habits, have earned the wolverine the name \"hyena of the north\". The wolverine is an effective scavenger, capable of cracking heavy bones and shows the same adaptations in the jaw as the hyenas do. The sagittal crest projects well above the area of attachment of the neck muscles, and in a large animal it extends back far behind the level of the condyles to provide attachments for the relatively enormous temporalis muscles, creating a powerful bite force.\n\n"}
{"id": "631821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=631821", "title": "Ecclesiastical Latin", "text": "Ecclesiastical Latin\n\nEcclesiastical Latin, also called Liturgical Latin or Church Latin, is a later form of Latin used to discuss Christian thought. It was created from the vulgar Latin of the third century. Ecclesiastical Latin includes words of Greek, Hebrew, and Classical Latin origin re-purposed with Christian meaning. It is less stylized and rigid in form than Classical Latin and commonly its pronunciation is based on Italian. \n\nEcclesiastical Latin was the language of liturgical rites in the Catholic Church, as well as the Anglican Church, Lutheran Church, Methodist Church, and in the Western Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Today, ecclesiastical Latin is primarily used in official documents of the Roman Catholic Church, but it is still learned by clergy today. \n\nThe Ecclesiastical Latin that is used in theological works, liturgical rites and dogmatic proclamations varies in style: syntactically simple in the Vulgate Bible, hieratic in the Roman Canon of the Mass, terse and technical in Aquinas' \"Summa Theologica\" and Ciceronian in Pope John Paul II's encyclical letter \"Fides et Ratio\".\n\nThe use of Latin in the Church started in the fourth century with the split of the Roman Empire after Emperor Theodosius in 395. Before this split, Greek was the primarily language of the Church as well as the language of the eastern half of the Roman Empire. Following the split, early theologians like Jerome translated Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin, the dominant language of the Western Roman Empire. The loss of Greek in the Western half of the Roman Empire, and the loss of Latin in the Eastern half of the Roman Empire were not immediate, but changed the culture of language as well as the development of the Church.\n\nThe use of Latin in the Western Church continued throughout the Middle Ages and into the time of the Reformation. One of Martin Luther's tenets of the Reformation was to have services and religious texts in the common tongue, rather than Latin, a language that at the time, only clergy understood. Protestants refrained from using Latin in services, however Protestant clergy had to learn and understand Latin as it was the language of higher learning and theological thought until the eighteenth century. \n\nEcclesiastical Latin continued to be the language of the Roman Catholic Church until the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) created by Pope John XXIII to discuss reforming liturgy. The Council decided to allow languages other than Latin to be used in Mass in order to relate the Church and its values to modern culture. However, the Church still produces its official liturgical texts in Latin, which provide a single clear point of reference for translations into all other languages. The same holds for the official texts of canon law and many other doctrinal and pastoral communications and directives of the Holy See, such as encyclical letters, \"motu proprios\", and declarations \"ex cathedra\".\n\nThe Holy See has for some centuries usually drafted documents in a modern language, but the authoritative text, published in the \"Acta Apostolicae Sedis\", is usually in Latin. Some texts may be published initially in a modern language and be later revised, according to a Latin version (or “editio typica”), after this Latin version is published. For example, the Catechism of the Catholic Church was drafted and published, in 1992, in French. The \"Latin\" text appeared only five years later, in 1997, and the French text was corrected to match the Latin version, which is regarded as the official text. The Latin-language department of the Vatican Secretariat of State (formerly the \"Secretaria brevium ad principes et epistolarum latinarum\") is charged with the preparation in Latin of papal and curial documents. Occasionally the official text is published in a modern language, e.g., the well-known edict \"Tra le sollecitudini\" (1903) by Pope Pius X (in Italian) and \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (1937) by Pope Pius XI (in German).\n\nThe rule now in force on the use of Latin in the Eucharistic liturgy of the Roman Rite states Mass is celebrated either in Latin or in another language, provided that the liturgical texts used have been approved according to the norm of law. Except for celebrations of the Mass that are scheduled by the ecclesiastical authorities to take place in the language of the people, priests are always and everywhere permitted to celebrate Mass in Latin.\n\nAfter the Reformation, in the Lutheran Churches, Latin was retained as the language of the Mass for weekdays, although for the Sunday Sabbath, the Deutsche Messe was to be said. In Geneva, among the Reformed Churches, \"persons called before the consistory to prove their faith answered by reciting the \"Paternoster\", the \"Ave Maria\", and the \"Credo\" in Latin.\" In the Anglican Church, the Book of Common Prayer was published in Latin, alongside English. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches, \"used Latin text in doctrinal writings\", as Martin Luther and John Calvin did in their era. In the training of Protestant clergy in Württemberg, as well as in the Rhineland, universities instructed divinity students in Latin and their examinations were conducted in this language. The University of Montauban under Reformed auspcices, required that seminarians complete two theses, with one being in Latin and as such, Reformed ministers were \"Latinist by training\", comparable to Roman Catholic seminarians.\n\nThere are not many differences between Classical Latin and Church Latin. One can understand Church Latin knowing the Latin of classical texts, as the main differences between the two are in pronunciation and spelling, as well as vocabulary.\n\nIn many countries, those who speak Latin for liturgical or other ecclesiastical purposes use the pronunciation that has become traditional in Rome by giving the letters the value they have in modern Italian but without distinguishing between open and close \"E\" and \"O\". \"AE\" and \"OE\" coalesce with \"E\"; before them and \"I\", \"C\" and \"G\" are pronounced (English \"CH\") and (English \"J\"), respectively. \"TI\" before a vowel is generally pronounced (unless preceded by \"S\", \"T\" or \"X\"). Such speakers pronounce consonantal \"V\" (not written as \"U\") as as in English, and double consonants are pronounced as such. The distinction in Classical Latin between long and short vowels is ignored, and instead of the 'macron', a horizontal line to mark the long vowel, an acute accent is used for stress. The first syllable of two-syllable words is stressed; in longer words, an acute accent is placed over the stressed vowel: adorémus 'let us adore'; Dómini 'of the Lord'.\n\nThe complete text of the Bible in Latin, the revised Vulgate, appears at Nova Vulgata - Bibliorum Sacrorum Editio. New Advent gives the entire Bible, in the Douay version, verse by verse, accompanied by the Vulgate Latin of each verse.\n\nIn 1976, the Latinitas Foundation (\"Opus Fundatum Latinitas\" in Latin) was established by Pope Paul VI to promote the study and use of Latin. Its headquarters are in Vatican City. The foundation publishes an eponymous quarterly in Latin. The foundation also published a 15,000-word Italian-Latin \"Lexicon Recentis Latinitatis\" (\"Dictionary of Recent Latin\"), which provides Latin coinages for modern concepts, such as a bicycle (\"birota\"), a cigarette (\"fistula nicotiana\"), a computer (\"instrumentum computatorium\"), a cowboy (\"armentarius\"), a motel (\"deversorium autocineticum\"), shampoo (\"capitilavium\"), a strike (\"operistitium\"), a terrorist (\"tromocrates\"), a trademark (\"ergasterii nota\"), an unemployed person (\"invite otiosus\"), a waltz (\"chorea Vindobonensis\"), and even a miniskirt (\"tunicula minima\") and hot pants (\"brevissimae bracae femineae\"). Some 600 such terms extracted from the book appear on a page of the Vatican website. The Latinitas Foundation was superseded by the Pontifical Academy for Latin () in 2012.\n\nLatin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Until the 1960s and still later in Roman colleges like the Gregorian, Roman Catholic priests studied theology using Latin textbooks and the language of instruction in many seminaries was also Latin, which was seen as the language of the Church Fathers. The use of Latin in pedagogy and in theological research, however, has since declined. Nevertheless, canon law requires for seminary formation to provide for a thorough training in Latin, though \"the use of Latin in seminaries and pontifical universities has now dwindled to the point of extinction.\" Latin was still spoken in recent international gatherings of Roman Catholic leaders, such as the Second Vatican Council, and it is still used at conclaves to elect a new Pope. The Tenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in 2004 was the most recent to have a Latin-language group for discussions.\n\nAlthough Latin is the traditional liturgical language of the Roman (Latin) Church, the liturgical use of the vernacular has predominated since the liturgical reforms that followed the Vatican II: liturgical law for the Latin Church states that Mass may be celebrated either in Latin or another language in which the liturgical texts, translated from Latin, have been legitimately approved. The permission granted for continued use of the Tridentine Mass in its 1962 form authorizes use of the vernacular language in proclaiming the Scripture readings after they are first read in Latin.\n\nIn historic Protestant Churches, such as the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Churches, Ecclesiastical Latin is often employed in sung celebrations of the Mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Writer Michael Horn describes it as moving \"beyond mass education to mass-customized education through blended learning,\" using the flexibility of technology to help students of varying backgrounds and skills. The term has been included in the term \"Entrepreneurship Education 3.0\" which denotes a broadening of entrepreneurship education with interdisciplinary appeal for non-business majors, according to a report in \"Technically Philly\" magazine.\n\nWith Education 3.0, classes move away from traditional lectures and instead focus on interactive learning, with question and answer sessions, reviews and quizzes, discussions, labs, and other project-based learning. It usually involves customization and personalization, such that educational content is tailored to meet the needs of specific students. It can mean reversing the traditional classroom learning, in which lectures happen in class and homework is done out of class, into flipped classrooms, such that new content is delivered online while students work on assignments together in class.\n\nThe term has been used by educational theorists in South Korea and in Latin America. According to a report in \"Forbes magazine\", schools such as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology or KAIST are actively exploring Education 3.0. In Latin America, \"Educación 3.0\" is being explored as a way to make education affordable to poor people throughout the region, and to help ameliorate poverty.\n\n\n"}

In monarchies, the monarch was often considered the \"father/mother of the nation\" or as a patriarch to guide his family. This concept is expressed in the Divine Right espoused in some monarchies, while in others it is codified into constitutional law as in Spain, where the monarch is considered the personification and embodiment, the symbol of the unity and permanence of the nation. In Thailand, the monarch is given the same recognition, and demonstrated loyalty is enforced with severe criminal statutes.\n\nMany dictators bestow titles upon themselves, which rarely survive the end of their regime. Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo's titles included \"father of the nation\", \"older brother\", and \"Guide of the People\". Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire's included \"Father of the nation\", \"the Guide\", \"the Messiah\", \"dajsh, \"the Leopard\", and \"the Sun-President\". \nIn postcolonial Africa, \"father of the nation\" was a title used by many leaders both to refer to their role in the independence movement as a source of legitimacy, and to use paternalist symbolism as a source of continued popularity. On Joseph Stalin's seventieth birthday in 1949, he was bestowed with the title \"Father of Nations\" for his establishment of \"people's democracies\" in countries occupied by the USSR after World War II.\n\nThe title \"Father of the Nation\" is sometimes politically contested. The 1972 Constitution of Bangladesh declared Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to be \"father of the nation\". The BNP government removed this in 2004, to the protests of the oppostition Awami League, led by Rahman's daughter Sheikh Hasina. A motion in the Parliament of Slovakia to proclaim controversial pre-war leader Andrej Hlinka \"father of the nation\" nearly passed in September 2007.\n\nThe following people are still often called the \"Father\" of their respective nations.

The subjects were made to view pornography; the device then measured the diameter of the pupils of the eyes (pupillary response test), perspiration, and pulse for a supposed erotic response.\n\nThe \"fruit machine\" was employed in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s during a campaign to eliminate all gay men from the civil service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the military. A substantial number of workers did lose their jobs. Although funding for the \"fruit machine\" project was cut off in the late 1960s, the investigations continued, and the RCMP collected files on over 9,000 \"suspected\" gay people.\n\nThe chair employed resembled that used by dentists. It had a pulley with a camera going towards the pupils, with a black box located in front of it that displayed pictures. The pictures ranged from the mundane to sexually explicit photos of men and women. It had previously been determined that the pupils would dilate in relation to the amount of interest in the picture per the technique termed 'the pupillary response test'.\n\nPeople were first led to believe that the machine's purpose was to rate stress. After knowledge of its real purpose became widespread, few people volunteered for it.\n\nThe accuracy and functional mechanism of the \"fruit machine\" was questionable. First, the pupillary response test was based on fatally flawed assumptions: that visual stimuli would give an involuntary reaction able to be measured scientifically; that homosexuals and heterosexuals would respond to these stimuli differently; and that there were only two types of sexuality. A physiological problem with the method was that the researchers failed to take into account the varying sizes of the pupils and the differing distances between the eyes. Other problems that existed were that the pictures of the subjects' eyes had to be taken from an angle, as the camera would have blocked the subjects' view of the photographs if it were placed directly in front. Also, the amount of light coming from the photographs changed with each slide, causing the subjects' pupils to dilate in a way that was unrelated to their interest in the picture. Finally, the dilation of the pupils was also exceedingly difficult to measure, as the change was often smaller than one millimeter.\n\nThe idea was based on a study done by an American university professor, which measured the sizes of the subjects' pupils as they walked through the aisles of grocery stores.\n\nBrian Drader's 1998 play \"The Fruit Machine\" juxtaposes the fruit machine project with a parallel storyline about contemporary homophobia.\n\nAlex Brett's novel \"Cold Dark Matter\" (2005) uses the project as a plot device.\n\n\n\n"}

Over time the feminine and masculine genders merged into a \"common gender\". A common gender is also partly used in some variants of Dutch, but in Dutch the merging is not complete, with some vestiges in pronouns. Swedish also has deviations from a complete common gender. Danish has no such vestiges, since unlike Dutch and German it does not use the same pronouns for objects and people, but like English it has \"natural gender\" personal pronouns for people, and separate \"grammatical gender\" pronouns for objects and animals.\n\nWhereas standard Danish and Swedish are very similar in regard to noun genders, many dialects of these languages have separate numbers of grammatical genders, from only one, and up to three. Norwegian while similar to these languages, uses three genders in its standard versions, but some dialects, like that of Bergen and the \"Riksmål\" dialect of \"Bokmål\" use two.\n\nAround 1300 Danish had three grammatical genders. Masculine nouns formed definite versions with \"-in\" (e.g.: \"dawin\" — the day, \"hæstin\" — the horse), feminine with \"-æn\" (\"kunæn\" - the woman, \"næsæn\" — the nose), and neuter with either \"-æt\" or \"-it\" (\"barnæt\" - the child, \"skipit\" - the ship). In some dialects, like East Jutlandic, Copenhagen and Stockholm, the \"-in\" and \"-æn\" suffixes merged to \"-en\" forms thereby losing the distinction between the two. Other dialects kept the distinction, like Insular Danish, where only the feminine suffix became \"-en\" while masculine form lost the \"n\" and became \"-i\" (\"dawi\" - the day, \"katti\" - the cat), or Norwegian and North Swedish where the masculine definite suffix became \"-en\", but feminine lost the \"n\" and became \"-a\" (\"mora/måma\" — the mother).\n\nLike in English, accusative and dative cases are merged to one objective case and is only marked on object pronouns.\nNorth Germanic languages use a definite suffix (or enclitic article) instead of a definite article, except when a preposition is attached to the noun, then a definite article is placed in front. Because these normally attach to common nouns and not proper nouns, they are usually not used for people. The only exceptions are as an epithet or a description, in which case the definite article for the common gender is used.\n\nDue to using natural genders for people, a problem arises when discussing a person of unknown or undefined gender. Traditionally the masculine pronouns have been used in that case, but that has caused some concern about cultural sexism. As a solution some feminists in Sweden have proposed to add a third class of gender-neutral pronouns for people. This is used in some places in Sweden. The Danish translation is added in parenthesis, but is not actually used, and lacks objective and possessive versions.

{"id": "37593992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37593992", "title": "Google Flu Trends", "text": "Google Flu Trends\n\nGoogle Flu Trends was a web service operated by Google. It provided estimates of influenza activity for more than 25 countries. By aggregating Google Search queries, it attempted to make accurate predictions about flu activity. This project was first launched in 2008 by Google.org to help predict outbreaks of flu. \n\nGoogle Flu Trends is now no longer publishing current estimates. Historical estimates are still available for download, and current data are offered for declared research purposes.\n\nThe idea behind Google Flu Trends (GFT) is that, by monitoring millions of users’ health tracking behaviors online, the large number of Google search queries gathered can be analyzed to reveal if there is the presence of flu-like illness in a population. Google Flu Trends compared these findings to a historic baseline level of influenza activity for its corresponding region and then reports the activity level as either minimal, low, moderate, high, or intense. These estimates have been generally consistent with conventional surveillance data collected by health agencies, both nationally and regionally.\n\nRoni Zeiger helped develop Google Flu Trends.\n\nGoogle Flu Trends was described as using the following method to gather information about flu trends.\n\nFirst, a time series is computed for about 50 million common queries entered weekly within the United States from 2003 to 2008. A query's time series is computed separately for each state and normalized into a fraction by dividing the number of each query by the number of all queries in that state. By identifying the IP address associated with each search, the state in which this query was entered can be determined.\n\nA linear model is used to compute the log-odds of Influenza-like illness (ILI) physician visit and the log-odds of ILI-related search query: \nP is the percentage of ILI physician visit and Q is the ILI-related query fraction computed in previous steps. β is the intercept and β is the coefficient, while ε is the error term.\n\nEach of the 50 million queries is tested as Q to see if the result computed from a single query could match the actual history ILI data obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This process produces a list of top queries which gives the most accurate predictions of CDC ILI data when using the linear model. Then the top 45 queries are chosen because, when aggregated together, these queries fit the history data the most accurately. Using the sum of top 45 ILI-related queries, the linear model is fitted to the weekly ILI data between 2003 and 2007 so that the coefficient can be gained. Finally, the trained model is used to predict flu outbreak across all regions in the United States.\n\nThis algorithm has been subsequently revised by Google, partially in response to concerns about accuracy, and attempts to replicate its results have suggested that the algorithm developers \"felt an unarticulated need to cloak the actual search terms identified\".\n\nGoogle Flu Trends tries to avoid privacy violations by only aggregating millions of anonymous search queries, without identifying individuals that performed the search. Their search log contains the IP address of the user, which could be used to trace back to the region where the search query is originally submitted. Google runs programs on computers to access and calculate the data, so no human is involved in the process. Google also implemented the policy to anonymize IP address in their search logs after 9 months.\n\nHowever, Google Flu Trends has raised privacy concerns among some privacy groups. Electronic Privacy Information Center and Patient Privacy Rights sent a letter to Eric Schmidt in 2008, then the CEO of Google. They conceded that the use of user-generated data could support public health effort in significant ways, but expressed their worries that \"user-specific investigations could be compelled, even over Google's objection, by court order or Presidential authority\".\n\nAn initial motivation for GFT was that being able to identify disease activity early and respond quickly could reduce the impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza. One report was that Google Flu Trends was able to predict regional outbreaks of flu up to 10 days before they were reported by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n\nIn the 2009 flu pandemic Google Flu Trends tracked information about flu in the United States. In February 2010, the CDC identified influenza cases spiking in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. However, Google’s data of search queries about flu symptoms was able to show that same spike two weeks prior to the CDC report being released.\n\n“The earlier the warning, the earlier prevention and control measures can be put in place, and this could prevent cases of influenza,” said Dr. Lyn Finelli, lead for surveillance at the influenza division of the CDC. “From 5 to 20 percent of the nation’s population contract the flu each year, leading to roughly 36,000 deaths on average.” \n\nGoogle Flu Trends is an example of collective intelligence that can be used to identify trends and calculate predictions. The data amassed by search engines is significantly insightful because the search queries represent people’s unfiltered wants and needs. “This seems like a really clever way of using data that is created unintentionally by the users of Google to see patterns in the world that would otherwise be invisible,” said Thomas W. Malone, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at MIT. “I think we are just scratching the surface of what’s possible with collective intelligence.” \n\nThe initial Google paper stated that the Google Flu Trends predictions were 97% accurate comparing with CDC data. However subsequent reports asserted that Google Flu Trends' predictions have sometimes been very inaccurate—especially over the interval 2011-2013, when it consistently overestimated flu prevalence, and over one interval in the 2012-2013 flu season predicted twice as many doctors' visits as the CDC recorded.\n\nOne source of problems is that people making flu-related Google searches may know very little about how to diagnose flu; searches for flu or flu symptoms may well be researching disease symptoms that are similar to flu, but are not actually flu. Furthermore, analysis of search terms reportedly tracked by Google, such as \"fever\" and \"cough\", as well as effects of changes in their search algorithm over time, have raised concerns about the meaning of its predictions. In fall 2013, Google began attempting to compensate for increases in searches due to prominence of flu in the news, which was found to have previously skewed results. However, one analysis concluded that \"by combining GFT and lagged CDC data, as well as dynamically recalibrating GFT, we can substantially improve on the performance of GFT or the CDC alone.\" A later study also demonstrates that Google search data can indeed be used to improve estimates, reducing the errors seen in a model using CDC data alone by up to 52.7 per cent.\n\nBy re-assessing the original GFT model, researchers uncovered that the model was aggregating queries about different health conditions, something that could lead to an over-prediction of ILI rates; in the same work, a series of more advanced linear and nonlinear better-performing approaches to ILI modelling have been proposed.\n\nSimilar projects such as the flu-prediction project by the institute of Cognitive Science Osnabrück carry the basic idea forward, by combining social media data e.g. Twitter with CDC data, and structural models that infer the spatial and temporal spreading of the disease.\n"}

The name \"Bus\" comes from its bus-like architecture.\n\nThe main goals of the IBus project include:\n\n\nThe draft \"Specification of IM engine Service Provider Interface\" document from the Northeast Asia OSS Forum Work Group 3 recommends bus-centric IM framework architectures with a bus implementation (similar to dbus). According to the specification, SCIM-1.4 is not considered suitable for further development as it is developed in C++, which usually causes ABI transition problems.\n\nSince then, succeeding projects like IM-BUS (led by James Su) and SCIM-2 (led by Zheng Hu) were started. However, both projects are suspended. Therefore, Huang Peng from Red Hat established the IBus project to prove the idea of IM-BUS by using Python, D-Bus and GLib rather than implementing the functions recommended by CJK OSS forum. In spite of that, IBus has already gained community acceptance, and FreeBSD and many Linux distribution such as Fedora and Ubuntu already have IBus in their package repositories. IBus became the new default input method framework in Fedora 11, and replaced SCIM in Ubuntu 9.10.\n\nIBus is developed in C and Python, thus avoiding the C++ ABI transition problem of SCIM <1.4.14.\n\nIBus provides most of its functionality through services. There are three kinds of services:\n\nIBus employs D-Bus to communicate among ibus-daemon, services, and IM clients such as terminal emulators, editors and web browsers. ibus-daemon manages all clients and services by receiving registrations from services, and sending D-Bus message to corresponding services and IM client.\n\nIt implements XIM protocol, and has GTK+ and Qt input method modules.\n\n\n\nibus-m17n is an IME that uses input methods and corresponding icons in the m17n database. Unlike ibus-table which supports plain tables, m17n input methods also support states, whose labels are displayed on the IBus panel (language bar). M17n input methods also support surrounding text, consequently, languages such as Thai and IMs such as plain Zhuyin that require this feature are supported through ibus-m17n.\n\nibus-table, developed by Yu Wei Yu, is an IME that loads tables of input methods which do not need complicated logic to select words.

He succeeded Erik Lindegren and, following his death, was succeeded by Horace Engdahl.\n\nAmongst other writings, Edfelt translated works by Nelly Sachs, Georg Trakl, Novalis, Andreas Gryphius, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.\n\nEdfelt was the son of lieutenant August Edfelt and Ellen Hellner. He grew up in Skara, where he studied Latin and Greek at the senior high school. In fall 1923, he studied Nordic Languages at Lund University. He also attended public lectures in Philosophy and History of Literature.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1930, with exception from his military service in 1925–26, Edfelt studied Nordic Languages, English, German, History of Literature and Pedagogics, including a course in History of Philosophy, at Uppsala university. During this period, he attended student circles that discussed Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung.\n\nAfter he had taken his master's degree in Uppsala in spring 1930, Edfelt moved to Stockholm. The financial crisis following the Wall Street crash of 1929 soon made its impact on the Swedish labor market, and in the beginning of the 30s Edfelt earned his living by writing literary reviews. In fall 1931, he was hired as a temporary-staff master at the municipal school in Storvik in Gästrikland.\n\nDuring winter 1930–31, Edfelt in Stockholm became acquainted with the female artist Hélène Apéria, to whom he later would dedicate his collection \"Aftonunderhållnng\" (Evening Entertainment). On March 2, 1932 the couple married at Nyloftet in Skansen in Stockholm.\n\nIn 1933, Edfelt temporary moved to the small town of Mariefred, where he completed his collection \"Högmässa\" (High Mass) under observation from the older poet Bertil Malmberg, who had settled down in the country idyll after his years in Munich.\n\nIn 1923, Edfelt made his debut with the poetry collection \"Gryningsröster\" (Dawn Voices) 1923, when he was only 19 years old. Then followed the collections \"Unga Dagar\" (Young Days) 1925 and \"Ansikten\" (Faces) 1929. Except the classics, he was influenced by Franz Werfel, Bertolt Brecht, Erich Kästner, Vilhelm Ekelund, Harriet Löwenhielm och Birger Sjöberg.\n\nEdfelt's mature poetry might be described as traditionalistic in form but modernistic in imagery. He got his major breakthrough in 1934 with \"Högmassa\" (High Mass), which was reviewed in many Swedish dailies. By that time, Edfelt was influenced by Swedish poets such as Bertil Malmberg, Birger Sjöberg, Bo Bergman and Erik Axel Karlfeldt but also by international celebrities such as Charles Baudelaire, Bert Brecht and T. S. Eliot.\n\nAnother characteristic trait for Edfelt's poetry from the 1930s are innumerous allusions to literature ranging from the Bible and ancient tragic playwrights to psychoanalysis and Modernism. Sometimes Edfelt even re-uses a part of the metric structure from older Swedish poets in order to create a certain mood.\n\n\"Aftonunderhållning\" (Evening Entertainment) 1932, \"I Denna Natt\" (This Very Night) 1936, \"Vintern Är Lång\" (The Winter Is Long) 1939 and \"Sång för Reskamrater\" (Song for Travelling Companions) 1941 all belong to the same creative period as \"Högmässa\". The contrast between dark human suffering and the redeeming flame of love distinguishes these books.\n\nIn the collections \"Elden och Klyftan\" (The Fire and the Cleft) 1943 and \"Bråddjupt Eko\" (Precipitous Echo) 1947, Edfelt's poetry becomes more introspective. From \"Hemliga slagfält\" (Secret Battlefields) 1952 onwards, there is an element of prose poetry in his collections.\n\n"}
{"id": "156996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156996", "title": "John Wilkins", "text": "John Wilkins\n\nJohn Wilkins, (16141672) was an Anglican clergyman, natural philosopher and author, and was one of the founders of the Royal Society. He was Bishop of Chester from 1668 until his death.\n\nWilkins is one of the few persons to have headed a college at both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. He was a polymath, although not one of the most important scientific innovators of the period. His personal qualities were brought out, and obvious to his contemporaries, in reducing political tension in Interregnum Oxford, in founding the Royal Society on non-partisan lines, and in efforts to reach out to religious nonconformists. He was one of the founders of the new natural theology compatible with the science of the time. He is particularly known for \"An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language\" (1668) in which, amongst other things, he proposed a universal language and an integrated system of measurement, similar to the metric system.\n\nWilkins lived in a period of great political and religious controversy, yet managed to remain on working terms with men of all political stripes; he was key in setting the Church of England on the path toward comprehension for as many sects as possible, \"and toleration for the rest.\"\nGilbert Burnet called him \"the wisest clergyman I ever knew. He was a lover of mankind, and had a delight in doing good.\"\n\nHis stepdaughter married John Tillotson, who became Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nHe was probably born at Canons Ashby, Northamptonshire, though some sources say Fawsley; his father Walter Wilkins (died 1625) was a goldsmith and his mother Jane Dod was daughter of John Dod, a well-known conforming Puritan. His mother then remarried, and Walter Pope was a half-brother.\n\nWilkins was educated at a school in Oxford run by Edward Sylvester, and matriculated at New Inn Hall. He then moved to Magdalen Hall, Oxford where his tutor was John Tombes, and graduated with a B.A. degree in 1631, an M.A. degree in 1634. He studied astronomy with John Bainbridge.\n\nWilkins went to Fawsley in 1637, a sheep-farming place with little population, dominated by the Knightley family, to whom he and then Dod may have ministered; Richard Knightley had been Dod's patron there. He was ordained a priest of the Church of England in Christ Church Cathedral in February 1638. He then became chaplain successively to Lord Saye and Sele, and by 1641 to Lord Berkeley. In 1644 he became chaplain to Prince Charles Louis, nephew of King Charles I, who was then in England.\n\nWilkins was one of the group of savants interested in experimental philosophy who gathered round Charles Scarburgh, the royalist physician who arrived in London in summer 1646 after the fall of Oxford to the parliamentarian forces. These included George Ent, Samuel Foster, Francis Glisson, Jonathan Goddard, Christopher Merrett, and John Wallis.\n\nOthers of Scarburgh's circle were William Harvey and Seth Ward. This London group, the Gresham College group of 1645, was described much later by Wallis, who mentions also Theodore Haak, anchoring it also to the Palatine exiles; there are clear connections to the Wilkins Oxford Philosophical Club, another and less remote precursor to the Royal Society.\n\nFrom 1648 Charles Louis was able to take up his position as Elector of the Palatinate on the Rhine, as a consequence of the Peace of Westphalia. Wilkins travelled to continental Europe, and according to Anthony Wood visited Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1648 Wilkins became Warden of Wadham College, in Oxford and under him the college prospered. He fostered political and religious tolerance and drew talented minds to the college, including Christopher Wren. Although he was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, Royalists placed their sons in his charge. From those interested in experimental science, he drew together a significant group known as the Oxford Philosophical Club, which by 1650 had been constituted with a set of rules. Besides some of the London group (Goddard, Wallis, Ward, Wren who was a young protégé of Scarburgh), it included (in the account of Thomas Sprat) Ralph Bathurst, Robert Boyle, William Petty, Lawrence Rooke, Thomas Willis, and Matthew Wren. Robert Hooke was gradually recruited into the Wilkins group: he arrived at Christ Church, Oxford in 1653, working his way to an education, became assistant to Willis, became known to Wilkins (possibly via Richard Busby) as a technician, and by 1658 was working with Boyle.\n\nIn 1656, Wilkins married Robina French née Cromwell, youngest sister of Oliver Cromwell, who had been widowed in 1655 when her husband Peter French, a canon of Christ Church, Oxford, had died. Wilkins thereby joined a high stratum of Parliamentary society, and the couple used rooms in Whitehall Palace. In 1659, shortly before his death, Oliver Cromwell arranged for Wilkins a new appointment as Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, an appointment that was confirmed by Richard Cromwell who succeeded his father as Lord Protector. Wilkins was there long enough to befriend and become a patron of Isaac Barrow.\n\nUpon the Restoration in 1660, the new authorities deprived Wilkins of the position given him by Cromwell; he gained appointment as prebendary of York and rector of Cranford, Middlesex. In 1661 he was reduced to preacher at Gray's Inn, lodging with his friend Seth Ward. In 1662 he became vicar of St Lawrence Jewry, London. He suffered in the Great Fire of London, losing his vicarage, library and scientific instruments.\n\nPossessing strong scientific tastes, Wilkins was a founding member of the Royal Society and was soon elected fellow and one of the Society's two secretaries: he shared the work with Henry Oldenburg, whom he had met in Oxford in 1656.\n\nWilkins became vicar of Polebrook, Northamptonshire, in 1666; prebendary of Exeter in 1667; and in the following year, prebendary of St Paul's and bishop of Chester. He owed his position as bishop to the influence of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Buckingham's approach to the religious problem of the day was comprehension, something less than religious tolerance but aimed at least at bringing in the Presbyterians among the nonconformists to the Church of England by some peaceful form of negotiation and arrangement. Wilkins too thought along these lines. He had been a sympathetic reader of John Humfrey's 1661 justification of his acceptance of re-ordination by William Piers, having already once been ordained in the Presbyterian style by a classis.\n\nAs Wilkins was ordained, he spoke out against the use of penal laws, and immediately tried to gather support from other moderate bishops to see what concessions to the nonconformists could be made.\n\nA serious effort was made in 1668 to secure a scheme of comprehension, with William Bates, Richard Baxter and Thomas Manton for the dissenters meeting Wilkins and Hezekiah Burton. Wilkins felt the Presbyterians could be brought within the Church of England, while the Independent separatists were left outside. It fell through by late summer, with Manton blaming John Owen for independent scheming for general toleration with Buckingham, and Baxter pointing the finger at the House of Lords.\n\nWilkins died in London, most likely from the medicines used to treat his kidney stones and stoppage of urine.\n\nHis numerous written works include:\n\nThe early scientific works were in a popular vein, and have links to the publications of Francis Godwin. \"The Discovery of a World in the Moone\" (1638) was followed up by \"A Discourse Concerning a New Planet\" (1640). The author highlights the similarities between the Earth and the Moon. Based on these similarities, he proposes the idea that the Moon would house living beings, the Selenites. Godwin's \"The Man in the Moone\" was also published in 1638. In 1641 Wilkins published an anonymous treatise entitled \"Mercury, or The Secret and Swift Messenger\". This was a small work on cryptography; it may well have been influenced by Godwin's \"Nuncius inanimatus\" (1629). His \"Mathematical Magic\" (1648) was divided into two sections, one on traditional mechanical devices such as the lever, and the other, more speculative, on machines. It drew on many authors, both classical writers and moderns such as Guidobaldo del Monte and Marin Mersenne. It alludes to Godwin's \"The Man in the Moone\", for bird-powered flight. These were light if learned works and admitted both blue-sky thinking, such as the possibility of the Moon being inhabitable, and references to figures on the \"occult\" side: Trithemius, John Dee, the Rosicrucians, Robert Fludd.\n\n\"Ecclesiastes\" (1646) is a plea for a plain style in preaching, avoiding rhetoric and scholasticism, for a more direct and emotional appeal. It analysed the whole field of available Biblical commentary, for the use of those preparing sermons, and was reprinted many times. It is noted as a transitional work, both in the move away from Ciceronian style in preaching, and in the changing meaning of elocution to the modern sense of vocal production.\n\n\"A Discourse Concerning the Beauty of Providence\" (1649) took an unfashionable line, namely that divine providence was more inscrutable than current interpreters were saying. It added to the reputation of Wilkins, when the Stuarts returned to the throne, to have warned that the short term reading of events as managed by God was risky.\n\nIn 1654, Wilkins joined with Seth Ward in writing \"Vindiciae academiarum\", a reply to John Webster's \"Academiarum Examen\", one of many attacks at the time on the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and their teaching methods. This attack had more clout than most: it was dedicated to John Lambert, a top military figure, and was launched during Barebone's Parliament, when radical change seemed on the cards. Wilkins (as NS) provided an open letter to Ward; and Ward (as HD, also taking the final letters of his name therefore) replied at greater length. Wilkins makes two main points: first, Webster is not addressing the actual state of the universities, which were not as wedded to old scholastic ways, Aristotle, and Galen, as he said; and secondly Webster's mixture of commended authors, without fuller understanding of the topics, really was foolish. In this approach Wilkins had to back away somewhat from his writings of the late 1630s and early 1640s. He made light of this in the way of pointing to Alexander Ross, a very conservative Aristotelian who had attacked his own astronomical works, as a more suitable target for Webster. This exchange was part of the process of the new experimental philosophers throwing off their associations with occultists and radicals.\n\nIn 1668 he published his \"Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language\". In it he attempted to create a universal language to replace Latin as a completely unambiguous tongue with which scholars and philosophers could communicate. One aspect of this work was the suggestion of an integrated system of measurement, similar to the metric system but which was never promoted.\n\nIn his lexicographical work he collaborated with William Lloyd. The \"\" (1663), a gently satirical ode to the Society, refers to this project:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19373", "title": "Maurice Merleau-Ponty", "text": "Maurice Merleau-Ponty\n\nMaurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty (; 14 March 1908 – 3 May 1961) was a French phenomenological philosopher, strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception, art, and politics. He was on the editorial board of \"Les Temps modernes\", the leftist magazine established by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.\n\nAt the core of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the world. Like the other major phenomenologists, Merleau-Ponty expressed his philosophical insights in writings on art, literature, linguistics, and politics. He was the only major phenomenologist of the first half of the twentieth century to engage extensively with the sciences and especially with descriptive psychology. It is through this engagement that his writings became influential in the project of naturalizing phenomenology, in which phenomenologists use the results of psychology and cognitive science.\n\nMerleau-Ponty emphasized the body as the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of knowledge, and maintained that the body and that which it perceived could not be disentangled from each other. The articulation of the primacy of embodiment led him away from phenomenology towards what he was to call “indirect ontology” or the ontology of “the flesh of the world” (\"la chair du monde\"), seen in his final and incomplete work, \"The Visible and Invisible\", and his last published essay, “Eye and Mind”.\n\nMerleau-Ponty supported Soviet communism and his endorsement of the Soviet show trials and prison camps was published as \"Humanism and Terror\" in 1947.\n\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty was born in 1908 in Rochefort-sur-Mer, Charente-Maritime, France. His father died in 1913 when Merleau-Ponty was five years old. After secondary schooling at the lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, Merleau-Ponty became a student at the École Normale Supérieure, where he studied alongside Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Simone Weil, and Jean Hyppolite. He attended Edmund Husserl's \"Paris Lectures\" in February 1929. In 1929, Merleau-Ponty received his DES degree (\"\", roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) from the University of Paris, on the basis of the (now-lost) thesis \"La Notion de multiple intelligible chez Plotin\" (\"Plotinus's Notion of the Intelligible Many\"), directed by Émile Bréhier. He passed the agrégation in philosophy in 1930.\n\nAn article published in French newspaper \"Le Monde\" in October 2014 makes the case of recent discoveries about Merleau-Ponty's likely authorship of the novel \"Nord. Récit de l'arctique\" (Grasset, 1928). Convergent sources from close friends (Beauvoir, Elisabeth \"Zaza\" Lacoin) seem to leave little doubt that Jacques Heller was a pseudonym of the 20-year-old Merleau-Ponty.\n\nMerleau-Ponty taught first at the Lycée de Beauvais (1931–33) and then got a fellowship to do research from the . From 1934–1935 he taught at the Lycée de Chartres. He then in 1935 became a tutor at the École Normale Supérieure, where he was awarded his doctorate on the basis of two important books: \"La structure du comportement\" (1942) and \"Phénoménologie de la Perception\" (1945).\n\nAfter teaching at the University of Lyon from 1945 to 1948, Merleau-Ponty lectured on child psychology and education at the Sorbonne from 1949 to 1952. \nHe was awarded the Chair of Philosophy at the Collège de France from 1952 until his death in 1961, making him the youngest person to have been elected to a Chair.\n\nBesides his teaching, Merleau-Ponty was also political editor for the leftist \"Les Temps modernes\" from the founding of the journal in October 1945 until December 1952. In his youth he had read Karl Marx's writings and Sartre even claimed that Merleau-Ponty converted him to Marxism. While he was not a member of the French Communist Party and did not identify as a Communist, he laid out an argument justifying the Soviet show trials and violence for progressive ends in general in the work \"Humanism and Terror\" in 1947. However, about three years later, he renounced his earlier support for political violence, and he rejected Marxism and advocated a liberal left position in \"Adventures of the Dialectic\" (1955). His friendship with Sartre and work with \"Les Temps modernes\" ended because of that, since Sartre still had a more favourable attitude towards Soviet communism. Merleau-Ponty was subsequently active in the French non-communist left and in particular in the Union of the Democratic Forces.\n\nMerleau-Ponty died suddenly of a stroke in 1961 at age 53, apparently while preparing for a class on René Descartes. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\n\nIn his \"Phenomenology of Perception\" (first published in French in 1945), Merleau-Ponty developed the concept of the body-subject (\"le corps propre\") as an alternative to the Cartesian \"ego cogito.\" This distinction is especially important in that Merleau-Ponty perceives the essences of the world existentially. Consciousness, the world, and the human body as a perceiving thing are intricately intertwined and mutually \"engaged.\" The phenomenal thing is not the unchanging object of the natural sciences, but a correlate of our body and its sensory-motor functions. Taking up and \"communing with\" (Merleau-Ponty's phrase) the sensible qualities it encounters, the body as incarnated subjectivity intentionally elaborates things within an ever-present world frame, through use of its pre-conscious, pre-predicative understanding of the world's makeup. The elaboration, however, is \"inexhaustible\" (the hallmark of any perception according to Merleau-Ponty). Things are that upon which our body has a \"grip\" (\"prise\"), while the grip itself is a function of our connaturality with the world's things. The world and the sense of self are emergent phenomena in an ongoing \"becoming.\"\n\nThe essential partiality of our view of things, their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, as there is no other way for things to be copresent with us and with other things than through such \"Abschattungen\" (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations). The thing transcends our view, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself to a range of possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its background—to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz's monads). Through involvement in the world – being-in-the-world – the perceiver tacitly experiences all the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment, as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.\n\nEach object is a \"mirror of all others.\" Our perception of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional, or clearly delineated, perception; rather, it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the body's primordial involvement and understanding of the world and of the meanings that constitute the landscape's perceptual gestalt. Only after we have been integrated within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can we turn our attention toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly. This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new \"Gestalt\" oriented toward a particular object. Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, we encounter meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world.\n\nFrom the time of writing \"Structure of Behavior\" and \"Phenomenology of Perception\", Merleau-Ponty wanted to show, in opposition to the idea that drove the tradition beginning with John Locke, that perception was not the causal product of atomic sensations. This atomist-causal conception was being perpetuated in certain psychological currents of the time, particularly in behaviourism. According to Merleau-Ponty, perception has an active dimension, in that it is a primordial openness to the lifeworld (the \"Lebenswelt\").\n\nThis primordial openness is at the heart of his thesis of the primacy of perception. The slogan of Husserl's phenomenology is \"all consciousness is consciousness of something\", which implies a distinction between \"acts of thought\" (the noesis) and \"intentional objects of thought\" (the noema). Thus, the correlation between noesis and noema becomes the first step in the constitution of analyses of consciousness. However, in studying the posthumous manuscripts of Husserl, who remained one of his major influences, Merleau-Ponty remarked that, in their evolution, Husserl's work brings to light phenomena which are not assimilable to noesis–noema correlation. This is particularly the case when one attends to the phenomena of the body (which is at once body-subject and body-object), subjective time (the consciousness of time is neither an act of consciousness nor an object of thought) and the other (the first considerations of the other in Husserl led to solipsism).\n\nThe distinction between \"acts of thought\" (noesis) and \"intentional objects of thought\" (noema) does not seem, therefore, to constitute an irreducible ground. It appears rather at a higher level of analysis. Thus, Merleau-Ponty does not postulate that \"all consciousness is consciousness of something\", which supposes at the outset a noetic-noematic ground. Instead, he develops the thesis according to which \"all consciousness is perceptual consciousness\". In doing so, he establishes a significant turn in the development of phenomenology, indicating that its conceptualisations should be re-examined in the light of the primacy of perception, in weighing up the philosophical consequences of this thesis.\n\nTaking the study of perception as his point of departure, Merleau-Ponty was led to recognize that one's own body (\"le corps propre\") is not only a thing, a potential object of study for science, but is also a permanent condition of experience, a constituent of the perceptual openness to the world. He therefore underlines the fact that there is an inherence of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account. The primacy of perception signifies a primacy of experience, so to speak, insofar as perception becomes an active and constitutive dimension.\n\nMerleau-Ponty demonstrates a corporeity of consciousness as much as an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them. In the \"Phenomenology of Perception\" Merleau-Ponty wrote: “Insofar as I have hands, feet, a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a way that I do not choose” (1962, p. 440).\n\nThe question concerning corporeity connects also with Merleau-Ponty's reflections on space (\"l'espace\") and the primacy of the dimension of depth (\"la profondeur\") as implied in the notion of \"being in the world\" (\"être au monde\"; to echo Heidegger's \"In-der-Welt-sein\") and of one's own body (\"le corps propre\").\n\nThe highlighting of the fact that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the ego is one of the conclusions of \"The Structure of Behavior\" that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty's later works. Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject is in a position to undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.\nHe carefully considers language, then, as the core of culture, by examining in particular the connections between the unfolding of thought and sense—enriching his perspective not only by an analysis of the acquisition of language and the expressivity of the body, but also by taking into account pathologies of language, painting, cinema, literature, poetry and song.\n\nThis work deals mainly with language, beginning with the reflection on artistic expression in \"The Structure of Behavior\"—which contains a passage on El Greco (p. 203ff) that prefigures the remarks that he develops in \"Cézanne's Doubt\" (1945) and follows the discussion in \"Phenomenology of Perception\". The work, undertaken while serving as the Chair of Child Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of the Sorbonne, is not a departure from his philosophical and phenomenological works, but rather an important continuation in the development of his thought.\n\nAs the course outlines of his Sorbonne lectures indicate, during this period he continues a dialogue between phenomenology and the diverse work carried out in psychology, all in order to return to the study of the acquisition of language in children, as well as to broadly take advantage of the contribution of Ferdinand de Saussure to linguistics, and to work on the notion of structure through a discussion of work in psychology, linguistics and social anthropology.\n\nMerleau-Ponty distinguishes between primary and secondary modes of expression. This distinction appears in \"Phenomenology of Perception\" (p. 207, 2nd note [Fr. ed.]) and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language () (\"The Prose of the World\", p. 10). Spoken language (), or secondary expression, returns to our linguistic baggage, to the cultural heritage that we have acquired, as well as the brute mass of relationships between signs and significations. Speaking language (), or primary expression, such as it is, is language in the production of a sense, language at the advent of a thought, at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense.\n\nIt is speaking language, that is to say, primary expression, that interests Merleau-Ponty and which keeps his attention through his treatment of the nature of production and the reception of expressions, a subject which also overlaps with an analysis of action, of intentionality, of perception, as well as the links between freedom and external conditions.\n\nThe notion of style occupies an important place in \"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence\". In spite of certain similarities with André Malraux, Merleau-Ponty distinguishes himself from Malraux in respect to three conceptions of style, the last of which is employed in Malraux's \"The Voices of Silence\". Merleau-Ponty remarks that in this work \"style\" is sometimes used by Malraux in a highly subjective sense, understood as a projection of the artist's individuality. Sometimes it is used, on the contrary, in a very metaphysical sense (in Merleau-Ponty's opinion, a mystical sense), in which style is connected with a conception of an \"über-artist\" expressing \"the Spirit of Painting\". Finally, it sometimes is reduced to simply designating a categorization of an artistic school or movement. (However, this account of Malraux's notion of style—a key element in his thinking—is open to serious question.)\n\nFor Merleau-Ponty, it is these uses of the notion of style that lead Malraux to postulate a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty, it is important to consider the heart of this problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. (However, Merleau-Ponty's reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux's theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux.) For Merleau-Ponty, style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature.\n\nIn his essay \"Cézanne's Doubt\", in which he identifies Paul Cézanne's impressionistic theory of painting as analogous to his own concept of radical reflection, the attempt to return to, and reflect on, prereflective consciousness, Merleau-Ponty identifies science as the opposite of art. In Merleau-Ponty's account, whereas art is an attempt to capture an individual's perception, science is anti-individualistic. In the preface to his \"Phenomenology of Perception\", Merleau-Ponty presents a phenomenological objection to positivism: that it can tell us nothing about human subjectivity. All that a scientific text can explain is the particular individual experience of that scientist, which cannot be transcended. For Merleau-Ponty, science neglects the depth and profundity of the phenomena that it endeavors to explain.\n\nMerleau-Ponty understood science to be an \"ex post facto\" abstraction. Causal and physiological accounts of perception, for example, explain perception in terms that are only arrived at after abstracting from the phenomenon itself. Merleau-Ponty chastised science for taking itself to be the area in which a complete account of nature may be given. The subjective depth of phenomena cannot be given in science as it is. This characterizes Merleau-Ponty's attempt to ground science in phenomenological objectivity and, in essence, institute a \"return to the phenomena.\"\n\nMerleau-Ponty's critical position with respect to science was stated in his Preface to the \"Phenomenology\"— he described scientific points of view as \"always both naive and at the same time dishonest\". Despite, or perhaps because of, this view, his work influenced and anticipated the strands of modern psychology known as post-cognitivism. Hubert Dreyfus has been instrumental in emphasising the relevance of Merleau-Ponty's work to current post-cognitive research, and its criticism of the traditional view of cognitive science.\n\nDreyfus's seminal critique of cognitivism (or the computational account of the mind), \"What Computers Can't Do\", consciously replays Merleau-Ponty's critique of intellectualist psychology to argue for the irreducibility of corporeal know-how to discrete, syntactic processes. Through the influence of Dreyfus's critique and neurophysiological alternative, Merleau-Ponty became associated with neurophysiological, connectionist accounts of cognition.\n\nWith the publication in 1991 of \"The Embodied Mind\" by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch, this association was extended, if only partially, to another strand of \"anti-cognitivist\" or post-representationalist cognitive science: embodied or enactive cognitive science, and later in the decade, to neurophenomenology. In addition, Merleau-Ponty's work has also influenced researchers trying to integrate neuroscience with the principles of chaos theory.\n\nIt was through this relationship with Merleau-Ponty's work that cognitive science's affair with phenomenology was born, which is represented by a growing number of works, including\n\nMerleau-Ponty has also been picked up by Australian and Nordic philosophers inspired by the French feminist tradition, including Rosalyn Diprose and .\n\nDiprose's recent work takes advantage of Merleau-Ponty's conception of an intercorporeity, or indistinction of perspectives, to critique individualistic identity politics from a feminist perspective and to ground the irreducibility of generosity as a virtue, where generosity has a dual sense of giving and being given.\n\nHeinämaa has argued for a rereading of Merleau-Ponty's influence on Simone de Beauvoir. (She has also challenged Dreyfus's reading of Merleau-Ponty as behaviorist, and as neglecting the importance of the phenomenological reduction to Merleau-Ponty's thought.)\n\nMerleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the body has also been taken up by Iris Young in her essay \",\" and its follow-up, \"'Throwing Like a Girl': Twenty Years Later.\" Young analyzes the particular modalities of feminine bodily comportment as they differ from that of men. Young observes that while a man who throws a ball puts his whole body into the motion, a woman throwing a ball generally restricts her own movements as she makes them, and that, generally, in sports, women move in a more tentative, reactive way. Merleau-Ponty argues that we experience the world in terms of the \"I can\" – that is, oriented towards certain projects based on our capacity and habituality. Young's thesis is that in women, this intentionality is inhibited and ambivalent, rather than confident, experienced as an \"I cannot.\"\n\n\"Ecophenomenology\" can be described as the pursuit of the relationalities of worldly engagement, both human and those of other creatures (Brown & Toadvine 2003).\n\nThis engagement is situated in a kind of middle ground of relationality, a space that is neither purely objective, because it is reciprocally constituted by a diversity of lived experiences motivating the movements of countless organisms, nor purely subjective, because it is nonetheless a field of material relationships between bodies. It is governed exclusively neither by causality, nor by intentionality. In this space of in-betweenness phenomenology can overcome its inaugural opposition to naturalism.\n\nDavid Abram explains Merleau-Ponty's concept of \"flesh\" (\"chair\") as \"the mysterious tissue or matrix that underlies and gives rise to both the perceiver and the perceived as interdependent aspects of its spontaneous activity,\" and he identifies this elemental matrix with the interdependent web of earthly life. This concept unites subject and object dialectically as determinations within a more primordial reality, which Merleau-Ponty calls \"the flesh,\" and which Abram refers to variously as \"the animate earth,\" \"the breathing biosphere,\" or \"the more-than-human natural world.\" Yet this is not nature or the biosphere conceived as a complex set of objects and objective processes, but rather \"the biosphere as it is experienced and \"lived from within\" by the intelligent body — by the attentive human animal who is entirely a part of the world that he, or she, experiences. Merleau-Ponty's ecophenemonology with its emphasis on holistic dialog within the larger-than-human world also has implications for the ontogenesis and phylogenesis of language, indeed he states that \"language is the very voice of the trees, the waves and the forest.\" \n\nMerleau-Ponty himself refers to \"that primordial being which is not yet the subject-being nor the object-being and which in every respect baffles reflection. From this primordial being to us, there is no derivation, nor any break...\" Among the many working notes found on his desk at the time of his death, and published with the half-complete manuscript of \"The Visible and the Invisible\", several make evident that Merleau-Ponty himself recognized a deep affinity between his notion of a primordial \"flesh\" and a radically transformed understanding of \"nature.\" Hence in November 1960 he writes: \"Do a psychoanalysis of Nature: it is the flesh, the mother.\" And in the last published working note, written in March 1961, he writes: \"Nature as the other side of humanity (as flesh, nowise as 'matter').\"\n\nThe following table gives a selection of Merleau-Ponty's works in French and English translation.\n\n\n"}

One of Turay's Quranic students was a young man named Kisimi Kamara. Kamara was the grandson of Turay's sister. Kamara also married Turay's daughter, Mariama. Turay devised a form of writing called 'Mende Abajada' (meaning 'Mende alphabet'), which was inspired in part by the Arabic abjad and in part by the Vai syllabary. Some scholars have also suggested that some of the characters were inspired by certain indigenous Mende pictograms and cryptographic characters that are widely known to the Mende people.\n\nTuray's \"Mende Abajada\" was adjusted a bit (order of characters) by Kamara and probably corresponds to the first 42 characters of the script, which is an abugida. Kamara developed the script further with help from his brothers, adding more than 150 other syllabic characters. Kamara then popularized the script and gained quite a following as result—which he used to help establish himself as one of the most important chiefs in southern Sierra Leone during his time (he was not a 'simple village tailor' as suggested by some contemporary writers).\n\nKikakui is still used today, but perhaps by less than 500 people. There is also an associated number writing system, which is entirely original (and, like the characters of the script, written from right to left).\n\nThere were an original 42 syllabic characters that were ordered according to sound and shape, while 150 more characters were later added without the same consistency to the character set. Some of the initial 42 characters resemble an abugida, given the standard ability for a reader to discern the vowels from seeing the character, as indicated by dots in consistent locations, but such uniformity vanishes in the remaining 150 characters. Glyphic variants have been found for certain characters.\n\nAdditionally, digits are encoded by indicating the place value on each digit for a number, with the units digit alone having no special indication. Beyond the 10s digit, the further digits are written on top of the base place value indicator, which increases in vertical lines from 2 at the 100s place (indicating 2*10 + the digit above) to the millionths digit that is encoded (which has 6). All of the different possible digits are encoded separately.\n\nMende Kikakui script was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Mende Kikakui is U+1E800–U+1E8DF:\n\nKonrad Tuchscherer, African Script and Scripture: The History of the Kikakui (Mende) Writing System for Bible Translations,\" African Languages and Cultures, 8, 2 (1995), pp. 169–188. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1771691>\n\n"}

The above L-function is called Ramanujan's L-function.\n\nRamanujan conjectured the following:\n\nRamanujan observed that the quadratic equation of in the denominator of RHS of ,\n\nwould have always imaginary roots from many examples. The relationship between roots and coefficients of quadratic equations leads the third relation, called Ramanujan's conjecture. Moreover, for the Ramanujan tau function, let the roots of the above quadratic equation be and , then\n\nwhich looks like the Riemann Hypothesis. It implies an estimate that is only slightly weaker for all the , namely for any :\n\nIn 1917 L. Mordell proved the first two relations using techniques from complex analysis, specifically what are now known as Hecke operators. The third statement followed from the proof of the Weil conjectures by . The formulations required to show that it was a consequence were delicate, and not at all obvious. It was the work of Michio Kuga with contributions also by Mikio Sato, Goro Shimura, and Yasutaka Ihara, followed by . The existence of the connection inspired some of the deep work in the late 1960s when the consequences of the étale cohomology theory were being worked out.\n\nIn 1937, Erich Hecke used Hecke operators to generalize the method of Mordell's first two proofs of the Ramanujan conjectures to the automorphic L-function of the discrete subgroups of .

This conjecture was named after him. Under the Petersson metric it is shown that we can define the orthogonality on the space of modular forms as the space of cusp forms and its orthogonal space and they have finite dimensions. Furthermore, we can concretely calculate the dimension of the space of holomorphic modular forms, using the Riemann-Roch theorem (see the dimensions of modular forms).\n\nThe Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture for Maass forms is still open (as of 2016) because Deligne's method, which works well in the holomorphic case, does not work in the real analytic case.\n\n reformulated the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture in terms of automorphic representations for as saying that the local components of automorphic representations lie in the principal series, and suggested this condition as a generalization of the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture to automorphic forms on other groups. Another way of saying this is that the local components of cusp forms should be tempered. However, several authors found counter-examples for anisotropic groups where the component at infinity was not tempered. and showed that the conjecture was also false even for some quasi-split and split groups, by constructing automorphic forms for the unitary group and the symplectic group that are non-tempered almost everywhere, related to the representation .\n\nAfter the counterexamples were found, suggested that a reformulation of the conjecture should still hold. The current formulation of the generalized Ramanujan conjecture is for a globally generic cuspidal automorphic representation of a connected reductive group, where the generic assumption means that the representation admits a Whittaker model. It states that each local component of such a representation should be tempered. It is an observation due to Langlands that establishing functoriality of symmetric powers of automorphic representations of will give a proof of the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture.\n\nObtaining the best possible bounds towards the generalized Ramanujan conjecture in the case of number fields has caught the attention of many mathematicians. Each improvement is considered a milestone in the world of modern Number Theory. In order to understand the Ramanujan bounds for , consider a unitary cuspidal automorphic representation:\n\nThe Bernstein–Zelevinsky classification tells us that each p-adic can be obtained via unitary parabolic induction from a representation\n\nHere each formula_14 is a representation of , over the place , of the form\n\nwith formula_16 tempered. Given , a Ramanujan bound is a number such that\n\nLanglands classification can be used for the archimedean places. The generalized Ramanujan conjecture is equivalent to the bound .\n\nFor reductive groups other than , the generalized Ramanujan conjecture would follow from principle of Langlands functoriality. An important example are the classical groups, where the best possible bounds were obtained by as a consequence of their Langlands functorial lift.\n\nDrinfeld's proof of the global Langlands correspondence for over a global function field leads towards a proof of the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture. Lafforgue (2002) successfully extended Drinfeld's shtuka technique to the case of in positive characteristic. Via a different technique that extends the Langlands-Shahidi method to include global function fields, proves the Ramanujan conjecture for the classical groups.\n\nAn application of the Ramanujan conjecture is the explicit construction of Ramanujan graphs by Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak. Indeed, the name \"Ramanujan graph\" was derived from this connection. Another application is that the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture for the general linear group implies Selberg's conjecture about eigenvalues of the Laplacian for some discrete groups.\n\n"}

It was first brought to public attention by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their non-fiction book \"All the President's Men\" (1974).\n\nWoodward and Bernstein's exposé \"All the President's Men\" reports that many staffers who had attended the University of Southern California (\"USC\") - such as Donald Segretti, Tim Elbourne, Ronald Louis Ziegler, H. R. Haldeman, and Dwight Chapin - had participated in the highly competitive student elections there. UPI reporter Karlyn Barker sent Woodward and Bernstein a memo, \"Notes On the USC Crowd\", that outlined the connection. Fraternities, sororities, and underground fraternal coordinating organizations - such as Theta Nu Epsilon and their splintered rival \"Trojans for Representative Government\" - engaged in creative tricks and underhanded tactics to win student elections. Officially, control over minor funding and decision-making on campus life was at stake, but the positions also gave bragging rights and prestige. The tactics were either promoted by or garnered the interest of major political figures on the USC board of trustees, such as Dean Rusk and John A. McCone. It was here that the term \"ratfucking\" had its origin.\n\nThe term received media attention in Australia after it was reported that the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd used the term in a tirade about China at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, candidate Ted Cruz said \"Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him\", a euphemised reference to the term.\n\nThe term \"ratfucking\" (\"rat\" in this case is shorthand for \"ration\") is an unofficial slang term used by soldiers in the U.S. Army to mean the targeted pillaging of MREs (Meals Ready-To-Eat), which the U.S. military calls \"field stripping\". It refers to the process of opening a case of MREs, which are packed 12 in a box, opening up individual MRE packages, removing the desired items (generally M&M's and other sweets), and leaving the unenticing remainder.\n\nIn August of 2017, journalist Marcy Wheeler garnered the disapprobation of the Federal Communications Commission when she used the term in a radio broadcast. Wheeler maintained that the word has become a term of art in political science and is thus not an obscenity. The FCC disagreed.\n\nAn early use of the term (as \"rat-fuck\") appears in Edmund Wilson's \"The Twenties\", in an entry dated February, 1922.\n\nA more benign use of the term \"ratfucking\" was commonplace in Southern California (and possibly other) college slang from the late 1950s to at least the early 1960s, meaning a prank. Around that time, Tony Auth was the cartoonist for the \"UCLA Daily Bruin\". One of his cartoons showed a large, inebriated rat suggesting to another rat, \"Let's go PF-ing tonight!\", a play on ratfucking or \"RF-ing\". The lead story in the January 6, 1961, \"California Tech\", Caltech's student newspaper, was headlined, \"Tech Scores First Televised RF\". The article chronicled the Great Rose Bowl Hoax, which had just taken place. A political context was irrelevant to such usage. At the end of the article, an Editor's Note both explained and bowdlerized: \"RF (for Royal Flush) is a contemporary college colloquialism for a clever prank.\"\n\nThe term was used by the character Jimmy McGill in season 2, episode 10, of the television show \"Better Call Saul\", after he pulled a dirty trick on his brother Chuck.\n"}
{"id": "147613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147613", "title": "Samadhi", "text": "Samadhi\n\nSamādhi (Sanskrit: , ), also called \"samāpatti\", in Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and yogic schools refers to a state of meditative consciousness. In the Yogic traditions, and the Buddhist commentarial tradition on which the Burmese Vipassana movement and the Thai Forest traditon rely, it is a meditative absorption or trance, attained by the practice of \"dhyāna\". In the oldest Buddhist suttas, on which several contemporary western Theravada teachers rely, it refers to the development of a luminous mind which is equanimous and mindfull.\n\nIn Buddhism, it is the last of the eight elements of the Noble Eightfold Path. In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, it is the eighth and final limb identified in the \"Yoga Sutras\" of Patanjali.\n\n\nVarious interpretations for the term's etymology are possible:\n\nCommon Chinese terms for samādhi include the transliterations \"sanmei\" (三昧) and \"sanmodi\" (三摩地 or 三摩提), as well as the translation of the term literally as \"ding\" (定 \"fixity\"). Kumarajiva's translations typically use \"sanmei\" (三昧), while the translations of Xuanzang tend to use \"ding\" (定 \"fixity\"). The Chinese Buddhist canon includes these as well as other translations and transliterations of the term.\n\nAccording to Rhys Davids the first attested usage of the term \"samadhi\" in Sanskrit literature was in the \"Maitri Upanishad.\"\n\nThe origins of the practice of \"dhyana\", which culminates into \"samadhi\", are a matter of dispute. According to Bronkhorst, \"dhyana\" was a Buddhist invention, whereas Alexander Wynne argues that dhyana was incorporated from Brahmanical practices, in the Nikayas ascribed to Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. These practices were paired to mindfulness and insight, and given a new interpretation. Kalupahana also argues that the Buddha \"reverted to the meditational practices\" he had learned from Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta.\n\nThe term 'Samadhi' derives from the root sam-a-dha, which means 'to collect' or 'bring together', and thus it is often translated as 'concentration' or 'unification of mind'. In the early Buddhist texts, samadhi is also associated with the term samatha (calm abiding). In the commentarial tradition, samadhi is defined as \"ekaggata\", one-pointedness of mind (\"Cittass'ekaggatā\").\n\nBuddhagosa defines samadhi as \"the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object [...] the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and unscattered.\" According to Buddhaghosa, the Theravada Pali texts mention four kinds of samadhi: \n\n\"Samadhi\" is the last of the eight elements of the Noble Eightfold Path. It is often interpreted as referring to \"dhyana\", but in the suttas \"samadhi\" and \"dhyana\" are not the same. While \"samadhi\" is one-pointed concentration, in \"dhyana\" this \"samadhi\" is used in the initial stages, to give way to a state of equanimity and mindfulness. The practice of \"dhyana\" makes it possible to keep access to the senses in a mindful way, avoiding primary responses to the sense-impressions. \n\nThe Suttapitaka and the Agamas describe four stages of \"rupa jhāna\". \"Rupa\" refers to the material realm, in a neutral stance, as different form the \"kama\" realm (lust, desire) and the \"arupa\"-realm (non-material realm). Each jhāna is characterised by a set of qualities which are present in that jhana.\n\n\nAccording to Richard Gombrich, the sequence of the four \"rupa-jhanas\" describes two different cognitive states:\nAlexander Wynne further explains that the \"dhyana\"-scheme is poorly understood. According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as \"sati\", \"sampajāno\", and \"upekkhā\", are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states, whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects:\nThe Noble Eightfold Path is a condensation of more elaborate descriptions of this path, which starts with a householder who hears the dhamma and leaves home (either literally or figuratively), and after preparatory practices starts with the practice of \"dhyana\". The Pāli canon describes eight progressive states of \"jhāna\": four meditations of form (\"rūpa jhāna\"), and four formless meditations (\"arūpajhānas\"), though the early texts do not use the term dhyana for the four formless meditations, calling them instead \"āyatana\" (dimension, sphere, base). A ninth form is \"Nirodha-Samāpatti\".\n\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the four \"rūpa jhāna\" may be an original contribution of the Buddha to the religious landscape of India. They formed an alternative to the painful ascetic practices of the Jains. The \"arūpa jhāna\" were incorporated from non-Buddhist ascetic traditions. According to Crangle, the development of meditative practices in ancient India was a complex interplay between Vedic and non-Vedic traditions.\n\nA core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between \"dhyana\" and insight. The Buddhist tradition has incorporated two traditions regarding the use of jhana. There is a tradition that stresses attaining insight (bodhi, prajna, kensho) as the means to awakening and liberation. But it has also incorporated the yogic tradition, as reflected in the use of jhana, which is rejected in other sutras as not resulting in the final result of liberation. The problem was famously voiced in 1936 by Louis de La Vallee Poussin, in his text \"Musila et Narada: Le Chemin de Nirvana\".\n\nSchmithausen discerns three possible roads to liberation as described in the suttas, to which Vetter adds the sole practice of \"dhyana\" itself, which he sees as the original \"liberating practice\":\n\nThis problem has been elaborated by several well-known scholars, including Tilman Vetter, Johannes Bronkhorst, and Richard Gombrich. Schmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \"liberating insight\", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36. Both Schmithausen and Bronkhorst note that the attainment of insight, which is a cognitive activity, cannot be possible in state wherein all cognitive activity has ceased. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, \"dhyana\" itself constituted the original \"liberating practice\". According to Alexander Wynne, the ultimate aim of \"dhyana\" was the attainment of insight, and the application of the meditative state to the practice of mindfulness. According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects. According to Frauwallner, this may have been the Buddha's original idea. According to Wynne, this stress on mindfulness may have led to the intellectualism which favoured insight over the practice of \"dhyana\".\n\nGrouped into the \"jhana\"-scheme are four meditative states, referred to in the early texts as \"aruppas\". These are also referred to in commentarial literature as immaterial/formless \"jhānas\" (\"arūpajhānas\"), also translated as The Formless Dimensions, in distinction from the first four \"jhānas\" (\"rūpa jhānas\"). In the Buddhist canonical texts, the word \"jhāna\" is never explicitly used to denote them, they are instead referred to as \"āyatana\". However, they are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four \"jhānas\" (other texts. e.g. MN 121 treat them as a distinct set of attainments) and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jhānas. The immaterial are related to, or derived from, yogic meditation, and aim more specific at concentration, while the \"jhanas\" proper are related to the cultivation of the mind. The state of complete dwelling in emptiness is reached when the eighth \"jhāna\" is transcended.\n\nThe four \"arupas\" are:\n\nAlthough the \"Dimension of Nothingness\" and the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the Noble Eightfold Path. Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\nAccording to Buddhaghosa, in his influential standard-work Visuddhimagga, \"samadhi\" is the \"proximate cause\" to the obtainment of wisdom. The Visuddhimagga describes 40 different objects for meditation, which are mentioned throughout the Pali canon, but explicitly enumerated in the Visuddhimagga, such as mindfulness of breathing (\"anapanasati\") and loving kindness (\"metta\").\n\nSeveral western teachers (Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Leigh Brazington, Richard Shankman) make a distinction between 'sutta-oriented' \"jhana' and \"'Visuddhimagga\"-oriented' \"jhana. Thanissaro Bhikkhu has repeatedly argued that the Pali Canon and the \"Visuddhimagga\" give different descriptions of the jhanas, regarding the \"Visuddhimagga\"-description to be incorrect. Keren Arbel has conducted extensive research on the \"jhanas\" and the contemporary criticisms of the commentarial interpretation. Based on this research, and her own experience as a senior meditation-teacher, she gives a reconstructed account of the original meaning of the \"dhyanas\". She argues that \"jhana\" is an integrated practice, describing the fourth \"jhana\" as \"lucid awareness,\" not as a state of deep concentration.\n\nThe earliest extant Indian Mahayana texts emphasize ascetic practices and forest dwelling, and absorption in states of meditative oneness. These practices seem to have occupied a central place in early Mahayana, also because they \"may have given access to fresh revelations and inspiration.\"\n\nIn the Indian Mahayana traditions the term is also to refer to forms of \"samadhi\" other than \"dhyana\". Section 21 of the \"Mahavyutpatti\" records even 118 samadhi. The Samadhiraja Sutra for example has as its main theme a samādhi called 'the samadhi that is manifested as the sameness of the essential nature of all dharmas' (\"sarva-dharma-svabhavā-samatā-vipañcita-samādhi\").\n\nIndian \"dhyana\" was translated as \"chán\" in Chinese, and \"zen\" in Japanese. Ideologically the Zen-tradition emphasizes prajna and sudden insight, but in the actual practice prajna and samādhi, or sudden insight and gradual cultivation, are paired to each other. Especially some lineages in the Rinzai school of Zen stress sudden insight, while the Sōtō school of Zen lays more emphasis on shikantaza, training awareness of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference.\n\n\"Samadhi\" is the main subject of the eighth limb of the Yoga Sutras called \"Samadhi-pada\". They resemble the Buddhist \"jhanas\". According to David Gordon White, the language of the \"Yoga Sutras\" is often closer to \"Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, the Sanskrit of the early Mahayana Buddhist scriptures, than to the classical Sanskrit of other Hindu scriptures.\" According to Karel Werner,\nRobert Thurman writes that Patañjali was influenced by the success of the Buddhist monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox. However, it is also to be noted that the Yoga Sutra, especially the fourth segment of Kaivalya Pada, contains several polemical verses critical of Buddhism, particularly the Vijñānavāda school of Vasubandhu.\n\nSamadhi is oneness with the object of meditation. There is no distinction between act of meditation and the object of meditation. Samadhi is of two kinds, with and without support of an object of meditation:\n\nAccording to Ian Whicher, the status of \"sananda\" and \"sasmita\" in Patanjali's system is a matter of dispute. According to Maehle, the first two constituents, deliberation and reflection, form the basis of the various types of \"samapatti\". According to Feuerstein, \nIan Whicher disagrees with Feuerstein, seeing \"ananda\" and \"asmita\" as later stages of \"nirvicara-samapatti\". Whicher refers to Vācaspati Miśra (900-980 CE), the founder of the Bhāmatī Advaita Vedanta who proposes eight types of \"samapatti\":\n\nVijnana Bikshu (ca. 1550-1600) proposes a six-stage model, explicitly rejecting Vacaspati Misra's model. Vijnana Bikshu regards joy (\"ananda\") as a state that arises when the mind passes beyond the \"vicara\" stage. Whicher agrees that \"ananda\" is not a separate stage of \"samadhi\". According to Whicher, Patanjali's own view seems to be that \"nirvicara-samadhi\" is the highest form of cognitive ecstasy.\n\nAccording to Taimni, dharana, dhyana and samadhi form a graded series:\n\nRamana Maharshi distinguished between \"kevala nirvikalpa samadhi\" and \"sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi\":\n\"Kevala nirvikalpa samadhi\" is temporary, whereas \"sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi\" is a continuous state throughout daily activity. This state seems inherently more complex than \"sāmadhi\", since it involves several aspects of life, namely external activity, internal quietude, and the relation between them. It also seems to be a more advanced state, since it comes after the mastering of \"samadhi\".\n\n\"Sahaja\" is one of the four keywords of the Nath sampradaya along with Svecchachara, Sama, and Samarasa. \"Sahaja\" meditation and worship was prevalent in Tantric traditions common to Hinduism and Buddhism in Bengal as early as the 8th–9th centuries.\n\nIn Sikhism the word is used to refer to an action that one uses to remember and fix one's mind and soul on Waheguru. The Sri Guru Granth Sahib informs:\n\nThe term \"Samadhi\" refers to a state of mind rather than a physical position of the body. The Scriptures explain: \n\nThe Sikh Gurus inform their followers: \n\nGeneral\nHinduism\nBuddhism\nIslam\nWestern traditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is one of the four martyrs of the Nepalese revolution that toppled the Rana regime. The other three are Dashrath Chand, Dharma Bhakta Mathema and Ganga Lal Shrestha.\n\nShastri was also a social reformer and author who wrote a number of books in Nepali and Nepal Bhasa.\n\nShastri was born in Varanasi, India where his father Madhav Raj and mother Ratna Maya Joshi were living in forced exile due to political reasons. Madhav Raj was a leader of the Arya Samaj in Nepal. The Joshis were originally from Lalitpur.\n\nShukra Raj was schooled in India, and he acquired the title Shastri after earning a Shastri degree from Dehradun. He became better known by this name than his actual surname Joshi.\n\nReturning to Nepal, Shastri joined the democracy struggle. During a demonstration organized at Indra Chok, Kathmandu by the Citizens' Rights Committee, he spoke out strongly against the Rana regime and demanded the people's rights. For this act, he was arrested and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He was subsequently sentenced to death, and on 24 January 1941, he was hanged from a tree on the side of the road at Pachali, Teku, Kathmandu.\n\nThe Ranas were eventually overthrown in February 1951, and democracy was established in Nepal. The Rana oligarchy ruled Nepal from 1846 until 1951. During this time, the Shah king was reduced to a figurehead and the prime minister and other government positions were hereditary. Jang Bahadur Rana established the Rana dynasty in 1846 by masterminding the Kot massacre in which about 40 members of the nobility including the prime minister and a relative of the king were murdered. Tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution characterized Rana rule. This 104-years of Rana regime has been called as one of the darkest periods of Nepalese history.\n\nShastri was one of the leaders of the Nepal Bhasa renaissance. He wrote a grammar of the language entitled \"Nepal Bhasa Vyakaran\" which was published from Kolkata in 1928. He was the first to produce children's literature. His other works include \"Nepal Bhasa Reader\", Books 1 and 2 (1933) and \"Nepali Varnamala\" (1933).\n\nIt is believed that Shastri was executed more for his work in social reform and efforts to develop his mother tongue Nepal Bhasa than his involvement in politics. Shastri did not belong to any political party unlike the other three martyrs who were members of Nepal Praja Parishad.\n\nShastri and the other martyrs are honored on Martyrs Day which is observed annually on Magh 16 (30 January in 2012) across the country. Shukra Path, a street in downtown Kathmandu, is named after him. Shastri's statues have been erected at a number of places, and the Postal Service Department has issued commemorative postage stamps depicting his image. A monument known as Shahid Gate containing the busts of the four martyrs and King Tribhuvan was built in central Kathmandu in 1961.\n\n"}

About 14% of the Romanian language is of Slavic origin.\n\nThe intercultural process also enriched the Slavic languages, which borrowed Vulgar Latin words and terms from Romanian, as, for example, mezin<medzin (from Latin medianus), \"the younger child, second-born, in the middle\", which became 'mĕzinu' in some Slavic languages.\n\nRomanian is a Romance language, belonging to the Eastern Romance group. It descends from Danubian Latin, a vernacular that emerged from the Romanization of Dacia and the Balkan peninsula and formed in the period of the 6th or 7th to 8th centuries. The substratum is Dacian (or \"Thraco-Dacian\"), the superstratum is Slavic. Old Slavic influence began either in the 6th–7th or 8th–9th centuries according to scholars, ending in the 11th–12th centuries. Romanian has borrowed a significant amount of Slavic words into its vocabulary that for a while scholars viewed it as being a Slavic language. An analysis in the mid-20th century indicated 11.5% Slavic borrowings.\n\nThe introduction of Slavic in post-Roman Dacia was similar to the appearance of Germanic dialects in the Western Roman Empire, where Gallic Latin, Iberian Latin, and Italian dialects became somewhat Germanized. However, due to a systematically decimated Latin-speaking population during the medieval migrations, Slavic remained spoken for much longer, even after the assimilation of Slavs into the Romanian people. This partly explains why spoken Romanian is somewhat less intelligible to speakers of Western Romance languages, which was influenced by Germanic tribes who were almost Romanized.\n\nWhile Dacia was part of the Roman Empire for less than two centuries, various Slavic tribes crossed, ruled and settled the former Roman province from the 6th to the 12th centuries. Their presence was stronger in Moldova and Bessarabia, where in the 16th century Rusyn-speaking Slavs made up about a third of the population. The Moldavian principality was called by the Russian sources as \"Russo-Vlahia\" (Русовлахия). Although the Slavs migrated from the north, they were smoothly assimilated north of the lower Danube to the Latin-speaking population. Meanwhile, the Slavs assimilated large parts of the Romanized population (the Vlachs) south of the Danube, in the Balkans (South Slavs); thus the presence of Slavs was also stronger in the southern areas of the Danube.\n\nUnlike their counterparts in the west, the Dacian Romance-speaking population became rural and did not preserve written Latin for a long time under the new rulers, like the Vulgar Latin in the west, as Vulgar Latin as usually unwritten. Therefore, the written Old Church Slavonic, especially its Bulgarian redaction originating in the capital of Preslav, spread as the literary language of Wallachia and Moldavia. Modern Romania (\"Wallachia\") continues to be surrounded by Slavic speakers (with the exception of Hungarian after the 10th-11th century), and have influenced Romanian through centuries of interaction. Early Slavic features in Romanian have a primarily South Slavic (mainly Bulgarian and somewhat less, but also present Serbian) character (Bulgarian loanwords were brought by Bulgarian settlers from First and Second Bulgarian Empires), while later borrowings (especially in the modern Republic of Moldova, where the majority of the population continues to be bilingual or multilingual) have East Slavic (mostly Russian, due to the Soviet Union, and less frequently Rusyn or Ukrainian) origin; the latter is caused by the Romanianization policies of the territories of Bukovina (today split between Romania and Ukraine) and Bessarabia (today by 2/3 in the Republic of Moldova and 1/3 in Ukraine), historically populated by the Romanians and Ukrainians for hundreds of years, that brought the closure of the Ukrainian public schools (all such schools were closed until 1928) and the suppression of most of the Ukrainian (Ruthenian) cultural institutions. The very term \"Ukrainians\" was prohibited from the official usage and some populations of disputable Ukrainian ethnicity were rather called the \"citizens of Romania who forgot their native language\" and were forced to change their last names to Romanian-sounding ones (among those who were Romanianized were descendants of Romanians who were assimilated to Ukrainian society in the past). Nevertheless, Romanian retained loanwords of Ukrainian origin; because Ukraine and Moldova were part of Soviet Union (Moldova was formed by Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina), and Wallachia and Bessarabia were under Russian rule (and Russian was the official language of Soviet Union, thus spoken by Ukrainians and Moldovans as second language (many speak it as their first language), and is the main language of Ukraine in pop culture and informal and business communications and the language of interethnic communication of Moldovans), Romanian added loanwords of Russian origin. Same situation happens in the partially recognised state of Transnistria. In parts of Ukraine where Romanians constitute a significant share of the local population (districts in Chernivtsi, Odessa and Zakarpattia oblasts), Romanian is taught in schools as a primary language, and Romanian in Ukraine borrows words of Ukrainian and Russian origin. Because USSR occupied Bessarabia and northern Bukovina in 1940, wherein Bessarabia becomes Moldova and Ukraine and northern Bukovina becomes part of Ukraine, it is ironic that Ukraine has populations of Romanians who were may be descendants of Ukrainians and Russians who underwent Romanianization policies. Borrowings in Romanian in Vojvodina and Timočka Krajina, Serbia (called Vlach) have Serbian origin. Romanian also obtained loanwords of West Slavic (mostly Polish) origin, after Polish settlers lived in Bukovina in 18th century and in Bessarabia in 14th-16th centuries. As Romania (\"Wallachia\") continues to be surrounded by Slavic speakers, Romanian continued to be influenced by Slavic languages and various other Slavs settled Romania, Romanian borrowed words of other West Slavic and South Slavic origin; West Slavic loanwords include Czech and Slovak origins, while other South Slavic loanwords include Croatian and Macedonian origin.\n\nOf great importance was the fact that Old Church Slavonic was the liturgical language of the Romanian Orthodox Church from the Middle Ages to the 18th century; same situation with Western Romance languages that borrowed words from Classical Latin, the liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church. However, Latin did hold an important position in Transylvania after the 12th century (when it was part of the Westernized, feudal Kingdom of Hungary), and like Western Romance languages, Romanian borrowed words from Classical Latin (the standard dialect of Latin). Liturgical Romanian was first officially used there after the union of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Transylvania with Rome, giving birth to the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church in 1698 (the most widespread denomination in Transylvania until World War II). This caused Romanian to easier lose some of its Slavic borrowings; the first standardisation (among others, the switch to the Latin alphabet) was done by the Transylvanian School (). However, the capital of independent Romania (Bucharest) was located in the eastern part of the country (where Hungarian, German and Latin influences were minimal).\n\nIn other Eastern Romance languages with Slavic loanwords, Aromanian have mostly Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Serbian words (although the slavic loans in Aromanian number is tiny), Megleno-Romanian has Bulgarian and Macedonian terms, and Istro-Romanian has Croatian and, more significantly, Slovene terms.\n\nTwo types of Slavic borrowings can be distinguished in Romanian. First came everyday words describing animals and emotional states, as well as grammatical features appearing in spoken and written Romanian. These Slavic features were incorporated into Balkan Latin through the contact of Romanian speakers with early Slav settlers, these Slavic words became Latinized. With the spread of Orthodox Christianity and Cyrillic script, literary words from Church Slavonic (old Bulgarian) were introduced to supplement Romanian with terms for abstract concepts not present in the local Latin dialect. Writing in the old Romanian language first appeared in the Cyrillic alphabet (the alphabet of the First Bulgarian Empire, created in Preslav) in the 16th century, existing in Romania until the 1860s. In Bessarabia (under Russian suzerainty) the alphabet was Cyrillic until 31 August 1989 (except for the interwar period, when it was part of the Kingdom of Romania with autonomy from Moscow). However, the predominantly Russian republic of Transnistria has kept Cyrillic as its alphabet.\n\nSome words describing family relations are Slavic, or show heavy Slavic influence: \"nevastă\" (\"wife\", from \"nevesta\"), \"rudă\" (\"relatives\", from \"roda\"), \"plod\" (\"baby\", from \"plod\", \"fruit\"), the suffix -că added to the Latin root \"fi-\" in \"fiică\" \"daughter\" (cf. Bulgarian \"shterka\" and Serbo-Croatian \"kćerka\"), \"bunică\" (\"granny\") or \"maică\" (\"mother\"). The degree to which Slavic and Romance populations interacted is also underscored by many words describing affection which are borrowed from Slavic.\n\nRoughly a fifth of spoken Romanian colloquial vocabulary is based on common Slavic roots such as: \"a iubi\" \"to love\", \"a citi\" \"to read\", \"nevoie\" \"need\", \"cinstit\" \"honest\",\"prieten\" \"friend\", \"trebuie\" \"necessary\", \"ceașcă\" \"cup\". This situation is akin to the number and usage of French borrowings in English. Slavic borrowings are especially frequent when strong emotional terms or feelings are involved: \"silă\" \"compulsion\", \"vină\" \"guilt\", \"jale\" \"sorrow\", \"milă\" \"compassion\", \"boală\" \"illness, disease\", \"iubire\" \"love\", \"dragoste\" \"love\", \"slavă\" \"glory\", \"nădejde\" \"hope\", etc. Slavic-derived adjectives and participles seem to have been borrowed in droves and form a whole lexical layer: \"slab\", \"drag\", \"bolnav\", \"bogat\", \"prost\", \"drăguț\", \"cinstit\", \"iscusit\", \"iubit\", \"jalnic\", \"zadarnic\", \"vrednic\", \"obraznic\", \"voinic\", \"groaznic\", \"harnic\", \"strașnic\", \"darnic\", \"milostiv\", \"mucenic\".\n\nRomanian uses numerous Slavic verbs to describe actions and changes of state: \"a lovi\" \"to hit\", \"a goni\" \"to chase\", \"a topi\" \"to melt\", \"a găsi\" \"to find\", \"a trezi\" \"to wake up\", \"a pomeni\" \"to mention\", etc. Many others borrowings exist in different spheres of life: \"silă\" \"force\", \"război\" \"war\", \"noroi\" \"dirt\", \"bogăție\" \"richness\", \"trup\" \"body\", \"plod\" \"fetus\", \"oglindă\" \"mirror\", \"copită\" \"hoof\", \"zori\" \"dawn\", \"zăpadă\" \"snow\", \"ceas\" \"time\", \"nisip\" \"sand\", \"vreme\" \"weather\", etc. Compare less-numerous Germanic borrowings in Western Romance languages, such as in Spanish: \"guerra\" \"war\" (Slavic \"război\" in Romanian), \"rico\" \"rich\" (Slavic \"bogat\"), \"ganso\" \"goose\" (Slavic \"gâscă\"), \"buscar\" \"to search\" (Slavic \"a găsi\"—\"to find\" in Romanian).\n\nAt the arrival of the Slavs, the Romance-speaking Vlachs were rural cattle breeders, sometimes in a season transhumant way ; most Romanian vocabulary related to cattle and cattle-breeding is of Latin origin. In contrast, most tools and utensils related to agronomy (as well as urban life) were replaced with Slavic names: \"lopată\" \"spade\" (Proto-Slavic *lopata), \"daltă\" \"chisel\" (*delto), \"topor\" \"axe\" (*toporъ), \"sită\" \"sieve\" (*sito), \"nicovală\" \"anvil\" (*nakovalo), \"coasă\" \"scythe\" (*kosa), \"tocilă\" \"grindstone\" (*točilo), \"greblă\" \"rake\", \"potcoavă\" \"horseshoe\" (*podъkova), \"zabrea\" \"trellis\".\n\nThe names of some animals, birds, fish, and plants made a transition from the Slavic: \"vrabie\" \"sparrow\" (Proto-Slavic *vorbь), \"lebădă\" \"swan\" (*olbǫdь, *elbedь), \"vidră\" \"otter\" (*vydra), \"știucă\" \"pike\" (*ščuka), \"rac\" \"crayfish\" (*rakъ), \"păianjen\" \"spider\" (*paǫkъ), \"lobodă\" \"pigweed\" (*loboda), \"bob\" \"seed, bean\" (*bobъ), \"morcov\" \"carrot\" (*mъrky, *mъrkъv-), \"sfeclă\" \"beets\" (*svekla), \"hreniță\" \"water cress\" (*xrěnъ), \"râs\" \"lynx\" (*rysь).\n\nThere are some Onomatopoeic verbs and other words, such as \"a plescăi\" \"splash\" (*pleskati), \"a tropoti\" \"clatter\", \"a clocoti\" \"to boil over\" (*klokotati), are closer to their Slavic than their western Romance equivalents (compare Spanish: chapoteo/roción; susurro/murmurro; eco; pataleo/trapa trapa). Certain interjections, such as \"ba!\" \"oh yes!\" are taken from the Old Slavic (mostly Old Bulgarian) language.\n\nBorrowings from Church Slavonic include the following synonyms: \"a izbăvi\" (< \"избавити\") \"to deliver, redeem\", \"veșnic\" (< \"вѣчьнъ\", \"вѣчный\") \"forever, perpetual, undying\", \"sfânt\" (a corruption of Latin \"sanctus\" and Church Slavonic \"свѧтъ\", \"свѧтый\") \"holy, saint\", \"a sluji\" (< \"служити\") \"to serve\", \"rai\" (< \"рай\") \"paradise\", \"iad\" (< \"адъ\") \"hell\", \"proroc\" (< \"пророкъ\") \"prophet\", \"hram\" (< \"храмъ\") \"church patron\", \"duhovnic\" (< \"духовникъ\") \"confessor\", \"dihanie\" \"wild beast, monster\".\n\nSlavic (synonym) terminology is almost exclusive when used to assign titles and ranks to medieval nobility: \"boier\" \"boyar\", \"cneaz\" \"knyaz\", \"rob\" \"slave\" (*orbъ), \"slugă\" \"servant\" (*sluga), \"a sluji\" \"to serve\" (*služiti), etc. It is also used to describe urban life and finances which emerged with the arrival of the Slavs: \"a plăti\" \"pay\" (*platiti), \"târg\" \"market\" (*tъrgъ), \"rând\" \"row\" ( *rędъ), \"sticlă\" \"glass\" (*stьklo). Seafaring concepts have also some Slavic-borrowed synonyms: \"corabie\" \"ship\" (*korabjь), \"lotcă\" \"boat\" (*oldьja, *oldъka), and \"vâslă\" \"oar\" (*veslo) all come from their Slavic equivalents virtually unaltered.\n\nMany Romanian names were also influenced by the use of Old Bulgarian in Church and in administration. Over time, especially after the Latin alphabet was adopted, some Slavic words became archaic, but others have maintained a quite widespread use. In general, most Slavic borrowings have become well incorporated into Romanian and are no longer perceived as foreign by the Orthodox practicants. In fact, many Romanian words occur as a natural combination of Slavic and Romance elements: \"devreme\" \"early\", \"așijderea\" \"likewise\", \"a se îmbolnăvi\" \"to fall ill\", \"a împleti\" \"to weave\", \"a învârti\" \"to turn, rotate\", \"a îmbogăți\" \"to enrich\", \"nebunie\" \"craziness\", \"răzbunare\" \"revenge\", \"răscruce\" \"crossing\", \"prietenos\" \"friendly\", \"bunică\" \"granny\", \"portiță\" \"wicket\", \"româncă\" \"Romanian woman\", \"neașteptat\" \"unexpected\", \"nerușinat\" \"unashamed\", \"citire\" \"reading\", \"iubită\" \"girlfriend\", \"iubesc\" \"I love\", \"prostie\" \"foolishness\", \"hulubărie\" \"dove-cot\" (synonym), \"slăbiciune\" \"weakness\", \"milos\" \"charitable\".\n\nThe indirect Slavic influence on Romanian words and expressions is also important. Many words and expressions were calqued from their Slavic equivalents or created to reproduce the patterns of Slavic speech. Words such as \"suflet\" (\"soul\") copy the logic of the Slavic word \"душа\", and the original Latin \"anima\" shifted its meaning to \"inimă\" (\"heart\"). Other examples include \"lună\" (meaning \"month\" and \"the moon\") and \"lume\" (originally \"light\"), used in the sense of \"the world\". Certain expressions (such as \"din topor\", \"unrefined\") also tend to be similar to their Slavic equivalents: \"топорный = грубый\".\n\nAnother feature of modern Romanian which has resulted from contact with Slavic speakers is the formation of numerals from 11 to 20. For instance, \"unsprezece\" (\"eleven\") is based on three components (\"un+spre+zece\", \"one above [from Latin \"super\"] ten\"). Although the elements are Romance in origin, the model is a word-by-word imitation of the Slavic \"един+на+десет\" (\"one above ten\", Bulgarian: единадесет) not found in the West, where original whole Latin words were preserved ().\n\nAs a result of the once imposed Old Church Slavonic via the First and Second Bulgarian Empires, most Slavic borrowings in Romanian are well-preserved phonetically and have changed little over the centuries. Some phonetic adjustment has taken place in certain cases: \"ohileti > a ofili\", \"ljubiti> a iubi\", \"protiva > potrivă\", \"podkova > potcoavă\". Other Slavic borrowings changed their original meanings after being incorporated into Romanian speech, for example \"a găsi\" \"to find\" < гасить \"to extinguish\", \"a lovi\" \"to strike\" < ловить \"to catch\", \"clipă\" \"moment\" < клепание \"rhythmic movement\".\nSlavic speech patterns have also influenced Vulgar Latin-inherited words and borrowing from other languages, for instance Latin \"schola/scola\" > Slav. школа, \"shkola\" > modern Romanian \"școală\" \"school\". Had the original Latin word been preserved in post-Roman Dacia, it would have most likely resulted in the hypothetical \"*scoară\".\n\nSlavic borrowings in Romanian help reveal the historical development of the language, although it is sometimes difficult to determine cause and effect in some developments. Whatever the cause or effect, the migration of Slavs separated the Haemus (Balkan) Latin from Western Romance and a proto-Romanian language differentiated from the Western Romance. By the sixth century the shift of the intervocal l>r (\"solis>soare\"; \"an, am, in, im > ân, în; si>și\") stopped; new borrowings from Old Slavonic do not undergo the process: сила > \"silă\" instead of the hypothetical \"*șiră\". New developments, such as sv>sf and h>f, occur instead. One example is \"sfântu\", \"saint\", from Slavonic \"svętŭ\", where a nasal \"n\" that has been lost in all Slavic languages except Polish (\"święty\", i.e., \"świenty\") made its way into the Romanian borrowing.\n\nThe affirmative particle \"da\" \"yes\" is of Slavic influence, although its existence in the Romanian vocabulary could have Latin routes. Romanians came to use the word as their common form of \"yes\" because their Slavic neighbours were using \"da\", rather than settle on a version of \"sic\" as in other Romance languages (Romanian \"și\" instead is used to mean \"and\"). Another example is the common Romanian surname ending \"-escu\", which is of Latin origin (French \"-esque\", as in \"Romanesque\", or Italian \"-esco\", as in \"romanesco\" or \"tedesco\" \"German\"), but came to be used more, possibly in imitation of Church Slavonic -ьskъ (as with \"slověnьskъ\", \"Slavonic\"). As with \"sfântu\" above, this seems to predate the common shift of the Slavic languages into preferring \"slověnьskъij\" over \"slověnьskъ\", from whence the common Slavic surname ending -ski (-ский).\n\nThe share of Slavic words in Romanian differs by dialect and style. The number of Slavicisms is higher in border regions with significant Slavic-speaking populations. In spoken Romanian, their share is between 5 percent in Romania and up to 20 percent in the Republic of Moldova, where Russian borrowings and constructions and minor Ukrainian loanwords are common within simple, less educated population and even most of the population as a whole, as Moldova is a multilingual country (compare \"Vreau un holodilnic\" and \"Vreau un frigider\"). In written Romanian, their share is somewhat lower (around 3 percent); Latin-based words represent over 90 percent in current language, with the remaining percent of Greek, Hungarian, and Turkish origin synonyms and words and from the Dacian substratum. This is because Romanian borrowed words from Classical Latin (the standard dialect of Latin), after Latin did hold an important position in Transylvania after the 12th century, and a part of Romanian vocabulary of Slavic origin is colloquial.\n\nIn modern spoken and literary Romanian, Slavonic influences are evident in phonetics and morphology (influenced by Slavic speakers, while Slavic words became Latinized in phonetics). Phonetic Slavicisms include the iotation of the initial \"e\" in words such as \"el\", \"ea\", \"este\" pronounced (compare , without the Slavic iotation effect) and the palatalization of consonants in the plural form (for example \"pom-pomi\" and \"lup-lupi\", pronounced and ; compare the original Italian sound in \"lupi\"). Several Slavic prefixes and suffixes, such as \"ne-\", \"-că\", \"-iță\", \"răs-/răz-\", have become part of the Romanian lexis; \"-că\" and \"-iţă\" are markers of the feminine gender in Romanian morphology (\"lup-lupoaică\", \"italian-italiancă\", \"actor-actriță\"). Unlike Western Romance languages, Romanian is unusual in how its nouns undergo internal vowel modifications while being inflected (\"fată-fete, gheață-ghețuri\"). This feature is common in neighboring Slavic languages: \"лёд-льда, сон-сны, день-дни\". These changes indicate that, unlike later-arriving Hungarians, local Slavs who settled in the Vlach lands learned Balkan Latin. This process infused Romanian with Slavic features, while leading to the assimilation of Slavs north of the Danube.\n\nAs in the Western Romance languages, the Latin sound \"h\" was lost in early Balkan Latin between the 3rd and 5th centuries (for example, \"hibernum\" > Romanian \"iarnă\" and Spanish \"invierno\", \"winter\"). However, Slavic influence after the 6th century led to a reintroduction of the Slavic hard \"h\" sound into Romanian. Therefore, excepting recent neologisms, most Romanian words beginning with \"h\" are Slavic in origin: \"hram\", \"hrană\", \"hulubărie\", \"hrean\". One counterexample is \"hartă\", \"map\", which is \"carta\" in both Italian and all surrounding Slavic languages which borrowed the word (as \"karta\").\n\nThe addition of Slavic verb stems ending in \"-i\" (\"a iubi\", \"a citi\", \"a goni\", \"a izbi\", \"a răni\", \"a primi\") and \"-î\" (\"a posomorî\", \"a omorî\", \"a târî\") has led to an expansion of this conjugation pattern in Romanian, applied especially to Slavic borrowed verbs: \"a opri\", \"a zdrobi\", \"a toropi\", \" a osteni\", \"a podi\", \"a vărui\", \"a beli\", \"a cerni\", \"a plesni\", \"a coji\", \"a ţocăi\", \"a născoci\", \"a grohăi\", \"a glumi\", \"a trudi\". By contrast, in Western Romance languages the number of verbs in the original Latin \"-i\" group shrank with time.\n\nThe tendency of late Latin was to drop all noun cases and redistribute the neutral gender between masculine and feminine (as in all modern Western Romance languages). Slavic influence has kept Romanian from losing these features. Certain indirect sentence structures—such as \"mi-e bine\" and \"mi-e frig\" (literally \"cold is to me\") are also Slavic-influenced (compare \"dobro mi je\" and \"hladno mi je\"). In the Western Romance direct constructions are used instead (, or and ). The preservation of cases and the neutral gender has also occurred under Slavic influence, and is not observed in modern Western Romance. Romanian has also developed a Slavic-influenced vocative case, ending in \"-o\": \"Fetițo!\".\n\nThe sustainability of Slavic elements in Romanian is also evident in the toponymics of Romania and Moldova. Despite the fact that Dacia was a core of the empire's influence, the Romance-speaking population left the original Roman cities after the decline of the Roman Empire and the great migrations and shifted to rural cattle-breeding in 'villa' properties (see village) and to the south of Danube. South of the Danube, where South Slavs eventually settled, the Romanian (Vlach) population was outnumbered and partially assimilated; the processes of linguistic exchange in the Balkans appear to be unequal, most likely due to social and political circumstances. As a result, no original Roman place names survived north of the Danube. Newly founded settlements were largely a result of Slavic (and, later, Hungarian) presence. A lot of new Slavic place names were given to (old) cities and villages throughout Romania and Moldova: \"Cernavodă\", \"Prilog\", \"Dumbrava\", \"Bistrița\", \"Talna\", \"Rus\", \"Bistra\", \"Glod\", \"Ruscova\", \"Straja\", \"Putna\", \"Hulub\", \"Bâc\", \"Tecuci\", \"Potcoava\", \"Corabia\", \"Lipova\", \"Holod\", \"Topila\", \"Ostrovu\". These new place names survived as the cohabitation with the assimilating Slavs was less contradictory compared to that with Avars, Pechenegs, Hungarians, etc.\n\n"}

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \"he said\" becoming \"Jesus said\").\n\nOrigen, writing in the 3rd century, was one of the first who made remarks about differences between manuscripts of texts that were eventually collected as the New Testament. He declared his preferences among variant readings. For example, in , he favored \"Barabbas\" against \"Jesus Barabbas\" (\"In Matt. Comm. ser.\" 121). In , he preferred \"Bethabara\" over \"Bethany\" as the location where John was baptizing (\"Commentary on John\" VI.40 (24)). \"Gergeza\" was preferred over \"Geraza\" or \"Gadara\" (\"Commentary on John\" VI.40 (24) – see ). At Hebrews 2:9, Origen noticed two different readings: \"apart from God\" and \"by the grace of God\".\n\nJohn Mill's 1707 Greek New Testament was estimated to contain some 30,000 variants in its accompanying textual apparatus which was based on \"nearly 100 [Greek] manuscripts.\" Eberhard Nestle estimated this number in 1897 as 150,000–200,000 variants. In 2005, Bart D. Ehrman reported estimates from 200,000 to 400,000 variants based on 5,700 Greek and 10,000 Latin manuscripts, various other ancient translations, and quotations by the Church Fathers. In 2014 Eldon J. Epp raised the estimate as high as 750,000. The most recent estimate puts the number of non-spelling variants among New Testament manuscripts around 500,000.\n\nSince 1981, in a system developed and introduced by Kurt and Barbara Aland in their textbook \"The text of the New Testament\", Greek New Testament manuscripts have commonly been categorized into five groups.\n\nAn abbreviated list of textual variants in the New Testament is given in this article (below).\n\n\n (see Isaiah 40:3)\n\n\n\n"}
