The Beni Snous had no trouble conversing with their Berber-speaking neighbours among the Beni Bou Said just to the west, and (with some difficulty) could communicate in Berber with people from Figuig, Beni Iznacen, and the Zekkara, across the border in Morocco. However, they found Tashelhiyt (in southern Morocco) and Kabyle (in central Algeria) almost unintelligible.\n\nToday, only a few elderly people in the region still speak Berber.

Bogons include IP packets on the public Internet that contain addresses that are not in any range allocated or delegated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or a delegated regional Internet registry (RIR) and allowed for public internet use. The areas of unallocated address space are called the bogon space.\n\nBogons also include reserved private address and link-local address ranges, such as those in , , , and , which are reserved for private networks, sometimes also known as Martian packets.\n\nMany ISPs and end-user firewalls filter and block bogons, because they have no legitimate use, and usually are the result of accidental or malicious misconfiguration. Bogons can be filtered by using router access control lists (ACLs), or by BGP blackholing.\n\nIP addresses that are currently in the bogon space may not be bogons at a later date because IANA and other registries frequently assign new address space to ISPs. Announcements of new assignments are often published on network operators' mailing lists (such as NANOG) to ensure that operators have a chance to remove bogon filtering for addresses that have become legitimate.\n\nFor example, addresses in were not allocated prior to August 2010, but are now used by APNIC. As time goes on, the IPv4 address exhaustion will mean there are fewer and fewer IPv4 bogons.\n\nIANA maintains a list of allocated and reserved IPv4 netblocks.\n\n, the IETF recommends that since there are no longer any unallocated IPv4 s, bogon filters based on registration status should be removed.\nHowever, bogon filters still need to check for Martians.\n\nThe term \"bogon\" stems from hacker jargon, where it is defined as the quantum of \"bogosity\", or the property of being bogus. A bogon packet is frequently bogus both in the conventional sense of being forged for illegitimate purposes, and in the hackish sense of being incorrect, absurd, and useless.\n\n\n"}

Each unit consists of one or more inclined runways. Merchandise is loaded in the rear of each runway. As an item is removed from the front, the item directly behind it slides forward in place of the previous.\n\nThe main advantage of carton flow rack over static rack or shelving systems is that merchandise remains better organized and easier to find or pick. With carton flow rack, the product is automatically rotated on a first-in, first-out basis. Merchandise is stocked in the rear of the carton flow rack and moves toward the picking station in front on an inclined shelf equipped with specially designed roller track. When a carton is removed from the picking station, the next one in line rolls to the front. Carton flow always keeps items within reach. Inventory is easier to monitor and control since products are fully visible at all times. A limitation worth mentioning is that carton flows are not well suited for larger volume or full case applications. \nRestocking and picking typically offer the greatest opportunity for improving efficiency within order-picking operations. With carton flow rack systems, labor savings of up to 75% can be realized almost immediately. Because items are picked from the front and stocked from the rear, both functions can be performed without interference and with minimized travel.\n\nIn a static storage system such as standard shelving, stockers and pickers often do a lot of unnecessary travel.\n\nLansing Peter Shield, President of Grand Union Co., applied for patents for the original gravity-feed rear-load design using Unistrut and Nylon strips in 1945 (later approved in 1948). The unit consisted of several inclined runways. The device was driven by gravity. A stockman would place merchandise in the rear of each runway and, as a shopper selected an item, the item behind it would slide forward in place of the previous one.\n\nGrand Union formed a company called Food-O-Mat to sell the carton flow system, and made Gardner Hinckley the president. Gauer Metal Products, Inc manufactured the carton flow units for Grand Union/Food-O-Mat. When Lansing Shield died of a heart attack, Thomas Butler was appointed the new president. Butler had no interest in continuing to use carton flow units in Grand Union supermarkets, so Food-O-Mat went off on its own to sell the product with Gauer Metal Products as its manufacturer.\n\nThe carton flow design has gone through countless changes over the years, and has now evolved to full shelving units. These units consist of polyethylene or aluminum roller runways and can be stand-alone racks or can be installed into pallet racks. Conveyor systems are sometimes used as an alternative option to carton flow shelving.\n\nhttps://advancestorageproducts.com/flow-systems-types/carton-flow<\n"}

The beam is used to support the ship's anchor when raising it (weighing anchor) or lowering it (letting go), and for carrying the anchor on its stock-end when suspended outside the ship's side. It is furnished with sheaves at the outer end, and the inner end (which is called the cat's-tail) fits down on the cat-beam. The cat stopper also fastens the anchor on. The purpose of the cathead is to provide both a heavy enough beam to support the massive weight of the anchor, and to hold the metal anchor away from the wooden side of the ship to prevent damage.\n\nIn common practice, the projecting end of the beam was carved to resemble the face of a lion or cat. Whether such carving was due to a play on the already existing name of the beam or whether the beam was so named because of the practice of such carving is unknown.\n\nThe origin of the term \"cathead\" is obscure, but dates at least to the 17th century used by \"mainwaring\" and \"boteler\" in their dictionaries.\n\nIn Robert Charles Leslie's \"Old Sea Wings, Ways and Words in the Days of Oak and Hemp\" (1890), page 154 he writes: \"The term catheads used for the two stout projecting timbers on either bow, from which the anchor hung clear of the ship before letting go, was no doubt connected with the fact of a lion or large cat usually carved upon the end of the item.\"\n\nA second \"cat head\" was associated with a ship's anchor-cable and windlass. This was a square pin thrust into one of the handspike holes of a ship's windlass. When at anchor, the anchor rope (called a cable or catfall) was secured to this with a smaller rope tie called a seizing. The English term for this pin was 'Norman'. In German, however, it was called a \"Kattenkopf\" (cat-head), and in this case it is a reference to the traditional way the top was notched and chamfered off so that in cross section, it resembled the ears of a cat.\n"}

Ananthamurthy (1993). He is known for effective adaptation of the North Karnataka dialect of the Kannada language in his plays, and poems, in a similar style as in the works of D.R. Bendre.\n\nKambara's plays mainly revolve around folk or mythology interlinked with contemporary issues, inculcating modern lifestyle with his hard-hitting poems. He has become a pioneer of such literature. His contribution as a playwright is significant not only to Kannada theatre but also to the Indian theatre in general as he achieved a blend of the folk and the modern theatrical forms.\n\nHe has been conferred with many prestigious awards including the Jnanpith Award in 2011 for the year 2010, Sahitya Akademi Award, the Padma Shri by Government of India, Kabir Samman, Kalidas Samman and Pampa Award. After his retirement, Kambara was nominated as the Member of Karnataka Legislative Council, to which he made significant contributions through his interventions.\n\nChandrashekhara Kambara was born in Ghodageri, a village in Belgaum district of Bombay Presidency (today in Karnataka). He was the third son in the family, with brothers Parasappa and Yallappa who still reside in the small house belonging to the Kambara family in the village. From an early age, Kambara was interested in folk arts, local culture and ritual. His favorite Kannada writers include Kumara Vyasa, Basava, Kuvempu and Gopalakrishna Adiga and among English writers, it is W. B. Yeats, William Shakespeare and Federico García Lorca.\n\nPopularly known as \"Shivapur Kambar Master\" in his native district, Kambara had his schooling in Gokak and returned to Belagavi for higher education at Lingaraj College. Owing to poverty, he had to drop out of school but Jagadguru Siddaram Swamiji of Savalagi Matha blessed Kambara and took care of all his primary and high school educational expenses which is why Kambara honours the seer in many of his writings. After his post-graduation, he did his PhD thesis on \"Uttara Karnatakada Janapad Rangbhumi\" (\"The Folk Theatre of North Karnataka\") from Karnataka University, Dharwad.\n\nAfter a brief stint in teaching in the University of Chicago, he taught in Bangalore University for over two decades and was a Fulbright scholar.\n\nHe has been elected as the chairman of Sahitya Academny on 12 February 2018.\n\nHe served as the chairman of National School of Drama Society, New Delhi from 1996 to 2000 and as the president of Karnataka Nataka Academy from 1980 to 1983. He started using north Karnataka dialect of Kannada in his poems and plays which is not very common in Kannada literature.\n\nKambara is the founder vice-chancellor of the Kannada University at Hampi. His grand vision of Kannada literature and Karnataka culture is reflected in the way he showed commitment to build it. The architecture, the choice of the subjects that cover the diverse variety of culture and society of Karnataka, selection of place, faculty or academic activities, the scholars whom he drafted from different parts of the state and the Nadoja honorary award instead of the honorary doctorate which he introduced, show Kambara's native vision which was evolved in his literary works for decades.\n\nAs the first vice-chancellor of the University, Kambara served two terms of three years each, during which he could shape it in a unique manner, compared to other traditional universities. All the constructions during his tenure as the vice-chancellor are on hillocks, with huge stone structures resembling the Vijayanagara period architecture. He also created a separate publication unit for publishing the results of research and project works going on in Kannada University.\n\nHe is a strong supporter of imparting school education with Kannada language as the medium of instruction. His justification for this stance is that only mother tongue can provide an \"experience,\" which is an integral part of learning and learning through any other language only gives people \"information,\" which makes them less competent. This concurs with UNESCO's recommendation that \"providing education in a child's mother tongue is a critical issue.\"\n\nKambara has to his credit 25 plays, 11 anthologies of poems, 5 novels, 16 research works and several scholarly write-ups on folk theatre, literature and education. Some of his popular plays include \"Jokumaraswamy\", \"Jayasidnayaka\", \"Kadu Kudure\", \"Nayi Kathe\", \"Mahamayi\", \"Harakeya Kuri\" and others. He was conferred with the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1991 for another popular play \"Sirisampige\".\n\nHe was a pioneer in introducing Bailahongal's famous \"Sangya Balya\" (bayalata) and \"Jokumaraswamy,\" a traditional ritual of his native district, to the literary world which have seen thousands of performances, not only in Kannada, but several other Indian languages as well. His most recent novel, \"Shikhar Soorya\", is rated among the best Kannada novels.\n\nMany of his works have been translated to English and several other Indian languages. The play \"Jokumaraswamy\" has been translated to English (Seagull Books, Calcutta in 1989), Marathi (Abholi Prakashan, Solhapur in 2000), Hindi (Vidya Prakashan Mandir, New Delhi in 1985), Telugu (Mudrika Printers, Kurnool in 1993), Tamil, Punjabi and Malayalam among others. The Sahitya Akademi Award-winning play \"Sirisampige\" has been translated to English (Seagull Books) and to Tamil, Hindi, Marathi and Rajasthani by the Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi. \"Kulothe Chingaramma\", which was translated to Malayalam by C Raghavan, is one of his works that has become popular in Kerala.\n\nApart from his literary career, Kambara has been associated with direction of feature films. His directorial work in many movies on the plays scripted by him; he has directed films such as Karimayi, Sangeeta and Kadu Kudare. Jeeke Maastara and Pranaya Prasanga two of his plays which have been made into television serils. His contributions include many documentaries for the Government of Karnataka and Government of India. His \"Kaadu Kudure\" entered into the Indian Panorama and won the National Award. His film \"Sangeeta\" won the Best Feature Film State Award in the year 1981. He has also adopted his play \"G.K. Maasthara Pranaya Prasanga\" for television.\n\nBesides his voluminous works, Kambar has presented papers on Indian Folklore and theatre in the University of Chicago, American Oriental Centre, New York, International Theatre Institute – Berlin, Moscow, and Jade: Akita Japan and many Universities and cultural organizations in India. The Folklore Dictionary he compiled for Kannada Sahitya Parishad is a monumental work.\n\nIn his lengthy narrative poem \"Helatena Kela\" (\"Listen, I will tell you\") in the early 1960s, Kambara introduced some of the recurring themes which he would often return to in his later works. Themes of tradition and modernity, crises of feudalism, native identities, colonialism, march of history, sex, loss of faith, the death of God and several related themes explored later in his plays, novels and poetry had found metaphorical expression in the narrative poem. The eponymous, long narrative poem has the musicality and rhythm of the Lavani form and uses rich earthy imagery.\n\n\"Shivapura\" is an imaginary utopian village which continues to be a character, a metaphor and the locale in most of his works. It forms the locus of his poems and tales. In his characterisation, Lord Shiva and Parvati visit the place and bless the villagers. Even Rama, when he was going to Sri Lanka in search of Sita, visits the village en route.\n\n\nFive of his books have been awarded by the Karnataka Sahitya Academy. His well-known play \"Jokumaraswamy\" has won the \"Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya Award\" of \"Natya Sangh\" as the \"Best Play of the Year\" in India in the year 1975. Another popular play \"Jaisidanayaka\" won the \"Vardhamaana Prasasti\" as the \"Best Book of the Year\" – 1975 in Karnataka.\n\nHis \"Saavirada Neralu\" won the \"Ashan Award\" (Kerala) as the best collection of poems in 1982. He won the K.V. Shankare Gowda Award for Theatre in 1990. He is the recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, New Delhi, for playwrighting in the year 1983 and the Sahitya Akademi Award, New Delhi, for the play \"Siri Sampige\" in 1991.\n\nKambara received the eighth Jnanpith Award for the Kannada language, the highest literary honour conferred in India, in September 2011 for the year 2010. The prestigious award which was instituted in 1961, carries a cheque for 750,000, a citation and a bronze replica of goddess Vagdevi. The Chief Minister of Karnataka, D. V. Sadananda Gowda was among the many dignitaries who wished him on the occasion of receiving this award. At a felicitation ceremony held a week after winning the award, the Government of Karnataka announced that it will reprint all works of Kambara, including his plays and make them available at all government school libraries. His works will also be translated to different languages. A drama festival featuring his plays will be staged to honour the laureate.\n\nHis rich contribution to Kannada literature in the field of poetry, plays, novels and stories, and on his research and political perceptions are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

An early origin tale known as \"Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde\", which survives only as part of the Irish genealogical tract in MS Laud 610, includes a few brief notes on the saint. This text was probably written at St Colmán's foundation of Cloyne and though it cannot be precisely dated, a rough approximate of \"c\". 700 or earlier has been suggested.\n\nIrish genealogies generally agree that Colmán had a father called Lénín. Through his father, Colmán appears to have been descended from the Rothrige, an obscure people who are known elsewhere as a subject people of the Déisi of Munster. Irish genealogies, however, go some way to associating Colmán's lineage with the Éoganachta, the leading ruling dynasty in Munster. One early item of genealogical information, which specifically identifies the Mac Léníni and Mac Duinich as sub-branches of the Rothrige (though it does not name Colmán), achieves this by making their eponymous progenitor Eochaid Rothán a son of the Éoganacht ancestor Mug Nuadat. The saint's genealogies later come to trace Colmán's ancestry to Mug Nuadat through seven generations. This prominence accorded to the Éoganachta in the genealogies is to be seen in the light of Colmán's monastic career and the position of Cloyne after his death (see below).\n\nThe text \"Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde\" includes a brief triad in which Colmán is named as one of the three \"ex-laymen\" (\"athláich\") of Ireland, along with Énna of Aran and Móchammac of Inis Celtra (though it also adds a fourth, Bishop Erc in Sláne of Mag Breg). The use of the word \"athláech\" here has been taken to suggest that Colmán became a cleric at a somewhat later age than was usual at the time. Later tradition claims that it was the Connacht saint Brendan of Clonfert who finally persuaded him to do so.\n\nColmán is remembered as the founder of the monastery at Cluain Uama, now Cloyne (Co. Cork, Ireland), in Munster, which lay in the kingdom of the Uí Liatháin and the Uí Meic Caille, a sept of the former. The origin legend \"Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde\" claims that the land for the foundation was not given by the local king, but by Coirpre (Crom) mac Crimthainn (d. \"c\". 580), who was king of Munster from the Eóganacht Glendamnach:\nAired Cechtraige has been identified as the later parish of Erry in the barony of Middlethird, and Cell Náile as that of Killenaule, in the barony of Ardagh, both in the diocese of Cashel.\n\nThe same text alludes to Colmán's conflicts with other rulers. Colmán and his brothers are said at one time to have been expelled from \"Maethalach\" by Máel Umai, the son of Coirpre's brother Fiachna Onchind; for this reason, his descendants were forever excluded from royal rule. Earlier in the text, Colmán is also said to have uttered a curse (\"maledictio\") which brought down the walls of the city of Ress or Ressad. According to Paul MacCotter, Ress(ad) appears to be \"an archaic name for Uí Chairpre or one of its divisions\", the Uí Chairpre being a prominent sept of the Uí Fidgenti in Co. Limerick.\n\nCloyne appears to have been his earliest settlement. The cathedral and round tower are situated on a limestone eminence in the midst of the valley, surrounded by rich meadows. In the rock is the cave extending in various branches underground to a great distance, from which the town derives its name. Here it is supposed Colman took up his abode as a place of security and the remains of his primitive oratory, known as Colman's Chapel were still to be seen in 1813. Colmán is also believed to have founded a monastery at what would become Killagha Abbey in County Kerry.\n\nFurther details of his life are not documented in writing but the connection of many places in counties Cork and Limerick with his name to this day proves the reality of his labours. The tenth-century Triads describes Cloyne as an important law school.\n\nHe was credited with extraordinary poetic powers, being styled by his contemporaries 'royal poet of Munster'. Several of his Irish poems are still extant, notably a metrical panegyric on Saint Brendan. Colgan mentions a metrical life of Saint Senan by him.\n\nIt is unclear whether he was brought up as a Christian, but what is sure is that he was educated and became a bard or \"file\", which required a special education - (in order to reach the highest level of \"file\" 12 years of study were required.) As a member of the class of \"filí\", he became attached to the court of Cashel where he remained until about the age of 48 years. In 570 he and Saint Brendan of Clonfert were said to have settled a dispute between rivals to the throne of Cashel and Aodh Caomh was acknowledged as king - the first Christian king of Cashel. The King was installed by Saint Brendan. During the time of the coronation Colman and some others discovered the lost shrine of Ailbhe of Emly. Brendan said that it was not right that the hands which had held this sacred relic should be defiled henceforth, thus it was that the son of Leinin offered himself to God. Brendan blessed him and gave him the name Colmán, which is a diminutive of Colm. The Gaelic word \"colm\" corresponds to the Latin \"columba\" (dove).\n\nColman then went to the school of Saint Iarlaithe of Tuam and after his studies he is next mentioned as preaching to the heathen population in the east of County Cork. He is described as a \"religious and holy presbyter, who afterwards became a famous bishop\". The Prince of Déise, in the present County of Waterford, presented his child to Colman for baptism. Colman baptized him Declan and urged his parents to educate him well in his faith. This child became Saint Declan.\n\nColman was given churches in Erry and Killenaule (4 and 10 miles from Cashel respectively) by Coirpre Cromm mac Crimthainn, King of Munster (Cashel), as well as lands in Cloyne, Co. Cork. It may well be that the lands in Cloyne (Cluain Uama, the lawn of the cave), were conquered lands and to prevent the possibility of reconquest were given to the church. The Cloyne estate was large and contained some of the best land in the area.\n\nAfter the king's death (c. 580) Colman somehow became involved in factional strife between Coirpre's descendants in which some of them persecuted him while others, the ancestors of the later dominant line, protected him.\n\nHis surviving verses date from the period 565 and 604, and are among the earliest examples of Irish writing in the Latin alphabet. He is commonly thought to have composed \"Luin oc laib\", a poem in praise of Domnall mac Muirchertaig (d. 566?), king of Tara, and another poem on the death of Áed Sláine (d. 604), king of the UÍ Néill. The latter poem has not survived complete.\n\nHe died on 24 November (his subsequent feastday), circa 600, and his probable place of burial is Cloyne, where he may have left a school of poetry in existence. The calendars are unanimous in dating his death on 24 November, now his feast day. Patron Saint of the Diocese of Cloyne and of its cathedral in Cóbh.\n\nA different Saint Colman is also venerated on the same day, as recorded by Saint Aengus in his \"Felire\": – Mac Lenine the most excellent With Colman of Duth-chuilleann. Saint Colman lived in a time for which we have very little written history. The received picture of Colman Mac Leinin comes to us from nineteenth and twentieth century Hagiographies.\n\n\n\n"}

Cratylus is more popularly known as Socrates' antagonist in Plato's dialogue. Vaguely exegetical, Cratylism holds that the fluid nature of ideas, words, and communications leaves them fundamentally baseless, and possibly unable to support logic and reason. It is distinguished from linguisticity by the problematic status of style - that in a natural language, where a perfect connection is found between word and things, variations of style are no longer conceivable.\n\nGerard Genette divided the theory into primary and secondary Cratylism. The former is said to involve a general attempt to establish a motivated link between the signifier and the signified by inventing emotional values for certain sounds while the latter admits that language has fallen and that the signifier enjoys an arbitrary relation to the signified.\n\nCratylism reaches similar conclusions about the nature of reality and communication that Taoism and Zen Buddhism also confronted: how can a mind in flux, in a flowing world, hold on to any solid \"truth\" and convey it to another mind?\n\nA fellow-Greek sophist, Gorgias, expressed an equally ironic \"cul de sac\" conclusion about the nature of human epistemological understanding: \n\n\"Nothing exists. Even if something did exist, nothing can be known about it; and even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it cannot be communicated to others. And, finally, even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "4202524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4202524", "title": "Epideictic", "text": "Epideictic\n\nThe epideictic oratory, also called ceremonial oratory, or praise-and-blame rhetoric, is one of the three branches, or \"species\" (eidē), of rhetoric as outlined in Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\", to be used to praise or blame during ceremonies.\n\nThe term's root has to do with display or show (\"deixis\"). It is a literary or rhetorical term from the Greek (ἐπιδεικτικός). It is generally pronounced or . Another English form, now less common, is \"epidictic\" .\n\nThis is rhetoric of ceremony, commemoration, declamation, demonstration, on the one hand, and of play, entertainment, display, including self-display. It is also the rhetoric used at festivals, the Olympic games, state visits and other formal events like openings, closings, anniversaries as well as at births, deaths, or marriages. Its major subject is praise and blame, according to Aristotle in the limited space he provides for it in the \"Art of Rhetoric\" (Freese translation). \n\nThis rhetoric deals with goodness, excellence, nobility, shame, honor, dishonor, beauty, and matters of virtue and vice. The virtues or the \"components\" of virtue according to Aristotle, were \"justice, courage, self-control, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, practical and speculative wisdom\" or \"reason\". Vice was the \"contrary\" of virtue. \n\nIn his book \"Rhetoric and Poetics in Antiquity\", Jeffrey Walker claims that epideictic rhetoric predates the rhetoric of courts and politics, the study of which began in the 5th or 4th century BC with the Sophists. The other two kinds of public speech were deliberative or political speech, and forensic, judicial, or legal speech. Epideictic rhetoric or style is according to Aristotle most appropriate for material that is written or read. In the \"Art of Rhetoric\", Aristotle stated that \"The epideictic style is especially suited to written compositions; for its function is reading.\" (423)\n\nAristotle instructs that in creating a speech of praise or blame, the author should consider the attitude of his audience: Will they be moved to see his object of praise (be it a person or a thing) in a new light, or will he be wasting everyone's time by \"preaching to the choir\"? What values and behavior does this particular audience find praiseworthy? Whether the audience is sympathetic, hostile, or indifferent to his object of praise or blame determines how difficult the task is that lies before him. As Aristotle reminds the reader, \"[F]or as Socrates used to say, it is not difficult to praise Athenians in Athens\" (\"Rhetoric\",1367b). \n\nAccording to Aristotle’s conception of epideixis, “the present is the most important; for all speakers praise or blame in regard to existing qualities, but they often make use of other things, both reminding [the audience] of the past and projecting the course of the future” (\"Rhet.\" 1358b). Epideixis is Aristotle’s least favored and clearly defined topic. Now considered to be the stuff of ceremonies with its exhortations, panegyrics, encomia, funeral orations and displays of oratorical prowess, epideictic rhetoric appears to most to be discourse less about depth and more attuned to style without substance. Still, the \"Art of Rhetoric\" is cited as an example of epideictic work (Lockwood, 1996).\n\nEpideixis may not deserve the charge of lacking depth. The charge that this branch of rhetoric lacks depth can be countered by the recognition that it systematizes the successful attribution of value (to things, people, or concepts). Attributing value (whether in terms of \"the good\" and \"the bad\" or of \"virtue\" and \"vice\") to 1) perception, 2) emotions, 3) thought, 4) action, and 5) goals is the fundamental basis of relativistic conceptions of 1) aesthetics, 2) human character, 3) intelligence, 4) ethics, and 5) wisdom. For instance, applying epideixis to 'human perceptions' yields aesthetics, and its application to 'human action' yields fundamental relativistic ethics. Nevertheless, epideixis can always be reduced to simply the study of how best to preach the positive or negative characteristics of creatures, contraptions, concepts (etc.) to an audience. Epideictic rhetoric appeals to - and serves to sway - personal and cultural values, whereas pure deliberative and judicial rhetoric appeal to reason alone.\n\nAnd, Lockwood, also in \"Reader's Figure\", describes how readers are figured by their readings, and how readers figure their readings, and that readers can accept the readers' account, and forget their own account of their present and past, and that the rhetor's account is produced by language.\n\nFor centuries, epideictic oratory was a contested term, for it is clearly present in both forensic and deliberative forms, but it is difficult to clarify when it appears as a dominant discursive form. According to Chaïm Perelman and Lucy Olbrechts-Tyteca, “The speaker engaged in epidictic discourse is very close to being an educator. Since what he is going to say does not arouse controversy, since no immediate practical interest is ever involved, and there is no question of attacking or defending, but simply of promoting values that are shared in the community . . .” (52). \nSome of the defining terms for epideictic discourse include declamation, demonstration, praise or blame of the personal, and pleasing or inspiring to an audience. \n\nLawrence W. Rosenfield contends that epideictic practice surpasses mere praise and blame, and it is more than a showy display of rhetorical skill: “Epideictic’s understanding calls upon us to join with our community in giving thought to what we witness, and such thoughtful beholding in commemoration constitutes memorializing” (133). Epideictic rhetoric also calls for witnessing events, acknowledging temporality and contingency (140). However, as Rosenfield suspects, it is an uncommon form of discourse because of the rarity of “its necessary constituents — openness of mind, felt reverence for reality, enthusiasm for life, the ability to congeal significant experiences in memorable language . . .” (150).\n\nThe philologist Ernst Curtius provides an account of its history, and many examples, in \"European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages\". Praise and blame were \"reduced\" to praise by Aristotle, he wrote; and recently another author called it a \"blameless genre\". He and Lockwood seem to say that what was in the past called rhetoric was later called literature. Curtius believed that misinterpretations of medieval literature occur because so much of it is epideictic, and the epideictic is so alien to us today. During the Middle Ages it became a \"school subject\" as the sites for political activity diminished in the West, and as the centuries went on the word \"praise\" came to mean that which was written. During this period literature (more specifically histories, biographies, autobiographies, geographies) were called praise(s).\n\nBen Witherington III, writing from a biblical perspective on sacred exhortation, noted that \"in general, epideictic rhetoric is highly emotional and meant to inspire the audience to appreciate something or someone, or at the other end of the spectrum, despise something or someone. Epideictic rhetoric seeks to charm or, to cast odium.\" - I & II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary \n\nEpideictic writing in poetry is often associated with the \"fu\" rhapsody that developed in the early Han Dynasty. This highly ornamented style was used for almost any subject imaginable, and often incorporated obscure language with extensive cataloguing of rare items, all in verse of varying rhyme and line length.\n\nCommendatory verse is a genre of epideictic writing. In the Renaissance and Early Modern European tradition, it was taken to glorify both its author and the person to whom it was addressed. Prefatory verses of this kind—i.e. those printed as preface to a book—became a recognised type of advertising in the book trade.\n"}
{"id": "2426307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2426307", "title": "Flipping", "text": "Flipping\n\nFlipping is a term used primarily in the United States to describe purchasing a revenue-generating asset and quickly reselling (or \"flipping\") it for profit. Though flipping can apply to any asset, the term is most often applied to real estate and initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nThe term \"flipping\" is used by real estate investors to describe \"residential redevelopment\". Redevelopment of distressed or abandoned properties or neighborhoods has sometimes been linked to malicious and unscrupulous acts in the post housing bubble era. The term \"flipping\" is frequently used both as a descriptive term for schemes involving market manipulation and other illegal conduct and as a derogatory term for legal real estate investing strategies that are perceived by some to be unethical or socially destructive. In the United Kingdom the term is used to describe a technique whereby Members of Parliament were found to be switching their second home between several houses, which had the effect of allowing them to maximize their taxpayer funded allowances.\n\nWholesalers make a profit by signing a contract to purchase a property from a seller and then entering into an agreement with a third party to resell the same property at a higher price for a profit. All rights to the original purchase contract are assigned to the new buyer and the new buyer pays an \"assignment fee\" to the wholesaler in order to gain all rights to purchase the property at the original purchase price. The original purchase contract usually has an \"inspection period\" which allows the original buyer to back out of the contract and not close on it if they do not find a buyer to assign their contract to. Many wholesalers have no intention of actually purchasing the property and simply use wholesaling as a tool to locate properties for other investors.\n\nIn many cases, if another buyer is not found before the end of the inspection period, the wholesaler cancels the original purchase contract (through its cancellation clause) and gets back the deposit. Wholesaling requires little or no money to be secured in escrow, and in most cases the wholesaler never intends to actually purchase the property. The practice of wholesaling is often advertised as \"No Money Down and No Risk\" by many real estate coaching companies and infomercials since the actual deposit can be as little as $10 and often even the deposit can be returned if the wholesaler cancels the contract before the end of the inspection period.\n\nSome people are of the opinion that wholesaling is fraudulent misrepresentation since the wholesaler does not actually intend to close on the property themselves. However, in the United States wholesaling is perfectly legal and most real estate contracts allow the buyer an inspection period and any amount of deposit that buyer and seller agree to. Wholesaling in property is no different from wholesaling in any other industry.\n\nIn a successful transaction the seller is often unaware that original buyer is not purchasing the property. In some cases, wholesalers actually purchase the property for cash and then resell the property to their end buyer in a second closing. This practice is considered more costly since the buyer is paying closing costs to purchase the property and to resell the property. However many people consider double closing to be more ethical. In cases where there are substantial profits from reselling it often makes sense for the wholesaler to pay for two closing costs (double closing) to avoid requesting a large assignment fee from their buyer.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a property to be assigned multiple times and for a few wholesalers to make money in a transaction from the seller to the end buyer. The original wholesaler enters into a contract to purchase a property and then assigns or sells their rights to that contract to another investor. That investor then assigns their rights to said contract to a third investor and so forth. In many cases wholesalers work together ensuring that all parties get paid on a transaction. This practice is often frowned upon in the real estate community since it seems unethical or illegal. In practice there is nothing illegal about wholesaling or assigning rights to a purchase contract even if it is multiple times. It is important to understand that the reason there is an opportunity to wholesale is because the original seller is selling the property for substantially less than market value. This usually occurs when either the property or the seller is in distress. Examples of distress could be a property damaged by fire, flood, hurricane or a homeowner that is facing foreclosure and is about to lose their home and is selling it for substantially less than fair market value. The practice of buying real estate at substantially below market value is called Distressed Real Estate Investing or Wholesale Real Estate Investing hence the term \"wholesaler\".\n\nProfits from flipping real estate come from either buying low and selling high (often in a rapidly rising market), or buying a house that needs repair and fixing it up before reselling it for a profit (\"fix and flip\").\n\nUnder the \"fix and flip\" scenario, an investor or flipper will purchase a property at a discount price. The discount may be because of:\n\nThe investor will then perform necessary renovations and repairs, and attempt to make a profit by selling the house quickly at a higher price. The \"fix and flip\" scenario is profitable to investors because the average homebuyer lacks the time and funds to repairs and renovations, so they look for a property that is ready to move into. Also, most traditional mortgage lenders require the home to be habitable with no significant repairs.\n\nIn the UK, Members of Parliament with constituencies outside of London are given an allowance to maintain an extra home in London allowing them to live closer to the Houses of Parliament during the working week. Certain costs for this second home can be claimed and are thus partly funded by the taxpayer. MPs can nominate any of their other properties as the second home, which has tax advantages for not being their primary residence and can lead to additional allowances.\n\n\"Flipping\" occurs when the nominated second and primary dwellings are frequently changed, particularly during the parliamentary recess. The dwelling may in fact be rented out for profit but still receive the allowances.\n\nIn some circumstances, MPs can simultaneously declare one home to be both their primary residence (for tax purposes) and their second residence (for expenses purposes).\n\nThe practice ended on May 15, 2009 following publication of the Disclosure of expenses of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament after a public scandal.\n\nSimilar to real estate flipping, car flipping is the process of buying automobiles at a low price and selling such vehicle at a higher price. A car flipper will identify reasonably priced vehicles that can be sold at a higher price after reconditioning and marketing to a larger market.\n\nIn the United States, car flipping can be a hobby for car enthusiasts, or a primary business in the form of state licensed car dealers. Flipping cars is legal if the vehicles are titled in the person's name or processed through a state licensed dealership. Many states have laws and regulation limiting the number of vehicles a person can flip within each year unless they are a dealer or associate. This number varies from state to state, from 2 to 10. Car flipping has a larger market and requires less investment than flipping real estate.\n\nOutside of real estate and cars, all consumer products can be flipped. Product flipping entails buying products at a low price and selling it at a higher price for profit. Products can be new or used items. Many times, product flippers buy products at dollar stores, thrift stores, garage sales and estate auctions and resell them at a higher price on online marketplaces or locally. \n\nCompared to real estate flipping and car flipping, product flipping requires much lower capital to get started and thus sellers take on much less risk. Due to lower profit margins, product flippers often employ various tricks that other kinds of flippers do not have to worry about. These tricks include utilizing coupons and cash back rebates as well as finding creative ways of saving on shipping. \n\nCommon products that are flipped for profit are clothes, cell phones, books, and coins. Other less common products that are flipped are digital in nature such as Bitcoin, websites and gaming accounts. \n\nA spate of flipping often creates an economic bubble which then bursts, such as during the Florida land boom of the 1920s.\n\nIn the 2000s, relaxed federal borrowing standards (including subprime lending that allowed a borrower to purchase a home with little or no money down) may have led directly to a boom in demand for houses. Because it was easy to borrow, many investors bought homes as property speculation with no intent to live in them. Since the demand outstripped the supply, prices rose, giving a short-term profit. This resulted in an inflationary spiral until the bubble burst in 2008 and borrowing standards became stricter, leaving the housing market to bottom out.\n\nFlipping was so popular in the United States that many DIY television programs like A&E Network's \"Flip This House\" detailed the process.\n\nFlipping becomes less desirable when interest rates are high and so demand is lower. The resulting lack of sales, and major price cuts, results in a flood of properties on the market at one time, resulting in an excess of supply to demand.\n\n\"Rational\" flipping can encourage a rejuvenation and restoration of a previously decrepit neighborhood, a process known as gentrification, which increases property values but can cause a population shift.\n\nUnder the broken windows theory, an unkempt house or area attracts a criminal element, which drives out those making a responsible living, which allows for more criminal element, and so on in a spiral. Restoration creates jobs, particularly in construction, and generates more sales (and sales taxes) for local vendors and suppliers. The renovated homes attract new populations and businesses to a region, encouraging more economic development; their higher assessed values brings more property tax revenue to local governments, allowing for more improvements and more policing.\n\nWhen flipping occurs frequently in a community, the total cost of ownership can rise substantially, eventually forcing current residents to relocate, specifically poorer young and old people. On a small scale, flippers can cause distress and disturbance to their immediate neighbors by performing lengthy renovations. Flippers often have no interest in neighborhood integration, which may cause tension with long-term residents.\n\nDuring the real estate bubble of the 2000s, flipping and gentrification were both linked to the mass migration of people to California, where high real estate prices and ample jobs attracted wealth seekers. In response, many native Californians were forced to migrate to the less expensive areas of states such as Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Oregon and Washington. This migration of Californians caused further gentrification in the areas that they had moved to in large numbers. Areas such as Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas Valley became much more expensive, although property prices dropped significantly after 2006.\n\nAfter a renovation, the house itself will be in better condition and last longer, and can be sold at a higher price, thus increasing its property tax assessed value, plus increased sales for goods and services related to property improvement and the related increase in sales taxes. Neighbors can also benefit by having more attractive homes in the neighborhood, thereby increasing the value of their own homes.\n\nIn 2006, the Department of Housing and Urban Development created regulations regarding predatory flipping within Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single-family mortgage insurance. The time requirement for owning a property was greater than 90 days between purchase and sale dates to qualify for FHA-insured mortgage financing. This requirement was greatly relaxed in January 2010, and the 90-day holding period was all but eliminated.\n\nFlipping can sometimes also be a criminal scheme. Illegal property flipping is a fraud whereby recently acquired property is resold for a considerable profit with an artificially inflated value. The property is quickly resold after making few, or only cosmetic, improvements. Illegal property flipping often involves collusion between a real estate appraiser, a mortgage originator and a closing agent. The cooperation of a real estate appraiser is necessary to get a false, artificially inflated, appraisal report. The buyer may or may not be aware of the situation. This type of fraud is one of the most costly for lenders.\n\nIn the United States, the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) governs real estate appraisal and Fannie Mae, oversees the secondary residential mortgage loan market. Both have practices to detect illegal flipping schemes.\n\nIn July 2012, business network CNBC green-lit several pilots for reality television series focusing on house flipping.\n\nThe following is a list of several house flipping shows:\nAlso produced are a number of variations on \"Flipping (city name here)\" e.g. \"Flipping Vegas\", \"Flipping Boston\", \"Flipping San Diego\", or \"Flipping Miami\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49364446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49364446", "title": "Godless Painters", "text": "Godless Painters\n\n\"Godless painters\" is a term used by art historians to refer to Sebald Beham, his brother Barthel, and George Pencz, as exemplified in the title of a 2011 catalog of the Beham brothers' works, \"The Godless Painters of Nuremberg: Convention and Subversion in the Printmaking of the Beham Brothers\". The epithet was coined in derision of the three painters during an inquest conducted by the Lutheran dominated city council of Nuremberg in 1525, which concerned the artists' protestant heterodoxy. The term is a double entendre eluding more to the content of the \"godless painters\" works, rather than the doctrinal views for which they were condemned. The typically small-scale prints often depicted biblical or moral themes with a touch of eroticism. The \"godless painters\" are also considered to be leading representatives of the group of little masters.\n\nThe inquest consisted of numerous interrogations concerning matters of baptism, the Eucharist, and the role of secular authorities. Imprisonment and torture were threatened, but ultimately the three were condemned to short-term exile from the city. \n\nThe inquiries took place during the German Peasants' War, which involved theological controversies between Martin Luther and Thomas Müntzer on the matters at issues in the inquest into the beliefs of the painters. \n\nHistorical accounts regarding the painters have often been cursory, and sometimes confused due to the lack of availability of primary sources.

{"id": "1536741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1536741", "title": "Gronings dialect", "text": "Gronings dialect\n\nGronings (), in the dialect itself called Grunnegs or Grönnegs, is a collective name for some Friso-Saxon dialects spoken in the province of Groningen and around the Groningen border in Drenthe and Friesland. Gronings and the strongly related varieties in East Frisia have a strong East Frisian influence and take a remarkable position within West Low German. The dialect is characterized by a typical accent and vocabulary, which differ strongly from the other Low Saxon dialects.\n\nThe name \"Gronings\" can almost be defined geographically, as can be seen on the map below. This is especially true for the northern part of Drenthe (number 8 on that map). The \"Drents\", spoken in the north of the province of Drenthe (Noordenveld) is somewhat related with the Groninger language, but the core linguistics is \"Drents\". For the dialects in the southeast, called Veenkoloniaals, it's a bit different on both sides of the Groningen-Drenthe border, as the dialect spoken there is much more related to \"Gronings\". In the Frisian municipality of Kollumerland en Nieuwkruisland, the western dialect called Westerkwartiers is also spoken, as well as a separate Groningen dialect called Kollumerpompsters. The latter is spoken in the Frisian village of Kollumerpomp and has more West Frisian influences, while most Groningen dialects have a strong influence from the East Frisian language.\n\nThe Gronings language can be subdivided into 8 dialects:\n\n\nThough there are several differences between the dialects, they form a single dialect group. Most words are written the same way, but the pronunciation can differ. The examples show the pronunciation.\n\n\nThere are many uncertainties about the classification and categorization of Gronings. Some linguists see it as a variety of Low German, also called \"Nedersaksisch\" in the Netherlands. These words are actually more political than linguistic, because they unite a large group of very differing varieties. Categorizing Gronings as Low German could be considered correct, but there is controversy surrounding the existence of the linguistic unity of Low German.\n\nOthers, especially German linguists, see Gronings-East Frisian as a separate group of German dialects. The East Frisian influence, the sounds \"ou\", \"ai\" and \"ui\" and the typical accent are crucial here. Gronings-East Frisian would be categorized as Friso-Saxon dialects instead of Low German. Other linguists categorize all Gronings-East Frisian dialects as North Low German. In that case, all the other Low German varieties in the Netherlands are categorized as Westphalian.\n\nDutch linguists in particular classify Gronings as Dutch Low Saxon, in Germany also called \"Westplatt\". In this case the Dutch influence is crucial, while the dialects on the other side of the national border are strongly influenced by High German languages. These influences concern especially the vocabulary, like the Dutch word \"voorbeeld\" (example) which is \"veurbeeld\" in Gronings while the East Frisian dialects use \"biespööl\", which is related to the High German word \"beispiel\". In this case there is no separation between Groningen-East Frisian (or North Low Saxon) and Westphalian, but rather a difference between Groningen and East Frisian. The national border would equal the linguistic border.\n\nThe Gronings dialects are a kind of mix between two languages: Old Frisian \n(East Frisian) and Middle Low German. East Frisian was spoken in the \"Ommelanden\" (surrounding lands of the city of Groningen), while the city, the surrounding rural area called and the eastern lordship of Westerwolde were Low Saxon. When the city of Groningen developed an important position in the Ommelanden, a switch from East Frisian to Saxon occurred, although it was not a complete switch because there are many East Frisian influences in the \"new\" Groningen language. Many East Frisian words and grammatic features are still in use today. In less than one century, the same process also started in East Frisia, from the city of Emden, which was influenced by the Hanseatic League. This explains the strong relation between both varieties.\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century Gronings started to evolve towards Middle Dutch because of the strong influence of the new standard language. But because of the political, geographical and cultural isolation of Groningen, a strong provincialism in the first half of the 19th century caused Gronings to develop itself in a significant way. The sounds that are used today were formed in this period.\n\nToday, according to an investigation among the listeners to the regional broabcasting station (\"Radio Noord\"), approximately 65% of them can speak and write Gronings. Perhaps If the larger cities and villages of Groningen, Hoogezand-Sappemeer, Veendam, Stadskanaal, Delfzijl and Winschoten are excluded from this count, the percentage would rise to about 80%. Of course, this is not a representative picture of the linguistic capacity of the inhabitants of Groningen province. Most of the older people use Gronings as their main language. Until the second half of the 20th century, Gronings was more important in Groningen than Dutch. Younger people also speak the language, however in a regiolectical mixed way, because many pure Gronings words are lost. The youngest generation passed to Dutch. \nSince the second half of the 20th century, the usage of the language is declining. Because of globalization, other languages like Dutch and English are becoming more important. Parents today chose to raise their children in the Dutch language.\n\nIn the media Gronings is used frequently. For example, on the local radio station \"Radio Noord\", Gronings is used by the presenters and listeners. On local television Gronings is used less, but the weather forecast is always presented in Gronings. The news is always presented in Dutch, since not all viewers understand Gronings. In the second half of 2007, the local television broadcast a series in Gronings called . Another program that is in and about Gronings is \"Grunnegers\", which is actually some kind of education in Gronings.\n\nExamples of Gronings magazines are (language and signs) and , which actually means cannabis.\n\nThere are many Gronings dictionaries as well. The first official dictionary was the \"Nieuw Groninger Woordenboek\" and was put together by Kornelis ter Laan. This dictionary and the writing system used in the book became the basics of each dictionary and writing system ever since.\n\nMore recent is \"Zakwoordenboek Gronings - Nederlands / Nederlands - Gronings\" by , which is a little less specific. K. G. Pieterman wrote a dictionary of Gronings alliterations which is titled \"Gezondhaid en Groutnis\" (sanity and greetings).\n\nAlthough Gronings, as part of Low Saxon, is an official language, it is not a mandatory subject in schools. Still, many primary schools in Groningen choose to give attention to the regional language. This attention varies from inviting storytellers to teaching about the language. In secondary schools Gronings does not receive much attention.\n\nAt the University of Groningen it is possible to study the language. In October 2007 Gronings became an official study within the faculty of \"letteren\" (language and literature). The new professor, Siemon Reker, had already undergone many studies in the language and is famous for his dictionary.\n\nAnother possible way to learn Gronings is taking classes. In the last few years the trend of people taking courses has risen. More and more people, also people from outside who come to live in the area in which Gronings is spoken, are interested in the language and are willing to take courses. There are two types of courses. The first one is understanding and the second one is understanding and speaking.\n\nEvery year around March Het Huis van de Groninger Cultuur (English: House of the Groningen Culture) organises a writing contest in every municipality in Groningen. Everyone can participate and send in a poem or some prose. The winners of the different ages succeed to the provincial round.\n\nWell known Groningen musical artists are Wia Buze, Alje van Bolhuis, Alex Vissering, Eltje Doddema, Pé Daalemmer & Rooie Rinus, Burdy, Hail Gewoon and Ede Staal (†). Every year the supply of successful artists in regional languages in the Netherlands is rising.\n\nSome linguists classify Gronings to North Low Saxon, to which also East Frisian belongs. Both related dialects are characterized by an East Frisian influence. Hence other linguists classify Gronings-East Frisian as a separate group of Northwest Low Saxon or Friso-Saxon dialects. The most important similarities are grammar features and the vocabulary. The most important differences are the writing system and the loanwords. The East Frisian writing system is based on High German while Gronings uses many Dutch features. For example, the word for “ice skate” is in Gronings “scheuvel” and in East Frisian “Schöfel”, while the pronunciation is almost alike. Here are a few examples of words compared to West Frisian, East Frisian Low Saxon, German, Dutch and English.\n\nThe East Frisian combination -oo (for example in \"Bloot\" = blood) is pronounced like -ow in the English word “now”(\"[blowt]\"; Gronings: \"blowd\"). In some parts of the Rheiderland they say \"blyowt\", which is a leftover of Frisian in this area. The East Frisian combination -aa (for example in \"quaad\") is pronounced like –a in the British English word “water”. In Gronings this sound is written like –oa. The word water would be written like “woatah” in Gronings. The pronunciation of the word “quaad” is similar to the Gronings word “kwoad”, which means “angry”. The East Frisian combination -ee and -eei (for example in \"neet\") are pronounced like the –y in the English word “fly” (\"[nyt]\"; Gronings: \"nyt\")*.\n\nAfter Limburgish, Gronings is the dialect with the farthest distance from Standard Dutch. Reasons for this are vocabulary and pronunciation. The Gronings vocabulary is quite different from Dutch, for example:\n\nThe pronunciation differs from the writing system. The -en ending of many words is pronounced like (ə or ən) in most varieties of Dutch. In Gronings and many other Low Saxon dialects these words are pronounced with a glottal stop, thus making the words ending in , or .\nThe Groningen people speak quite fast compared to the Dutch people, with the result that a lot of words are pronounced together as one word.\n\nGronings is also a dialect with many unique expressions. One third of the language consists of these expressions. In the example sentence \"n hail ìnde\" is an example of those expressions. Many of these are given in the 'Nieuwe Groninger Woordenboek' by K. ter Laan published in 1977, (1280pp).\n\nBecause of this far distance from Standard Dutch and the official status of the neighbouring West Frisian, Grunnegs is considered as a separate language by some of its native speakers, while linguists consider it part of Dutch Low Saxon.\n\nLord’s Prayer\n\nThe Gronings vocabulary is strongly related to East Frisian Low Saxon, Saterfrisian and West Frisian. However, today the pure Gronings vocabulary is in decline. More and more Gronings words are being replaced by “Groningized” Dutch words. For example, the word “stevel” (boot, German “Stiefel”) is sometimes replaced by the word “leers” (Dutch “laars”). Although most people do know the pure words, they are less and less used, for example because people think others will not understand them or because they are too long and the Dutch word is much easier. An example of the latter is the word for sock, which is “Hozevörrel” in Gronings. The Dutch word “sok” is much easier, so it is more often used than hozevörrel.\n\nSome often used Gronings words are listed below;\n\n"}
{"id": "503857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=503857", "title": "Hawaiian Pidgin", "text": "Hawaiian Pidgin\n\nHawaiian Pidgin English (alternately Hawaiian Creole English or HCE, known locally as Pidgin) is an English-based creole language spoken in Hawaiʻi (L1: 600,000; L2: 400,000). Although English and Hawaiian are the co-official languages of the state of Hawaiʻi, Hawaiian Pidgin is spoken by many Hawaiʻi residents in everyday conversation and is often used in advertising targeted toward locals in Hawaiʻi. In the Hawaiian language, Hawaiian Creole English is called \"ōlelo pai ai\", which literally means \"pounding-taro language\".\n\nDespite its name, Hawaiian Pidgin is not a pidgin, but rather a full-fledged, nativized, and demographically stable creole language. It did, however, evolve from various real pidgins spoken as common languages between ethnic groups in Hawaiʻi. \n\nAlthough it is not completely mutually intelligible with Standard American English, Hawaiian Pidgin retains the highest degree of mutual intelligibility with it when compared with other English-based creoles, such as Jamaican Patois, in part due to its relatively recent emergence.\n\nHawaiian Pidgin originated on sugarcane plantations as a form of communication used between English speaking residents and non-English speaking Native Hawaiians and foreign immigrants. It supplanted, and was influenced by, the existing pidgin that Native Hawaiians already used on plantations and elsewhere in Hawaiʻi. Because such sugarcane plantations often hired workers from many different countries, a common language was needed in order for the plantation workers to communicate effectively with each other and their supervisors. Hawaiian Pidgin has been influenced by many different languages, including Portuguese, Hawaiian, American English, and Cantonese. As people of other language backgrounds were brought in to work on the plantations, such as Japanese, Filipinos, and Koreans, Hawaiian Pidgin acquired words from these languages. Japanese loanwords in Hawaiʻi lists some of those words originally from Japanese. It has also been influenced to a lesser degree by Spanish spoken by Puerto Rican settlers in Hawaiʻi. Hawaiian Pidgin also takes loanwords from the Hawaiian Language. Hawaiian Pidgin was created mainly as a means of communication or to facilitate cooperation between the immigrants and the Americans to get business done. Even today, Hawaiian Pidgin retains some influences from these languages. For example, the word \"stay\" in Hawaiian Pidgin has a form and use similar to the Hawaiian verb \"noho\", Portuguese verb \"ficar\" or Spanish \"estar\", which mean \"to be\" but are used only when referring to a temporary state or location.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Hawaiian Pidgin started to be used outside the plantation between ethnic groups. In the 1980's two educational programs started that were lead in Hawaiian Pidgin to help students learn Standard English. Public school children learned Hawaiian Pidgin from their classmates and parents. Living in a community mixed with various cultures led to the daily usage of Hawaiian Pidgin, also causing the language to expand. It was easier for school children of different ethnic backgrounds to speak Hawaiian Pidgin then to learn another language. Children growing up with this language expanded Hawaiian Pidgin as their first language, or mother tongue. For this reason, linguists generally consider Hawaiian Pidgin to be a creole language. A five-year survey that the U.S. Census Bureau conducted in Hawaiʻi and released in November 2015 revealed that many people spoke Pidgin as an additional language. Because of this, in 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau added Pidgin to its list of official languages in the state of Hawaiʻi.\n\nHawaiian Pidgin has distinct pronunciation differences from standard American English (SAE). Long vowels are not pronounced in Hawaiian Pidgin if the speaker is using Hawaiian loanwords. Some key differences include the following:\n\n\nHawaiian Pidgin also has distinct grammatical forms not found in SAE, but some of which are shared with other dialectal forms of English or may derive from other linguistic influences.\n\nForms used for SAE \"to be\":\n\nNote that these constructions also mimic the grammar of the Hawaiian language. In Hawaiian, \"nani ka pēpē\" or \"kiuke ka pēpē\" is literally \"cute the baby\" and is perfectly correct Hawaiian grammar meaning in English, \"The baby is cute.\"\n\n\nFor tense-marking of verb, auxiliary verbs are employed:\n\n\n\nThe language is highly stigmatized in formal settings, for which American English or Hawaiian are preferred, and therefore reserved for everyday casual conversations. Studies have proved that children in kindergarten preferred Hawaiian Pidgin, but once they were in grade one and more socially conditioned they preferred Standard English. Hawaiian Pidgin is often criticized in business, educational, family, social, and community situations and Hawaiian Pidgin is construed as rude, crude or broken English among some Standard English speakers. Many tourists find Hawaiian Pidgin appealing. Local travel companies favor those who speak Hawaiian Pidgin and hire them as speakers or customer service agents.\n\nIn recent years, writers from Hawaiʻi such as Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Joe Balaz and Lee Tonouchi have written poems, short stories, and other works in Hawaiian Pidgin. A Hawaiian Pidgin translation of the New Testament (called \"Da Jesus Book\") has also been created, as has an adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night, or What You Will\", titled in Hawaiian Pidgin \"twelf nite o' WATEVA!\"\n\nSeveral theater companies in Hawaii produce plays written and performed in Hawaiian Pidgin. The most notable of these companies is Kumu Kahua Theater.\n\nHawaiian Pidgin has occasionally been featured on \"Hawaii Five-0\" as the protagonists frequently interact with locals. The show heavily features Hawaiian culture and is filmed on location.\n\nMilton Murayama's novel \"All I asking for is my body\" uses Hawaiʻi Pidgin in the title of the novel.\n\nTwo books, Pidgin to Da Max humorously portray pidgin through prose and illustrations.\n\nAs of March 2008, Hawaiian Pidgin has started to become more popular in local television advertisements as well as other media. When Hawaiin Pidgin is used in advertisements, it is often changed to better fit the targeted audience of the \"kama‘aina.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41105510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41105510", "title": "Hybrid machine translation", "text": "Hybrid machine translation\n\nHybrid machine translation is a method of machine translation that is characterized by the use of multiple machine translation approaches within a single machine translation system. The motivation for developing hybrid machine translation systems stems from the failure of any single technique to achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy. Many hybrid machine translation systems have been successful in improving the accuracy of the translations, and there are several popular machine translation systems which employ hybrid methods. Among these are PROMT, SYSTRAN and Omniscien Technologies (formerly Asia Online).\n\nThis approach to hybrid machine translation involves running multiple machine translation systems in parallel. The final output is generated by combining the output of all the sub-systems. Most commonly, these systems use statistical and rule-based translation subsystems, but other combinations have been explored. For example, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have had some success combining example-based, transfer-based, knowledge-based and statistical translation sub-systems into one machine translation system.\n\nThis approach involves using statistical data to generate lexical and syntactic rules.The input is then processed with these rules as if it were a rule-based translator. This approach attempts to avoid the difficult and time-consuming task of creating a set of comprehensive, fine-grained linguistic rules by extracting those rules from the training corpus. This approach still suffers from many problems of normal statistical machine translation, namely that the accuracy of the translation will depend heavily on the similarity of the input text to the text of the training corpus. As a result, this technique has had the most success in domain-specific applications, and has the same difficulties with domain adaptation as many statistical machine translation systems.\n\nThis approach involves serially processing the input multiple times. The most common technique used in multi-pass machine translation systems is to pre-process the input with a rule-based machine translation system. The output of the rule-based pre-processor is passed to a statistical machine translation system, which produces the final output. This technique is used to limit the amount of information a statistical system need consider, significantly reducing the processing power required. It also removes the need for the rule-based system to be a complete translation system for the language, significantly reducing the amount of human effort and labor necessary to build the system. \n\n"}

It is well known for its rich epigraphic record with about 2000 known inscriptions conditioned by the high-quality marble from the area. This richness invited a publication format different from the conventional, and the choice of online publication using EpiDoc was chosen for the possibility to incorporate diverse archaeological information as well as good accessibility.\n\nInitially intended to create a corpus of the inscriptions of Aphrodisias and to further develop the EpiDoc guidelines, the Inscriptions of Aphrodisias Project also proved to foster the networks and collaboration between scholars in the field.

His mother, Lukrezia, was the daughter of another Protestant pastor, Heinrich Becker from Rostock.\n\nHe had an elder brother, Hermann Daniel Hermes (1734–1807), who would attain a certain level of notability as a theologian.\n\nHe studied Theology at Königsberg and then became a teacher at the at Brandenburg an der Havel. There followed a succession of ecclesistical posts, as he became a military chaplain, a court chaplain in Anhalt and then a pastor in Pleß. In 1771 Hermes became a professor of Theology at the Maria Magdalena Gymnasium (high school) in Breslau, and four years later appointed a Provost in Breslau's new town district. Subsequently he became a pastor at the cathedral church. In 1808 he became Administrative Superintendent with responsibility for the churches and schools in the Breslau Princedom.\n\nHermes has become known, above all, for his novels \"Geschichte der Miss Fanny Wilkes\" (\"The Story of Miss Fanny Wilkes\" 1766) and \"Sophiens Reise von Memel nach Sachsen\" (\"Sophie's Journey from Memel to Saxony\" 1769-1773 in five volumes) which were very successful at the time, and translated into several languages. The second of these became one of the most read novel in German during the eighteenth century. The author gained the popular soubriquet \"Sophien-Hermes\" from it: its continuing importance two centuries later is based on its real-life descriptions concerning the cultural history of its time. The book also adumbrates aspects of the psychological novels which would flourish in the nineteenth century. \"Sophie's Journey\" is nevertheless characteristic of its own epoch. It is one of the most important Empathy novels: Hermes consciously imported the style of his exemplar Samuel Richardson, whose own novels had been translated into German a few years earlier.\n\nAlthough Hermes wrote several more novels, he never came close to repeating the commercial success of his first two. In 1779 he published in a stand-alone volume the poems from \"Sophie's Journey\", presented as songs and arias, with music by Johann Adam Hiller. Other composers who set poems by Johann Timotheus Hermes to music were Maria Theresia von Paradis, Joseph Martin Kraus, Franz Anton Hoffmeister and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nDespite his success or because of it, Hermes was the butt of much ridicule from the \"literary greats\" among his contemporaries. He was ridiculed in Xenien, a collection of Couplets published jointly by Goethe and Schiller.\n"}

Along with other regional languages mentioned in the \"Sixth Schedule\", as well as Hindi and Urdu, the Kashmiri language is to be developed in the state. Most Kashmiri speakers use Urdu or English as a second language. Since November 2008, the Kashmiri language has been made a compulsory subject in all government schools in the Valley up to secondary level.\n\nIn 1919 George Abraham Grierson wrote that “Kashmiri is the only one of the Dardic languages that has a literature”. Kashmiri literature dates back to over 750 years, this is, more-or-less, the age of many a modern literature including modern English.\n\nKashmiri is a fusional language with verb-second (V2) word order. Several of Kashmiri’s grammatical features distinguish it from other Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nKashmiri nouns are inflected according to gender, number and case. There are no articles, nor is there any grammatical distinction for definiteness, although there is some optional adverbial marking for indefinite or “generic” noun qualities.\n\nThe Kashmiri gender system is divided into masculine and feminine. Feminine forms are typically generated by the addition of a suffix (or in most cases, a morphophonemic change, or both) to a masculine noun. There is also a relatively small group of feminine nouns that have unique suppletion forms which are totally different from the corresponding masculine forms. The following table illustrates the range of possible gender forms: \n\nSome nouns borrowed from other languages, such as Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, Hindi or English, follow a slightly different gender system. Notably, many words borrowed from Hindi have different genders in Kashmiri.\n\nThere are five cases in Kashmiri: nominative, dative, ergative, ablative and vocative. Case is expressed via suffixation of the noun. \n\nKashmiri utilizes an ergative-absolutive case structure when the verb is in simple past tense. Thus, in these sentences, the subject of a transitive verb is marked in the ergative case and the object in nominative, which is identical to how the subject of an intransitive verb would be marked. However, in sentences constructed in any other tense, or in past tense sentences with intransitive verbs, a nominative-dative paradigm is adopted, with objects (whether direct or indirect) generally marked in dative case.\n\nOther case distinctions, such as locative, instrumental, genitive, comitative and allative, are marked by postpositions rather than suffixation.\n\nThe following table illustrates Kashmiri noun declension according to gender, number and case.\n\nKashmiri verbs are declined according to tense and person, and to a lesser extent, gender. Tense, along with certain distinctions of aspect, is formed by the addition of suffixes to the verb stem (minus the infinitive ending -un), and in many cases by the addition of various modal auxiliaries. Postpositions fulfill numerous adverbial and semantic roles.\n\nPresent tense in Kashmiri is an auxiliary construction formed by a combination of the copula and the imperfective suffix -ān added to the verb stem. The various copula forms agree with their subject according to gender and number, and are provided below with the verb \"yun\" (to come): \n\nPast tense in Kashmiri is significantly more complex than the other tenses, and is subdivided into three past tense distinctions. The simple (sometimes called proximate) past refers to past actions which have been completed. Remote past refers to actions that lack this in-built perfective aspect. Indefinite past refers to actions performed a long time ago, and is often used in historical narrative or storytelling contexts. \n\nAs described above, Kashmiri is a split-ergative language; in all three of these past tense forms, the subjects of transitive verbs are marked in the ergative case and direct objects in the nominative. Intransitive subjects are marked in the nominative. Nominative arguments, whether subjects or objects, dictate gender, number and person marking on the verb.\n\nVerbs of the simple past tense are formed via the addition of a suffix to the verb stem, which usually undergoes certain uniform morphophonemic changes. First and third person verbs of this type do not take suffixes and agree with the nominative object in gender and number, but there are second person verb endings. The entire simple past tense paradigm of transitive verbs is illustrated below using the verb \"parun\" (\"to read\"): \n\nThere is a group of \"special intransitives\", irregular intransitive verbs which take a different set of endings in addition to the morphophonemic changes that affect most past tense verbs.\n\nIntransitive verbs in the simple past are conjugated the same as intransitives in the indefinite past tense form.\n\nIn contrast to the simple past, verb stems are unchanged in the indefinite and remote past, although the addition of the tense suffixes does cause some morphophonetic change. Transitive verbs are declined according to the following paradigm: \n\nAs in the simple past, \"special intransitive\" verbs take a different set of endings in the indefinite and remote past:\n\nRegular intransitive verbs also take a different set of endings in the indefinite and remote past, subject to some morphophonetic variation:\n\nFuture tense intransitive verbs are formed by the addition of suffixes to the verb stem:\n\nThe future tense of transitive verbs, however, is formed by the addition of suffixes which agree with both the subject and direct object according to number, in a complex fashion:\n\nThere are two main aspectual distinctions in Kashmiri, perfective and imperfective. Both employ a participle formed by the addition of a suffix to the verb stem, as well as the fully conjugated auxiliary \"āsun\" (“to be”) which agrees according to gender, number and person with the object (for transitive verbs) or the subject (for intransitive verbs).\n\nLike the auxiliary, the participle suffix used with the perfective aspect (expressing completed or concluded action) agrees in gender and number with the object (for transitive verbs) or subject (for intransitives) as illustrated below:\n\nThe imperfective (expressing habitual or progressive action) is simpler, taking the participle suffix -ān in all forms, with only the auxiliary showing agreement. A type of iterative aspect can be expressed by reduplicating the imperfective participle.\nPronouns are declined according to person, gender, number and case, although only third person pronouns are overtly gendered. Also in third person, a distinction is made between three degrees of proximity, called proximate, remote I and remote II.\n\nThere is also a dedicated genitive pronoun set, in contrast to the way that the genitive is constructed adverbially elsewhere. As with future tense, these forms agree with both the subject and direct object in person and number.\n\nThere are two kinds of adjectives in Kashmiri, those which agree with their referent noun (according to case, gender and number) and those which are not declined at all. Most adjectives are declined, and generally take the same endings and gender-specific stem changes as nouns. The declinable adjective endings are provided in the table below, using the adjective \"wozul\" (“red”):\n\nAmong those adjectives which are not declined are adjectives ending in -lad or -a, adjectives borrowed from other languages, and a few isolated irregulars.\n\nThe comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are formed with the words \"tsor\" (“more”) and \"sitha\" (“most”), respectively.\n\nThere are minor differences between the Kashmiri spoken by Hindus and Muslims. For 'fire', a traditional Hindu will use the word \"agun\" while a Muslim more often will use the Arabic word \"nar\".\n\nKashmiri retains several features of Old Indo-Aryan that have been lost in other modern Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi. Some vocabulary features that Kashmiri preserves clearly date from the Vedic Sanskrit era and had already been lost even in Classical Sanskrit. This includes the word-form \"yodvai\" (meaning \"if\"), which is mainly found in Vedic Sanskrit texts. Classical Sanskrit and modern Indo-Aryan use instead the word \"yadi\".\n\nBoth the Indo-Aryan and Iranian branches of the Indo-Iranian family have demonstrated a strong tendency to eliminate the distinctive first person pronoun (\"I\") used in the nominative (subject) case. The Indo-European root for this is reconstructed as *eǵHom, which is preserved in Sanskrit as \"aham\" and in Avestan Persian as \"azam\". This contrasts with the \"m-\" form (\"me\", \"my\") that is used for the accusative, genitive, dative, ablative cases. Sanskrit and Avestan both used forms such as \"ma(-m)\". However, in languages such as Modern Persian, Baluchi, Hindi and Punjabi, the distinct nominative form has been entirely lost and replaced with \"m-\" in words such as \"ma-n\" and \"mai\". However, Kashmiri belongs to a relatively small set that preserves the distinction. 'I' is \"ba/bi/bo\" in various Kashmiri dialects, distinct from the other \"me\" terms. 'Mine' is \"myoon\" in Kashmiri. Other Indo-Aryan languages that preserve this feature include Dogri (\"aun\" vs \"me-\"), Gujarati (\"hu-n\" vs \"ma-ri\"), Konkani (\"hā̃v\" vs \"mhazo\"), and Braj (\"hau-M\" vs \"mai-M\"). The Iranian Pashto preserves it too (\"za\" vs. \"maa\").\n\nKashmiri has the following vowel phonemes:\n\nKashmiri, as also the other Dardic languages, shows important divergences from the Indo-Aryan mainstream. One is the partial maintenance of the three sibilant consonants \"s ṣ ś\" of the Old Indo-Aryan period. For another example, the prefixing form of the number 'two', which is found in Sanskrit as \"dvi-\", has developed into \"ba-/bi-\" in most other Indo-Aryan languages, but \"du-\" in Kashmiri (preserving the original dental stop \"d\"). \"Seventy-two\" is \"dusatath\" in Kashmiri, \"bahattar\" in Hindi-Urdu and Punjabi, and \"dvisaptati\" in Sanskrit.\n\nCertain features in Kashmiri even appear to stem from Indo-Aryan even predating the Vedic period. For instance, there was an /s/ > /h/ consonant shift in some words that had already occurred with Vedic Sanskrit (this tendency is even stronger in the Iranian branch of Indo-Iranian), yet is lacking in Kashmiri equivalents. The word \"rahit\" in Vedic Sanskrit and modern Hindi-Urdu (meaning 'excluding' or 'without') corresponds to \"rost\" in Kashmiri. Similarly, \"sahit\" (meaning 'including' or 'with') corresponds to \"sost\" in Kashmiri.\n\nThere are three orthographical systems used to write the Kashmiri language: the Sharada script, the Devanagari script and the Perso-Arabic script. The Roman script is also sometimes informally used to write Kashmiri, especially online.\n\nThe Kashmiri language is traditionally written in the Sharada script after the 8th Century A.D. This script however, is not in common use today, except for religious ceremonies of the Kashmiri Pandits.\n\nToday it is written in Perso-Arabic and Devanagari scripts (with some modifications). Among languages written in the Perso-Arabic script, Kashmiri is one of the very few which regularly indicates all vowel sounds. The Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script has come to be associated with Kashmiri Muslims, while the Kashmiri Devanagari script has come to be associated with the Kashmiri Hindu community.\n\nThe digraphs of Aspirated consonant are as follow.\nThere have been two Unicode proposals (L2/09-369 and L2/08-250) for Devanagari Kashmiri vowels with different vowel characters, ordering and vowel mark characters. The latest proposal (L2/09-369) is tabulated below.\n\nThe earlier proposal (L2/08-250) is tabulated below.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "230342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230342", "title": "Keystone species", "text": "Keystone species\n\nA keystone species is a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance. Such species are described as playing a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological community, affecting many other organisms in an ecosystem and helping to determine the types and numbers of various other species in the community. A keystone species is a plant or animal that plays a unique and crucial role in the way an ecosystem functions. Without keystone species, the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether. Some keystone species, such as the wolf, are also apex predators.\n\nThe role that a keystone species plays in its ecosystem is analogous to the role of a keystone in an arch. While the keystone is under the least pressure of any of the stones in an arch, the arch still collapses without it. Similarly, an ecosystem may experience a dramatic shift if a keystone species is removed, even though that species was a small part of the ecosystem by measures of biomass or productivity.\nIt became a popular concept in conservation biology, alongside flagship and umbrella species. Although the concept is valued as a descriptor for particularly strong inter-species interactions, and it has allowed easier communication between ecologists and conservation policy-makers, it has been criticized for oversimplifying complex ecological systems.\n\nThe concept of the keystone species was introduced in 1969 by the zoologist Robert T. Paine. Paine developed the concept to explain his observations and experiments on the relationships between marine invertebrates of the intertidal zone (between the high and low tide lines), including starfish and mussels. He removed the starfish from an area, and documented the effects on the ecosystem. In his 1966 paper, \"Food Web Complexity and Species Diversity\", Paine had described such a system in Makah Bay in Washington.\nIn his 1969 paper, Paine proposed the keystone species concept, using \"Pisaster ochraceus\", a species of starfish, and \"Mytilus californianus\", a species of mussel, as a primary example. The concept became popular in conservation, and was deployed in a range of contexts and mobilized to engender support for conservation, especially where human activities had damaged ecosystems, such as by removing keystone predators.\n\nA keystone species was defined by Paine as a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance. It has been defined operationally by R. D. Davic in 2003 as \"a strongly interacting species whose top-down effect on species diversity and competition is large relative to its biomass dominance within a functional group.\"\n\nA classic keystone species is a predator that prevents a particular herbivorous species from eliminating dominant plant species. If prey numbers are low, keystone predators can be even less abundant and still be effective. Yet without the predators, the herbivorous prey would explode in numbers, wipe out the dominant plants, and dramatically alter the character of the ecosystem. The exact scenario changes in each example, but the central idea remains that through a chain of interactions, a non-abundant species has an outsized impact on ecosystem functions. For example, the herbivorous weevil \"Euhrychiopsis lecontei\" is thought to have keystone effects on aquatic plant diversity by foraging on nuisance Eurasian watermilfoil in North American waters. Similarly, the wasp species \"Agelaia vicina\" has been labeled a keystone species for its unparalleled nest size, colony size, and high rate of brood production. The diversity of its prey and the quantity necessary to sustain its high rate of growth have a direct impact on other species around it.\n\nThe keystone concept is defined by its ecological effects, and these in turn make it important for conservation. In this it overlaps with several other species conservation concepts such as flagship species, indicator species, and umbrella species. For example, the jaguar is a charismatic big cat which meets all of these definitions:\n\nSea otters protect kelp forests from damage by sea urchins. When the sea otters of the North American west coast were hunted commercially for their fur, their numbers fell to such low levels – fewer than 1000 in the north Pacific ocean – that they were unable to control the sea urchin population. The urchins in turn grazed the holdfasts of kelp so heavily that the kelp forests largely disappeared, along with all the species that depended on them. Reintroducing the sea otters has enabled the kelp ecosystem to be restored. For example, in Southeast Alaska some 400 sea otters were released, and they have bred to form a population approaching 25,000.\n\nKeystone predators may increase the biodiversity of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant. They can have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem. Introduction or removal of this predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem. For example, grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over.\n\nThe elimination of the gray wolf from Yellowstone National Park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid. Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because the beavers helped slow the water down, allowing soil to stay in place. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order. When wolves were reintroduced, the beaver population and the whole riparian ecosystem recovered dramatically within a few years.\n\nAs described by Paine in 1966, some sea stars (e.g., \"Pisaster ochraceus\") may prey on sea urchins, mussels, and other shellfish that have no other natural predators. If the sea star is removed from the ecosystem, the mussel population explodes uncontrollably, driving out most other species.\n\nThese creatures need not be apex predators. Sea stars are prey for sharks, rays, and sea anemones. Sea otters are prey for orca.\n\nThe jaguar, whose numbers in Central and South America have been classified as near threatened, acts as a keystone predator by its widely varied diet, helping to balance the mammalian jungle ecosystem with its consumption of 87 different species of prey. The lion is another keystone species.\n\nKeystone mutualists are organisms that participate in mutually beneficial interactions, the loss of which would have a profound impact upon the ecosystem as a whole. For example, in the Avon Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, there is a period of each year when \"Banksia prionotes\" (acorn banksia) is the sole source of nectar for honeyeaters, which play an important role in pollination of numerous plant species. Therefore, the loss of this one species of tree would probably cause the honeyeater population to collapse, with profound implications for the entire ecosystem. Another example is frugivores such as the cassowary, which spreads the seeds of many different trees, and some will not grow unless they have been through a cassowary.\n\nA term used alongside keystone is ecosystem engineer. In North America, the prairie dog is an ecosystem engineer. Prairie dog burrows provide the nesting areas for mountain plovers and burrowing owls. Prairie dog tunnel systems also help channel rainwater into the water table to prevent runoff and erosion, and can also serve to change the composition of the soil in a region by increasing aeration and reversing soil compaction that can be a result of cattle grazing. Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies, perhaps to remove any cover for predators. Grazing species such as plains bison, pronghorn, and mule deer have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.\n\nThe beaver is a well known ecosystem engineer and keystone species. It transforms its territory from a stream to a pond or swamp. Beavers affect the environment first altering the edges of riparian areas by cutting down older trees to use for their dams. This allows younger trees to take their place. Beaver dams alter the riparian area they are established in. Depending on topography, soils, and many factors, these dams change the riparian edges of streams and rivers into wetlands, meadows, or riverine forests. These dams have been shown to be beneficial to a myriad of species including amphibians, salmon, and song birds.\n\nIn the African savanna, the larger herbivores, especially the elephants, shape their environment. The elephants destroy trees, making room for the grass species. Without these animals, much of the savanna would turn into woodland.\n\nAustralian studies have found that parrotfish on the Great Barrier Reef are the only reef fish that consistently scrape and clean the coral on the reef. Without these animals, the Great Barrier Reef would be under severe strain.\n\nAlthough the concept of the keystone species has a value in describing particularly strong inter-species interactions, and for allowing easier communication between ecologists and conservation policy-makers, it has been criticized by L. S. Mills and colleagues for oversimplifying complex ecological systems. The term has been applied widely in different ecosystems and to predators, prey, and plants (primary producers), inevitably with differing ecological meanings. For instance, removing a predator may allow other animals to increase to the point where they wipe out other species; removing a prey species may cause predator populations to crash, or may allow predators to drive other prey species to extinction; and removing a plant species may result in the loss of animals that depend on it, like pollinators and seed dispersers. Beavers too have been called keystone, not for eating other species but for modifying the environment in ways that affected other species. The term has thus been given quite different meanings in different cases. In Mills's view, Paine's work showed that a few species could sometimes have extremely strong interactions within a particular ecosystem, but that does not automatically imply that other ecosystems have a similar structure.\n\n"}

{"id": "1042259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1042259", "title": "Landline", "text": "Landline\n\nA landline telephone (also known as land line, land-line, main line, home phone, landline, fixed-line, and wireline) is a phone that uses a metal wire or optical fiber telephone line for transmission as distinguished from a mobile cellular line, which uses radio waves for transmission.\nIn 2003, the CIA World Factbook reported approximately 1.263 billion main telephone lines worldwide. China had more than any other country at 350 million and the United States was second with 268 million. The United Kingdom had 23.7 million residential fixed home phones.\n\nThe 2013 statistics show that the total number of fixed-telephone subscribers in the world was about 1.16 billion. The number of landline subscribers continuously decreases due to upgrades in digital technology and the conveniences that come with switching to wireless (cellular) or Internet-based alternatives.\n\nA fixed phone line (a line that is not a mobile phone line) can be hard-wired or cordless and typically refers to the operation of wireless devices or systems in fixed locations such as homes. Fixed wireless devices usually derive their electrical power from the utility mains electricity, unlike mobile wireless or portable wireless, which tend to be battery-powered. Although mobile and portable systems can be used in fixed locations, efficiency and bandwidth are compromised compared with fixed systems. Mobile or portable, battery-powered wireless systems can be used as emergency backups for fixed systems in case of a power blackout or natural disaster.\n\nThe term landline is also used to describe a connection between two or more points that consists of a dedicated physical cable, as opposed to an always-available private link that is actually implemented as a circuit in a wired switched system (usually the public switched telephone network). So-called leased lines are invariably of the latter type; the implications of a land line in this context are security and survivability. For example, a military headquarters might be linked to front-line units \"by landline\" to ensure that communication remains possible even if the conventional telephone network is damaged or destroyed. Another example of this is in airports. All air traffic control towers have dedicated lines connected to the police, fire department, hospitals, army, etc. Deployed as a precaution in case of emergency, these can be used at any time.\n\nIn many countries the landline has not been readily available to most people. In some countries in Africa, the rise in cell phones has outpaced any rise in landline telephones. Between 1998 and 2008, Africa added only 2.4 million landlines. During this same time the number of mobile phone lines that have been subscribed to has skyrocketed. Between 2000 and 2008, cell phone use has risen from fewer than 2 in 100 people to 33 out of 100. It is more difficult to install landline copper wires to every user, than it is to install mobile wireless towers that people can connect to from anywhere. There has also been substantial decline of landline phones in Indian subcontinent, in urban and even more in rural areas. \n\nIn the early 21st century, the landline telephone has declined due to the advancement of mobile network technology and the obsolescence of the old copper wire networking. Eventually these metallic networks will be deemed completely out of date and replaced by more efficient broadband and fiber optic landline connections extending to rural areas and places where telecommunication was much more sparse. Some see this happening as soon as the year 2025.\n\nIn 2004, only about 45% of people in the United States between the ages of 12 and 17 owned cell phones. At that time, they had to rely on landline telephones. In just 4 years' time, that percentage climbed to about 71%. That same year, 2008, about 77% of adults owned a mobile phone. In the year 2013, 91% of adults in the United States owned a mobile phone. Almost 60% of those with a mobile had a smartphone. A National Health Interview Survey of 19,956 households by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released May 4, 2017 showed only 45.9 percent of U.S. households still had landlines, while 50.8 percent had only cell phones. Over 39 percent had both.\n\nIn Canada, more than one in five of households use cell phones as their only source for telephone service. In 2013, statistics showed that 21% of households claimed to only use cellular phones. Households that are owned by members under the age of 35 have a considerably higher percentage of exclusive cell phone use. In 2013, 60% of young household owners claimed to only use cell phones. \n\nMany of the consumer protections which regulators apply to incumbent landline providers, such as restrictions against cutting off subscribers without notice, do not apply to competing communication services such as cable modems and voice over IP.\n\n"}

Some scholars classify the Lugbara language itself as a dialect of the Ma'di language, though this is not generally accepted.

The language has diphthong clusters and other noteworthy phonetics including the following:\n\naa as in \"bat\", for example embataa\n\nc as in \"church\", for example Candiru (which is also spelt Chandiru)\n\ndj as in \"jilt\", for example odji, the ‘d’ is silent\n\nee as in \"emblem\", for example Andree\n\ngb as in \"bend\", for example gbe, the ‘g’ is silent. Gb in Lugbara does not have an equivalent in English.What stands out in these Sudanic languages is the special manner in which 'kp, gb, 'd, 'b, 'y, 'w are pronounced.\n\ni as in \"inn\", for example di-i\n\noa as in \"oar\", for example Adroa\n\noo as in \"old\", for example ocoo, less often oo as in food, for example ‘doo\n\nuu as in \"chew\", for example cuu\n\nz as in \"jean\" after n, for example onzi. Otherwise, most times remains z as in \"zebra\", for example Ozu and when the first letter of a word.\n\nThe Lugbara alphabet has 28 letters minus ‘q’ and ‘x’ (Alamakanda in Aringa language), which means 24 like in English and four unique ones namely: ‘b like in ‘bua, ‘d like in ‘dia, ‘w like in ‘wara and ‘y like in ‘yetaa. Letters are pronounced as follows: Ah, Ba, Cha, Da, Eh, Fa, Ga, Ha, Ie, Ja, Ka, La, Ma, Na, Oh, Pa, Ra, Sa, Ta, Uuw, Va, Wa, Ya, and Za.\n\nSome words are borrowed from other languages, for example Safari (journey) from Swahili, Buku (book) from English, Kandi (ball) from Lingala, etc. Also in the vocabulary, there are several words that have varied meanings when pronounced differently, for instance Oli can mean air, wind (also Oliriko), whistle, cut or roll.\n\nGrandfather (a’bi)\n\nGrandmother (dede, e’di)\n\nGrandson (mvia)\n\nGranddaughter (zia)\n\nFather (ati, ata)\n\nMother (andri, andre, ayia)\n\nHusband (agupi)\n\nWife (oku)\n\nSon (agupiamva, mvi)\n\nDaughter (zamva, zi)\n\nBrother (adrii)\n\nSister (amvii)\n\nUncles (atapuruka, [maternal - adroyi, paternal - adropi])\n\nAunts (andrapuruka)\n\nCousin (atapurumva)\n\nCousin brother (atapuruka anzi)\n\nCousin sister (atapuruka ezopi)\n\nNephews (adro anzi)\n\nNieces (adro ezoanzi, ezaapi)\n\nFather-in-law (anya)\n\nMother-in-law (edra)\n\nBrother-in-law (otuo)\n\nSister-in-law (onyere)\n\n1 week (Sabatu alu, sabiti alu)\n\nA day is called O’du in Lugbara.\n\nSunday (Sabatu, sabiti, yinga, yumula)\n\nMonday (O’du alu)\n\nTuesday (O’du iri)\n\nWednesday (O’du na)\n\nThursday (O’du su)\n\nFriday (O’du towi)\n\nSaturday (O’du azia)\n\nThe simplest way to refer to months (Mba in Lugbara) is to use numbers, for example January is Mba Alu, February is Mba Iri, May is Mba Towi and so on. But below is the other Latinized (and seasonal) way of mentioning them.\n\nJanuari (Oco ‘dupa sere)\n\nFeburili (Kulini)\n\nMarici (Zengulu)\n\nAprili (Ayi – Wet season)\n\nMayi (Mayi)\n\nJuni (Emveki)\n\nJulayi (Irri)\n\nAgoslo (Iripaku)\n\nSebitemba (Lokopere)\n\nOkitoba (Abibi)\n\nNovemba (Waa)\n\nDesemba (Anyu fi kuma)\n\nEka (red)\n\nImve (white)\n\nImve silili, imve whilili (very pure white)\n\nIni (black)\n\nInibiricici, inicici (very dark)\n\nEmvesi-enisi (black and white)\n\nForo [foro] (gray)\n\nForoto (grayish)\n\nTo study Lugbara, you might need a language teacher or guide but knowing the pronunciation basics and vocabulary preferably from a dictionary can give you a very good start. Practice by talking to natives physically or online and listening to Lugbara music.\n\n"}
{"id": "37299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37299", "title": "Malayalam", "text": "Malayalam\n\nMalayalam (; ) is a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala and the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mahé) by the Malayali people and it is one of 22 scheduled languages of India. Malayalam has official language status in the state of Kerala and in the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mahé). It belongs to the Dravidian family of languages and is spoken by 38 million people worldwide. Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states; with significant number of speakers in the Nilgiris, Kanyakumari and Coimbatore districts of Tamil Nadu, and Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka. Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf, the language is also widely spoken in Gulf countries.\n\nThe origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars. One view holds that Malayalam and modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the . A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of \"Proto-Dravidian\" or \"Proto-Tamil-Malayalam\" in the prehistoric era. Designated a \"Classical Language in India\" in 2013, it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century. The oldest documents written purely in Malayalam and still surviving are the Vazhappalli Copper plates from 832 CE and Tharisapalli Copper plates from 849 CE.\n\nThe earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu alphabet, and later the Kolezhuttu, which derived from it. The current Malayalam script is based on the Vatteluttu script, which was extended with Grantha script letters to adopt Indo-Aryan loanwords from Sanskrit.. The oldest literary work in Malayalam, distinct from the Tamil tradition, is dated from between the 9th and 11th centuries. The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam \"Varthamanappusthakam\", written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785.\n\nThe word \"Malayalam\" originated from the words \"mala\", meaning \"mountain\", and \"alam\", meaning \"region\" or \"-ship\" (as in \"township\"); \"Malayalam\" thus translates directly as \"the mountain region.\" The term originally referred to the land of the Chera dynasty Tamil dynasty, and only later became the name of its language. The language Malayalam is alternatively called \"Alealum\", \"Malayalani\", \"Malayali\", \"Malean\", \"Maliyad\", and \"Mallealle\".\n\nThe earliest extant literary works in the regional language of present-day Kerala probably date back to as early as the 12th century. However, the named identity of this language appears to have come into existence only around the 16th century, when it was known as \"Malayayma\" or \"Malayanma\"; the words were also used to refer to the script and the region. The word \"Malayalam\" was coined in the later period, and the local people referred to their language as both \"Tamil\" and \"Malayalam\" until the colonial period.\n\nThe generally held view is that Malayalam was the western coastal dialect of Tamil and separated from Tamil sometime between the 9th and 13th centuries. Some scholars however believe that both Tamil and Malayalam developed during the prehistoric period from a common ancestor, 'Proto-Tamil-Dravidian', and that the notion of Malayalam being a 'daughter' of Tamil is misplaced. This is based on the fact that Malayalam and several Dravidian languages on the western coast have common features which are not found even in the oldest historical forms of Tamil.\n\nRobert Caldwell, in his 1856 book \"A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages\", opined that Malayalam branched from \"Classical Tamil\" and over time gained a large amount of Sanskrit vocabulary and lost the personal terminations of verbs. As the language of scholarship and administration, Old-Tamil, which was written in Tamil-Brahmi and the Vatteluttu alphabet later, greatly influenced the early development of Malayalam. The Malayalam script began to diverge from the Tamil-Brahmi script in the 8th and 9th centuries CE. And by the end of the 13th century a written form of the language emerged which was unique from the Tamil-Brahmi script that was used to write Tamil.\nMalayalam is similar to some Sri Lankan Tamil dialects, and the two are often mistaken by native Indian Tamil speakers.\nMalayalam-Tamil otherwise called Malayanma or Malabar Thamozhi was the language of Western Tamils of Chera dynasty. Malabar Thamozhi was a variant of Tamil which was the vernacular mass language of Kerala used by majority of Malayalis until 1820 AD when British decided to change it to Grantha Malayalayalam written with Tigalari script used then by a minority of Northern people. Malayanma was written using different scritpts including Malayanma Script, Vatteluttu alphabet, Kolezhuthu and Tamil script.\nPorutuguese called it Lingua Malabar Tamul and used Portuguese or Tamil Script. Early Syriac Chrisitians used a form of Malayalam-Tamil which they called Karzoni. The Malayalam-Tamil the Dravidian tongue used by the indigenous people of Kerala was devoid of Sanskrit or Hindi words.\n\nLingua Malabar Tamul\nPortuguese called the Malalyalam-Tamil variant of Kerala as Lingua Malabar Tamul. This was also called Malabar Thamozhi. First book to be printed in Lingua Malabar Tamul was Cartilha in 1554 which used Portuguese letters to write the Malabar Thamozhi.\n\nKhristiani Vanakkam printed at Cochin in 1579 by Henriques. Muttuchira Church inscription uses Vatteluthu script to write Malayalam-Tamil in 1580.\n\nRavikutty Pilla Por written in the 17th century is the shining example of Malayanma style literature. Ananthapuri Varnanam written in 1800s among the last of these Malayalam-Tamil books. \nItty Achudan the famed Ayurvedic Physician used Malayanma and Kolezhuttu to write Hortus Malabaricus in 1678 AD (which was translated to Latin).\nIn the 17th century Malayanma Script was extensively used by the Catholics of Kerala. Samkshepa Vedartham in Malayalma was printed at Rome in 1772. Ramban Bible written in Malayalma was translated from Syriac by Fr.Phillipose and was published at 1811 AD. After this period British banned Malaynma and most of the books written in Malayanma disappeared. British never supported or Translated Malaynma books into Grantha Malayalam which they chose to promote in the 19th century. Iravikutti Pilla Por, Vadakkan Pattu, Thacholi Pattu, Kannassa Ramayanam, Ramacharitham Ananthapuri Varnanam are few of the Malayanma books which have survived. The Malayanma the indigenous Dravidian tongue and its great literary tradition was lost in history\n\nAt the 12th century Kerala was invaded by Tulu Bana Kings with an army from Ahichatra in the Indo-Nepalese border. Keralolpathi mentions a Tulu invader called Banapperumal who was the brother of Tulu king Kavi Raja Singhan (Kavi Alupendra 1110-1170) of Alupa dynasty who invaded Kerala with a Large Nair army led by Pada Mala Nair. Banapperumal establishe his capital at Valapattanam near Kannur. Banapperumals son was Udayavarman Kolathiri the first of Kolathiri dynasty which was the result of Tulu invasion.\nThe Tamil Chera dynasty of Villavar Tamils was shifted to Kollam following this attack. Kerala was under the Pandyan Dynasty who encouraged Tamil writing. \n\nAfter the defeat of Pandyan Dynasty in 1310 AD by Malik Kafur of Delhi Sulhtanate all the Tamil dynasties were replaced by Tulu Samantha dynasties under the overlordship of Kolathiri Kingdom. The Kolathiris and other Matriarchal Tulu dynasties of Kerala ruled with the help of an army drawn from Ahichatra in the Indo-Neplaese border. The establishment of Tulu-Nepalese rule over Kerala led to Sanskritization of Malayalam-Tamil and loan words from Tulu, Kannada, Nepalese and Hindi inserted into Malayalam. Tigalari script which was used to write Tulu language in Karnataka was beginning to be used to write the Sanskritised Malayalam called Granthamalayalam was used by the ruling Tulu-Nepalese elite of Kerala after 1314 AD. Grantha Malayalam books though appeared in in the 16th century, Malayalam-Tamil or Malayanma continued to be the Vernacular language of Kerala until 19th century.\nTwo versions of Grantha Malayalam existed in that era. Grantha Bhasa (Sanskrit language) with few Malayalam words and Grantha Malayalam which had more Malayalam words and less Sanskrit words. The domination of Tulu-Nepalese rulers over Kerala gradually changed the local Malayalam-Tamil by mixing with Sanskrit, Hindi and Nepalese loan words.\n\nJohann Ernst Hanxleden was a German missionary who was the first ever European to write the Grammer book for Grantha Malayalam called Grantha Bhasayuide Vyakaranam in 1700s. The Discovery that Sanskrit was related to German made the German missionaries promote Sanaskrit and Grantha Malayalam at the expense of Malayalam-Tamil. in 1819 Benjamin Bailey (missionary) created the first Malayalam (Grantha Malayalam) types. Benjamin Bailey published a first Malayalam (Grantha Malayalam) with Tigalari script with the help of Chandu Menon from Ottappalam converted to Christianity and bore the name Joseph Fenn and Yakob Ramavarman in CMS Kottayam. (In that era Christians were using Malayalam-Tamil language hence did not participate in the printing of first Malayalam Bible)\nBritish promoted Grantha Malayalam in the name New Malayayma.\nHermann Gundert in 1848 published the first ever Malayalam Newspaper called Rajyasamacharam from Thalassery. German and Dutch missionaries played a major role in the promotion of Grantha Malayalam in Kerala leading to its adoption by Christians by mid 19th century.\n\nVariations in intonation patterns, vocabulary, and distribution of grammatical and phonological elements are observable along the parameters of region, religion, community, occupation, social stratum, style and register.\n\nDialects of Malayalam are distinguishable at regional and social levels, including occupational and also communal differences. The salient features of many varieties of tribal speech (e.g., the speech of Muthuvans, Malayarayas, Malai Ulladas, Kanikkars, Kadars, Paliyars, Kurumas, and Vedas) and those of the various dialects Namboothiris, Nairs, Ezhavas, Syrian Christians (Nasrani), Latin Christians, Muslims, fishermen and many of the occupational terms common to different sections of Malayalees have been identified.\n\nAccording to the Dravidian Encyclopedia, the regional dialects of Malayalam can be divided into thirteen dialect areas. They are as follows:\nAccording to Ethnologue, the dialects are: Malabar, Nagari-Malayalam, South Kerala, Central Kerala, North Kerala, Kayavar, Namboodiri, Nair, Moplah (Mapilla), Pulaya, Nasrani, and Kasargod. The community dialects are: Namboodiri, Nair, Moplah (Mapilla), Pulaya, and Nasrani. Whereas both the Namboothiri and Nair dialects have a common nature, the Mapilla dialect is among the most divergent of dialects, differing considerably from literary Malayalam.\n\nAs regards the geographical dialects of Malayalam, surveys conducted so far by the Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala restricted the focus of attention during a given study on one specific caste so as to avoid mixing up of more than one variable such as communal and geographical factors. Thus for examples, the survey of the Ezhava dialect of Malayalam, results of which have been published by the Department in 1974, has brought to light the existence of twelve major dialect areas for Malayalam, although the isoglosses are found to crisscross in many instances. Sub-dialect regions, which could be marked off, were found to be thirty. This number is reported to tally approximately with the number of principalities that existed during the pre-British period in Kerala. In a few instances at least, as in the case of Venad, Karappuram, Nileswaram and Kumbala, the known boundaries of old principalities are found to coincide with those of certain dialects or sub-dialects that retain their individuality even today. This seems to reveal the significance of political divisions in Kerala in bringing about dialect difference.\n\nDivergence among dialects of Malayalam embrace almost all aspects of language such as phonetics, phonology, grammar and vocabulary. Differences between any two given dialects can be quantified in terms of the presence or absence of specific units at each level of the language. To cite a single example of language variation along the geographical parameter, it may be noted that there are as many as seventy seven different expressions employed by the Ezhavas and spread over various geographical points just to refer to a single item, namely, the flower bunch of coconut. 'Kola' is the expression attested in most of the panchayats in the Palakkad, Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts of Kerala, whereas 'kolachil' occurs most predominantly in Kannur and Kochi and 'klannil' in Alappuzha and Kollam. 'Kozhinnul' and 'kulannilu' are the forms most common in Trissur Idukki and Kottayam respectively. In addition to these forms most widely spread among the areas specified above, there are dozens of other forms such as 'kotumpu' (Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram), 'katirpu' (Kottayam), krali (Pathanamthitta), pattachi, gnannil (Kollam), 'pochata' (Palakkad) etc. referring to the same item.\n\nIt may be noted at this point that labels such as \"Brahmin Dialect\" and \"Syrian Caste Dialect\" refer to overall patterns constituted by the sub-dialects spoken by the subcastes or sub-groups of each such caste. The most outstanding features of the major communal dialects of Malayalam are summarized below:\nMalayalam has incorporated many elements from other languages over the years, the most notable of these being Sanskrit and later, English. According to Sooranad Kunjan Pillai who compiled the authoritative Malayalam lexicon, the other principal languages whose vocabulary was incorporated over the ages were Pali, Prakrit, Urdu, Hindi, Chinese, Arabic, Syriac, Dutch and Portuguese.\n\nMany medieval liturgical texts were written in an admixture of Sanskrit and early Malayalam, called Manipravalam. The influence of Sanskrit was very prominent in formal Malayalam used in literature. Malayalam has a substantially high amount of Sanskrit loan words but are seldom used. Loan words and influences also from Hebrew, Syriac and Ladino abound in the Jewish Malayalam dialects, as well as English, Portuguese, Syriac and Greek in the Christian dialects, while Arabic and Persian elements predominate in the Muslim dialects. The Muslim dialect known as Mappila Malayalam is used in the Malabar region of Kerala. Another Muslim dialect called Beary bashe is used in the extreme northern part of Kerala and the southern part of Karnataka.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of loan words, see Loan words in Malayalam.\n\nMalayalam is a language spoken by the native people of southwestern India (from Talapady to Kanyakumari).According to the Indian census of 2011, there were 32,299,239 speakers of Malayalam in Kerala, making up 93.2% of the total number of Malayalam speakers in India, and 96.74% of the total population of the state. There were a further 701,673 (2.1% of the total number) in Karnataka, 957,705 (2.7%) in Tamil Nadu, and 406,358 (1.2%) in Maharashtra. The number of Malayalam speakers in Lakshadweep is 51,100, which is only 0.15% of the total number, but is as much as about 84% of the population of Lakshadweep. In all, Malayalis made up 3.22% of the total Indian population in 2011. Of the total 34,713,130 Malayalam speakers in India in 2011, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the \"Yerava\" dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like \"Eranadan\". As per the 1991 census data, 28.85% of all Malayalam speakers in India spoke a second language and 19.64% of the total knew three or more languages.\n\nLarge numbers of Malayalis have settled in Chennai (Madras), Bangalore, Mangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai (Bombay), Navi Mumbai , Pune, Mysore and Delhi. A large number of Malayalis have also emigrated to the Middle East, the United States, and Europe. There were 179,860 speakers of Malayalam in the United States, according to the 2000 census, with the highest concentrations in Bergen County, New Jersey and Rockland County, New York. There are 172,000 of Malayalam speakers in Malaysia. There were 7,093 Malayalam speakers in Australia in 2006. The 2001 Canadian census reported 7,070 people who listed Malayalam as their mother tongue, mainly in Toronto, Ontario. The 2006 New Zealand census reported 2,139 speakers. 134 Malayalam speaking households were reported in 1956 in Fiji. There is also a considerable Malayali population in the Persian Gulf regions, especially in Dubai and Doha.\n\nFor the consonants and vowels, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbol is given, followed by the Malayalam character and the ISO 15919 transliteration.\n\n\nMalayalam has also borrowed the Sanskrit diphthongs of (represented in Malayalam as , au) and (represented in Malayalam as , ai), although these mostly occur only in Sanskrit loanwords. Traditionally (as in Sanskrit), four vocalic consonants (usually pronounced in Malayalam as consonants followed by the \"saṁvr̥tōkāram\", which is not officially a vowel, and not as actual vocalic consonants) have been classified as vowels: vocalic r (, , r̥), long vocalic r (, , r̥̄), vocalic l (, , l̥) and long vocalic l (, , l̥̄). Except for the first, the other three have been omitted from the current script used in Kerala as there are no words in current Malayalam that use them.\n\n\nMalayalam numbers and fractions are written as follows. These are archaic and no longer commonly used. Note that there is a confusion about the glyph of Malayalam digit zero. The correct form is oval-shaped, but occasionally the glyph for () is erroneously shown as the glyph for 0.\n\nMalayalam has a canonical word order of SOV (subject–object–verb) as do other Dravidian languages. A rare OSV word order occurs in interrogative clauses when the interrogative word is the subject. Both adjectives and possessive adjectives precede the nouns they modify. Malayalam has 6 or 7 grammatical cases. Verbs are conjugated for tense, mood and aspect, but not for person, gender or number except in archaic or poetic language.\n\nThe declensional paradigms for some common nouns and pronouns are given below. As Malayalam is an agglutinative language, it is difficult to delineate the cases strictly and determine how many there are, although seven or eight is the generally accepted number. Alveolar plosives and nasals (although the modern Malayalam script does not distinguish the latter from the dental nasal) are underlined for clarity, following the convention of the National Library at Kolkata romanization.\n\nVocative forms are given in parentheses after the nominative, as the only pronominal vocatives that are used are the third person ones, which only occur in compounds.\n\nThe following are examples of some of the most common declension patterns.\n\nWhen words are adopted from Sanskrit, their endings are usually changed to conform to Malayalam norms:\n\n\nHistorically, several scripts were used to write Malayalam. Among these were the Vatteluttu, Kolezhuthu and Malayanma scripts. But it was the Grantha script, another Southern Brahmi variation, which gave rise to the modern Malayalam script. It is syllabic in the sense that the sequence of graphic elements means that syllables have to be read as units, though in this system the elements representing individual vowels and consonants are for the most part readily identifiable. In the 1960s Malayalam dispensed with many special letters representing less frequent conjunct consonants and combinations of the vowel /u/ with different consonants.\n\nMalayalam script consists of a total of 578 characters. The script contains 52 letters including 16 vowels and 36 consonants, which forms 576 syllabic characters, and contains two additional diacritic characters named anusvāra and visarga. The earlier style of writing has been superseded by a new style as of 1981. This new script reduces the different letters for typesetting from 900 to fewer than 90. This was mainly done to include Malayalam in the keyboards of typewriters and computers.\n\nIn 1999 a group named \"Rachana Akshara Vedi\" produced a set of free fonts containing the entire character repertoire of more than 900 glyphs. This was announced and released along with a text editor in the same year at Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala. In 2004, the fonts were released under the GNU GPL license by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation at the Cochin University of Science and Technology in Kochi, Kerala.\n\nMalayalam has been written in other scripts like Roman, Syriac and Arabic. Suriyani Malayalam was used by Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Nasranis) until the 19th century. Arabic scripts particularly were taught in madrasahs in Kerala and the Lakshadweep Islands.\n\nThe earliest Malayalam inscription discovered until now is the Edakal-5 inscription (ca. late 4th century - early 5th century CE).\nThe early literature of Malayalam comprised three types of composition:\nMalayalam Nada, Tamil Nada and Sanskrit Nada.\n\nMalayalam poetry to the late 20th century betrays varying degrees of the fusion of the three different strands. The oldest examples of Pattu and Manipravalam, respectively, are \"Ramacharitam\" and \"Vaishikatantram\", both from the 12th century.\n\nThe earliest extant prose work in the language is a commentary in simple Malayalam, \"Bhashakautalyam\" (12th century) on Chanakya's \"Arthashastra\". Adhyatmaramayanam by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan (known as the father of the Malayalam language) who was born in Tirur, one of the most important works in Malayalam literature. Unnunili Sandesam written in the 14th century is amongst the oldest literary works in Malayalam language.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century some of the Christian missionaries from Kerala started writing in Malayalam but mostly travelogues, dictionaries and religious books. Varthamanappusthakam (1778), written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar is considered to be the first travelogue in an Indian language.\n\nThe earliest known poem in Malayalam, \"Ramacharitam\", dated to the 12th to 14th century CE, was completed before the introduction of the Sanskrit alphabet. It shows the same phase of the language as in Jewish and Nasrani \"Sasanas\" (dated to mid‑8th century A.D.). But the period of the earliest available literary document cannot be the sole criterion used to determine the antiquity of a language. In its early literature, Malayalam has songs, \"Pattu\", for various subjects and occasions, such as harvesting, love songs, heroes, gods, etc. A form of writing called \"Campu\" emerged from the 14th century onwards. It mixed poetry with prose and used a vocabulary strongly influenced by Sanskrit, with themes from epics and \"Puranas\".\"Rama-charitam\", which was composed in the 14th century A.D., may be said to have inaugurated Malayalam literature just as Naniah's Mahabharatam did for Telugu. The fact is that dialectical and local peculiarities had already developed and stamped themselves in local songs and ballads. But these linguistic variations were at last gathered together and made to give a coloring to a sustained literary work, the \"Rama-charitam\", thereby giving the new language a justification and a new lease on life.\n\nThe Malayalam language, with the introduction of a new type of devotional literature, underwent a metamorphosis, both in form and content, and it is generally held that modernity in Malayalam language and literature commenced at this period. This change was brought about by Thunchathu Ezhuthachan (16th century) who is known as the father of modern Malayalam. Till this time Malayalam indicated two different courses of development depending on its relationship with either Sanskrit or Tamil.\n\nThe earliest literary work in Malayalam now available is a prose commentary on Chanakya's Arthashastra, ascribed to the 13th century. The poetical works called \"Vaisikatantram\" are also believed to belong to the early 14th century. These works come under a special category known as Manipravalam, literally the combination of two languages, the language of Kerala and Sanskrit. A grammar and rhetoric in this hybrid style was written sometime in the 14th century in Sanskrit and the work, called the \"Lilatikalam\", is the main source of information for a student of literary and linguistic history.\n\nAccording to this book, the Manipravalam and Pattu styles of literary compositions were in vogue during this period. \"Pattu\" means \"song\" and more or less represents the pure Malayalam school of poetry. From the definition of the Pattu style given in the \"Lilatikalam\", it can be surmised that the language of Kerala during this period was more or less in line with Tamil, but this has misled many people to believe incorrectly that Malayalam was itself Tamil during this period and before.\n\nThe latest research shows that Malayalam as a separate spoken language in Kerala began showing independent lines of development from its parental tongue Proto-Tamil-Malayalam (which is not modern Tamil), preserving the features of the earliest Dravidian tongue, which only in due course gave birth to the literary form of Tamil, namely Sen Tamil and Malayalam, the spoken form of which is prevalent in Kerala. However, till the 13th century there is no hard evidence to show that the language of Kerala had a literary tradition except in folk songs.\n\nThe literary tradition consisted of three early Manipravalam Champus, a few Sandesa Kavyas and innumerable amorous compositions on the courtesans of Kerala, which throb with literary beauty and poetical fancies, combined with a relishing touch of realism about them with regard to the then social conditions. Many prose works in the form of commentaries upon Puranic episodes form the bulk of the classical works in Malayalam.\n\nThe Pattu (a sutra devoted to define this pattern is termed a \"pattu\") school also has major works like the Ramacharitam (12th century), and the Bhagavad Gita (14th century) by a set of poets belonging to one family called the Kannassas. Some of them like Ramacharitam have a close resemblance to the Tamil language during this period. This is to be attributed to the influence of Tamil works on native poets belonging to areas that lie close to the Tamil country.\n\nIt was during the 16th and 17th centuries that later Champu kavyas were written. Their specialty was that they contained both Sanskritic and indigenous elements of poetry to an equal degree, and in that manner were unique.\n\nUnnayi Varyar, whose Nalacharitan Attakkatha is popular even today, was the most prominent poet of the 18th century among not only the Kathakali writers, but also among the classical poets of Kerala. He is often referred to as the Kalidasa of Kerala. Although Kathakali is a dance drama and its literary form should more or less be modeled after the drama, there is nothing more in common between an Attakkatha and Sanskrit drama.\n\nThat is to say, the principles of dramaturgy to be observed in writing a particular type of Sanskrit drama are completely ignored by an author of Attakkatha. Delineation of a particular \"rasa\" is an inevitable feature with Sanskrit drama, whereas in an Attakkatha all the predominant \"rasas\" are given full treatment, and consequently the theme of an Attakkatha often loses its integrity and artistic unity when viewed as a literary work.\n\nAny Attakkatha fulfills its objective if it affords a variety of scenes depicting different types of characters, and each scene would have its own hero with the \"rasa\" associated with that character. When that hero is portrayed he is given utmost importance, to the utter neglect of the main sentiment (\"rasa\") of the theme in general. However, the purpose of Attakkatha is not to present a theme with a well-knit emotional plot as its central point, but to present all approved types of characters already set to suit the technique of the art of Kathakali.\n\nThe major literary output of the century was in the form of local plays composed for the art of kathakali, the dance dramas of Kerala also known as Attakkatha. It seems the \"Gitagovinda\" of Jayadeva provided a model for this type of literary composition. The verses in Sanskrit narrate the story and the dialogue is composed in imitation of songs in the \"Gitagovinda\", set to music in appropriate \"ragas\" in the classical Karnataka style.\n\nBesides the Raja of Kottarakkara and Unnayi Varyar referred to above, nearly a hundred plays were composed during this century by poets belonging to all categories and subscribing to all standards, such as Irayimman Tampi and Ashvati Raja, to mention just two.\n\nDevotional literature in Malayalam found its heyday during the early phase of this period. Ezhuthachan referred to above gave emphasis to the \"Bhakti\" cult. The \"Jnanappana\" by Puntanam Nambudiri is a unique work in the branch of philosophical poetry. Written in simple language, it is a sincere approach to the advaita philosophy of Vedanta.\n\nIt took nearly two centuries for a salutary blending of the scholarly Sanskrit and popular styles to bring Malayalam prose to its present form, enriched in its vocabulary by Sanskrit but at the same time flexible, pliable and effective as to popular parlance.\n\nAs regards literature, the leading figures were Irayimman Thampi and Vidwan Koithampuran, both poets of the royal court. Their works abound in a beautiful and happy blending of music and poetry. The former is surely the most musical poet of Kerala and his beautiful lullaby commencing with the line \"Omana Thinkalkidavo\" has earned him an everlasting name. But the prime reason why he is held in such high esteem in Malayalam is the contribution he has made to Kathakali literature by his three works, namely the \"Dakshayagam\", the \"Kichakavadham\" and the \"Uttara-svayamvaram\". The latter's Kathakali work \"Ravana Vijayam\" has made him immortal in literature.\n\nThe first printed book in Kerala was \"Doctrina Christam\", written by Henrique Henriques in Lingua Malabar Tamul. It was transliterated and translated into Malayalam, and printed by the Portuguese in 1578. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan was the first to substitute Grantha-Malayalam script for the Tamil Vatteluttu alphabet. Ezhuthachan, regarded as the father of the modern Malayalam language, undertook an elaborate translation of the ancient Indian epics \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" into Malayalam. His \"Adhyatma Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" are still read with religious reverence by the Malayalam-speaking Hindu community. Kunchan Nambiar, the founder of \"Tullal\", was a prolific literary figure of the 18th century.\n\nThe British printed Malabar English Dictionary by Graham Shaw in 1779 was still in the form of a Tamil-English Dictionary. The Syrian Christians of Kerala started to learn the Tulu-Grantha Bhasha of Nambudiris under the British Tutelage. Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar wrote the first Malayalam travelogue called \"Varthamanappusthakam\" in 1789.\n\nThe educational activities of the missionaries belonging to the Basel Mission deserve special mention. Hermann Gundert, (1814 – 1893), a German missionary and scholar of exceptional linguistic talents, played a distinguishable role in the development of Malayalam literature. His major works are Keralolpathi (1843), Pazhancholmala (1845), Malayalabhaasha Vyakaranam (1851), \"Paathamala (1860) the first Malayalam school text book\", Kerala pazhama (1868), \"the first Malayalam dictionary (1872)\", Malayalarajyam (1879) - Geography of Kerala, \"Rajya Samacharam (1847 June) the first Malayalam news paper\", Paschimodayam (1879) - Magazine. He lived in Thalassery for around 20 years. He learned the language from well established local teachers Ooracheri Gurukkanmar from Chokli, a village near Thalassery and consulted them in works. He also translated the Bible into Malayalam.\n\nIn 1821, the Church Mission Society (CMS) at Kottayam in association with the Syriac Orthodox Church started a seminary at Kottayam in 1819 and started printing books in Malayalam when Benjamin Bailey, an Anglican priest, made the first Malayalam types. In addition, he contributed to standardizing the prose. Hermann Gundert from Stuttgart, Germany, started the first Malayalam newspaper, \"Rajya Samacaram\" in 1847 at Talasseri. It was printed at Basel Mission. Malayalam and Sanskrit were increasingly studied by Christians of Kottayam and Pathanamthitta. By the end of the 19th century Malayalam replaced Syriac as language of Liturgy in the Syrian Christian churches.\n\nThanks to the efforts of kings like Swathi Thirunal and to the assistance given by him to the Church Mission and London Mission Societies, a number of schools were started.\n\nThe establishment of the Madras University in 1857 marks an important event in the cultural history of Kerala. It is from here that a generation of scholars well versed in Western literature and with the capacity to enrich their own language by adopting Western literary trends came into being. Prose was the first branch to receive an impetus by its contact with English. Though there was no shortage of prose in Malayalam, it was not along Western lines. It was left to the farsighted policy of the Maharaja of Travancore (1861 to 1880) to start a scheme for the preparation of textbooks for use by schools in the state. Kerala Varma V, a scholar in Sanskrit, Malayalam and English was appointed Chairman of the Committee formed to prepare textbooks. He wrote several books suited for various standards.\n\nThe growth of journalism, too, helped in the development of prose. Initiated by missionaries for the purpose of religious propaganda, journalism was taken up by local scholars who started newspapers and journals for literary and political activities.\n\nVengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar, (1861-1914) from Thalassery was the author of first Malayalam short story, Vasanavikriti. After him innumerable world class literature works by was born in Malayalam.\n\nWith his work \"Kundalatha\" in 1887, Appu Nedungadi marks the origin of prose fiction in Malayalam. Other talented writers were Chandu Menon, the author of \"Indulekha\", a great social novel, in 1889 and another called \"Sarada\". Also there was C V Raman Pillai, who wrote the historical novel \"Marthandavarma\" in 1890 as well as works like Dharmaraja, and Ramaraja Bahadur.\n\nIn poetry there were two main trends, one represented by Venmani Nampoodiris(venmani Poets) and the other by Kerala Varma. The latter's poetry was modeled on the old Manipravalam style abounding in Sanskrit words and terms, but it had a charm of its own when adapted to express new ideas in that masterly way characteristic of himself. His translation of Kalidasa's \"Abhijnanasakuntalam\" in 1882 marks an important event in the history of Malayalam drama and poetry. Also Kerala Varma's \"Mayura-sandesam\" is a \"Sandesakavya\" (messenger poem) written after the manner of Kalidasa's \"Meghadutam\". Though it cannot be compared with the original, it was still one of the most popularly acclaimed poems in Malayalam.\n\nOne of the notable features of the early decades of the 20th century was the great interest taken by writers in translating works from Sanskrit and English into Malayalam. Kalidasa's \"Meghaduta\" and \"Kumarasambhava\" by A. R. Raja Raja Varma and the \"Raghuvamsa\" by K. N. Menon must be mentioned. One of the most successful of the later translators was C. S. Subramaniam Potti who set a good model by his translation of the \"Durgesanandini\" of Bankim Chandra from an English version of it.\n\nThe early decades of the 20th century saw the beginning of a period of rapid development of all branches of Malayalam literature. A good number of authors familiar with the latest trends in English literature came forward to contribute to the enrichment of their mother tongue. Their efforts were directed more to the development of prose than poetry.\nSeveral Bengali novels were translated during this period. C. S. S. Potti, mentioned above, also brought out the \"Lake of Palms\" of R. C. Dutt under the title \"Thala Pushkarani\", \"Kapalakundala\" by V. K. Thampi and \"Visha Vruksham\" by T. C. Kalyani Amma were also translations of novels by Bankimochandra Chatterji.\n\nAmong the original novels written at that time only a few are worth mentioning, such as \"Bhootha Rayar\" by Appan Thampuran, \"Keraleswaran\" by Raman Nambeesan and \"Cheraman Perumal\" by K. K. Menon. Although a large number of social novels were produced during this period, only a few are remembered, such as \"Snehalatha\" by Kannan Menon, \"Hemalatha\" by T. K. Velu Pillai and \"Kambola-balika\" by N. K. Krishna Pillai. But by far the most inspiring work of that time was \"Aphante Makal\" by M. B. Namboodiri, who directed his literary talents towards the abolition of old worn-out customs and manners which had for years been the bane of the community.\n\nShort stories came into being. With the advent of E. V. Krishna Pillai, certain marks of novelty became noticeable in the short story. His \"Keleesoudham\" proved his capacity to write with considerable emotional appeal.\n\nC. V. Raman Pillai was a pioneer in prose dramas. He had a particular knack for writing dramas in a lighter vein. His \"Kurupillakalari\" of 1909 marks the appearance of the first original Malayalam prose drama. It is a satirical drama intended to ridicule the Malayali official classes who started imitating Western fashion and etiquette. There were other authors, less well-known, who wrote in this vein.\n\nUnder the guidance of A. Balakrishna Pillai, a progressive school of authors appeared in almost all branches of literature, such as the novel, the short story, the drama, and criticism.\n\nKumaran Asan's celebrated poem, \"Veena Poovu\" (\"The Fallen Flower\") depicts in a symbolic manner the tragedy of human life in a moving and thought-provoking manner. Vallathol's \"Bandhanasthanaya Aniruddhan\", which demonstrates an exceptionally brilliant power of imagination and deep emotional faculties, depicts a situation from the Puranic story of Usha and Aniruddha. Ulloor S. P. Iyer was another veteran who joined the new school. He wrote a series of poems like \"Oru Mazhathulli\" in which he excelled as a romantic poet.\n\nThe three more or less contemporary poets Kumaran Asan, Vallathol Narayana Menon\nand Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer considerably enriched Malayalam poetry. Some of their works reflect social and political movements of that time. Asan wrote about untouchability in Kerala; Ullor's writings reflect his deep devotion and admiration for the great moral and spiritual values, which he believed were the real assets of ancient social life of India. They were known as the trio of Malayalam poetry. After them there were others like K. K. Nair and K. M. Panikkar who contributed to the growth of poetry.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Marwari is also found in the neighboring state of Gujarat and Haryana, Eastern Pakistan and some migrant communities in himalayan country Nepal. With some 20 million or so speakers (ce. 2001), it is one of the largest varieties of Rajasthani. Most speakers live in Rajasthan, with a quarter million in Sindh and a tenth that number in Nepal. There are two dozen dialects of Marwari.\n\nMarwari is popularly written in Devanagari script, as is Hindi, Marathi, Nepali and Sanskrit; although it was historically written in Mahajani. Marwari currently has no official status as a language of education and government. There has been a push in the recent past for the national government to recognize this language and give it a scheduled status. The state of Rajasthan recognizes Rajasthani as a language.\n\nIn Pakistan, there are two varieties of Marwari. They may or may not be close enough to Indian Marwari to be considered the same language. Marwari speakers are concentrated in Sindh. In Pakistan, Marwari is generally written using a modified version of the Arabic script\n\nMarwari is still spoken widely in and around Bikaner. There are ongoing efforts to identify and classify this language cluster and the language differences.\n\nIt is said that Marwari and Gujarati evolved from \"Gujjar Bhakha\" or \"Maru-Gurjar\", language of the Gurjars. Formal grammar of Gurjar Apabhraṃśa was written by Jain monk and eminent Gujarati scholar Hemachandra Suri.\n\nMarwari is primarily spoken in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Marwari speakers have dispersed widely throughout India and other countries but are found most notably in the neighboring state of Gujarat and in Eastern Pakistan. Speakers are also found in Bhopal. With some 13.2 million speakers (in 1997, ca. 13 million in India and 200,000 in Pakistan) it is the largest of the Marwari subgroup.\n\nThere are several dialects: Thaḷī (spoken in eastern Jaisalmer district and northwestern Jodhpur district), Bāgṛī (near Haryana), Bhitrauti, Sirohī, Godwārī.\n\nIt shares a 50%-65% lexical similarity with Hindi (this is based on a Swadesh 210 word list comparison). Marwari has many cognate words with Hindi. Notable phonetic correspondences include /s/ in Hindi with /h/ in Marwari. For example, /sona/ 'gold' (Hindi) and /hono/ 'gold' (Marwari).\n\n/h/ sometimes elides. There are also a variety of vowel changes. Most of the pronouns and interrogatives are, however, distinct from those of Hindi.\n\nMarwari language has a structure that is quite similar to Hindi. Its primary word order is subject–object–verb. Most of the pronouns and interrogatives used in Marwari are distinct from those used in Hindi. At least Marwari proper and Harauti have a clusivity distinction.\n\nMarwari Vocabulary is somewhat similar to other Western Indo-Aryan languages, especially Rajasthani and Gujarati, however, elements of grammar and basic terminology differ enough to significantly impede mutual intelligibility. In addition, Marwari uses many words found in Sanskrit (the ancestor of most North Indian languages) which are not found in Hindi.\n\nMarwari is generally written in the Devanagari script, although the Mahajani script is traditionally associated with the language. Traditionally it was written in Mahajani script (which does not have vowels, only consonants). In Pakistan it is written in the Perso-Arabic script with modifications. Historical Marwari orthography for Devanagari uses other characters in place of standard Devanagari letters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1455599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1455599", "title": "Modern Standard Arabic", "text": "Modern Standard Arabic\n\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA; ' 'the most eloquent Arabic language'), Standard Arabic, or Literary Arabic is the standardized and literary variety of Arabic used in writing and in most formal speech throughout the Arab world to facilitate communication. It is considered a pluricentric language.\n\nMost Western scholars distinguish two standard ' () varieties of Arabic: the Classical Arabic (CA) ( ') of the Quran and early Islamic (7th to 9th centuries) literature, and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) ( '), the standard language in use today. MSA is based on classical Arabic, and differences between the two varieties of the language are directly related to modernizing and simplification, both in speaking and writing styles. Most Arabic speakers consider the two varieties to be two registers of one language, although the two registers can be referred to in Arabic as ' (MSA) and \"\" (CA).\n\nClassical Arabic, also known as Quranic Arabic (although the term is not entirely accurate), is the language used in the Quran as well as in numerous literary texts from Umayyad and Abbasid times (7th to 9th centuries). Many Muslims study Classical Arabic in order to read the Quran in its original language. It is important to note that written Classical Arabic underwent fundamental changes during the early Islamic era, adding dots to distinguish similarly written letters, and adding the Tashkeel (diacritical markings that guide pronunciation) by Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali, Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi, and other scholars. It was the lingua franca across the Middle East, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa during ancient times.\n\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the literary standard across the Middle East, North Africa and Horn of Africa, and is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Most printed material by the Arab League—including most books, newspapers, magazines, official documents, and reading primers for small children—is written in MSA. It was developed in the early part of the 19th century. \"Colloquial\" Arabic refers to the many regional dialects derived from Classical Arabic spoken daily across the region and learned as a first language, and as second language if people speak other languages native to their particular country. They are not normally written, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry (including songs)) exists in many of them. Literary Arabic (MSA) is the official language of all Arab League countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages. Additionally, some Christian Arabic speakers recite prayers in it, as it is considered the literary language. Bibles are written in MSA aside from Classical Arabic. MSA is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Qur'an, and some Muslim Arabic speakers recite prayers in it; revised editions of numerous literary texts from Umayyad and Abbasid times also are written in MSA.\n\nThe sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossiathe use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts. This diglossic situation facilitates code-switching in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two dialects of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. People speak MSA as a third language if they speak other languages native to a country as their first language and colloquial Arabic dialects as their second language. Modern Standard Arabic is also spoken by people of Arab descent outside the Arab world when people of Arab descent speaking different dialects communicate to each other. As there is a prestige or standard dialect of vernacular Arabic, speakers of standard colloquial dialects code-switch between these particular dialects and MSA.\n\nClassical Arabic is considered normative; a few contemporary authors attempt (with varying degrees of success) to follow the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as Sibawayh) and to use the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the \"Lisan al-Arab\" ِ).\n\nHowever, the exigencies of modernity have led to the adoption of numerous terms which would have been mysterious to a classical author, whether taken from other languages (e. g. \"film\") or coined from existing lexical resources (e. g. \"hātif\"  \"caller\" > \"telephone\"). Structural influence from foreign languages or from the vernaculars has also affected Modern Standard Arabic: for example, MSA texts sometimes use the format \"A, B, C, and D\" when listing things, whereas Classical Arabic prefers \"A and B and C and D\", and subject-initial sentences may be more common in MSA than in Classical Arabic. For these reasons, Modern Standard Arabic is generally treated separately in non-Arab sources. Arabic sources generally tend to regard MSA and Classical Arabic as different registers of one and the same language. Speakers of Modern Standard Arabic do not always observe the intricate rules of Classical Arabic grammar. Modern Standard Arabic principally differs from Classical Arabic in three areas: lexicon, stylistics, and certain innovations on the periphery that are not strictly regulated by the classical authorities. On the whole, Modern Standard Arabic is not homogeneous; there are authors who write in a style very close to the classical models and others who try to create new stylistic patterns. Add to this regional differences in vocabulary depending upon the influence of the local Arabic varieties and the influences of foreign languages, such as French in Africa and Lebanon or English in Egypt, Jordan, and other countries. As MSA is a revised and simplified form of Classical Arabic, MSA in terms of lexicon omitted the obsolete words used in Classical Arabic. As diglossia is involved, various Arabic dialects freely borrow words from MSA, this situation is similar to Romance languages, wherein scores of words were borrowed directly from formal Latin (most literate Romance speakers were also literate in Latin); educated speakers of standard colloquial dialects speak in this kind of communication.\n\nReading out loud in MSA for various reasons is becoming increasingly simpler, using less strict rules compared to CA, notably the inflection is omitted, making it closer to spoken varieties of Arabic. It depends on the speaker's knowledge and attitude to the grammar of Classical Arabic, as well as the region and the intended audience. \n\nPronunciation of native words, loanwords, foreign names in MSA is loose, names can be pronounced or even spelled differently in different regions and by different speakers. Pronunciation also depends on the person's education, linguistic knowledge and abilities. There may be sounds used, which are missing in the Classical Arabic but may exist in colloquial varieties - consonants - , , (often realized as +), these consonants may or may not be written with special letters; and vowels - , (both short and long), there are no special letters in Arabic to distinguish between and pairs but the sounds o and e (short and long) exist in the colloquial varieties of Arabic and some foreign words in MSA. The differentiation of pronunciation of informal dialects is the influence from other languages previously spoken and some still presently spoken in the regions, such as Coptic in Egypt, French, Ottoman Turkish, Italian, Spanish, Berber, Punic or Phoenician in North Africa, Himyaritic, Modern South Arabian and Old South Arabian in Yemen and Aramaic in the Levant.\n\n\nModern Standard Arabic, like Classical Arabic before it, has three pairs of long and short vowels: , , and :\nAcross North Africa and West Asia, short may be realized as before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and , , , depending on the accent. short can also have different realizations, i.e. . Sometimes with one value for each vowel in both short and long lengths or two different values for each short and long lengths. In Egypt, close vowels have different values; short initial or medial: ,  ← instead of . and completely become and respectively in some other particular dialects. Allophones of & // include & before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and , ; and & elsewhere. Allophones of include ~ before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and , , , . Allophones of include ~~ before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and , , , . Unstressed final long are most often shortened or reduced:  → ,  → ,  → .\n\nNotes\n\n\nDifferences between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic span the three categories of linguistics, which are syntax, terminology and pronunciation (especially in terms of tashkeel). Differences are also apparent in the use of punctuation and writing styles.\n\nIt should be mentioned that Arabic speakers do not find a noteworthy difference between these varieties, and may sometimes refer to both by the same name: \"Al-arabīyat ul-fuṣḥá\", \"the most eloquent Arabic language\".\n\nMSA tends to use simplified structures and drop more complicated ones commonly used in Classical Arabic. Some examples include reliance on verb sentences instead of noun phrases and semi-sentences, as well as avoiding phrasal adjectives and accommodating feminine forms of ranks and job titles.\n\nTerminology is the main domain where MSA and CA differ substantially. This stems from the need of MSA to adapt with modern-day terminology in the technical, literary, and scientific domains. The vast majority of these terms refer to items or concepts that did not exist in the time of CA. MSA tends to be more accepting to non-Arabic terminology. Despite the efforts of Arabic Language Academies in the second half of the 20th century to Arabize modern terminology using classical Arabization practices, the fast pace of modern development made transliteration the method of choice for Arabizing modern day terminology.\n\nModern Standard Arabic relies on transliteration to adopt modern day terminology.\n\nMSA differs from CA in the use of sounds not available in the Arabic script and diacritics (Tashkīl). Unlike Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic accepts the use of consonants that are not supported in the Arabic script, such as , and . Modern Standard Arabic normally does not use Tashkīl, but only in disambiguation and not the full word is diacriticized, while CA found in Quran and Hadith scriptures normally prefer indicating full diacritics.\n\nModern Standard Arabic has adopted several punctuation marks from other languages, and dropped some classical Arabic ones. Modern technology, especially in printing press and the use of the Internet, has contributed largely to this trend\n\nModern Standard Arabic adopts modern writing forms, such as essays, opinion articles, and technical reports, instead of classical ones. Moreover, some new writing forms are directly imported from foreign languages, such as guides, blog posts, and other forms of writing. Moreover, some classical writing forms disappeared completely, such as Maqam.\n\nMSA is loosely uniform across the Middle East. Regional variations exist due to influence from the spoken vernaculars. TV hosts who read prepared MSA scripts, for example in Al Jazeera, are ordered to give up national or ethnic pronunciations by changing their pronunciation of certain phonemes (e.g. the realization of the Classical \"\" as by Egyptians), though other traits may show the speaker's region, such as the stress and the exact value of vowels and the pronunciation of other consonants. People who speak MSA also mix vernacular and Classical in pronunciation, words, and grammatical forms. Classical/vernacular mixing in formal writing can also be found (e.g., in some Egyptian newspaper editorials); others are written in Modern Standard/vernacular mixing, including entertainment news.\n\nPeople who are literate in Modern Standard Arabic are primarily found in most countries of the Arab League. It may be assumed that the number of speakers of the language to be the number of literate people in this region, because it is compulsory in schools of most of the Arab League to learn Modern Standard Arabic. People who are literate in the language are usually more so passively, as they mostly use the language in reading and writing, not in speaking. It is also spoken by Muslims in Northern Nigeria by people with Islamic education (especially the Hausa and Fulani people).\n\nThe countries with the largest populations that mandate MSA be taught in all schools are, with rounded-up numbers (data from 2008—2014): \n\n\n"}

He made significant contributions to the novel, the short story, travelogue, criticism, memoir and drama.\n\nHe was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1968.\n\nBorn as Madan Mohan Guglani on 8 January 1925 in Amritsar, Punjab. His father a lawyer died when he was sixteen. He did his M.A. in English and Hindi from Punjab University, Lahore.\n\nHe started his career as a teacher at Elphinstone College, Bombay (now Mumbai) from 1947 to 1949, after that he shifted to Delhi, but found a teaching job in Jalandhar, Punjab for a short while. Subsequently, he remained Head of the Hindi department at DAV College, Jalandhar (Guru Nanak Dev University) and a school in Shimla for two years before coming back to teaching Jalandhar. Eventually, he resigned from his job in 1957 to write full-time. He also briefly edited Hindi literary journal \"Sarika\", from 1962-63.\n\nHis noted novels are \"Andhere Band Kamare\" (\"Closed Dark Rooms\") and \"Na Aane Wala Kal\" (The Tomorrow That Never Comes). His plays \"Ashadh Ka Ek Din\" (\"One Day in Aashad\") (1958), played a major role in reviving Hindi theatre in the 1960s and \"Adhe Adhure\" (The Incomplete Ones or Halfway House) (1969) are highly regarded. His debut play \"Ashadh Ka Ek Din\" was first performed by Kolkata-based Hindi theatre group \"Anamika\", under director Shyamanand Jalan (1960) and subsequently by Ebrahim Alkazi at National School of Drama Delhi in 1962, which established Mohan Rakesh as the first modern Hindi playwright. His plays continue to be performed and receive acclaim worldwide. \"One Day in the Season of Rain\", Aparna Dharwadker and Vinay Dharwadker's authorised English translation of \"Ashadh Ka Ek Din\", premiered at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States in 2010 and traveled to the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival (Region 3) in 2011.\n\n\"Lahron Ke Rajhans\" (\"The Swans of the Waves\"), a noted play of Mohan Rakesh about an ancient Buddhist tale on the renunciation of the Buddha, and its aftereffects on his close family, was first written as a short story and later turned into a radio play for All India Radio Jalandhar, and broadcast under the title \"Sundri\", though his struggle over different versions of the play lasted for nearly 20 years, before creating his masterpiece. Prominent Indian directors Om Shivpuri, Shyamanand Jalan, Arvind Gaur and Ram Gopal Bajaj directed this play. In 2005, this very writing process of the play, and Mohan Rakesh's diary, writings, and letters about the play, were recreated in a play titled \"Manuscript\", by a Delhi theatre group.\n\nHis story \"Uski Roti\" (One's Bread) was made into an eponymous film by Mani Kaul in 1971, for which he also wrote the dialogue.

It introduced, among other reforms, the diacritic signs ´ and ˇ which are now used in the Baltic languages Lithuanian and Latvian, in other Slavic languages like Croatian, Slovak, Slovenian and partly Polish, and in several other European languages.\n\nLiteracy in native languages became also one of the chief projects for the Czech Reformation including the first Hussites but especially for their later Unity of the Brethren branch with their bishop Comenius.\nWhile the author's identity and the precise date of authorship are unknown, it is widely held that the author is Jan Hus and the year of creation somewhere between 1406 and 1412, based on historical and philological studies.\n\nThe primary purpose of \"De orthographia bohemica\" was to simplify and unify Czech orthography in order to promote literacy by making the language \"clearer and easier\" to read and write. Instead of representing sounds using digraphs and trigraphs, it proposed a \"diacritic orthography\", where one letter indicates only one sound, and different but related sounds (such as those now represented by \"r\" and \"ř\") are distinguished by diacritics. Briefly, one can summarize the spelling changes in Orthographia Bohemica as follows:\n\n\nTo illustrate the simple and revolutionary nature of this spelling, take as an example the various ways of representing ř, compared with that seen in the grammar of Jan Gebauer. In manuscripts written before Hus, all of the following representations were in use: \"rz\", \"rrz\", \"rs\", \"rzs\", \"rzss\", \"zr\", \"sr\", \"rzs\" and \"rzz\". Long vowels were written either with no indication of the length, or written double (sometimes with the second letter written in superscript), or with any of a wide and unstandardized range of diacritical marks. One could not even assume that the same scribe would consistently use their own conventions, and their use often varied even within a single manuscript.\n\n\"Orthographia bohemica\" was the first known document in which such spelling reforms were suggested for a Slavic language. It is not yet fully clear where Jan Hus drew inspiration for this work. Considered in the context of the contemporaneous study of letters of St. Jerome by Danish scholars of Hebrew working at the Sorbonne, there was a good knowledge of such orthographic practices at the time (particularly the designation of long vowels). According to a study by F. V. Mareš, a stimulus for the project was the author's knowledge of Glagolitic, used by Croatian monks in the Emmaus Monastery (\"Na Slovanech\") in Prague.\n\nThe significance of the document lies in the longevity and wide application of its logical system of diacritics. Its impact is apparent in the \"Náměšťská mluvnice\" (\"Grammar of Náměšť\"), the first grammar of the Czech language, published in 1533, but the adoption of the new rules was relatively slow and far from uniform. Throughout the 16th century, some printers and typesetters ignored the prescriptions of \"Orthographia bohemica\" and continued to maintain some digraphs (e.g. \"ss\" for instead of \"š\"), although their use became considerably more uniform. In addition, scribes adopted the new rules much more slowly than book printers.\n\nThe manuscript for \"Orthographia bohemica\" was found by František Palacký on 13 August 1826, in Třeboň in the south of Bohemia. The public was made aware of the existence of the work a year later, with the first issue of the newly founded journal \"Časopis společnosti vlastenského Museum v Čechách\" (\"Journal of the Society of the National Museum in Bohemia\"), but its publication had to wait a further thirty years. The Latin text with translation appeared in 1857 in \"Slavische Bibliothek\" in Vienna thanks to A. V. Šembera, who worked at the time at the university as Professor of Czech Language and Literature. A year later in Prague, the fifth volume of \"Mistra Jana Husi sebrané spisy\" (\"Collected Works of Master Jan Hus\") appeared with a Czech translation and a short introduction by Václav Flajšhans, to date the latest Czech translation of this manuscript. The Latin text was published twice more: first in the unaltered Šembera edition by \"Slavische Bibliothek\" (Amsterdam, 1965) and second with a German translation and commentary by J. Schröpfer in Wiesbaden, Germany in 1968.\n\nŠembera's Latin text was probably taken directly from Palacký's copy of the manuscript; Schröpfer produced a new revised (though not flawless) edition of the manuscript. A critical evaluation comparing the preserved Třeboň manuscript with the extant excerpts has yet to appear.\n\nA manuscript of \"Orthographia bohemica\" in Jan Hus' hand has still not been found; the only complete copy of the manuscript which is available for study was written by a monk Oldřich Kříž of Třeboň (i.e. the copy found by Palacký). Its age can not be accurately determined as the copy is not dated. The end of the manuscript contains the inscription \"In die Leonardi\", i.e. on January 6; however, this may indicate either the date of completion of the original manuscript or Oldřich Kříž's copy. In the same volume as \"Orthographia bohemica\", however, are some more works: three of them bear the year 1459 and one 1457. The writings are not arranged chronologically, however, and so they serve only as an approximate guide for determining the age of the manuscript.\n\nIn addition to the Kříž manuscript there are various excerpts deposited in the archives of Prague Castle. Anežka Vidmanová's comparative study with the manuscript of Oldřich Kříž shows that the Třeboň manuscript is unreliable in many places.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "230752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230752", "title": "Paragraph", "text": "Paragraph\n\nA paragraph (from the Ancient Greek παράγραφος \"paragraphos\", \"\"to write beside\" or \"written beside\"\") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.\n\nThe oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original \"paragraphos\", similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group. The Greek \"paragraphos\" evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The hedera leaf (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the same way.\nIn ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences into paragraphs was a line break (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.\nModern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph whitespace, or put in the indentation space.\n\nA second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create \"block paragraphs.\" On a typewriter, a double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or word processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email.\n\nWidows and orphans occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last line in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.\n\nProfessionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should \"Set opening paragraphs flush left.\" Bringhurst explains as follows:\n\nThe function of a paragraph is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.\n\n\"The Elements of Typographic Style\" states that \"at least one en [space]\" should be used to indent paragraphs after the first, noting that that is the \"practical minimum\". An em space is the most commonly used paragraph indent. Miles Tinker, in his book \"Legibility of Print\", concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases readability by 7%, on the average.\n\nIn word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph.\nThis distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.\n\nHow such documents are actually stored depends on the file format. For example, HTML uses the <p> tag as a paragraph container. In plaintext files, there are two common formats. Pre-formatted text will have a newline at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line. An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.\n\nA line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a paragraph break, although this is typically not done in prose. HTML's <br /> tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the W3C recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each \"paragraph\" is a stanza), or in a street address.\n\nParagraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 \"A Course of Modern Analysis\", chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter §9.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following section §9.61 treats an associated function, following §9.62 some properties of that function, following §9.621 a related lemma, while §9.63 introduces Riemann's main theorem, and so on. Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to Giuseppe Peano on their \"Contents\" page, although this attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere.\n\nMany published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time. This extra space, especially when co-occurring at a page or section break, may contain an asterisk, three asterisks, a special stylistic dingbat, or a special symbol known as an asterism.\n\nA common English usage misconception is that a paragraph has three to five sentences; single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists often use single-sentence paragraphs.\n\nThe crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate. Forms generally vary among types of writing. For example, newspapers, scientific journals, and fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement of paragraph breaks.\n\nEnglish students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a topic sentence or \"main idea\", preferably first, and multiple \"supporting\" or \"detail\" sentences which explain or supply evidence. One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, is known as the Schaffer paragraph. For example, the following excerpt from Dr. Samuel Johnson's \"Lives of the English Poets\", the first sentence is the main idea: that Joseph Addison is a skilled \"describer of life and manners\". The succeeding sentences are details that support and explain the main idea in a specific way.\n\nThis advice differs from stock advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese (translated as \"danraku\" 段落).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "564311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564311", "title": "Parasitic gap", "text": "Parasitic gap\n\nIn the study of syntax, a parasitic gap is a construction in which one \"gap\" appears to be dependent on another \"gap\", that is, the one gap can appear only by virtue of the appearance of the other gap, hence the former is said to be \"parasitic\" on the latter, e.g. \"Which explanation did you reject __ without first really considering __?\" While parasitic gaps are present in English and some related Germanic languages, e.g. Swedish (see Engdahl 1983), their appearance is much more restricted in other, closely related languages, e.g. German and the Romance languages. An aspect of parasitic gaps that makes them particularly mysterious is the fact they usually appear inside islands to extraction. Although the study of parasitic gaps began in the late 1970s, no consensus has yet been reached about the best analysis.\n\nThe following b-sentences illustrate typical parasitic gaps. The parasitic gaps are marked with a p-subscript:\n\nThe a-sentences are normal declarative sentences that contain no gaps at all. Each b-sentence, in contrast, contains two gaps, whereby the second gap is parasitic on the first. The c-sentences illustrate that if there is no \"real\" gap (that corresponds to the wh-expression in bold), the parasitic gap is not possible. One interesting thing about parasitic gaps like the ones here in the b-sentences is their motivation. Their appearance appears to be reliant on syntactic movement (e.g. wh-movement or topicalization). The fact, however, that there are two gaps in each b-sentence but only one fronted wh-expression is a source of the difficulty associated with the construction. How does it come to pass that one fronted wh-expression is capable of licensing two gaps? Another interesting fact about parasitic gaps is that they usually appear inside extraction islands (as they do in the examples just given), hence one might expect extraction from the site of parasitic gaps to be altogether impossible. The fact that the islands are ignored is a second source of challenge associated with the phenomenon.\n\nThe phenomenon of parasitic gaps appears to have been discovered by John Robert Ross in the 1960s, but remained undiscussed until papers by Knut Tarald Taraldsen and Elisabet Engdahl explored the properties of the phenomenon in detail. The knowledge of parasitic gaps was central to the development of the GPSG framework (Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar) in the mid 1980s, this knowledge then being refined later in the HPSG framework (Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar) of Carl Pollard and Ivan Sag. In the 90s, a debate centered around the best theoretical analysis of parasitic gaps (extraction vs. percolation), this debate culminating in a collection of essays edited by Peter Culicover and Paul Postal in 2001.\n\nThe following subsections briefly explore some aspects of parasitic gaps that have been widely acknowledged in the literature on parasitism. The following areas are addressed:\n\nMany parasitic gaps appear optionally. They are in non-complementary distribution with a pronoun, meaning that the speaker has the choice whether to employ the gap or not, e.g.\n\nThe a-sentence contain typical parasitic gaps, whereas the b-sentence choose to use a pronoun instead of the gap. In other words, the parasitic gap in the a-sentences is occurring optionally. Optionality like this suggests an analysis of parasitism in terms of ellipsis, since optionality is the primary trait of known ellipsis mechanisms.\n\nWhile many parasitic gaps occur optionally as just illustrated, other parasitic gaps occur obligatorily. This can be the case when the parasitic gap precedes the \"real\" gap, e.g.\n\nThese examples illustrate a couple of important facts about parasitic gaps. The b-sentences demonstrate that the parasitic gap can indeed precede the \"real\" gap, and the strong marginality of the c-sentences shows that in a sense, the real gap can also be dependent on the parasitic gap. Note that we know that the first gap (the leftmost gap) in the b-sentences is parasitic on the following gap because it, i.e. the leftmost gap, appears inside what is normally an extraction island (marked with square brackets). The aspect of parasitic gaps illustrated with these examples is addressed in terms of the weak crossover phenomenon (WCO). The WCO phenomenon occurs when a fronted expression is coreferential with an intermediate expression that appears between the fronted expression and the position of its gap. In the big picture, one can simply note that parasitic gaps behave variable depending upon whether they precede or follow the \"real\" gap. When they precede the \"real\" gap, their appearance is usually obligatory.\n\nMuch work on parasitism assumes that parasitic gaps are dependent on another gap, the \"real\" gap in the examples above. Hence the assumption is that parasitic gaps are reliant on those mechanisms that license normal extraction gaps, e.g. wh-movement and topicalization. This assumption is challenged, however, by so-called missing-object constructions (also known as \"tough\"-constructions), e.g.\n\nThe a-sentences lack gaps entirely. The b-sentences contain parasitic gaps despite the fact that neither wh-movement nor topicalization has occurred. The b-sentences illustrate missing-object constructions, since the verbs \"appreciate\", \"understand\", and \"get\" are transitive and should hence take an object. This object is missing, as marked by the gap on the left. Whatever the analysis of parasitic gaps ends up being in the long run, it will have to accommodate the facts involving missing objects illustrated here. Movement (wh-movement, topicalization) may actually not be the key factor licensing parasitic gaps.\n\nExamining the examples of optional parasitic gaps produced above so far, one sees that in each case, a certain parallelism is present. This parallelism is now illustrated using brackets:\n\nIn each of these examples, the square brackets mark what appear to be parallel structures, as associated with the coordinate structures of coordination. The brackets mark verb phrases (VPs), whereby the subordinator appearing between the brackets is functioning like a coordinator (i.e. \"and\", \"or\", or \"but\"). This parallelism may be a significant factor that is aiding the appearance of the parasitic gaps. When this parallelism is absent, there is a significant drop in acceptability of the parasitic gap:\n\nThese instances of parasitic gaps are all marginal to varying degrees. The marginality is probably due to the lack of syntactic parallelism indicated by the brackets, the gaps no longer appearing on the same side of the brackets. In any case, there is a noticeable drop in acceptability when the parallelism in the examples further above is removed. What exactly explains this drop in acceptability is not entirely clear, although it may have to do with ease of processing. Parallel structures are easier for humans to process, and hence parasitic gaps are reliant on a low processing load.\n\nThe theoretical analysis of parasitic gaps is not a settled matter by any means, since accounts of the phenomenon vary drastically. In very broad terms, there are two lines of analysis that one can pursue. The first is to assume that parasitic gaps are extraction gaps (\"the extraction analysis\"); parasitic gaps arise by way of the same basic mechanism that licenses \"normal\" extraction gaps. This sort of approach must augment the analysis of extraction gaps in some way in order to accommodate parasitic gaps under the same theoretical umbrella. The alternative approach rejects the analysis that takes parasitic gaps to be extraction gaps. One assumes instead that parasitic gaps actually contain a covert element, this element having the status of definite proform. (\"the proform analysis\"). Some analyses mix and match these two basic lines of analysis, although in general, both are well represented in the literature on parasitism and most accounts can be placed in the one or the other camp.\n\nExtraction analyses have the advantage that they immediately accommodate the simple observation that most parasitic gaps appear to be dependent on the occurrence of wh-movement or topicalization. Extraction analyses are challenged, however, by missing-object constructions, as noted above. Proform analyses have the advantage that they immediately accommodate the simple observation that many parasitic gaps occur optionally; the covert proform has the option to be overt. The proform analyses are challenged, however, by the fact that most parasitic gaps occur in the immediate environment of wh-movement or topicalization, since they do not provide a clear basis for explaining this correlation.\n\n"}
{"id": "113248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113248", "title": "Pashto", "text": "Pashto\n\nPashto (, , \"Pax̌tō\" ), sometimes spelled Pukhto, is the language of the Pashtuns. It is known in Persian literature as Afghāni () and in Urdu and Hindi literature as Paṭhānī. Speakers of the language are called Pashtuns or Pakhtuns and sometimes Afghans or Pathans. It is an Eastern Iranian language, belonging to the Indo-European family. Pashto is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan, and it is the second-largest regional language of Pakistan, mainly spoken in the west and northwest of the country. In Pakistan, it is the majority language of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the northern districts of Balochistan. Along with Dari Persian, Pashto is the main language among the Pashtun diaspora around the world. The total number of Pashto-speakers is estimated to be 45–60 million people worldwide.\n\nPashto belongs to the Northeastern Iranian group of the Indo-Iranian branch, but \"Ethnologue\" lists it as Southeastern Iranian. Pashto has two main dialect groups, \"soft\" and \"hard\", the latter locally known as \"Pakhto\" or \"Paxto\".\n\nAs a national language of Afghanistan, Pashto is primarily spoken in the east, south, and southwest, but also in some northern and western parts of the country. The exact number of speaker is unavailable, but different estimates show that Pashto is the mother tongue of 45–60% of the total population of Afghanistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, around 38 million people speak Pashto, according to the 2017 census, which is over 15% of Pakistan's population. Most of these people are in the northwestern areas of the country, comprising Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern Balochistan. There are also many Pashtun speakers in the major cities of Pakistan.\n\nOther communities of Pashto speakers are found in Tajikistan, and further in the Pashtun diaspora. There are also communities of part Pashtun descent in India, including Bollywood families and Indian Film Cinema such as Khans. They are integrated into Indian languages, hold mixed races, ethnicities, religions and culture and do not hold cultural reverence to the ethnicity or their origins. Pashtuns are of ancient Iranian origin and lived in Afghanistan years before other ethnic groups in Afghanistan.\n\nIn addition, sizable Pashto-speaking communities also exist in the Middle East, especially in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, northeastern Iran (primarily in South Khorasan Province to the east of Qaen, near the Afghan border). The Pashtun diaspora speaks Pashto in countries like the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Qatar, Australia, Japan, Russia, New Zealand, etc.\n\nPashto is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan, along with Dari. Since the early 18th century, the monarchs of Afghanistan have been ethnic Pashtuns (except for Habibullāh Kalakāni in 1929). Persian, the literary language of the royal court, was more widely used in government institutions while the Pashtun tribes spoke Pashto as their native tongue. King Amanullah Khan began promoting Pashto during his reign (1926-1929) as a marker of ethnic identity and as a symbol of \"official nationalism\" leading Afghanistan to independence after the defeat of the British Empire in the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919. In the 1930s a movement began to take hold to promote Pashto as a language of government, administration and art with the establishment of a Pashto Society \"Pashto Anjuman\" in 1931 and the inauguration of the Kabul University in 1932 as well as the formation of the Pashto Academy \"Pashto Tolana\" in 1937. Although officially supporting the use of Pashto, the Afghan elite regarded Persian as a “sophisticated language and a symbol of cultured upbringing”. King Zahir Shah (reigned 1933-1973) thus followed suit after his father Nadir Khan had decreed in 1933 that officials were to study and utilize both Persian and Pashto. In 1936 a royal decree of Zahir Shah formally granted to Pashto the status of an official language with full rights to usage in all aspects of government and education - despite the fact that the ethnically Pashtun royal family and bureaucrats mostly spoke Persian. Thus Pashto became a national language, a symbol for Afghan nationalism.\n\nThe constitutional assembly reaffirmed the status of Pashto as an official language in 1964 when Afghan Persian was officially renamed to Dari.\nThe lyrics of the national anthem of Afghanistan are in Pashto.\n\nIn Pakistan, Pashto is spoken as a first language by about 35-40 million people – 15.42% of Pakistan's 208 million population. It is the main language of the Pashtun-majority regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern Balochistan. It is also spoken in parts of Mianwali and Attock districts of the Punjab province and in Islamabad, as well as by Pashtuns who live in different cities throughout the country. Modern Pashto-speaking communities are found in the cities of Karachi and Hyderabad in Sindh.\n\nUrdu and English are the two official languages of Pakistan. Pashto has no official status at the federal level. On a provincial level, Pashto is the regional language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern Balochistan. The primary medium of education in government schools in Pakistan is Urdu, but from 2014 onwards, the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has placed more emphasis on English as the medium of instruction. English-medium private schools in Pashto-speaking areas, however, generally do not use Pashto. The imposition of Urdu as the primary medium of education in public schools has caused a systematic degradation and decline of many of Pakistan's native languages including Pashto. This has caused growing resentment amongst Pashtuns, who also complain that Pashto is often neglected officially.\n\nAccording to 19th-century linguist James Darmesteter and modern linguist Michael M. T. Henderson, Pashto is \"descended from Avestan\". The Rabatak inscription of Emperor Kanishka written in Bactrian and Greek contains words are borrowed from Pashto language due to their proximity to the modern Pashto language.\n\nStrabo, who lived between 64 BC and 24 CE, explains that the tribes inhabiting the lands west of the Indus River were part of Ariana and to their east was India. Since the 3rd century CE and onward, they are mostly referred to by the name \"Afghan\" (\"Abgan\") and their language as \"Afghani\".\n\nScholars such as Abdul Hai Habibi and others believe that the earliest modern Pashto work dates back to Amir Kror Suri of the early Ghurid period in the eighth century, and they use the writings found in Pata Khazana. However, this is disputed by several modern experts such as David Neil MacKenzie and Lucia Serena Loi. Pata Khazana is a Pashto manuscript claimed to be written by Mohammad Hotak under the patronage of the Pashtun emperor Hussain Hotak in Kandahar. Pata Khazana claims to contain an anthology of Pashto poets from the early Ghurid period up to the Hotak period in the eighteenth century.\n\nFrom the 16th century, Pashto poetry become very popular among the Pashtuns. Some of those who wrote in Pashto are Bayazid Pir Roshan (a major inventor of the Pashto alphabet), Khushal Khan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Nazo Tokhi, and Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the modern state of Afghanistan or the Durrani Empire.\n\nIn modern times, noticing the incursion of Persian and Arabic vocabulary, there is a strong desire to \"purify\" Pashto by restoring its old vocabulary.\n\nPashto is a subject–object–verb (SOV) language with split ergativity. Adjectives come before nouns. Nouns and adjectives are inflected for two genders (masc./fem.), two numbers (sing./plur.), and four cases (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There is also an inflection for the subjunctive mood. The verb system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as Prakrit and Bactrian. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object, therefore Pashto shows a partly ergative behaviour. Like Kurdish, but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of adpositions – prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions.\n\nPhonemes that have been borrowed, thus non-native to Pashto, are colour-coded. The phonemes tend to be replaced by , .\n\nThe retroflex lateral flap ( or ) is pronounced as retroflex approximant when final.\n\nThe retroflex fricatives and palatal fricatives represent dialectally different pronunciations of the same sound, not separate phonemes. In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of Kandahar), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the postalveolar fricatives , while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the velar phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as (not ). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983), the west-central voiced palatal fricative actually occurs only in the Wardak Province, and is merged into elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe velars followed by the close back rounded vowel assimilate into the labialized velars .\n\nVoiceless stops are all unaspirated, like Spanish, other Romance languages, and Austronesian languages; they have slightly aspirated allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable.\n\nIn Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other Eastern Iranian languages. However, a remarkably large number of words are unique to Pashto. Post-7th century borrowings came primarily from the Persian and Hindustani languages, with some Arabic words being borrowed through those two languages, but sometimes directly. Modern speech borrows words from English, French and German.\n\nHere is an exemplary list of Pure Pashto and borrowings:\n\nPashto employs the Pashto alphabet, a modified form of the Perso-Arabic or Arabic script. In the 16th century, Bayazid Pir Roshan introduced 13 new letters to the Pashto alphabet. The alphabet was further modified over the years.\n\nThe Pashto alphabet consists of 45 letters and 4 diacritic marks. The following table gives the letters' isolated forms, along with the Latin equivalents and typical IPA values:\n\nPashto dialects are divided into two varieties, the “soft” southern variety \"Paṣ̌tō\", and the “hard” northern variety \"Pax̌tō\" (Pakhtu). Each variety is further divided into a number of dialects. The southern dialect of Wanetsi is the most distinctive Pashto dialect.\n\n1. Southern variety\n\n2. Northern variety\n\nPashto-speakers have long had a tradition of oral literature, including proverbs, stories, and poems. Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1689), who, along with Rahman Baba (1650–1715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. Both of these poets belonged to the modern day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan). From the time of Ahmad Shah Durrani (1722–1772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of \"Maʿrifat al-Afghānī\" (\"The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]\"). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto verbs was written in 1805 in India under the title of \"Riyāż al-Maḥabbah\" (\"Training in Affection\") through the patronage of Nawab Mohabat Khan, son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, chief of the Barech. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled \"ʿAjāyib al-Lughāt\" (\"Wonders of Languages\").\n\nAn excerpt from the \"Kalām\" of Rahman Baba:\n\nIPA: \"Zə ra.mɑn pə xpəl.a gram jəm t͡ʃe ma.jən jəm\"\n\"t͡ʃe d̪ɑ nor ʈo.pan me bo.li gram pə t͡sə\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Zə Rahmān pə xpəla gram yəm če mayən yəm\"\n\"Če dā nor ṭopan me boli gram pə tsə\"\n\nTranslation: \"I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,\nOn what does this other universe call me guilty.\"\n\nPashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto \"matalūna\", sg. \"matal\").

Gramsci coined the term to refer to a significant change that is not a rupturous one, but a slow and gradual metamorphosis which could take years or generations to accomplish. \n\nGramsci uses \"passive revolution\" in a variety of contexts with slightly different meanings. The primary usage is to contrast the passive transformation of bourgeois society in nineteenth-century Italy with the active revolutionary process of the bourgeoisie in France. However, Gramsci also associates Italian fascism with the notion of passive revolution. \n\nPassive revolution is a transformation of the political and institutional structures without strong social processes. Also he uses the term for the mutations of the structures of capitalist economic production that he recognizes primarily in the development of the U.S. factory system of the 1920s and 1930s. \n\nBut besides this usage of the term \"passive revolution\" as a descriptive tool of historical analysis, Gramsci seems to employ it like a suggestion as path for struggle. In a society subsumed within capital, the only way Gramsci can see to make a revolution is a relatively \"passive\" one through the institutions of civil society.\n\nGramsci outlines several main tactics to carry out a passive revolution. These tactics all worked in tandem to gradually and organically change a society in such a way that met the demands of the ruling class. This is the concept of \"organic change\", change that appears to be self-starting and natural in the evolution of a society. Gramsci analyzed movements such as reformism and fascism, as well as the 'scientific management' and assembly line methods of Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford respectively as examples of passive revolution initiated by the bourgeoisie.\n\nGramsci theorized that to transform a society, one had to be in firm control of the minds of children, as their world view has yet to be formed. Thus, he supported mandatory nationalized education, so that every child would learn and adopt the values, morals, and world views that they were taught. This ensures that future generations will have a thought background in the revolutionary principles, ethos, and logos. As well as giving the controlling party the ability to address the next generation directly, thus bypassing the discerning filter of the individual's parents.\n\nGramsci’s theories revolved around the idea of creating a new cultural hegemony in society. One key aspect of how the new hegemony was to come into being was the control of language. By controlling, and influencing the language of a society, the new hegemon could control how society speaks, and thus eventually how they begin to think. This largely begins in the schools, but must be repeated in many outlets of society. When one controls the way in which language is used, it can serve to influence how people think about any number of topics, based on what is socially permittable to say or not say.\n\nGramsci looked at the Roman Catholic Church as a powerful force in Italian society, and was amazed by its ability to influence the hearts and minds of men. As a result, the Catholic Church became a rival hegemon in his theoretical passive revolution. Thus, Gramsci theorized that the Church had to be silenced as a rival hegemon in society. This could be eventually done by force, but a more successful strategy would be to infiltrate it with the revolutionary sense of morals, ethics, and logic. This could not be an active measure, but a gradual shift, as the other tactics of revolution are implemented. Control or infiltration of religion would be of crucial importance. Religion must echo the \"organic change\" in society; it must serve to assist the new hegemony. Religion is an excellent means to this end because, by its very nature, people are willing to believe what comes from the pulpit, as being objectively good.\n\nThe media is the lynchpin in Gramsci’s model. The media must be used smartly to repeat organically, edify, and buttress the revolutionary values and morals that are being disseminated throughout society (through education, language, and religion). The media ties together Gramsci’s other tactics, and fills any gaps that they might leave. It must echo revolutionary morals, and further the social views of language, education, religion, and societal values. The media has a great control over the opinions of people, and this must be utilized, and not be allowed to influence in contrast to the revolution.\n\n\n"}
