Afghans \"use proverbs in their daily conversations far more than Westerners do, and with greater effect\" (Edward Zellem 2012b: i).\n\nThe most extensive proverb collections in Afghan languages are in Dari and Pashto, the two largest languages in Afghanistan. The Dari language is very similar to Persian spoken in Iran and Tajik spoken in nearby Tajikistan. A broader, more contextualized, study of Afghan proverbs would include comparisons of Afghan proverbs with (for which several volumes are available in English) and with Tajik proverbs (e.g. comparing with those in Bell 2009) from Tajikistan.\nSo far, collections of proverbs in Afghan languages are available in English translation for at least four Afghan languages: Dari, Pashto, Pashai, and Balochi.\n\nDari: For Dari, there are two main published collections of proverbs, with some overlap between them. The earlier is J. Christy Wilson's collection of 100 (2002), \"One Hundred Afghan Persian Proverbs\", the list having been reproduced (without credit) in other sources. The most recent main collection of Dari proverbs is the 3rd edition of U.S. Navy Captain Edward Zellem's collection, built on the 151 of the 2012 edition, plus 50 more that were submitted via the Web. The 2012 edition won a 2013 award from the Military Writer's Society of America. From the 151 proverbs of the 2012 edition, 38 were chosen for an edition with color illustrations, intended for language learning by a more popular audience (Zellem 2012a). This edition's format has been published with translations into a number of languages, including English, Russian (Zellem 2013a), German (Zellem 2013b), French (2013c), and Finnish. There are reports that \"Zarbolmathalhâ\", a collection of 1,152 Dari proverbs collected by Mowlânâ Khâl Mohammad Khaste, was published in 1983 (Kreyenbroek 2010:317). There is also a collection of Dari proverbs with German translations by Noor Nazrabi, \"Afghanische Redensarten und Volksweisheiten\".\n\nPashto: For Pashto, one of the two main languages of Afghanistan, the newest available source is the collection of 151 proverbs by Zellem. A larger collection of Pashto proverbs of 1,350 proverbs is by Bartlotti and Khattak (2006), a revised and expanded version of an earlier work by Tair and Edwards (1982). Enevoldsen published 100 proverbs and 100 \"tapas\" folk poems (1967). An earlier collection was published by Benawa (1979). An older source containing 406 Pashto proverbs is Thorburn's (1876), where he includes them in his book on pp. 231–473. Another out-of-print collection is Boyle's \"\"Naqluna\": Some Pushtu Proverbs and Sayings\" from 1926. The most recent published collection of Pashto proverbs contains 151 proverbs submitted by Pashto speakers via the Web and Twitter (Zellem 2014). There are reports that Nuri published a selection of proverbs from \"Paśto Toləna\" in 1910 (Kreyenbroek 2010:151). There are about 50 pages of Pashto proverbs arranged by topic in a doctoral dissertation by Bartlotti. Three additional volumes on Pashto proverbs have also been published in Pakistan, the first by M.M.K. Shinwari, \"Da mataluno qisay\" (stories of proverbs) in 1999. There are two additional volumes printed in Pakistan, both by M. A. Lashkar, \"Oulasi mataluna\" (Popular proverbs) in 2005 and \"Da mataluno qisay: Ter pa her baqi rozgar\" (Stories of proverbs: Old forgotten new adopted) in 2009. There is also a collection of proverbs prepared by Boyle in 1926.\n\nPashai: Pashai is a less known language community living east of Kabul. A local committee working with Yun produced a collection of 171 proverbs (2010), each one translated into English, Korean, and Pashto. Lehr has analyzed an aspect of the grammar of proverb use.\n\nBalochi: For Balochi, a language spoken on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghan border, Badalkan gives a number of Balochi proverbs translated into English in his article, focusing on proverbs that are related to specific stories (2000). He also cites several published collections of Balochi proverbs, all published in Balochi. Six proverbs are given on the last pages (203, 204) of Dames' 1907 \"Popular poetry of the Baloches\".\n\nIn addition to these publications in English, there are items about proverbs in languages spoken in Afghanistan published in other languages. These include:\n\nProverbs are often shared across languages when there is significant interaction among peoples. Some examples of shared proverbs among the languages of Afghanistan include:\n\nThe proverbs of Afghanistan are not fixed, archaic expressions. For example, there is a traditional proverb in Pashto (Bartlotti and Khattak 2006: 264) and Dari (Wilson 2002:32), \"The wound of the sword will heal, but not that of the tongue.\" The Pashai form of this proverb reflects a more modern form of weapon, \"A bad wound by a gun will be cured, but the wound by a bad word won’t be cured\" (Yun 2010:159). Another example of an updated proverb is today's Pashai proverb \"An unloaded gun makes two people afraid\" compared with a Pashto proverb published in 1876 reflecting an older form of military technology \"Of the broken bow two persons are in fear\" (1876:408).\n\nNot surprisingly, proverbs in all four of the languages documented have proverbs that mention nouns common in Afghanistan, such as \"camels\", \"mountains\", and \"poverty\".\n\nIt is not surprising to find proverbs that reflect Afghanistan's Islamic traditions, such as \n\nA common element among the proverb traditions of Afghanistan is that some proverbs are linked to stories (though this is not unique to Afghanistan). Proverbs that trace their origin to stories are found in Pashto (Thorburn 1876: 314), Dari (Zellem 2012b:153), and Balochi (Badalkhan 2000).\n\nFor most Afghan languages, the first challenge is to collect proverbs before analysis can be done. For Pashto, which has the oldest and largest collections of proverbs, there have been two dissertations that analyzed the links between their proverbs and culture. (Though both projects were done with Pashto speakers on the Pakistan side of the border, the findings are expected to apply on the Afghan side of the borders, as well.) The first was about '\"pashtunwali\" or \"pakhto\", \"the way of the Pashtuns\", ... a code of honour embracing the customary law, morality, ethos and notion of ancestral heritage associated with \"being Pashtun\" and \"doing pakhto\" '. The second dissertation 'argues that Pashto proverbs encode and promote a patriarchal view and sexist ideology.' Gender identities and roles as expressed in Pashto proverbs are also described in an article-length presentation. Additionally, there is an article about the status of women as seen through Pakhtun proverbs.\n\nKohistani has written a thesis to show how understanding Afghan Dari proverbs will help Europeans understand Afghan culture.\n\nThe use of proverbs and other artistic language in talking about war and instability in Afghanistan is the subject of a study by Margaret Mills.\n\n"}

{"id": "6520028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6520028", "title": "Attempto Controlled English", "text": "Attempto Controlled English\n\nAttempto Controlled English (ACE) is a controlled natural language, i.e. a subset of standard English with a restricted syntax and restricted semantics described by a small set of construction and interpretation rules. It has been under development at the University of Zurich since 1995. In 2013, ACE version 6.7 was announced.\n\nACE can serve as knowledge representation, specification, and query language, and is intended for professionals who want to use formal notations and formal methods, but may not be familiar with them. Though ACE appears perfectly natural – it can be read and understood by any speaker of English – it is in fact a formal language.\n\nACE and its related tools have been used in the fields of software specifications, theorem proving, text summaries, ontologies, rules, querying, medical documentation and planning.\n\nHere are some simple examples:\n\n\nACE construction rules require that each noun be introduced by a determiner (\"a\", \"every\", \"no\", \"some\", \"at least 5\", ...). ACE interpretation rules decide that (1) is interpreted as universally quantified, while (2) is interpreted as existentially quantified. Sentences like \"Women are human\" do not follow ACE syntax and are consequently not valid.\n\nInterpretation rules resolve the anaphoric references in (3): \"the tie\" and \"it\" of the second sentence refer to \"a new tie\" of the first sentence, while \"his\" and \"the man\" of the second sentence refer to \"a man\" of the first sentence. Thus an ACE text is a coherent entity of anaphorically linked sentences.\n\nThe Attempto Parsing Engine (APE) translates ACE texts unambiguously into discourse representation structures (DRS) that use a variant of the language of first-order logic. A DRS can be further translated into other formal languages, for instance AceRules with various semantics, OWL, and SWRL. Translating an ACE text into (a fragment of) first-order logic allows users to reason about the text, for instance to verify, to validate, and to query it.\n\nAs an overview of the current version 6.6 of ACE this section:\n\n\nThe vocabulary of ACE comprises:\n\n\nThe grammar of ACE defines and constrains the form and the meaning of ACE sentences and texts. ACE's grammar is expressed as a set of construction rules. The meaning of sentences is described as a small set of interpretation rules. A Troubleshooting Guide describes how to use ACE and how to avoid pitfalls.\n\nAn ACE text is a sequence of declarative sentences that can be anaphorically interrelated. Furthermore, ACE supports questions and commands.\n\nA simple sentence asserts that something is the case — a fact, an event, a state.\n\nSimple ACE sentences have the following general structure:\n\nEvery sentence has a subject and a verb. Complements (direct and indirect objects) are necessary for transitive verbs (\"insert something\") and ditransitive verbs (\"give something to somebody\"), whereas adjuncts (adverbs, prepositional phrases) are optional.\n\nAll elements of a simple sentence can be elaborated upon to describe the situation in more detail. To further specify the nouns \"customer\" and \"card\", we could add adjectives:\n\npossessive nouns and \"of\"-prepositional phrases:\n\nor variables as appositions:\n\nOther modifications of nouns are possible through relative sentences:\n\nwhich are described below since they make a sentence composite. We can also detail the insertion event, e.g. by adding an adverb:\n\nor, equivalently:\n\nor, by adding prepositional phrases:\n\nWe can combine all of these elaborations to arrive at:\n\nComposite sentences are recursively built from simpler sentences through coordination, subordination, quantification, and negation. Note that ACE composite sentences overlap with what linguists call compound sentences and complex sentences.\n\nCoordination by \"and\" is possible between sentences and between phrases of the same syntactic type.\n\nNote that the coordination of the noun phrases \"a card\" and \"a code\" represents a plural object.\n\nCoordination by \"or\" is possible between sentences, verb phrases, and relative clauses.\n\nCoordination by \"and\" and \"or\" is governed by the standard binding order of logic, i.e. \"and\" binds stronger than \"or\". Commas can be used to override the standard binding order. Thus the sentence:\n\nmeans that the customer inserts a VisaCard and a code, or alternatively a MasterCard and a code.\n\nThere are four constructs of subordination: relative sentences, \"if-then\" sentences, modality, and sentence subordination.\n\nRelative sentences starting with \"who\", \"which\", and \"that\" allow to add detail to nouns:\n\nWith the help of \"if-then\" sentences we can specify conditional or hypothetical situations:\n\nNote the anaphoric reference via the pronoun \"it\" in the \"then\"-part to the noun phrase \"a card\" in the \"if\"-part.\n\nModality allows us to express possibility and necessity:\n\nSentence subordination comes in various forms:\n\nQuantification allows us to speak about all objects of a certain class (universal quantification), or to denote explicitly the existence of at least one object of this class (existential quantification). The textual occurrence of a universal or existential quantifier opens its scope that extends to the end of the sentence, or in coordinations to the end of the respective coordinated sentence.\n\nTo express that all involved customers insert cards we can write\n\nThis sentence means that each customer inserts a card that may, or may not, be the same as the one inserted by another customer. To specify that all customers insert the same card — however unrealistic that situation seems — we can write:\n\nor, equivalently:\n\nTo state that every card is inserted by a customer we write:\n\nor, somewhat indirectly:\n\nNegation allows us to express that something is not the case:\n\nTo negate something for all objects of a certain class one uses \"no\":\n\nor, \"there is no\":\n\nTo negate a complete statement one uses sentence negation:\n\nThese forms of negation are logical negations, i.e. they state that something is provably not the case. Negation as failure states that a state of affairs cannot be proved, i.e. there is no information whether the state of affairs is the case or not.\n\nACE supports two forms of queries: \"yes/no\"-queries and \"wh\"-queries.\n\n\"Yes/no\"-queries ask for the existence or non-existence of a specified situation. If we specified:\n\nthen we can ask:\n\nto get a positive answer. Note that interrogative sentences always end with a question mark.\n\nWith the help of \"wh\"-queries, i.e. queries with query words, we can interrogate a text for details of the specified situation. If we specified:\n\nwe can ask for each element of the sentence with the exception of the verb.\n\nQueries can also be constructed by a sequence of declarative sentences followed by one interrogative sentence, for example:\n\nACE also supports commands. Some examples:\n\nA command always consists of a noun phrase (the addressee), followed by a comma, followed by an uncoordinated verb phrase. Furthermore, a command has to end with an exclamation mark.\n\nTo constrain the ambiguity of full natural language ACE employs three simple means:\n\n\nIn natural language, relative sentences combined with coordinations can introduce ambiguity:\n\nIn ACE the sentence has the unequivocal meaning that the customer opens an account, as reflected by the paraphrase:\n\nTo express the alternative — though not very realistic — meaning that the card opens an account, the relative pronoun \"that\" must be repeated, thus yielding a coordination of relative sentences:\n\nThis sentence is unambiguously equivalent in meaning to the paraphrase:\n\nNot all ambiguities can be safely removed from ACE without rendering it artificial. To deterministically interpret otherwise syntactically correct ACE sentences we use a small set of interpretation rules. For example, if we write:\n\nthen \"with a code\" attaches to the verb \"inserts\", but not to \"a card\". However, this is probably not what we meant to say. To express that \"the code\" is associated with \"the card\" we can employ the interpretation rule that a relative sentence always modifies the immediately preceding noun phrase, and rephrase the input as:\n\nyielding the paraphrase:\n\nor — to specify that the customer inserts a card and a code — as:\n\nUsually ACE texts consist of more than one sentence:\n\nTo express that all occurrences of card and code should mean the same card and the same code, ACE provides anaphoric references via the definite article:\n\nDuring the processing of the ACE text, all anaphoric references are replaced by the most recent and most specific accessible noun phrase that agrees in gender and number. As an example of \"most recent and most specific\", suppose an ACE parser is given the sentence:\n\nThen:\n\nrefers to the second card, while:\n\nrefers to the first card.\n\nNoun phrases within \"if-then\" sentences, universally quantified sentences, negations, modality, and subordinated sentences cannot be referred to anaphorically from subsequent sentences, i.e. such noun phrases are not \"accessible\" from the following text. Thus for each of the sentences:\n\nwe cannot refer to \"a card\" with:\n\nAnaphoric references are also possible via personal pronouns:\n\nor via variables:\n\nAnaphoric references via definite articles and variables can be combined:\n\nNote that proper names like \"SimpleMat\" always refer to the same object.\n\n\n"}

Most Balinese speakers also know Indonesian. Balinese itself is not mutually intelligible with Indonesian but may be understood by Javanese speakers after some exposure.\n\nIn 2011, the Bali Cultural Agency estimated that the number of people still using the Balinese language in their daily lives on the Bali Island does not exceed 1 million, as in urban areas their parents only introduce the Indonesian language or even English, while daily conversations in the institutions and the mass media have disappeared. The written form of the Balinese language is increasingly unfamiliar, and most Balinese people use the Balinese language only as a means of oral communication, often mixing it with Indonesian in their daily speech. But in the transmigration areas outside Bali Island, the Balinese language is extensively used and believed to play an important role in the survival of the language.\n\nThe higher registers of the language borrow extensively from Javanese: an old form of classical Javanese, Kawi, is used in Bali as a religious and ceremonial language.\n\nThe official spelling denotes both and by \"a\". However, \"a\" is usually pronounced when it ends a word, and occurs also in prefixes \"ma-\", \"pa-\" and \"da-\".\n\nStress falls on the last syllable.\n\nThe word order is similar to that of Indonesian, and verb and noun inflectional morphology is similarly minimal. However, derivational morphology is extensive, and suffixes are applied to indicate definite or indefinite articles, and optionally to indicate possession.\n\nBalinese has different registers depending on the relationship and status of those speaking: low (\"basa ketah\"), middle (\"basa madia\"), and high (\"basa singgih\"). \"Basa singgih\" contains many loanwords from Sanskrit and Javanese.\n\nBalinese has a decimal numeral system, but this is complicated by numerous words for intermediate quantities such as 45, 175, and 1600.\n\nBalinese has been written in two different writing systems: the Balinese script, and in modern times the Latin script.\n\nThe Balinese script (\"Aksara Bali\", ), which is arranged as \"Hanacaraka\" (), is an abugida, ultimately derived from the Brāhmī script of India. The earliest known inscriptions date from the 11th century AD.\n\nFew people today are familiar with the Balinese script. The Balinese Script is almost the same as Javanese script.\n\nSchools in Bali today teach a Latin alphabet known as \"Tulisan Bali\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46701", "title": "Bodily harm", "text": "Bodily harm\n\nBodily harm is a legal term of art used in the definition of both statutory and common law offences in Australia, Canada, England and Wales and other common law jurisdictions. It is a synonym for injury or bodily injury and similar expressions, though it may be used with a precise and limited meaning in any given jurisdiction. The expression grievous bodily harm first appeared in a statute in Lord Ellenborough's Act (1803).\n\nIn the Canadian Criminal Code, \"bodily harm\" is defined as \"any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature.\"\n\nThe expression is not defined by any statute. It currently appears in a number of offences under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (ss. 18, 20, 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 35, and 47) and in the offence of burglary under the Theft Act 1968 (s. 9). It is also used in the definition of murder (as it appears in case law) in the guise of grievous bodily harm.\n\nPsychiatric disorder\n\nNon-physical or \"psychiatric injury\" can be considered \"bodily harm\" whether \"actual\" or \"grievous\", but there must be formal medical evidence to verify the injury.\n\nIn R v Ireland, R v Burstow, Lord Steyn said:\n\nIn modern times, the practice of statutory interpretation frequently refers to the actual intention of the draftsman as expressed in the words of the Act, but considered in the light of contemporary knowledge. \"R v. Chan Fook\" applied this approach. Hobhouse LJ. said the prosecution \"chose to introduce into the case an allegation that even if Mr Martins had suffered no physical injury at all as a result of the assault upon him by the Appellant, he had nevertheless been reduced to a mental state which in itself, without more, amounted to actual bodily harm. The only evidence to which the prosecution could point in support of this allegation was the evidence of Mr Martins that he felt abused and humiliated, that he had been threatened with further violence, and that he was very frightened. There was no medical or psychiatric evidence to support the allegation. There was no evidence that he was in a state of shock at any time prior to receiving the injuries which he suffered as a result of falling from the window.\"\n\nHobhouse LJ. said:\n\nHe went on to say:\n\nHe said that juries \"should not be directed that an assault which causes a hysterical and nervous condition is an assault occasioning actual bodily harm\".\n\nThis was followed by the Court of Appeal in R v Constanza, and the House of Lords which confirmed the principle in \"R v Burstow\", \"R v Ireland\". Ireland caused three women to suffer psychiatric illness. Burstow's victim was fearful of personal violence and was diagnosed as suffering from a severe depressive illness. The best medical practice today accepts a link between the body and psychiatric injury, so the words \"bodily harm\" in sections 20 and 47 were capable of covering recognised psychiatric illnesses, such as an anxiety disorders or a depressive disorder, which affect the central nervous system of the body. However, to qualify, those neuroses must be more than simple states of fear, or problems in coping with everyday life, which do not amount to psychiatric illnesses.\n\nVenereal and other communicable disease\n\nSee R v. Dica [2004] EWCA Crim 1103\n\nThe Law Commission stated its view that \"the deliberate or reckless causing of disease should not be beyond the reach of the criminal law\" and there is continuing debate over whether the transmission of HIV is covered as grievous bodily harm or under sections 22 to 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\n\nIn R v Clarence, it appeared that at a time when the prisoner knew, but his wife did not know, that he was suffering from gonorhoea, he had \"connection\" with her; that the result was that the disease was communicated to her, and that had she been aware of the prisoner's condition she would not have submitted to the intercourse.\n\nLord Coleridge CJ., Pollock and Huddleston BB., Stephen, Manisty, Mathew, A L Smith, Wills and Grantham JJ., held that the conduct of the prisoner did not amount to an offence under either section 20 or section 47. Field, Hawkins, Day and Charles JJ. dissented.\n\nWills J. said \"the facts are ... that he infected her, and that from such infection she suffered grievous bodily harm\".\n\nHawkins J. said:\n\nField J. said (a footnote has been included in the body of the text, indicated by \"(1)\"):\n\nUnconsciousness\n\nSee T v.

Definiteness is not marked (even though many loanwords from Arabic contain what was originally the Arabic definite article). Normally plurals end in /-n/, singular masculines have the prefix /a-/ and plurals /i-/, and feminines have the circumfix in singular and in plural. In Ayt Seghrouchen initial /a/ is dropped in many singular nouns, though their plurals and construct states are similar to Ayt Ayache.\n\nPlurals may either involve a regular change (\"sound plurals\"), internal vowel change (\"broken plurals\"), or a combination of the two. Some plurals are mixed, e.g. ('hand') > ('hands').\n\nNative masculine singular nouns usually start with in singular and in plural, and \"sound plurals\" (as opposed to \"broken plurals\" which also take the suffix in plural).

The construct state is formed as follows:\n\n\nExamples (in AA):\n\nTamazight's use of possessive suffixes mirrors that of many other Afroasiatic languages.\n\nAyt Seghrouchen also has a special set of suffixes for future transitive verbs (which combine with the future marker ):\n\nIndependent possessives are formed by attaching the possessive suffixes to (if the object possessed is masculine) or ' (for feminine), e.g. ('mine').\n\nSpecial possessive suffixes are used with kinship terms.\n\nEmphatics are formed with the word , e.g. ('I myself').\n\nWhen / / is suffixed to a noun ending in or epenthetic is inserted, e.g. ('this pack-saddle').\n\nOther deictic suffixes: ('this'), ('that'), e.g. ('this house'), ('that house').\n\nVerbs are marked for tense, aspect, mode, voice, and polarity, and agree with the number, person, and gender of the subject.\n\nVerb framing\n\nSatellite framing is accomplished with the proximate affix /d/ (/dː/ in AS) and remote /nː/, e.g. /dːu/ 'to go' yields /i-dːa/ 'he went', /i-dːa-d/ 'he came', /i-dːa-nː/ 'he went there' (in AS the verb /rˠaħ/ 'to go' is used instead)\n\nVoice\n\nDerived verb stems may be made from basic verb stems to create causatives, reciprocals, recipro-causatives, passives, or habituals.\n\nCausatives are derived from unaugmented stems with the prefix /s(ː)-/.\n\nHabituals are derived from unaugmented and reciprocal/recipro-causative stems with the prefix /tː-/ (sometimes with internal change), from causatives by an infixed vowel, and from passives by an optional infixed vowel:\n/fa/ 'yawn' > /tːfa/\n\nReciprocals are formed with the prefix /m(ː)-/, and recipro-causatives with /-m(ː)s-/, sometimes with internal change.\n\nPassives are formed with the prefix /tːu-/:\n/ħnːa/ 'pity' > /tːuħnːa/\n\nTense, mode, and subject\n\nPronominal complement markers cliticize to the verb, with the indirect object preceding the direct object, e.g. /izn-as-t/ \"he sold it to him\".\n\nCentral Atlas Tamazight uses a bipartate negative construction (e.g. /uriffiɣ ʃa/ 'he didn't go out') which apparently was modeled after proximate Arabic varieties, in a common development known as Jespersen's Cycle. This is a phenomenon where a postverbal item is reanalyzed as being an element of a discontinuous negation marker composed of it and the preverbal negation marker. It is present in multiple Berber varieties, and is argued to have originated in neighboring Arabic and been adopted by contact.\n\nStandard negation is accompanied by a negative indefinite pronoun, \"walu\".\n\nTamazight has a null copula. The words 'to be, to do' may function as a copula in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Seghrouchen respectively, especially in structures preceded by /aj/ 'who, which, what'.\n\nMany Arabic loans have been integrated into the Tamazight verb lexicon. They adhere fully to patterns of native stems, and may even undergo ablaut.\n\nAblaut\n\nIn Ayt Ayache, ablaut occurs only in affirmative and/or negative past (in applicable verb classes). Types of ablaut include Ø:i/a, Ø:i, and a:u, which may be accompanied by metathesis. In Ayt Seghrouchen types of ablaut include Ø:i (in negative), i/a, i/u, a-u, and a-i.\n\nAdjectives come after the noun the modify, and inflect for number and gender:\n\nAdjectives may also occur alone, in which case they become an NP.\n\nPractically all adjectives also have a verbal form used for predicative purposes, which behaves just like a normal verb:\n\nAs such, adjectives may be classed as a subset of verbs which also have other non-verbal features. However Penchoen (1973:21) argues that they are actually nouns.\n\nPrepositions\n\nPrepositions include ('on'), ('before'), ('to'), and ('until'). These may take pronominal suffixes (see Pronouns).\n\nSome prepositions require the following noun to be in the construct state, while others do not.\n\nConjunctions\n\nThe conjunction 'and' requires construct state, and also assimilates to a following , e.g. 'the donkey and the cow'.\n\nOther conjunctions include:\n\nCardinal numerals\n\nThe first few (1-3 in Ayt Ayache, 1-2 in Ayt Seghrouchen) cardinal numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms. The Arabic numerals are only used for counting in order and for production of higher numbers when combined with the tens.\nAll higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic. This is consistent with the linguistic universals that the numbers 1-3 are much more likely to be retained, and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated by the fact that Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.\n\nThe numbers 3-9 have special apocopated forms, used before the words ('years'), ('100'), ('1,000'), and ('million'), e.g. ('7 years'; without the preposition ).\nThe numbers 11-19 only end in before the words ('year') and ('thousand'; without the preposition ).\n\nCardinal numbers precede the modified noun, connected by the preposition (optional for the number 1).\n\nThe procliticization-triggered phonological change of may cause / and to become proclitics , , e.g. ('one boy'), ('one girl'), ('two rials').\n\nWhen referring to money, ('minus') and ('except') may be used, for example: / ('90 [rials]'), ('180 [rials]'), ('195 [rials]').\n\nNouns following numerals require construct state.\n\nOrdinal numerals\n\nThe word for 'the first' is unique in that it is not derived from a cardinal stem and it inflects for number:\nFrom 'the second' on, ordinals are formed by prefixing in the masculine and in the feminine (using the native Berber forms of 2 and 3).\n\nFractions\n\nThere are unique words which may be used for some fractions, although male ordinals can be used for 1/4 on.\n\nWord order is usually Verb + Subject [in construct state] but sometimes is Subject [in free state] + Verb, e.g. ( vs. 'the Berber went out'). Tamazight exhibits pro-drop behavior.\n\nwh- questions are always clefts, and multiple wh-questions are not found. This means that Tamazight cannot grammatically express an equivalent to the English \"who saw what?\".\nTamazight's clefting, relativisation, and wh-interrogation cause what is called \"anti-agreement effects\", similarly to Shilha. This is when the verb doesn't agree with or agrees in a special way with wh-words. In Berber, the feminine singular prefix disappears when the subject is a wh- phrase, but only for affirmative verbs.\n\n"}

If a sound is in contrastive distribution, it is considered a phoneme in that language.\n\nFor example, in English, the sounds and can both occur word-initially, as in the words \"pat\" and \"bat\" (minimal pairs), which are distinct morphemes. Therefore, and are in contrastive distribution and so are phonemes of English.\n\nNote that two sounds which are in contrastive distribution in one language can be in complementary distribution or free variation in another. These sounds occur in English, as in the word \"team\" and \"steam\" , but their occurrence is purely dependent upon phonological context. Therefore, in English, and are not in contrastive distribution but in complementary distribution.\n\nIn morphology, two morphemes are in contrastive distribution if they occur in the same environment, but have different meanings. \n\nFor example, in Korean, noun phrases are followed by one of the various markers that indicate syntactic role: /-ka/, /-i/, /-(l)ul/, etc. /-ka/ and /-i/ are in complementary distribution. They are both used to indicate nominative case, and their occurrence is conditioned by the final sound of the preceding noun. If the noun ends in a consonant, /-i/ occurs; otherwise, /-ka/. /-(l)ul/, on the other hand, occurs in the same position as /-i/ or /-ka/ and is also conditioned by the immediately previous sound, but it indicates the accusative case. Therefore, /-(l)ul/ and the set {/-i/, /-ka/} are in contrastive distribution.\n\nIn syntax, the requirements are similar. In English, the expression of the indicative and the subjunctive moods is contrastive:\n\nThe change from non-past first-person singular indicative \"am\" to the subjunctive \"were\" results in a change in the grammatical mood of the sentence.\n\n"}

It is a form of differential argument marking that applies to the direct object. In languages where DOM is active, direct objects are divided in two different classes, depending on different meanings, and, in most DOM languages, only one of the classes receives a marker, the other being unmarked (but there are languages, like Finnish, where both types of objects are marked with different endings).\n\nA well-known DOM language is Spanish. In Spanish, direct objects that are both human and specific require a special marker (the preposition \"a\" \"to\"):\n\n\nInanimate direct objects do not usually allow this marker, even if they are specific:\n\n\nYet, some animate objects that are specific can optionally bear the marker:\n\n\nSome dialectal variation has been attested regarding the use of DOM in different varieties of Spanish. Balasch finds that, while the linguistic factors conditioning the use of DOM remain the same in both Mérida (Venezuela) Spanish and Madrid Spanish, DOM appears much more often in Madrid data. Furthermore, Tippets and Schwenter find that a factor known as \"relative animacy\" (the animacy of the direct object relative to that of the subject) is quite important in the implementation of DOM in varieties of Spanish such as Buenos Aires and Madrid Spanish. \n\nOther examples of languages with differential object marking are Persian, Turkish, Copala Triqui, Khasi, Tamil, Malayalam, Kham, Hebrew and Amharic. A number of languages in Mozambique also show differential object marking.\nIn Turkish, the direct object can either have accusative case or have no (visible) case at all; when it has accusative case, it is interpreted as specific (e.g. one specific person), and otherwise it is interpreted as nonspecific (e.g. some person).\n\nThis is different from what happens in non-DOM languages, where all direct objects are uniformly marked in the same way; for instance, a language could mark all direct objects with an accusative ending (as in Quechua); other language could leave all direct objects without overt marker (as in English).\n\nAlthough the phenomenon has been known for a very long time, it was considered a minor quirk in a few languages until Georg Bossong, during the 1980s, presented evidence of DOM in more than 300 languages. Since then, it has become an important topic of research in grammatical theory. This is a selection of works that deal with the phenomenon:\n\n"}

{"id": "2556457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2556457", "title": "Fair comment", "text": "Fair comment\n\nFair comment is a legal term for a common law defense in defamation cases (libel or slander). It is referred to as honest comment in some countries.\n\nIn the United States, the traditional privilege of \"fair comment\" is seen as a protection for robust, even outrageous published or spoken opinions about public officials and public figures. Fair comment is defined as a \"common law defense [that] guarantees the freedom of the press to express statements on matters of public interest, as long as the statements are not made with ill will, spite, or with the intent to harm the plaintiff\".\n\nThe defense of \"fair comment\" in the U.S. since 1964 has largely been replaced by the ruling in \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\", 376 U.S. 254 (1964). This case relied on the issue of actual malice, which involves the defendant making a statement known at the time to be false, or which was made with a \"reckless disregard\" of whether the statement was true or false. If \"actual malice\" cannot be shown, the defense of \"fair comment\" is then superseded by the broader protection of the failure by the plaintiff to show \"actual malice\".\n\nEach state writes its own laws of defamation, and the laws and previously decided precedents in each state vary. In many states, (including Alabama where the case of \"Times v. Sullivan\" originated), the \"fair comment\" defense requires that the \"privilege of 'fair comment' for expressions of opinion depends on the truth of the facts upon which the comment is based\" according to U.S Supreme Court Justice Brennan who wrote the ruling in \"Times v. Sullivan\".\n\nIt is still technically possible to rely on the common law defense of \"fair comment\" without referring to the \"actual malice\" standard set by the Supreme Court of the United States but that would only be a likely course of action when the defendant is absolutely sure that the facts upon which the opinion of the defendant was based were true, or that any falsehoods are not defamatory. If those facts are not absolutely true (and the actual malice standard is not taken into account) then the defendant could be sued by the plaintiff for damages, although the plaintiff would need to establish to the satisfaction of a jury that the statements were defamatory, and that the defendant published or made them.\n\n\"Actual malice\" removes the requirement of being faultless in the reporting of the facts by the defendant. (Under the law prior to this decision any false statement could, if found to be defamatory, be grounds for damages.) Instead it raises the question of whether factual errors were made in good faith. \"Actual malice\" means then that the defendant intentionally made false statements of alleged facts, or recklessly failed to verify alleged facts when any reasonable person would have checked. If it is held that the defendant made intentionally false statements of fact, that will form a powerful argument that any statements of opinion based upon those facts were made with malice. If the plaintiff can prove malice on the part of the defendant the common law defense of \"fair comment\" is defeated.\n\nThe \"actual malice\" standard only applies when the statement is about a \"public official\", or a \"public figure\", or in some cases about a \"matter of public interest\". When it does apply it offers so much more protection to the defendant that it would be very rare for the defendant to assert \"fair comment\" instead. When the allegedly defamatory statement is about a purely private person, who is not a \"public figure\" in any way, the defendant may need to resort to the defense of \"fair comment\" instead.\nAlso, the \"actual malice\" standard is specifically part of United States law, derived from the U.S. Constitution. The defense of \"fair comment\" is a part of the older common law, and so might apply in non-U.S. jurisdictions which share the common-law tradition, such as the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth.\n\nIn Canada, for something to constitute fair comment, the comment must be on a matter of public interest (excluding gossip), based on known and provable facts, must be an opinion that any person is capable of holding based on those facts, and with no actual malice underlying it. The cardinal test of whether a statement is fair comment is whether it is recognizable as an opinion rather than a statement of fact, and whether it could be drawn from the known facts. There was formerly a rule stating that the opinion must be honestly held by the publisher (See Chernesky v. Armadale Publications Ltd. [1978] 6 W.W.R. 618 (S.C.C.)) but this rule was changed to one requiring that the opinion is capable of being held by anyone. (See Rafe Mair v. Kari Simpson [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420)\n\nFletcher-Moulton LJ said in Hunt v Star Newspaper [1908] 2 KB 309, Tab 3, at 319-320, CA:\n\nIn Branson v Bower [2002] QB 737, at p 748, para 29, Eady J said:\n\nWhether the comment is fair, Diplock J (as Lord Diplock then was) said in a summing up to jury in Silkin v. Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd. and Another [1958] 1 WLR 743, Tab 5, at 749:\n\nIn relation to malice in the context of fair comment (which is different from the malice in the context of qualified privilege), Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead NPJ said in Albert Cheng v Tse Wai Chun (2000) 3 HKCFAR 339 at p 360I to 361D:\n\nThe common law defence of fair comment in an action for defamation was abolished in the UK by the Defamation Act 2013, replaced with the statutory defence of honest opinion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "496944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=496944", "title": "Hypergraphia", "text": "Hypergraphia\n\nHypergraphia is a behavioral condition characterized by the intense desire to write or draw. Forms of hypergraphia can vary in writing style and content. It is a symptom associated with temporal lobe changes in epilepsy, which is the cause of the Geschwind syndrome, a mental disorder. Structures that may have an effect on hypergraphia when damaged due to temporal lobe epilepsy are the hippocampus and Wernicke's area. Aside from temporal lobe epilepsy, chemical causes may be responsible for inducing hypergraphia.\n\nIn some cases hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing. Drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes mixing both compulsive writing and drawing together.\n\nWaxman and Geschwind were the first to describe hypergraphia, in the 1970s. The patients they observed displayed extensively compulsive detailed writing, sometimes with literary creativity. The patients kept diaries, which some used to meticulously document minute details of their everyday activities, write poetry, or create lists. Case 1 of their study wrote lists of her relatives, her likes and dislikes, and the furniture in her apartment. Beside lists, the patient wrote poetry, often with a moral or philosophical undertone. She described an incident in which she wrote the lyrics of a song she learned when she was 17 several hundred times and another incident in which she felt the urge to write a word over and over again. Another patient wrote aphorisms and certain sentences in repetition.\n\nA patient from a separate study experienced \"continuously rhyming in his head\" for five years after a seizure and said that he \"felt the need to write them down.\" The patient did not talk in rhyme, nor did he read poetry. Language capacity and mental status were normal for this patient, except for recorded right temporal spikes on electroencephalograms. This patient had right hemisphere epilepsy. Functional MRI scans of other studies suggest that rhyming behavior is produced in the left hemisphere, but Mendez proposed that hyperactive electrical activity of the right hemisphere may induce a release of writing and rhyming abilities in the left hemisphere.\n\nIn addition to writing in different forms (poetry, books, repetition of one word), hypergraphia patients differ in the complexity of their writings. While some writers (e.g. Alice Flaherty) use their hypergraphia to help them write extensive papers and books, most patients do not write things of substance. Flaherty defines hypergraphia, as a result of temporal lobe epilepsy, as a condition that \"increase[s] idea generation, sometimes at the expense of quality.\" Patients hospitalized with temporal lobe epilepsy and other disorders causing hypergraphia have written memos and lists (like their favorite songs) and recorded their dreams in extreme length and detail. Some patients who also suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy record the times and locations of each seizure compiled as a list.\n\nThere are many accounts of patients writing in nonsensical patterns including writing in a center-seeking spiral starting around the edges of a piece of paper. In one case study, a patient even wrote backwards, so that the writing could only be interpreted with the aid of a mirror. Sometimes the writing can consist of scribbles and frantic, random thoughts that are quickly jotted down on paper very frequently. Grammar can be present, but the meaning of these thoughts is generally hard to grasp and the sentences are loose. In some cases, patients write extremely detailed accounts of events that are occurring or descriptions of where they are.\n\nSome studies have suggested that hypergraphia is related to bipolar disorder, hypomania, and schizophrenia. Although creative ability was observed in the patients of these studies, signs of creativity were observed, not hypergraphia specifically. Therefore, it is difficult to say with absolute certainty that hypergraphia is a symptom of these psychiatric illnesses because creativity in patients with bipolar disorder, hypomania, or schizophrenia may manifest into something aside from writing. However, other studies have shown significant accounts between hypergraphia and temporal lobe epilepsy and chemical causes. \n\nHypergraphia is a symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy, a condition of reoccurring seizures caused by excessive neuronal activity, but it is not a common symptom among patients. Less than 10 percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit characteristics of hypergraphia. Temporal lobe epilepsy patients may exhibit irritability, discomfort, or an increasing feeling of dread if their writing activity is disrupted. To elicit such responses when interrupting their writing suggests that hypergraphia is a compulsive condition, resulting in an obsessive motivation to write. A temporal lobe epilepsy may influence frontotemporal connections in such a way that the drive to write is increased in the frontal lobe, beginning with the prefrontal and premotor cortex planning out what to write, and then leading to the motor cortex (located next to the central fissure) executing the physical movement of writing.\n\nMost temporal lobe epilepsy patients who suffer from hypergraphia can write words, but not all may have the capacity to write complete sentences that have meaning.\n\nCertain drugs have been known to induce hypergraphia including donepezil. In one case study, a patient taking donepezil reported an elevation in mood and energy levels which led to hypergraphia and other excessive forms of speech (such as singing). Six other cases of patients taking donepezil and experiencing mania have been previously reported. These patients also had cases of dementia, cognitive impairment from a cerebral aneurysm, bipolar I disorder, and/or depression. Researchers are unsure why donepezil can induce mania and hypergraphia. It could potentially result from an increase in acetylcholine levels, which would have an effect on the other neurotransmitters in the brain.\n\nAnother potential cause of hypergraphia is from one of the body's neurotransmitters, dopamine (DA). Dopamine has been known to decrease latent inhibition, which causes a decrease in the ability to habituate to different stimuli. Low latent inhibition leads to an excessive level of stimulation and could contribute to the onset of hypergraphia and general creativity. This research implies that there is a direct correlation between the levels of DA between neuronal synapses and the level of creativity exhibited by the patient. DA agonists increase the levels of DA between synapses which results in higher levels of creativity, and the opposite is true for DA antagonists.\n\nSeveral regions of the brain are involved in the act of writing. Primary areas are the superior parietal cortex and the frontal lobe, the region of the brain that plans out movement. An area of the frontal lobe that is especially active is Exner's area, located in the premotor cortex. The physical motion of the hand is controlled by the primary motor cortex, also located in the frontal lobe, and the right cerebellum. Writing creatively and generating ideas, on the other hand, is controlled by the limbic system, specifically involving the activity of the hippocampus, which is important in the retrieval of long-term memories. Words and ideas are cognized and understood by the temporal lobes, and these temporal lobes are connected to the limbic system. \nAlthough hypergraphia cannot be isolated to one specific part of the brain, some areas are known to have more of an effect than others. The hippocampus has been found to play a role in the occurrence of temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia. In one study, rats induced with temporal lobe epilepsy showed an increase in dopamine neural activity in the hippocampus. Because hypergraphia has been linked to temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia, the hippocampus could have an effect on hypergraphia as well. In another study, patients with bilateral hippocampal atrophy (BHA) showed signs of having Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia.\n\nWhile epilepsy-induced hypergraphia is usually lateralized to the left cerebral hemisphere in the language areas, hypergraphia associated with lesions and other brain damage usually occurs in the right cerebral hemisphere. Lesions to the right side of the brain usually cause hypergraphia because they can disinhibit language function on the left side of the brain. Hypergraphia has also been known to be caused by right hemisphere strokes and tumors.\n\nLesions to Wernicke's area (in the left temporal lobe) can increase speech output, which can sometimes manifest itself in writing.\n\nHypergraphia was one of the central issues in the 1999 trial of Alvin Ridley for the imprisonment and murder of his wife Virginia Ridley. The mysterious woman, who had died in bed of apparent suffocation, had remained secluded in her home for 27 years in the small town of Ringgold, Georgia, USA. Her ten thousand page journal, which provided abundant evidence that she suffered from epilepsy and had remained housebound of her own will, was instrumental in the acquittal of her husband.\n\n\"I am a compulsive writer\", Isaac Asimov said in 1969. Vincent van Gogh and Fyodor Dostoevsky are reported to have been affected by hypergraphia . It has been suggested that the poet Robert Burns was a sufferer.\n\nLewis Carroll, the author of \"Alice in Wonderland\", is said to have had hypergraphia. In his lifetime he wrote over 98,000 letters varying in format. Some were written backwards, in rebus, and in patterns, as with \"The Mouse's Tale\" in \"Alice\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59173", "title": "Id, ego and super-ego", "text": "Id, ego and super-ego\n\nThe id, ego, and super-ego are three distinct, yet interacting agents in the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche.\n\nThe three parts are the theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction our mental life is described. According to this Freudian model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego.\n\nAs Freud explained:The functional importance of the ego is manifested in the fact that normally control over the approaches to motility devolves upon it. Thus in its relation to the id it is like a man on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with his own strength while the ego uses borrowed forces. The analogy may be carried a little further. Often a rider, if he is not to be parted from his horse, is obliged to guide it where it wants to go; so in the same way the ego is in the habit of transforming the id's will into action as if it were its own. (p. 19).Although the model is structural and makes reference to an apparatus, the id, ego and super-ego are purely psychological concepts and do not correspond to (somatic) structures of the brain such as the kind dealt with by neuroscience. The super-ego is observable in how someone can view themselves as guilty, bad, shameful, weak, and feel compelled to do certain things. Freud in \"The Ego and the Id\" discusses \"the general character of harshness and cruelty exhibited by the [ego] ideal – its dictatorial 'Thou shalt.\n\nFreud (1933) hypothesizes different levels of ego ideal or superego development with increasingly greater ideals:\nThe earlier in development, the greater the estimate of parental power. When one defuses into rivalry with the parental imago, then one feels the 'dictatorial thou shalt' to manifest the power the imago represents. Four general levels are found in Freud's work: the auto-erotic, the narcissistic, the anal, and the phallic. These different levels of development and the relations to parental imagos correspond to specific id forms of aggression and affection. For example, aggressive desires to decapitate, to dismember, to cannibalize, to swallow whole, to suck dry, to make disappear, to blow away, etc. animate myths, are enjoyed in fantasy and horror movies, and are observable in the fantasies and repressions of patients across cultures. \nThe concepts themselves arose at a late stage in the development of Freud's thought as the \"structural model\" (which succeeded his \"economic model\" and \"topographical model\") and was first discussed in his 1920 essay \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\" and was formalized and elaborated upon three years later in his \"The Ego and the Id\". Freud's proposal was influenced by the ambiguity of the term \"unconscious\" and its many conflicting uses.\n\nThe id (Latin for \"it\", ) is the disorganized part of the personality structure that contains a human's basic, instinctual drives. Id is the only component of personality that is present from birth. It is the source of our bodily needs, wants, desires, and impulses, particularly our sexual and aggressive drives. The id contains the libido, which is the primary source of instinctual force that is unresponsive to the demands of reality. The id acts according to the \"pleasure principle\"—the psychic force that motivates the tendency to seek immediate gratification of any impulse—defined as seeking to avoid pain or unpleasure (not \"displeasure\") aroused by increases in instinctual tension. According to Freud the id is unconscious by definition:\n\nIn the id:\n\nDevelopmentally, the id precedes the ego; i.e., the psychic apparatus begins, at birth, as an undifferentiated id, part of which then develops into a structured ego. While \"id\" is in search of pleasure, \"ego\" emphasizes the principle of reality. Thus, the id:\n\nThe mind of a newborn child is regarded as completely \"id-ridden\", in the sense that it is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses, and needs immediate satisfaction. The \"id\" moves on to what organism needs. Example is reduction of tension which is experienced. \n\nThe id \"knows no judgements of value: no good and evil, no morality. ...Instinctual cathexes seeking discharge—that, in our view, is all there is in the id.\" It is regarded as \"the great reservoir of libido\", the instinctive drive to create—the life instincts that are crucial to pleasurable survival. Alongside the life instincts came the death instincts—the death drive which Freud articulated relatively late in his career in \"the hypothesis of a \"death instinct\", the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state.\" For Freud, \"the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an \"instinct of destruction\" directed against the external world and other organisms\" through aggression. Freud considered that \"the id, the whole person...originally includes all the instinctual impulses...the destructive instinct as well\", as eros or the life instincts.\n\nThe ego (Latin for \"I\", ) acts according to the reality principle; i.e., it seeks to please the id's drive in realistic ways that will benefit in the long term rather than bring grief. At the same time, Freud concedes that as the ego \"attempts to mediate between id and reality, it is often obliged to cloak the [unconscious] commands of the id with its own preconscious rationalizations, to conceal the id's conflicts with reality, to profess...to be taking notice of reality even when the id has remained rigid and unyielding.\" The reality principle that operates the ego is a regulating mechanism that enables the individual to delay gratifying immediate needs and function effectively in the real world. An example would be to resist the urge to grab other people's belongings, but instead to purchase those items.\n\nThe ego is the organized part of the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive functions. Conscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious. Originally, Freud used the word ego to mean a sense of self, but later revised it to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgment, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defense, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning, and memory. The ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organize our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us. \"The ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. ...The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions...in its relation to the id it is like a person on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with their own strength, while the ego uses borrowed forces.\" Still worse, \"it serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id.\" Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety and allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal. \"Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it,\" and readily \"breaks out in anxiety—realistic anxiety regarding the external world, moral anxiety regarding the super-ego, and neurotic anxiety regarding the strength of the passions in the id.\" It has to do its best to suit all three, thus is constantly feeling hemmed by the danger of causing discontent on two other sides. It is said, however, that the ego seems to be more loyal to the id, preferring to gloss over the finer details of reality to minimize conflicts while pretending to have a regard for reality. But the super-ego is constantly watching every one of the ego's moves and punishes it with feelings of guilt, anxiety, and inferiority.\n\nTo overcome this the ego employs defense mechanisms. The defense mechanisms are not done so directly or consciously. They lessen the tension by covering up our impulses that are threatening. Ego defense mechanisms are often used by the ego when id behavior conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos or the individual's expectations as a result of the internalization of these morals, norms, and their taboos.\n\nDenial, displacement, intellectualisation, fantasy, compensation, projection, rationalization, reaction formation, regression, repression, and sublimation were the defense mechanisms Freud identified. However, his daughter Anna Freud clarified and identified the concepts of undoing, suppression, dissociation, idealization, identification, introjection, inversion, somatisation, splitting, and substitution.\n\nIn a diagram of the , the ego is depicted to be half in the consciousness, while a quarter is in the preconscious and the other quarter lies in the unconscious.\n\nIn modern English, ego has many meanings. It could mean one’s self-esteem; an inflated sense of self-worth; the conscious-thinking self; or in philosophical terms, one’s self. Ego development is known as the development of multiple processes, cognitive function, defenses, and interpersonal skills or to early adolescence when ego processes are emerged.\n\nThe super-ego () reflects the internalization of cultural rules, mainly taught by parents applying their guidance and influence. Freud developed his concept of the super-ego from an earlier combination of the ego ideal and the \"special psychical agency which performs the task of seeing that narcissistic satisfaction from the ego ideal is ensured...what we call our 'conscience'.\" For him \"the installation of the super-ego can be described as a successful instance of identification with the parental agency,\" while as development proceeds \"the super-ego also takes on the influence of those who have stepped into the place of parents — educators, teachers, people chosen as ideal models\".\nThe super-ego aims for perfection. It forms the organized part of the personality structure, mainly but not entirely unconscious, that includes the individual's ego ideals, spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called \"conscience\") that criticizes and prohibits their drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. \"The Super-ego can be thought of as a type of conscience that punishes misbehavior with feelings of guilt. For example, for having extra-marital affairs.\" Taken in this sense, the super-ego is the precedent for the conceptualization of the inner critic as it appears in contemporary therapies such as IFS.\n\nThe super-ego works in contradiction to the id. The super-ego strives to act in a socially appropriate manner, whereas the id just wants instant self-gratification. The super-ego controls our sense of right and wrong and guilt. It helps us fit into society by getting us to act in socially acceptable ways.\n\nThe super-ego's demands often oppose the id's, so the ego sometimes has a hard time in reconciling the two.\n\nFreud's theory implies that the super-ego is a symbolic internalisation of the father figure and cultural regulations. The super-ego tends to stand in opposition to the desires of the id because of their conflicting objectives, and its aggressiveness towards the ego. The super-ego acts as the conscience, maintaining our sense of morality and proscription from taboos. The super-ego and the ego are the product of two key factors: the state of helplessness of the child and the Oedipus complex. Its formation takes place during the dissolution of the Oedipus complex and is formed by an identification with and internalisation of the father figure after the little boy cannot successfully hold the mother as a love-object out of fear of castration. Freud described the super-ego and its relationship to the father figure and Oedipus complex thus:\nThe concept of super-ego and the Oedipus complex is subject to criticism for its perceived sexism. Women, who are considered to be already castrated, do not identify with the father, and therefore, for Freud, \"their super-ego is never so inexorable, so impersonal, so independent of its emotional origins as we require it to be in men...they are often more influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility.\" However, Freud went on to modify his position to the effect \"that the majority of men are also far behind the masculine ideal and that all human individuals, as a result of their human identity, combine in themselves both masculine and feminine characteristics, otherwise known as human characteristics.\"\n\nFreud's earlier, topographical model of the mind had divided the mind into the three elements of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. The conscious contains events that we are aware of, preconscious is events that are in the process of becoming conscious, and unconscious include events that we are not aware of. At its heart was \"the dialectic of unconscious traumatic memory versus consciousness...which soon became a conflict between System Ucs versus System Cs.\" With what Freud called the \"disagreeable discovery that on the one hand (super-)ego and conscious and on the other hand repressed and unconscious are far from coinciding,\" Freud took the step in the structural model to \"no longer use the term 'unconscious' in the systematic sense,\" and to rename \"the mental region that is foreign to the ego...[and] in future call it the 'id'.\" The partition of the psyche defined in the structural model is thus one that cuts across the topographical model's partition of \"conscious vs. unconscious\".\n\n\"The new terminology which he introduced has a highly clarifying effect and so made further clinical advances possible.\" Its value lies in the increased degree of precision and diversification made possible: Although the id is unconscious by definition, the ego and the super-ego are both partly conscious and partly unconscious. What is more, with this new model Freud achieved a more systematic classification of mental disorder than had been available previously:\n\nIt is important to realise however, that \"the three newly presented entities, the id, the ego and the superego, all had lengthy past histories (two of them under other names)\"—the id as the systematic unconscious, the super-ego as conscience/ego ideal. Equally, Freud never abandoned the topographical division of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious, though as he noted ruefully \"the three qualities of consciousness and the three provinces of the mental apparatus do not fall together into three peaceful couples...we had no right to expect any such smooth arrangement.\"\n\nThe iceberg metaphor is a commonly used visual metaphor when attempting to relate the ego, id and superego with the conscious and unconscious mind. In the iceberg metaphor the entire id and part of both the superego and the ego would be submerged in the underwater portion representing the unconscious mind. The remaining portions of the ego and superego would be displayed above water in the conscious mind area.\n\nThe terms \"id\", \"ego\", and \"super-ego\" are not Freud's own. They are latinisations by his translator James Strachey. Freud himself wrote of \"das Es\", \"das Ich\", and \"das Über-Ich\"—respectively, \"the It\", \"the I\", and \"the Over-I\" (or \"I above\"); thus to the German reader, Freud's original terms are more or less self-explanatory. Freud borrowed the term \"das Es\" from Georg Groddeck, a German physician to whose unconventional ideas Freud was much attracted (Groddeck's translators render the term in English as \"the It\"). The word \"ego\" is taken directly from Latin, where it is the nominative of the first person singular personal pronoun and is translated as \"I myself\" to express emphasis.\nFigures like Bruno Bettelheim have criticized the way \"the English translations impeded students' efforts to gain a true understanding of Freud.\" by substituting the formalised language of the elaborated code for the quotidian immediacy of Freud's own language.\n\n\n"}

However, the isolated characters have the same meaning in both languages: 手 (Grade 1) means \"hand\",\" and 紙 (Grade 2) means \"\"paper\".\"\n\n\"See also\" shinjitai \"and\" kyūjitai\".\"\n\nChina and Japan simplified their writing systems independently from each other. After World War II, their relations were not good, so they did not cooperate. Traditional Chinese characters are still officially used in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, South Korea (as a supplement to Hangul, but they are no longer used in North Korea), and by many overseas Chinese.\n\nIn Chinese, many more characters were simplified than in Japanese; some characters were simplified in only one language; other characters were simplified in the same way in both languages, and other characters were simplified in both languages but in different ways. This means that those who want to learn the writing systems of both languages must sometimes learn at least three different variations of one character: traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, and modern Japanese (for example 兩 - 两 - 両), some others have more variations, such as (斗 - 鬥 - 鬭 - 鬬 - 鬪 - 鬦 - 闘 - 閗), where are considered the older forms of Chinese characters and variations of different Chinese regions, and the older forms of Japanese characters (kyūjitai).\n\nNote that within the kyōiku kanji, there are 26 characters; the old forms of which may cause problems displaying:\n\n\nThese characters are Unicode CJK Unified Ideographs for which the old form (kyūjitai) and the new form (shinjitai) have been unified under the Unicode standard. Although the old and new forms are distinguished under the JIS X 0213 standard, the old forms map to Unicode CJK Compatibility Ideographs which are considered by Unicode to be canonically equivalent to the new forms and may not be distinguished by user agents. Therefore, depending on the user environment, it may not be possible to see the distinction between old and new forms of the characters.

{"id": "11147298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11147298", "title": "LOLITA", "text": "LOLITA\n\nLOLITA is a natural language processing system developed by Durham University between 1986 and 2000. The name is an acronym for \"Large-scale, Object-based, Linguistic Interactor, Translator and Analyzer\".\n\nLOLITA was developed by Roberto Garigliano and colleagues between 1986 and 2000. It was designed as a general-purpose tool for processing unrestricted text that could be the basis of a wide variety of applications. At its core was a semantic network containing some 90,000 interlinked concepts. Text could be parsed and analysed then incorporated into the semantic net, where it could be reasoned about (Long and Garigliano, 1993). Fragments of the semantic net could also be rendered back to English or Spanish.\n\nSeveral applications were built using the system, including financial information analysers and information extraction tools for Darpa’s “Message Understanding Conference Competitions” (MUC-6 and MUC-7). The latter involved processing original Wall Street Journal articles, to perform tasks such as identifying key job changes in businesses and summarising articles. LOLITA was one of a small number of systems worldwide to compete in all sections of the tasks. A system description and an analysis of the MUC-6 results were written by Callaghan (Callaghan, 1998).\n\nLOLITA was an early example of a substantial application written in a functional language: it consisted of around 50,000 lines of Haskell, with around 6000 lines of C. It is also a complex and demanding application, in which many aspects of Haskell were invaluable in development.\n\nLOLITA was designed to handle unrestricted text, so that ambiguity at various levels was unavoidable and significant. Laziness was essential in handling the explosion of syntactic ambiguity resulting from a large grammar, and it was much used with semantic ambiguity too. The system used multiple \"domain specific embedded languages\" for semantic and pragmatic processing and for generation of natural language text from the semantic net. Also important was the ability to work with complex abstractions and to prototype new analysis algorithms quickly.\n\nLater systems based on the same design include Concepts and SenseGraph.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13356749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13356749", "title": "Languages of Estonia", "text": "Languages of Estonia\n\nThe official language of Estonia is Estonian, a Uralic language which is related to Finnish. It is unrelated to the bordering Russian and Latvian languages, both of which are Indo-European (more specifically East Slavic and Baltic, respectively). Standard Estonian is mainly based on the North Estonian language, while South Estonian comprises several dialects, specifically Võro, Mulgi and Tartu. Võro, being furthest away from Standard Estonian, is the only one to have been given an ISO 639-3 language code by SIL (\"vro\"). Võru is widely accepted to have a subdialect Setu, although some consider it a separate language.\n\nRussian is by far the most spoken minority language in the country. There are towns in Estonia with large concentrations of Russian speakers and there are towns where Estonian speakers are in the minority (especially in the northeast, e.g. Narva).\n\nThe Baltic Germans (, or \"\") were mostly ethnically German inhabitants of the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, which today form the countries of Estonia and Latvia. The Baltic German population never made up more than 10% of the total. They formed the social, commercial, political and cultural élite in that region for several centuries. Some of them also took high positions in the military and civilian life of the Russian Empire, particularly in Saint Petersburg.\nTheir history and presence in the Baltics came to an abrupt end in late 1939 following the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the subsequent Nazi-Soviet population transfers when almost all the Baltic Germans were resettled by the German Government into the Wartheland and Danzig-West Prussia. Today there are very few Germans living in Estonia aside from some temporary residents from Germany. The German language is the third most popular foreign language among Estonians.\n\nThe Estonian Swedes, are a Swedish-speaking linguistic minority traditionally residing in the coastal areas and islands of what is now western and northern Estonia. The beginning of the continuous settlement of Estonian Swedes in these areas (known as \"Aiboland\") dates back to the 13th and 14th centuries, when their Swedish-speaking ancestors arrived in Estonia from what is now Sweden and Finland. Almost all of Estonia's Swedish-speaking minority fled to Sweden during World War II, and only the descendants of a few individuals who opted to stay are permanently resident in Estonia today.\n\nThe Estonian Sign Language (ESL, ) is the national sign language of Estonia. In 1998 there were about 4,500 signers out a population of 1,600 deaf and 20,000 hearing impaired. It is widespread in the cities of Tallinn and Pärnu among deaf ethnic Estonians; deaf Russian Estonians in Tallinn use Russian Sign Language, Russians outside Tallinn tend to use a Russian–Estonian Sign Language pidgin, or may be bilingual. In its formative stages, Estonian Sign Language was influenced by Russian and Finnish Sign Language; for example, the ESL sign for 'butterfly' developed from the Finnish sign for 'bird'. There are several dialects, the most archaic of which is the Pärnu variety.\n"}
{"id": "9604013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9604013", "title": "Languages of the Isle of Man", "text": "Languages of the Isle of Man\n\nThe main language of the Isle of Man is English, predominantly the Manx English dialect. Manx, the historical language of the island, is still maintained by a very small speaker population.\n\nBoth English and Manx are official languages in Tynwald.\n\nThe Manx language is a Celtic language of the Goidelic subdivision, and descendant of Old Irish. It is sometimes called Manx Gaelic to distinguish it from the local variety of English.\n\nThe language was historically the dominant one on the island, but fell out of use during the twentieth century, and is considered to have become extinct in 1974 after the death of Ned Maddrell. At the present time, less than one hundred children receive their education exclusively in Manx. There are an additional 1,689 second-language speakers, comprising 2.2% of the population of the Isle of Man. The language has been offered in public schools since 1992, and has been mandatory since 2001.\n\nThe English language has replaced Manx as the dominant language on the island. The native dialect is known as Anglo-Manx or Manx English, and has been employed by a number of the island's more notable writers such as T.E. Brown and \"Cushag\". which distinguishes itself by considerable influence and a large number of loanwords and phrases from Manx Gaelic. However, this dialect is being supplanted by other dialects of English, especially from north west England.\n\nFor formal purposes British English is the usual form of English used in the Isle of Man. For many years, the BBC has been the main broadcaster to the island, and many English people have settled in the IOM. \n\nForms of Irish English can also be heard on the island, from both Dublin and Belfast. The island has traditionally had many Irish tourists, and settlers.\n\nThere are a few people in the island who speak other languages habitually. These include Irish speakers. French, German and Spanish are also taught in the island's schools.\n\nOld Irish and Middle Irish are the ancestors of today's Manx language. Neither of these became extinct, so much as evolved, and Manx diverged from Scottish and Irish forms.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the three Gaelic languages maintained a single standard for higher registers and poetry. This is sometimes misleadingly referred to as \"Classical Irish\" - despite the fact it was much in use in Scotland and presumably the Isle of Man. It is also known as Classical Gaelic.\n\nMany of the island's placenames are Norse in origin, e.g. Laxey, Ramsey, and so are some of the island's institutions e.g. Tynwald (\"Þingvóllr\"). A few Norse inscriptions remain.\n\nThere seems to be evidence that the island once spoke a form of P-Celtic before it became Gaelicised. There is little evidence of this in placenames however.\n\nLatin and French have been used in ceremonial purposes, e.g. legal use, and mottos, as in the UK.\n\n"}

Today along with Vijay Tendulkar, he is credited as one of the most influential and progressive playwrights not just in Marathi theatre, but also in Indian theatre. In 2014, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour in performing arts in India.\n\nBorn to a 9th generation Telugu Brahmin migrant family in Parwa village in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, at the age of four he had to leave his parents and leave a city where he grew up a lonely child and hardly interested in studies, and raised outside of Indian urban centres. As films and theatre were taboo in his family, he saw his first play when he moved to Nagpur for his matriculation. Here he studied at Morris College, and went on to do M.A. in English from Nagpur University. While still college came the turning point in his life, when one day he went to watch a film and unable to get movie ticket, he ended up watching a play. That play was a veteran theatre director Vijaya Mehta's production of Vijay Tendulkar's \"Mee jinkalo mee Haralo\" (I Won, I Lost) in 1965. Deeply influenced by the play, he went to watch play again the following day and decided to write plays. He devoted the next year to reading plays of all kind.\n\nHe taught English literature at Dharampeth Arts, Commerce College, Nagpur and M. P. Deo Memorial Science College, Nagpur, until retiring as its Head in 1999.He was a guest professor of screen play-writing at the Film and Television Institute, Pune in 2000-2001.He taught as a visiting professor at the National school of Drama, New Delhi for a number of years.\n\nElkunchwar has experimented with many forms of dramatic expression, ranging from the realistic to symbolic, expressionist to absurd theatre with theme ranging from creativity to life, sterility to death and has influenced modern Indian theatre for more than three decades. Elkunchwar emerged onto the national theatre scene with the publication of his one-act play \"Sultan\" in 1967 in noted literary magazine \"Satyakatha\". This play was immediately noticed by Vijaya Mehta; she went on to direct four of his early plays, including \"Holi\" and \"Sultan\" in 1969 and 1970 for \"Rangayan\". A number of commercial hits followed such as \"Holi\" (1969), \"Raktapushpa\" (1971), \"Party\" (1972), \"Virasat\" (1982), and \"Atamkatha\" (1987).\n\nConsidered a successor to Vijay Tendulkar, Elkunchwar's plays are written in Marathi, the Indian language that is spoken by approximately 90 million people. The plays have been subsequently translated into multiple Indian and Western languages (including English, French and German).\n\nIn 1984, his play \"Holi\" was made into the film \"Holi\" by Ketan Mehta, for which he wrote the screenplay. In the same year, Govind Nihalani directed a film, \"Party\", based on his eponymous play. Sonata (2017), a film starring Aparna Sen, Shabana Azmi and Lilette Dubey was based on Elkunchwar's eponymous play.\n\nA lesser known fact about him is as Mahesh Elkunchwar, the essaysist. His collection of essays 'Maunraag' has broken new grounds in this genre and was considered the book of the decade in 2012. An uncanny blend of autobiographical and meditative, His essay show his erudition and a vivid imagination.\n\n\nOther works:\n\n\nElkunchwar's plays have gained national and international critical attention, and his growing body of work has become part of India's post-colonial theatrical canon. \nSome Important Honours, Awards :\n\n\nWorks in translations :\n\nCollected Plays of Mahesh Elkunchwar Volume I: Oxford University Press 2008\n\nCollected Plays of Mahesh Elkunchwar Volume II : Oxford University Press 2011\n"}

Papers are essential in legal or non-legal documentation.\n\nThe pulp papermaking process is said to have been developed in China during the early 2nd century CE, possibly as early as the year 105 CE, by the Han court eunuch Cai Lun, although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century BCE in China.\nThe modern pulp and paper industry is global, with China leading its production and the United States right behind it.\n\nThe oldest known archaeological fragments of the immediate precursor to modern paper date to the 2nd century BCE in China. The pulp paper-making process is ascribed to Cai Lun, a 2nd-century CE Han court eunuch.\n\nIn the 13th century, the knowledge and uses of paper spread from China through the Middle East to medieval Europe, where the first water powered paper mills were built. Because paper was introduced to the West through the city of Baghdad, it was first called \"bagdatikos\".\nIn the 19th century, industrialization greatly reduced the cost of manufacturing paper. In 1844, the Canadian inventor Charles Fenerty and the German F. G. Keller independently developed processes for pulping wood fibres.\n\nBefore the industrialisation of paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. Today this method is called deinking. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers.\n\nThe word \"paper\" is etymologically derived from Latin \"papyrus\", which comes from the Greek πάπυρος (\"papuros\"), the word for the \"Cyperus papyrus\" plant. Papyrus is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the \"Cyperus papyrus\" plant, which was used in ancient Egypt and other Mediterranean cultures for writing before the introduction of paper into the Middle East and Europe. Although the word paper is etymologically derived from papyrus, the two are produced very differently and the development of the first is distinct from the development of the second. Papyrus is a lamination of natural plant fibres, while paper is manufactured from fibres whose properties have been changed by maceration.\n\nTo make pulp from wood, a chemical pulping process separates lignin from cellulose fibres. This is accomplished by dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor, so that it may be washed from the cellulose; this preserves the length of the cellulose fibres. Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as wood-free papers–not to be confused with tree-free paper; this is because they do not contain lignin, which deteriorates over time. The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but this consumes 5% of the fibres; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90% cellulose.\n\nThere are three main chemical pulping processes: the sulfite process dates back to the 1840s and it was the dominant method extent before the second world war. The kraft process, invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s, is now the most commonly practiced strategy, one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin, that produces heat, which can be used to run a generator. Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper mill. Another advantage is that this process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents. Soda pulping is another specialty process used to pulp straws, bagasse and hardwoods with high silicate content.\n\nThere are two major mechanical pulps: thermomechanical pulp (TMP) and groundwood pulp (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two steel discs. In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper. Although large amounts of electrical energy are required to produce mechanical pulp, it costs less than the chemical kind.\n\nPaper recycling processes can use either chemically or mechanically produced pulp; by mixing it with water and applying mechanical action the hydrogen bonds in the paper can be broken and fibres separated again. Most recycled paper contains a proportion of virgin fibre for the sake of quality; generally speaking, de-inked pulp is of the same quality or lower than the collected paper it was made from.\n\nThere are three main classifications of recycled fibre:.\n\nRecycled papers can be made from 100% recycled materials or blended with virgin pulp, although they are (generally) not as strong nor as bright as papers made from the latter.\n\nBesides the fibres, pulps may contain fillers such as chalk or china clay, which improve its characteristics for printing or writing. Additives for sizing purposes may be mixed with it or applied to the paper web later in the manufacturing process; the purpose of such sizing is to establish the correct level of surface absorbency to suit ink or paint.\n\nThe pulp is fed to a paper machine where it is formed as a paper web and the water is removed from it by pressing and drying.\n\nPressing the sheet removes the water by force; once the water is forced from the sheet, a special kind of felt, which is not to be confused with the traditional one, is used to collect the water; whereas when making paper by hand, a blotter sheet is used instead.\n\nDrying involves using air or heat to remove water from the paper sheets. In the earliest days of paper making, this was done by hanging the sheets like laundry; in more modern times, various forms of heated drying mechanisms are used. On the paper machine, the most common is the steam-heated can dryer. These can reach temperatures above and are used in long sequences of more than forty cans where the heat produced by these can easily dry the paper to less than six percent moisture.\n\nThe paper may then undergo sizing to alter its physical properties for use in various applications.\n\nPaper at this point is \"uncoated\". Coated paper has a thin layer of material such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable for high-resolution halftone screens. (Uncoated papers are rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi.) Coated or uncoated papers may have their surfaces polished by calendering. Coated papers are divided into matte, semi-matte or silk, and gloss. Gloss papers give the highest optical density in the printed image.\n\nThe paper is then fed onto reels if it is to be used on web printing presses, or cut into sheets for other printing processes or other purposes. The fibres in the paper basically run in the machine direction. Sheets are usually cut \"long-grain\", i.e. with the grain parallel to the longer dimension of the sheet. Continuous form paper (or continuous stationery) is cut to width with holes punched at the edges, and folded into stacks.\n\nAll paper produced by paper machines as the Fourdrinier Machine are wove paper, i.e. the wire mesh that transports the web leaves a pattern that has the same density along the paper grain and across the grain. Textured finishes, watermarks and wire patterns imitating hand-made \"laid\" paper can be created by the use of appropriate rollers in the later stages of the machine.\n\nWove paper does not exhibit \"laidlines\", which are small regular lines left behind on paper when it was handmade in a mould made from rows of metal wires or bamboo. Laidlines are very close together. They run perpendicular to the \"chainlines\", which are further apart. Handmade paper similarly exhibits \"deckle edges\", or rough and feathery borders.\n\nPaper can be produced with a wide variety of properties, depending on its intended use.\nIt is estimated that paper-based storage solutions captured 0.33% of the total in 1986 and only 0.007% in 2007, even though in absolute terms, the world's capacity to store information on paper increased from 8.7 to 19.4 petabytes. It is estimated that in 1986 paper-based postal letters represented less than 0.05% of the world's telecommunication capacity, with sharply decreasing tendency after the massive introduction of digital technologies.\n\nPaper has a major role in the visual arts. It is used by itself to form two and three-dimensional shapes and collages. It has also evolved to being a structural material used in furniture design. Watercolor paper has a long history of production and use.\n\nThe thickness of paper is often measured by caliper, which is typically given in thousandths of an inch in the United States and in micrometers (µm) in the rest of the world. Paper may be between thick.\n\nPaper is often characterized by weight. In the United States, the weight assigned to a paper is the weight of a ream, 500 sheets, of varying \"basic sizes\", before the paper is cut into the size it is sold to end customers. For example, a ream of 20 lb, paper weighs 5 pounds, because it has been cut from a larger sheet into four pieces. In the United States, printing paper is generally 20 lb, 24 lb, or 32 lb at most. Cover stock is generally 68 lb, and 110 lb or more is considered card stock.\n\nIn Europe, and other regions using the ISO 216 paper sizing system, the weight is expressed in grammes per square metre (g/m or usually just g) of the paper. Printing paper is generally between 60 g and 120 g. Anything heavier than 160 g is considered card. The weight of a ream therefore depends on the dimensions of the paper and its thickness.\n\nMost commercial paper sold in North America is cut to standard paper sizes based on customary units and is defined by the length and width of a sheet of paper.\n\nThe ISO 216 system used in most other countries is based on the surface area of a sheet of paper, not on a sheet's width and length. It was first adopted in Germany in 1922 and generally spread as nations adopted the metric system. The largest standard size paper is A0 (A zero), measuring one square meter (approx. 1189 × 841 mm). A1 is half the size of a sheet of A0 (i.e., 594 mm × 841 mm), such that two sheets of A1 placed side by side are equal to one sheet of A0. A2 is half the size of a sheet of A1, and so forth. Common sizes used in the office and the home are A4 and A3 (A3 is the size of two A4 sheets).\n\nThe density of paper ranges from for tissue paper to for some speciality paper. Printing paper is about .\n\nPaper may be classified into seven categories:\n\nSome paper types include:\n\nMuch of the early paper made from wood pulp contained significant amounts of alum, a variety of aluminium sulfate salts that is significantly acidic. Alum was added to paper to assist in sizing, making it somewhat water resistant so that inks did not \"run\" or spread uncontrollably. Early papermakers did not realize that the alum they added liberally to cure almost every problem encountered in making their product is eventually detrimental. The cellulose fibres that make up paper are hydrolyzed by acid, and the presence of alum eventually degrades the fibres until the paper disintegrates in a process known as \"slow fire\". Documents written on rag paper are significantly more stable. The use of non-acidic additives to make paper is becoming more prevalent, and the stability of these papers is less of an issue.\n\nPaper made from mechanical pulp contains significant amounts of lignin, a major component in wood. In the presence of light and oxygen, lignin reacts to give yellow materials, which is why newsprint and other mechanical paper yellows with age. Paper made from bleached kraft or sulfite pulps does not contain significant amounts of lignin and is therefore better suited for books, documents and other applications where whiteness of the paper is essential.\n\nPaper made from wood pulp is not necessarily less durable than a rag paper. The aging behavior of a paper is determined by its manufacture, not the original source of the fibers. Furthermore, tests sponsored by the Library of Congress prove that all paper is at risk of acid decay, because cellulose itself produces formic, acetic, lactic and oxalic acids.\n\nMechanical pulping yields almost a tonne of pulp per tonne of dry wood used, which is why mechanical pulps are sometimes referred to as \"high yield\" pulps. With almost twice the yield as chemical pulping, mechanical pulps is often cheaper. Mass-market paperback books and newspapers tend to use mechanical papers. Book publishers tend to use acid-free paper, made from fully bleached chemical pulps for hardback and trade paperback books.\n\nThe production and use of paper has a number of adverse effects on the environment.\n\nWorldwide consumption of paper has risen by 400% in the past 40 years leading to increase in deforestation, with 35% of harvested trees being used for paper manufacture. Most paper companies also plant trees to help regrow forests. Logging of old growth forests accounts for less than 10% of wood pulp, but is one of the most controversial issues.\n\nPaper waste accounts for up to 40% of total waste produced in the United States each year, which adds up to 71.6 million tons of paper waste per year in the United States alone. The average office worker in the US prints 31 pages every day. Americans also use in the order of 16 billion paper cups per year.\n\nConventional bleaching of wood pulp using elemental chlorine produces and releases into the environment large amounts of chlorinated organic compounds, including chlorinated dioxins. Dioxins are recognized as a persistent environmental pollutant, regulated internationally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Dioxins are highly toxic, and health effects on humans include reproductive, developmental, immune and hormonal problems. They are known to be carcinogenic. Over 90% of human exposure is through food, primarily meat, dairy, fish and shellfish, as dioxins accumulate in the food chain in the fatty tissue of animals.\n\nSome manufacturers have started using a new, significantly more environmentally friendly alternative to expanded plastic packaging. Made out of paper, and known commercially as PaperFoam, the new packaging has mechanical properties very similar to those of some expanded plastic packaging, but is biodegradable and can also be recycled with ordinary paper.\n\nWith increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as PFOA) and the higher prices of hydrocarbon based petrochemicals, there is a focus on zein (corn protein) as a coating for paper in high grease applications such as popcorn bags.\n\nAlso, synthetics such as Tyvek and Teslin have been introduced as printing media as a more durable material than paper.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37231770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37231770", "title": "Pregroup grammar", "text": "Pregroup grammar\n\nPregroup grammar (PG) is a grammar formalism intimately related to categorial grammars. Much like categorial grammar (CG), PG is a kind of type logical grammar. Unlike CG, however, PG does not have a distinguished function type. Rather, PG uses inverse types combined with its monoidal operation.\n\nA pregroup is a partially ordered algebra formula_1 such that formula_2 is a monoid, satisfying the following relations:\n\n\nThe contraction and expansion relations are sometimes called Ajdukiewicz laws.\n\nFrom this, it can be proven that the following equations hold:\n\n\nformula_8 and formula_9 are called the left and right adjoints of \"x\", respectively.\n\nThe symbol formula_10 and formula_11 are also written formula_12 and formula_13 respectively. In category theory, pregroups are also known as autonomous categories or (non-symmetric) compact closed categories. More typically, formula_14 will just be represented by adjacency, i.e. as formula_15.\n\nA pregroup grammar consists of a lexicon of words (and possibly morphemes) \"L\", a set of atomic types \"T\" which freely generates a pregroup, and an relation formula_16 that relates words to types. In simple pregroup grammars, typing is a function that maps words to only one type each.\n\nSome simple, intuitive examples using English as the language to model demonstrate the core principles behind pregroups and their use in linguistic domains.\n\nLet \"L\" = {John, Mary, the, dog, cat, met, barked, at}, let \"T\" = {\"N, S, N\"}, and let the following typing relation holds:\n\nA sentence \"S\" that has type \"T\" is said to be grammatical if formula_19. We can prove this by use of a chain of formula_11. For example, we can prove that formula_21 is grammatical by proving that formula_22:\n\nby first using contraction on formula_24 and then again on formula_25. A more convenient notation exists, however, that indicates contractions by connecting them with a drawn link between the contracting types (provided that the links are nested, i.e. don't cross). Words are also typically placed above their types to make the proof more intuitive. The same proof in this notation is simply\n\nA more complex example proves that \"the dog barked at the cat\" is grammatical:\n\nPregroup grammars have been introduced by Joachim Lambek in 1993 as a development of his syntactic calculus, replacing the quotients by adjoints. Such adjoints had already been used earlier by Harris but without iterated adjoints and expansion rules.\nAdding such adjoints was interesting to handle more complex linguistic cases, where the fact that formula_26 is needed. It was also motivated by a more algebraic viewpoint: the definition of a pregroup is a weakening of that of a group, introducing a distinction between the left and right inverses and replacing the equality by an order. This weakening was needed because using types from a free group would not work: an adjective would get the type formula_27, hence it could be inserted at any position in the sentence.\n\nPregroup grammars have then been defined and studied for various languages (or fragments of them) including English, Italian, French, Persian and Sanskrit. Languages with a relatively free word order such as Sanskrit required to introduce commutation relations to the pregroup, using precyclicity.\n\nBecause of the lack of function types in PG, the usual method of giving a semantics via the λ-calculus or via function denotations is not available in any obvious way. Instead, two different methods exist, one purely formal method that corresponds to the λ-calculus, and one denotational method analogous to (a fragment of) the tensor mathematics of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe purely formal semantics for PG consists of a logical language defined according to the following rules:\n\n\nSome examples of terms are \"f\"(\"x\"), \"g\"(\"a\",\"h\"(\"x\",\"y\")), formula_29. A variable \"x\" is free in a term \"t\" if [\"x\"] does not appear in \"t\", and a term with no free variables is a closed term. Terms can be typed with pregroup types in the obvious manner.\n\nThe usual conventions regarding α conversion apply.\n\nFor a given language, we give an assignment \"I\" that maps typed words to typed closed terms in a way that respects the pregroup structure of the types. For the English fragment given above we might therefore have the following assignment (with the obvious, implicit set of atomic terms and function symbols):\n\nwhere \"E\" is the type of entities in the domain, and \"T\" is the type of truth values.\n\nTogether with this core definition of the semantics of PG, we also have a reduction rules that are employed in parallel with the type reductions. Placing the syntactic types at the top and semantics below, we have\n\nFor example, applying this to the types and semantics for the sentence formula_31 (emphasizing the link being reduced)\n\nFor the sentence formula_32:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "284713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=284713", "title": "Recitative", "text": "Recitative\n\nRecitative (, also known by its Italian name \"recitativo\" ()) is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition.\n\nRecitative can be distinguished on a continuum from more speech-like to more musical, with more sustained melodic lines. The mostly syllabic recitativo secco (\"dry\", accompanied only by continuo) is at one end of a spectrum through recitativo accompagnato (using orchestra), the more melismatic arioso, and finally the full-blown aria or ensemble, where the pulse is entirely governed by the music.\n\nThe term recitative (or occasionally liturgical recitative) is also applied to the simpler formulas of Gregorian chant, such as the tones used for the Epistle, Gospel, preface and collects; see accentus.\n\nThe first use of recitative in opera was preceded by the monodies of the Florentine Camerata in which Vincenzo Galilei, father of the astronomer Galileo Galilei, played an important role. The elder Galilei, influenced by his correspondence with Girolamo Mei on the writings of the ancient Greeks and with Erycius Puteanus on the writings of Hucbald and wishing to recreate the old manner of storytelling and drama, pioneered the use of a single melodic line to tell the story, accompanied by simple chords from a harpsichord or lute. \n\nIn the baroque era, recitatives were commonly rehearsed on their own by the stage director, the singers frequently supplying their own favourite baggage arias which might be by a different composer (some of Mozart's so-called concert arias fall into this category). This division of labour persisted in some of Rossini's works; the \"secco\" recitatives for \"The Barber of Seville\" and \"La Cenerentola\" were composed by assistants.\n\n\"Secco\" recitatives, popularized in Florence though the proto-opera music dramas of Jacopo Peri and Giulio Caccini during the late 16th century, formed the substance of Claudio Monteverdi's operas during the 17th century, and continued to be used into the 19th century Romantic era by such composers as Gaetano Donizetti, reappearing in Stravinsky's \"The Rake's Progress\". They also influenced areas of music outside opera from the outset; the recitatives of Johann Sebastian Bach, found in his passions and cantatas, are especially notable.\n\nIn the early operas and cantatas of the Florentine school, secco recitatives were accompanied by a variety of instruments, mostly plucked fretted strings including the chitarrone, often with a pipe organ to provide sustained tone. Later, in the operas of Vivaldi and Händel, the accompaniment was standardised as a harpsichord and a bass viol or violoncello. When the harpsichord was gradually phased out over the late 18th century, and mostly disappeared in the early 19th century, many opera-houses did not replace it with the fortepiano, a hammered-string keyboard invented in 1700. \n\nInstead the violoncello was left to carry on alone or with reinforcement from a double bass. A 1919 recording of Rossini's \"Barber of Seville\", issued by Italian HMV, gives a unique glimpse of this technique in action, as do cello methods of the period and some scores of Meyerbeer. There are examples of the revival of the harpsichord for this purpose as early as the 1890s (e.g. by Hans Richter for a production of Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" at the London Royal Opera House, the instrument being supplied by Arnold Dolmetsch), but it was not until the 1950s that the 18th-century method was consistently observed once more. In the 2010s, the early music revival movement has led to the re-introduction of harpsichord in some Baroque performances.\n\nAccompanied recitative, known as \"accompagnato\" or \"stromentato\", employs the orchestra as an accompanying body. As a result, it is less improvisational and declamatory than \"recitativo secco\", and more song-like. This form is often employed where the orchestra can underscore a particularly dramatic text, as in \"Thus saith the Lord\" from Händel's \"Messiah\"; Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were also fond of it. A more inward intensification calls for an arioso; the opening of \"Comfort ye\" from the same work is a famous example, while the ending of it (\"The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness\") is secco.\n\nSometimes a distinction is made between the more dramatic, expressive, or interjecting 'orchestral recitative' (\"recitativo obbligato\" or \"stromentato\") and a more passive and sustained 'accompanied recitative' (\"recitativo accompagnato\").\n\nLater operas, under the influence of Richard Wagner, favored through-composition, where recitatives, arias, choruses and other elements were seamlessly interwoven into a whole. Many of Wagner's operas employ sections which are analogous to accompanied recitative.\n\nRecitative is also occasionally used in musicals, being put to ironic use in the finale of Kurt Weill's \"The Threepenny Opera\". It also appears in \"Carousel\" and \"Of Thee I Sing\".\n\nGeorge Gershwin used it in his opera \"Porgy and Bess\", though sometimes the recitative in that work is changed to spoken dialogue. \"Porgy and Bess\" has also been staged as a musical rather than as an opera.\n\nRecitative has also sometimes been used to refer to parts of purely instrumental works which resemble vocal recitatives. One of the earliest examples is found in the slow movement of Vivaldi's violin concerto in D, RV 208 which is marked 'Recitative', although it is perhaps more virtuosic and flashy than most operatic recitative. C. P. E. Bach included instrumental recitative in his \"Prussian\" piano sonatas of 1742, composed at Frederick the Great's court in Berlin. In 1761, Joseph Haydn took his post at Esterhazy Palace and soon after composed his Symphony No. 7 (\"Le Midi\") in concertante style (i.e. with soloists). In the second movement of that work, the violinist is the soloist in an instrumental recitative.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven used the instrumental recitative in at least three works, including \"Piano Sonata No. 17\" (\"The Tempest\"), \"Piano Sonata No. 31\", and perhaps most famously in the opening section of the Finale of his Ninth Symphony. Here, Beethoven inscribed on the score (in French) \"In the manner of a recitative, but in tempo.\" Leon Plantinga argues that the second movement of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto is also an instrumental recitative, although Owen Jander interprets it as a dialogue.\n\nOther Romantic composers to employ instrumental recitative include Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (who composed a lyrical, virtuosic recitative for solo violin with harp accompaniment to represent the title character in his orchestral \"Scheherazade\") and Hector Berlioz (whose choral symphony \"Roméo et Juliette\" contains a trombone recitative as part of its Introduction).\n\nArnold Schoenberg labeled the last of his Five Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 16, as \"Das obligate Rezitativ\" (English: \"The obbligato recitative\"), and also composed a piece for organ, \"Variations on a Recitative\", Op. 40. Other examples of instrumental recitative in twentieth century music include the third movement of Douglas Moore's Quintet for Clarinet and Strings (1946), the first of Richard Rodney Bennett's \"Five Impromptus\" for guitar (1968), the opening section of the last movement of Benjamin Britten's String Quartet No. 3 (1975), and the second of William Bolcom's \"12 New Etudes for Piano\" (1977–86).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "740818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=740818", "title": "Siding", "text": "Siding\n\nSiding or wall cladding is the protective material attached to the exterior side of a wall of a house or other building. Along with the roof, it forms the first line of defense against the elements, most importantly sun, rain/snow, heat and cold, thus creating a stable, more comfortable environment on the interior side. The siding material and style also can enhance or detract from the building's beauty. There is a wide and expanding variety of materials to side with, both natural and artificial, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Masonry walls as such do not require siding, but any wall can be sided. Walls that are internally framed, whether with wood, or steel I-beams, however, must always be sided.\n\nMost siding consists of pieces of weather-resistant material that are smaller than the wall they cover, to allow for expansion and contraction of the materials due to moisture and temperature changes. There are various styles of joining the pieces, from board and batton, where the butt joints between panels is covered with a thin strip (usually 1 to 2 inches wide) of wood, to a variety of clapboard, also called lap siding, in which planks are laid horizontally across the wall starting from the bottom, and building up, the board below overlapped by the board above it. These techniques of joinery are designed to prevent water from entering the walls. Siding that does not consist of pieces joined together would include stucco, which is widely used in the Southwest. It is a plaster-like siding and is applied over a lattice, just like plaster. However, because of the lack of joints, it eventually cracks and is susceptible to water damage. \"Rainscreen\" construction is used to improve siding's ability to keep walls dry.\n\nThatch is an ancient and very widespread building material used on roofs and walls. Thatch siding is made with dry vegetation such as longstraw, water reeds, or combed wheat reed. The materials are overlapped and weaved in patterns designed to deflect and direct water.\n\nWood siding is very versatile in style and can be used on a wide variety of building structures. It can be painted or stained in any color palette desired.\n\nThough installation and repair is relatively simple, wood siding requires more maintenance than other popular solutions, requiring treatment every four to nine years depending on the severity of the elements to which it is exposed. Ants and termites are a threat to many types of wood siding, such that extra treatment and maintenance that can significantly increase the cost in some pest-infested areas.\n\nWood is a moderately renewable resource and is biodegradable. However, most paints and stains used to treat wood are not environmentally friendly and can be toxic. Wood siding can provide some minor insulation and structural properties as compared to thinner cladding materials.\n\nWood shingles or irregular cedar \"shake\" siding was used in early New England construction, and was revived in Shingle Style and Queen Anne style architecture in the late 19th century.\n\nWood siding in overlapping horizontal rows or \"courses\" is called clapboard, weatherboard (British English), or bevel siding which is made with beveled boards, thin at the top edge and thick at the butt.\n\nIn colonial North America, Eastern white pine was the most common material. Wood siding can also be made of naturally rot-resistant woods such as redwood or cedar.\n\nJointed horizontal siding (also called \"drop\" siding or novelty siding) may be shiplapped or tongue and grooved (though less common). Drop siding comes in a wide variety of face finishes, including Dutch Lap (also called German or Cove Lap) and log siding (milled with curve).\n\nVertical siding may have a cover over the joint: board and batten, popular in American wooden Carpenter Gothic houses; or less commonly behind the joint called \"batten and board\" or \"reversed board and batten\".\n\nPlywood sheet siding is sometimes used on inexpensive buildings, sometimes with grooves to imitate vertical shiplap siding. One example of such grooved plywood siding is the type called Texture 1-11 \"T1-11\" or \"T111\" (\"tee-one-eleven\"). There is also a product known as reverse board-and-batten \"RBB\" that looks similar but has deeper grooves. Some of these products may be thick enough and rated for structural applications if properly fastened to studs. Both T-11 and RBB sheets are quick and easy to install as long as they are installed with compatible flashing at butt joints.\n\nSlate shingles may be simple in form but many buildings with slate siding are highly decorative.\n\nWood clapboard is often imitated using vinyl siding or uPVC weatherboarding. It is usually produced in units twice as high as clapboard. Plastic imitations of wood shingle and wood shakes also exist.\n\nSince plastic siding is a manufactured product, it may come in unlimited color choices and styles. Historically vinyl sidings would fade, crack and buckle over time, requiring the siding to be replaced. However, newer vinyl options have improved and resist damage and wear better. Vinyl siding is sensitive to direct heat from grills, barbecues or other sources. Unlike wood, vinyl siding does not provide additional insulation for the building, unless an insulation material (e.g., foam) has been added to the product. It has also been criticized by some fire safety experts for its heat sensitivity. This sensitivity makes it easier for a house fire to jump to neighboring houses in comparison to materials such as brick, metal or masonry.\n\nVinyl siding has a potential environmental cost. While vinyl siding can be recycled, it cannot be burned (due to toxic dioxin gases that would be released). If dumped in a landfill, plastic siding does not break down quickly.\n\nVinyl siding is also considered one of the more unattractive siding choices by many. Although newer options and proper installation can eliminate this complaint, vinyl siding often has visible seam lines between panels and generally do not have the quality appearance of wood, brick, or masonry. The fading and cracking of older types of plastic siding compound this issue. In many areas of newer housing development, particularly in North America, entire neighbourhoods are often built with all houses clad in vinyl siding, given an unappealing uniformity. Some cities now campaign for house developers to incorporate varied types of siding during construction.\n\nA predecessor to modern maintenance free sidings was asphalt brick siding. Asphalt impregnated panels (about 2 feet by 4 feet) gave the appearance of brick or even stone. Many buildings have this siding, especially old sheds and garages. If the panels are straight and level and not damaged, the only indication that they are not real brick may be seen at the corner caps. Trademarked names included Insulbrick, Insulstone, Insulwood. Commonly used names now are faux brick, lick it and stick it brick, and ghetto brick. Often such siding is now covered over with newer metal or plastic siding. Today thin panels of real brick are manufactured for veneer or siding.\n\nInsulated siding has emerged as a new siding category in recent years. Considered an improvement over vinyl siding, insulated siding is custom fit with expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) that is fused to the back of the siding, which fills the gap between the home and the siding.\n\nProducts provide environmental advantages by reducing energy use by up to 20 percent. On average, insulated siding products have an R-value of 3.96, triple that of other exterior cladding materials. Insulated siding products are typically Energy Star qualified, engineered in compliance with environmental standards set by the U.S. Department of Energy and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn addition to reducing energy consumption, insulated siding is a durable exterior product, designed to last more than 50 years, according to manufacturers. The foam provides rigidity for a more ding- and wind-resistant siding, maintaining a quality look for the life of the products. The foam backing also creates straighter lines when hung, providing a look more like that of wood siding, while remaining low maintenance.\n\nManufacturers report that insulated siding is permeable or \"breathable\", allowing water vapor to escape, which can protect against rot, mold and mildew, and help maintain healthy indoor air quality.\n\nMetal siding comes in a variety of metals, styles, and colors. It is most often associated with modern, industrial, and retro buildings. Utilitarian buildings often use corrugated galvanized steel sheet siding or cladding, which often has a coloured vinyl finish. Corrugated aluminium cladding is also common where a more durable finish is required, while also being lightweight for easy shaping and installing making it a popular metal siding choice.\n\nFormerly, imitation wood clapboard was made of aluminium (aluminium siding). That role is typically played by vinyl siding today. Aluminium siding is ideal for homes in coastal areas (with lots of moisture and salt), since aluminium reacts with air to form aluminium oxide, an extremely hard coating that seals the aluminium surface from further degradation. In contrast, steel forms rust, which can weaken the structure of the material, and corrosion-resistant coatings for steel, such as zinc, sometimes fail around the edges as years pass. However, an advantage of steel siding can be its dent-resistance, which is excellent for regions with severe storms—especially if the area is prone to hail.\n\nThe first architectural application of aluminium was the mounting of a small grounding cap on the Washington Monument in 1884. Sheet-iron or steel clapboard siding units had been patented in 1903, and Sears, Roebuck & Company had been offering embossed steel siding in stone and brick patterns in their catalogues for several years by the 1930s. ALCOA began promoting the use of aluminium in architecture by the 1920s when it produced ornamental spandrel panels for the Cathedral of Learning and the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings in New York. The exterior of the A.O. Smith Corporation Building in Milwaukee was clad entirely in aluminium by 1930, and 3'-square siding panels of Duralumin sheet from ALCOA sheathed an experimental exhibit house for the Architectural League of New York in 1931. Most architectural applications of aluminium in the 1930s were on a monumental scale, and it would be another six years before it was put to use on residential construction.\n\nIn the first few years after World War II, manufacturers began developing and widely distributing aluminium siding. Among them Indiana businessman Frank Hoess was credited with the invention of the configuration seen on modern aluminium siding. His experiments began in 1937 with steel siding in imitation of wooden clapboards. Other types of sheet metal and steel siding on the market at the time presented problems with warping, creating openings through which water could enter, introducing rust. Hoess remedied this problem through the use of a locking joint, which was formed by small flap at the top of each panel that joined with a U-shaped flange on the lower edge of the previous panel thus forming a watertight horizontal seam. After he had received a patent for his siding in 1939, Hoess produced a small housing development of about forty-four houses covered in his clapboard-style steel siding for blue-collar workers in Chicago. His operations were curtailed when war plants commandeered the industry. In 1946 Hoess allied with Metal Building Products of Detroit, a corporation that promoted and sold Hoess siding of ALCOA aluminium. Their product was used on large housing projects in the northeast and was purportedly the siding of choice for a 1947 Pennsylvania development, the first subdivision to solely use aluminium siding. Products such as 4\", 6\", 8\" and 10\" X 12' unpainted aluminium panels, starter strips, corner pieces and specialized application clips were assembled in the Indiana shop of the Hoess brothers. Siding could be applied over conventional wooden clapboards, or it could be nailed to studs via special clips affixed to the top of each panel. Insulation was placed between each stud. While the Hoess Brothers company continued to function for about twelve more years after the dissolution of the Metal Building Products Corporation in 1948, they were not as successful as rising siding companies like Reynolds Metals.\n\nStone and masonry veneer is sometimes considered \"siding\", are varied and can accommodate a variety of styles—from formal to rustic. Though masonry can be painted or tinted to match many color palettes, it is most suited to neutral earth tones, and coatings such as roughcast and pebbeldash. Masonry has excellent durability (over 100 years), and minimal maintenance is required. The primary drawback to masonry siding is the initial cost.\n\nPrecipitation can threaten the structure of buildings, so it is important that the siding will be able to withstand the weather conditions in the local region. For regions that receive a lot of rain, exterior insulation finishing systems (EIFS) have been known to suffer underlying wood rot problems with excessive moisture exposure.\n\nThe environmental impact of masonry depends on the type of material used. In general, concrete and concrete based materials are intensive energy materials to produce. However, the long durability and minimal maintenance of masonry sidings mean that less energy is required over the life of the siding.\n\nVarious composite materials are also used for siding: asphalt shingles, asbestos, fiber cement, aluminium (ACM), fiberboard, hardboard, \"etc.\" They may be in the form of shingles or boards, in which case they are sometimes called clapboard.\n\nComposite sidings are available in many styles and can mimic the other siding options. Composite materials are ideal for achieving a certain style or 'look' that may not be suited to the local environment (e.g., corrugated aluminium siding in an area prone to severe storms; steel in coastal climates; wood siding in termite-infested regions).\n\nCosts of composites tend to be lower than wood options, but vary widely as do installation, maintenance and repair requirements. Not surprisingly, the durability and environmental impact of composite sidings depends on the specific materials used in the manufacturing process.\n\nFiber cement siding is a class of composite siding that is usually made from a combination of cement, cellulose (wood), sand, and water. They are either coated or painted in the factory or installed and then painted after installation. Fiber cement is popular for its realistic look, durability, low-maintenance properties, and fire resistance. Composite siding products containing cellulose (wood fibers) have been shown to have problems with deterioration, delamination, or loss of coating adhesion in certain climates or under certain environmental conditions.\n\nA younger class of non-wood synthetic siding has sprouted in the past 15 years. These products are usually made from a combination of non-wood materials such as polymeric resins, fiberglass, stone, sand, and fly ash and are chosen for their durability, curb appeal, and ease of maintenance. Given the newness of such technologies, product lifespan can only be estimated, varieties are limited, and distribution is sporadic.\n\n"}

{"id": "594196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=594196", "title": "Wadcutter", "text": "Wadcutter\n\nA wadcutter is a special-purpose flat-fronted bullet specifically designed for shooting paper targets, usually at close range and at subsonic velocities typically under approximately 900 ft/s (274 m/s). Wadcutters have also found favor for use in self-defense guns, such as .38 caliber snubnosed revolvers, where, due to short barrel lengths, maximum bullet velocities are usually low, typically under 900 ft/s (274 m/s), and improved lethality is desired. Wadcutters are often used in handgun and airgun competitions.\n\nA wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that is typically as wide as the caliber size or only slightly smaller in diameter than caliber size. For target shooting, a wadcutter cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target in the favor of the shooter. Because the flat nosed bullet is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used only in revolvers or in specially designed semi-automatic pistols, although this is not always the case as some wadcutters may have rounded bullet nose profiles.\n\nA variety of wadcutter types exist: HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter), DEWC (Double-ended wadcutters), BBWC (Beveled-Base Wadcutters), and SWC (Semi-Wadcutters). HBWC rounds are best used at only the lowest velocities, as by being hollow at the rear end, they can split under heavy loads. DEWC rounds are best suited for automatic press reloading uses, as they may be used when loaded with either end pointed forward. BBWC have been developed to permit easier bullet insertion into the case when reloading. SWC rounds were developed to permit them to be loaded in either semi-automatic pistols or revolvers, where the rounded bullet shape often works better with feed ramps on semi-automatic pistols, and they are often used for heavy loads intended either for hunting or for self-defense. Some SWC bullet designs have a smaller diameter rear end, making these bullets suitable for use with gas checks. Properly lubricated SWC bullets with gas checks are suitable for use at velocities exceeding 1700 ft/s (518 m/s), the gas check reducing leading within the bore.\n\nThe maximum accurate distance of wadcutters varies considerably with the shape of the front of the bullet. Full caliber diameter wadcutters are suitable for use only at short ranges, typically not being used at ranges exceeding 25 yards where accuracy is especially desirable. At distances beyond 50 yards, full caliber diameter wadcutters become highly inaccurate. On the other hand, SWC bullets can maintain high accuracy at ranges exceeding 100 yards. In general, semi-wadcutters having a partially rounded nose are more accurate than wadcutters having a flat-front profile. In contrast, flat-front profile wadcutters tend to have improved lethality for hunting or self-defense purposes.\n\nAll lead wadcutters require proper lubrication to prevent leading of rifling and forcing cones when used in firearms. With proper lubrication, no leading for solid lead wadcutters occurs until velocities exceed approximately 940 ft/s. Without proper lubrication, however, severe leading can occur quickly, in as few as a couple of rounds. Most DEWC, BBWC, HBWC, and SWC bullets have 1, 2, or 3 lubrication grooves, with or without an additional 1 or 2 crimping grooves. (Having two crimping grooves is sometimes seen in dual-use bullets, such as intended for use with both .38 Special and .357 Magnum cartridges, or, similarly, for use with both .44 Special and .44 Magnum, in instances where overall cartridge lengths may need to be set differently so as to achieve the highest accuracy.) Used in revolvers, wadcutters must be roll crimped. Used in semi-automatic pistols, wadcutters must be taper crimped. Used in single-shot firearms (e.g., Thompson Center Contender or Encore), no crimping is absolutely required, but higher velocities may be achieved with either a roll or taper crimp, depending on cartridge, to permit pressure to rise higher before the bullet is released from the brass case.\n\nWadcutter bullets for center-fire firearms often have a modified profile with a reduced-diameter central point or rounded section. This was developed to allow the use of wadcutter bullets without causing excessive damage to the rubber anti-splashback curtain on indoor ranges. This profile produces a clean cut without tearing of the paper on the paper target for scoring but will only partially deform a rubber curtain and rebound before penetrating enough to cut the surface of the rubber mat.\n\nWadcutters can be loaded flush with the brass case opening or they may be set to extend out of the brass case, depending on what provides the most accuracy; the desired powder capacity of the case; or other desired criteria. Both varieties of wadcutters (flush, or non-flush) are commercially available. Although primarily intended for target practice, wadcutters can be used for close-in self-defense and hunting because their sharp edges and close-range accuracy are claimed to increase lethality.\n\nWadcutters are typically made from lead. Deposition of lead into the rifling grooves of barrels and into the forcing cones of revolvers limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900 ft/s. Shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the forcing cone, introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup. Either a mechanical lead removing tool (i.e., a Lewis Lead Remover or a generic equivalent) and/or chemical removal techniques may be used to remove the lead build-up caused from shooting wadcutters at too high a velocity.\n\nTarget airguns used for 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol competitions generally shoot wadcutter pellets at muzzle velocities around . The use of wadcutter match diabolo pellets is nearly universal in airgun target shooting where paper targets are used, at distances of 25 meters or less.\n\n"}

The film was released in the United States on June 14, 2002.\n\nDuring World War II, USMC Cpl Joseph F. \"Joe\" Enders returns to active duty with the aid of his pharmacist, Rita, having previously survived a gruesome battle on the Solomon Islands against the Imperial Japanese Army that killed his entire squad and left him almost deaf in his left ear. Enders' new assignment is to protect Navajo code talker Pvt. Ben Yahzee, and carries a promotion for Enders to Sergeant. Sgt. Pete \"Ox\" Henderson also receives a parallel assignment protecting Navajo code talker Pvt. Charlie Whitehorse.\n\nYahzee and Whitehorse, lifelong friends from the same Navajo tribe, are trained to send and receive coded messages that direct artillery fire. Enders and Henderson are instructed to kill their code talkers if capture is imminent so that the code cannot fall into enemy hands. As Enders and Henderson meet Yahzee and Whitehorse, it becomes apparent that the two experienced Marines are less than happy to be babysitting their Navajo codetalkers, and the Navajos must also endure racial harassment by some of the white Marines, notably Private Chick. During their missions, however, Henderson and Whitehorse discover a mutual love of music. Enders and Yahzee also discover that they have much in common, notably their Catholic upbringings.\n\nThe invasion of Saipan becomes Yahzee's and Whitehorse's first combat experience. After the beachhead is secured, the Marines come under friendly fire from U.S. artillery. Yahzee's radio is destroyed and the convoy is unable to call off the bombardment. Yahzee suggests that he disguise himself as a Japanese soldier and slip behind enemy lines to commandeer a radio, with Enders as his prisoner. Yahzee is forced to kill for the first time before he can redirect U.S. artillery fire onto the Japanese position. For their bravery, Enders is awarded a Silver Star by the commanding officer, with Yahzee's role almost ignored until Enders points him out but still credits Enders. Later, after a night of sake drinking, Yahzee performs Navajo rituals over the unconscious Enders to protect him with the spirits.\n\nThat night, the Marines camp in the nearby village of Tanapag. While Yahzee is temporarily assigned back to the command post to translate a code, Enders becomes increasingly torn because he cannot imagine killing Yahzee, despite his orders. He demands to be relieved from his unit but his request is denied. The next morning, Japanese soldiers ambush the village. Henderson is killed and Whitehorse is about to be captured. Enders sees Whitehorse being beaten and dragged away by the Japanese. Enders, realizing the Japanese will torture him for the code, throws a grenade at Whitehorse, killing him and his captors.\n\nYahzee returns to Tanapag and, seeing Whitehorse's body, screams at Enders to explain what happened as the village was thought to be secured. Enders, exhausted, mutters that he killed Whitehorse, but does not reveal that Whitehorse was willing to die to protect the code. Outraged, Yahzee aims his weapon at Enders but cannot bring himself to kill him. Enders confesses that he hated having to kill Whitehorse and that, like Henderson, his mission was to protect the code above all else.\n\nThe Marines are mobilized on another mission and are once again ambushed, this time near a deadly minefield on Mt. Tapochau, during which many Marines are killed. Enders, Yahzee, Chick, and Cpl. Pappas (the last of the Marines) take cover on a ridge, and see Japanese artillery fire from the top of the ridge attacking a Marine convoy below their position. Still enraged over the death of Whitehorse, Yahzee charges the Japanese line fearlessly, and in doing so, fumbles the radio needed to call in the coordinates for a bombardment. Yahzee and Enders are both shot as they retrieve the radio and call in an airstrike on the Japanese artillery. However, surrounded and knowing the Japanese will capture and torture him for the code as they almost did with Whitehorse, Yahzee entreats Enders to kill him. Enders, determined that no one else will die that day, manages to carry Yahzee to safety, albeit taking a shot in the chest. Friendly planes arrive and the Japanese position is successfully destroyed. Yahzee rejoices in their success but finds Enders mortally wounded. With his last breaths, Enders reverts to the religious upbringing he earlier claimed he had abandoned, and recites a Hail Mary.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Yahzee, his wife, and his son George Washington Yahzee, sit atop Point Mesa in Monument Valley, Arizona, and, wearing the sacred necklaces and other Navajo ceremonial dress, performs the Navajo ritual of paying respects to Enders. He tells his son that Enders was a fierce warrior and Marine and, that if his son ever tells a story about Enders, to simply say that he was Yahzee's friend. He then cleans Enders' dog tags in holy water and lifts them to the sky while chanting in ritual.\n\nAn epilogue states that the Navajo code was crucial to America's success against Japan across the Pacific theater and that, during the war, the code was never broken.\n\n\nFilming locations on Hawaii included Kualoa Ranch, the location where \"Lost\" and \"Jurassic Park\" were shot. To portray the Marines in the film the producers recruited extras that were volunteers from Schofield Barracks Army Base, Hickam Air Force Base, Pearl Harbor Naval Station, and Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station. Some of the actual Marines from 4th Force Recon Company were used in the film portraying their actual job. Some violence was trimmed in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. This violence trim was restored for the Director's cut released on DVD running 134 minutes.\n\nFor the F6F Hellcat fighters that appear in the beach-landing scenes on Saipan, the producers used computer-generated versions.\n\nThe film was a box office bomb, grossing only just under $41 million at the US box-office and a combined $77.6 million worldwide.\n\n\"Windtalkers\" received negative reviews from critics. The film currently holds a 32% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes, based on 167 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars, remarking that \"the filmmakers have buried it beneath battlefield cliches, while centering the story on a white character played by Nicolas Cage\".\n\nThe film was criticized for featuring the Navajo characters only in supporting roles; they were not the primary focus of the film. The film was ranked number four on Careeraftermilitary.com's \"10 Most Inaccurate Military Movies Ever Made,\" which also included \"The Patriot\", \"The Hurt Locker\", \"U-571\", \"The Green Berets\", \"Pearl Harbor\", \"Battle of the Bulge\", \"Red Tails\", \"Enemy at the Gates\" and \"Flyboys\" on its list of falsified war movie productions.\n\n\n"}
