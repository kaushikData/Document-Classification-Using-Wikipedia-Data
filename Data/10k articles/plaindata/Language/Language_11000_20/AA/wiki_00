{"id": "10240549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10240549", "title": "American Sign Language grammar", "text": "American Sign Language grammar\n\nThe grammar of American Sign Language (ASL) is the best studied of any sign language, though research is still in its infancy, dating back only to William Stokoe in the 1960s.\n\nASL morphology is to a large extent iconic. This shows up especially well in reduplication and indexicality.\n\nCompounding is used to derive new words in ASL, which often differ in meaning from their constituent signs. For example, the signs FACE and STRONG compound to create a new sign FACE^STRONG, meaning 'to resemble'. Compounds undergo the phonetic process of \"hold deletion\", whereby the holds at the end of the first constituent and the beginning of the second are elided:\nMany ASL nouns are derived from verbs. This may be done either by reduplicating the movement of the verb if the verb has a single movement, or by restraining (making smaller and faster) the movement of the verb if it already has repeated movement. For example, the noun CHAIR is derived from the verb SIT through reduplication. Another productive method is available for deriving nouns from non-stative verbs. This form of derivation modifies the verb's movement, reduplicating it in a \"trilled\" manner (\"small, quick, stiff movements\"). For example, this method is used to derive the noun ACTION from the verb ACT.\n\nCharacteristic adjectives, which refer to inherent states, may be derived from adjectives which refer to \"incidental or temporary states\". Characteristic adjectives always use both hands, even if the source adjective only uses one, and they always have repeated, circular movement. Additionally, if the source adjective was one-handed, the derived adjective has alternating movement. \"Trilling\" may also be used productively to derive adjectives with an \"ish\" meaning, e.g. BLUE becomes BLUISH.\n\nASL occasionally uses suffixation in derivation, but less often than in English. Agent nouns may be derived from verbs by adding the suffix AGENT and deleting the final hold of the verb, e.g. TEACH+AGENT 'teacher'. Superlatives are also formed by suffixation, e.g. SMART+MOST 'smartest'.\n\nCertain types of signs, for example those relating to time and age, may incorporate numbers by assimilating their handshape. For example, the word WEEK has handshape /B/ with the weak hand and /1/ with the active hand; the active hand's handshape may be changed to the handshape of any number up to 9 to indicate that many weeks.\n\nThere are about 20 non-manual modifiers in ASL, which are either adjectival or adverbial. For example, the adverb 'th', realized as the tongue being placed between the teeth, means 'carelessly / lazily' when combined with a verb:\nMouthing (making what appear to be speech sounds) is important for fluent signing, and it has morphological uses. For example, one may sign 'man tall' to indicate \"the man is tall,\" but by mouthing the syllable \"cha\" while signing 'tall', the phrase becomes \"that man is enormous!\"\n\nThere are other ways of modifying a verb or adjective to make it more intense. These are all more or less equivalent to adding the word \"very\" in English; which morphology is used depends on the word being modified. Certain words which are short in English, such as 'sad' and 'mad', are sometimes fingerspelled rather than signed to mean 'very sad' and 'very mad'. However, the concept of 'very sad' or 'very mad' can be portrayed with the use of exaggerated body movements and facial expressions. Reduplication of the signs may also occur to emphasize the degree of the statement. Some signs are produced with an exaggeratedly large motion, so that they take up more sign space than normal. This may involve a back-and-forth scissoring motion of the arms to indicate that the sign ought to be yet larger, but that one is physically incapable of making it big enough. Many other signs are given a slow, tense production. The fact that this modulation is morphological rather than merely mimetic can be seen in the sign for 'fast': both 'very slow' and 'very fast' are signed by making the motion either unusually slowly or unusually quickly than it is in the citation forms of 'slow' and 'fast'—not exclusively by making it slower for 'very slow' and faster for 'very fast'.\n\nReduplication (morphological repetition) is extremely common in ASL. Generally the motion of the sign is shortened as well as repeated. Nouns may be derived from verbs through reduplication. For example, the noun \"chair\" is formed from the verb \"to sit\" by repeating it with a reduced degree of motion. Similar relationships exist between \"acquisition\" and \"to get, airplane\" and \"to fly (on an airplane),\" also \"window\" and \"to open/close a window.\"\n\nReduplication is commonly used to express intensity as well as several verbal aspects (see below). It is also used to derive signs such as 'every two weeks' from 'two weeks', and is used for verbal number (see below), where the reduplication is iconic for the repetitive meaning of the sign.\n\nMany ASL words are historically compounds. However, the two elements of these signs have fused, with features being lost from one or both, to create what might be better called a blend than a compound. Typically only the final hold (see above) remains from the first element, and any reduplication is lost from the second.\n\nAn example is the verb \"AGREE\", which derives from the two signs \"THINK\" and \"ALIKE\". The verb \"THINK\" is signed by bringing a 1 hand inward and touching the forehead (a move and a hold). \"ALIKE\" is signed by holding two 1 hands parallel, pointing outward, and bringing them together two or three times. The compound/blend \"AGREE\" starts as \"THINK\" ends: with the index finger touching the forehead (the final hold of that sign). In addition, the weak hand is already in place, in anticipation of the next part of the sign. Then the hand at the forehead is brought down parallel to the weak hand; it approaches but does not make actual contact, and there is no repetition.\n\nASL, like other mature signed languages, makes extensive use of morphology. Many of ASL's affixes are combined simultaneously rather than sequentially. For example, Ted Supalla's seminal work on ASL verbs of motion revealed that these signs consist of many different affixes, articulated simultaneously according to complex grammatical constraints. This differs from the concatenative morphology of many spoken languages, which except for suprasegmental features such as tone are tightly constrained by the sequential nature of voice sounds.\n\nASL does have a limited number of concatenative affixes. For example, the agentive suffix (similar to the English '-er') is made by placing two B or 5 hands in front of the torso, palms facing each other, and lowering them. On its own this sign means 'person'; in a compound sign following a verb, it is a suffix for the performer of the action, as in 'drive-er' and 'teach-er'. However, it cannot generally be used to translate English '-er', as it is used with a much more limited set of verbs. It is very similar to the '-ulo' suffix in Esperanto, meaning 'person' by itself and '-related person' when combined with other words.\n\nAn ASL prefix, (touching the chin), is used with number signs to indicate 'years old'. The prefix completely assimilates with the initial handshape of the number. For instance, 'fourteen' is signed with a B hand that bends several times at the knuckles. The chin-touch prefix in 'fourteen years old' is thus also made with a B hand. For 'three years old', however, the prefix is made with a 3 hand.\n\nRather than relying on sequential affixes, ASL makes heavy use of simultaneous modification of signs. One example of this is found in the aspectual system (see below); another is \"numeral incorporation:\" There are several families of two-handed signs which require one of the hands to take the handshape of a numeral. Many of these deal with time. For example, drawing the dominant hand lengthwise across the palm and fingers of a flat B hand indicates a number of weeks; the dominant hand takes the form of a numeral from one to nine to specify how many weeks. There are analogous signs for 'weeks ago' and 'weeks from now', etc., though in practice several of these signs are only found with the lower numerals.\n\nASL also has a system of classifiers which may be incorporated into signs. A fist may represent an inactive object such as a rock (this is the default or neutral classifier), a horizontal ILY hand may represent an aircraft, a horizontal 3 hand (thumb pointing up and slightly forward) a motor vehicle, an upright G hand a person on foot, an upright V hand a pair of people on foot, and so on through higher numbers of people. These classifiers are moved through sign space to iconically represent the actions of their referents. For example, an ILY hand may 'lift off' or 'land on' a horizontal B hand to sign an aircraft taking off or landing; a 3 hand may be brought down on a B hand to sign parking a car; and a G hand may be brought toward a V hand to represent one person approaching two.\n\nThe frequency of classifier use depends greatly on genre, occurring at a rate of 17.7% in narratives but only 1.1% in casual speech and 0.9% in formal speech.\n\nFrames are a morphological device that may be unique to sign languages (Liddell 2004). They are incomplete sets of the features which make up signs, and they combine with existing signs, absorbing features from them to form a derived sign. It is the frame which specifies the number and nature of segments in the resulting sign, while the basic signs it combines with lose all but one or two of their original features.\n\nOne, the frame, consists of a simple downward movement. It combines with the signs for the days of the week, which then lose their inherent movement. For example, 'Monday' consists of an M/O hand made with a circling movement. 'Monday' (that is, 'on Mondays') is therefore signed as an M/O hand that drops downward, but without the circling movement. A similar frame (a sideward pan) combines with times of the day, such as 'morning' and 'afternoon', which likewise keep their handshape and location but lose their original movement. Numeral incorporation (see above) also uses frames. However, in ASL frames are most productively utilized for verbal aspect.\n\nWhile there is no grammatical tense in ASL, there are numerous verbal aspects. These are produced by modulating the verb: Through reduplication, by placing the verb in an aspectual frame (see above), or with a combination of these means.\n\nAn example of an aspectual frame is the \"unrealized inceptive\" aspect ('just about to X'), illustrated here with the verb 'to tell'. 'To tell' is an indexical (directional) verb, where the index finger (a G hand) begins with a touch to the chin and then moves outward to point out the recipient of the telling. 'To be just about to tell' retains just the locus and the initial chin touch, which now becomes the final hold of the sign; all other features from the basic verb (in this case, the outward motion and pointing) are dropped and replaced by features from the frame (which are shared with the unrealized inceptive aspects of other verbs such as 'look at', 'wash the dishes', 'yell', 'flirt', etc.). These frame features are: Eye gaze toward the locus (which is no longer pointed at with the hand), an open jaw, and a hand (or hands, in the case of two-hand verbs) in front of the trunk which moves in an arc to the onset location of the basic verb (in this case, touching the chin), while the trunk rotates and the signer inhales, catching her breath during the final hold. The hand shape throughout the sign is whichever is required by the final hold, in this case a G hand.\n\nThe variety of aspects in ASL can be illustrated by the verb 'to be sick', which involves the middle finger of the Y/8 hand touching the forehead, and which can be modified by a large number of frames. Several of these involve reduplication, which may but need not be analyzed as part of the frame. (The appropriate non-manual features are not described here.)\n\nThese modulations readily combine with each other to create yet finer distinctions. Not all verbs take all aspects, and the forms they do take will not necessarily be completely analogous to the verb illustrated here. Conversely, not all aspects are possible with this one verb.\n\nAspect is unusual in ASL in that transitive verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for \"the dog chewed on a bone,\" or 'she look-at me' for \"she looked at me,\" you cannot do the same in the durative to mean \"the dog gnawed on the bone\" or \"she stared at me.\" Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.\n\nReduplication is also used for expressing verbal number. Verbal number indicates that the action of the verb is repeated; in the case of ASL it is apparently limited to transitive verbs, where the motion of the verb is either extended or repeated to cover multiple object or recipient loci. (Simple plurality of action can also be conveyed with reduplication, but without indexing any object loci; in fact, such aspectual forms do not allow objects, as noted above.) There are specific dual forms (and for some signers trial forms), as well as plurals. With dual objects, the motion of the verb may be made twice with one hand, or simultaneously with both; while with plurals the object loci may be taken as a group by using a single sweep of the signing hand while the verbal motion is being performed, or individuated by iterating the move across the sweep. For example, 'to ask someone a question' is signed by flexing the index finger of an upright G hand in the direction of that person; the dual involves flexing it at both object loci (sequentially with one hand or simultaneously with both), the simple plural involves a single flexing which spans the object group while the hand arcs across it, and the individuated plural involves multiple rapid flexings while the hand arcs. If the singular verb uses reduplication, that is lost in the dual and plural forms.\nThere are three types of personal name signs in ASL: arbitrary, descriptive, and finger-spelled. Once given, names are for life, apart from changing from one of the latter types to an arbitrary sign in childhood. Name signs are usually assigned by another member of the Deaf community, and signal inclusion in that community. Name signs are not used to address people, as names are in English, but are used only for third-person reference, and usually only when the person is absent.\n\nThe majority of people, probably well in excess of 90%, have arbitrary name signs. These are initialized signs: The hand shape is the initial of one of the English names of the person, usually the first. The sign may occur in neutral space, with a tremble; with a double-tap (as a noun) at one of a limited number of specific locations, such as the side of the chin, the temple, or the elbow; or moving across a location or between two locations, with a single tap at each. Single-location signs are simpler in connotation, like English \"Vee\"; double-location signs are fancier, like English \"Veronica\". Sam Supalla (1992) collected 525 simple arbitrary name signs like these.\n\nThere are two constraints on arbitrary signs. First, it should not mean anything. That is, it should not duplicate an existing ASL word. Second, there should not be more than one person with the name sign in the local community. If a person moves to a new community where someone already has their name sign, then the newcomer is obligated to modify theirs. This is usually accomplished by compounding the hand shape, so that the first tap of the sign takes the initial of the person's first English name, and the second tap takes the initial of their last name. There are potentially thousands of such compound-initial signs.\n\nDescriptive name signs are not initialized, but rather use ASL classifiers. They tend to be assigned and used by children, rather like \"Blinky\" in English. Parents do not give such names to their children, but most Deaf people do not have deaf parents and are assigned their name sign by classmates in their first school for the deaf. At most 10% of Deaf people retain such name signs into adulthood. Descriptive signs were perhaps more common when deaf education was first established: Clerc and T.H. Gallaudet all have descriptive name signs (though Clerc's was presumably his French Sign Language name). Arbitrary name signs became established very early in the history of ASL.\n\nThe two systems, arbitrary and descriptive, are sometimes combined, usually for humorous purposes. For example, U.S. President Richard Nixon may be signed by signing \"to lie\" with his initial, N, as the hand shape, effectively meaning \"Nixon the Liar\". Hearing people learning ASL are also often assigned combined name signs. This is not traditional for Deaf people.\n\nSometimes people with very short English names, such as \"Ann\" or \"Lee\", or ones that flow easily, such as \"Larry\", may never acquire a name sign, but may instead be referred to with finger-spelling.\n\nASL is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language. This default word order is sometimes altered by processes including topicalization and null elements; however, this is marked either with non-manual signals like eyebrow or body position, or with prosodic marking such as pausing. These non-manual grammatical markings (such as eyebrow movement or head-shaking) may optionally spread over the c-command domain of the node which it is attached to. However, ASL is a pro-drop language, and when the manual sign that a non-manual grammatical marking is attached to is omitted, the non-manual marking obligatorily spreads over the c-command domain.\n\nThe full sentence structure in ASL is [topic] [subject] verb [object] [subject-pronoun-tag]. Topics and \"tags\" are both indicated with non-manual features, and both give a great deal of flexibility to ASL word order. Within a noun phrase, the word order is noun-number and noun-adjective.\n\nASL does not have a copula (linking 'to be' verb). For example, \"my hair is wet\" is signed 'my hair wet', and \"my name is Pete\" may be signed '[name my] P-E-T-E'.\n\nIt has been claimed that tense in ASL is marked adverbially, and that ASL lacks a separate category of tense markers. However, Aarons et al. (1992, 1995) argue that \"Tense\" (T) is indeed a distinct category of syntactic head, and that the T node can be occupied either by a modal (e.g. SHOULD) or a lexical tense marker (e.g. FUTURE-TENSE). They support this claim by noting that only one such item can occupy the T slot:\n\nAspect may be marked either by verbal inflection or by separate lexical items.\n\nThese are ordered: Tense – Negation – Aspect – Verb:\n\nA topic sets off background information that will be discussed in the following main clause. Topic constructions are not often used in standard English, but they are common in some dialects, as in,\n\nTopicalization is used productively in ASL and often results in surface forms that do not follow the basic SVO word order. In order to non-manually mark topics, the eyebrows are raised and the head is tilted back during the production of a topic. The head is often lowered toward the end of the sign, and sometimes the sign is followed rapidly nodding the head. A slight pause follows the topic, setting it off from the rest of the sentence:\n\nAnother way topics may be signed is by shifting the body. The signer may use the space on one side of his/her body to sign the topic, and then shifts to the other side for the rest of the sentence.\n\nASL utterances do not require topics, but their use is extremely common. They are used for purposes of information flow, to set up referent loci (see above), and to supply objects for verbs which are grammatically prevented from taking objects themselves (see below).\n\nWithout a topic, \"the dog chased my cat\" is signed:\n\nHowever, people tend to want to set up the object of their concern first and then discuss what happened to it. In English, we do this with passive clauses: \"my cat was chased by the dog.\" In ASL, topics are used with similar effect:\n\nIf the word order of the main clause is changed, the meaning of the utterance also changes:\n\nThere are three types of non-manual topic markers, all of which involve raised eyebrows. The three types of non-manual topic markers are used with different types of topics and in different contexts, and the topic markings cannot spread over other elements in the utterance. Topics can be moved from and remain null in the main clause of an utterance, or topics can be base-generated and either be co-referential to either the subject or object in the main clause or be related to the subject of object by a semantic property.\n\nThe first type of non-manual marking, topic marking 1 (tm1), is only used with a moved topic. Tm1 is characterized by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and head tilted backwards. At the end of the sign the head moves down and there is a pause, often with an eye blink, before the sentence is continued. The following is an example of a context in which the tm1 marking is used:\n\nTopic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) are both used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is characterized by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and the head tilted backwards and to the side. Toward the end of the sign the head moves forward and to the opposite side, and there is a pause and often an eye blink before continuing. For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts tilted down and jerks up and down, the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a conversation to something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor. Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.\n\nAn example of a tm2 marking used with a topic related to the object of the main clause is:\n\nAn example of a tm2 marking used with a co-referential topic is:\n\nIX-3rd represents a 3rd person index.\n\nAnother example of a tm2 marking with a co-referential topic is:\n\nAn example of a tm3 topic marking is:\n\nASL sentences may have up to two marked topics. Possible combinations of topic types are two tm2 topics, two tm3 topics, tm2 preceding tm1, tm3 preceding tm1, and tm2 preceding tm3. Sentences with these topic combinations in the opposite orders or with two tm1 topics are considered ungrammatical by native signers.\n\nInformation may also be added after the main clause as a kind of 'afterthought'. In ASL this is commonly seen with subject pronouns. These are accompanied by a nod of the head, and make a statement more emphatic:\nversus\nThe subject need not be mentioned, as in\nversus\nAs noted above, in ASL aspectually marked verbs cannot take objects. To deal with this, the object must be known from context so that it does not need to be further specified. This is accomplished in two ways:\nOf these two strategies, the first is the more common. For \"my friend was typing her term paper all night\" to be used with a durative aspect, this would result in\n\nThe less colloquial topic construction may come out as,\n\nNegated clauses may be signaled by shaking the head during the entire clause. A topic, however, cannot be so negated; the headshake can only be produced during the production of the main clause. (A second type of negation starts with the verb and continues to the end of the clause.)\n\nIn addition, in many communities, negation is put at the end of the clause, unless there is a wh- question word. For example, the sentence, \"I thought the movie was not good,\" could be signed as, \"BEFORE MOVIE ME SEE, THINK WHAT? IT GOOD NOT.\"\n\nThere are two manual signs that negate a sentence, NOT and NONE, which are accompanied by a shake of the head. NONE is typically used when talking about possession:\n\nNOT negates a verb:\n\nThere are three types of questions with different types of constructions in ASL: wh- questions, yes/no questions, and rhetorical questions.\n\nWh- questions can be formed in a variety of ways. the wh- word can appear only at the end of the sentence, only at the beginning of the sentence, at both the beginning and end of the sentence, or in situ (i.ei where the wh- word is in the sentence structure before movement occurs). Manual wh- signs are also accompanied by a non-manual grammatical marking, which includes lowered or \"scrunchy\" eybrows, a slight frown, head and body tilted forwards, slightly rounded lips, and sometimes a sideways head-shake.\n\nThere is disagreement about whether wh-words move rightward or leftward in ASL. While some researchers argue for rightward movement in wh- questions, others, including Petronio and Lillo-Martin, have argued that ASL has leftward movement and wh- words that appear to the right of the clause move by other processes. Arguments for leftward movement are based on the facts that if wh- movement in ASL were rightward, ASL would be an exception to cross-linguistic generalizations that wh- movement is leftward and that wh- markers are not topics. Petronio and Lillo-Martin also demonstrate that the rightward-movement hypothesis allows utterances that native signers judge as ungrammatical but does not allow utterances that are considered grammatical. On the other hand, they show that the hypothesis that there is leftward wh- movement with other processes accounting for wh- elements appearing rightward accounts correctly for the same utterances that could not be explained by the rightward hypothesis.\nThis movement can also be observed in the object position. For example, while YESTERDAY must normally follow the object, it may precede the whq-word \"WHAT\":\n\nASL also has questions where the wh-word occurs twice, copied in final position:\n\nYes/no questions also require non-manual markings. Similar to the non-manual marking for wh- questions, the non-manual cue for yes/no questions include tilting the head and body forward. To distinguish the yes/no question marking from that of wh- questions, the yes/no arking also includes raised eyebrows and widened eyes as well as slightly pursed lips. Unlike wh- questions, yes/no questions do not involve a change of word order, and the non-manual marking must be used over the whole utterance in order for it to be judged as a statement opposed to a question.\n\nRaised eyebrows are also used for rhetorical questions which are not intended to elicit an answer. To distinguish the non-manual marking for rhetorical questions from that of yes/no questions, the body is in a neutral position opposed to tilted forward, and the head is tilted in a different way than in yes/no questions. Rhetorical questions are much more common in ASL than in English. For example, \"I don't like garlic\" may be signed,\n\nThis strategy is commonly used instead of signing the word 'because' for clarity or emphasis. For instance, \"I love to eat pasta because I am Italian\" would be signed,\n\nRelative clauses are signaled by tilting back the head and raising the eyebrows and upper lip. This is done during the performance of the entire clause. There is no change in word order. For example, \"the dog which recently chased the cat came home\" would be signed,\n\nwhere the brackets here indicate the duration of the non-manual features. If the sign 'recently' were made without these features, it would lie outside the relative clause, and the meaning would change to \"the dog which chased the cat recently came home\".\n\nIn ASL signers set up regions of space (loci) for specific referents (see above); these can then be referred to indexically by pointing at those locations with pronouns and indexical verbs.\n\nPersonal pronouns in ASL are indexic. That is, they point to their referent, or to a locus representing their referent. When the referent is physically present, pronouns involve simply pointing at the referent, with different handshapes for different pronominal uses: A 'G' handshape is a personal pronoun, an extended 'B' handshape with an outward palm orientation is a possessive pronoun, and an extended-thumb 'A' handshape is a reflexive pronoun; these may be combined with numeral signs to sign 'you two', 'us three', 'all of them', etc.\n\nIf the referent is not physically present, the speaker identifies the referent and then points to a location (the \"locus)\" in the sign space near their body. This locus can then be pointed at to refer to the referent. Theoretically, any number of loci may be set up, as long as the signer and recipient remember them all, but in practice, no more than eight loci are used.\n\nMeier 1990 demonstrates that only two grammatical persons are distinguished in ASL: First person and non-first person, as in Damin. Both persons come in several numbers as well as with signs such as 'my' and 'by myself'.\n\nMeier provides several arguments for believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when pointing to a person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There is nothing in the sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need \"you\" to go to the store and \"you\" to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.\n\nPersonal pronouns have separate forms for singular ('I' and 'you/(s)he') and plural ('we' and 'you/they'). These have possessive counterparts: 'my', 'our', 'your/his/her', 'your/their'. In addition, there are pronoun forms which incorporate numerals from two to five ('the three of us', 'the four of you/them', etc.), though the dual pronouns are slightly idiosyncratic in form \"(i.e.,\" they have a K rather than 2 handshape, and the wrist nods rather than circles). These numeral-incorporated pronouns have no possessive equivalents.\n\nAlso among the personal pronouns are the 'self' forms ('by myself', 'by your/themselves', etc.). These only occur in the singular and plural (there is no numeral incorporation), and are only found as subjects. They have derived emphatic and 'characterizing' forms, with modifications used for derivation rather like those for verbal aspect. The 'characterizing' pronoun is used when describing someone who has just been mentioned. It only occurs as a non-first-person singular form.\n\nFinally, there are formal pronouns used for honored guests. These occur as singular and plural in the non-first person, but only as singular in the first person.\n\nASL is a pro-drop language, which means that pronouns are not used when the referent is obvious from context and is not being emphasized.\n\nWithin ASL there is a class of indexical (often called 'directional') verbs. These include the signs for 'see', 'pay', 'give', 'show', 'invite', 'help', 'send', 'bite', etc. These verbs include an element of motion that indexes one or more referents, either physically present or set up through the referent locus system. If there are two loci, the first indicates the subject and the second the object, direct or indirect depending on the verb, reflecting the basic word order of ASL. For example, 'give' is a bi-indexical verb based on a flattened M/O handshape. For 'I give you', the hand moves from myself toward you; for 'you give me', it moves from you to me. 'See' is indicated with a V handshape. Two loci for a dog and a cat can be set up, with the sign moving between them to indicate 'the dog sees the cat' (if it starts at the locus for dog and moves toward the locus for cat) or 'the cat sees the dog' (with the motion in the opposite direction), or the V hand can circulate between both loci and myself to mean 'we (the dog, the cat, and myself) see each other'. The verb 'to be in pain' (index fingers pointed at each other and alkuately approaching and separating) is signed at the location of the pain (head for headache, cheek for toothache, abdomen for stomachache, etc.). This is normally done in relation to the signer's own body, regardless of the person feeling the pain, but may take also use the locus system, especially for body parts which are not normally part of the sign space, such as the leg. There are also spatial verbs such as put-up and put-below, which allow signers to specify where things are or how they moved them around.\n\nASL makes heavy use of time-sequenced ordering, meaning that events are signed in the order in which they occur. For example, for \"I was late to class last night because my boss handed me a huge stack of work after lunch yesterday,\" one would sign 'yesterday lunch finish, boss give-me work big-stack, night class late-me'. In stories, however, ordering is malleable, since one can choose to sequence the events either in the order in which they occurred or in the order in which one found out about them.\n\nIn addition to its basic topic–comment structure, ASL typically places an adjective after a noun, though it may occur before the noun for stylistic purposes. Numerals also occur after the noun, a very rare pattern among oral languages.\n\nAdverbs, however, occur before the verbs. Most of the time adverbs are simply the same sign as an adjective, distinguished by the context of the sentence.\n\nWhen the scope of the adverb is the entire clause, as in the case of time, it comes before the topic. This is the only thing which can appear before the topic in ASL: \"time–topic–comment.\"\n\nModal verbs come after the main verb of the clause:\n\nThere is no separate sign in ASL for the conjunction \"and\". Instead, multiple sentences or phrases are combined with a short pause between. Often, lists are specified with a listing and ordering technique, a simple version of which is to show the length of the list first with the nondominant hand, then to describe each element after pointing to the nondominant finger that represents it.\n\nThere is a manual sign for the conjunction \"or\", but the concept is usually signed nonmanually with a slight shoulder twist.\n\nThe manual sign for the conjunction \"but\" is similar to the sign for \"different\". It is more likely to be used in Pidgin Signed English than in ASL. Instead, shoulder shifts can be used, similar to \"or\" with appropriate facial expression.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1459535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1459535", "title": "Dissimilation", "text": "Dissimilation\n\nIn phonology, particularly within historical linguistics, dissimilation is a phenomenon whereby similar consonants or vowels in a word become less similar. For example, when a sound occurs before another in the middle of a word in rhotic dialects of English, the first tends to drop out, as in \"beserk\" for \"berserk,\" \"suprise\" for \"surprise,\" \"paticular\" for \"particular\", and \"govenor\" for \"governor\" – this does not affect the pronunciation of \"government,\" which has only one , but English \"government\" tends to be pronounced \"goverment\", dropping out the first n.\n\nAn example where a relatively old case of phonetic dissimilation has been artificially undone in the spelling is English \"colonel\", whose standard pronunciation is (with the r sound) in North-American English, or in RP. It was formerly spelt \"coronel\" and is a borrowing from French \"coronnel\", which arose as a result of dissimilation from Italian \"colonnello\".\n\nThere are several hypotheses on the cause of dissimilation. According to John Ohala, listeners are confused by sounds with long-distance acoustic effects. In the case of English , rhoticization spreads across much of the word: in rapid speech, many of the vowels may sound as if they had an \"r\". It may be difficult to tell whether a word has one source of rhoticity or two. When there are two, a listener might wrongly interpret one as an acoustic effect of the other, and so mentally filter it out.\n\nThis factoring out of coarticulatory effects has been experimentally replicated. For example, Greek \"pakhu-\" (παχυ-) \"thick\" derives from an earlier \"*phakhu-.\" When test subjects are asked to say the \"*phakhu-\" form in casual speech, the aspiration from both consonants pervades both syllables, making the vowels breathy. Listeners hear a single effect, breathy voiced vowels, and attribute it to one rather than both of the consonants, as they assume the breathiness on the other syllable to be a long-distance coarticulatory effect, thus replicating the historical change in the Greek word.\n\nIf Ohala is correct, one might expect to find dissimilation in other languages with other sounds that frequently cause long-distance effects, such as nasalization and pharyngealization.\n\nIn English \"r\"-deletion, when a syllable is unstressed it may drop out altogether, as in \"deteriate\" for \"deteriorate\" and \"tempature\" for \"temperature,\" a process called haplology. When the is found in , it may change to : \"Febyuary\" for \"February,\" \"defibyulator\" for \"defibrillator,\" though this may be due to analogy with similar words, such as \"January\" and \"calculator\" (compare \"nucular\", which may have arisen through an analogous process).\n\nDissimilation, like assimilation, may involve a change in pronunciation relative to a segment that is adjacent to the affected segment or at a distance, and may involve a change relative to a preceding or a following segment. As with assimilation, anticipatory dissimilation is much more common than lag dissimilation, but unlike assimilation, most dissimilation is triggered by \"non\"-contiguous segments. Also, while many kinds of assimilation have the character of a sound law, few dissimilations do; most are in the nature of accidents that befall a particular lexical item.\n\nAnticipatory dissimilation at a distance (by far the most common):\n\nAnticipatory dissimilation from a contiguous segment (very rare):\n\nLag dissimilation at a distance (fairly common):\n\nLag dissimilation from a contiguous segment (very rare):\n\nWhen, through sound change, elements of a grammatical paradigm start to conflate in a way that is not easily remedied through re-wording, the forms may dissimilate. For example, in modern Korean the vowels and are merging for many people in the capital Seoul, and concurrently the second-person pronoun 네 'you' is shifting to 니 to avoid confusion with the first-person pronoun 내 'me'.\n\nSimilarly, it appears that English \"she,\" historically \"heo\", may have acquired its modern \"sh\" form through dissimilation from \"he\", though it is not clear whether the mechanism was idiosyncratic sound change (palatalization) of \"heo\", or substitution of \"heo\" with the feminine demonstrative pronoun \"seo\".\n\n\n"}

The face value of coins, stamps, or bill is usually its legal value. However, their market value need not bear any relationship to the face value. For example, some rare coins or stamps may be traded at prices considerably above their face value.\n\nThe face value of bonds usually represents the principal or redemption value. Interest payments are expressed as a percentage of face value. Before maturity, the actual value of a bond may be greater or less than face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, actual value approaches face value.\n\nIn the case of stock certificates, face value is the par value of the stock. In the case of common stock, par value is largely symbolic. In the case of preferred stock, dividends may be expressed as a percentage of par value.\n\nThe face value of a life insurance policy is the death benefit. In the case of so-called \"double indemnity\" life insurance policies, the beneficiary receives double the face value in case of accidental death.\n\nThe face value of property, casualty or health insurance policies is the maximum amount payable, as stated on the policy's face or declarations page.\n\nFace value can be used to refer to the apparent value of something other than a financial instrument, such as a concept or plan.

The practice of re-selling tickets for more than face value (or a certain amount above face value) is commonly known as ticket scalping. \n\n\"Taking someone at face value\" is assuming another person's suggestion, offer, or proposal is sincere, rather than a bargaining ploy.\n\n\n"}

Galley proofs may be uncut and unbound, or in some cases electronically transmitted. They are created for proofreading and copyediting purposes, but may also be used for promotional and review purposes.\n\nProof, in the typographical sense, is a term that dates from c. 1600. The primary goal of proofing is to create a tool for verification that the job is accurate. All needed or suggested changes are physically marked on paper proofs or electronically marked on electronic proofs by the author, editor, and proofreaders. The compositor, typesetter, or printer receives the edited copies, corrects and re-arranges the type or the pagination, and arranges for the press workers to print the final or published copies.\n\nGalley proofs or galleys are so named because in the days of hand-set letterpress printing in the 1650s, the printer would set the page into galleys, namely the metal trays into which type was laid and tightened into place. A small proof press would then be used to print a limited number of copies for proofreading. Galley proofs are thus, historically speaking, galleys printed on a proof press. \n\nFrom the printer's point of view, the galley proof, as it originated during the era of hand-set physical type, had two primary purposes, those being to check that the compositor had set the copy accurately (because sometimes individual pieces of type did get put in the wrong case after use) and that the type was free of defects (because type metal is comparatively soft, so type can get damaged). \n\nOnce a defect-free galley proof was produced, the publishing house requested a number of galley proofs to be run off for distribution to editors and authors for a final reading and corrections to the text before the type was fixed in the chase for printing.\n\nAn uncorrected proof is a proof version (on paper or in digital form) which is yet to receive final author and publisher approval. The term may also appear on the covers of advance reading copies; see below.\n\nThese days, because much typesetting and pre-press work is conducted digitally and transmitted electronically, the term uncorrected proof is more common than the older term galley proof, which refers exclusively to a paper proofing system. However, if a paper print-out of an uncorrected proof is made on a desk-top printer or copy machine and used as a paper proof for authorial or editorial mark-up, it approximates a galley proof, and it may be referred to as a galley. \nPreliminary electronic proof versions are also sometimes called digital proofs, pdf proofs, and pre-fascicle proofs, the last because they are viewed as single pages, not as they will look when gathered into fascicles or signatures for the press.\n\nProofs created by the printer for approval by the publisher before going to press are called final proofs. At this stage in production, all mistakes are supposed to have been corrected and the pages are set up in imposition for folding and cutting on the press. To correct a mistake at this stage entails an extra cost per page, so authors are discouraged from making many changes to final proofs, while last-minute corrections by the in-house publishing staff may be accepted. \n\nIn the final proof stage, page layouts are examined closely. Additionally, because final page proofs contain the final pagination, if an index was not compiled at an earlier stage in production, this pagination facilitates compiling a book's index and correcting its table of contents.\n\nHistorically, some publishers have used paper galley proofs as advance copies or advance reading copies (ARCs) or as pre-publication publicity proofs. These are provided to reviewers, magazines, and libraries in advance of final publication. These galleys are not sent out for correction, but to ensure timely reviews of newly published works. The list of recipients designated by the publisher limits the number of copies to only what is required, making advance copies a form of print-on-demand (POD) publication. \n\nPre-publication publicity proofs are normally gathered and bound in paper, but in the case of books with four-color printed illustrations, publicity proofs may be lacking illustrations or have them in black and white only. They may be marked or stamped on the cover \"uncorrected proof,\" but the recipient is not expected to proofread them, merely to overlook any minor errors of typesetting. \n\nGalley proofs in electronic form are rarely used as advance reading copies due to the possibility of a recipient editing the proof and issuing it as their own. However, trusted colleagues are occasionally offered electronic advance reading copies, especially if the publisher wishes to quickly typeset a page or two of \"advance praise\" notices within the book itself. \n\n"}

These languages also have their own regional and local dialects. Based on mutual intelligibility, Dalby counts seven \"outer\" languages, or language groups: Galician-Portuguese, Spanish, Astur-Leonese, \"Wider\"-Aragonese, \"Wider\"-Catalan, Provençal+Lengadocian, and \"Wider\"-Gascon.\n\nIn addition to those languages, there are a number of Portuguese-based creole languages and Spanish-based creole languages, for instance Papiamento.\n\nLike all Romance languages, the Iberian Romance languages descend from Vulgar Latin. Vulgar Latin was the nonstandard (in contrast to Classical Latin) form of the Latin language spoken by soldiers and merchants throughout the Roman Empire. With the expansion of the empire, Vulgar Latin came to be spoken by inhabitants of the various Roman-controlled territories. Latin and its descendants have been spoken in Iberia since the Punic Wars, when the Romans conquered the territory (see Roman conquest of Hispania).\n\nThe modern Iberian Romance languages were formed roughly through the following process:\n\nThis list points to common traits of these Iberian subsets, especially when compared to the other Romance languages in general. Thus, changes such as Catalan and Portuguese vuit and oito vs. Spanish ocho are not shown here, as the change -it- > -ch- is exclusive to Spanish among the Romance languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitically (not linguistically), there are four major officially recognised Iberian Romance languages:\n\nAdditionally, the Asturian language, although not an official language, is recognised by the autonomous community of Asturias. In Portugal, Mirandese, which, like Asturian, is one of the Astur-Leonese languages, has official status in the northernmost part of the country.\n\nThe Iberian Romance languages are a conventional group of Romance languages. Many authors use the term in a geographical sense although they are not necessarily a phylogenetic group (the languages grouped as Iberian Romance may not all directly descend from a common ancestor). Phylogenetically, there is disagreement about what languages should be considered within the Iberian Romance group; for example, some authors consider that East Iberian, also called Occitano-Romance, could be more closely related to languages of northern Italy (or also Franco-Provençal, the langues d'oïl and Rhaeto-Romance).

{"id": "75469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75469", "title": "Ideology", "text": "Ideology\n\nAn ideology is a collection of normative beliefs and values that an individual or group holds for other than purely epistemic reasons.\n\nThe term was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy in 1796, who conceived it as the \"science of ideas\". In contemporary philosophy it is narrower in scope than that original concept, or the ideas expressed in broad concepts such as \"worldview\", \"imaginary\" and \"ontology\".\n\nIn the political world, for instance, there are many well-known political ideologies, which cover a wide range of human interests.\n\nIn the sense defined by French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, ideology is \"the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence\".\n\nThe term \"ideology\" was born during the Reign of Terror of French Revolution, and acquired several other meanings thereafter.\n\nThe word, and the system of ideas associated with it, was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy in 1796, while he was in prison pending trial during the Terror. The word was created by assembling the words \"idea\", from Greek (near to the Lockean sense) and \"-logy\", from .\n\nThe coup that overthrew Maximilien Robespierre allowed Tracy to pursue his work.\n\nTracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him. He devised the term for a \"science of ideas\" he hoped would form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences. He based the word on two things: 1) sensations people experience as they interact with the material world; and 2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived \"Ideology\" as a liberal philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property, free markets, and constitutional limits on state power. He argues that among these aspects ideology is the most generic term, because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.\n\nTracy worked this out during the Napoleonic regime, and Napoleon Bonaparte came to view 'Ideology' a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's Institut National. According to Karl Mannheim's historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as \"the ideologues\". Karl Marx adopted this negative sense of the term and used it in his writings (he described Tracy as a \"fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär\", a fishblooded bourgeois doctrinaire).\n\nTracy's major book, \"The Elements of Ideology\", was soon translated into the major languages of Europe, and in the next generation, when post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as \"liberals\" and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s (these included the Carlist rebels in Spain, the Carbonari societies in France and Italy, and the Decembrists in Russia).\n\nIn the century after Tracy, the term ideology moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations.\n\nThe term \"ideology\" has dropped some of its pejorative sting, and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups. While Karl Marx situated the term within class struggle and domination, others believed it was a necessary part of institutional functioning and social integration.\n\nThere has been considerable analysis of different ideological patterns. Some have described this kind of analysis as \"meta-ideology\"—the study of the structure, form, and manifestation of ideologies. Recent analysis tends to posit that ideology is a \"coherent system of ideas\" that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Ideas become ideologies (that is, become coherent, repeated patterns) through the subjective ongoing choices that people make, serving as the seed around which further thought grows. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong. Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief.\n\nThis accords with definitions, such as by Manfred Steger and Paul James, that emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:\n\nThe works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, done under the heading of systematic ideology, are attempts to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. Charles Blattberg offers an account that distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies.\n\nDavid W. Minar describes six different ways the word \"ideology\" has been used:\n\nFor Willard A. Mullins an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of \"utopia\" and \"historical myth\". An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:\n\nTerry Eagleton outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:\n\nThe German philosopher Christian Duncker called for a \"critical reflection of the ideology concept\" (2006). In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of epistemology and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.\n\nThere are many different kinds of ideologies: political, social, epistemological, and ethical.\n\nIn the Marxist economic base and superstructure model of society, \"base\" denotes the relations of production and modes of production, and \"superstructure\" denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a feudal mode of production, religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as liberalism and social democracy dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via false consciousness.\n\nSome explanations have been presented. György Lukács proposes ideology as a projection of the class consciousness of the ruling class. Antonio Gramsci uses cultural hegemony to explain why the working-class have a false ideological conception of what are their best interests. Marx argued that \"The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production.\"\n\nThe Marxist formulation of \"ideology as an instrument of social reproduction\" is conceptually important to the sociology of knowledge, viz. Karl Mannheim, Daniel Bell, and Jürgen Habermas et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the \"total\" but \"special\" Marxist conception of ideology to a \"general\" and \"total\" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including Marxism) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. Slavoj Žižek and the earlier Frankfurt School added to the \"general theory\" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also unconscious ideas.\n\nLouis Althusser proposed both spiritual and materialistic conception of ideology, which made use of a special type of discourse: the lacunar discourse. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is \"not\" told (but is suggested).\n\nFor example, the statement \"All are equal before the law,\" which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal \"opportunities\". This is not true, for the concept of private property and power over the means of production results in some people being able to own more (\"much\" more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.\n\nAlthusser also proffered the concept of the ideological state apparatus to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was \"\"ideology has no history\": while individual ideolog\"ies\" have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.\n\nFor Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that \"ideas are material\"\" is illustrated by the \"scandalous advice\" of Pascal toward unbelievers: \"Kneel and pray, and then you will believe.\" What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious \"minds\" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more critical thinking.\n\nThe French Marxist theorist Guy Debord, founding member of the Situationist International, argued that when the commodity becomes the \"essential category\" of society, i.e. when the process of commodification has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of exchange value), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, The Society of the Spectacle.\n\nThe German cultural historian Silvio Vietta described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onwards as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the \"just war\", the \"true religion\", racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of heaven on earth in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the \"political religions\" (Eric Voegelin), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism.\n\nThe American philosopher Eric Hoffer identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:\n1) Hatred: \"Mass movements can rise and spread without a God, but never without belief in a devil.\". The \"ideal devil\" is a foreigner.\n\n2) Imitation: \"The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves, the greater is our desire to be like others ... the more we mistrust our judgment and luck, the more are we ready to follow the example of others.\"\n\n3) Persuasion: The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from \"a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have.\"\n\n4) Coercion: Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent. People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing. \"It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice.\"\n\n5) Leadership: Without the leader, there is no movement. Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe. He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future. The skills required include: audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses and a group of able lieutenants. Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, \"a single-minded fashioning after a model.\" He will not lead followers towards the \"promised land,\" but only \"away from their unwanted selves.\"\n\n6) Action: Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry.\n\n7) Suspicion: \"There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched.\" This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent.\n\nRonald Inglehart of the University of Michigan is author of the World Values Survey, which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.\n\nIn social studies, a political ideology is a certain ethical set of ideals, principles, doctrines, myths, or symbols of a social movement, institution, class, or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, education, health care, labor law, criminal law, the justice system, the provision of social security and social welfare, trade, the environment, minors, immigration, race, use of the military, patriotism, and established religion.\n\nPolitical ideologies have two dimensions:\n\nThere are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific political spectrum. Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum (such as the left, the center or the right), though precision in this respect can very often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g., populism) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. legalization of marijuana). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as \"the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition\".\n\nA political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best form of government (e.g., democracy, demagogy, theocracy, caliphate etc.), and the best economic system (e.g. capitalism, socialism, etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, \"socialism\" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system.\n\nStudies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of systematic ideology.\n\nPost 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age, in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated with Francis Fukuyama's writings on \"the end of history\". On the other hand, Nienhueser sees research (in the field of human resource management) as ongoingly \"generating ideology\".\n\nSlavoj Zizek has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this \"a post-modernist trap\". Peter Sloterdijk advanced the same idea already in 1988.\n\nThere are several studies that show that affinity to a specific political ideology is heritable.\n\nWhen a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government, one can speak of an ideocracy. Different forms of government utilize ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order.\n\n\"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back\", said John Maynard Keynes. How do ideologies become part of government policy?\nIn \"The Anatomy of Revolution\", Crane Brinton said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with the old regime. Extremists such as Lenin and Robespierre will overcome more moderate revolutionaries. This stage is soon followed by Thermidor, a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like Stalin and Napoleon Bonaparte who bring \"normalcy and equilibrium\".\nA very similar sequence (\"men of ideas>fanatics>practical men of action\") occurs in Eric Hoffer, The True Believer, and Brinton's sequence is reiterated by J. William Fulbright.\nThe revolution thus becomes established as an Ideocracy, but its rise is likely to be checked by a Political midlife crisis.\n\nEven when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant paradigm or mindset can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced.\n\nA special case of science adopted as ideology is that of ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. Perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of self-awareness and cognition itself. Linguist George Lakoff has proposed a cognitive science of mathematics wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception—which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.\n\nDeep ecology and the modern ecology movement (and, to a lesser degree, Green parties) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.\n\nSome accuse ecological economics of likewise turning scientific theory into political economy, although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of green economics fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.\n\nThis is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include neoliberalism, monetarism, mercantilism, mixed economy, social Darwinism, communism, laissez-faire economics, and free trade. There are also current theories of safe trade and fair trade that can be seen as ideologies.\n\nPsychological research increasingly suggests that ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking. Jost, Ledgerwood and Hardin proposed in 2008 that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships. These authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of system-justifying worldviews. Psychologists have generally found that personality traits, individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have a common thread.\n\nAccording to the semiotician Bob Hodge, ideology \"identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. Foucault's 'episteme' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life.\" Authors such as Michael Freeden have also recently incorporated a semantic analysis to the study of ideologies.\n\nSociologists define ideology as \"cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality.\" Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group's social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society's symbol system to organize social relations in a hierarchy, with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society's major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion. As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality.\n\nSociological examples of ideologies include: racism; sexism; heterosexism; ableism; and ethnocentrism.\n\n\n\n"}

It is expanding in numbers as the Iraqw people absorb neighbouring ethnic groups. The language has a large number of Datooga loanwords, especially in poetic language. The Gorowa language to the south shares numerous similarities and is sometimes considered a dialect.\n\nWhiteley (1958) lists the following vowel phonemes for Iraqw. All of the vowels except /ə/ occur in both short and long versions:\n\nWhiteley (1958) and Mous (1993) list the following consonants:\nIn the popular orthography for Iraqw used in Lutheran and Catholic materials, the sound is spelled and is spelled (Mous 1993:16).\n\nNouns in Iraqw have three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The gender of a noun can be deduced from the type of agreement that it triggers on other elements in the sentence, but the agreement system is unusual, and obeys the following principle (Mous 1993:41):\n\n\nThe masculine, feminine, and plural forms of the verb are identified by the form the verb takes when the subject is pronoun which is a.) a third person masculine singular ('he'), b.) a third person feminine singular ('she'), or c.) a third person plural ('they').\n\nThere are several unusual things that are worth noting. One is that 'tail' is neuter in the singular and feminine in the plural; despite this, the plural verb form is used for 'tail', since it is neuter, and neuters use the plural verb form. Another is that the verbs do not agree with their subjects in number, so the masculine plural \"daaqay\" 'boys' takes the masculine form of the verb, not the plural form of the verb.\n\nNouns typically have separate singular and plural forms, but there are a large number of distinct plural suffixes. Mous (1993:44) reports that there are fourteen different plural suffixes. The lexical entry for a noun must specify the particular plural suffix it takes.\n\nThe gender of a plural noun is usually different from the gender of the corresponding singular. Compare the following singular and plural nouns, with their genders:\n\nWhile it is not possible to predict the gender of a noun or which plural suffix it will take, the form of the plural suffix determines the gender of the plural noun. So, for example, all plural nouns with the /-eemo/ suffix are neuter (Mous 1993:58).\n\nThe gender of a noun is important for predicting the construct case suffix and the gender linker that it will use. When a noun is directly followed by\nthen a construct case suffix must appear after the noun. The construct case marker is /-ú/ or /-kú/ for masculine nouns; /-r/ or /-tá/ for feminine nouns; and /-á/ for neuter nouns (Mous 1993:95-96):\n\nThe gender linkers are similar to the construct cases suffixes, but appear between the noun and other suffixes (such as the demonstrative, indefinite, and possessive suffixes). The following example shows masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns before the 'their' possessive suffix and the demonstrative -qá' 'that (far, but visible)' (Mous 1993:90-92)\n\nThe noun comes first in the noun phrase, and precedes possessors, adjectives, numerals, and relative clauses. An element called the construct case suffix appears between the noun and these modifiers, as discussed in the Morphology section above:\n\nAn Iraqw sentence contains a verb in final position, and an auxiliary-like element called the 'selector'. Either the subject or the object of the sentence may precede the selector (Mous 2004:110), and the selector agrees with the preceding noun. So in the first example below, \"iri\" shows agreement with \"/ameenirdá' \" 'that woman', and in the second example, \"uná\" shows agreement with \"gitladá' \":\n\n\n"}

According to Westermann (1952) it was used by Europeans to denote a number of tribes speaking related dialects. Marchese (1989) notes the fact that many of these peoples were recruited as \"crew\" by European seafarers; \"the homonymy with crew is obvious, and is at least one source of the confusion among Europeans that there was a Kru/crew tribe\" \n\nAndrew Dalby noted the historical importance of the Kru languages for their position at the crossroads of African-European interaction. He wrote that \"Kru and associated languages were among the first to be encountered by European voyagers on what was then known as the Pepper Coast, a centre of the production and export of Guinea and melegueta pepper; a once staple African seaborne trade\". The Kru languages are known for some of the most complex tone systems in Africa, rivaled perhaps only by the Omotic languages.\n\nRecent documentation has noted \"Kru societies can now be found along the coast of Monrovia, Liberia to Bandama River in Côte d'Ivoire\". \"Villages maintain their ties based on presumed common descent, reinforced by ceremonial exchanges and gifts\". The Kru people and their languages, although now many speak English (in Liberia) or French (in Côte d'Ivoire) as a second language, are said to be \"dominant in the southwest region where the forest zone reaches the coastal lagoons\". The Kru people rely on the forest for farming, supplemented by hunting for their livelihood. In 2010, Kru and associated languages were spoken by 95 percent of the approximately 3.5 million people in Liberia.\n\nThe Kru languages include many subgroups such as Kuwaa, Grebo, Belle, Belleh, Kwaa and many others. According to Breitbonde, categorization of communities based on cultural distinctiveness, historical or ethnic identity, and socio-political autonomy \"may have brought about the large number of distinct Kru dialects; \"Although the natives were in many respects similar in type and tribe, every village was an independent state; there was also very little intercommunication\". Breitbonde notes the Kru people were categorized based on their cultural distinctiveness, separate historical or ethnic identities, and social and political autonomy. This is the possible reason for so many subgroups of the Kru language. As noted by Fisiak, there is very little documentation on the Kru and associated languages.\n\nThe Marchese (1989) classification of Kru languages is as follows. Many of these languages are dialect clusters and are sometimes considered more than a single language.\n\"Ethnologue\" adds Neyo, which may be closest to Dida or Godie.\n\n\n"}

The vocabulary of Indonesian borrows heavily from regional languages of Indonesia, such as Javanese, Sundanese and Minangkabau, as well as from Dutch, Sanskrit and Arabic. \n\nThe Indonesian language is primarily used in commerce, administration, education and the media. Most Indonesians speak other languages, such as Javanese, as their first language. Most books printed in Indonesia are written in the Indonesian language.\n\nSince Indonesia recognises only a single official language, other languages are not recognised either at the national level or the regional level, thus making Javanese the most widely spoken language without official status, with Sundanese the second in the list (excluding Chinese varieties).\n\nBelow is a chart of several Indonesian languages. Most of them belong to Austronesian languages family. While there have been misunderstandings on which ones should be classified as \"languages\" and which ones should be classified as \"dialects\", the chart confirms that most have similarities, yet are not mutually comprehensible. These languages are arranged according to the numbers of native speakers.\n\nThere are 726 languages spoken across the Indonesian archipelago in 2009 (dropped from 742 languages in 2007), the largest multilingual population in the world only after Papua New Guinea. Indonesian Papua, which is adjacent to Papua New Guinea, has the most languages in Indonesia.

The hare was 'the big-eared fellow', and the rabbit ‘pomet’, and the rat ‘sacote’, and the cat ‘scratcher'\". In the modern superstition, the taboo only applies to the rat, and the term 'sacote' is no longer used. \nAlthough this particular sea-taboo was one amongst many and was not held to apply on land, it has become a popular modern belief that the word is somehow unlucky and the taboo has been adopted by some as a typical Manx practice, despite the fact that the old Manx had no qualms in using the word, or its Manx equivalent, \"roddan\". In modern times, even non-local and unsuperstitious people will refrain from using the word \"rat\" perhaps in an effort to fit in with those who take it seriously, or in an attempt to be folksy.\n\nLocal socially acceptable alternatives for the superstitious also include \"joey\", \"ringie\", \"queerfella\", \"iron fella\" and .

The term is taken from the Roman lustratio purification rituals.\n\nAfter the fall of the various European Communist governments in 1989–1991, the term came to refer to government-sanctioned policies of \"mass disqualification of those associated with the abuses under the prior regime\". Procedures excluded participation of former communists, and especially of informants of the communist secret police, in successor political positions, or even in civil service positions. This exclusion formed part of the wider decommunization campaigns. In some countries, however, lustration laws did not lead to exclusion and disqualification. Lustration law in Hungary (1994–2003) was based on the exposure of compromised state officials, while lustration law in Poland (1999–2005) depended on confession.\n\nLustration law \"is a special public employment law that regulates the process of examining whether a person holding certain higher public positions worked or collaborated with the repressive apparatus of the communist regime\". The \"special\" nature of lustration law refers to its transitional character. \nAs of 1996, various lustration laws of varying scope were implemented in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia), Germany, Poland, and Romania. As of 1996 lustration laws had not been passed in Belarus, nor in former Yugoslavia or the former Soviet Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) (Ellis, 1996).\n\nLustration can serve as a form of punishment by anti-communist politicians who were dissidents under a Communist-led government. Lustration laws are usually passed right before elections, and become tightened when right-wing governments are in power, and loosened while social democratic parties are in power. It is claimed that lustration systems based on dismissal or confession might be able to increase trust in government, while those based on confession might be able to promote social reconciliation.\n\nUnlike many neighbouring states, the new government in the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic did not adjudicate under court trials, but instead took a non-judicial approach to ensure changes would be implemented.\n\nAccording to a law passed on 4 October 1991, all employees of the StB, the Communist-era secret police, were blacklisted from designated public offices, including the upper levels of the civil service, the judiciary, procuracy, Security Information Service (BIS), army positions, management of state owned enterprises, the central bank, the railways, senior academic positions and the public electronic media. This law remained in place in the Czech Republic after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and expired in 2000.\n\nThe lustration laws in Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic were not intended to serve as justice, but to ensure that events such as the Communist coup of February 1948 did not happen again.\n\nGermany did not have a lustration process, but it has a federal agency, known as the Stasi Records Agency, dedicated to preserving and protecting the archives and investigating the past actions of the former East German secret police, the Stasi. The agency is subordinate to the Representative of the Federal Government for Culture (Bernd Neumann, CDU). As of 2012, it had 1,708 employees.\n\nThe first lustration bill was passed by the Polish Parliament in 1992, but it was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland. Several other projects were then submitted and reviewed by a dedicated commission, resulting in a new lustration law passed in 1996. From 1997 to 2007 lustration was dealt with by the office of the Public Interest Spokesperson (), who analyzed lustration declarations and could initiate further proceedings. According to a new law which came into effect on 15 March 2007, lustration in Poland is now administered by the Institute of National Remembrance (; IPN).\n\nIn Ukraine, the term lustration refers to the exclusion from public office of civil servants who worked under Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych for more than a year \"and did not resign of their own accord\" between 25 February 2010 and 22 February 2014 and civil servants who were active in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They may be excluded for five to ten years.\n\nLustration has been compared to denazification in post-World War II Europe, and the de-Ba'athification in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.\n\n\n"}

His primary interests include philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, metaphysics and epistemology. His current work involves the philosophy of linguistics, foundational issues in semantics, the semantics of definite descriptions and demonstratives, semantic externalism, and scientific realism.\n\nHe is a noted proponent of the causal theory of reference. He claims that repeated groundings in an object can account for reference change. However, such a response leaves open the problem of cognitive significance that originally intrigued Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege.\n\nMichael Devitt, along with Georges Rey, is also a critic of the transcendental argument against eliminativism, and defends this position against claims that it is self-refuting by invoking deflationary semantic theories that avoid analysing predicates like \"x is true\" as expressing a real property. They are construed, instead, as logical devices so that asserting that a sentence is true is just a quoted way of asserting the sentence itself. To say, \"'God exists' is true\" is just to say, \"God exists\". This way, Rey and Devitt argue, in so far as dispositional replacements of \"claims\" and deflationary accounts of \"true\" are coherent, eliminativism is not self-refuting.\n\nDevitt is a known critic of constructivist epistemology.\n\nDevitt's secondary education (1952–1957) was at Bradfield College in Berkshire, England, where he completed 3 \"A\" Levels and 9 \"O\" Levels. He then studied at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia between 1958–1961, taking his qualifying exam at the end of that time.\n\nHis higher education began at the University of Sydney in 1962, where he studied philosophy and psychology. He graduated in 1966 with First Class Honours and a University Medal in philosophy. He continued on as a post-graduate research student until 1967, when he moved to Harvard University and studied under Quine. He received his MA in 1970 and his PhD in 1972.\n\nFollowing the completion of his coursework at Harvard, Michael Devitt returned to Sydney in 1971 and began his teaching career as a lecturer in the Philosophy department. He was prominent in the 'Sydney philosophy disturbances'. He was made a senior lecturer in 1977 and Associate Professor in 1982, and by 1985 was named as Head of Department of Traditional and Modern Philosophy. He continued teaching at the University of Sydney until 1987, after which he returned to the United States and accepted an appointment of Professor of Philosophy at the University of Maryland in 1988. He remained in Maryland until 1999, when he became a Professor (later Distinguished Professor) at the CUNY Graduate Center. There he served as the Executive Officer of the Philosophy Program from 1999–2002. He continues to teach there as a Distinguished Professor as of 2012.\n\nIn addition to his tenured or tenure-track positions, Michael Devitt has held numerous non-tenured positions at the University of Nottingham, Macquarie University, Australian National University, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Michigan, University of Southern California, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Harvard University, and Sydney University’s Women’s College.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6539290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6539290", "title": "Old Dutch", "text": "Old Dutch\n\nIn linguistics, Old Dutch or Old Low Franconian is the set of Franconian dialects (i.e. dialects that evolved from Frankish) spoken in the Low Countries during the Early Middle Ages, from around the 5th to the 12th century. Old Dutch is mostly recorded on fragmentary relics, and words have been reconstructed from Middle Dutch and Old Dutch loanwords in French. \n\nOld Dutch is regarded as the primary stage in the development of a separate Dutch language. However, as the modern Dutch borders do not reflect any special delimitation of the continental West-Germanic dialect continuum during the Old Dutch period, in which no standard languages yet existed, some linguists prefer to avoid the term \"Old Dutch\" altogether and speak solely of Old Low Franconian. It was spoken by the descendants of the Salian Franks who occupied what is now the southern Netherlands, northern Belgium, part of northern France, and parts of the Lower Rhine regions of Germany. It evolved into Middle Dutch around the 12th century. The inhabitants of northern Dutch provinces, including Groningen, Friesland and the coast of North Holland, spoke Old Frisian, and some in the east (Achterhoek, Overijssel and Drenthe) spoke Old Saxon.\n\nBefore the advent of Old Dutch or any of the Germanic languages, Germanic dialects were mutually intelligible. The North Sea Germanic dialects were spoken in the whole of the coastal parts of the Netherlands and Belgium. Old Frisian was one of these dialects, and elements of it survived through the Frisian language, spoken in the province of Friesland in the North of the Netherlands. In the rest of the coastal region these dialects were mostly displaced following the withdrawal to England of the migrating Angles, Saxons and Jutes, who gave rise to Old English. \n\nIt was largely replaced by Weser-Rhine Germanic dialects, spoken by the Salian Franks. It spread from northern Belgium and the southern Netherlands to the coast and evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch. It has, however, a North sea Germanic substrate, which is why some philologists put the language in that branch. Linguists typically date this transition to around the 5th century.\n\nOld Dutch is divided in Old West Low Franconian and Old East Low Franconian (Limburgian), however, these varieties are very closely related. The divergence being that the latter shares more traits with neighboring historical forms of Central Franconian dialects such as Ripuarian and Moselle Franconian. While both forms of Low Franconian were instrumental to the framing of Middle Dutch, Old East Low Franconian did not contribute much to Standard Dutch, which is based on the consolidated dialects of Holland and Brabant.\n\nDuring the Merovingian period, the Central Franconian dialects were influenced by Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch), resulting in certain linguistic loans which yielded a slight overlap of vocabulary, most of which relates to warfare. In addition is the subsumption of the High German consonant shift, a set of phonological changes beginning around the 5th or 6th century that partially influenced Old Dutch, and extensively influenced Central Franconian and other Old High German dialects. \n\nOld English, Old Frisian and (to a lesser degree) Old Saxon share the application of the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law. Old Dutch was considerably less affected than the other three languages, but a dialect continuum formed or existed between both Old Dutch and Old Saxon, as well as Old Dutch and Old Frisian. Despite sharing some particular features, a number of disparities separate Old Saxon, Old English, and Old Dutch; one such difference is the Old Dutch use of \"-a\" as its plural a-stem noun ending, while Old Saxon and Old English employ \"-as\" or \"-os\". Much of the grammatical variation between Old Dutch and Old Saxon is similar to that between Old Dutch and Old High German.\n\nOld Dutch naturally evolved into Middle Dutch with some distinctions that approximate those found in most medieval West Germanic languages. The year 1150 is often cited as the time of the discontinuity, but it actually marks a time of profuse Dutch writing whose language is patently different from Old Dutch.\n\nThe most notable difference between Old and Middle Dutch is in a feature of speech known as vowel reduction. Round vowels in word-final syllables are rather frequent in Old Dutch, but in Middle Dutch, they are reduced to a schwa:\n\nThe following is a translation of Psalm 55:18, taken from the Wachtendonck Psalms; it shows the evolution of Dutch, from the original Old Dutch, written 900, to modern Dutch, but so accurately copies the Latin word order of the original that there is little information that can be garnered on Old Dutch syntax. In Modern Dutch, recasting is necessary to form a coherent sentence.\n\nOld Dutch texts are extremely rare and much more limited than for related languages like Old English and Old High German. Most of the earliest texts written in the Netherlands were written in Latin, rather than Old Dutch. Some of the Latin texts, however, contained Old Dutch words interspersed with the Latin text. Also, it is hard to determine whether a text actually was written in Old Dutch, as the Germanic languages spoken at that time were not standardised and were much more similar to one another.\n\nwad\nSeveral words that are known to have developed in the Netherlands before Old Dutch was spoken have been found, and they are sometimes called \"Oudnederlands\" (English: \"Old Netherlandic\") in a geographic sense. The oldest known example, \"wad\" (English: \"mudflat\"), had already been mentioned in AD 108 by Tacitus. The word exclusively referred to the region and ground type that is now known as the Wadden Sea. However, since the word existed long before Old Dutch did (and even before did its parent language, Frankish), it cannot be considered part of the vocabulary of Old Dutch but rather of Proto-Germanic.\n\nhaþuþuwas ann kusjam loguns\n\nThis sentence has been interpreted as \"[property] of Haþuþewaz. I bestow upon the choosers of the swords\". It was discovered on a sword sheath, excavated in 1996 in the Dutch village of Bergakker and is perhaps better described as Frankish than Old Dutch (Frankish was the direct parent language of Old Dutch). The text however, shows the beginning of Old Dutch morphology. The word \"ann\", found in the partially-translated inscription is coined as the oldest Dutch by linguists Nicoline van der Sijs and Tanneke Schoonheim from Genootschap Onze Taal. They attribute that word to the ancestor of the modern Dutch verb root \"gun\", through the addition of the prefix \"ge-\". The word has no clear English cognate. Its modern meaning is roughly \"to think someone deserves something, to derive satisfaction from someone else's success\", and it is commonly translated as \"grant\" or \"bestow\".\n\nMaltho thi afrio lito\nGlosses to the Salic law code (the \"Malbergse glossen\") contain several Old Dutch words and this full sentence, which is likely the earliest in the language. It translates as \"I declare, I free you, half-free\" and was written in the early 6th century. The phrase was used to free a serf. A \"lito\" (English: \"half-free\") was a form of serf in the feudal system, a half-free farmer, who was connected to the land of the lord for whom he worked but not owned by that lord. In contrast, a slave was fully owned by the lord. The Old Dutch word and the Modern Dutch counterpart \"laat\" are both etymologically and in meaning undoubtedly related to the verb root \"laat\" (English: 'let go', 'release'), which may indicate the fairly free status of such person in relation to that a slave. Note that the Old Dutch word \"lito\" is particularly recognisable in the verb's past tense \"lieten\".\n\nEnd ec forsacho allum dioboles uuercum and uuordum, Thunær ende Uuôden ende Saxnôte ende allum thêm unholdum thê hira genôtas sint.\nThe \"Utrecht Baptismal Vow\", or \"Old Saxon Baptismal Vow\", is a 9th-century baptismal vow that was found in a monastery library in the German city of Mainz but was written in the Dutch city of Utrecht. The sentence translates as \"And I renounce all the deeds and words of the devil, Thunear, Wōden and Saxnōt, and all those fiends that are their companions\". It mentions three Germanic pagan gods of the early Saxons which the reader is to forsake: Uuôden (\"Woden\"), Thunaer and Saxnōt. Scholar Rudolf Simek comments that the vow is of particular interest because it is the sole instance of the god Saxnōt mentioned in a religious context. One of many baptismal vows, it is now archived in the Vatican Codex pal. 577. Sometimes interpreteted as Old Saxon, a number of Dutch and German scholars have concluded the Baptismal Vow was actually written in the 8th century in Old Dutch. The difficulty in establishing whether the text was written in Old Saxon or Old Franconian is that those languages were very much alike.\n\nIrlôsin sol an frithe sêla mîna fan thên thia ginâcont mi, wanda under managon he was mit mi\nThe \"Wachtendonck Psalms\" are a collection of Latin psalms, with a translation in an eastern variety of Old Dutch (Old East Low Franconian) which contains a number of Old High German elements. The example sentence above translates as \"He will deliver my soul in peace from those who attack me, for, amongst many, he was with me.\" Probably based on a Central Franconian original, very little remains of the psalms. They were named after a manuscript that has not survived but was the source from which scholars believe the surviving fragments must have been copied. The manuscript was once owned by Canon Arnold Wachtendonck. The surviving fragments are handwritten copies made by the Renaissance scholar Justus Lipsius in the sixteenth century. Lipsius made a number of separate copies of what appeared to be the same material, but the versions do not always agree. In addition, scholars conclude that the numerous errors and inconsistencies in the fragments point not only to some carelessness or inattentiveness by the Renaissance scholars but also to errors in the now-lost manuscript out of which the material was copied. The language of the Psalms suggests that they were originally written in the 10th century.\n\nThes naghtes an minemo beddo vortheroda ich minen wino. Ich vortheroda hine ande ne vand sin niet.\nThis example sentence taken from the \"Leiden Willeram\" translates as \"All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him\". The manuscript, now in the library of the Leiden University in the Netherlands, contains an Old Dutch translation of an Old High German (East Frankish)commentary on Song of Solomon, written by the German abbot Williram of Ebersberg. The translation was done by a monk of the Abbey of Egmond, and so the manuscript's other name is \"Egmond Willeram\". The text represents an imperfect attempt to translate the original into the local Old Dutch vernacular. The text contains many Old Dutch words as well as mistranslated words since the scribe must have been unfamiliar with some Old High German words in the original. It could nevertheless be regarded as the first book written in Old Dutch. However, since the book never left the abbey, it cannot be regarded as the start of a Dutch literature and did not influence later works.\n\nHebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan hinase hic enda thu, uuat unbidan uue nu.\nArguably the most famous text containing Old Dutch, the fragment is translated as \"All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for?\" The text is dated from around 1100 and written by a West Flemish monk in a convent in Rochester, England. For a long time, the sentence was commonly but erroneously considered to be the earliest in Dutch. However, it could be considered the oldest Dutch non-religious poetry. The text is usually considered a West Flemish dialect, but certain Ingvaeonic forms might be expected in any of the coastal dialects of Old English, Old Frisian, Old Saxon or Old Dutch. However, the \"-n\" of the third-person plural \"hebban\", which is absent in both Old English and Frisian, identifies the language as Old Dutch (Old High German \"habent\" uses a different stem). \"Hagunnan\" and \"hi(c)\" have a prothetic \"h\", which points also to West Flemish in which the \"h\" was frequently dropped or, in the written language, added before vowels (compare \"abent\" in the Latin version). However, it has been postulated that the text could equally well be Old English, more specifically Old Kentish.\n\nnu saget mir einen kuning other greven, the an uren got wille gelouven, that se sagent, that ist gelogen, thes ist thaz arme volc bedrogen.\nTranslated as \"Mention one king or earl who wants to believe in their god, what they say is a lie, that's how the people are being deceived\", this fragment comes from an important source for Old Dutch: the Rhinelandic Rhyming Bible (Dutch: \"Rijnlandse Rijmbijbel\"; German: \"Rheinische Reimbibel\"). The verse translation of biblical histories is attested only in a series of fragments from different writers. It contains Low German (Low Saxon), Old Dutch (Low Franconian) and High German (Rhine-Franconian) elements. It was likely composed in the northwest of Germany in the early 12th century, possibly in Werden Abbey, near Essen.\n\nPhonologically, Old Dutch stands in between Old Saxon and Old High German, sharing some innovations with the latter, and others with the former.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below lists the consonantal phonemes of Old Dutch. For descriptions of the sounds and definitions of the terms, follow the links on the headings.\n\nNotes:\n\nFinal-obstruent devoicing of Proto-Germanic to occurred across the West Germanic languages, and thus also in Old Dutch. Old Dutch spelling also reveals final devoicing of other consonants, namely:\n\nFinal devoicing was countered by the syllable-initial voicing of voiceless fricatives, which made and allophones of each other.\n\nFinal devoicing appears much earlier in Old Dutch than it does Old Saxon and Old High German. In fact, by judging from the find at Bergakker, it would seem that the language already had inherited this characteristic from Old Frankish whereas Old Saxon and Old High German are known to have maintained word-final voiced obstruents much later (at least 900).\n\nNotes:\n\nIn unstressed syllables, only three vowels seem to have been reliably distinguished: open, front and back. In the Wachtendonck Psalms, the \"e\" and \"i\" merged in unstressed syllables, as did \"o\" and \"u\". That led to variants like \"dagi\" and \"dage\" (\"day\", dative singular) and \"tungon\" and \"tungun\" (\"tongue\", genitive, dative, accusative singular and nominative, dative, accusative plural). The forms with \"e\" and \"o\" are generally found later on, showing the gradual reduction of the articulatory distinction, eventually merging into a schwa (). A short phrase from the gospel book of Munsterbilzen Abbey, written around 1130, still shows several unstressed vowels distinguished:\n\nThat was a late monument, however, as the merging of all unstressed short vowels was already well underway by that time. Most likely, the difference was maintained only in spelling traditions, but it had been mostly lost in speech. With the introduction of new scribal traditions in the 12th and 13th century, the practices were abandoned, and unstressed vowels were consistently written as \"e\" from that time onward.\n\nNotes:\n\nOld Dutch was spelt using the Latin alphabet. However, since early missionaries in the Low Countries were mostly Old English and Old High German speakers, Old English and Old High German elements appear even if they were never present in the spoken language.\n\nThe length of a vowel was generally not represented in writing probably because the monks, who were the ones capable of writing and teaching how to write, tended to base the written language on Latin, which also does not make a distinction in writing: \"dag\" \"day\" (short vowel), \"thahton\" \"they thought\" (long vowel). Later on, the long vowels were sometimes marked with a macron to indicate a long vowel: \"ā\". In some texts long vowels were indicated by simply doubling the vowel in question, as in the placename \"Heembeke\" and personal name \"Oodhelmus\" (both from charters written in 941 and 797 respectively).\n\n\nOld Dutch preserved at least four of the six cases of Proto-Germanic: nominative, accusative, genitive and dative. A fifth case, the instrumental, may have also existed..\n\nThe \"-s\" ending in the masculine plural was preserved in the coastal dialects, as can be seen in the Hebban Olla Vogalla text where \"nestas\" is used instead of \"nesta\". Later on, the \"-s\" ending entered Hollandic dialects and became part of the modern standard language.\n\nDuring the Old Dutch period, the distinction between the feminine \"ō\"-stems and \"ōn\"-stems began to disappear, when endings of one were transferred to the other declension and vice versa, as part of a larger process in which the distinction between the strong and weak inflection was being lost not only in feminine nouns but also in adjectives. The process is shown in a more advanced stage in Middle Dutch.\n\nOld Dutch reflects an intermediate stage between Old Saxon and Old High German. Like Old High German, it preserved the three different verb endings in the plural (\"-on\", \"-et\" and \"-unt\") while the more northern languages have the same verb ending in all three persons. However, like Old Saxon, it had only two classes of weak verb, with only a few relic verbs of the third weak class, but the third class had still largely been preserved in Old High German.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2356756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2356756", "title": "Perfect season", "text": "Perfect season\n\nA perfect season is a sports season including any requisite playoff portion, in which a team remains and finishes undefeated and untied. The feat is extremely rare at the professional level of any team sport, and has occurred more commonly at the collegiate and scholastic levels in the United States. A perfect regular season (known by other names outside the United States of America) is a season \"excluding\" any playoffs, where a team remains undefeated and untied; it is less rare than a complete perfect season but still exceptional.\n\nA perfect season may be part of a multi-season winning streak.\n\nExhibition games are generally not counted toward standings, for or against. For example, the 1972 Miami Dolphins (below) lost three of their preseason (\"exhibition\" games in 1972 NFL vernacular) games but are considered to have had a perfect season.\n\nSince the National Football League began in 1920, only one team has played a complete perfect season (both regular season and playoffs): the 1972 Miami Dolphins, who won all fourteen of their regular season games and three postseason games, including Super Bowl VII, to finish the season 17–0–0.\n\nThe Dolphins briefly extended their winning streak before losing to the Oakland Raiders on September 23, 1973. It has often been reported that the surviving members of the 1972 Dolphins would, every season, either gather to drink champagne when the final undefeated team earned its first loss of the year, or send a case of champagne to the team who beat this final undefeated team. The head coach of the 1972 Dolphins, Don Shula, denied this in a 2007 interview with ESPN. On August 20, 2013, four decades after their accomplishment, President Barack Obama hosted the 1972 Dolphins noting that they \"never got their White House visit\".\n\nPrior to the development of a playoff system in the NFL in 1932, there were four teams who completed seasons undefeated, but with one or more tied games: the 1920 Akron Pros, the 1922 Canton Bulldogs, the 1923 Canton Bulldogs, and the 1929 Green Bay Packers. According to the 2012 NFL Record & Fact Book, under NFL practices at the time, from 1920 to 1971 tie games were not included in winning percentage (there was also no overtime to settle ties in the regular season until 1974) so, these four teams were recorded with perfect win percentages of 1.000.\n\nThe 1921 Buffalo All-Americans were controversially denied a similar type of near-undefeated season, when they believed that their final game, a 10-7 loss to the Chicago Staleys, was an exhibition game which would not count in the final standings; the NFL records that game as official, and Buffalo's record as 9–1–2.\n\nApart from the 1972 Dolphins, three NFL teams have completed undefeated and untied regular seasons: the 1934 Chicago Bears, the 1942 Chicago Bears, and the 2007 New England Patriots.\n\nIn 1934, the Bears played a 13–0–0 regular season and became the first NFL team to complete an undefeated regular season without tied games, but lost the 1934 NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants. Despite losing several players and head coach George Halas to military service in World War II, the 1942 Bears finished 11–0–0 but again lost the NFL Championship Game, this time against the Washington Redskins.\n\nThe 2007 Patriots became the first team after the NFL expanded its regular season to sixteen games in 1978 to finish the regular season undefeated. The Patriots then won their divisional and conference playoff games, but were upset by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, giving them a final record of 18–1.\n\nNFL predecessors such as the Ohio League, New York Pro Football League and Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit had many perfect seasons. In Ohio, the Massillon Tigers (1904, 1905), Akron Indians (1909), Shelby Blues (1911), and Dayton Triangles (1918) all had perfect seasons during this era. In New York, the Buffalo Niagaras went 5–0–0 (6–0–0 including a forfeit) in a league that consisted of teams entirely from the city of Buffalo in 1918. In 1920, the Union Club of Phoenixville, located in eastern Pennsylvania, played in a league mostly consisting of local teams and earned a perfect season, claiming for itself a mythical national championship. In western Pennsylvania, the 1900 and 1901 Homestead Library and Athletic Club teams, as well as the 1903 Franklin Athletic Club, all had perfect seasons.\n\nThe caliber of talent was neither as high nor as consistent between teams at the time, the seasons were generally shorter (7 to 11 games), and it was not uncommon for top teams to play all their games at home while lesser teams played all of their games on the road. In 1918, Dayton and Buffalo had the additional advantage of having its strongest competitors suspend operations due to the Spanish flu and the First World War, restrictions that also prevented the two teams from playing each other. Thus, it was much easier to earn a perfect season than it would become in the NFL.\n\nThe Los Angeles Bulldogs were a member of the second American Football League, who joined the league in 1937 after the Cleveland Rams defected to the NFL. Playing a combination of AFL teams and independent franchises (such as the Providence Steam Roller and the Salinas Packers), the team went 16–0, with 8 of those wins coming against AFL teams. The Bulldogs’ dominance is cited as one of the key factors in the AFL's demise, and the next season as an independent with a 10–2–2 record including a 2–1–2 record against NFL teams, several of the team's players were invited to play on the \"Pro All Stars\" team in the NFL's first Pro All-Star Game in Los Angeles. The Bulldogs are considered to be one of the few independent teams to have ever achieved parity with the NFL.\n\nThe Browns were a member of the All-America Football Conference, a professional football league that played from 1946 to 1949. In 1948, the Browns won all fourteen regular season games and the 1948 AAFC championship to post a 15–0–0 record. Cleveland's perfect 1948 season was part of a longer string of 29 straight wins, which stretched from 1947 to 1949 and included both the 1947 and 1948 title games. Overall, the Browns won all four AAFC championship games and were accepted into the NFL when the two leagues merged after the 1949 season.\n\nNeither the NFL nor the Pro Football Hall of Fame recognizes the Bulldogs’ perfect season; the Hall of Fame recognizes the Browns’ perfect season but the NFL does not.\n\nSince the NFL expanded to a fourteen-game regular season in 1961, eleven teams have had regular seasons with one loss and no ties (or better) while failing to achieve a perfect season:\nMost of these teams suffered their regular-season loss early in the year and, other than the 2007 Patriots (finished regular season 16–0), only the 1962 Packers (10–0), 1985 Bears (12–0), 2011 Packers (13–0), and 2015 Panthers (14–0) were on track for a perfect season when they lost. Coincidentally, the 1985 Bears’ lone loss came to the Miami Dolphins.\n\nThe best start from an NFL team who failed to complete a perfect regular season is shared by two teams: the 2009 Indianapolis Colts, who started 14–0 before losing their final two regular season games to the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills to finish 14–2, and the 2015 Carolina Panthers, who went 14–0 before losing to the Atlanta Falcons and going on to finish the regular season 15–1. The 2009 Colts, having clinched the top seed in the AFC, sacrificed their chances at a perfect regular season and instead rested their starters the final two games to protect them for the playoffs. The Colts would go on to Super Bowl XLIV but lost to the New Orleans Saints. The 2015 Panthers were not resting their starters at the time of their loss (at the time, the Arizona Cardinals were 13–2 and still had an opportunity to surpass the Panthers for the top seed in the NFC).\n\nFour other teams have started 13–0 before losing their fourteenth game: the 1998 Denver Broncos, 2005 Indianapolis Colts, 2009 New Orleans Saints and 2011 Green Bay Packers (Of those near-perfect seasons, the 2011 Packers are the only team that did not win a single playoff game). The 1998 Broncos, 2005 Colts and 2009 Saints lost at least two of their final three games but the Broncos and Saints recovered to win the Super Bowl. The 1953 Cleveland Browns and 1969 Los Angeles Rams started 11–0 in twelve- and fourteen-game seasons respectively; both lost their only playoff game.\n\nThe following is a list of teams in minor or alternate leagues that compiled perfect seasons of six games or more, including postseason games, with no ties:\n\n\nIn indoor football, the following teams have had perfect seasons:\n\n\nAt least twenty-three other semi-professional football teams have had perfect seasons, seven of them being at least 17 games long. The Chambersburg Cardinals won a record 72 straight games between 1977 and 1984.\n\nThere have been no perfect seasons (or even perfect regular seasons) in the American Association, World Football League, United States Football League, XFL, or, to date, the Arena Football League. The United Football League has had two perfect regular seasons, but neither qualify for the list: the 2009 Florida Tuskers finished 6–0, but that team lost the subsequent championship game; the 2012 Las Vegas Locomotives had a record of 4–0 when the league abruptly suspended operations halfway through the season.\n\nThe 1933 Providence Huskies (possibly a successor to the Providence Steam Roller) played arguably the most perfect season ever recorded by a professional or semi-professional team: a ten-game season in which they won every game and did not concede a single point during any game.\n\nIn the 2014 German Football League the Braunschweig Lions compiled a perfect season (12–0 postseason 3–0), losing only in the BIG6 European Football League which is a different competition. They crowned the season with another German Bowl triumph. Similarly in the 2016 German Football League the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns achieved a perfect regular season with a 14–0 record, similarly their lone defeat came in the BIG6 European Football League which is not considered for league standings. However, unlike Braunschweig before them, Schwäbisch Hall ultimately lost the German Bowl, in this case to Braunschweig. In the 2017 German Football League season, Schwäbisch Hall once more compiled a perfect season (14-0) but this time also won the German Bowl, again against Braunschweig. Interestingly, their opponent in the final had also entered the game with a 14-0 regular season record.\n\nA true perfect season (no losses and no ties through the regular season and playoffs) has never been achieved in professional Canadian football. Only one team, the 1948 Calgary Stampeders, has completed a perfect regular season.\n\nThe current Canadian Football League schedule would require a team to win 20 games (18 regular season, 1 playoff after bye week, and the Grey Cup championship) to post a perfect record.\n\nUnder head coach Les Lear, the 1948 Calgary Stampeders completed a perfect regular season with a record of 12–0; they had two wins and a tie during the playoffs to finish with a record of 14–0–1, the only undefeated complete season in Canadian pro history. In the Western Interprovincial Football Union championship (a home-and-home aggregate series decided on total points) against the Regina Roughriders, the first leg was tied 4–4, and the Stampeders won the second 21–10, to win the aggregate 25–14. The Stampeders then defeated the Ottawa Rough Riders 12–7 for the 36th Grey Cup.\n\nDespite the Stampeders' title, their achievement was only lightly regarded in the East. At the time, the Eastern and Western unions played separate regular seasons and only met in the Grey Cup. The Western union was openly regarded to be a weaker competition in the East, and Calgary's win (only the third for a Western team up to that time) was dismissed as a fluke.\n\nIn professional lacrosse, the 1993 Buffalo Bandits are the only team to have won a perfect season in the National Lacrosse League. The Bandits won all ten of their regular season games and won the championship in a two-round tournament; the season was the continuation of a multi-season winning streak that dated to the Bandits’ successful run for the previous year's championship.\n\nIn Major League Lacrosse, which began play in 2001, the 2013 Denver Outlaws were the first team to complete a perfect regular season, winning all fourteen of their games. After beating the Hamilton Nationals, the Outlaws had a sequence of twenty consecutive regular season wins despite losing the 2012 championship. However, the Outlaws lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Charlotte Hounds, who had only gone 7–7 in the regular season.\n\nIn North America's three other major professional sports leagues (Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League) it is almost impossible for a team to play a “perfect” season, primarily because there are substantially more games in the regular season (82 in the NBA and NHL, and 162 in Major League Baseball). The Women's National Basketball Association‘s season has been between 28 and 34 games long, and it too has never produced a perfect season.\n\nIt is possible for a baseball pitcher to achieve a perfect season, taking at least one win and any number of no-decisions throughout the year. This has happened 1813 times in baseball's history, though the majority (1171) were 1–0 seasons, mostly by relief pitchers. The best perfect season belongs to Tom Zachary of the 1929 New York Yankees, who posted a 12–0 record in 119.2 innings. No pitcher has ever achieved a perfect season while qualifying for the ERA title.\n\nIn the NBA, the 1985–86 Boston Celtics played a nearly perfect home season. During the regular season, they were 40–1 (.976) in front of their home crowd. The Celtics' only regular-season home loss occurred on December 6, 1985, to the Portland Trail Blazers, by the score of 121–103. The Celtics would also win all 10 of their home games in the postseason, to finish 50–1 at home. The 2015–16 San Antonio Spurs also played a nearly perfect home regular-season with a 40-1 (.976) record in front of their home crowd, with their only home loss occurring on April 10, 2016 vs. the Golden State Warriors by the score of 92-86. The Spurs were eliminated in the Western Conference Semi-Finals by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2016 NBA Playoffs. The Spurs played a total of 5 home games in the post season, finishing 43-3 at home, losing twice to the Thunder. The three-on-three basketball league BIG3, which featured an eight-game regular season and two-round playoff, had a perfect team in its inaugural season when Trilogy swept all ten games on their schedule.\n\nFor other sports leagues for individuals, such as the PGA Tour or NASCAR, a perfect season would represent winning every event in a season. Considering the number of tournaments or races in those leagues, and the fact that each individual faces over 40 opponents as opposed to one, a perfect season is almost impossible.\n\nGolf instead considers the Grand Slam, a sweep of the four men's major golf championships deemed to be the most difficult contests in professional golf, to be analogous to perfection. The only time the Grand Slam has been swept in any given year was 1930, when Bobby Jones won all four majors (at the time, The (British) Amateur Championship and U.S. Amateur were still considered majors); since 1934, when The Masters was added as a major, no player has won all four in one year. Tiger Woods is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001. The record for most consecutive wins in professional golf is 11, set Byron Nelson in 1945; Nelson would win 18 tournaments overall that year, a year when wartime manpower shortages were still limiting the number and quality of professional golfers for Nelson to compete against.\n\nIn Formula One, Michael Schumacher was the 2004 champion with 13 wins in 18 races. In IndyCar, A. J. Foyt won 10 out of 13 races. In NASCAR, Richard \"The King\" Petty holds most of the records for most wins in a season; he won 27 races out of 48 appearances in 1967, 10 of them consecutive. Since a format change in 1972, Petty also holds the modern-era record for most wins in a season, with 13, a record he shares with Jeff Gordon.\n\nProfessional motorcycle racer Ricky Carmichael had perfect seasons in 2002 and 2004. In 1997, road racer Tommy Kendall started the 13-race SCCA Trans-Am Series season 11–0, the longest documentable win streak in worldwide professional road racing. In the 12th race, he was battling for the lead on the final lap, but spun out and finished second. The feat would be extremely difficult in NASCAR, because of the length of the season (currently 36 races).\n\nIn 1966 Waynesburg College went 11–0 after a 9–0 regular season record.\nIn December 1966 Waynesburg defeated New Mexico Highlands in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the playoff game, \nand, defeated Whitewater Wisconsin in the NAIA Champion Bowl at Tulsa Oklahoma.\nThis was, and still is a college football rarity. \nVery few college football teams have won a College National Football Championship (including playoff games)\nwith an undefeated record.\n\nDue to relatively short seasons through most of college football history, the list of undefeated Division I football teams includes dozens of teams. The highest level of college football, the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (introduced as Division I-A in 1978), did not use a playoff to determine a champion prior to the introduction of the four-team College Football Playoff (CFP) in 2014. The system replaced by the CFP relied on a combination of polls and computer rankings to choose two teams to play one title game in a system known as the Bowl Championship Series. Prior to 1992, no attempt was made to match up the top two teams in a championship game, further increasing the chances of multiple teams achieving a perfect season. The record for most wins in an undefeated FBS season is 14–0, accomplished in 2002 by Ohio State, twice in 2009 by Boise State and Alabama, in 2010 by Auburn, and in 2013 by Florida State.\n\nThe University of Washington's FBS record 64-game unbeaten streak included five straight perfect seasons from 1909–13. The University of Oklahoma's FBS record 47 game winning streak included three straight perfect seasons from 1954–56.\n\nBefore the establishment of the National Invitation Tournament in 1938 and the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 1939, perfect seasons were more common; each season consisted of fewer games and top teams from different parts of the country might never meet.\n\nEight teams have completed perfect seasons, including postseason tournament victories, since the tournament era began in 1938:\n\nIn addition, four other teams in the tournament era had unbeaten records, but did not play in any postseason tournament:\n\nThe UCLA Bruins are the only team to have back-to-back perfect seasons (1971–1972, 1972–1973), and all four of the college's perfect seasons were under Hall of Fame head coach John Wooden.\n\nThe following teams completed a perfect regular season, but lost in the NCAA Tournament or other postseason action:\n\nIn the women's game, the following national championship teams have had perfect records since the AIAW began sponsoring a championship tournament in 1972 (which was followed by the NCAA tournament in 1982):\n\nThe following teams completed perfect regular seasons, but lost in the NCAA Tournament or other postseason action:\nNotably, the 2015–16 season saw \"all three\" NCAA women's champions finish with unbeaten seasons. In Division II, Lubbock Christian went 34–0. In Division III, Thomas More went 33–0 for the second straight season.\n\nAmong schools in the top level of men's ice hockey, the 1969–70 Cornell Big Red went 29–0–0 in the University Division (the predecessor to today's Division I) en route to a national championship.\n\nSince Cornell's 29–0–0 season in 1969–70, the closest Division I Men's Ice Hockey Team to having a perfect season was the 1992–93 Maine Black Bears, who finished that year at 42–1–2, including a national title game victory against Lake Superior State. Their only loss came on February 19, 1993, against Boston University, where they lost 7-6 in overtime, and their only ties were on October 24 against Providence, 3-3, and on January 15 against Clarkson, 4-4.\n\nThe last men's team to finish unbeaten and untied and be national champions was the 1983–84 Bemidji State Beavers (31–0–0), who were then competing in Division II, a level of competition that no longer conducts a championship.\n\nThe 1955–56 Clarkson Golden Knights were undefeated and untied (23–0–0), but skipped the NCAA tournament because as the team had seniors with four years of college play which was against NCAA tournament rules at the time (not regular season rules).\n\nThe 1967–68 Iona Gaels went 16–0–0 in their inaugural season as an independent in Division III, but did not participate in a national championship as none existed for Division III at that time.\n\nThe most recent unbeaten and untied season in NCAA ice hockey at the highest level was in 2012–13 when the Minnesota Golden Gophers became the first NCAA women's team ever to accomplish the feat (41–0–0).\n\nThe 2007–08 University of Illinois Fighting Illini, a club team, are the only American Collegiate Hockey Association team to record a perfect season with a record of 38–0–0.\n\nIn 1975 the number-one-ranked University of Ottawa Gee Gees had the first Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now U Sports) undefeated season. After completing their perfect regular season at 8–0, the Gees Gees won their first play-off defeating the number-two-ranked Toronto Varsity Blues 14–7. The Gees Gees then demolished the Windsor Lancers 45–6 to win the Yates Cup and the right to play for the national championship and the Vanier Cup. The undefeated season was completed on November 21, 1975, when the Gee Gees defeated the University of Calgary Dinos 14–9 at CNE Stadium in Toronto. That night the Gee Gees became the first undefeated team in CIS and Vanier Cup history. The 1975 Gees Gees roster had a big impact on the CFL. Gee Gee Players from the 1975 team played in the CFL for a cumulative total of 96 years and throughout their professional careers in the CFL accomplished: one Canadian Football Hall of Fame Inductee, one Grey Cup Canadian MVP, two Frank M. Gibson Trophies for Outstanding Rookie Eastern Division, two CFL Leo Dandurand Trophy Outstanding Lineman Eastern Division, twenty CFL and Divisional All-Star Selections, twenty-three Grey Cup Appearances and a total of twelve Grey Cup rings.\n\nIn 2003 and 2005, the Saskatchewan Huskies completed perfect regular seasons. However, in both years they lost in the playoffs: in the Vanier Cup to the Laurier Golden Hawks in 2005, and in the Canada West semi-final to Alberta Golden Bears in 2003.\n\nA perfect season was attained in 2007 by the Manitoba Bisons, the football squad representing the University of Manitoba, located in Winnipeg. The Bisons were undefeated in Canada West Universities Athletic Association play during the 8-game schedule. In the playoffs, Manitoba comfortably handled the Calgary Dinos 27–5 in the opening round. The Bisons followed up with a 48–5 defeat of the Regina Rams in the Hardy Trophy and a strong 52–20 showing against the perennial contenders from the University of Western Ontario, the Western Ontario Mustangs, in the Mitchell Bowl. On Friday, November 23, 2007, two days before the 95th Grey Cup game in Toronto, the Bisons defeated the Saint Mary's University squad, known as the Saint Mary's Huskies, 28–14 to claim their first Vanier Cup championship since 1970, and third overall title. That victory capped their perfect 12 win season.\n\nIn 2010, the Laval Rouge et Or located in Quebec City, had a perfect season of 13–0. They were undefeated with an 8–0 record in the QUFL. During the playoffs, they beat the Bishop's Gaiters 56–1 in the opening round. The Rouge et Or won the QUFL championship and the Dunsmore Cup by a close win of 22–17 against the Sherbrooke Vert et Or. They followed with a win of 13–11 against the Western Ontario Mustangs in the Uteck Bowl. Finally, on Saturday, November 27, 2010, in their home stadium in Quebec City, they won the Vanier Cup 29–2 against the Calgary Dinos, capping a 13–0 season.\n\nThe 1972–73 University of Toronto Varsity Blues (22–0–0) are the only men's hockey team in U Sports to win a national championship with no losses and no ties in the regular season and post season. The Varsity Blues won all 17 regular season games to place first in the Ontario University Athletics Association's East Division. In sudden death OUAA playoff action, the U of T defeated the University of Waterloo 13–2 and the University of Western Ontario 8–1. The University of Toronto downed the University of Alberta 5–2 and 5–3 in the University Cup semi final at Edmonton and shaded St. Mary's University 3–2 in the University Cup final at Toronto.\n\nThe 1975–76 St. Clair College Saints (26–0–0) of Windsor, Ontario were the first of two Canadian Colleges Athletic Association men's hockey teams to go unbeaten and untied in the regular season and post season en route to a national title. After winning all 20 regular season games to finish atop the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association's Western Division, St. Clair outscored Fanshawe 5–2 and 6–3 to win the division playoff series and advance to the conference championships where they topped Algonquin 8–2 and Humber 11–2. At the CCAA Hockey National Championships in Camrose, Alberta, St. Clair downed Cape Breton 10–4 in the semi final and Selkirk 11–2 in the final.\n\nThe 1984–85 Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) Ooks (33–0–0) of Edmonton won all 25 of their regular season games in the Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference prior to sweeping the Camrose Lutheran College Vikings in a best-of-three conference semifinal series and the Red Deer College Kings in a best-of-five conference final series. At the CCAA Hockey National Championships in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, NAIT outscored the Cariboo College Chiefs 8–2, the Seneca College Braves 5–2 and the Victoriaville College Vulkins 9–2 to hoist the CCAA Championship Bowl.\n\nThe VFL began in 1897. Based entirely in the state of Victoria, before it expanded through the 1980s, and 1990s to become the top level national league (AFL) in the sport of Australian rules football. The length of a complete season (including finals matches) has typically been between 18 and 26 games. Throughout the history of the league, no team has ever completed a perfect season. One team, in 1929, completed a perfect home-and-away season, finishing with a record of 18–0; the club won the premiership, but did not complete a perfect season after losing the second semi-final against .\n\nThe SANFL has existed since 1877 within South Australia, and until the latter part of the twentieth century was of equivalent standard to the VFL. The only perfect season to be completed was by the 1914 Port Adelaide team, known as the \"Invincibles\". Port won all four of its pre season matches. It finished the minor round with a 12–0 record, before winning both finals to finish with a 14–0 record and a perfect season. They also won the Championship of Australia against VFL premiers Carlton, to extend that record to 15–0. In addition to this the club played a combined team from all the other SAFL clubs and won to extend the record to 16–0. The closest any team got to Port Adelaide was North Adelaide, losing by 21 points in Round 10. This is the only instance in The Big Three Australian football leagues (VFL/SANFL/WAFL) where a club has gone undefeated in the pre-season, season main and post season.\n\nIn 1912, Port Adelaide had a perfect minor round and then beat West Torrens in its semi-final but lost both the final and Grand Final to West Adelaide.\n\nThe WAFL has existed since 1885 within Western Australia, and until the latter part of the 20th century was of equivalent standard to either the VFL or SANFL. The 1946 East Fremantle team was the first club in senior WAFL football to have managed a perfect season or even a perfect home-and-away season, winning all twenty-one of its games; it is noted that the playing lists of many of its opponents had been seriously depleted by World War II. The only loss for the season came against Collingwood in a post season match. The 2018 Subiaco team won all of its 18 games in the minor round before winning both their second-semi-final against South Fremantle and the Grand Final against West Perth.\n\nThe Victorian Football League, known until 1996 as the Victorian Football Association, began in 1877 and was Victoria's premier football league until 1897, and has been the second-tier league in the state since. Perfect seasons have been completed on four occasions in VFA/VFL history:\n\nThere were also cases of teams going undefeated through the season in the nineteenth century, but none completed perfect seasons because some of their matches were drawn. Of those, could be interpreted as having been perfect in 1879; it had a record of 15–0–1, and the draw came by agreement when a match was abandoned due to inclement weather.\n\nFour other teams have completed perfect home-and-away seasons, but subsequently lost finals matches:\n\nThe National Rugby League has existed since 1908, being originally known as the New South Wales Rugby League and before the Super League war of 1995 as the Australian Rugby League. In its history, only one team has completed a perfect season: the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1925, who won all twelve games contested.\n\nFive other teams have gone undefeated but featured at least one drawn match: Balmain (1915), North Sydney (1921), Eastern Suburbs (1936 and 1937) and St George (1959).\nThe Brisbane Rugby League premiership began in 1909 and continued in varying forms until 1996, after which it was superseded by the Queensland Cup. Between the 1930s and the 1960s it was of comparable standard to the New South Wales Rugby Football League, but subsequently a huge drain of players to Sydney eroded the standard of play. Before World War II seasons were typically no more than twelve games long; however as the competition grew it was expanded to 21 games by 1960. The only BRL teams to manage a perfect season were:\n\nThe following team managed an undefeated season but drew one game:\n\nThe following teams managed an undefeated home-and-away season, but subsequently lost finals matches:\n\nWhilst no rugby league team in Britain has completed the perfect season in the top flight, this has been achieved on two occasions in lower divisions, once in the 2nd division and once in the 3rd. Hull F.C. achieved this feat in the 1978–79 Season, where they won 26 from 26 games, gaining promotion to the top division for the second time in three seasons. This was also achieved by the Dewsbury Rams in 2009 during their Championship 1 (third division) season where they won all 18 games from a possible 18, winning promotion immediately after being relegated the previous season where they won just two games. Since their 2009 promotion, the Rams have so far stayed in the sports' second division, including two play off finishes.\n\nIn 2017, the Toronto Wolfpack completed the regular reason with a perfect 15–0 record, however after the Super 8s finished with a 22-1-1 record.\n\nThe New Zealand All Blacks were the first professional rugby team to produce a perfect rugby test season in 2013. They successfully defeated four times, three times, and twice and also beat , and in their incredible winning run. They produced a record of 14–0–0, defeating the top 5 ranked teams below them in the IRB world rankings. have matched this feat after producing a perfect test season in 2016 after recovering from getting knocked out of their own World Cup in 2015.\n\nThe Southern Hemisphere's principal team competition, Super Rugby, established as Super 12 in 1996 and later known as Super 14 before adopting its current name in 2011, has seen only one perfect season. The Crusaders, based in Christchurch and representing a large portion of the South Island of New Zealand, finished the 2002 Super 12 season with an 11–0–0 record and went on to win both of their finals matches to claim the season crown unbeaten.\n\nOne other team has won a championship unbeaten: in 1997, the Auckland Blues (known simply as \"Blues\" since 2000), which at the time represented the central and southern parts of the Auckland area plus some adjacent regions to the south, finished the regular season with one draw from 11 matches. They also won both of their finals matches to claim the title.\n\nMany association football teams have also had perfect seasons, however doing so in a season of 20 or more matches is very rare. Clubs to have achieved this include: Dresdner SC of Germany in 1942–43 (23 wins out of 23), Ferencvárosi of Hungary in 1931–32 (22), Sunrise Flacq United of Mauritius in 1995–96 (22), and Nacional of Uruguay in 1941 (20). Al-Ahly (of Egypt) hold the record of going a whole season being unbeaten, in all possible competitions they were involved in (46 matches in total played in: Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, Egyptian Super Cup and CAF Champions League between 2005 and 2006). The longest winning streak of any team over multiple seasons was Sparta Prague's run of at least 51 wins in a row, between 1920 and 1923.\n\nTeams finishing a season unbeaten (i.e. having won or drawn every match) are more common. Arsenal in the 2003–04 English Premier League season, finished with no losses from 38 games over 100 years after Preston North End unbeaten streak in 22 league games and all of its FA Cup games in 1888–89. At the same time, AFC Wimbledon finished with a record of 42 wins, 4 draws and 0 defeats out of 46 games in their Combined Counties League Premier Division season. In Belgium, From 1933 to 1935 Royale Union Saint-Gilloise played 60 consecutive matches undefeated, setting a still unbeaten record in Belgium. In Italy, Perugia (1978–79), A.C. Milan (1991–92), and Juventus F.C. (2011–12) have been undefeated. In Turkish soccer, Galatasaray in the 1985–86 season completed the season unbeaten but finished as runners-up, although having the same points as Beşiktaş J.K., who won, but had an inferior goal difference to their rival. Beşiktaş J.K. in 1991–92 completed the season unbeaten and became Turkish League's only ever champions without defeat. In Portugal, Benfica (1972–73) was the first club to do so and won 28 matches – 23 consecutively – out of 30, and drew two. They also went undefeated in 1977–78 but finished second to Porto, who lost once that season. Porto finished the 2010–11 and 2012–13 seasons unbeaten, with a respective win–draw record of 27–3 and 24–6. In Saudi Arabia, Al-Hilal FC finished a 26-game season in the 2010–11 with 19 wins and 7 draws, whilst in Iraq, Al-Shorta FC went the entire 1980–81 Iraqi League season undefeated. Greek club Panathinaikos F.C. finished the 1963–64 season, Hungarian club Debreceni VSC finished the 2011–12 season, Norwegian club Rosenborg BK finished the 2010 season undefeated. The only unbeaten champion in Brazil was SC Internacional, who won the 1979 season with 16 victories and 7 ties. In Israel, Maccabi Haifa finished the 1993–1994 season (a 39-game season) in the Israeli Premier League with 28 wins and 11 draws.\n\nEgyptian Premier League giants Al Ahly are the only African club to have ever completed an entire domestic season unbeaten, let alone twice, having won their 30th league title in the 2004–05 season with a record of 24 wins and 2 draws and their 31st league title the following season with a slightly worse record of 23 wins and 3 draws.\n\nOn October 4, 2014 eventual Icelandic champions Stjarnan who were unbeaten faced an FH side in an away game which was the last game of the season, coincidentally before the match, FH were also unbeaten. In a closely fought match Stjarnan emerged victorious courtesy of a 94th-minute penalty from Ólafur Karl Finsen to knock FH out of first place and secure Stjarnan's first Icelandic championship.\n\nCeltic went domestically unbeaten across the 2016–17 season over all 38 league games in Scotland, finishing 30 points clear of second-place Aberdeen with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the 2016–17 Scottish League Cup and the 2016–17 Scottish Cup, giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.\n\nThe likelihood of a national team in the FIFA World Cup to win all of its matches in regulation time to become the champion is much higher than most clubs in their domestic league, as the finals tournament in its current format only lasts seven games — although this feat has only happened twice, Brazil on both instances in 1970 and 2002. This is not counting the qualifying round of the tournament, which lasts over a year and has had a varied format since 1934. Only the Brazilian team of 1970 has won every game in the qualification and final rounds of a single tournament, a total of 13 games. In 2010, the Netherlands came very close achieving the same feat as Brazil did in 1970. The Netherlands won 8 out of 8 qualifying games and went on to win the next 6 World Cup matches in regulation time only to lose in extra time to Spain in the final, ending with a 14–0–1 record.\n\nThrough 2011, the likelihood of a national team winning all of its matches in the FIFA Women's World Cup was slightly greater than in the men's version. The Women's World Cup began in 1991 with 12 teams and expanded to 16 effective in 1999. Under both structures, the winning team only had to win six games (three in group play and three in the knockout stage) to win the title unbeaten. The tournament expanded to 24 teams in 2015, at which time the number of games that the champion must play increased to seven (the same total as in the men's World Cup).\n\nThe 2011 event, won by Japan, was the first in which the champion lost in group play; the other finalist, the USA, had also lost in group play. Each previous team to have won the title — the US in 1991 and 1999, Norway in 1995, and Germany in 2003 and 2007 — won all of its group stage matches. In fact, only one of these teams, the US in 1999, had a knockout match go to extra time—specifically the final against China, which ultimately went to a penalty shootout. Germany won all of its matches in the 2007 final tournament without giving up a goal, becoming the first team in either the men's or women's World Cup to accomplish this feat. The USA's third championship team in 2015 had one draw in the group stage.\n\nThree Women's World Cup champions also went through their qualifying stage without a loss or draw:\n\nOf the other two teams to win the Women's World Cup without a loss or draw in the finals:\n\nIn 2011/2012, German handball champion THW Kiel achieved a perfect season of as many as 34 matches. Additionally, the team also won the national DHB Cup and the international EHF Champions League.\n\nIn the Liga ASOBAL the FC Barcelona Handbol had 4 consecutive perfect seasons from the 2013-14 season to the 2016-17 season.\n\nIn the Premijer liga the RK Zagreb is unbeaten for 11 years, they won 190 consecutive games, last time they lost against Osijek Motormodul (38:39) on 14.4.2007. In that 190 games they just have one tie with RK Poreč (31:31), after that game they won 178 games in a row and that row is still active.\n\nIn the 2012–13 Season, Vakıfbank İstanbul won all 52 games and reached five championship trophies in\n\nVakıfbank İstanbul won 6 games in Turkish Women's Volleyball Cup, 12 games in CEV Women's Champions League, 29 games (22 league, 7 play-off games) in Turkish Women's Volleyball League, 1 game in Turkish Women's Volleyball Super Cup and 4 games in FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship, and never lost in the 2012–13 Season. In addition, they won all 51 games they played in year 2013.\n\nHaving started Turkish Women's Volleyball League's 2013–14 Season with 13 wins and 2013–14 CEV Women's Champions League with 8 wins, they extended their winning streak to 73 games as of January 23, 2014.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank Trophy was the main national netball competition in Australia from 1997 to 2007. There were eight teams in a double round robin format and finals.\n\nThe Sydney Swifts were the only team to achieve a perfect season, winning all fourteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 16–0.\n\nThe ANZ Championship, the principal netball competition for Australia and New Zealand was established in 2008 to replace the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. Comprising ten teams (five from Australia and five from New Zealand) there has so far been one perfect season, by the Mission Queensland Firebirds, based in Brisbane, Queensland in 2011. The Firebirds won thirteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 15–0. In 2010, the New South Wales Swifts managed to win all thirteen regular season games, but lost both of their finals matches and ended with a 13–2 for that year.\n\nEnglish first-class county cricket has existed as the top tier of domestic cricket in England since the middle nineteenth century, and until the 1950s it was up to the highest standard of the game. Seasons have varied in length: before the 1880s, they were generally less than ten matches in length and some \"first-class\" counties played only against one or two different opponents, so that a team winning all its games was not implausible. Between 1887 and 1929, seasons were gradually increased in length to a standard twenty-eight matches for all counties. However, because of the development and popularity of one-day cricket, seasons have been reduced to twenty-four games in 1969 and twenty in 1972, though this was increased by two in 1977 and 1983. With an increase to four days for all games, sixteen or seventeen games have been played since 1993.\n\nAlso, because of improvements to pitches via the heavy roller and covering to protect from rain, the proportion of games \"drawn\" (not finished) has steadily risen since the 1870s.\n\nSince tables of results have been kept in 1864, the only team to have competed a true perfect season – winning outright every game – was Yorkshire in 1867 when led by George Freeman's and Tom Emmett's deadly fast bowling on uncovered and unrolled pitches, they won all seven county games.\n\nEssex CCC achieved the feat in the Summer of 2017, with the bowling combination of Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter doing most of the damage. Ryan Ten Doeschate captained the side,\n\nSince 1868 numerous county teams in longer schedules have finished a season unbeaten, but none have managed to win every single game outright:\nIn 2011 and 2012, the Washington Kastles of World Team Tennis completed back-to-back perfect seasons, the first major sports franchise in the United States to do so. The Kastles swept each of the 2011 and 2012 regular seasons with a perfect 14–0 record, then in each season went on to win their two postseason games and league's championship, amassing a 32-game winning streak in the process. This streak stands one short of the all-time professional sports record in the United States by the 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIn the 2017 season the Swiss mountain biker Nino Schurter won 6 out of 6 races and additionally at the World Championships he won the gold medal at the singel and at the mixed race and the Cape Epic.\n\nIn the 2016 season the British mountain biker Rachel Atherton won 7 out of 7 races and additionally at the World Championships she won the gold medal. \n\n"}

One sense of the term is from psychological research in the middle of the twentieth century, meaning a composite psychological measurement which attempts to integrate various elements of a person's thought processes, often a diagram, usually in the form of a circle. According to one source, in this sense, a psychogram denoted \"not the sum of elements but their interrelationship\" as a way to reduce \"complex happenings to a simple design which enables the individual to make his decision.\" The term was used by a few psychologists such as Daniel S. Anthony in the 1960s, It was used as a visual representation or \"map\" of an individual's personality. The term never caught on within the mainstream psychological academic establishment, possibly because there was no consistent sense of what psychograms were or how they should be used. There is a different, yet slightly related sense of the term, which refers to a specific system of handwriting analysis in the field of graphology. A third sense of the term has less emphasis on measuring personality and more on measuring psychological perception, with the term being used in conjunction with the Rorschach inkblot projection technique, so that the scores on various measures following a Rorschach test are combined into a summary of all the scored responses, called a psychogram. There are other senses which appear sporadically and which are not used consistently. For example, the term has been used in a few book titles; the psychology department of Illinois State University used the term as the title of a newsletter; it was used to describe a type of poetry. The term appeared briefly in 1896 in connection with early vision experiments regarding perception.\n"}

{"id": "25247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25247", "title": "Quill", "text": "Quill\n\nA quill pen is a writing implement made from a moulted flight feather (preferably a primary wing-feather) of a large bird. Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen, the metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool, because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and wear down the quill very quickly. However, it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen. \n\nIn a carefully prepared quill the slit does not widen through wetting and drying with ink. It will retain its shape adequately and only requires infrequent sharpening and can be used time and time again until there is little left of it. The hollow shaft of the feather (the \"calamus\") acts as an ink reservoir and ink flows to the tip by capillary action. \n\nThe strongest quills come from the primary flight feathers discarded by birds during their annual moult. Generally feathers from the left wing (it is supposed) is favored by the right-handed majority of British writers because the feather curves away from the sight line, over the back of the hand. The quill barrel is cut to six or seven inches in length, so no such consideration of curvature or 'sight-line' is necessary. Additionally, writing with the left-hand in the long era of the quill was discouraged, and quills were never sold as left and right-handed, only by their size and species. \n\nGoose feathers are most commonly used; scarcer, more expensive swan feathers are used for larger lettering. Depending on availability and strength of the feather, as well as quality and characteristic of the line wanted by the writer, other feathers used for quill-pen making include those from the crow, eagle, owl, hawk, and turkey. On a true quill, the barbs are stripped off completely on the trailing edge. (The pinion for example only has significant barbs on one side of the barrel.) Later, a fashion developed for stripping partially and leaving a decorative top of a few barbs. The fancy, fully plumed quill is mostly a Hollywood invention and has little basis in reality. Most, if not all, manuscript illustrations of scribes show a quill devoid of decorative barbs, or at least mostly stripped.\n\nQuill pens were used to write the vast majority of medieval manuscripts, including the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence. \nQuill pens are still used today mainly by professional scribes and calligraphers.\n\nQuills are also used as the plectrum material in string instruments, particularly the harpsichord.\n\nQuills were the primary writing instrument in the western world from the 6th to the 19th century. The best quills were usually made from goose, swan, and later turkey feathers. Quills went into decline after the invention of the metal pen, mass production beginning in Great Britain as early as 1822 by John Mitchell of Birmingham.\n\nQuill pens were the instrument of choice during the medieval era due to their compatibility with parchment and vellum. Before this the reed pen had been used, but a finer letter was achieved on animal skin using a cured quill. Other than written text, they were often used to create figures, decorations, and images on manuscripts, although many illuminators and painters preferred fine brushes for their work. The variety of different strokes in formal hands was accomplished by good penmanship as the tip was square cut and rigid, exactly as it is today with modern steel pens.\n\nIt was much later, in the 1600s, with the increased popularity of writing, especially in the copperplate script promoted by the many printed manuals available from the 'Writing Masters', that quills became more pointed and flexible.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court Historical Society, 20 goose-quill pens, neatly crossed, are placed at the four counsel tables each day the U.S. Supreme Court is in session; \"most lawyers appear before the Court only once, and gladly take the quills home as souvenirs.\" This has been done since the earliest sessions of the Court.\n\nQuills are denominated from the order in which they are fixed in the wing; the first is favoured by the expert calligrapher, the second and third quills being very satisfactory also, plus the pinion feather. Flags the 5th and 6th feathers are also used. No other feather on the wing would be considered suitable by a professional scribe.\n\nInformation can be obtained on the techniques of curing and cutting quills\n\nIn order to harden a quill that is soft, thrust the barrel into hot ashes, stirring it till it is soft; then taking it out, press it almost flat upon your knees with the back of a penknife, and afterwards reduce it to a roundness with your fingers. If you have a number to harden, set water and alum over the fire; and while it is boiling put in a handful of quills, the barrels only, for a minute, and then lay them by.\n\nAn accurate account of the Victorian process by William Bishop, from researches with one of the last London quill dressers, is recorded in the \"Calligrapher's Handbook\" cited on this page.\n\nA quill knife was the original primary tool used for cutting and sharpening quills, known as \"dressing\".\n\nFollowing the decline of the quill in the 1820s, after the introduction of the maintenance-free, mass-produced steel dip nib by John Mitchell, knives were still manufactured but became known as desk knives, stationery knives or latterly as the name stuck \"pen\" knives. \n\nA \"pen\" knife by contrast has two flat sides. This distinction is not recognised by modern traders, dealers or collectors, who define a quill knife as any small knife with a fixed or hinged blade, including such items as ornamental fruit knives.\n\nPlectra for psalteries and lutes can be cut similarly to writing pens. The rachis, the portion of the stem between the barbs, not the calamus, of the primary flight feathers of birds of the crow family was preferred for harpsichords. In modern instruments, plastic is more common, but they are often still called \"quills\". The lesiba uses a quill attached to a string to produce sound.\n\n\n"}

This silent period has been claimed to be typically found in children and has been called the second stage of second language acquisition, following the use of L1 and preceding productive use of L2, and can last between a few weeks to a year.\n\nWhile the silent period has received a lot of endorsement from researchers and educators, some argue against the validity of such a period. There are debates surrounding its significance in language acquisition, of how language teachers should address such a period in school curriculum, and what exactly language learners are processing (or not) during such a period.\n\nThere is controversy as to whether there is such a defined silent period of active learning. Studies in support of a silent period have used variable methods and definitions of silence. Some define it as the absence of any L2, while others define it as the absence of productive syntax in L2. Moreover, these studies were conducted across variable settings, and report a big range in the length of silent periods. Ultimately, even if these studies did properly established a non-verbal phase, there is still a lack of evidence that it involves active learning, as opposed to general incomprehension or shyness.\nThe general concept of the silent period also seems at odds with the communicative nature of language and language acquisition.\n\nGeneral support for a silent period of active learning leads to certain implications in language teaching. Educators are less likely to expect engagement from L2 learners early on in acquisition, and might not try to elicit speech from L2 learners. However, if the silent period is not empirically founded, or if it reflects general incomprehension or shyness rather than active learning, then these pedagogical methods have to be reevaluated.\n\nThe silent period has been used in language teaching methods such as Total Physical Response, the natural approach, and Automatic Language Growth.\n"}
{"id": "9131098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9131098", "title": "Six-bit character code", "text": "Six-bit character code\n\nA six-bit character code is a character encoding designed for use on computers with word lengths a multiple of 6. Six bits can only encode 64 distinct characters, so these codes generally include only the upper-case letters, the numerals, some punctuation characters, and sometimes control characters. Such codes with additional parity bit were a natural way of storing data on 7-track magnetic tape.\n\nAn early six-bit binary code was used for Braille, the reading system for the blind that was developed in the 1820s.\n\nThe earliest computers dealt with numeric data only, and made no provision for character data. Six-bit BCD was used by IBM on early computers such as the IBM 704 in 1954. This encoding was replaced by the 8-bit EBCDIC code when System/360 standardized on 8-bit bytes. There are some variants of this type of code (see below).\n\nSix-bit character codes generally succeeded the five-bit Baudot code and preceded seven-bit ASCII. One popular variant was DEC SIXBIT. This is simply the ASCII character codes from 32 to 95 coded as 0 to 63 by subtracting 32 (i.e., columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the ASCII table (16 characters to a column), shifted to columns 0 through 3, by subtracting 2 from the high bits); it includes the space, punctuation characters, numbers, and capital letters, but no control characters. Since it included no control characters, not even end-of-line, it was not used for general text processing. However, six-character names such as filenames and assembler symbols could be stored in a single 36-bit word of PDP-10, and three characters fit in each word of the PDP-1 and two characters fit in each word of the PDP-8.\n\nSix-bit codes could encode more than 64 characters by the use of Shift Out and Shift In characters, essentially incorporating two distinct 62-character sets and switching between them. For example, the popular IBM 2741 communications terminal supported a variety of character sets of up to 88 printing characters plus control characters.\n\nA UTF-6 encoding was proposed for Unicode but was superseded by Punycode.\n\nSix-bit BCD code was the adaptation of the punched card code to binary code. IBM applied the terms \"binary-coded decimal\" and \"BCD\" to the variations of BCD \"alphamerics\" used in most early IBM computers, including the IBM 1620, IBM 1400 series, and non-Decimal Architecture members of the IBM 700/7000 series.\n\nA six-bit code was also used in COBOL databases, where end-of-record information was stored separately.\n\nA six-bit code, with added odd parity bit, is used on Track 1 of magnetic stripe cards, as specified in ISO/IEC 7811-2.\n\nA DEC SIXBIT code including a few control characters — along with SO/SI, allowing code extension — was specified as ECMA-1 in 1963 (see below). Another, less common, variant is obtained by just stripping the high bit of an ASCII code in 32 - 95 range (codes 32 - 63 remain at their positions, higher values have 64 subtracted from them). Such variant was sometimes used on DEC's PDP-8 (1965).\n\nFIELDATA was a seven-bit code (with optional parity) of which only 64 code positions (occupying six bits) were formally defined. A variant was used by UNIVAC's 1100-series computers. Treating the code as a six-bit code these systems used a 36-bit word (capable of storing 6 such reduced FIELDATA characters).\n\nBraille characters are represented using six dot positions, arranged in a rectangle. Each position may contain a raised dot or not, so Braille can be considered to be a six-bit binary code.\n\nTransmission of binary data over systems which are designed for text only can sometimes introduce problems. For example, email historically supported only 7-bit ASCII codes and would strip the 8th bit, thus corrupting binary data sent directly through any troublesome mail server.

After having learnt the basics of Tamil literature and grammar from his father Appan Iyengar and other scholars near his home town during his formative years, he moved to Ramanathapuram.\n\nIyengar learnt Sankrit literature and grammar from Pandalkudi Venkatachariar, tarka sastra from Samaacharyar and Vaishnava literature including Naalayira Divya Prabhandham from Sidhadikkaadu Srinivasachariar. He also learnt the Shaiva literature like Sivagyana bodham, Sivagyaana Sidhiyaar, Thevaaram, Tiruvasakam from Palanikumara Thambiraan of Thiruvaavaduthurai Aadheenam.\n\nHe, along with Paandithurai Thevar, zamindar of Paalavanatham did their residential education with Sadavadhaanam Muthuswamy Iyengar, father of Mu Raghava Iyengar. During his education, his versatility in both Sanskrit and Tamil literature, his knowledge of Astrology, medicine and tarka sastra impressed Paandithurai Thevar so much that he made him his official poet.\n\nIyengar translated the Sanskrit literature \"Jaathakachandrika\", a text on horoscope study in to Tamil (venpa yaappu) quartet poems on the request of the zamindar. This work was published and released by the zamindar in his court.\n\nIyengar also helped Paandithurai Thevar in publishing the Panoorthirattu.\n\nWhen Paandithurai Thevar established the Madurai Tamil Sangam on 24 May 1901, he assigned Iyengar management responsibilities in the Sangam for which he moved to Madurai.\n\nIyengar was in the management team of the Madurai Tamil Sangam since its inception. He was the first head of the Senthamil College institution and performed it for 45 years. Apart from that he also performed other functions – administrator, editor of Senthamizh magazine. Thiru Narayana Iyengar was the editor of the Senthamizh monthly from 1911. until his passing away in 1947.\n\nIt was during this period as Senthamizh editor that he did many research works in Tamil and Sanskrit literature and published his works in the monthly journal. His articles in the Senthamizh magazine on literature - Tamil and Sanskrit, grammar, tarka sastra, history and religion were informative to the readers. His expertise in these topics, his unbiased position in assessing the different points of view, his fearlessness to state the facts were well commended by the readers of Senthamizh. He published many such works in the magazine and which were later published as books.\n\nIn 1938, Iyengar wrote a paper titled Valmiki and Tamil in Senthamizh monthly, which analysed Maharishi Valmiki’s relationship with Tamil and whether Tamil could have been the spoken language throughout India during the Ramayana times.\n\nHis work Bharathazhwan Vaibhavam in the Senthamizh magazine was discussed in the Tamil literary circles. In that work, the detailed meaning given by Thiru Narayana Iyengar for the Kamban song that begins \"Vanthethire thozhuthaanai\" were refuted by Naavalar Somasundara Bharathiar. Thiru Narayana Iyengar’s reply to that rebuttal with detailed grammatical explanations and poetic nuances are even today a feast for the lovers of the Tamil language. He published both Naavalar’s objections and his explanations in the Senthamizh magazine.\n\nHe was in the education advisory committee of the Madras University, Annamalai University and the Yaazhpaana Arya Dravida Bhasha Abiviruthi Sangam. He was dedicated to Madurai Tamil Sangam and loyal to Paandithurai Thevar that he did not take up opportunities that came to him from other universities.\n\nDuring the 80th birthday celebrations of Ue. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer, Iyengar requested him to write his autobiography and that encouraged Ue. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer to write \"என் சரித்திரம்\". When Ue. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer retired from Annamalai University, Annamalai Chettiar requested Thiru Narayana Iyengar to join the university. Although more remunerative and in spite of Ue. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer requesting him, Thiru Narayana Iyengar turned it down since he derived very high satisfaction from his work at the Madurai Tamil Sangam. In his reply to Thiru Narayana Iyengar, Swaminatha Iyer quoted Thiruvalluvar’s kural - \"வேண்டாமை அன்ன விழுச்செல்வம்\" and said that he was the one with the greatest asset – needlessness.\n\nHere below are what some of the various Tamil literati had to say about him:\n\nNaavalar Somasundara Bharathiar said of him – \"நிரம்பிய இருமொழிக் கல்வியும் வரம்பளந்த அளவை நூலறிவும், நுண்மதியும், நடுவுநிலை திறம்பாத உளச் செம்மையும், சாந்த சீலமும் வாய்ந்த பெரியார் - a respectable elder with complete dual language knowledge, boundless knowledge of the books, refined sharp intelligence, unwavering judiciousness and equanimous\".\n\n\"இருமொழிப் பயிற்சியிலும், இலக்கணம் தர்க்கம் ஆகிய துறைகளிலும் அவரைப் போன்ற வித்வான்களைப் பார்க்க முடியாது - It is difficult to see an expert as good as him in dual language knowledge, grammar and logical reasoning\" said the head of the department of Tamil in Madras University, Rao Sahib Thiru S. Vaiyapuri Pillai.\n\n\"ஆசிரியர் செந்தமிழ் இதழில் வெளியிட்ட பொருளுரைகள் தமிழ்மொழி வளர்ச்சிக்கு இன்றியமையாதன - Senthamizh editor’s essays with detailed meanings were an important contribution for the growth of the Tamil language\" so said Sunnaakam A Kumaarasaami Pulavar.\n\nMu Raghava Iyengar of the Madurai Tamil Sangam had said \"நூற்றுக் கணக்கான மாணவர்களுக்கு தமிழறிவூட்டி அக்கல்வித் துறையைப் பரவச் செய்து தமிழக குலபதியாக விளங்கியவர் - Thiru Narayana Iyengar instilled the knowledge of Tamil literature to hundreds of students, was responsible for the growth of Tamil literature and can be called the leader\".\n\n1896 – During Queen Victoria Jubilee celebrations he won accolades for his contributions to Tamil from the Deputy-Collector Rajaramaiyya\n\n1922 Jan 13 Madras government awarded him a golden armlet, gold medal and shawl from the Prince of Wales for his literary eminence in Tamil\n\n1934 for the 33rd anniversary of Madurai Tamil Sangam, awarded the cash prize and shawl for his contributions to Tamil Sangam by the Governor of Chennai Muhamad Usman Sahib Bahadur\n\n1945 - Ruler of Sethu Shanmuga Raajeswara Naaganaatha Sethupathi awarded the Gold medal and silk shawl\n\nListed below are some of the papers and books written by Thiru Narayana Iyengar.

{"id": "274439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274439", "title": "X11 color names", "text": "X11 color names\n\nIn computing, on the X Window System, X11 color names are represented in a simple text file, which maps certain strings to RGB color values. It was traditionally shipped with every X11 installation, hence the name, and is usually located in codice_1. The web colors list is descended from it but differs for certain color names.\n\nColor names are not standardized by Xlib or the X11 protocol. The list does not show continuity either in selected color values or in color names, and some color triplets have multiple names. Despite this, graphic designers and others got used to them, making it practically impossible to introduce a different list. In earlier releases of X11 (prior to the introduction of Xcms), server implementors were encouraged to modify the RGB values in the reference color database to account for gamma correction.\n\nAs of X.Org Release 7.4 rgb.txt is no longer included in the roll up release, and the list is built directly into the server. The optional module xorg/app/rgb contains the stand-alone rgb.txt file.\n\nThe list first shipped with X10 release 3 (X10R3) on 7 June 1986, having been checked into RCS by Jim Gettys in 1985. The same list was in X11R1 on 18 September 1987. Approximately the full list as is available today shipped with X11R4 on 29 January 1989, with substantial additions by Paul Ravelling (who added colors based on Sinclair Paints samples), John C. Thomas (who added colors based on a set of 72 Crayola crayons he had on hand) and Jim Fulton (who reconciled contributions to produce the X11R4 list). The project was running DEC VT240 terminals at the time, so would have worked to that device.\n\nIn some applications multipart names are written with spaces, in others joined together, often in camel case. They are usually matched insensitive of case and the X Server source code contains spaced aliases for most entries; this article uses spaces and uppercase initials except where variants with spaces are not specified in the actual code.\n\nThe first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 colors as the basis for the web colors list, as both were originally X applications. The W3C specifications SVG and CSS level 3 module Color eventually adopted the X11 list with some changes. The present W3C list is a superset of the 16 “VGA colors” defined in HTML 3.2 and CSS level 1.\n\nPerhaps most unusual of the color clashes between X11 and W3C is the case of \"Gray\" and its variants. In HTML, \"Gray\" is specifically reserved for the 128 triplet (50% gray) . However, in X11, \"gray\" was assigned to the 190 triplet (74.5%) , which is close to W3C \"Silver\" at 192 (75.3%) , and had \"Light Gray\" at 211 (83%) and \"Dark Gray\" at 169 (66%) counterparts. As a result, the combined CSS 3.0 color list that prevails on the web today produces \"Dark Gray\" as a significantly lighter tone than plain \"Gray\" , because \"Dark Gray\" was descended from X11 – for it did not exist in HTML nor CSS level 1 – while \"Gray\" was descended from HTML. Even in the current draft for CSS 4.0, dark gray continues to be a lighter shade than gray. Some browsers such as Netscape Navigator insisted on an \"a\" in any \"Gr\"a\"y\" except for \"Light Gr\"e\"y\".\n\nRecent X releases also support the W3C definitions. In X11, the original definitions have been preserved (so \"Dark Gray\" remains a darker shade of \"Gray\"), but for every conflicting name pair, \"Web\" and additional \"X11\" prefixes have been added to ease disambiguation after the merger. The \"X11\" prefix is an alias for the non-prefixed version, i.e. \"X11 Gray\" = \"Gray\" ≠ \"Web Gray\". The W3C also defined a color that is equal to X11's \"Green\", but called it \"Lime\". In X11, this is simply called \"Lime\", as no such name existed before. It aliases to \"Green\", i.e. \"Lime\" = \"Green\" = \"X11 Green\" ≠ \"Web Green\".\n\nThe following chart presents the standardized X11 color names from the X.org source code. The list of names accepted by browsers following W3C standards slightly differs as explained above. The table does not show numbered gray and brightness variants as described below. Actual codice_2 files and other color databases or palettes may differ since they are freely editable by vendors and users. The table shows component values in several notations of the RGB color space, i.e. RGB, HSL and HSV, conversions are done assuming sRGB color space.\n\nThe complete codice_2 defines 101 shades from 'Gray0' (black) up to 'Gray100' (white) in addition to 'Gray' and its variants listed above. The shades are apparently defined by the formula codice_4 resulting in e.g. 'Gray96' , which happens to be the same as 'White Smoke'. Similarly 'Dim Gray' is the same as 'Gray41' .\n\nOn the other hand, 'Gray' lies between 'Gray74' and 'Gray75' ; 'Dark Gray' is not the same as 'Gray66' ; and 'Light Gray' is not the same as 'Gray83' .\n\nThese shades are not included in W3C specifications, although drafts for level 4 of the CSS Color module include a similar function codice_5.\nThey are still coded without 'Grey' alternatives, but with no space before the digit.\n\nFor 78 colors (not counting grays), codice_2 offers four variants \"\"color\"1\", \"\"color\"2\", \"\"color\"3\", and \"\"color\"4\", with \"\"color\"1\" sometimes corresponding to \"color\", so e.g. \"Snow1\" is the same as \"Snow\". Unlike base colors, e.g. codice_7 and codice_8, these are only coded without spaces, e.g. codice_9. These variations are neither supported by popular browsers nor adopted by W3C standards. Whether or not a certain color has such variants seems random.\n\nIf \"\"color\"1\" is not the same as \"\"color\", the base color is usually darker. That means its brightness in HSB color notation is less than 100%; about 30 of the base colors are fully bright. The four variants (1…4) have rounded brightness values of 100%, 93%, 80% and 55%, respectively. Their hue and saturation are usually the same except for rounding. In some cases they differ from the base color, though, which may indicate that these variants were specified with alternate definitions of the bases in mind, i.e. their values were adapted to a certain monitor which was commonly done by vendors until the 1990s.\n\nThe fixed brightness settings correspond closely to these formulae to determine the RGB values:\n\nExamples:\n\nSome color names appear to be brightness or saturation modifications of others because they bear prefixes such as \"Dark, Light, Medium, Pale\" or \"Deep\", but there is no systematic variation apparent. Several sets, however, feature a \"Dark\" variant with 55% brightness and some have their \"Medium\" at about 80%.\n\n\"Light Goldenrod Yellow\" and \"Dark Olive Green\" are special, because there are no corresponding color entries without \"Dark\" and \"Light\" prefixes.\n\nSeveral groups of colors share the same lightness or brightness and saturation. These \"nuances\" differ only by hue.\n\n\nSeveral groups of colors share the same hue and HSL saturation. \"Tints\" are lighter than a base color, \"shades\" are darker.\n\n\nSome pairs of colors share the same lightness and hue. These \"tones\" differ only by saturation. Tones are far less common in the X11 set than nuances, tints and shades.\n\n\nThe Printer Working Group (PWG) of the IEEE publishes a standard, PWG 5101.1, whose mandatory color names are based upon RFC 3805, successor to RFC 1759 which imported the functional color names \"other\", \"unknown\" and \"transparent\" alongside seven basic colors from ISO 10175 (DPA) and ISO 10180 (SPDL), and JTAPI. This standard has four variants for each non-monochromatic color: \"clear\" (50% transparent), \"dark\", \"light\" and the default. Wherever possible, the values are the same as in the W3C adaptation of the X11 list, except for Turquoise which is instead of . Missing variant values have been added systematically. \"Buff\" and \"Mustard\" are completely new color names. Light Black and Gray correspond to the same color.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "505256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505256", "title": "Zarma language", "text": "Zarma language\n\nZarma (also spelled Djerma, Dyabarma, Dyarma, Dyerma, Adzerma, Zabarma, Zarbarma, Zarma, Zarmaci or Zerma) is one of the Songhay languages. It is the leading indigenous language of the southwestern lobe of the West African nation of Niger, where the Niger River flows and the capital city, Niamey, is located. Zarma is the second-most common language in the country, after Hausa, which is spoken in south-central Niger. With over 2 million speakers, Zarma is easily the most widely spoken Songhay language.\n\nIn earlier decades, Zarma was known as \"Djerma\", and it is still sometimes called \"Zerma\", especially among French-speakers, but it is usually now called Zarma, the name that its speakers use in their own language.\n\nThe Zarma alphabet uses the following letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, ɲ (or ny), ŋ, o, p, r, s, t, u, w, y, z. Also, v may be used in a few words of foreign origin, but many Zarma cannot pronounce it.\n\nMost of the letters are pronounced with the same values as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the exceptions being (approximately English \"j\" but more palatalized), , (a flap). The letter is approximately like English \"ch\" but more palatalized. The palatal nasal is sometimes spelled .\n\nLong consonants are written with double letters; is a trilled . Long vowels are sometimes but inconsistently written with double letter. Nasal vowels are written with a tilde or a following or . In older works, was spelled or . Both and are pronounced as a labiodental nasal before .\n\nTone is not written unless the word is ambiguous. Then, the standard IPA diacritics are used: \"bá\" (\"to be a lot\": high tone), \"bà\" (\"to share\": low tone), \"bâ\" (\"to want\" or \"even\": falling tone) and \"bǎ\" (\"to be better\": rising tone). However, the meaning is almost always unambiguous in the context so the words are usually all written \"ba\".\n\nThere are ten vowels: the five oral vowels (, , , , ) and their nasalized counterparts. There is slight variation, both allophonic and dialectal. Vowel length is phonemically distinctive. There are a number of combinations of a vowel with a semivowel or , the semivowel being initial or final.\n\nThe combinations and usually have some palatal quality to them and may even be interchangeable with and in the speech of many people.\n\nAll consonants may be short, and all consonants except /c/, /h/, /f/ and /z/ may be long. (In some dialects, long /f/ exists in the word \"goffo\".)\n\nZarma is a tonal language with four tones: high, low, fall and rise. In Dosso, some linguists (such as Tersis) have observed a dipping (falling-rising) tone for certain words: \"ma\" (\"the name\").\n\nStress is generally unimportant in Zarma. According to Abdou Hamani (1980), two-syllable words are stressed on their first syllable unless that syllable is just a short vowel: a-, i- or u-. Three-syllable words have stress on their second syllable. The first consonant of a stressed syllable is pronounced a bit more strongly, and the vowel in the preceding syllable is weakened. Only emphasized words have a stressed syllable. There is no change of tone for a stressed syllable.\n\nThere are many suffixes in Zarma. There are very few prefixes, and only one (\"a-/i-\" before adjectives and numbers) is common.\n\nNouns may be singular or plural. There are also three \"forms\" that indicate whether the noun is indefinite, definite or demonstrative. \"Form\" and number are indicated conjointly by an enclitic on the noun phrase. The singular definite enclitic is -ǒ or -ǎ. Some authors always write the ending with a rising tone mark even if it is not ambiguous and even if it is not truly a rising tone. The other endings are in the table below. The definite and the demonstrative endings replace any final vowel. See Hamani (1980) for a discussion on when to add -ǒ or -ǎ as well as other irregularities. See Tersis (1981) for a discussion of the complex changes in tone that may occur.\nFor example, \"súsúbày\" means \"morning\" (indefinite singular); \"súsúbǎ\" means \"the morning\" (definite singular); and \"súsúbô\" means \"this morning\" (demonstrative singular).\n\nThe indefinite plural -yáŋ ending is often used like English \"some\". \"Ay no leemuyaŋ\" means \"Give me some oranges.\" Usually, the singular forms are used if the plurality is indicated by a number or other contextual clue, especially for the indefinite form: \"Soboro ga ba\" (\"There are a lot of mosquitoes\"); \"ay zanka hinkǎ\" (\"my two children\"); \"hasaraw hinko kulu ra\" (\"in both of these catastrophes\").\n\nThere is no gender or case in Zarma so the third-person singular pronoun \"a\" can mean \"he\", \"she\", \"it\", \"her\", \"him\", \"his\", \"hers\", \"its\", \"one\" or \"one's\", according to the context and its position in the sentence.\n\nVerbs do not have tenses and are not conjugated. There are at least three aspects for verbs that are indicated by a modal word before the verb and any object nouns. The aspects are the completive (\"daahir gasu\"), the incompletive (\"daahir gasu si\") and the subjunctive (\"afiri ŋwaaray nufa\"). (Beginning grammars for foreigners sometimes inaccurately call the first two \"past and present tenses\".) There is also an imperative and a continuing or progressive construction. Lack of a modal marker indicates either the affirmative completive aspect (if there is a subject and no object) or the singular affirmative imperative (if there is no subject). There is a special modal marker, \"ka\" or \"ga\", according to the dialect, to indicate the completive aspect with emphasis on the subject. Different markers are used to indicate a negative sentence.\nLinguists do not agree on the tone for \"ga\". Some say that it is high before a low tone and low before a high tone.\n\nThere are several words in Zarma to translate the English \"to be\". The defective verb \"tí\" is used to equate two noun phrases, with the emphasized completive \"ka/ga\", as in \"Ay ma ka ti Yakuba\" (\"My name is Yakuba\"). The existential \"gǒ\" (negative \"sí\") is not a verb (White-Kaba, 1994, calls it a \"verboid\") and has no aspect; it means \"exist\" and usually links a noun phrase to a descriptive term, such as a place, a price or a participle: \"A go fuwo ra\" (\"She's in the house\"). The predicative \"nô\" means \"it is\", \"they are\", etc. and is one of the most common words in Zarma. It has no aspect or negative form and is placed after a noun phrase, sometimes for emphasis: \"Ni do no ay ga koy\" (\"It's to your house I'm going\"). Other words, such as \"gòró\", \"cíyà\", \"tíyà\" and \"bárà\" are much rarer and usually express ideas, such as the subjunctive, which \"gǒ\" and \"tí\" cannot handle.\n\nParticiples can be formed with the suffix \"-ànté\", which is similar in meaning to the past participle in English. It can also be added to quantities to form ordinal numbers and to some nouns to form adjectives. A sort of gerund can be formed by adding \"-yàŋ\", which transforms the verb into a noun. There are many other suffixes that can make nouns out of verbs, but only \"-yàŋ\" works with all verbs.\n\nTwo verbs can be related with the word \"ká\". (In many dialects it is \"gá\", not to be confused with the incompletive aspect marker or the emphasized completive marker.) The connector \"ká\" implies that the second verb is a result of the first or that the first is the reason or cause of the second: \"ka ga ŋwa\", \"come (in order to) eat.\" A large number of idiomatic expressions are expressed with it: \"sintin ga ...\" or \"sintin ka\" means \"to begin to ...\", \"ban ga ...\" means \"to have already ...\", \"ba ga ...\" means \"to be about to ..., \"gay ga ...\" means \"it's been awhile since ...\", \"haw ga ...\" means \"to purposely ...\" and so on.\n\nZarma's normal word order is subject–object–verb. The object is normally placed before the verb but may be placed after the verb for emphasis, and a few common verbs require the object after them. Unlike English, which places prepositions before a noun, Zarma has postpositions, which are placed after the noun: \"fuwo ra\" (in the house), \"fuwo jine\" (in front of the house).\n\nWhen two nouns are placed together, the first noun modifies the second, showing possession, purpose or description: \"Fati tirǎ\" (Fati's book), \"haŋyaŋ hari\" (drinking water), \"fu meeyo\" (the door of a house). The same construction occurs with a pronoun before a noun: \"ni baaba\" (\"your father\"). All other modifiers of a noun (adjectives, articles, numbers, demonstratives etc.) are placed after the noun: \"Ay baaba wura muusu boŋey\" (\"My father’s gold lion heads\", Tersis, 1981).\n\nHere is a proverb in Zarma:\n\n\"Da curo fo hẽ, afo mana hẽ, i si jinde kaana bay.\"\n\nThat means that \"you need to hear both sides of the story\".\n\n\n\n"}

For example, the double genitive in \"Vemses flicka/pojke är du då?\" (\"\"Whose's\" girl/boy are you?\" (\"Vems flicka/pojke är du då\" in Standard Swedish)) carries the implication that the asker might know the parents of the person asked, likely in a small society such as Åland. Another characteristic is the substitution of \"inte\" (not) with \"inga\" (no, nobody, none; in Standard Swedish a plural form): \"Jag har inga varit där\" (\"I have not been there\").\n\nA feature that Åland Swedish shares with Finland Swedish is the reduction of the words \"inte\" (not), \"skulle\" (should) and \"måste\" (must) to \"int\", \"sku\" and \"måst\" respectively.\n\nThe dialectal vocabulary of Åland Swedish is composed of words that are either characteristic of Eastern Swedish or have passed out of use (but are still understood) in the Swedish spoken in Sweden. Traces of Finnish, Russian and English can also be found in the dialect because of historical contact.\n\nBelow is a selection of dialectal words and expressions used in Åland Swedish:\n\n\n\n"}
