Arun Kamble, President and one of the founding members of Dalit Panther, worked as a Head of Marathi department at University of Mumbai. He was the National General Secretary of Janata Dal. He took many major decisions in favour of Dalit, Backward Class and Minorities.\n\nKamble formed Dalit Panther of India as a social organisation alongside Namdeo Dhasal and Raja Dhale in 1976. Later Kamble became the National General Secretary of Janata Dal and worked with former Prime Minister V.P. Singh. He demanded the renaming of Marathwada University to \"Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar University\". Kamble, a writer, poet and editor, authored many books such as \"Cultural Struggle in Ramayana\", \"Conversion of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar\", \"Cheevar\", \"Vaad-Samvad\", \"Yug-Pravartak Ambedkar\", \"Chalvaliche Diwas\", and \"Tarkateerth Ek Vadato-Vyaghyat\". He was awarded with many accolades such as \"The Prabuddha Ratna Puraskar\", Life Time Achievement International Award. Some of his works have been translated into English, German, French, Gujarati, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Urdu (Dalit Awaaz) and Hindi (Suraj ke Vansh-dhar).\n\nKamble was born on 14 March 1953, in Mahar Dalit family of village-Kargani, Atpadi near Sangli. He was a follower of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar as Dr.Ambedkar was an inspiration to him.His mother and father both were School Headmaster in Sangli. His mother (Shantabai Kamble) and father (Krushnaji Kamble) have written autobiographies called \"Majya Jalmachi Chittarkatha\" and \"Mi Krushna\" respectively. His father was a well known personality in Kargani district.\n\nHis school days were in Athapadi and Dighanchi at Sangli. He completed B.A. (honors) from Willingdon College, Deccan Education Society, Sangli in 1974. Later he earned his M.A. from Siddhartha College in 1976 with distinction in \"Shodhnibandh ani Shodhnibandhachi Lekhan Paddhati\". His major interests were Dalit literature and Ambedkarite Movement.\n\nHe joined Dr. Ambedkar College of Commerce and Economics, Wadala, Mumbai in 1976 as a lecturer of Marathi (1976–1985). Later he joined Kirti College, Dadar (W), Mumbai (1985–1989). In 1990 he joined the University of Mumbai as a \"Reader\". Until his death he was a PhD Guide in Marathi Department and also was Head of Phule, Shahu Chair in University of Mumbai.\n\nKamble was the National President and one of the founding members of Dalit Panther. He was also the National General Secretary of Janata Dal, a member of the National Election Committee – Janata Dal (Parliamentary Board), and in charge of Election Committee of Bihar State. He successfully led the Namantar Andolan of Marathwada University as a president of Dalit Panther of India.\n\nWhen the dispute arose on the book 'Riddles in Hinduism' (Appendix, Riddles of Ram & Krishna) authored by Dr.Ambedkar, Kamble led an intellectual fight and a march with Ten Lakh people (January 1987) and the provision for reservation to Buddhist, Backward class, and minorities with Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh. He got promises and assurance to implement the Mandal Commission;Second Backward class Commission, with an immediate effect (1989).\n\nKamble resigned from Janata Dal on the issue of Dalit president of India. He led a march as a President of Dalit Panther during an Assembly Session at Nagpur on the issue of publishing Dr. Ambedkar's complete body of literature (1979). He later worked as a member of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Charitra Sadhane Publication which was borne by a march.\n\nKamble worked as an editor for the book \"Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Writings & Speeches\". Maharashtra Government declared a decision to omit a part from the Appendix (Riddles in Hinduism, 'Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Writings and Speeches' Volume 4). For this issue he left the editor's committee and filed a lawsuit in the High Court against the Maharashtra Government.\n\nHe inaugurated 'Manusmruti Cremation Conference' at Karur by Dravida Kazhagam, founded by Periyar E. V. Ramasamy (1983). He also inaugurated and led a march to protest against the outrageous behavior on Dalit community at Karamchedu (1987). He led Samajik Nyay Jyoti (Social Justice Flame) with Ram Vilas Paswan from Chundur to New Delhi (1992).\nHe was the Chief Guest at 'All India Dalit Writer's Conference' (October 1987) and worked as a convener of the 'All India Dalit Writer's Association. He inaugurated a Social Gathering of Dalit Literature at Bangalore (1986) and gave a speech at the conference of the Namantar-Mandal (1984). He inaugurated the 9th Marathi Conference at Badoda (1995) and gave a speech at the All India Dalit Liberation conference (6 December 1987). He undertook an editorial work for the periodicals \"Ambedkar Bharat\", \"Shoonya\", and \"Sangharsh\".\n\nKamble worked as a member of National Police Commission and as a committee member for the advisory board of Special Department for Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribes at the University of Mumbai. He was a president of 3rd All India Conference on Dr. Ambedkar's Literature at Wardha and also a president at the World Conference on Buddha, Phule, and Ambedkar Literature at Kalyan ( 23–25 March 2002).\n\n\n\n\n\nKamble was found dead in a lake at Hyderabad. News of his suspected death in a mysterious manner came as a major shock to his friends in socio-political circles. Kamble had gone to Hyderabad on 13 December 2009 to take part in an International Seminar at Birla Scientific Institute in Saifabad and went missing the next day.\n\n"}

The involvement of a bankable star in a film gives investors confidence that they will achieve a return on their investments by ensuring that the film is widely distributed and that at least some people will pay to see it (that it will \"open\").\n\nHarris adds that obtaining a bankable star for a package is not easy because of the dearth of such stars. He states that at any point in time there are no more than \"a dozen or so\" stars whose mere involvement will ensure that a film will be made.\n\nAnalyst Alex Epstein states that bankable stars or, more generally, \"bankable elements\" are how \"hookless\" films (films without a compelling concept that makes people interested in them in their own right) get made. He gives \"Dances with Wolves\" as an example of a movie: the involvement of Kevin Costner as the bankable star guaranteed that the movie was made. Writer Melissa Robbie concurs, stating that some movies are high-concept (they have what Epstein terms \"hooks\"), but others are simply star vehicles for bankable stars.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" has published several results of polls for Hollywood's top ten most bankable stars, the most recent three being one in 1999, one in 2002 and the last one in 2006.\n\nThe 2002 survey polled \"114 executives at both major studios and independent companies, financiers and various industry players from around the world.\" Voters were asked which stars \"did the most to attract financing to a film, ensure its global distribution, and deliver that hugely important opening weekend based on the strength of their good name.\"\n\nJames Ulmer has compared his list of bankable stars, \"The Ulmer Scale\", to a stock market index. His criteria for ranking is based on the name of a star alone being able to get people to movie theaters in the United States as well as the rest of the world. In an August 2010 interview Ulmer described the international movie market as \"unfortunately ... pretty sexist\"; how a woman's name alone cannot sell a movie, and how female stars are only bankable when cast with a male star or in ensemble movies.\n\nThese are the top 10 lists of the most bankable stars, with their scores, as published by \"The Hollywood Reporter\".\n\n\nThe list was created by veteran entertainment journalist James Ulmer, who developed a 100-point method to quantify a star's value to a film production, in terms of getting a movie financed and the cameras rolling. \"The Ulmer Scale\" also takes into account an actor's history (box office successes vs. failures), versatility, professional demeanor, and ability and willingness to travel and promote movies.\n\nThe Top 10 list as of 2009 (in order of 'bankable' value):\n\n\n"}

He served as Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley from 1981 to 2003 after having also held teaching appointments at Stanford University, Rockefeller University, Princeton University, and the University of Chicago. Davidson was known for his charismatic personality and the depth and difficulty of his thought. His work exerted considerable influence in many areas of philosophy from the 1960s onward, particularly in philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and action theory. While Davidson was an analytic philosopher, and most of his influence lies in that tradition, his work has attracted attention in continental philosophy as well, particularly in literary theory and related areas.\n\nAlthough published mostly in the form of short, terse essays that do not explicitly rely on any overriding theory, his work is nonetheless noted for a highly unified character, the same methods and ideas brought to bear on a host of apparently unrelated problems, and for synthesizing the work of a great number of other philosophers. He developed an influential truth-conditional semantics, attacked the idea of mental events as governed by strict psychological laws, and rejected the conception of linguistic understanding as having to do with conventions or rules, concluding famously that \"there is no such thing as a language, not if a language is anything like what many philosophers and linguists have supposed. There is therefore no such thing to be learned, mastered, or born with.\" His philosophical work, as a whole, is said to be concerned with how human beings communicate and interact with one another.\n\nDavidson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on March 6, 1917, to Clarence (\"Davie\") Herbert Davidson and Grace Cordelia Anthony. The family lived in the Philippines from shortly after Davidson's birth until he was about 4. Then, having lived in Amherst and Philadelphia, the family finally settled on Staten Island when Davidson was 9 or 10. He then began to attend public school and had to begin in first grade with much younger children. He then attended the Staten Island Academy, starting in fourth grade.\n\nAt Harvard University, he switched his major from English and comparative literature (Theodore Spencer on William Shakespeare and the Bible, Harry Levin on James Joyce) to classics and philosophy. Among his influences was Alfred North Whitehead; Davidson said that \"Whitehead took me under his wing; he would invite me to his apartment for afternoon tea all the time.\" He graduated in 1939, with a B.A. \"magna cum laude\".\n\nDavidson was a pianist and always had an interest in music, later teaching philosophy of music at Stanford. At Harvard, he was in the same class as the conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, with whom Davidson played piano four hands. Bernstein wrote and conducted the musical score for the production which Davidson mounted of Aristophanes' play \"The Birds\" in the original Greek. Some of the music was later to be reused in Bernstein's ballet \"Fancy Free\".\n\nAfter graduation, he went to California, where he wrote radio scripts for the private-eye drama \"Big Town\", starring Edward G. Robinson. He returned to Harvard on a scholarship in classical philosophy, teaching philosophy and concurrently undergoing the intensive training of Harvard Business School. Before he had the opportunity to graduate from Harvard Business School, Davidson was called up by the US Navy, for which he had volunteered. He trained pilots to recognize enemy planes and participated in the invasions of Sicily, Salerno, and Anzio. After three and a half years in the Navy, he tried unsuccessfully to write a novel before returning to his philosophy studies and earning his doctorate in philosophy in 1949 under Raphael Demos and Donald Williams. Plato's \"Philebus\" was the topic of his dissertation.\n\nUnder the influence of W. V. O. Quine, whom he often credited as his mentor, he began to gradually turn toward the more formal methods and precise problems characteristic of analytic philosophy.\n\nIn the 1950s, Davidson worked with Patrick Suppes on developing an experimental approach to Decision Theory. They concluded that it was not possible to isolate a subject's beliefs and preferences independently of one another so there would always be multiple ways to analyze a person's actions in terms of what they wanted or were trying to do or valued. That result was comparable to Quine's thesis on the indeterminacy of translation and figured significantly in much of Davidson's later work on philosophy of mind.\n\nHis most noted work (see below) was published in a series of essays from the 1960s onward, moving successively through philosophy of action into philosophy of mind and philosophy of language, and dabbling occasionally in aesthetics, philosophical psychology, and the history of philosophy.\n\nDavidson was widely traveled and had a great range of interests he pursued with enormous energy. Apart from playing the piano, he had a pilot's license, built radios, and he was fond of mountain climbing and surfing.\n\nHe was married three times. His first wife was the artist Virginia Davidson, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, Elizabeth (Davidson) Boyer. Following his divorce from Virginia Davidson, he married for the second time to Nancy Hirschberg, Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and later at Chicago Circle. She died in 1979. In 1984, Davidson married for the third and last time, to philosopher Marcia Cavell.\n\nHe served terms as president of both the Eastern and Western Divisions of the American Philosophical Association, and held various professional positions at Queens College (now part of CUNY), Stanford (1961-1967), Princeton (1967-1970), Rockefeller University (1970-1976), and the University of Chicago (1976-1981). From 1981 to his death he was at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor of Philosophy. In 1995, he was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize.\n\nDavidson's most noted work began in 1963 with an essay, \"Actions, Reasons, and Causes,\" which attempted to refute the prevailing orthodox view, widely attributed to Ludwig Wittgenstein but already present in Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", that an agent's reasons for acting cannot be the causes of his action (Malpas, 2005, §2). Instead, Davidson argued that, \"rationalization (the providing of reasons to explain an agent's actions) is a species of ordinary causal explanation\" (1963, p. 685). In particular, action \"A\" is explained by what Davidson called a \"primary reason\", which involves a pro-attitude (roughly, a desire) toward some goal \"G\" and an instrumental belief that performing action \"A\" is a means to attaining \"G\". For example, someone's primary reason for taking an umbrella outside on a rainy day might be that wanting to stay dry and believing that taking an umbrella is a means to stay dry today.\n\nThis view, which largely conforms to common-sense folk psychology, was held in part on the ground that while causal laws must be strict and deterministic, explanation in terms of reasons need not. Davidson argued that the fact that the expression of a reason was not so precise did not mean that the having of a reason could not itself be a state capable of causally influencing behavior. Several other essays pursue consequences of this view and elaborate Davidson's theory of actions.\n\nIn \"Mental Events\" (1970) Davidson advanced a form of token identity theory about the mind: token mental events are identical to token physical events. One previous difficulty with such a view was that it did not seem feasible to provide laws relating mental states, like believing that the sky is blue or wanting a hamburger, to physical states, such as patterns of neural activity in the brain. Davidson argued that such a reduction would not be necessary to a token identity thesis: it is possible that each individual mental event just is the corresponding physical event, without there being laws relating \"types\" (as opposed to tokens) of mental events to \"types\" of physical events. Davidson argued that the fact that no such a reduction could be had does not entail that the mind is anything \"more\" than the brain. Hence, Davidson called his position anomalous monism: monism, because it claims that only one thing is at issue in questions of mental and physical events; anomalous (from \"a-\", \"not,\" and \"omalos\", \"regular\") because mental and physical event \"types\" could not be connected by strict laws (laws without exceptions).\n\nDavidson argued that anomalous monism follows from three plausible theses. Firstly, he assumes the \"denial of epiphenomenalism\", the denial of the view that mental events do not cause physical events. Secondly, he assumes a \"nomological view of causation\", according to which one event causes another if (and only if) there is a strict, exceptionless law governing the relation between the events. Thirdly, he assumes the principle of the \"anomalism of the mental\", according to which there are no strict laws that govern the relationship between mental event types and physical event types. By these three theses, Davidson argued, it follows that the causal relations between the mental and the physical hold only between mental event tokens, but mental events as types are anomalous. That ultimately secures token physicalism and a supervenience relation between the mental and the physical, while respecting the autonomy of the mental (Malpas, 2005, §2).\n\nIn 1967 Davidson published \"Truth and Meaning,\" in which he argued that any \"learnable\" language must be statable in a finite form even if it is capable of a theoretically infinite number of expressions, as may be assumed that natural human languages are, at least in principle. If it could not be stated in a finite way, it could not be learned through a finite, empirical method such as the way humans learn their languages. It follows that it must be possible to give a theoretical semantics for any natural language that could give the meanings of an infinite number of sentences on the basis of a finite system of axioms. Following, among others, Rudolf Carnap (\"Introduction to Semantics\", Harvard 1942, 22) Davidson also argued that \"giving the meaning of a sentence\" was equivalent to stating its truth conditions, so stimulating the modern work on truth-conditional semantics. To sum up, he proposed that it must be possible to distinguish a finite number of distinct grammatical features of a language, and for each of them explain its workings in such a way as to generate trivial (obviously correct) statements of the truth conditions of all the (infinitely many) sentences making use of that feature. Thus, a finite theory of meaning can be given for a natural language; the test of its correctness is that it would generate (if applied to the language in which it was formulated) all the sentences of the form \"'p' is true if and only if p\" (\"'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white\"). (They are called T-sentences: Davidson derives the idea from Alfred Tarski.)\n\nThis work was originally delivered in his John Locke Lectures at Oxford and launched a large endeavor by many philosophers to develop Davidsonian semantical theories for natural language. Davidson himself contributed many details to such a theory, in essays on quotation, indirect discourse, and descriptions of action.\n\nAfter the 1970s Davidson's philosophy of mind picked up influences from the work of Saul Kripke, Hilary Putnam, and Keith Donnellan, all of whom had proposed a number of troubling counterexamples to what can be generally described as \"descriptivist\" theories of content. The views, which roughly originate in Bertrand Russell's Theory of Descriptions, held that the referent of a name, which object or person the name refers to, is determined by the beliefs a person holds about that object. Kripke et al. argued that this was not a tenable theory, and that in fact whom or what a person's beliefs were about was in large part (or entirely) a matter of how they had acquired those beliefs, and those names, and how if at all the use of those names could be traced \"causally\" from their original referents to the current speaker.\n\nDavidson picked up this theory, and his work in the 1980s dealt with the problems in relating first-person beliefs to second- and third-person beliefs. It seems that first person beliefs (\"I am hungry\") are acquired in very different ways from third person beliefs (someone else's belief, of me, that \"He is hungry\"). How can it be that they have the same content?\n\nDavidson approached the question by connecting it with another one: how can two people have beliefs about the same external object? He offers, in answer, a picture of triangulation: beliefs about oneself, beliefs about other people, and beliefs about the world come into existence jointly.\n\nMany philosophers throughout history had, arguably, been tempted to reduce two of these kinds of belief and knowledge to the other one: René Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.\n\nDavidson's work is well noted for its unity, as he has brought a similar approach to a wide variety of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.\n\nThe significance of this conclusion is that it allows Davidson to draw on the work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question can be answered affirmatively.\n\nDavidson points out that beliefs and meanings are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true based on what he believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter knew what a person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything about a particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time.\n\nDavidson argues that because the language is compositional, it is also holistic: sentences are based on the meanings of words, but the meaning of a word depends on the totality of sentences in which it appears. That holistic constraint, along with the requirement that the theory of truth is law-like, suffices to minimize indeterminacy just enough for successful communication to occur.\n\nIn summary, what radical interpretation highlights is what is necessary and sufficient for communication to occur. The conditions are to recognize speakers \"as\" speakers, their beliefs must be mostly coherent and correct; indeterminacy of meaning does not undermine communication, but it must be constrained just enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a passionate orator, but somewhat inconsistent in his politics.\n\nEdgar Raoul Raoul-Duval was born on 9 April 1832 in Laon, Aisne.\nHis father was Charles-Edmond Raoul-Duval (1807–93), a senator from 1876 to 1879.\nHis father's surname was originally Duval, later changed to Raoul-Duval.\nHis mother was Octavie Say (1804–65).\nShe was the daughter of the economist Jean-Baptiste Say, and he was the cousin of Léon Say.\nHe was a Protestant.\nHis father and grandfather were both magistrates.\n\nRaoul-Duval completed his law studies and in 1853 was appointed a substitute magistrate in Nantes at a very early age.\nOn 8 January 1857 at Le Havre he married Catherine Foerster (1834–1922).\nTheir children were Marianne (1857–1940), Valentine (1860–1932), Edmond (1862–1932) and André (1870–1927).\nEdgar Raoul-Duval was in turn advocate-general at Angers, at Bordeaux, and from 1866 to 1870 at Rouen.\nHe resigned on 4 September 1870 to register at the bar in Rouen as a prelude to entering militant politics.\n\nRaoul-Duval ran unsuccessfully for election to the legislature on 8 February 1871.\nHe was elected later that year as conservative candidate in a by-election for Seine-Inférieure, where there were four vacant seats.\nHe was a representative in the National Assembly for Seine-Inférieure from 2 July 1871 to 7 March 1876, and sat with the Union des Droites parliamentary group.\nHe later joined the Appel au peuple group.\n\nRaoul-Duval was soon one of the most active deputies of the conservative majority and one of its favorite speakers.\nHe adopted Montesquieu's definition, \"Freedom is the right to do anything the law does not prohibit.\"\nRaoul-Duval was rather inconsistent in his politics.\nA critic wrote of him, \"M. Raoul Duval has plenty of \"entrain\", of \"élan\", of fire, of repartee, but he lacks the power of continued pursuance of one subject. ... He begins with a good and substantial address; he finishes with rolling fire of passionate responses to attacks hurled at him.\"\nRaoul-Duval was responsible for forcing the retirement from office of the Minister of the Interior, Victor Lefranc.\nHe did not succeed in an attack on the treaty Adolphe Thiers had made with Germany after the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nIn 1872 Raoul-Duval intervened in several important debates.\nOn economic questions Raoul Duval always defended the principles of free trade.\nHe opposed the first constitutional laws and the \"great council\" proposed by Albert de Broglie, and also fought the proposal to extend the powers of Marshal MacMahon for seven years.\nHe once said that any person who ventured to hint at dissolution was fit to be classed with Communists.\nHowever, several times between 1873 and 1875, when he sat with the Bonapartist group, he called for the dissolution of the Chamber.\nHe demanded a plebiscite to sanction the constitution, and voted against the constitutional laws on 25 February 1875.\n\nIn the 1876 legislative elections Raoul-Duval ran both in the 8th arrondissement of Paris and in the Louviers district of Eure.\nHe failed in Paris but was elected in the second round in Louviers.\nHe rejoined the Bonapartist group.\nHe was rapporteur of the budget of the navy and colonies for 1877, and intervened several times in the budget discussions.\nAfter the 16 May 1877 crisis he was one of 11 deputies who abstained from the vote of confidence requested by the Broglie ministry.\nHe held office until 25 June 1877.\nIn the elections of 14 October 1877 after the dissolution of the House he was defeated in his attempt to be reelected in Louviers.\nHe tried again on 21 August 1881, but was again defeated.\n\nRaoul-Duval won in a by-election on 25 May 1884 in the Bernay district of Eure to replace Eugène Janvier de La Motte, who had died.\nOn 4 October 1885 he was elected on the conservative list of the Eure department.\nHe broke with the Bonapartists.\nIn mid-1886 he proposed to Lucien Millevoye that a broad conservative coalition should be formed that would include conservative republicans and Protestants.\nThe idea was discussed vaguely by the conservatives but did not have much effect.\nMost monarchists were not interested apart from a small clique of business-related northern deputies.\nIn 1886 Raoul-Duval was a member of the Central Committee of the newly founded French Association for the Propagation of Volapük.\nThe association was authorized on 8 April 1886 as a union of French enthusiasts of the Volapük constructed language.\n\nDue to poor health Raoul-Duval went to Monte Carlo in December 1886, where he died of a chill on 10 February 1887 at the age of 54.\nA bronze statue of Edgar Raoul-Duval was erected in 1890 in Notre-Dame-du-Vaudreuil, Eure.\n\nNumerous reports, proposals and speeches by Raoul-Duval were published.

{"id": "31069839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31069839", "title": "Gender identities in Thailand", "text": "Gender identities in Thailand\n\nIn Thailand, as elsewhere, one can find several different gender roles, identities and diverse visual markers of masculinity and femininity. The demand for positive self-identity is growing in Thailand and support is growing. Most of the identities oddly use English terms that are \"overloaded\" (reassigned meanings).\n\nA heterosexual male is the only sexuallity, which refers not just to physical sex but gender identity as well. Note this may differ from Western ideas of heterosexual male, to which \"lesbian sex\" has been eroticized. This means he seeks a traditional Thai female, but does not accept as a sexual or marriage partner the other female gender identities listed below.\n\nA heterosexual female refers to the traditional female who seeks the traditional heterosexual male (\"man\") in Thai society.\n\nThe Tom-Dee duality in Thailand maybe be compared to the butch-fem duality of lesbianism but differs in a number of ways. Among them are \"1-way\" and \"2-way\" subcategories in both, and in Toms physical presentation that may be compared to transgender men and a sense of role and duty of living up to strict stereotypes associated with gentleman.\n\nA \"tom\" (ทอม), from the English word \"tomboy\", is a female who dresses, acts, and possibly speaks in a masculine fashion. She may not identify as a lesbian, but she may be perceived as one by others. Toms wear short hair, a deviation from traditional Thai culture which prizes long hair as a sign of feminine beauty. Women usually wear skirts in Thailand, and in many government offices skirts are compulsory and pants suits banned. Toms dress in men's clothing—slacks, sandals, and loose fitting button-down shirts. According to Ara Wilson, a tom will use male speech terms, especially the old, now-crude pronouns \"goo\" (Thai: กู) and \"mueng\" (Thai: เม็ง / มึง).\n\nThe \"dee\" (ดี้), from the English word \"lady\", is a homosexual (or bisexual) female who follows outward Thai gender norms. A dee will look, act, and speak in a manner congruent with Thai female gender norms. The only difference between dees and traditional females is that dee often engage in relationships with toms. Some dees however, seek other dees.\n\nHeterosexual public displays of affection are frowned upon in Thai culture. However, minor displays of affection, such as hand-holding, between same sex individuals is considered the norm. In this way tom-dee partnerships can be invisible to the wider society.\n\nA Tom Gay is a Tom who is attracted to all 3 types of women, heterosexual women, Toms, and Dees.\n\nA lesbian in Thai culture differs from the West, i.e. a woman who is attracted to the traditional gender adhering Thai female.\n\nWithin the female community, there are roles which complicate identity. Particular among them are \"one-way\" and \"two-way\", which refer to the perceived permanent sexual roles of \"giver\" and \"receiver and giver\", respectively, but taking on a broader meaning than merely sex. A 1-way tom would see it fit to \"take care\" of the female both materially (pay for everything) and psychologically, but not accept the same in return. Conversely, the terms \"king\" and \"queen\" refer to active or receptive roles, yet can also be situational rather than an identity. The same terms \"king\" and \"queen\" are used for male homosexual roles. Toms may seek dees or toms (specialists referred to as\"Tom Gay King\"), toms may be 1-way or 2-way. Dees may seek toms or dees.\n\nAn \"Adam\" is a male who is attracted to Toms.\n\nAlthough the terms \"kathoey\" or \"ladyboy\" are rather ambiguous, simply put, both terms refer to someone assigned male at birth, who dresses as and adopts the mannerisms and identity of a woman. Though the term is often translated as \"transgender\", the term is rarely used in Thailand. Instead Thais use the term kathoey. This term can now also be used to refer to any male homosexual and was originally used to refer to intersex people. Due to this term becoming so broad, many choose to use the English word to explain a homosexual male dressing as a woman as a \"ladyboy\". The term can also be meant as an insult, especially to those who are trying to alter or openly express their identity, as it suggests that they are still men who are merely dressed as women. The term is used rather loosely at times and can be used to refer to any male who possesses traditionally 'feminine' qualities. Personally most of kathoeys prefer to call themselves \"a transformed goddess\" or \"a second type of woman\".\n\nKathoeys are numerous in Thailand and are seemingly accepted by society, not only in the cities but in the countryside as well. Thai Buddhism does not specifically regard homosexuality as a sin and has no specific prohibitions regarding the lifestyle. However, acceptance of kathoeys is still grudging in many corners of Thai society. Kathoey have not yet attained equal status with those who are not transgender, and restrictions come with the identity. Kathoey cannot officially change their birth sex on birth certificates or passports, meaning they cannot marry someone of the same sex (even if they identify with a different gender).\n\nThough kathoeys have experienced some prestige in the past, they still face many struggles in everyday life. Many have found success in the entertainment business or in fashion, while others dance cabaret or accept lower level work so that they are able to live their lives in the open. Beginning in the 1950s we are able to see a presence of kathoey and it can be traced in the media. The trend of kathoeys being a regular part of entertainment such as movies, music entertainment, and television shows is rather recent.\n\nA kathoey who is attracted to Toms.\n\nA \"cherry\" is a woman who likes gay men and kathoey.\n\nA \"Samyaan\" is a woman who likes all biological females regardless of gender identity.\n\nA male who likes all biological females, regardless of their gender identity.\n\n\n\n"}

The glyph is a superimposition of these two marks.\n\nA sentence ending with an interrobang asks a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement or disbelief in the form of a question, or asks a rhetorical question.\n\nFor example: \nWriters using informal language may use several alternating question marks and exclamation marks for even more emphasis, however this is regarded as poor style in formal writing.\nHistorically writers have used multiple punctuation marks to end a sentence expressing surprise and question.\n\n\"What the...?! Neves, Called Dead in Fall, Denies It\" (headline from \"San Francisco Examiner\", May 9, 1936)\nAmerican Martin K. Speckter (1915 – February 14, 1988) conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an advertising agency, Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if copywriters conveyed surprised rhetorical questions using a single mark. He proposed the concept of a single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine \"TYPEtalks\". Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included \"exclamaquest\", \"QuizDing\", \"rhet\", and \"exclarotive\", but he settled on \"interrobang\". He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it: \"interrogatio\" is Latin for \"rhetorical question\" or \"cross-examination\"; \"bang\" is printers' slang for the exclamation mark. Graphic treatments for the new mark were also submitted in response to the article.\n\nIn 1965, Richard Isbell created the Americana typeface for American Type Founders and included the interrobang as one of the characters. In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some Remington typewriters. In the 1970s, replacement interrobang keycaps and typefaces were available for some Smith-Corona typewriters.\nThe interrobang was in vogue for much of the 1960s; the word \"interrobang\" appeared in some dictionaries, and the mark was used in magazine and newspaper articles.\n\nMost fonts do not include the interrobang, but it has not disappeared: Lucida Grande, the default font for many UI elements of legacy versions of Apple's OS X operating system, includes the interrobang, and Microsoft provides several versions of the interrobang in the Wingdings 2 character set (on the right bracket and tilde keys on US keyboard layouts), included with Microsoft Office. It was accepted into Unicode and is included in several fonts, including Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial Unicode MS, and Calibri, the default font in the Office 2007, 2010, and 2013 suites.\n\nA reverse and upside down interrobang (combining ¿ and ¡, Unicode character: ⸘), suitable for starting phrases in Spanish, Galician and Asturian, which use inverted question and exclamation marks, is called an \"inverted interrobang\" or a \"gnaborretni\" (\"interrobang\" written backwards). In current practice, interrobang-like emphatic ambiguity in Hispanic languages is usually achieved by including both sets of punctuation marks one inside the other (\"¿¡De verdad!?\" or \"¡¿De verdad?!\" [\"Really!?\"]). Older usage, still official but not widespread, recommended mixing the punctuation marks: \"¡Verdad?\" or \"¿Verdad!\"\nThe interrobang is not a standard punctuation mark. Few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the interrobang character. The standard interrobang is at Unicode code point . The inverted interrobang is at Unicode code point . Single-character versions of the double-glyph versions are also available at code points and .\n\nThe interrobang can be used in some word processors with the alt code when working in a font that supports the interrobang, or using an operating system that performs font substitution.\n\nDepending on the browser and the fonts installed by the user, some of these may or may not be displayed or may be replaced with a character of a different font.\n\nOn a Linux system supporting the Compose key, an interrobang can be produced by pressing the compose key followed by the exclamation point and the question mark; reversing the order creates the inverted interrobang. On Mac OS X, it is found on the Character Palette, obtained by pressing the key combination .\n\nThe interrobang can be displayed in LaTeX by using the package textcomp and the command \\textinterrobang. The inverted interrobang is also provided for in the textcomp package through the command \\textinterrobangdown.\n\nThe State Library of New South Wales, in Australia, uses an interrobang as its logo, as does the educational publishing company Pearson, which intend it to convey \"the excitement and fun of learning\".\n\nChief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook used an interrobang in the 2012 Seventh Circuit opinion \"Robert F. Booth Trust v. Crowley\".\n\nAustralian Federal Court Justice Michael Wigney used an interrobang in the first paragraph of his 2018 judgment in Faruqi v Latham [2018] FCA 1328 (defamation proceedings between former Federal Opposition Leader, Mark Latham, and political campaigner and writer, Osman Faruqi).\n\nThere is an Italian thriller movie titled \"Interrabang\" (Italian for interrobang), which was released on December 31, 1969.\n\n\n"}

They are usually known as Kaplansky's conjectures.\n\nLet \"K\" be a field, and \"G\" a torsion-free group. Kaplansky's zero divisor conjecture states that the group ring \"K\"[\"G\"] does not contain nontrivial zero divisors, that is, it is a domain. Two related conjectures are:\n\n\nThe zero-divisor conjecture implies the idempotent conjecture and is implied by the unit conjecture. As of 2017 all three are open, though there are positive solutions for large classes of groups for both the idempotent and zero-divisor conjectures. For example the zero-divisor conjecture is known to hold for all virtually solvable groups and more generally also for all residually torsion-free solvable groups. These solutions go through establishing first the conclusion to the Atiyah conjecture on formula_1-Betti numbers, from which the zero-divisor conjecture easily follows. \n\nThe idempotent conjecture has a generalisation, the Kadison idempotent conjecture, also known as the Kadison–Kaplansky conjecture, for elements in the reduced group C*-algebra. In this setting it is known that if the Farrell–Jones conjecture holds for \"K\"[\"G\"] then so does the idempotent conjecture. The latter has been positively solved for an extremely large class of groups, including for example all hyperbolic groups. \n\nThe unit conjecture is also known to hold in many groups but its partial solutions are much less robust than the other two: for example there is a torsion-free 3-dimensional crystallographic group for which it is not known whether all units are trivial. This conjecture is not known to follow from any analytic statement as the other two, and so the cases where it is known to hold have all been established via a direct combinatorial approach involving the so-called unique products property.\n\nThis conjecture states that every algebra homomorphism from the Banach algebra \"C\"(\"X\") (continuous complex-valued functions on \"X\", where \"X\" is a compact Hausdorff space) into any other Banach algebra, is necessarily continuous. The conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every algebra norm on \"C\"(\"X\") is equivalent to the usual uniform norm. (Kaplansky himself had earlier shown that every \"complete\" algebra norm on \"C\"(\"X\") is equivalent to the uniform norm.)\n\nIn the mid-1970s, H. Garth Dales and J. Esterle independently proved that, \"if one furthermore assumes\" the validity of the continuum hypothesis, there exist compact Hausdorff spaces \"X\" and discontinuous homomorphisms from \"C\"(\"X\") to some Banach algebra, giving counterexamples to the conjecture.\n\nIn 1976, R. M. Solovay (building on work of H. Woodin) exhibited a model of ZFC (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory + axiom of choice) in which Kaplansky's conjecture is true. Kaplansky's conjecture is thus an example of a statement undecidable in ZFC.\n\n"}

It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO (\"laugh(ing) my ass off\") and ROFL (or its older form ROTFL; \"roll(ing) on the floor laughing\"). Other unrelated expansions include the now mostly obsolete \"lots of luck\" or \"lots of love\" used in letter-writing.\n\nThe list of acronyms \"grows by the month\", and they are collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication. These initialisms are controversial, and several authors recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" first listed LOL in March, 2011.\n\nLaccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Molski, in their essay entitled \"The Lost Art of Writing\", are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, \"Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not be 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms.\" Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that \"professional or business communication should never be careless or poorly constructed\" whether one is writing an electronic mail message or an article for publication, and warn against the use of smileys and abbreviations, stating that they are \"no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication\".\n\nLinguist John McWhorter stated, \"Lol is being used in a particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles…\" Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as \"oh\" in \"Oh, I don’t know\" and \"uh\" when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that \"lol\" is utilized less as a reaction to something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation.\n\nYunker and Barry in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are \"often misunderstood\" by students and are \"difficult to decipher\" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of \"ROFL\" as not obviously being the abbreviation of \"rolling on \"the\" floor laughing\" (emphasis added). Haig singles out LOL as one of the three most popular initialisms in Internet slang, alongside BFN (\"bye for now\") and IMHO (\"in my honest/humble opinion\"). He describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that \"as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing\". Bidgoli likewise states that these initialisms \"save keystrokes for the sender but [...] might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver\" and that \"[s]lang may hold different meanings and lead to misunderstandings especially in international settings\"; he advises that they be used \"only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning\".\n\nShortis observes that ROFL is a means of \"annotating text with stage directions\". Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between \"telling\" someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: \"The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor.\"\n\nDavid Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question \"How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?\". Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.\n\nVictoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that \"a user who types \"LOL\" may well be laughing louder than one who types \"lol\"\", and opines that \"these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse\". Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are in his view appropriate in such correspondence. June Hines Moore shares that view. So, too, does Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, \"or you won't be LOL\".\n\nOn March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for \"little old lady\" in the 1960s. They also discovered that the oldest written record of the use of LOL in the contemporary meaning of \"Laughing Out Loud\" was from a message typed by Wayne Pearson in the 1980s, from the archives of Usenet.\n\nGabriella Coleman references \"lulz\" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous.\n\nA 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually \"lower\" than she had expected. The students \"used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons\". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total; 76 were occurrences of \"LOL\".\n\n\"LOL\", \"ROFL\", and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal—likening the introduction of \"LOL\", \"ROFL\", and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century—states that this is \"a brand new variety of language evolving\", invented by young people within five years, that \"extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language\". However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as \"LOL\" and \"ROFL\" were to become very common in spoken English, their \"total effect on language\" would be \"utterly trivial\".\n\n\n\n\nIn some languages with a non-Latin script, the abbreviation LOL itself is also often transliterated. See for example Arabic لول and Russian лол.\n\nPre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is \"hi hi\". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling.\nMost of these variants are usually found in lowercase.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5496724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5496724", "title": "Language ideology", "text": "Language ideology\n\nLanguage ideology (also referred to as linguistic ideology) is a concept used primarily within the fields of anthropology (especially linguistic anthropology), sociolinguistics, and cross-cultural studies to characterize any set of beliefs or feelings about languages as used in their social worlds. When recognized and explored, language ideologies expose connections between the beliefs speakers have about language and the larger social and cultural systems they are a part of, illustrating how these beliefs are informed by and rooted in such systems. By doing so, language ideologies link the implicit as well as explicit assumptions people have about a language or language in general to their social experience and political as well as economic interests. Language ideologies are conceptualizations about languages, speakers, and discursive practices. Like other kinds of ideologies, language ideologies are influenced by political and moral interests and are shaped in a cultural setting. \n\nSeveral scholars have noted difficulty in attempting to delimit the scope, meaning, and applications of language ideology. Linguistic anthropologist Paul Kroskrity describes language ideology as a “cluster concept, consisting of a number of converging dimensions” with several “partially overlapping but analytically distinguishable layers of significance,” and cites that in the existing scholarship on language ideology “there is no particular unity . . . no core literature, and a range of definitions.” One of the broadest definitions is offered by Alan Rumsey, who describes language ideologies as “shared bodies of commonsense notions about the nature of language in the world.” This definition is seen by Kroskrity as unsatisfactory, however, because “it fails to problematize language ideological variation and therefore promotes an overly homogeneous view of language ideologies within a cultural group.” Emphasizing the role of speakers’ awareness in influencing language structure, Michael Silverstein defines linguistic ideologies as “sets of beliefs about language articulated by users as a rationalization or justification of perceived language structure and use.” Definitions that place greater emphasis on sociocultural factors include Shirley Heath’s characterization of language ideologies as “self-evident ideas and objectives a group holds concerning roles of language in the social experiences of members as they contribute to the expression of the group” and Judith Irvine’s definition of the concept as “the cultural system of ideas about social and linguistic relationships, together with their loading of moral and political interests.”\n\nThe basic division in studies of language ideology is between neutral and critical approaches to ideology. In neutral approaches to language ideology, speakers’ beliefs or ideas about language are understood as being shaped by the cultural systems in which they are embedded, but no attempt to identify variation within or across these systems is made. Often, a single ideology will be identified in such cases. Characterizations of language ideology as representative of an entire community or culture, such as those routinely documented in ethnographic research, are common examples of neutral approaches to language ideology.\n\nCritical approaches to language ideology explore the capacity for language and linguistic ideologies to be used as strategies for maintaining social power and domination. They are described by Kathryn Woolard and Bambi Schieffelin as studies of \"some aspects of representation and social cognition, with particular social origins or functional and formal characteristics.\" Although such studies are often noted for their discussions of language politics and the intersection between language and social class, the crucial difference between these approaches to language ideology and neutral understandings of the concept is that the former emphasize the existence of variability and contradiction both within and amongst ideologies, while the latter approach ideology as a conception on its own terms.\n\nMany scholars have argued that ideology plays a role in shaping and influencing linguistic structures and speech forms. Michael Silverstein, for example, sees speakers’ awareness of language and their rationalizations of its structure and use as critical factors that often shape the evolution of a language’s structure. According to Silverstein, the ideologies speakers possess regarding language mediate the variation that occurs due to their imperfect and limited awareness of linguistic structures, resulting in the regularization of any variation that is rationalized by any sufficiently dominant or culturally widespread ideologies. This is demonstrated by such linguistic changes as the rejection of “he” as the generic pronoun in English, which coincided with the rise of the feminist movement in the second half of the twentieth century . In this instance, the accepted usage of the masculine pronoun as the generic form came to be understood as a linguistic symbol of patriarchal and male-dominated society, and the growing sentiment opposing these conditions motivated some speakers to stop using “he” as the generic pronoun in favor of the construction “he or she.” This rejection of generic “he” was rationalized by the growing desire for gender equality and women’s empowerment, which was sufficiently culturally prevalent to regularize the change.\n\nAlan Rumsey also sees linguistic ideologies as playing a role in shaping the structure of a language, describing a circular process of reciprocal influence where a language’s structure conditions the ideologies that affect it, which in turn reinforce and expand this structure, altering the language “in the name of making it more like itself.” This process is exemplified by the excessive glottalization of consonants by bilingual speakers of moribund varieties of Xinca, who effectively altered the structure of this language in order to make it more distinct from Spanish. These speakers glottalized consonants in situations where more competent speakers of Xinca would not because they were not only less familiar with the phonological rules of the language, but because they wished to distinguish themselves from socially dominant Spanish, whose speakers viewed glottalized consonants as “exotic.”\n\nStudies of \"ways of speaking\" within specific communities have been recognized as especially productive sites of language ideological investigation. They often include a community’s own theory of speech as a part of their ethnography, which allows for the documentation of explicit language ideologies on a community-wide level or in “the neutral sense of cultural conceptions.” A study of language socialization practices in Dominica, for example, revealed that local notions of personhood, status, and authority are associated with the strategic usage of Patwa and English in the course of the adult-child interaction. The use of Patwa by children is largely forbidden by adults due to a perception that it inhibits the acquisition of English and thus restricts social mobility, which in turn has imbued Patwa with a significant measure of covert prestige and rendered it a powerful tool for children to utilize in order to defy authority. Thus there are multiple, competing ideologies of Patwa in Dominica: one which encourages a shift away from Patwa usage; and another which contributes to its maintenance.\n\nJ. L. Austin and John Searle's speech act theory has been described by several ethnographers, anthropologists, and linguists as being based in a specifically Western linguistic ideology that renders it inapplicable in certain ethnographic contexts. Jef Verschueren characterized speech act theory as privileging “a privatized view of language that emphasizes the psychological state of the speaker while downplaying the social consequences of speech,” while Michael Silverstein argued that the theory’s ideas about language “acts” and “forces” are “projections of covert categories typical in the metapragmatic discourse of languages such as English.” Scholars have subsequently used speech act theory to caution against the positioning of linguistic theories as universal applicable, citing that any account of language will reflect the linguistic ideologies held by those who develop it.\n\nSeveral scholars have noted that sites of cultural contact promote the development of new linguistic forms that draw on diverse language varieties and ideologies at an accelerated rate. According to Miki Makihara and Bambi Schieffelin, it becomes necessary during times of cultural contact for speakers to actively negotiate language ideologies and to consciously reflect on language use. This articulation of ideology is essential to prevent misconceptions of meaning and intentions between cultures, and provides a link between sociocultural and linguistic processes in contact situations.\n\nThe establishment of a standard language has many implications in the realms of politics and power. Recent examinations of language ideologies have resulted in the conception of “standard” as a matter of ideology rather than fact, raising questions such as “how doctrines of linguistic correctness and incorrectness are rationalized and how they are related to doctrines of the inherent representational power, beauty, and expressiveness of language as a valued mode of action.”.\n\nGovernmental policies often reflect the tension between two contrasting types of language ideologies: ideologies that conceive of language as a resource, problem, or right and ideologies that conceive of language as pluralistic phenomena. The language-related policies that emerge in such instances often reflect the compromise that is reached between these two types of ideologies. According to Blommaert and Verschueren, this compromise is often reinterpreted as a single, unified ideology, evidenced by the many European societies characterized by a language ideological \"homogenism.\"\n\nPurist language ideologies or ideologies of linguistic conservatism can close off languages to nonnative sources of innovation, usually when such sources are perceived as socially or politically threatening to the target language. Among the Tewa, for example, the influence of theocratic institutions and ritualized linguistic forms in other domains of Tewa society have led to a strong resistance to the extensive borrowing and shift many of its neighboring language communities have experienced. According to Paul Kroskrity this is due to a \"dominant language ideology\" through which ceremonial Kiva speech is elevated to a linguistic ideal and the cultural preferences that it embodies, namely regulation by convention, indigenous purism, strict compartmentalization, and linguistic indexing of identity, are recursively projected onto the Tewa language as a whole.\n\nAlexandra Jaffe points out that language purism is often part of “essentializing discourses” that can lead to stigmatizing habitual language practices like code-switching and depict contact-induced linguistic changes as forms of cultural deficiency.\n\nAs defined by Rosina Lippi-Green, standard language ideology is \"a bias toward an abstract, idealized homogeneous language, which is imposed and maintained by dominant institutions and which has as its model the written language, but which is drawn primarily from the spoken language of the upper middle class.\" According to Lippi-Green, part of this ideology is a belief that standard languages are internally consistent. Linguists generally agree, however, that variation is intrinsic to all spoken language, including standard varieties.\n\nStandard language ideology is strongly connected with the concepts of linguistic purism and prescriptivism. It is also linked with linguicism (linguistic discrimination).\n\nLiteracy cannot be strictly defined technically, but is rather a set of practices determined by the language ideology of a community. It can be interpreted in a multitude of ways that are determined by political, social, and economic forces. According to Kathryn Woolard and Bambi Schieffelin, literacy traditions are closely linked to social control in most societies. The typical European literacy ideology, for example, recognizes literacy solely in an alphabetic capacity.\n\nIn the 1960s, missionaries arrived in Papua New Guinea and exposed the Kaluli to Christianity and modernization, part of which was accomplished through the introduction of literacy. The Kaluli primers that were introduced by the missionaries promoted Westernization, which effectively served to strip the vernacular language of cultural practices and from discourse in church and school. Readers written in the 1970s used derogatory terms to refer to the Kaluli and depicted their practices as inferior, motivating the Kaluli to change their self-perceptions and orient themselves towards Western values. The missionaries’ control of these authoritative books and of this new “technology of language literacy” gave them the power to effect culture change and morph the ideology of Kaluli into that of modern Christianity.\n\nOrthographic systems always carry historical, cultural, and political meaning that are grounded in ideology. Orthographic debates are focused on political and social issues rather than on linguistic discrepancies, which can make for intense debates characterized by ideologically charged stances and symbolically important decisions.\n\n\"Language ideologies are not confined merely to ideas or beliefs, but rather is extended to include the very language practices through which our ideas or notions are enacted\" (Razfar, 2005). Teachers display their language ideologies in classroom instruction through various practices such as correction or repair, affective alignment, metadiscourse, and narrative (see Razfar & Rumenapp, 2013, p. 289). The study of ideology seeks to uncover the hidden world of students and teachers to shed light on the fundamental forces that shape and give meaning to their actions and interactions.\n\n"}
{"id": "14612246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14612246", "title": "Languages of Fiji", "text": "Languages of Fiji\n\nFiji has three official languages under the 1997 constitution (and not revoked by the 2013 Constitution): English, Fijian and Hindi. Fijian is spoken either as a first or second language by most indigenous Fijians who make up around 54% of the population. \n\nFijians of Indian descent make up a further 37%, mainly speaking a local variant of Hindi, known as \"Fiji Hindi\". English, a remnant of British colonial rule over the islands, was the sole official language until 1997 and is widely used in government, business, and education as a lingua franca. Considerable business is also done in Fijian, especially away from larger town centre.\n\nA small number of other indigenous East Fijian and West Fijian regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. Rotuman and Chinese are also spoken by immigrant populations.\n\nUntil the 19th century, Fiji's population consisted almost entirely of indigenous Fijians, who were of mixed Polynesian and Melanesian descent and generally spoke languages of the Malayo-Polynesian language family. After the islands came under British colonial rule, a number of contract workers were brought from present-day British India, spreading the use of the Hindi language. \n\nAll three of Fiji's official languages have greatly been influenced by one another, in terms of vocabulary and, in some cases, grammar because of the constant, everyday contact between these languages, now for over a century. Fiji's diverse, multiracial and multilingual makeup make these languages, as well as other unofficial, minority languages in Fiji (such as Western Fijian, Chinese, Banaban, Rotuman, Tuvaluan and other present Indian languages), influence one another.\n\nEnglish usage in Fiji predates the cession of Fiji to Great Britain by a few decades. English was first encountered from the first explorers and traders and found greater popularity as a lingua franca (albeit mixed with English in an early and now extinct Pidgin Fijian) between frontier settlers and the indigenous peoples. By the time of the British administration, much of the Fijian nobility were able to comprehend basic English. The English spoken in Fiji today is very different and has developed significantly over the close to 150 years of usage in the islands.\n\nLike many former colonies of Great Britain, there are certain 'situational varieties' of English present. There is the very formal, 'Proper' English (which would resemble formal English in Australia or the United Kingdom) as it is known, which is to be used in government and any other situation deemed formal enough for its use, but it has fallen out of favor due to the popularity of the more laid back varieties and is still spoken only by the older generation that lived through the colonial days. A sort of mid-level English is used in school, church, work and in semi-formal situations and is basically English with localized grammatical innovations and words imported from Hindi and Fijian; it is quickly becoming 'formal English' in Fiji. \n\nVery informal Fiji English, or Finglish, is used among all races with family, friends and in general conversations and in any other situation not deemed formal. Fiji English has been tentatively studied by linguists and has been suggested as a separate dialect from Standard English (as has developed in Australia and New Zealand) but the distinction is not made locally or in the constitution. Moreover, other linguists suggest it is part of a greater South Pacific English dialect because of the shared development of English within former British colonies and protectorates in the South Pacific.\n\nFijian is an Austronesian language of the Malayo-Polynesian family spoken in Fiji. It has 300,000 first-language speakers, which is more than half the population of Fiji, but another 300,000 speak it as a second language. The early missionaries selected the Bau dialect or Bauan (which, among the East Fijian dialects, held the place that French would in Europe, while the purer Rewa dialect would be Latin) as the standard dialect for printing and communicating. Bauan soon became the standard of communication among the indigenous iTaukei. Bauan was selected not only because of its prestige but also because it was the language of the then politically dominant island of Bau and the Mataiwelagi chiefs (and claimed King of Fiji).\n\nBy the middle to the late 19th century, with the push by missionaries, Bauan had also invaded the Western areas of Viti Levu, which spoke an entirely different set of dialects belonging to the West Fijian language, which is grouped with Polynesian and Rotuman in the West Fijian-Polynesian language family and practiced a different culture. This occurred up to the point that many Bauan words entered many western Fijian languages. Bauan was then adopted by the British administration for communication with the iTaukei. Over time, it evolved into what is today Standard Fijian which includes many English and Other Fijian Dialectal contributions, becoming quite distinct from the original Bauan Dialect.\n\nHindi is an official language in Fiji. In the 1997 Constitution, it was referred to as \"Hindustani\", but in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called \"Hindi\".\n\nFiji Hindi, also known as Fijian Baat or Fijian Hindustani, is the language spoken by most Fijian citizens of Indian descent. It is derived mainly from the Awadhi and Bhojpuri varieties of Hindi. It has also borrowed a large number of words from Fijian and English. The relation between Fiji Hindi and Standard Hindi is similar to the relation between Afrikaans and Dutch. Indian indentured labourers were initially brought to Fiji mainly from districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, North-West Frontier and South India such as from Andhra and Tamil Nadu. They spoke numerous, mainly Hindi, dialects and languages depending on their district of origin.\n\nA language soon developed in Fiji that combined the common elements of the Hindi dialects spoken in these areas with Fijian, Arabic, and English words; this has diverged significantly from the varieties of Hindi spoken on the Indian sub-continent. The development of Fiji Hindi was accelerated by the need for labourers speaking different dialects and sub-dialects of Hindi to work together and the practice of young children being left during working hours in early versions of day care centers. \n\nLater, approximately 15,000 Indian indentured labourers, who were mainly speakers of Dravidian languages (Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam), were brought from South India. By this time Fiji Hindi was well established as the lingua franca of Fiji Indians and the South Indian labourers had to learn it to communicate with the more numerous North Indians and European overseers. Inward migration of free Gujarati and Punjabi settlers further contributed to Fiji Hindi.\n\nFiji is also home to many smaller minorities which make up its multicultural and multilingual populace.\n\nRotuman, also referred to as Rotunan, Rutuman or Fäeag Rotuma, is an Austronesian language spoken by the indigenous people of the South Pacific island group of Rotuma, an island with a Polynesian-influenced culture that was incorporated as a dependency into the Colony of Fiji in 1881 and later chose to remain with Fiji in 1970 upon independence and in 1987, when Fiji became a republic. The rotuman language is spoken by more than 2000 people on the island of Rotuma and a further 10,000 people who live or work in the Republic of Fiji.\n\nOther Indian languages are spoken in Fiji. After the indenture system, Indians who spoke Gujarati and Punjabi arrived in Fiji as free immigrants. At present, many free settler descendants in Fiji and their families speak Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi and Gujarati at home, but all speak and communicate with each other in English. \n\nTwo significant languages that are seeing growth are Cantonese Chinese and Mandarin Chinese. Many Chinese settlers, especially from southern China speak Cantonese, which is quickly incorporating many Fijian and English words. Many of these migrants are farmers and are constantly exposed to the Fijian and Hindi dominated areas of rural Fiji.\n\nFurthermore, sizeable minorities of Micronesians and Polynesians mean that Fiji is also home to various Micronesian and Polynesian languages. Significant among them are the Banaban, which is the language of the former residents of Ocean Island, which was decimated through British phosphate mining. They were given Rabi Island in North-Eastern Fiji as a new homeland and number 2000-3000. Also, Kioa, which was given to former Tuvaluans, who migrated as the consequence of overcrowding on Vaitupu. They speak Tuvaluan, a Polynesian language and number around a thousand. Also, there are many Tongan residents and Fijians of Tongan descent in Fiji. These groups speak the Tongan language or a mix of Tongan and Fijian.\n\n"}
{"id": "185220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185220", "title": "Livius Andronicus", "text": "Livius Andronicus\n\nLucius Livius Andronicus (; c. 284 – c. 205 BC) was a Greco-Roman dramatist and epic poet of the Old Latin period. He began as an educator in the service of a noble family at Rome by translating Greek works into Latin, including Homer's \"Odyssey\". They were meant at first as educational devices in the school he founded. He wrote works for the stage—both tragedies and comedies—which are regarded as the first dramatic works written in the Latin language of ancient Rome. His comedies were based on Greek New Comedy and featured characters in Greek costume. Thus, the Romans referred to this new genre by the term comoedia palliata (fabula palliata). The Roman biographer Suetonius later coined the term \"half-Greek\" of Livius and Ennius (referring to their genre, not their ethnic backgrounds). The genre was imitated by the next dramatists to follow in Andronicus' footsteps and on that account he is regarded as the father of Roman drama and of Latin literature in general; that is, he was the first man of letters to write in Latin. Varro, Cicero, and Horace, all men of letters during the subsequent Classical Latin period, considered Livius Andronicus to have been the originator of Latin literature. He is the earliest Roman poet whose name is known.\n\nIn ancient sources, Livius Andronicus is either given that name or is simply called Livius. Andronicus is the Latinization of a Greek name, which was held by a number of Greek historical figures of the period. It is generally considered that Andronicus came from his Greek name and that Livius, a name originally local to Latium, was the gentilicium, the family name, of his patron (\"patronus\"). His career at Rome was launched from servitude and he became a freedman (\"libertus\") by the grace of his master, one of the \"Livia gens\". The praenomen Lucius is given by Aulus Gellius and Cassiodorus.\n\nLivius' dates are based mainly on Cicero and Livy. Cicero says, \"This Livius exhibited his first performance at Rome in the Consulship of M. Tuditanus, and C. Clodius the son of Caecus, the year before Ennius was born,\" that is, in 240 BC. Cicero goes on to relate the point of view of Accius, that Livius was captured from Tarentum in 209, and produced a play in 197. Cicero disagrees with this view on the grounds that it would make Livius younger than Plautus and Naevius, though he was supposed to have been the first to produce a play. Livy says, \"The pontiffs also decreed that three bands of maidens, each consisting of nine, should go through the city singing a hymn. This hymn [the \"parthenion\") was composed by the poet, Livius.\" This action was taken to expiate the gods after a series of evil portents in the consulship of \"C. Claudius Nero for the first time, M. Livius for the second;\" that is, in 207. Only the dates of 240 and 207 seem exempt from controversy.\n\nJerome has some additional detail that tends to support the capture at Tarentum and enslavement. His entry for the year of Abraham 1829, the second year of the 148th Olympiad (186/185 BC), of his \"Chronicon\", reads\"Titus Livius tragoediarum scriptor clarus habetur, qui ob ingenii meritum a Livio Salinatore, cuius liberos erudiebat, libertate donatus est.\"\n\nTitus Livius, author of tragedies, is held to be outstanding. He was given liberty by Livius Salinator, whose children he was educating, by merit of his intelligence.\n\nJerome is the only author to name him Titus. The passage is ambiguous concerning the events actually happening in Olympiad 148; Andronicus could have been being given liberty or simply have been being honoured, having been liberated long ago. Livius Salinator might be Gaius Livius Salinator, his father Marcus Livius Salinator, or his grandfather Marcus. If Jerome means that the liberation took place in 186, then he seems to be following Accius' view, which might have been presented in the missing portions of Suetonius' \"de Poetis\" and read by Jerome. The passage is not conclusive about anything. However, the mixed name of Livius and his being associated with Salinator suggests that he was captured at the first fall of Tarentum in 272, sold to the first Marcus Livius Salinator, tutored the second and was set free to have an independent career when the task was complete.\n\nLivius made a translation of the \"Odyssey\", entitled the \"Odusia\" in Latin, for his classes in Saturnian verse. All that survives is parts of 46 scattered lines from 17 books of the Greek 24-book epic. In some lines, he translates literally, though in others more freely. His translation of the \"Odyssey\" had a great historical importance. Before then, the Mesopotamians and Egyptians had translated judicial and religious texts, but no one had yet translated a literary work written in a foreign language until Livius. Livius' translation made this fundamental Greek text accessible to Romans, and advanced literary culture in Latin. This project was one of the first examples of translation as an artistic process; the work was to be enjoyed on its own, and Livius strove to preserve the artistic quality of the original. Since there was no tradition of epic in Italy before him, Livius must have faced enormous problems. For example, he used archaising forms to make his language more solemn and intense. His innovations would be important in the history of Latin poetry.\n\nIn the fragments we have, it is clear that Livius had a desire to remain faithful to the original and to be clear, while having to alter untranslatable phrases and ideas. For example, the phrase \"equal to the gods\", which would have been unacceptable to Romans, was changed to \"summus adprimus\", \"greatest and of first rank\". Also, early Roman poetry made use of pathos, expressive force, and dramatic tension, so Livius interprets Homer with a mind to these ideas as well. In general, Livius did not make arbitrary changes to the text; rather, he attempted to remain faithful to Homer and to the Latin language.\n\nLivius' first play, according to Cicero, was staged in 240. Livy tells us that Livius was the first to create a play with a plot. One story says that after straining his voice, Livius, who was also an actor, was the first to leave the singing to singers and limited the actors to dialogue.\n\nHis dramatic works were written in the iambic senarius and trochaic septenarius. They included both lyric passages (\"cantica\") and dialogue (\"diverbia\"). His dramatic works had large element of solos for chief actor, often himself. It is not known whether he had a chorus. These dramatic works of Livius Andronicus were consistent with Greek requirements of drama and probably had Greek models, and we have no more than 60 fragments, as quoted in other authors.\n\nThe titles of his known tragedies are \"Achilles\", \"Aegisthus\", \"Aiax Mastigophorus\" (\"Ajax with the Whip\"), \"Andromeda\", \"Antiopa\", \"Danae\", \"Equus Troianus\", \"Hermiona\", and \"Tereus\".\n\nTwo titles of his comedies are certain, \"Gladiolus\" and \"Ludius\", though the third, \"Virgo\", is probably corrupt. They were all composed on the model of Greek New Comedy, adapting stories from the Greek. The Romans called this sort of adaptation of comedy by Livius and his immediate successors \"fabulae palliatae\", or \"comoedia palliata\", named from the \"pallium\", or short cloak, worn by the actors. Of Andronicus' \"palliata\" we have 6 fragments of 1 verse each and 1 title, \"Gladiolus\", (\"Little Saber\").\n\nAccording to Livy, Livius also composed a hymn for a chorus of 27 girls in honour of Juno to be performed in public as part of religious ceremonies in 207. Because of the success of this hymn, Livius received public honours when his professional organization, the \"collegium scribarum histrionumque\" was installed in the Temple of Minerva on the Aventine. Actors and writers would gather here and offer gifts.\n\n\n"}

NooJ allows linguists to construct the four classes of the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy of generative grammars: Finite-State Grammars, Context-Free Grammars, Context-Sensitive Grammars as well as Unrestricted Grammars, using either a text editor (e.g. to write down regular expressions), or a Graph editor.\n\nNooJ allows linguists to develop orthographical and morphological grammars, dictionaries of simple words, of compound words as well as discontinuous expressions, local syntactic grammars (such as Named Entities Recognizers), structural syntactic grammars (that produce syntactic trees) as well as Zellig Harris‘ transformational grammars. \n\nAll NooJ parsers process Atomic Linguistic Units (ALUs), as opposed to word forms (i.e. sequences of letters between two space characters). This allows NooJ’s syntactic parser to parse sequences of word forms such as “can not” exactly as contracted word forms such as “cannot” or “can’t”. This allows linguists to write relatively simple syntactic grammars, even for agglutinative languages. ALUs are represented by annotations that are stored in the Text Annotation Structure (or TAS): all NooJ parsers add, or remove annotations in the TAS. A typical NooJ analysis involves applying to a text a series of elementary grammars in cascade, in a bottom-up approach (from spelling to semantics).\n\nNooJ originated in investigations by Silberztein and the INTEX community of linguist users into the Lexicon-Grammar approach of Maurice Gross’ LADL, which states that no grammar rule can be developed independently from a strict delimitation of its domain of application.\n\nNooJ has been used as a corpus processor by researchers in Linguistics, History, in Psychology, in Literature studies, in sentiment analysis projects, data mining, and even for processing musical notes. For instance NooJ was used in the MARS 500 experiment but also by several computer software companies to build Information Extraction and Information Retrieval software.\n\nNooJ’s dictionaries are represented by finite-state transducers and can represent simple words (e.g. table), compound words (e.g. as a matter of fact) as well as dicontinuous expressions such as phrasal verbs (e.g. to turn … off), idiomatic expressions (e.g. to take the bull by the horns) as well as support verb/predicative noun associations (e.g. to take a nap).\nNooJ allows linguists to create, edit, debug and maintain a large number of grammars that belong to the four classes of generative grammars in the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy: finite-state grammars, context-free grammars, context-sensitive grammars and unrestricted grammars.\n\nNooJ can often apply grammars to texts in linear time: for instance, most NooJ Context-Free Grammars can often be derecursived. NooJ Context-Sensitive Grammars are made of two parts: one part is a Context-Free (or even a Finite-State Grammar) that is applied to texts very efficiently, the second consists in a set of constraints applied to matching sequences, each one performed in constant time.\nNooJ unrestricted grammars are context-sensitive grammars that can contain variables and can modify the text input. They are typically used to perform transformational analysis & generation (see Zellig Harris), but several teams of linguists have shown that, when used in conjunction with multilingual lexicons, they can be used to perform Machine Translation\n\n"}

It is regarded as the dominant Malay dialect spoken along the vast riverine systems of Pahang, but co-exists with other Malay dialects traditionally spoken in the state. Along the coastline of Pahang, Terengganu Malay is spoken in a narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns. Another dialect spoken in Tioman island is a distinct Malay variant and most closely related to Riau Archipelago Malay subdialect spoken in Natuna and Anambas islands in the South China Sea, together forming a dialect continuum between the Bornean Malay with the Mainland Peninsular/Sumatran Malay.\n\nNonetheless, the essential unity of Pahang and Terengganu Malay is demonstrated by the number of shared lexical, synctatic, and phonetics innovations. Both varieties along with Kelantan Malay, have been classified under the subgroup of the East Coast dialect of Malay peninsula, due to their possible common origin.\n\nPahang Malay is known for its sharp rise and fall of tone and quick flowing accent. It exhibits a number of differences from the Standard Malay, particularly in phonology and vocabulary. Even though it also shares a lot of similarities with standard Malay, the dialect in its purest form remains unintelligible to standard Malay speakers. There are a number of sub-dialects of Pahang Malay identified by linguists, but the form spoken in the vicinity of Pahang's royal capital, Pekan, is considered as its 'standard sub-dialect'.\n\nThe dialect is traditionally written in Jawi script, but its role as the main writing language has been replaced with Standard Malay written in Rumi. A local radio station, Pahang FM, broadcasts in this dialect.\n\nPahang Malay is natively referred to as \"base Pahang\" (; Standard Malay: \"bahasa Pahang\", بهاس ڤهڠ), or \"cakak Pahang\" (; Standard Malay: \"cakap Pahang\", چاكڤ ڤهڠ). However, in academic writings, it is alternatively known as \"bahasa Melayu Pahang\" or \"dialek Pahang\". The term Pahang itself originated from the name of the state which in turn derived from the name of Pahang River, where the early civilisation in the state could have developed from. There have been many theories on the origin of the name Pahang. A local lore mentioned that it is derived from the corruption of the name \"\" tree (Macaranga). On the other hand, William Linehan relates the early foundation of the state to the settlers from ancient Khmer civilisation, and claims its naming origin to the word \"saamnbahang\" (Khmer: សំណប៉ាហាំង) meaning 'tin', which abundantly found in the state. The earliest literary reference to the name 'Pahang' was from the chronicle of Liu Song dynasty, \"Book of Song\", that records about two consecutive envoys received from the kingdom of 'Pohuang' (alternatively 'Panhuang') between 449 and 457 CE.\n\nThere are at least two theories on the origin of Pahang Malay. Asmah Omar identifies the settlements near the estuary of Pahang River and its adjacent areas, where the early civilisation of Pahang could have begun, as the place of origin of the dialect before it was diffused inland. This area includes Pekan, the historical capital of Pahang, which the subdialect of Pahang Malay spoken in the area is named after. This theory is consistent to the known details of Malay settlement patterns in Southeast Asia. Until the 19th century, the Malay population was riverine and maintaining inter-communal link by river and maritime routes.\n\nAnother theory by Tarmizi Harsah, suggests that the dialect originated from Ulu Tembeling, in deep hinterland of Pahang. The theory is based on the study of a variant spoken in Ulu Tembeling, also known locally as \"cakap ulu\" (\"the upstream speech\") or \"base lama\" (\"the old language\"). Although it retains part of the general characteristics of Pahang Malay, the dialect of Ulu Tembeling has the special feature of consonantal diphthongisation at the end of words, which is one of its kind among Malay dialects of the peninsula. Another unique feature of the dialect is that it retains several phonological characteristics of Ancient Malay language, for example the use of vowel *i and *u, and the addition of glottal consonant at the last position in words ending with vowels. However, Tarmizi's theory went against the commonly accepted Malay settlement patterns which began at river mouth and coastal areas before dispersing inland.\n\nPahang Malay is almost exclusively spoken within the state of Pahang, though there are sizeable migrant communities of its native speakers in urban areas like Klang Valley, and other states of the peninsula. Nevertheless, within the state of Pahang, there are at least two other distinct Malay varieties traditionally spoken. Coastal Terengganu Malay, a relative variant with shared lexical, synctatic, and phonetics innovations, is spoken in narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns along the coastline of Pahang. This complicated spatial layering of different Malay variants, often within a few kilometres radius between hamlets of Pahang Malay speakers along the riverine systems and the Terengganu-speaking coastal fishermen villages, is influenced by the historical movement of Terengganu Malays to that area. For centuries, the coastal line stretching from Terengganu border to the Endau of Johor, was the heaven for temporary settlements of fishermen from Terengganu and Kelantan who came there during fishing season. Over the time, a well established communities began to develop in areas like Beserah, Kuala Pahang, and Kuala Rompin. Another dialect not related to Pahang Malay, is spoken in Tioman island of Pahang and Aur Islands of Johor, and most closely related only to Sarawak Malay, spoken across the South China Sea in northwest Borneo. Despite the existence these foreign and isolated Malay variants, Pahang Malay remains as the de facto official dialect of the state, predominantly spoken along the lining of its vast riverine systems.\n\nDue to high divergences of the sub-dialects of Pahang Malay, their classifications remain unclear so far. Among the earliest attempt to classify these sub-dialects was by Asmah Omar who conducted her study based on the \"daerah\" (district). She enlisted 8 sub-dialects of Pahang Malay, namely the dialects of Pekan, Benta, Raub, Ulu Tembeling, Rompin, Temerloh, Kuala Lipis and Bentong. She also named the sub-dialect spoken in the vicinity of Pekan, including the state capital, Kuantan, as the 'standard sub-dialect' and the major source for other sub-dialects spoken inland. Her view is based on the prestige of Pekan and Kuantan as the main economic, cultural and administration centres of the state.\n\nOther scholars like Collins and Tarmizi Harsah provided an alternative method in this dialectal study, focusing on the geographic units of river basins and coastal strips, rather than on the existing political boundaries. This is based on the fact that the spread of these sub-dialects is independent of the political divisions of current Malaysian states. On the other hand, both river basins and coastal strips are the features of topography that have greatly shaped the earliest patterns of migration and settlement in the Malay world of Southeast Asia. Based on this, Tarmizi Harsah identified three main variants of Pahang Malay, spoken along the lining of three main rivers of Pahang; Pahang River, Jelai River and Lipis River. He classified these variants further into two main sub-dialects; \"Hulu Pahang\" ('Upper Pahang') consisting Lipis and Jelai rivers variants, and \"Hilir Pahang\" ('Lower Pahang') consisting Pahang River variant.\n\nIn general, like many other dialects of Malay language, the differences between Pahang Malay and the Standard Malay are recognized through changes in phonology at the end of the words. The unique identity of Pahang Malay can be traced in three features of phonology; vowels before consonant [± coronal], alveolar trill and diphthongs and . The contrast between coronals and non-coronals is among the first feature recognised by Collins (1983, 1998) and Ajid Che Kob & Mohd Tarmizi (2009). Although this feature is shared among all sub-dialects of Pahang, there are still different vowel realisation patterns found among those variants. These varied patterns are demonstrated in the following tables.\n\nThe Standard Malay alveolar trill , at the end of words, is usually omitted in most Malay dialects. But the omitted sound will always be replaced with certain phonetic forms, either through the elongation of consonant or de-articulation of \"schwa\". Both forms exist in Pahang Malay and described by linguists as 'very obvious'. Elongation of consonant can be seen in the use of , and in sub-dialect spoken along the Jelai River, while de-articulation of schwa is shown by sub-dialects spoken along the Pahang and Lipis rivers that utilise , and .\nCommon diphthongs found in Standard Malay, and are not exist in Pahang Malay, as both are monophthongised instead. This does not means that there are no diphthongs in the dialect at all. Pahang Malay acquired its diphthongs through the diphthongisation of monophthongs, for example vowel sounds and are diphthongised into and . This phenomenon is considered common among many Malay dialects. The following table shows some monophthong realisation for diphthongs and in Pahang Malay.\n\nThe following are some differences in vocabulary between Pahang Malay and Standard Malay.\n\n"}

{"id": "59412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59412", "title": "Syriac language", "text": "Syriac language\n\nSyriac (; '), also known as Assyrian, Syriac/Syrian Aramaic or Classical Syriac,<ref name=\"ISO 639-2/RA\"></ref><ref name=\"ISO 639-3/RA\"></ref> is a dialect of Middle Aramaic. Having first appeared in the early first century CE in Edessa, classical Syriac became a major literary language throughout the Middle East from the 4th to the 8th centuries, preserved in a large body of Syriac literature. Indeed, Syriac literature comprises roughly 90% of the extant Aramaic literature. Syriac was once spoken across much of the Near East as well as Anatolia and Eastern Arabia.\n\nThe Old Aramaic language was adopted by the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–609 BC) when the Assyrians conquered the various Syro-Hittite states to its west. The Achaemenid Empire (546-332 BC), which rose after the fall of the Assyrian Empire, also retained Old Aramaic as its official language, and Old Aramaic remained the lingua franca of the region. During the course of the third and fourth centuries AD, the inhabitants of the region began to embrace Christianity.\n\nAlong with Latin and Greek, Syriac became one of \"the three most important Christian languages in the early centuries\" of the Common Era. From the 1st century AD, Syriac became the vehicle of Syriac Christianity and culture, and the liturgical language of the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Maronite Church, and the Church of the East, along with its descendants: the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, and the Assyrian Pentecostal Church.\n\nSyriac Christianity and language spread throughout Asia as far as the Indian Malabar Coast and Eastern China, and was the medium of communication and cultural dissemination for the later Arabs and, to a lesser extent, the Parthian Empire and Sasanian Empire. Primarily a Christian medium of expression, Syriac had a fundamental cultural and literary influence on the development of Arabic, which largely replaced it towards the 14th century. Syriac remains the sacred language of Syriac Christianity to this day.\n\nSyriac is a Middle Aramaic language and, as such, a language of the Northwest Semitic languages of the Afroasiatic family. It is written in the Syriac alphabet, a derivation of the Aramaic alphabet.\n\nSyriac was the local accent of Aramaic in Edessa, and evolved under the influence of the Church of the East and the Syriac Orthodox Church into its current form. Before Arabic became the dominant language, Syriac was a major language among Christian communities in the Middle East, Central Asia and Kerala, and remains so among the Syriac Christians to this day. It has been found as far afield as Hadrian's Wall in Great Britain, with inscriptions written by Assyrian and Aramean soldiers of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe history of Syriac can be divided into three distinct periods:\n\nThe name \"Syriac\", when used with no qualification, generally refers to one specific dialect of Middle Aramaic but not to Old Aramaic or to the various present-day Eastern and Central Neo-Aramaic languages descended from it or from close relatives. The modern varieties are, therefore, not discussed in this article.\n\nIn 132 BC, the kingdom of Osroene was founded in Edessa and Proto-Syriac evolved in that kingdom. Many Syriac-speakers still look to Edessa as the cradle of their language.\nThere are about eighty extant early Syriac inscriptions, dated to the first three centuries AD (the earliest example of Syriac, rather than Imperial Aramaic, is in an inscription dated to AD 6, and the earliest parchment is a deed of sale dated to AD 243). All of these early examples of the language are non-Christian. As an official language, Syriac was given a relatively coherent form, style and grammar that is lacking in other Old Eastern Aramaic dialects. The Syriac language split into a western variety used by the Syriac Orthodox Churches in upper Mesopotamia and western Syria, and an eastern dialect used in the Sasanian Empire controlled east used by the Church of the East.\n\nIn the 3rd century, churches in Edessa began to use Syriac as the language of worship. There is evidence that the adoption of Syriac, the language of the Assyrian people, was to effect mission. Much literary effort was put into the production of an authoritative translation of the Bible into Syriac, the Peshitta ( ). At the same time, Ephrem the Syrian was producing the most treasured collection of poetry and theology in the Syriac language.\n\nIn 489, many Syriac-speaking Christians living in the eastern reaches of the Roman Empire fled to the Sasanian Empire to escape persecution and growing animosity with Greek-speaking Christians. The Christological differences with the Church of the East led to the bitter Nestorian Schism in the Syriac-speaking world. As a result, Syriac developed distinctive western and eastern varieties. Although remaining a single language with a high level of comprehension between the varieties, the two employ distinctive variations in pronunciation and writing system, and, to a lesser degree, in vocabulary.\n\nWestern Syriac is the official language of the West Syriac Rite, practised by the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Maronite Catholic Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Malabar Independent Syrian Church, the Mar Thoma Syrian Church and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church.\n\nEastern Syriac is the liturgical language of the East Syriac Rite, practised in modern times by the ethnic Assyrian followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, the Assyrian Pentecostal Church, the Ancient Church of the East, the Assyrian-Chaldean Catholic Church, as well as the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church in India.\n\nSyriac literature is by far the most prodigious of the various Aramaic languages. Its corpus covers poetry, prose, theology, liturgy, hymnody, history, philosophy, science, medicine and natural history. Much of this wealth remains unavailable in critical editions or modern translation.\n\nFrom the 7th century onwards, Syriac gradually gave way to Arabic as the spoken language of much of the region, excepting northern Iraq. The Mongol invasions and conquests of the 13th century, and the religiously motivated massacres of Syriac Christians by Timur further contributed to the rapid decline of the language. In many places outside of Upper Mesopotamia, even in liturgy, it was replaced by Arabic.\n\nRevivals of literary Syriac in recent times have led to some success with the creation of newspapers in written Syriac ( \"\") similar to the use of Modern Standard Arabic has been employed since the early decades of the 20th century. Modern literary Syriac has also been used not only in religious literature but also in secular genres often with Assyrian nationalistic themes.\n\nSyriac is spoken as the liturgical language of the Syriac Orthodox Church, as well as by some of its adherents. Syriac has been recognised as an official minority language in Iraq. It is also taught in some public schools in Iraq, the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, Israel, Sweden, Augsburg (Germany) and Kerala (India).\n\nIn 2014, an Assyrian nursery school could finally be opened in Yeşilköy, Istanbul after waging a lawsuit against the Ministry of National Education which had denied it permission, but was required to respect non-Muslim minority rights as specified in the Treaty of Lausanne.\n\nIn August 2016, the Ourhi Centre was founded by the Assyrian community in the city of Qamishli, to educate teachers in order to make Syriac an additional language to be taught in public schools in the Jazira Region of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, which then started with the 2016/17 academic year.\n\nMany Syriac words, like those in other Semitic languages, are built out of triconsonantal roots, collations of three Syriac consonants with variable vowel (and some consonant) sets as a \"glue\". For example, the root , \"\", has the basic meaning of \"taking\", and the following are some words that can be formed from this root:\n\n\nMost Syriac nouns are built from triliteral roots. Nouns carry grammatical gender (masculine or feminine), they can be either singular or plural in number (a very few can be dual) and can exist in one of three grammatical states. These states should not be confused with grammatical cases in other languages.\n\n\nHowever, very quickly in the development of Classical Syriac, the emphatic state became the ordinary form of the noun, and the absolute and construct states were relegated to certain stock phrases (for example, , , \"man, person\", literally \"son of man\").\n\nIn Old and early Classical Syriac, most genitive noun relationships are built using the construct state, but contrary to the genitive case, it is the head-noun which is marked by the construct state. Thus, , , means \"the taxes of the kingdom\". Quickly, the construct relationship was abandoned and replaced by the use of the relative particle , \"\". Thus, the same noun phrase becomes , , where both nouns are in the emphatic state. Very closely related nouns can be drawn into a closer grammatical relationship by the addition of a pronominal suffix. Thus, the phrase can be written as , . In this case, both nouns continue to be in the emphatic state, but the first has the suffix that makes it literally read \"her taxes\" (\"kingdom\" is feminine), and thus is \"her taxes, [those] of the kingdom\".\n\nAdjectives always agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify. Adjectives are in the absolute state if they are predicative, but agree with the state of their noun if attributive. Thus, , ', means \"the taxes are evil\", whereas , ', means \"evil taxes\".\n\nMost Syriac verbs are built on triliteral roots as well. Finite verbs carry person, gender (except in the first person) and number, as well as tense and conjugation. The non-finite verb forms are the infinitive and the active and passive participles.\n\nSyriac has only two true morphological tenses: perfect and imperfect. Whereas these tenses were originally aspectual in Aramaic, they have become a truly temporal past and future tenses respectively. The present tense is usually marked with the participle followed by the subject pronoun. However, such pronouns are usually omitted in the case of the third person. This use of the participle to mark the present tense is the most common of a number of \"compound\" tenses that can be used to express varying senses of tense and aspect.\n\nSyriac also employs derived verb stems such as are present in other Semitic languages. These are regular modifications of the verb's root to express other changes in meaning. The first stem is the ground state, or ' (this name models the shape of the root) form of the verb, which carries the usual meaning of the word. The next is the intensive stem, or ', form of the verb, which usually carries an intensified meaning. The third is the extensive stem, or ', form of the verb, which is often causative in meaning. Each of these stems has its parallel passive conjugation: the ', ' and ' respectively. To these six cardinal stems are added a few irregular stems, like the ' and ', which generally have an extensive meaning.\n\nPhonologically, like the other Northwest Semitic languages, Syriac has 22 consonants. The consonantal phonemes are:\n\nPhonetically, there is some variation in the pronunciation of Syriac in its various forms. The various Modern Eastern Aramaic vernaculars have quite different pronunciations, and these sometimes influence how the classical language is pronounced, for example, in public prayer. Classical Syriac has two major streams of pronunciation: western and eastern.\n\nSyriac shares with Aramaic a set of lightly-contrasted stop/fricative pairs. In different variations of a certain lexical root, a root consonant might exist in stop form in one variation and fricative form in another. In the Syriac alphabet, a single letter is used for each pair. Sometimes a dot is placed above the letter (\"quššāyā\" \"strengthening\"; equivalent to a dagesh in Hebrew) to mark that the stop pronunciation is required, and a dot is placed below the letter (\"rukkāḵā\" \"softening\") to mark that the fricative pronunciation is required. The pairs are:\n\nAs with other Semitic languages, Syriac has a set of five emphatic consonants. These are consonants that are articulated or released in the pharynx or slightly higher. The set consists of:\n\nSyriac also has a rich array of sibilants:\n\nAs with most Semitic languages, the vowels of Syriac are mostly subordinated to consonants. Especially in the presence of an emphatic consonant, vowels tend to become mid-centralised.\n\nClassical Syriac had the following set of distinguishable vowels:\n\nIn the western dialect, has become , and the original has merged with . In eastern dialects there is more fluidity in the pronunciation of front vowels, with some speakers distinguishing five qualities of such vowels, and others only distinguishing three. Vowel length is generally not important: close vowels tend to be longer than open vowels.\n\nThe open vowels form diphthongs with the approximants and .

As a kid, Vahe-Vahian had been the ocular witness of the assassination of his two brothers and father, and those atrocious scenes haunted him the rest of his life. After the many vicissitudes of his life, he completed his tertiary studies in 1930, with a BSc in Structural Engineering from the American University of Beirut. The next four years he taught physics and mathematics to the upper classes in Broumana High School, and then, in 1935 he was invited to Melkonian Institute of Education in Nicosia, Cyprus, as lecturer of Armenian language and literature.\n\nIn 1936, in Melkonian, Vahe-Vahian met Ashkhen Shadan, a fellow teacher, and got married in 1938. They had three children, Tsolak, Vahram and Shogher.\n\nThe death of Ashkhen in 1955 left her husband consumed. Vahe-Vahian, besides his daily occupation as a teacher to meet the needs of his family, was struggling at the time with the publication of \"Ani\", an Armenian monthly of Literature and Art, which was interrupted for a while. In 1968, Vahe-Vahian published a series of poems dedicated to his departed wife under the title of Մատեան Սիրոյ եւ Մորմոքի (\"Book of Love and Grief\").\n\nIn 1957 Vahe-Vahian remarried to Anahid Topjian, and they had a daughter Sheila (1958). His book of poems, Ղօղանջ ու Մրմունջ Վերջալուսային (\"Twilight Chime and Murmur\") (1990) is dedicated to Anahid for her affactionate and coddling support.\n\nIn 1976, Vahe-Vahian, for a second time, was devastated by the death of Vahram in a car-crash, and described his shock and grief in a book of 29 poems, Յուշարձան Վահրամիս (\"Monument in Memory to Vahram) (1977). He first learned about the death of his son, when he was travelling around the United States and Canada on a fund raising mission for bereaved Armenians in Lebanon.\n\nIn his twenties, Vahe-Vahian had an emotionally intense sentimental life, appropriate to his young age. In the third section \"Intimate letters\" of the book Բանաստեղծին Սիրտը (\"The Heart of the Poet\") (2012), we encounter his first platonic love letter to Mrs. Lucie Potoukian (Tosbath), written at the age of 24. Later, he, with a greater out-pouring of emotions, corresponds with the elder sister of Lucie, Siran Seza, a prose writer and the editor of newly published\"Yeridasart Hayouhi\" Երիտասարդ Հայուհի (\"The Young Armenian\"), and with Alice Sinanian. Chronologically, from the first and to the last letter addressed to Siran Seza (11 September 1935), these love letters demonstrate the noble, sincere and genuine sentiments of the author, written in the sweet resonance and the magnificent architecture of the Western Armenian language, different from the language of his other letters, and which can certainly be considered as a literary tour de force by itself.\nFrom 1946 onwards to his death in 1998, Vahe-Vahian took the decision to live and stay in Lebanon, despite the continuous civil war in the area from 1975 to 1990, with the strong conviction that the dismantling of the Armenian Community in Lebanon would be the last blow of mercy to the Armenian Diaspora.\n\nHis primary education in the local 'Armenian National School' in Gürün was interrupted in 1914 by the deportation. As a child he lived the terror of Turkish atrocities, which was occasionally reflected in his literature.\n\nSurviving the Armenian Genocide as an orphan, after having been forced out of Turkey, in 1919 he returned to Aintab at the armistice with his mother, where he attended the local 'Vartanian School'. In 1921 he finally settled in Aleppo (Syria), where he continued his studies at the Armenian Evangelical School, which later became the Aleppo College run by American missionaries. Still eager to learn, in 1925 he enrolled in the American University of Beirut where he gained a B.S. degree in Structural Engineering in 1930.\n\nIn 1931 he commenced teaching Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at Broumana Senior High School in Lebanon. In 1935 he was invited to assume the Armenian Language and Literature position vacated by Vahan Tekeyan at the Melkonian Educational Institute.\n\nIn the autumn of 1946 he moved to Beirut where he launched the monthly magazine 'Ani' of Armenian Literature and Art acting as the editor for the next 9 years. Ani has served as a pacesetter in modern Armenian literature by introducing new works from Armenia to Diaspora readers, and nurturing young talents in the Diaspora.\n\nIn 1947 he was appointed part-time teacher of Armenian Language and Literature in senior high schools in Beirut, patronised by the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU).\n\nIn 1964 he founded the 'Yervant Hussissian Armenology Institute' in Beirut, and held the position of Principal and lecturer of Armenian Language and Literature. Over the span of a decade, hundreds of Armenian teachers were educated to subsequently pursue their chosen profession at different Armenian institutions all over the world.\n\nHolder of several social and cultural posts in the Armenian community, both in Cyprus and Lebanon, he was invited to Armenia on several occasions in 1946, 1975, 1978 and 1981 to participate in literary conferences, attended university celebrations of outstanding historical events and met with prolific Armenian writers of the time.\n\nAlways on the go, first in 1946 then in 1976, during the devastating situation of the Armenians at the start of the civil war in Lebanon, he was sent on a mission to the USA and Canada to undertake fundraising activities organised by the Central Committee of AGBU in America on behalf of bereaved Armenians in Lebanon.\n\nIn 1970, the Catholicosate of Antelias (Lebanon) presented him with the Gold Medal for his prolific career as an educator and a writer. He was also awarded, the order of Saint Mesrop Mashtots by Armenia's Cultural Ministry for his devotion to Armenian culture and heritage in 1981.\n\nIn 1955 and 1978 respectively, he edited and published with detailed prefaces, the works of eminent poets Madtheos Zarifian and Vahan Tekeyan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42677733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42677733", "title": "Valyrian languages", "text": "Valyrian languages\n\nThe Valyrian languages are a fictional language family in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, and in their television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nIn the novels, High Valyrian and its descendant languages are often mentioned, but not developed beyond a few words. For the TV series, linguist David J. Peterson created the High Valyrian language, as well as the derivative languages Astapori and Meereenese Valyrian, based on the fragments given in the novels. Valyrian, alongside Dothraki, has been described as \"the most convincing fictional tongues since Elvish\".\n\nIn the world of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", High Valyrian occupies a cultural niche similar to that of Latin in medieval Europe. The novels describe it as no longer being used as a language of everyday communication, but rather as a language of learning and education among the nobility of Essos and Westeros, with much literature and song composed in Valyrian.\n\nTo create the Dothraki and Valyrian languages to be spoken in \"Game of Thrones\", HBO selected the linguist David J. Peterson through a competition among conlangers. The producers gave Peterson a largely free hand in developing the languages, as, according to Peterson, George R. R. Martin himself was not very interested in the linguistic aspect of his works. The already published novels include only a few words of High Valyrian, including \"valar morghulis\" (\"all men must die\"), \"valar dohaeris\" (\"all men must serve\") and \"dracarys\" (\"dragonfire\"). For the forthcoming novel \"The Winds of Winter\", Peterson has supplied Martin with additional Valyrian translations.\n\nPeterson commented that he considered Martin's choice of \"dracarys\" unfortunate because of its (presumably intended) similarity to the Latin word for dragon, \"\". Because the Latin language does not exist in the fictional world of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", Peterson chose to treat the similarity as coincidental and made \"dracarys\" an independent lexeme; his High Valyrian term for dragon is \"zaldrīzes\". The phrases \"valar morghulis\" and \"valar dohaeris\", on the other hand, became the foundation of the language's conjugation system. Another word, \"trēsy\", meaning \"son\", was coined in honour of Peterson's 3000th Twitter follower.\n\nPeterson did not create a High Valyrian writing system at the time, but he commented that he \"was thinking something more like Egyptian's system of hieroglyphs—not in style, necessarily, but in their functionality. Egyptian had an alphabet, of sorts, a couple of phonetically-based systems, and a logography all layered on top of one another.\" In the third season's episode \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\", Talisa is seen writing a Valyrian letter in the Latin alphabet, because according to Peterson, \"it didn't seem worthwhile to create an entire writing system for what ultimately is kind of a throwaway shot\".\n\nAt the start of June 2013, there were 667 High Valyrian words.\n\nNotes:\n\nVowels with a macron over them (ī, ȳ, ū, ē, ō and ā) are long, held for twice as long as short vowels. Some words are distinguished simply by their vowel length in High Valyrian. The rounded vowels and may not be pronounced in modern High Valyrian, as a non-native or prestige language and did not survive into the descendant languages. As a result, while Daenerys Targaryen's first name may generally be pronounced by characters in \"Game of Thrones\", in High Valyrian it would have been closer to , with a diphthong in the first syllable and a rounded vowel in the last. The long vowels have also been lost in some derived languages; in season 3 of \"Game of Thrones\", we hear Astapori Valyrian, from which all long vowels have been lost.\n\nSyllable stress is penultimate unless the penultimate syllable is light and the antepenultimate syllable is heavy, in which case stress is on the antepenultimate. As a highly inflected language, word order is flexible (a feature lost in derived languages), but sentences with relative clauses are head-final.\n\nThere are four grammatical numbers in High Valyrian — singular, plural, paucal and collective. For example, \"vala\" \"man\" (nom. sing.); \"vali\" \"men\" (nom. pl.); \"valun\" \"some men\" (nom. pau.); \"valar\" \"all men\" (nom. coll.). The collective can itself be modified by number as a new noun declension, for example \"azantys\" \"knight, soldier\" (nom. sing.) → \"azantyr\" \"army\" (nom. coll.); \"azantyr\" \"army\" (nom. sing.) → \"azantyri\" \"armies\" (nom. pl.).\n\nNouns have eight cases — nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental, comitative and vocative, though the instrumental and comitative are not distinguished in all declensions, nor are the genitive, dative and locative always distinguished in the plural. Both prepositions and postpositions are used to form other cases; for example, the ablative is formed with the preposition \"hen\" + the locative (e.g. \"hen lentot\", \"from a house\") while the superessive is formed with the postposition \"bē\" following the genitive (e.g. \"lento bē\", \"on top of a house\").\n\nThere are four grammatical genders, which do not align with biological sex. The Valyrian names for the genders are:\n\nAnimate and individuatable nouns are generally in the lunar or solar classes, while other nouns are generally classified as terrestrial or aquatic. The names of the classes derive from the nouns themselves, which are prototypical members of each gender. Peterson describes Valyrian gender as being inherent but more predictable from phonology than gender in French, with some of the derivational properties of the noun classes of Bantu languages. As a result of the phonological predictability, many words for humans (which tend to end \"-a\" or \"-ys\") are lunar or solar; many foods and plants (often ending \"-on\") are terrestrial.\n\nAccording to Peterson, \"what defines declension classes in High Valyrian\" can be divined by paying \"close attention to the singular and plural numbers\" and noting \"where cases are conflated and where they aren't\". In the following tables, adjacent case conflations are merged into the same table cell; other cases that share a form with another are underlined.\n\nWhile nouns have four grammatical numbers, verb conjugations have only been described in the singular and the plural; paucals trigger plural agreement and collectives trigger singular agreement. There are two paradigms of verbs, those with a stem ending with a consonant and those with a stem ending with a vowel; the tables below show examples of three tenses in the active voice. It is possible to tell which paradigm is in use from the first person plural indicative — consonant stems will always end in \"-i\", whereas vowels stems will end in \"-ī\". Verbs with stems ending in a vowel follow a pattern where that stem-terminal vowel might change — \"-a\" and \"-i\" do not change, \"-e\" becomes \"-i\", but \"-o\" and \"-u\" both become \"-v\". Verb stems may never end in a long vowel or a diphthong. There is a subjunctive mood that is not only used in subordinate clauses, but also in all negative statements.\n\nAdjectives have three declension classes. Like verbs, adjectives only have two number forms — a singular, which is also used for the collective, and a plural, also used for paucal numbers. Adjectives may be both prepositive (e.g. \"the \"white\" shoe\") or post-positive (e.g. \"the body \"politic\"\"); when prepositive some further rules apply.\n\nSeveral forms of elision and consonant assimilation occur with prepositive adjectives:\n\n\nClass adjectives decline differently for each of the four noun classes. The exemplar is \"kasta\", meaning \"blue and green\". As before, in the following tables, adjacent case conflations are merged into the same table cell; other cases that share a form with another are underlined.\n\nNotes:\nAdjective classes and both conflate rather more forms, failing to distinguish between solar and lunar nouns and failing to distinguish between terrestrial and aquatic nouns. Class also has some subclasses, that have not yet been detailed. The exemplars used here are the class adjective \"adere\" (\"sleek, smooth, slippery, fast, quick\") and the class adjective \"ēlie\" (\"first\").\n\nClass adjectives also experience vowel changes when subject to the elision described above. When a lunar or solar form is elided to a syllable containing \"-ȳ-\" (such forms are highlighted in the table below), this \"-ȳ-\" mutates to \"-io-\"; this does not occur with terrestrial or aquatic forms. Compare:\n\nNotes:\n\nSince a course in High Valyrian for English speakers has been in the works at the Duolingo Language Incubator. David J. Peterson is one of the contributors to the course. The beta version was released on July 12, 2017.\n\nIn the world of the novel and TV series, the Nine Free Cities of Essos speak variants of High Valyrian, described by the character Tyrion in \"A Dance with Dragons\" as \"not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues\". The cities of Slaver's Bay speak related languages, descended from High Valyrian with the substrate of the local Ghiscari languages. Peterson noted that with regard to the vocabulary of the derived languages, \"If it’s got a j in an odd place, it’s probably Ghiscari in origin.\"\n\nPeterson described the relationship between High Valyrian and the Free Cities languages as being similar to that between classical Latin and the Romance languages, or more accurately between Classical Arabic and the modern varieties of Arabic, in that High Valyrian is intelligible, with some difficulty, to a speaker of a local Essoan language.\n\nThe first derivative Valyrian language to be featured in the series was Astapori Valyrian, a variety from the city of Astapor in Slaver's Bay. It appeared in the third-season premiere episode \"Valar Dohaeris\". Peterson created the Astapori dialogue by first writing the text in High Valyrian, then applying a series of regular grammar and sound changes to simulate the changes in natural languages over a long period of time.\n\nFor example, Astapori Valyrian has lost all long vowels (designated with a macron) and most diphthongs. Between vowels, [b, d, g] have become [v, ð, ɣ]; subsequently, [p, t, k] have become [b, d, g] in the same environment.\nAs a result, an \"Unsullied\" is rendered as \"Dovaogēdy\" in High Valyrian, but as \"Dovoghedhy\" in Astapori. Similarly, Astapori Valyrian has lost the case system of High Valyrian, so the word order is more reliably subject–verb–object (SVO) and the four genders of High Valyrian have been reduced to two, with three definite articles: \"ji\" (animate singular, derived from High Valyrian \"ziry\" \"him/her (accusative)\"), \"vi\" (inanimate singular, derived from High Valyrian \"ūī\" \"it (accusative)\"), and \"po\" (plural, derived from High Valyrian \"pōnte\" \"them (accusative)\"). There is also an indefinite article, \"me\" , derived from High Valyrian \"mēre\" (\"one\"). Word stress is less predictable than in High Valyrian, but commands are stressed word-finally (for example: \"ivetrá\").\n\nMeereenese Valyrian appears in Seasons 4 and 6 of \"Game of Thrones\". Like Astapori Valyrian, it lacked long vowels as well as the sound /y/. However, its phonology departs considerably more from High Valyrian; for example, \"Unsullied\" is Thowoá [θo.woˈa], whereas in High Valyrian it is Dovaogēdy [do.vao.ˈɡeː.dy] and in Astapori Valyrian it is Dovoghedhy [do.vo.ˈɣe.ði].\n\n"}

The allusion is to Wardour Street's former reputation as a centre for dealers in antique and reproduction furniture and the supposed propensity of their kind for passing off modern imitations as the genuine article.\n\nOften attributed to H.W. Fowler, the phrase was in fact coined by the historian Archibald Ballantyne in an article entitled \"Wardour Street English\", published in Longman's Magazine in 1888, in which, for example, he characterized William Morris's translation of the \"Odyssey\" as “not literary English of any date; this is Wardour-Street Early English—a perfectly modern article with a sham appearance of the real antique about it.” The phrase appeared sporadically thereafter in literary criticism, particularly in reference to Morris's work, and there is a brief mention of \"antiquarian rubbish, Wardour Street English\" in \"The King's English\", by the brothers H.W. and F.G. Fowler, but it was the article \"Wardour Street\" in \"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage\", written by H.W. Fowler after his brother's death, that gave the expression broad currency. In his typical idiosyncratic style, Fowler wrote:\nAs Wardour Street itself offers to those who live in modern houses the opportunity of picking up an antique or two that will be conspicuous for good or ill among their surroundings, so this article offers to those who write modern English a selection of oddments calculated to establish (in the eyes of some readers) their claim to be persons of taste & writers of beautiful English.\nWords deprecated by Fowler include such examples as \"anent, aught, ere, erstwhile, haply, maugre, oft, perchance, thither, to wit, varlet, withal\" and \"wot\". Some words that Fowler found objectionable, such as \"albeit, for(e)bears\" and \"proven\" have found their way into normal English idiom and have been replaced in more recent editions of \"Modern English Usage\" by, amongst others, \"betimes, peradventure, quoth\" and \"whilom\". None of these lists is exhaustive.\n\nWardour Street English includes not only an incongruous choice of vocabulary, but also pseudo-archaic sentence structure. Fowler, in the first edition of \"Modern English Usage\", criticized the use of inverted protasis with \"had\", \"should\" and \"were\" (as in 'Had he done this, then…', rather than 'If he had done this, then…'), although this objection does not appear in later editions. A more recent edition gives as examples the, at first glance, almost incomprehensible 'Bread and wine needs a man to fight and die' and 'Us enchants he, but eke frightens.'\n\nAs Butterfield points out, 21st Century critics are more likely to be exercised by what is in many respects the opposite process, namely the incongruous use of modern vernacular in popular broadcast period dramas. An example of this is the number of web pages devoted to pointing out, and arguing over, anachronistic language in the popular British television programme \"Downton Abbey\". Although much of this is probably accidental, unlike the deliberate Wardour Street English, the producers have agreed that the language has been modernized in order to allow modern audiences to \"relate to\" the characters.\n\n\n"}

It is recognized as signalling intended confrontations on land, sea, and air.\n\nAs an analogy, \"warning shot\" can be said of any action of declaration, especially a demonstration of power, intended or perceived as a last warning before hostile measures.\n\nDuring the 18th century, a warning shot (in nautical terms, often called a shot across the bow) could be fired towards any ship whose \"colours\" (nationality) had to be ascertained. According to the law of the sea, a ship thus hailed had to fly her flag and confirm it with a gunshot. Warning shots may still be used in modern times to signal a vessel to stop or keep off and may be fired from other ships, boats, or aircraft.\n\nWarning shots are also used in military aviation, to demand some action of an unresponsive and presumed hostile aircraft; the most common demand would be for the aircraft to change course. The ostensible justification for firing shots is that tracer rounds are very bright and would immediately gain the attention of a crew whose radio is non-functioning, or who might not have noticed radio transmissions. The objective of warning shots is to demonstrate the ability to shoot, and threaten the crew of the unresponsive aircraft that they will be shot down if they do not comply.\n\n"}

Also common in telecom (especially VoIP) is the term grey route, which defines a route that is legal for one country or the party on one end, but illegal on the alternative end.\n\nAn example of the white/grey/black trichotomy is often seen in telecom routes from the United States to India. In India, a telecom oligopoly is granted to a few large corporations. Hence, all legal (\"white\") telecom traffic to the country is subject to the rates imposed by these corporations. To overcome this restriction for the purpose of achieving lower costs for consumers, and to make a profit in the process, many small parties set up VoIP routers in homes and offices around India. Telecom traffic from the Foreign Countries like USA, UK is sent to these VoIP routers via IP and terminated to the local Indian PSTN. This process is illegal in India (\"black\"), but completely lawful in the USA (\"white\"). A route like this, white on one end and black on the other is said to be \"grey\".\n\nA \"SIM box\" is an unofficial voice over IP gateway which uses multiple mobile telephones and SIM cards for PSTN connectivity, while connecting to the Internet by conventional means. These are normally operated clandestinely in third-world calling destinations as the \"black\" end of a \"grey route\" where conventional private branch exchange lines (such as T-carrier primary rate interface) are not available to VoIP operators due to a hostile local regulatory environment.\n\nIn India, for instance, an Internet Service Licensee is not permitted to have PSTN/PLMN connectivity as voice communication to and from a telephone connected to PSTN/PLMN and following E.164 numbering is prohibited in India. By using licensing restrictions and regulations to ensure that the interconnection between the PSTN/PLMN network and Internet is not permitted, the government in India delivers a lucrative monopoly to International Long Distance (ILD) service providers licensed under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act as the only carriers officially allowed to carry international long distance traffic into India.\n\n"}

Leigh, in his article \"Moving towards new forms of social success\", describing the new forms of social success in the United States, and in Western societies. The term (a contraction of the expression “windy winners”) goes back to the original way of experiencing social success by individuals uninhibited with regards to their own success, not looking as much to reconcile rival existential expectations (such as the bobos, for example) but rather to juxtapose them in a way which is not seeking to constitute a system.\n\nThe analysis of this new group is positioned along the same lines as the social success models embodied respectively by yuppies, “hardcore winners” (traders and other “golden boys” of the 1980s), and then bobos. It borrows from the critical sociology of Michael Hartmann, as well as employment sociologists Peter Meiksins and Peter Whalley, whose work \"Putting work in its place: a quiet revolution\"\ndetails the paradigm shift borne by the winders within the American employment market. As J. W. Leigh puts it: “In cultural terms, for example, he is a \"multi-consumer\": capable of frequenting art galleries or the screens of a public cinema, and listening to Haydn and Bach as much as Beyonce or Michael Jackson.” To this regard, the winder is considered a “cultural omnivore”\n\nFrom this point of view, the “winder” is one of the many avatars of the ability of superior social classes to legitimise their own situation via positive and always renewing value systems.\n\n\n"}

They are an integral component of the wine industry worldwide. The design and construction of wine caves represents a unique application of underground construction techniques.\n\nThe storage of wine underground offers the benefits of energy efficiency and optimum use of limited land area. Wine caves naturally provide both high humidity and cool temperatures, which are key to the storage and aging of wine.\n\nThe history of wine cave construction in the United States dates back to the 1860s in Sonoma, and the 1870s in the Napa Valley region. In 1857, Agoston Harazsthy founded Buena Vista Winery and in 1862, Buena Vista Winery's Press House was completed, and in 1864, a second building now called the Champagne Cellars was completed. In total, Buena Vista Winery had five caves among the two buildings in operation in 1864. Jacob Schram, a German immigrant and barber, founded Schramsberg Vineyards near Calistoga, California in 1862. Eight years later, Schram found new employment for the Chinese laborers who had recently finished constructing tunnels and grades over the Sierra Nevada Mountains for the Union Pacific Transcontinental Railroad. He hired them to dig a network of caves through the soft Sonoma Volcanics Formation rock underlying his vineyard.\n\nAnother Chinese workforce took time away from their regular vineyard work to excavate a labyrinth of wine-aging caves beneath the Beringer Vineyards near St. Helena, California. These caves exceeded 1,200 ft (365 m) long, 17 ft (5 m) wide and 7 ft (2 m) high. The workers used pick-axes and shovels – and on occasion, chisel steel, double jacks and black powder – to break the soft rock. They worked by candlelight, and removed the excavated material in wicker baskets. At least 12 wine storage caves were constructed by these methods.\n\nFrom the late 19th century to the early 1970s, the development of wine caves went through a long period of “dark ages.” No new caves were built, and many existing caves were abandoned or fell into disrepair. A “renaissance” of cave building began in 1972 when Alf Burtleson Construction started the rehabilitation of the old Beringer wine caves, and was followed by the design and construction of new caves.\n\nIn 1982, the Far Niente Winery completed the first of these “new age” wine caves in the Napa Valley AVA. The cave was only 60 ft (18 m) long and was used exclusively to age the wine and to store empty barrels. In 1991, 1995, and 2001, the caves were expanded. New rooms and storage areas were added, featuring different crown heights and intriguing shapes. An octagonal room was constructed for a wine library and a round domed room was added in the complex’s center. Far Niente Winery caves now encompass about 40,000 sq ft (3,700 m²).\n\nIn 1991, Condor Earth Technologies Inc. joined with Alf Burtleson on the design and construction of the elaborate Jarvis Wine Cave project. Over 45,000 sq ft (4,200 m²) of underground winery and cave space was constructed, with cave spans exceeding 85 ft (25.5 m) in width. At Jarvis, the entire winery is contained within the tunneled areas, including crushing, fermentation, barrel storage, bottling, lab, office, marketing, and hospitality areas. These caves are open for public tours by appointment.\n\nHigh humidity minimizes evaporation. Wine makers consider humidity over 75% for reds and over 85% for whites to be ideal for wine aging and barrel storage. Humidity in wine caves ranges naturally from 70 to 90%.\n\nIn Northern California, wine barrel evaporation in a surface warehouse is on the order of 4 gallons (15.1 liters) per each 60 gallon (227 liter) barrel per year. In a wine cave, barrel evaporation is reduced to about 1 gallon (3.8 liters) per barrel per year.\n\nSince red wines are usually barreled and aged for two years, this represents a 10% gross volume loss difference. For white wines, which are barreled and aged for about one year, a 5% loss difference is realized, a significant savings.\n\nThe wine industry has long considered a constant temperature between 55 °F and 60 °F (13.0 °C and 15.5 °C) to be optimal for wine storage and aging. The air temperatures in Northern California result in a uniform underground temperature of about 58 °F (14.5 °C), optimal for wine caves. A surface warehouse requires energy to cool, heat, and humidify. While the most basic wine cave can cost over $100 per sq ft to construct, reduced energy costs result in a net savings over the long term.\n\nIn the Napa-Sonoma wine growing region, as in many areas of California, land values are high. Non-agricultural development is often restricted. A storage warehouse reduces the land available to grow grapes, impacts open space and natural habitats, and precludes other land uses. Land-use regulation in California places limitations on the types and locations of land development. Many land use restrictions and permitting requirements do not apply to underground space. As of 2004, there were an estimated 130 to 150 caves used for wine aging, barrel storage, and tasting rooms in Northern California.\n\nMarketing is an important component of the modern wine industry, and many caves serve varied marketing and public relations functions. Recently constructed caves contain commercial and private kitchens, wine libraries, concert and exhibit halls, staff offices, elevators, restrooms, and other amenities. Some have high-end interiors, including ceramic and stone flooring, masonry-lined walls and ceilings, sculpture and artwork, mood lighting, fountains, waterfalls, and chandeliers. At Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, a Foucault pendulum swings continuously across a bed of black sand in the central exhibit hall.\n\nThe challenge for the design and construction of most wine caves is to create a fairly wide span in weak rock with low cover. The size of a typical wine barrel storage cave is 13 to 18 ft (4 to 5.5 m) wide and 10 to 13 ft (3 to 4 m) high. Constructed caves, however, range up to 85 ft (30 m) in width and 50 ft (15 m) in height; difficult to achieve in poor quality rock.\n\nIn areas of complex geology, good portal sites are hard to find. A typical wine cave is constructed with two or more portal sites, for safety and operational reasons. At least one portal leads directly outside, but in many cases at least one portal makes a direct connection to a winery building.\n\nMost portals into the wine caves have rock/soil overburden heights less than 0.2 times their entrance heights and widths. The height of the portal face normally ranges from 12 to 20 ft (3.5 to 6 m). The portal areas are seldom stripped of the loose soil material and the portals are cut from the native ground surface using excavators. The side slopes of the portal are often laid back to 0.5H:1V or steeper, and the portal face is excavated to vertical or near vertical.\n\nThe construction of cave interiors can be complicated by the elaborate curves and labyrinth-style floor plans selected by some owners for their wine caves. As the ground surface slopes upward, providing more cover and usually sounder rock, caves can accommodate multiple drifts. Where possible, the cave is designed and constructed to provide at least 1.2 times their width of cover at intersections. Room and pillar layouts, similar to underground mine design, provide an economical construction arrangement. Tunnel legs are usually 30 to 100 ft (9 to 30 m) in length and pillars are typically a minimum of 20 ft (6 m) wide.\n\nOn most occasions, the New Austrian Tunneling Method (single or multiple face), also known now as Sequential Excavation Method (SEM), with minor innovative technology advances, is used to excavate and support wine caves.\n\nThe caves are typically excavated in an inverted horseshoe shape with a crown radius and with straight or curved legs. The tunnels are usually excavated using a tunnel roadheader or a milling head attachment on an excavator. The spoils behind the roadheader conveyor belt are dumped on the invert and mucked out using a rubber-tired skid loader or a load-haul-dump (LHD) mining machine.\n\nInitially, the excavation advance is likely to be limited to 2 ft (0.6 m) without initial ground support. Once turned under, and depending on ground conditions, the unsupported advance may be increased to 4 ft (1.2 m), 6 ft (1.8 m), and longer increments. The maximum advance without initial ground support may reach 20 ft (6 m) or more in stable volcanic ash tuff. In sheared serpentinite, deeply weathered lava rock or wet clayey ground, however, unstable ground conditions may limit the unsupported advance to less than 2 ft (0.6 m).\n\nShotcrete reinforcement and ground support is utilized at the tunnel portals and in the interior of the wine caves. At the portals, soil nail and shotcrete walls are typically used for permanent support and are constructed from the top down in lifts. Soil nails are installed 4 to 6 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) apart in the horizontal and vertical directions. The shotcrete is typically a minimum of 6 inches (15 cm) thick and reinforced with welded wire fabric. The typical 4,000 psi (28 MPa) design strength mix is applied using the wet process.\n\nWithin the caves, the initial ground support is usually fiber-reinforced shotcrete. A minimum of 2 inches (5 cm) thickness of wet mix shotcrete is applied around the exposed ground perimeter following each day’s advance. As cave dimensions and ground conditions require, additional layers of shotcrete and welded wire fabric follow on subsequent days. The shotcrete mix is a 4,000 psi (28 MPa) compressive strength design. In some cases, pattern or spot rock bolts are also installed. Where wider and taller halls are used, modeling is employed to assist with the liner design.\n\nInterior finishing of the caves is an integral part of the construction process. Waterproofing details are important for the interiors of wine caves. Wet spots and water seeps are unsightly, and can cause maintenance and safety problems. Moisture vapor migration through the cave liner, however, is desirable to maintain humidity.\n\nMost contractors install prefabrication drainage strips at regular intervals between the native ground and the shotcrete liner. The drain strips relieve the hydrostatic pressure, but have little effect on wet spots and water seeps. Xypex has been used for many years to mitigate seepage, either as a shotcrete admixture or spray applied, with relatively good success. Where excessive groundwater is present, membranes placed between successive shotcrete layers have been used. Many new products, including admixtures and membranes, are being evaluated and tested to improve moisture conditions. The wine cave industry in Northern California is at the forefront of waterproofing technology implementation.\n\nAfter the cave complex has been completely excavated, waterproofed, and initially supported, a 2 inches (5 cm) thickness of final shotcrete or plain/colored gunite is applied to the walls and arch. Utility conduits and piping are encased within the final layer of shotcrete in the walls and arch and placed under the concrete floor slab. Reinforced concrete slabs are usually 6 in. (15 cm) thick and are underlain by subdrain.\n\nTo support their varied uses, wine cave complexes may contain as many as 13 different utility systems. These include systems for hot and cold domestic water and processing water, electric power, lighting, sound and water features, battery emergency power, compressed gas systems, communications and radio relays, automatic ventilation, and computerized sensors and climate controls.\n\n\n\n"}
