The term is not synonymous with \"graduate\"; one can be an alumnus without graduating. (Burt Reynolds, alumnus but not graduate of Florida State, is an example.) An alumnus can also be and is more recently expanded to include a former employee of an organization and it may also apply to a former member, contributor, or inmate.\n\nThe Latin noun \"alumnus\" means “foster son” or “pupil” and is derived from the verb \"alere\" \"to nourish\". The word \"alumnus\" appears in Roman law to describe a child placed in fosterage. According to John Boswell, the word \"is nowhere defined in relation to status, privilege, or obligation.\" Citing the research of John Boswell, who studied the many inscriptions about \"alumni,\" Boswell concluded that it referred to exposed children who were taken into a household where they were \"regarded as somewhere between an heir and a slave, partaking in different ways of both categories.\" Despite the warmth of feelings between the parent and child, \"an \"alumnus\" might be treated both as a beloved child and as a household servant.\"\n\nAn alumnus, alumna, or alumnum is a former student and most often a graduate of an educational institution (school, college, university).

He is remembered for the derision that greeted his Latin translations of Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", which came to epitomise bad verse. He translated the original Greek into Latin hexameters. The satirist Persius poured scorn on Labeo. Later his name was used by English poets of the Elizabethan era to attack each other's verse.\n\nHis writings have not survived, but a single line of his translation has been preserved in scholia: \"crudum manduces Priamum Priamique pisinnos\", which was Labeo's translation of the words - ὠμòν ßεßρώΘοις Πρίαμον Πριάμοιó τε παîδας (Iliad, iv, 35). On the basis of this surviving line, it has been suggested that the translation was considered to be vulgar, since the words 'manduces' and 'pisinnos' would have \"undoubtedly struck Romans as exotically 'low'\". In English the line means, roughly, \"Raw, you'd chew both Priam and Priam's kids.\"\n\nPersius, a contemporary of the translator, refers to Labeo in his \"Satires\" as the epitome of a bad poet, mentioning him in his discussion of his reasons for taking up his pen:\nO curas hominum! o quantum est in rebus inane!<br>\n\"Quis leget haec?\" min tu istud ais? Nemo hercule. \"Nemo?\"<br>\nVel duo, vel nemo. \"Turpe et miserabile.\" Quare?<br>\nNe mihi Polydamas et Troïades Labeonem<br>\nPraetulerint? Nugae!\n\nRGM Nesbitt translates these lines as: \"The toils of men! The emptiness of life! 'Who's going to read that?' Are you talking to me? Nobody, of course. 'Nobody?' Well, two at the most. 'That's a poor show.' Why? Because Polydamas and the Trojan Women may prefer Labeo to me? Bosh.\" Polydamas was a Trojan leader in the \"Iliad\" characterised by his timidity. He and the women of Troy tried to stop Hector making a bold attack on the Greeks.\n\nPersius also says that Labeo must have made the translation while \"drunk with hellebore\" (\"ebria ueratro\").\n\nFollowing Persius' use of the name, Elizabethan English satirists used the name \"Labeo\" as a code for a bad poet. \"Labeo\" appears in Joseph Hall's \"Satires\", in which he is accused of writing bad pastoral, erotic and heroic verse, evidently a reference to poetry of the time. The identity of Hall's \"Labeo\" is disputed. It has been suggested that Michael Drayton may be the target. Samuel Daniel has also been suggested. However, it has been argued that Hall's \"Labeo\" is a composite figure, standing for the vulgarity of modern poetry, as Hall saw it. In the view of Oscar James Campbell, \"The English Labeo is best regarded as a type figure representing each and every one of the assiduous and tasteless Elizabethan translators.\"\n\nLikewise, John Marston mentions \"Labeo\" in \"Pygmalion's Image\", which includes the words, \"So Labeo did complain his love was stone,/Obdurate, flinty, so relentless none.\" It may be that this use of the \"Labeo\" persona is an attack on Shakespeare, since the lines resemble a passage in \"Venus and Adonis\". \n\nJohn Milton in an early essay quotes Persius on Labeo, referring to academic rivalries, \n"}
{"id": "1326932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1326932", "title": "Beamforming", "text": "Beamforming\n\nBeamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. Beamforming can be used at both the transmitting and receiving ends in order to achieve spatial selectivity. The improvement compared with omnidirectional reception/transmission is known as the directivity of the array.\n\nBeamforming can be used for radio or sound waves. It has found numerous applications in radar, sonar, seismology, wireless communications, radio astronomy, acoustics and biomedicine. Adaptive beamforming is used to detect and estimate the signal of interest at the output of a sensor array by means of optimal (e.g. least-squares) spatial filtering and interference rejection.\n\nTo change the directionality of the array when transmitting, a beamformer controls the phase and relative amplitude of the signal at each transmitter, in order to create a pattern of constructive and destructive interference in the wavefront. When receiving, information from different sensors is combined in a way where the expected pattern of radiation is preferentially observed.\n\nFor example, in sonar, to send a sharp pulse of underwater sound towards a ship in the distance, simply transmitting that sharp pulse from every sonar projector in an array simultaneously fails because the ship will first hear the pulse from the speaker that happens to be nearest the ship, then later pulses from speakers that happen to be the further from the ship. The beamforming technique involves sending the pulse from each projector at slightly different times (the projector closest to the ship last), so that every pulse hits the ship at exactly the same time, producing the effect of a single strong pulse from a single powerful projector. The same technique can be carried out in air using loudspeakers, or in radar/radio using antennas.\n\nIn passive sonar, and in reception in active sonar, the beamforming technique involves combining delayed signals from each hydrophone at slightly different times (the hydrophone closest to the target will be combined after the longest delay), so that every signal reaches the output at exactly the same time, making one loud signal, as if the signal came from a single, very sensitive hydrophone. Receive beamforming can also be used with microphones or radar antennas.\n\nWith narrow-band systems the time delay is equivalent to a \"phase shift\", so in this case the array of antennas, each one shifted a slightly different amount, is called a phased array. A narrow band system, typical of radars, is one where the bandwidth is only a small fraction of the center frequency. With wide band systems this approximation no longer holds, which is typical in sonars.\n\nIn the receive beamformer the signal from each antenna may be amplified by a different \"weight.\" Different weighting patterns (e.g., Dolph-Chebyshev) can be used to achieve the desired sensitivity patterns. A main lobe is produced together with nulls and sidelobes. As well as controlling the main lobe width (beamwidth) and the sidelobe levels, the position of a null can be controlled. This is useful to ignore noise or jammers in one particular direction, while listening for events in other directions. A similar result can be obtained on transmission.\n\nFor the full mathematics on directing beams using amplitude and phase shifts, see the mathematical section in phased array.\n\nBeamforming techniques can be broadly divided into two categories:\n\nConventional beamformers use a fixed set of weightings and time-delays (or phasings) to combine the signals from the sensors in the array, primarily using only information about the location of the sensors in space and the wave directions of interest. In contrast, adaptive beamforming techniques (e.g., MUSIC, SAMV) generally combine this information with properties of the signals actually received by the array, typically to improve rejection of unwanted signals from other directions. This process may be carried out in either the time or the frequency domain.\n\nAs the name indicates, an adaptive beamformer is able to automatically adapt its response to different situations. Some criterion has to be set up to allow the adaptation to proceed such as minimizing the total noise output. Because of the variation of noise with frequency, in wide band systems it may be desirable to carry out the process in the frequency domain.\n\nBeamforming can be computationally intensive. Sonar phased array has a data rate low enough that it can be processed in real-time in software, which is flexible enough to transmit or receive in several directions at once. In contrast, radar phased array has a data rate so high that it usually requires dedicated hardware processing, which is hard-wired to transmit or receive in only one direction at a time. However, newer field programmable gate arrays are fast enough to handle radar data in real-time, and can be quickly re-programmed like software, blurring the hardware/software distinction.\n\nSonar beamforming utilizes a similar technique to electromagnetic beamforming, but varies considerably in implementation details. Sonar applications vary from 1 Hz to as high as 2 MHz, and array elements may be few and large, or number in the hundreds yet very small. This will shift sonar beamforming design efforts significantly between demands of such system components as the \"front end\" (transducers, pre-amplifiers and digitizers) and the actual beamformer computational hardware downstream. High frequency, focused beam, multi-element imaging-search sonars and acoustic cameras often implement fifth-order spatial processing that places strains equivalent to Aegis radar demands on the processors.\n\nMany sonar systems, such as on torpedoes, are made up of arrays of up to 100 elements that must accomplish beam steering over a 100 degree field of view and work in both active and passive modes.\n\nSonar arrays are used both actively and passively in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional arrays.\n\n\nSonar differs from radar in that in some applications such as wide-area-search all directions often need to be listened to, and in some applications broadcast to, simultaneously. Thus a multibeam system is needed. In a narrowband sonar receiver the phases for each beam can be manipulated entirely by signal processing software, as compared to present radar systems that use hardware to 'listen' in a single direction at a time.\n\nSonar also uses beamforming to compensate for the significant problem of the slower propagation speed of sound as compared to that of electromagnetic radiation. In side-look-sonars, the speed of the towing system or vehicle carrying the sonar is moving at sufficient speed to move the sonar out of the field of the returning sound \"ping\". In addition to focusing algorithms intended to improve reception, many side scan sonars also employ beam steering to look forward and backward to \"catch\" incoming pulses that would have been missed by a single sidelooking beam.\n\n\nBeamforming techniques used in cellular phone standards have advanced through the generations to make use of more complex systems to achieve higher density cells, with higher throughput.\n\n\nAn increasing number of consumer 802.11ac Wi-Fi devices with MIMO capability can support beamforming to boost data communication rates.\n\nFor receive (but not transmit), there is a distinction between analog and digital beamforming. For example, if there are 100 sensor elements, the \"digital beamforming\" approach entails that each of the 100 signals passes through an analog-to-digital converter to create 100 digital data streams. Then these data streams are added up digitally, with appropriate scale-factors or phase-shifts, to get the composite signals. By contrast, the \"analog beamforming\" approach entails taking the 100 analog signals, scaling or phase-shifting them using analog methods, summing them, and then usually digitizing the \"single\" output data stream.\n\nDigital beamforming has the advantage that the digital data streams (100 in this example) can be manipulated and combined in many possible ways in parallel, to get many different output signals in parallel. The signals from every direction can be measured simultaneously, and the signals can be integrated for a longer time when studying far-off objects and simultaneously integrated for a shorter time to study fast-moving close objects, and so on. This cannot be done as effectively for analog beamforming, not only because each parallel signal combination requires its own circuitry, but more fundamentally because digital data can be copied perfectly but analog data cannot. (There is only so much analog power available, and amplification adds noise.) Therefore, if the received analog signal is split up and sent into a large number of different signal combination circuits, it can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of each.\n\nIn MIMO communication systems with large number of antennas, so called massive MIMO systems, the beamforming algorithms executed at the digital baseband can get very complex. \nIn addition, if all beamforming is done at baseband, each antenna needs its own RF feed. At high frequencies and with large number of antenna elements, this can be very costly, increase loss and complexity in the system. To remedy these issues, hybrid beamforming has been suggested where some of the beamforming is done using analog components and not digital.\n\nThere are many possible different functions that can be performed using analog components instead of at the digital baseband.\n\nBeamforming can be used to try to extract sound sources in a room, such as multiple speakers in the cocktail party problem. This requires the locations of the speakers to be known in advance, for example by using the time of arrival from the sources to mics in the array, and inferring the locations from the distances.\n\nCompared to carrier-wave telecommunications, natural audio contains a variety of frequencies. It is advantageous to separate frequency bands prior to beamforming because different frequencies have different optimal beamform filters (and hence can be treated as separate problems, in parallel, and then recombined afterward). Properly isolating these bands involves specialized non-standard filter banks. In contrast, for example, the standard FFT band-filters implicitly assume that the only frequencies present in the signal are exact harmonics; frequencies which lie between these harmonics will typically activate all of the FFT channels (which is not what is wanted in a beamform analysis). Instead, filters can be designed in which only local frequencies are detected by each channel (while retaining the recombination property to be able to reconstruct the original signal), and these are typically non-orthogonal unlike the FFT basis.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11491013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11491013", "title": "Choke (firearms)", "text": "Choke (firearms)\n\nIn firearms, a choke is a tapered constriction of a shotgun barrel's bore at the muzzle end. Chokes are almost always used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Its purpose is to shape the spread of the shot to gain better range and accuracy. Chokes are implemented as either screw-in chokes, selected for particular applications, or as fixed, permanent chokes, integral to the shotgun barrel.\n\nChokes may be formed at the time of manufacture either as part of the barrel, by squeezing the end of the bore down over a mandrel, or by threading the barrel and screwing in an interchangeable choke tube. Chokes may also be formed even after a barrel is manufactured by increasing the diameter of the bore inside a barrel, creating what is called a \"jug choke\", or by installing screw-in chokes within a barrel. However implemented, a choke typically consists of a conical section that smoothly tapers from the bore diameter down to the choke diameter, followed by a cylindrical section of the choke diameter. Briley Manufacturing, one maker of interchangeable shotgun chokes, uses a conical portion about 3 times the bore diameter in length, so that the shot is gradually squeezed down with minimal deformation. The cylindrical section is shorter, usually \n15 to 19 mm (0.6 to 0.75 inches).\n\nA choke is designed to alter the distribution of the shot as it leaves the firearm. For shooting most game birds and clay pigeons, a desirable pattern is one that is as large as possible while being dense enough to ensure multiple hits on the target. Shotguns intended for defensive use often have cylinder or improved cylinder chokes for the widest shot pattern at typically short defensive ranges. The choke should be tailored to the range and size of the targets. A skeet shooter shooting at close targets might use of constriction to produce a diameter pattern at a distance of . A trap shooter shooting at distant targets might use of constriction to produce a diameter pattern at . Special chokes for turkey hunting, which requires long range shots at the small head and neck of the bird, can go as high as . The use of too much choke and a small pattern increases the difficulty of hitting the target; the use of too little choke produces large patterns with insufficient pellet density to reliably break targets or kill game. \"Cylinder barrels\" have no constriction.\n\nThe invention of choke boring is usually attributed to American gunsmiths. Mr. J.W. Long, in his book \"American Wildfowling\", credits a Mr. Jeremiah Smith of Southfield, Rhode Island, as the gunsmith who first discovered the concept, as far back as 1827.\n\nThe first known patents for choke boring were granted Sylvester H. Roper, an American inventor and gunsmith. This was followed by a patent claim in London by W.R. Pape, an English gun maker, whose patent application was six weeks too late to the 1866 Roper patent. \n\nWhile American gunsmiths were the pioneers of the choke boring system, they had not really progressed beyond the elementary stage and their choked shotguns would lead, throw irregular patterns, and not shoot straight.\n\nW. W. Greener's first intimation of the choke formation was derived from instructions given in a customer's letter, in early 1874. The customer's instructions described a choke, but did not give any details on the size or shape, or how it was to be obtained. Hence, Greener had to conduct many experiments to determine the perfect shape and size of a choke for a given bore. After that, he developed tools to produce the choke bore profile correctly and smoothly. The system of choke boring that he pioneered was so successful that it was later adopted by other manufacturers and hence, some authorities give him the credit for inventing the concept, since his method became the first repeatable method of choke boring. William Wellington Greener is thus widely credited as being the inventor of the first practical choke, as documented in his classic 1888 publication, \"The Gun and its Development\". \n\nIn December 1874, the first mention of Greener's choke bore appeared in an article by J.H. Walsh, the editor of \"Field\" magazine. The article mentioned the extraordinary shot pattern that the Greener shotgun could produce. The next issue came with an advertisement from Greener, stating that the firm would guarantee that their new guns would shoot a closer pattern than any other manufacturer. The advertisement claimed that Greener 12 bores were warranted to shoot an average pattern of 210, when the best 12 bore gun in the London Gun Trial of 1866 could only average 127. Naturally, the advertisement generated considerable controversy, especially from rival manufacturers of cylinder guns, who refused to believe the numbers quoted in the advertisement.\n\nTo resolve the controversy, the editors of \"Field\" magazine decided to conduct a public trial in 1875. The London Trial of 1875 pitted choke bores and cylinder guns of various manufacturers in four categories—Class 1 (large bores, any boring), Class 2 (choke bores, 12 gauge), Class 3 (guns of English boring or cylinders) and Class 4 (small gauges, any boring). The choke bored guns performed better than the cylinder guns in all these tests, and W.W. Greener choke bore guns won the class 1, class 2 and class 4 categories. Greener Choke bores also won at the London Gun Trials of 1877 and 1879, and the Chicago Field Gun Trial of 1879. The results of these trials were responsible for making the W.W. Greener name famous, and for confirming the practical advantage of a repeatable method of controlling the performance of a choke on a shotgun.\n\nThe exit end of a choke is smaller by some dimension than the actual bore of the barrel. This difference in diameter is the amount of constriction. For example, for a 12 gauge, the bore diameter of the barrel is nominally , although different manufacturers do vary their as-manufactured bore from this diameter slightly. This is commonly called \"overbore\", when the as-built diameter exceeds the nominal actual diameter of . The advantages touted for \"overbore\" are a perceived reduction in recoil, and a lessened shot deformation for improving shot patterns.\n\nGenerally the constriction ranges for chokes will be 0.00-1.15 mm (0.00-0.045 inch) while the constriction for relatively common turkey chokes may be as much as 2.50 mm (0.10 inch). Choke is measured experimentally by observing the percentage of pellets in a charge that impact inside a 75 cm circle at 35 m (25 m for \"cylinder\" and \"Skeet1\"). Although different choke manufacturers have different identification of their chokes, the notches in the chart below are generally accepted.\n\nA common method of expressing the amount of constriction is by \"points\". A \"point\" is equivalent to of constriction of the inner diameter of a choke. Hence, 40 points of constriction would correspond to a constriction of 0.040 inch (≈ 1 mm) in the inner diameter of a choke, corresponding to \"Extra Full\".\n\nThe marking is usually stamped on the underside of the barrel for older guns without choke tubes, or is spelled out in abbreviated text on the barrel near the gauge marking.\n\nIn the case of choke tubes, the amount of choke for each barrel is usually stamped on the side of the choke tube, or there may be thin slots cut in the exposed rim of the tube at the barrel opening with the number of slots corresponding to the number of *'s in this table. (The 4 wider slots present in the exposed rim of the tube are intended for use with a choke wrench, in the event a choke tube ever becomes stuck in the barrel, and have no relationship to the amount of choke.)\n\nFor the case of older, side-by-side, Spanish guns, the choke is often marked on the tang of the barrels, becoming exposed when the wooden forearm is removed, after the double barrels are pivoted off of the break-action, such as when performing a field-stripping and cleaning. The manufacturer's mark, along with the proof marks, and the weight of the barrels in grams, and the proof test pressures are also stamped alongside the choke marking on the tang of the barrels, near where the shells are inserted into the barrels.\n\nIn practice, choke tubes tighter than \"Full\", such as \"Turkey\", are also commonly marked with but a single thin notch on the end of the tube. Hence, to distinguish between \"Full\" vs. even tighter chokes, such as \"Turkey\", it becomes necessary to measure the bore exit diameter of the choke tube to determine precisely which choke type is present among the \"Full\" and tighter (smaller diameter) chokes.\n\nOther specialized choke tubes exist as well. Some turkey hunting tubes have constrictions greater than \"Turkey\", or additional features like porting to reduce recoil, or \"straight rifling\" that is designed to stop any spin that the shot column might acquire when traveling down the barrel. These tubes are often extended tubes, meaning they project beyond the end of the bore, giving more room for things like a longer conical section. Shot spreaders or diffusion chokes work opposite of normal chokes—they are designed to spread the shot more than a cylinder bore, generating wider patterns for very short range use. A basic spreader choke is simply a \"choke\" with a larger diameter than the barrel; the spreader choke still makes the barrel more restrictive than just having a shorter barrel, but a shorter barrel may not be allowed due to legal restrictions. A number of recent spreader chokes, such as the Briley \"Diffusion\" line, actually use rifling in the choke to spin the shot slightly, creating a wider spread. The Briley Diffusion uses a 1 in 36 cm twist, as does the FABARM Lion Paradox shotgun.\n\nOval chokes, which are designed to provide a shot pattern wider than it is tall, are sometimes found on combat shotguns, primarily those of the Vietnam War era. They were available for aftermarket addition in the 1970s from companies like A & W Engineering. Military versions of the Ithaca 37 with \"duckbill\" choke were used in limited numbers during the Vietnam War by US Navy Seals. It arguably increased effectiveness in close range engagements against multiple targets. Two major disadvantages plagued the system. One was erratic patterning. The second was that the shot would spread too quickly providing a very limited effective zone.\n\nOffset chokes, where the pattern is intentionally slightly off of center, are used to change the point of impact. For instance, an offset choke can be used to make a double barrelled shotgun with poorly aligned barrels hit the same spot with both barrels.\n\nFor shotguns with fixed chokes integral to the barrel, it is sometimes still possible to change the choke to a tighter choke. This is done by increasing the diameter of the bore inside the barrel for a short length of barrel, while the portion of the barrel and bore nearest the muzzle is left as it was. The effect is to form what is called a \"jug choke\" or a \"reverse choke\". This method is sometimes used by gunsmiths to implement a tighter choke on an existing gun without replaceable chokes, and can be done without requiring replacement of a barrel and without installing new screw-in replaceable chokes. Advantages claimed for a \"jug choke\" include improved patterns, reduction of recoil, and an increase of choke in a shotgun that does not have replaceable choke tubes. When a \"jug choke\" is implemented in an existing choked barrel, the bore inside the bored-out section of barrel effectively becomes \"overbored\", and this also typically lessens the amount of shot deformation, thereby increasing the shot pattern density.\n\nThe following list should only be used as a guide, and there may be exceptions.\n\nOlder shotgun barrels and chokes were designed for use with lead shot only. Due to changing worldwide waterfowl hunting law restrictions, the use of lead shot has been banned in many parts of the world by international agreement. The reason is that waterfowl hunting with lead shot was identified as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where lead shot collects. In the United States, UK, Canada, and many western European countries (France as of 2006), all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead. One method commonly used to work around this legislative change, at least for hunters with newer shotguns with chokes designed for steel shot, is to use steel shot, but the use of steel shot may damage chokes on older firearms that were designed for use with lead shot only such as Damascus-barreled shotguns. Most non-toxic shot shells produce higher chamber pressures than lead shot and can severely damage these older shotguns and as a rule of thumb, use a more open choke than you would for lead shells. An example would be an improved cylinder choke will perform like a modified choke when shooting steel or tungsten shells. For such hunters, wishing to continue to use older shotguns with chokes not rated for use with steel shot, the use of bismuth shotshells in the place of lead shotshells is common. Other alternatives to lead shotshells than bismuth also exist that are legal for hunting waterfowl, and which are safe for use with older chokes. Within recent years, several companies have created \"heavier than lead\" non-toxic shot out of tungsten, bismuth, or other elements with a density similar to or greater than lead, and with a shot softness comparable to lead. These shells provide more consistent patterns than steel shot and provide greater range than steel shot. They are also generally safe to use in older shotguns with barrels and chokes not rated for use with steel shot, such as for bismuth and tungsten-polymer (although not tungsten-iron) shot. The increase in performance of \"heavier than lead\" non-toxic shot comes at a higher cost. Boxes of such non-toxic shotshells can cost upwards of $40 (2013) a box for twenty five shells, compared with less than $8 per box (2013) for lead pellet shotshells.\n\nIn practice, steel shot patterns as much as two chokes tighter for a given amount of constriction. In other words, a choke that patterns \"Modified\" with lead or bismuth shot would give a \"Full\" pattern with steel shot. To avoid excessive wear or grooving from occurring within chokes when shooting steel shot, many manufacturers recommend avoiding shooting steel shot in any chokes marked tighter than \"Modified\", unless the choke tube is specifically marked as being safe for use with steel shot.\n\n"}

Because epileptic seizures typically include convulsions, the term \"convulsion\" is sometimes used as a synonym for \"seizure\". However, not all epileptic seizures lead to convulsions, and not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures. Convulsions are also consistent with an electric shock and improper enriched air scuba diving. For non-epileptic convulsions, see non-epileptic seizures.\n\nThe word \"fit\" is sometimes used to mean a convulsion or epileptic seizure.\n\nWhen a person is having a convulsion, they may experience several different symptoms. These may include: a brief blackout, confusion, drooling, loss of bowel/bladder control, sudden shaking of entire body, uncontrollable muscle spasms, temporary cessation of breathing, and many more. Symptoms usually last from a few seconds to around 15 minutes. If someone has a fit like this, it is advised to make sure they don't fall and injure themselves, cushion their head and loosen any restricting clothing/jewelry, and also call for medical help. Do not try to pin/hold them in place, as this could possibly cause harm or injury to the individual. Do not place anything between the person's teeth during a seizure (including your fingers).\n\nThe most common type of seizure is called a generalized seizure, also known as a generalized convulsion. This is characterized by a loss of consciousness which may lead to the person collapsing. The body stiffens for about a minute and then jerks uncontrollably for the next minute. During this, the patient may fall and injure themselves or bite their tongue and lose control of their bladder. A familial history of this puts a person at a greater risk for developing them.\n\nConvulsions are often the result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The specific cause is often not clear. Convulsions can be caused by specific chemicals in the blood, as well as infections like meningitis or encephalitis. A common cause in children is febrile seizures. Other possibilities include celiac disease, head trauma, stroke or lack of oxygen to the brain. Sometimes the convulsion can be caused by genetic defects or brain tumors. Convulsions can also occur when the blood sugar is too low and deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine).\nIn Nigeria, Malaria, is a very important cause of Convulsions among children under 5 years of age.\n"}

The designs used the same portrait as the Wildings, but were specially designed to incorporate the symbols of each of the home nations and Crown dependencies.\n\nNorthern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Isle of Man regional stamps were changed to the Machins on decimalisation, with the relevant emblems shown in the top left hand corner. They were replaced between 1999 and 2000 with new designs for the four home nations.\n\nWhile generally sold at post offices in their respective areas, all were valid throughout the UK and, until they became postally independent, the Crown Dependencies.\n\nThe idea of regional stamps came up after World War II to help the tourism in the Channel Islands, which were occupied by German forces until the end of the conflict. The concept was extended to all United Kingdom's regions and essays were prepared: positions of King George VI's head and symbols.\n\nSpecial committees were established to choose the heraldic emblems or symbols for the each country or island. These are discussed in the sections below. The first value (3d deep lilac) of the regional issues were introduced on 18 August 1958 in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The design consisted of the Dorothy Wilding's portrait of the Queen surrounded by appropriate regional symbols. Other values were introduced at later dates. Some of the issue dates are unclear, as the stamps were first issued at the Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh, others first at the Philatelic Counter in London, yet others first in the region.\n\nThe colours used were consistent across the various regions, and stayed constant with the exception of the 4d value, which was issued in three different colours – initially ultramarine, then olive-sepia and finally vermilion. The 4d's initial colour change was made to bring it into line with that used by the newly issued pre-decimal Machin series (from 5 June 1967 onwards). The Machin 4d's colour was then changed because of complaints that the date of postmarks (critical for football pool entries) could not be read on so dark a colour. All the regional 4d's were then changed again to the new Machin colour of vermilion.\n\nThe Scottish Committee chose designs by John B. Fleming, Gordon F. Huntly and Archie B. Imrie.\n\nThe symbols selected by the Welsh committee were a Welsh Dragon (\"passant\") and the leek. Three designs by Reynolds Stone were chosen.\n\nThere were perceived to be some particular problems creating the Northern Ireland definitives because of a lack of symbols that might be used to represent Northern Ireland while avoiding contentious political symbolism. The committee charged with organising the choice of design decided on Dorothy Wilding's portrait of the Queen augmented with symbols: the Red Hand of Ulster (the emblem of the O’Neills – the royal house of Ulster); the Arms of Northern Ireland \"(without supporters)\"; the six-pointed Crowned Star with the Red Hand; the Flax Plant (with or without leaves); and a Field Gate with \"Ulster\" pillars. Several local artists were chosen to present designs and one from each was chosen by the Queen. The artists were: Thomas Collins; Leonard Pilton; William Hollywood; Colin Middleton; Miss T. Robinson. Three, Collins; Pilton and Hollywood were chosen to be issued.\n\n1958 Queen Elizabeth II Northern Ireland \"Wilding\" issue\nEric Piprell designed the Guernsey stamps. These show the Crown of William the Conqueror and the Guernsey lily as described in the book The Lilium Sarniense by James Douglas published in 1975. He also designed the d, which showed a variation of the Lily and Crown theme. The Jersey stamps were designed by William Gardner, with the exception of the d issue which was designed by Edmund Blampied. The Gardner design showed the Mace presented to the island by Charles II in 1663 and the Arms of Jersey as the main subjects with a potato and tomato plant in the borders to emphasise the importance of agriculture. The Blampied design also used the Mace and Arms, but in different positions and omitted the plants. Source: Channel Islands Stamps and Postal History, published by Stanley Gibbons in 1979.\n\nJersey and Guernsey became postally independent on 1 October 1969 when they each issued their own inaugural series.\nThe Isle of Man stamps were designed by John Nicholson, included the \"tre cassyn\" (Three Legs) escutcheoned (on a shield), the three spurs looking rather like stars, and had a bordering ring-chain pattern based on designs on ancient Manx stone crosses.\n\nOn 7 July 1971 the previous Wilding based designs for the Isle of Man, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were replaced with designs similar to the standard British Machin portrait definitives. Each stamp had a reduced size portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin with a national emblem in the top left corner, the latter designed by Jeffery Matthews. The emblems used were :\n\nThe colours of the Machin regionals were the same as those of the main Machin issues. There are a few exceptions, for example the 4½p regionals are a darker blue. Not all the values and colours of the main issue appear in the regionals, but as these designs remained in use in the other regions for the rest of the 20th century, a large number of values were issued.\n\nThe Isle of Man became postally autonomous on 5 July 1973 and only four Machin values were therefore ever issued for this region:\n\nIn the late 1990s, new designs were produced for each of the 4 British home nations including (for the first time ever) England. Four values were issued for each nation, firstly Scotland and Wales on 8 June 1999, Northern Ireland on 6 March 2001 and finally, England on 23 April 2001, each showing heraldic and other symbols of the relevant country. These were initially borderless (full-bleed), but in 2003 these were replaced with stamps having white borders. As postal rates have changed, so have the values denominated on some of the stamps. The '2nd' and '1st' values have remained constant, but the 'E' value reverted to 40p initially, and then increased to 42p, 44p, 48p, 50p and 56p. The 64p and 65p values have been reissued as 68p, 72p, 78p, 81p, 90p and 97p values.\n\n\n"}

Despite business field, data culture are also applied in the social infrastructure system, such as urban planning projects, in order to impact the process of data production and data practices of daily usage, such as Smart City programs. In general, to build data culture, the departments and organizations have to let the data talk itself, and trust the steering of statistics. Being successful as a data-driven entity requires the active participation of all staffs involved in an organization, therefore open access to data is significant in the process.\n\nThe idea of data culture has been under the spotlight of business field since the beginning of the 21st century, and is gaining popularity in recent years. Although first introduced in a scientific approach, the idea is now associated with both the science field and social sectors.\n\nParticipants are both producers of data and people who can contribute to the data culture by making influential changes. In the building process of data culture in a particular entity, employees at different levels are all supposed to obtain the ability of illustrating their works with relative statistics. This includes but is not limited to the goal of their job, the purpose of a specific task, and solutions they could bring up according to problems pointed out by data. Also, participants are allowed to make decisions within the section they take charge of, and experience changes happened due to their innovations.\n\nData analysts serve as an important part in the establishment of a data culture, as they often receive first-hand material and raw data, and the way they connect all the components together can determine the efficiency of communication between ordinary participants and decision-makers. Also, they are responsible for the analysis of information conveyed by the data. Having data scientists in each specific section of a company would be an ideal situation for a data-driven entity, therefore guaranteeing data access whenever needed.\n\nDecision-makers are those who apply changes and determine the direction of development in a company. In this case, they would make important decisions according to the trends and information highlighted by the data produced either in their own companies internally or statistics of the target market they want their corporations to aim at. Also, to build a data culture, decision makers have to emphasize their intention of requiring data analyses, therefore driving the motivation of staffs to deal with raw materials. \n\nThe Microsoft team, under the management of Satya Nadella, depends on data to drive both major market decisions and their daily behaviors. Microsoft focuses on data visualization and advocates that participants and employees should have the right to access the company's data. The company uses tools such as Power BI in order to have individual workers get involved and contribute to the future of the company.\n\nCapita is a British agency that assists clients in both government departments and enterprises to understand themselves better, using advanced techniques of data analysis. Established in 1984, they advocate their clients to build their own data culture with relative database in their own field of career.\n\nSocrata is a US-based company which serves both public sectors and the civil society. They assist companies and organizations reach open data from the federal government in order to either improve the working progress of the government or assist social groups that are lack of resources. Their core value is tied to open data and they tend to focus on corporations which are in need of funding in order to process data analysis. The cloud-based service they provide allow government departments to communicate with the public through publishing their official data.\n\nSome companies feel that it is important to keep the data private at the executive level. Although it is possible for all staff in a company to produce and process the data together, it is restricted for data to be free from the approach of participants at the elementary level. Some companies use the idea of Data Warehouse, a system that limits access to data. Only people in charge could access the data, and other people requiring access need to go through the assessment of warehouse staff.\n\nAs long as data bureaucracy is convenient for open access to databases, the large number of users might slow down the speed of processing in a particular system. Also, it might be difficult for users to search for what they want if the data bureaucracy system is not facilitated with proper tools. In this case, Data Warehouse would be more efficient for users who are not able to perform professionally when they seek for data.\n\nA rational method of building or expanding an enterprise is an opposite approach to an empirical one. The decisions of rationalists are often evaluated according to their personal spirit and their existing cognition of the world. In terms of this approach, decision-makers depend on logic rather than social phenomena and phenomena appearing at the front line of an industry to make changes. The fact that decision-making process is not limited to the executive team anymore lead to the hesitation of some people on the management level, therefore they refuse to develop data culture.\n\n"}
{"id": "546013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=546013", "title": "Decorum", "text": "Decorum\n\nDecorum (from the Latin: \"right, proper\") was a principle of classical rhetoric, poetry and theatrical theory that was about the fitness or otherwise of a style to a theatrical subject. The concept of decorum is also applied to prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within set situations.\n\nIn classical rhetoric and poetic theory, decorum designates the appropriateness of style to subject. Both Aristotle (in, for example, his \"Poetics\") and Horace (in his \"Ars Poetica\") discussed the importance of appropriate style in epic, tragedy, comedy, etc. Horace says, for example: \"A comic subject is not susceptible of treatment in a tragic style, and similarly the banquet of Thyestes cannot be fitly described in the strains of everyday life or in those that approach the tone of comedy. Let each of these styles be kept to the role properly allotted to it.\"\n\nHellenistic and Latin rhetors divided style into: the grand style, the middle style and the low (or plain) style; certain types of vocabulary and diction were considered appropriate for each stylistic level. A discussion of this division of styles was set out in the pseudo-Ciceronian \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\". Modeled on Virgil's three-part literary career (\"Bucolics\", \"Georgics\", \"Aeneid\"), ancient, medieval and Renaissance theorists often linked each style to a specific genre: epic (high style), didactic (middle style) and pastoral (plain style). In the Middle Ages, this concept was called \"Virgil's wheel\". For stylistic purists, the mixing of styles within a work was considered inappropriate, and a consistent use of the high style was mandated for the epic. However, stylistic diversity had been a hallmark of classical epic (as seen in the inclusion of comic and/or erotic scenes in the epics of Virgil or Homer).\nPoetry, perhaps more than any other literary form, usually expressed words or phrases that were not current in ordinary conversation, characterized as poetic diction.\n\nWith the arrival of Christianity, concepts of decorum became involved with those of the sacred and profane in a different way from in the previous classical religions. Although in the Middle Ages religious subjects were often treated with broad humour in a \"low\" manner, especially in medieval drama, the churches policed carefully the treatment in more permanent art forms, insisting on a consistent \"high style\". By the Renaissance the mixture of revived classical mythology and Christian subjects was also considered to fall under the heading of decorum, as was the increasing habit of mixing religious subjects in art with lively genre painting or portraiture of the fashionable. The Catholic Council of Trent specifically forbade, among other things, the \"indecorous\" in religious art.\n\nConcepts of decorum, increasingly sensed as inhibitive and stultifying, were aggressively attacked and deconstructed by writers of the Modernist movement, with the result that readers' expectations were no longer based on decorum, and in consequence the violations of decorum that underlie the wit of mock-heroic, of literary burlesque, and even a sense of bathos, were dulled in the twentieth-century reader.\n\nIn continental European debates on theatre in the Renaissance and post-Renaissance, decorum is concerned with the appropriateness of certain actions or events to the stage. In their emulation of classical models and of the theoretical works by Aristotle and Horace (including the notion of the \"Three Unities\"), certain subjects were deemed to be better left to narration. In Horace's \"Ars Poetica\", the poet (in addition to speaking about appropriate vocabulary and diction, as discussed above) counseled playwrights to respect decorum by avoiding the portrayal, on stage, of scenes that would shock the audience by their cruelty or unbelievable nature: \"But you will not bring on to the stage anything that ought properly to be taking place behinds the scenes, and you will keep out of sight many episodes that are to be described later by the eloquent tongue of a narrator. Medea must not butcher her children in the presence of the audience, nor the monstrous Atreus cook his dish of human flesh within public view, nor Procne be metamorphosed into a bird, nor Cadmus into a snake. I shall turn in disgust from anything of this kind that you show me. \"\n\nIn Renaissance Italy, important debates on decorum in theater were set off by Sperone Speroni's play \"Canace\" (portraying incest between a brother and sister) and Giovanni Battista Giraldi's play \"Orbecche\" (involving patricide and cruel scenes of vengeance). In seventeenth-century France, the notion of decorum (\"les bienséances\") was a key component of French classicism in both theater and the novel (see French literature of the 17th century), as well as the visual arts - see hierarchy of genres.\n\n\"Social\" decorum sets down appropriate social behavior and propriety, and is thus linked to notions of etiquette and manners.\n\nThe precepts of social decorum as we understand them, of the preservation of external decency, were consciously set by Lord Chesterfield, who was looking for a translation of \"les moeurs\": \"Manners are too little, morals are too much.\" The word decorum survives in Chesterfield's severely reduced form as an element of etiquette: the prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within a set situation. The use of this word in this sense is of the sixteenth-century, prescribing the boundaries established in drama and literature, used by Roger Ascham, \"The Scholemaster\" (1570) and echoed in Malvolio's tirade in \"Twelfth Night\", \"My masters, are you mad, or what are you? Have you no wit, manners nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?...Is there no respect of persons, place nor time in you?\"\n\nThe place of decorum in the courtroom, of the type of argument that is within bounds, remains pertinent: the decorum of argument was a constant topic during the O.J. Simpson trial.\n\nDuring Model United Nations conferences the honorable chair may have to announce, \"Decorum delegates!\" if delegates are not adhering to parliamentary procedure dictated by the rules. This often happens if a delegate speaks out of turn or if the delegation is being disruptive.\n\n\n"}

Gradation causes consonants in a word to alternate between two \"grades\", termed \"strong\" and \"weak\", depending on the grammar. Some grammatical forms trigger the weak grade, while others have the strong grade. It is not predictable which form will have which grade; this must simply be memorised. Not all words show gradation. In particular, words with stems of three or more syllables generally do not gradate, nor do words with stems of one syllable.\n\nGradation correlates with the appearance of extra length on a syllable. When a syllable is long, the strong grade will always be accompanied by extra length. The weak grade may or may not have extra length, depending on other factors. These are mentioned at Estonian phonology - Suprasegmental length. Some words show gradation only through the presence of absence or extra length, and the consonants themselves do not change. In this article, extra length is shown with a backtick ` before the vowel of the syllable.\n\nThe gradation patterns of geminate (long) consonants are relatively simple:\n\nPatterns for single plosives are more varied and unpredictable. The weak grade may involve disappearance of the consonant altogether, with further consequences for vowels and extra length.\n\nThere are also four special assimilative patterns:\n\nWhen a consonant is reduced to zero in the weak grade, this may cause the vowels of the two adjacent syllables to come together. These vowels undergo several changes:\n\nAssibilation is a change that happened in Proto-Finnic: the sequence \"ti\" became \"si\". This change is no longer productive or predictable, but a fair number of nouns still display the effects in certain forms. The effect is visible in that sometimes \"s\" appears where there would otherwise be a \"t\" or \"d\". This also creates new variants of the gradation patterns mentioned above, with \"s\" appearing in some of the forms in both the strong and weak grade.\n\nFor example:\n\nInflectional endings as listed below are added to the stem of a noun, which is formed from:\n\nSingular nominative, singular genitive and singular partitive are not predictable and have to be taken from the vocabulary (gradation may also apply).\n\nSingular genitive always ends in vowel. When formed from a stem that ends in consonant, it can take the following endings: \"-a, -e, -i, -o, -u\".\n\nSingular partitive can take the following endings: \"-d, -t, -a, -e, -i, -u\".\n\nPlural partitive is formed from either singular genitive or singular partitive and can take the following endings (some words have two forms):\n\nSingular illative has a short form in some words. It can take the following endings: \"-de\", \"-he\", \"-hu\", \"-a\", \"-e\", \"-i\", \"-u\". In case it takes the vowel ending, this vowel is the same as the ending vowel of the singular genitive form of the given word, but the vowel (if it is already long or a diphthong) or its preceding consonant (if the vowel is short and the consonant either short or long) is lengthened to the third degree and thus becomes overlong. If illative ends with \"-sesse\", then the short form is \"-sse\".\n\nPlural illative, inessive, elative, allative, adessive, ablative, translative have a short form in some words. If the plural partitive ends with \"-id\", then the short plural stem is this form without \"-d\" (instead of plural genitive with \"-de-\"); if it ends with a vowel, then the short plural stem is this form; if it ends with \"-sid\", then the short plural cannot be formed.\n\nEmphasis: noun + \"-gi\" (after a final voiced consonant or vowel) / \"-ki\" (after a final voiceless consonant).\n\nNew nouns can be derived from existing nouns, adjectives and verbs using suffixes like \"-ja\" (agent, from \"-ma\" infinitive), \"-mine\" (gerund, from \"-ma\" infinitive), \"-la, -nna, -tar, -ur, -stik, -ndik, -nik, -ik, -k, -ng, -lane, -line, -kene, -ke, -e, -ndus, -dus, -us, -is, -kond, -nd, -istu, -u\".\n\n\nThere are traditionally considered to be 14 noun cases in Estonian:\n\nLocative cases make up six or eight of these fourteen (depending on interpretation).\n\nThere are also some additional cases such as the prolative (jalgsi, \"by foot\"; käsitsi, \"by hand\"), or the similarly formed instructive (meritsi, \"by the way of the sea\"), which are not traditionally counted among the 14 grammatical cases.\n\nInflectional endings as listed below are added to the stem of an adjective, which is formed like the one for nouns.\n\nThe stem for the comparative and superlative forms is the singular genitive of an adjective; if a word has two syllables in the genitive or a vowel following \"-ke(se)\", then \"-ke(se)\" is left out and the last vowel in the stem changes to \"-e\". The genitive and the partitive of the comparative itself are formed with \"-a\" and \"-at\".\n\nNew adjectives can be derived from existing words by means of suffixes like:<br>\n\nAntonym can be formed by prepending \"eba\" or \"mitte\" to an adjective. \"Eba-\" is considered to be the only derivational prefix in Estonian; as \"mitte\" can also occur as a separate word, \"mitte\" + adjective can be regarded as a compound rather than derivative. Alternatively, for an adjective formed from a noun or a verb, an antonym can often be constructed using the suffix \"-tu\" or \"-matu\".\n\n\nThe following lists are not exhaustive.\n\nPostpositions\n\nPrepositions\n\nThe inflectional endings as listed below are added to the stem of a verb, which is formed from:\n\n\"-ma\" infinitive and \"-da\" infinitive are not predictable and have to be taken from the vocabulary. Present tense form and \"-tud\" participle are derived from the infinitives on the basis of gradation.\n\n\"-ma\" infinitive is used after verbs of motion and after participles. It can be declined: \"-ma\" (illative), \"-mas\" (inessive), \"-mast\" (elative), \"-maks\" (translative), \"-mata\" (abessive).\n\n\"-da\" infinitive is used after verbs of emotion, after impersonal expressions, after \"et\" (in order to) and as a subject. It can be declined: \"-des\" (inessive).\n\nVerb derivation: \"-ta-\" (transitive/passive), \"-u- / -i-\" (reflexive), \"-el- / -le-\" (reciprocal), \"-ne-\" (translative), \"-ata-\" (momentane), \"-el- / -skle-\" (frequentative), \"-tse-\" (continuous).\n\nEmphasis: verb + \"-gi\" (after a final voiced consonant or vowel) / \"-ki\" (after a final voiceless consonant), verb + \"küll\" (positive), verb + \"mitte\" (negative).\n\nInflectional endings as listed below are added to the stem of an adverb, which is formed from:\n\nSome adverbs are special words - original or vestigial forms of an ancient instructive case.\n\nPro-adverbs\n\nThe neutral word order in Estonian is subject–verb–object (SVO). Conjunctions: \"aga\" (but), \"et\" (that), \"ja\" (and), \"kas\" (whether), \"kui\" (if), \"nagu\" (as), \"sest\" (because), \"või\" (or). Questions begin with an interrogative word (interrogative pro-forms or \"kas\" (yes/no-question), \"eks\" (yes-question), \"ega\" (no-question)), followed by the SVO word order (in spoken language, interrogative words are sometimes left out, but instead there is either a change in intonation or VSO word order); answers: \"jah/jaa\" (yes), \"ei\" (no). An adjective precedes the noun it modifies. An adverb of time precedes an adverb of place.\n\nHowever, as one would expect from an agglutinative language, the word order is quite free and non-neutral word order can be used to stress some parts of the sentence or in poetic text, as in Finnish grammar. For example, consider the sentence \"mees tappis karu\" which means \"(a/the) man killed (a/the) bear\" and uses the neutral SVO word order. The sentence can be rephrased using OVS word order as \"karu tappis mees\" — a normal Estonian sentence that could be more precisely translated as \"it was (a/the) man who killed the bear\", i. e. the sayer emphasizes that the killer was a man, probably assuming the listener knows that a bear was killed. The other four word orders (\"tappis mees karu\", \"tappis karu mees\", \"mees karu tappis\", \"karu mees tappis\") are also possible in certain contexts, especially if more words are added to the three-word sentences.\n\nSometimes the form of the verb, nouns and adjectives in the sentence are not enough to determine the subject and object, e. g. \"mehed tapsid karud\" (\"the men killed the bears\") or \"isa tappis karu\" (\"father killed the bear\") — in the first sentence because in plural, the nominative case is used in Estonian both for subject and telic object, and in the second sentence because in singular, the nominative, genitive and partitive forms of the word \"isa\" are the same, as well as those of the word \"karu\" (unlike the word \"mees\" which has different forms: sg. nom. \"mees\", sg. gen. \"mehe\", sg. part. \"meest\"). In such sentences, word order is the only thing that distinguishes the subject and the object: listener presumes that the former noun (\"mehed\", \"isa\") is the subject and the latter (\"karud\", \"karu\") is the object. In such situations, the sayer cannot interchange the subject and the object for emphasis (at least unless it is obvious from the context which noun is the subject).\n\n"}

As an influential \"gardian\" (a kind of Provençal cowboy), he is an important figure in the traditional lifestyle and culture of the Camargue region of southern France.\n\nThough born in Aix-en-Provence, Falco de Baroncelli-Javon was baptised in Avignon, where his parents lived. He came from a Florentine family who had settled in Provence in the 15th century, occupying a building in the centre of Avignon then called the Baroncelli Palace (now the Palais du Roure). His father's side of the family were of Tuscan origin and part of the Ghibelline tradition, and they were hereditary Marquises of Javon. Though somewhat aristocratic, the family spoke Provençal, which was rather controversial at a time when it was considered to be a language of the common people.\n\nHis brother was Jacques de Baroncelli, later a famous film director, and his sister, Marguerite de Baroncelli-Javon, later became ‘queen’ of the Occitan cultural movement known as the Félibrige, and married the post-impressionist painter Georges Dufrénoy.\n\nIn 1895, \"lou Marquès\" (‘the Marquis’), as he was then known, moved to the Camargue and raised a herd of cattle called the \"Manado sentanco\" (the ‘holy herd’) in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. He married the daughter of a Châteauneuf-du-Pape landowner, and had three daughters, but his wife did not take to the climate of the Camargue and their life together was patchy. Nevertheless, he settled in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer and became a tenant of a \"mas\", or traditional ranch, called the \"Mas de l'Amarée\".\n\nIn 1905, when an American rodeo show visited Nîmes, he met Joe Hammam and then Buffalo Bill. Becoming friendly, he offered the services of his \"gardians\", who took part in Buffalo Bill's cowboys-and-Indians displays.\n\nIn May 1908, he met Jeanne de Flandreysy and fell in love. Their affair was short, but their friendship would remain an important part of Baroncelli's life. After the war, it was she who encouraged him to start writing, and he became an important part of the resurgent Occitan literary movement associated with Frédéric Mistral. Baroncelli was deeply affected by the carnage of the First World War, and became a fervent anti-militarist, later supporting a local Communist mayor.\n\nMost importantly, perhaps, he played an active role in maintaining and fostering a native Camarguais culture. He was involved in codifying the nascent ‘course camarguaise’, or local style of bullfighting, in which the object was to snatch a rose from the bull's head. He put a lot of effort into raising purebred Camargue bulls, and his bull \"Prouvenço\" was a particularly fiercesome and well-known example.\n\nIn 1909 he founded the Nacioun Gardiano (‘\"gardian\" nation’) to preserve the traditions of the Camargue.\n\nIn 1931, out of money, Baroncelli had to leave the \"Mas de l’Amarée\". Locals offered him a patch of land nearby where he constructed a replica of his old ranch, calling it the \"Mas du Simbèu\" (‘sign, emblem’; also the name given to the chief bull of a herd). Among other things, he became an important supporter of the Romany people in this area, and counted many gypsies among his close friends.\n\nThe late 1930s were marked by a series of illnesses, and the outbreak of the Second World War would prove too disruptive for him. His ranch was requisitioned by German troops in 1943, and the Marquis was evicted to Saintes-Maries. Sick and disoriented, he finally died at Avignon in December 1943.\n\nThe image which many in France have of the Camargue is essentially of the traditions and customs which Baroncelli worked for his whole life. As a working \"gardian\", he was intimately involved with the Camargue horses and Camargue bulls which are emblematic of the region. And he also left an important body of writing describing the area, including Camarguais folktales published in the local dialect of Occitan. His writing and his work helped to give the area a sense of individual importance which it has maintained to this day.\n\n\n"}

It is often considered a dialect of southern Corsican, or even a transitional language between Corsican and Sardinian.\n\nGallurese's morphology and vocabulary are close to those of Corsican, in particular with the southern dialects of Sartene and Porto-Vecchio, whereas its phonology and syntax are similar to those of Sardinian. One third of Gallurese vocabulary is also influenced by Logudorese Sardinian, Catalan, and Spanish.\n\nThe Sassarese language, spoken in the area of Sassari, shares similar transitional traits between Tuscan, Corsican and Sardinian.\n\n\nGallurese is classified by some linguists as a dialect of Corsican, and by others as a dialect of Sardinian. In any case, a great deal of similarity exists between Southern Corsican dialects and Gallurese, while there is relatively more distance from the neighbouring Sardinian varieties.\n\nThe Regional Government of Sardinia has recognized Gallurese, along with Sassarese as separate languages, distinct from Sardinian.\n\nAn excerpt from a hymn dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe most ancient literary sources in Gallurese date back to the early 17th century, mainly as poetry and religious odes. Some late Middle Age fragments suggest that the formation of the language could be dated to the early 15th century. The origin and the development of Gallurese are debated. Max Leopold Wagner and Maurice Le Lannou argued that successive migration waves from Southern Corsica, promoted under the Aragonese rule to repopulate an area devastated by famine and pandemics, were crucial in the formation of a slightly hybridized version of Corsican.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5280013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5280013", "title": "Garo language", "text": "Garo language\n\nGaro, or A·chik (the name in Garo), is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken in India in the Garo Hills districts of Meghalaya, some parts of Assam, and in small pockets in Tripura. It is also spoken in certain areas of the neighbouring Bangladesh. According to the 2001 census, there are about 889,000 Garo speakers in India alone; another 130,000 are found in Bangladesh.\n\n\"Ethnologue\" lists the following locations for Garo.\n\n\nGaro belongs to the Bodo-Garo subgroup of the Sino-Tibetan, which includes Sinitic languages like Mandarin and Cantonese. The Bodo-Garo subgroup is one of the longest recognised and most coherent subgroups of the Sino-Tibetan language family. This includes languages such as Bodo, Kokborok, Tiwa, Deuri, Garo, Rabha, Atong, Ruga, and Koch. Being closely related to each other, these languages have many features in common; and one can easily recognise the similarities even from a surface-level observation of a given data of words from these languages.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the American Baptist missionaries put the north-eastern dialect of Garo called A·we into writing, initially using the Bengali script. The reason for its selection out of many others was because the north-eastern region of Garo Hills was where rapid growth in the number of educated Garo people was taking place. Besides, the region was also where education was first imparted to the Garos. In course of time, the dialect became associated with educated culture. Today, a variant of the dialect can be heard among the speakers of Tura, a small town in the west-central part of Garo Hills, which is actually an Am·beng-speaking region. But with the migration of educated north-easterners to Tura due to the establishment of the political headquarters there, after Garo Hills came under the complete control of the British Government in 1873, the town saw a shift from its use of the native dialect to the dialect of the north-easterners. Tura also became the educational hub of Garo Hills, and in time a de facto standard developed from the north-eastern dialect (A·we) which gradually became associated with the town and the educated Garo speech everywhere ever since. As regards Garo orthography, basic Latin alphabet completely replaced the Bengali script only by 1924, although a Latin-based alphabet had already been developed by the American missionaries in 1902. The Latin-based Garo alphabet used today consists of 20 letters and a raised dot called \"raka\" (a symbol representing the glottal stop); the letters \"f”, \"q”, \"v”, \"x”, \"y”, and \"z” appear only in imported words. In Bangladesh, a variant of the Bengali script is still used alongside its Latin counterpart. Bengali and Assamese had been the mediums of instruction in educational institutions until 1924, and they have played a great role in the evolution of the modern Garo as we know it today. As a result, many Bengali and Assamese words entered the Garo lexicon. Since recently, there has also been a proliferation of English words entering the everyday Garo speech owing to media and the preference of English-medium schools over those conducted in the vernacular. Hindi is also making a slow but firm appearance in the language.\n\nHere, the term 'dialect' is politically defined as a 'non-official speech variety'. The Garo language comprises dialects such as A·we, Am·beng/A·beng, Matchi, Dual, Chisak, Ganching, and a few others. Marak (2013:134–135) lists the following dialects of Garo and their geographical distributions.\n\n\nThe speakers of these dialects can generally understand one another, although there are occasions where one who is unfamiliar with a dialect from another region requires explanation of certain words and expressions typical of that dialect. Research on the dialects of Garo, with the exception of A·we and Am·beng, is very much neglected; and many Garo dialects are being subsumed either the Standard or A·we or Am·beng. Although the de facto written and spoken standard grew out of A·we, they are not one and the same; there is marked variation in the intonation and the use of vocabulary between the two. It would be proper, therefore, to make a distinction between Standard A·we (spoken mainly in Tura) and Traditional A·we (still heard among the speakers in the north-eastern region of Garo Hills). There is also a great misconception among Garos regarding Atong, Ruga, and Me·gam. These languages are traditionally considered dialects of Garo. The speakers of Atong and Ruga languages are indeed Garos, ethnically; but their languages lack mutual intelligibility with the dialects of Garo and therefore linguistically distinct from the Garo language. Me∙gam (known to the Khasis as Lyngam/Lyngngam) is an Austroasiatic language closely related to Khasi. Since the Me∙gam speakers share a lot in common with the Garos culturally, the Garos misunderstand their language to be another dialect of their own.\n\nGaro has been given the status of an associate official language (the main official being English) in the five Garo Hills districts of Meghalaya under the Meghalaya State Language Act, 2005.\n\nThe language is also used as the medium of instruction at the elementary stage in Government-run schools in the Garo Hills. Even at the secondary stage, in some schools, where English is the de jure medium of instruction, Garo is used alongside English – and sometimes even more than it – making the system more or less a bilingual one. In schools where English is the sole medium, Garo is taught only as a subject, as Modern Indian Language (M.I.L.). At the college level, students can opt for Garo Second Language (G.S.L.) besides the compulsory M.I.L. and even work towards a B.A. (Honours) in Garo.\n\nIn 1996, at the inception of its Tura campus, the North-Eastern Hill University established the Department of Garo, making it one of the first departments to be opened in the campus and \"the only one of its kind in the world\". The department offers M.A. and PhD programs in Garo.\n\nGaro has been witnessing an immense growth in its printed literature lately. There has been an increase in the production of learning materials such as dictionaries, grammar and other text books, translated materials, newspapers, magazines and journals, novels, collection of short stories, folklores and myths, scholarly materials, and many important religious publications such as the Garo bible and the Garo hymnal. However, further research on the language itself has been slow – rather rare − but not non-existent.\n\nWhile almost all other languages in the Bodo–Garo sub-family contrast between low and high tones, Garo is one of the sole exceptions. Wood writes that instead Garo seems to have substituted the tonal system by instead contrasting between syllables that end in a glottal stop and those that do not, with the glottal stop replacing the low tone.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14317", "title": "Hergé", "text": "Hergé\n\nGeorges Prosper Remi (; 22 May 1907 – 3 March 1983), known by the pen name Hergé (; ), was a Belgian cartoonist. He is best known for creating \"The Adventures of Tintin\", the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, \"Quick & Flupke\" (1930–40) and \"The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko\" (1936–57). His works were executed in his distinct \"ligne claire\" drawing style.\n\nBorn to a lower middle-class family in Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by contributing illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, \"The Adventures of Totor\", for \"Le Boy-Scout Belge\" in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper \"Le Vingtième Siècle\", he created \"The Adventures of Tintin\" in 1929 on the advice of its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early installments – \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\", \"Tintin in the Congo\", and \"Tintin in America\" – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the \"Quick & Flupke\" and \"Jo, Zette and Jocko\" series for \"Le Vingtième Siècle\". Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from \"The Blue Lotus\" onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, \"Le Vingtième Siècle\" was closed but Hergé continued his series in \"Le Soir\", a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.\n\nAfter the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, \"Le Soir\" was shut down and its staff – including Hergé – accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and while no charges were brought against Hergé, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With Raymond Leblanc he established \"Tintin\" magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new \"Adventures of Tintin\" stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as Edgar P. Jacobs' \"Blake and Mortimer\". In 1950 he established Studios Hergé as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members Jacques Martin and Bob de Moor greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of \"The Adventures of Tintin\". Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced \"Tintin in Tibet\", his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an abstract artist.\n\nHergé's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe. Widely celebrated in Belgium, a Hergé Museum was established in Louvain-la-Neuve in 2009.\n\nGeorges Prosper Remi was born on 22 May 1907 in his parental home in Etterbeek, Brussels, a central suburb in the capital city of Belgium. His was a lower middle-class family. His Walloon father, Alexis Remi, worked in a confectionery factory, whilst his Flemish mother, Elisabeth Dufour, was a housewife. Married on 18 January 1905, they moved into a house at 25 rue Cranz (now 33 rue Philippe Baucq), where Hergé was born, although a year later they moved to a house at 34 rue de Theux. His primary language was his father's French, but growing up in the bilingual Brussels, he also learned Dutch, developing a Marollien accent from his maternal grandmother. A younger brother, Paul, was born five years after Hergé. Like most Belgians, his family belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, though they were not particularly devout. He later characterised his life in Etterbeek as dominated by a monochrome grey, considering it extremely boring. Biographer Benoît Peeters suggested that this childhood melancholy might have been exacerbated through being sexually abused by a maternal uncle.\n\nRemi developed a love of cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's \"Gertie the Dinosaur\" and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as \"Huckleberry Finn\", \"Treasure Island\", \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"The Pickwick Papers\", as well as the novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the First World War, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.\n\nAged 12, Remi joined the Boy Scout brigade attached to Saint-Boniface School, becoming troop leader of the Squirrel Patrol and earning the name \"Curious Fox\" (\"Renard curieux\"). With the Scouts, he travelled to summer camps in Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Spain, and in the summer of 1923 his troop hiked 200 miles across the Pyrenees. His experiences with Scouting would have a significant influence on the rest of his life, sparking his love of camping and the natural world, and providing him with a moral compass that stressed personal loyalty and keeping one's promises.\n\nHis Scoutmaster, Rene Weverbergh, encouraged his artistic ability, and published one of Remi's drawings in the newsletter of the Saint-Boniface Scouts, \"Jamais Assez\" (\"Never Enough\"): his first published work. When Weverbergh became involved in the publication of \"Boy-Scout\", the newsletter of the Federation of Scouts, he published more of Remi's illustrations, the first of which appeared in the fifth issue, from 1922. Remi continued publishing cartoons, drawings and woodcuts in subsequent issues of the newsletter, which was soon renamed \"Le Boy-Scout Belge\" (\"The Belgian Boy Scout\"). During this time, he experimented with different pseudonyms, using \"Jérémie\" and \"Jérémiades\" before settling on \"Hergé\", the French pronunciation of his reversed initials (R.G.) His work was first published under this name in December 1924.\n\nAlongside his stand-alone illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began production of a comic strip for \"Le Boy-Scout Belge\", \"Les Aventures de Totor\" (\"The Adventures of Totor\"), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in \"Le Blé qui lève\" (\"The Wheat That Grows\") and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, \"The Soul of the Sea\". Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived \"Atelier de la Fleur de Lys\" (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.\n\nAfter graduating from secondary school in 1925, Hergé enrolled in the École Saint-Luc art school, but finding the teaching boring, he left after one lesson. He hoped for a job as an illustrator alongside Ickx at \"Le Vingtième Siècle\" (\"The Twentieth Century\")—a conservative \"Catholic Newspaper of Doctrine and Information\"—but no positions were available. Instead he got a job in the paper's subscriptions department, starting in September 1925. Despising the boredom of this position, he enlisted for military service before he was called up, and in August 1926 was assigned to the Dailly barracks at Schaerbeek. Joining the first infantry regiment, he was also bored by his military training, but continued sketching and producing episodes of \"Totor\".\n\nToward the end of his military service, in August 1927, Hergé met the editor of \"Le Vingtième Siècle\", the Abbé Norbert Wallez, a vocal fascist who kept a signed photograph of the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini on his desk. Impressed by Hergé's repertoire, Wallez agreed to give him a job as a photographic reporter and cartoonist for the paper, something for which Hergé always remained grateful, coming to view the Abbé as a father figure. Supplemented by commissions for other publications, Hergé illustrated a number of texts for \"The Children's Corner\" and the literary pages; the illustrations of this period show his interest in woodcuts and the early prototype of his \"ligne claire\" style.\n\nBeginning a series of newspaper supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, \"Le Petit Vingtième\" (\"The Little Twentieth\"), which subsequently appeared in \"Le Vingtième Siècle\" every Thursday. Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. For this new venture, Hergé illustrated \"L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet\" (\"The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet\"), a comic strip authored by one of the paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium—such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as George McManus' \"Bringing Up Father\", George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat\" and Rudolph Dirks's \"The Katzenjammer Kids\", copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter Léon Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War.\n\nHergé developed a character named Tintin as a Belgian boy reporter who could travel the world with his fox terrier, Snowy—\"Milou\" in the original French—basing him in large part on his earlier character of Totor and also on his own brother, Paul. Degrelle later falsely claimed that Tintin had been based on him, while he and Hergé fell out when Degrelle used one of his designs without permission; they settled out-of-court. Although Hergé wanted to send his character to the United States, Wallez instead ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union, acting as a work of anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\", began serialisation in \"Le Petit Vingtième\" on 10 January 1929, and ran until 8 May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organized a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station, following which he organized the publication of the story in book form. The popularity of the story led to an increase in sales, and so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants, Eugène Van Nyverseel and Paul \"Jam\" Jamin.\n\nIn January 1930, Hergé introduced \"Quick & Flupke\" (\"Quick et Flupke\"), a new comic strip about two street kids from Brussels, in the pages of \"Le Petit Vingtième\". At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second Tintin adventure, \"Tintin in the Congo\", designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it would be accused of racism; however, at the time it was un-controversial and popular, with further publicity stunts held to increase sales. For the third adventure, \"Tintin in America\", serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Hergé finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, although he used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper's ultra-conservative ideology. Although the \"Adventures of Tintin\" had been serialised in the French Catholic \"Cœurs Vaillants\" (\"Brave Hearts\") since 1930, he was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too. Though wealthier than most Belgians at his age, and despite increasing success, he remained an unfazed \"conservative young man\" dedicated to his work.\n\nHergé sought work elsewhere too, creating \"The Lovable Mr. Mops\" cartoon for the Bon Marché department store, and \"The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West\" for the rival L'Innovation department store. On 20 July 1932 he married Germaine Kieckens, who was Wallez's secretary; although neither of them were entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged to do so by Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek. After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of \"Le Petit Vingtième\".\n\nIn November 1932 Hergé announced that the following month he would send Tintin on an adventure to Asia. Although initially titled \"The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient\", it would later be renamed \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\". A mystery story, the plot began in Egypt before proceeding to Arabia and India, during which the recurring characters of Thomson and Thompson and Rastapopoulos were introduced. Through his friend Charles Lesne, Hergé was hired to produce illustrations for the company Casterman, and in late 1933 they proposed taking over the publication of both \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Quick and Flupke\" in book form, to which Hergé agreed; the first Casterman book was the collected volume of \"Cigars\". Continuing to subsidise his comic work with commercial advertising, in January 1934 he also founded the \"Atelier Hergé\" advertising company with two partners, but it was liquidated after six months. From February to August 1934 Hergé serialised \"Popol Out West\" in \"Le Petit Vingtième\", a story using animal characters that was a development of the earlier \"Tim the Squirrel\" comic.\n\nFrom August 1934 to October 1935, \"Le Petit Vingtième\" serialised Tintin's next adventure, \"The Blue Lotus\", which was set in China and dealt with the recent Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Hergé had been greatly influenced in the production of the work by his friend Zhang Chongren, a Catholic Chinese student studying at Brussels' Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts, to whom he had been introduced in May 1934. Zhang gave him lessons in Taoist philosophy, Chinese art and Chinese calligraphy, influencing not only his artistic style but also his general outlook on life. As a token of appreciation Hergé added a fictional \"Chang Chong-Chen\" to \"The Blue Lotus\", a young Chinese boy who meets and befriends Tintin. For \"The Blue Lotus\", Hergé devoted far more attention to accuracy, resulting in a largely realistic portrayal of China. As a result, \"The Blue Lotus\" has been widely hailed as \"Hergé's first masterpiece\" and a benchmark in the series' development. Casterman published it in book form, also insisting that Hergé include colour plates in both the volume and in reprints of \"America\" and \"Cigars\". In 1936, they also began production of Tintin merchandise, something Hergé supported, having ideas of an entire shop devoted to \"The Adventures of Tintin\", something that would come to fruition 50 years later. Nevertheless, while his serialised comics proved lucrative, the collected volumes sold less well, something Hergé blamed on Casterman, urging them to do more to market his books.\nHergé's next Tintin story, \"The Broken Ear\" (1935–37), was the first for which the plot synopsis had been outlined from the start, being a detective story that took Tintin to South America. It introduced the character of General Alcazar, and also saw Hergé introduce the first fictional countries into the series, San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico, two republics based largely on Bolivia and Paraguay.\nThe violent elements within \"The Broken Ear\" upset the publishers of \"Cœurs Vaillants\", who asked Hergé to create a more child-appropriate story for them. The result was \"The Adventures of Jo, Zette, and Jocko\", a series about a young brother and sister and their pet monkey. The series began with \"The Secret Ray\", which was serialised in \"Cœurs Vaillants\" and then \"Le Petit Vingtième\", and continued with \"The Stratoship H-22\". Hergé nevertheless disliked the series, commenting that the characters \"bored me terribly.\" Now writing three series simultaneously, Hergé was working every day of the year, and felt stressed.\n\nThe next Tintin adventure was \"The Black Island\" (1937–38), which saw the character travel to Britain to battle counterfeiters and introduced a new antagonist, the German Dr. Müller. Hergé followed this with \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" (1938–39), in which Tintin saves the fictional Eastern European country of Syldavia from being invaded by its expansionist neighbour, Borduria; the event was an anti-fascist satire of Nazi Germany's expansion into Austria and Czechoslovakia. In May 1939, Hergé moved to a new house in Watermael-Boitsfort, although following the German invasion of Poland, he was conscripted into the Belgian army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Demobbed within the month, he returned to Brussels and adopted a more explicit anti-German stance when beginning his next Tintin adventure, \"Land of Black Gold\", which was set in the Middle East and featured Dr. Müller sabotaging oil lines.\n\nDuring this period, Hergé also contributed to \"L'Ouest\" (\"The West\"), a newspaper run by his friend Raymond De Becker. \"L'Ouest\" urged Belgium to remain neutral in World War II, a stance Hergé supported, creating the \"Mr Bellum\" strip to argue this position. Hergé was invited to visit China by Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed \"The Blue Lotus\", although due to the political situation in Europe, this was not possible. He was re-mobilized in December, and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to \"Le Petit Vingtième\". However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for military service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium. \"Le Vingtième Siècle\" was shut down, part way through the serialisation of \"Land of Black Gold\".\n\nAs the Belgian army clashed with the invading Germans, Hergé and his wife fled by car to France along with tens of thousands of other Belgians, first staying in Paris and then heading south to Puy-de-Dôme, where they remained for six weeks. On 28 May, Belgian King Leopold III surrendered the country to the German army to prevent further killing; a move that Hergé supported. He followed the king's request that all of those Belgians who had fled the country return, arriving back in Brussels on 30 June. There, he found that his house had been occupied as an office for the German army's \"Propagandastaffel\", and also faced financial trouble, as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves. All Belgian publications were now under the control of the German occupying force, who refused permission to continue publication. Instead, Hergé was offered employment as a cartoonist for by its editor, the Rexist Victor Matthys; however, Hergé perceived as an explicitly political publication, and thus declined the position.\nInstead, he took up a position with , Belgium's largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted \"Le Soir\" to be re-opened under the directorship of De Doncker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining the \"Le Soir\" team on 15 October, Hergé was involved in the creation of a children's supplement, \"Soir-Jeunesse\", aided by Jamin and Jacques Van Melkebeke. He relaunched \"The Adventures of Tintin\" with a new story, \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\", in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story was a turning point in the series for its introduction of Captain Haddock, who would become a major character in the rest of the \"Adventures\". This story, like the subsequent \"Adventures of Tintin\" published in \"Le Soir\", would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining firmly neutral. Hergé also included new \"Quick & Flupke\" gags in the supplement, as well as illustrations for serialised stories by Edgar Allan Poe and the Brothers Grimm.\n\nIn May 1941, a paper shortage led to the \"Soir-Jeunesse\" being reduced to four pages, with the length of the Tintin strip being cut by two thirds. Several weeks later the supplement disappeared altogether, with \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\" being moved into \"Le Soir\" itself, where it became a daily strip. While some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration, he was heavily enticed by the size of 's readership, which reached 600,000.\nWith Van Melkebeke, Hergé put together two Tintin plays. The first, \"Tintin in the Indies\", appeared at Brussels' Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, \"Mr Boullock's Disappearance\", was performed there in December. From October 1941 to May 1942, \"Le Soir\" serialised Hergé's next Tintin adventure, \"The Shooting Star\", followed by publication as a single volume by Casterman. In keeping with \"Le Soir\"'s editorial standpoint, \"The Shooting Star\" espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Hergé denied any malicious anti-Semitic intention.\n\nCasterman felt that the black-and-white volumes of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, and that it would not be used for shading.\nTo cope with this additional workload, Hergé approached a friend whom he had met through Van Melkebeke, Edgar P. Jacobs, to aid him as a cartoonist and colourist. Jacobs could only work on the project part time, and so in March 1942 Hergé also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him. In July 1942, Hergé then procured an agent, Bernard Thièry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained. With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Hergé adapted most of his previous \"Adventures of Tintin\" into 62-page colour versions.\n\nHergé's next \"Adventure of Tintin\" would be \"The Secret of the Unicorn\", serialised in \"Le Soir\" from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had introduced many elements from the work of Jules Verne into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. \"The Secret of the Unicorn\" marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in \"Red Rackham's Treasure\", serialised in \"Le Soir\" from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following \"Red Rackham's Treasure\", Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled \"Dupont et Dupond, détectives\" (\"Thomson and Thompson, Detectives\"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.\n\nIn September 1943, De Becker was removed as editor of \"Le Soir\" for stating that although the Nazis were motivated \"by undoubted good will, [they were also] extremely out of touch with reality\"; although Hergé was close to De Becker, he decided to remain at the newspaper, which came under the editorship of Max Hodeige.\nIn autumn 1943, Hergé had decided that he wanted Jacobs to collaborate with him on \"The Adventures of Tintin\". Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next \"Adventure of Tintin\", \"The Seven Crystal Balls\", which began serialisation in \"Le Soir\" in December 1943.\n\nAs the Allied troops liberated Brussels from German occupation, \"Le Soir\" ceased publication on 2 September 1944, partway through its serialisation of \"The Seven Crystal Balls\". Hergé was arrested on 3 September, having been named as a collaborator in a Resistance document known as the \"Gallery of Traitors\". This would be the first of four incidents in which Hergé was arrested – by the State Security, the Judiciary Police, the Belgian National Movement, and the Front for Independence respectively – during the course of which he spent one night in jail. On 5 September the entire staff of \"Le Soir\" were fired and a new editorial team introduced, while on 8 September the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) issued a proclamation announcing that \"any journalist who had helped produce a newspaper during the occupation was for the time being barred from practising his profession.\" Blacklisted, Hergé was now unemployed. Further, he was publicly lampooned as a collaborator by a newspaper closely associated with the Belgian Resistance, \"La Patrie\", which issued a satirical strip titled \"The Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the Nazis\".\n\nThe period witnessed widespread recriminations against accused collaborators, with military courts condemning 30,000 on minor charges and 25,000 on more serious charges; of those, 5,500 were sentenced to life imprisonment or capital punishment. A judiciary inquiry into Hergé's case was launched by the deputy public prosecutor, Mr Vinçotte, although in his report he urged lenience, stating that \"I am inclined to close the case. I believe it would bring ridicule on the judicial system to go after an inoffensive children's book author and illustrator. On the other hand, Hergé worked for \"Le Soir\" during the war, and his illustrations are what made people buy the newspaper.\" Although unable to work for the press, Hergé continued to re-draw and colour the older \"Adventures of Tintin\" for publication in book form by Casterman, completing the second version of \"Tintin in the Congo\" and starting on \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\". Casterman supported Hergé throughout his ordeal, for which he always remained grateful. Attempting to circumvent his blacklisting, with Jacobs he began producing comics under the anonymous pseudonym of \"Olav\", but upon sending them to publishers found none who would accept them. Although this period allowed him an escape from the pressure of daily production which had affected most of his working life, he also had family problems to deal with; his brother Paul returned to Brussels from a German prisoner of war camp, although their mother had become highly delusional and was moved to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn October 1945, Hergé was approached by Raymond Leblanc, a former member of a conservative Resistance group, the National Royalist Movement, and his associates André Sinave and Albert Debaty. The trio were planning on launching a weekly magazine for children, and Leblanc – who had fond childhood memories of \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\" – thought Hergé would be ideal for it. Hergé agreed, and Leblanc obtained clearance papers for him, allowing him to work. Concerned about the judicial investigation into Hergé's wartime affiliations, Leblanc convinced William Ugeux, a leader of the Belgian Resistance who was now in charge of censorship and certificates of good citizenship, to look into the comic creator's file. Ugeux concluded that Hergé had been \"a blunderer rather than a traitor\" for his work at \"Le Soir\". The decision as to whether Hergé would stand trial belonged to the general auditor of the Military Tribunal, Walter Jean Ganshof van der Meersch. He closed the case on 22 December 1945, declaring that \"in regard to the particularly inoffensive character of the drawings published by Remi, bringing him before a war tribunal would be inappropriate and risky\".\n\nNow free from threat of prosecution, Hergé continued to support his colleagues at \"Le Soir\" who were being charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences. Among those sentenced to death was Hergé's friend, Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In May 1946, Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium. Celebrations were marred by his mother's death in April 1946; she was aged 60.\nHarry Thompson has described this post-war period as the \"greatest upheaval\" of Hergé's life. Hergé later described it as \"an experience of absolute intolerance. It was horrible, horrible!\" He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people, and never forgave Belgian society for the way that he had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.\n\nSinave devised the idea of naming their new magazine \"Tintin\", believing that this would attract a wide audience. The Dutch-language edition produced for release in Belgium's Flemish north was titled \"Kuifje\" after the character's Dutch-language name. Adopting the slogan of \"The Newspaper for the Young Aged 7 to 77\", the magazine also used a logo featuring the Tintin character himself.\nThe capital for the project had been put up by those involved: as executive director, Leblanc provided 50%, while its managing director Georges Lallemand provided 40% and Hergé, its artistic director, provided 10%. Hergé assembled a group of associates to aid him, including Van Melkebeke, Jacobs, Paul Cuvelier, and Jacques Laudy.\nVan Melkebeke was initially appointed editor-in-chief, although he was arrested for having worked for the collaborationist \"Le Nouveau journal\" shortly after, with his involvement in the project thus being kept secret so as to avoid further controversy. Van Melkebeke continued to provide work for the magazine under pseudonyms, although this ceased during his imprisonment from December 1947 to October 1949.\n\nThe first issue of \"Tintin\" magazine was published on 26 September 1946. Hergé was assigned to produce a two-page spread each week, and began by concluding \"The Seven Crystal Balls\" before embarking on its successor story, \"Prisoners of the Sun\". Alongside Hergé's \"Adventures of Tintin\", the magazine also included Laudy's \"The Legend of the Four Aymon Brothers\" and Jacobs' \"The Secret of the Swordfish\", the first in his new \"Blake and Mortimer\" series. While the magazine was in competition with a number of rivals, most notably \"Spirou\", famous for serialising the \"Lucky Luke\" and \"Buck Danny\" comics, it proved an immediate success, with 60,000 copies being sold in three days of its release. Its publication resulted in a massive boost to Hergé's book sales too.\n\nIn 1947 a Belgian film adaptation of \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\" was produced, and believing that cinematic adaptations were a good way to proceed, Hergé contacted Disney Studios in the United States; they declined his offer to adapt \"The Adventures of Tintin\" for the silver screen.\nIn May 1947 the artistic collaboration between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument. Hergé had been jealous of the immediate success of Jacobs' \"Blake and Mortimer\" series, and had turned down Jacobs' request that he be credited as co-creator of the new \"Adventures of Tintin\". That same month, Hergé broke from his manager, Thiery, after discovering that the latter had been siphoning off money for himself.\n\nMany Belgians were highly critical of the magazine due to its connections with Hergé, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; \"La Soir\" and \"La Cité\" publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while \"Le Quotidien\" and \"Le Drapeau Rouge\" specifically singled him out for denunciation. Hergé believed that the children's author Jeanne Cappe was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit. Unhappy with life in Belgium, Hergé made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his mind, for reasons that have remained unknown; it is possible that he was unable to secure any promise of work in the South American country.\n\nIn May, Hergé and Germaine holidayed near to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland, where they were accompanied by a friend of theirs, a young woman named Rosane. During the holiday, Hergé and Rosane embarked on an extra-marital affair. He felt guilty, and returned to Brussels in June. Privately, he expressed the view that he had been led to commit such an act, which he viewed as immoral, through the influence of \"amoral friends\" that he was associating with. Hoping to reignite the passion and stability of his marriage, he arranged for him and Germaine to return to Switzerland soon after; here they argued, and embarked on a temporary separation. Remaining in Switzerland, he visited King Leopold III, who was then holidaying in Prégny, before briefly returning to Brussels in July. Back in Switzerland, he embarked on an affair with a married woman, although again informed Germaine before setting off to spend time in Ardenne. In August, the couple sought to reunite by holidaying together in Brittany, but there they broke up again and Hergé returned to his lover in Switzerland. In September he finally returned to Brussels, but with his close friend Marcel Dehaye then spent time in a retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. That month, he revived \"Land of Black Gold\" – the \"Adventure of Tintin\" that had been interrupted by the German invasion of 1940 – and began serialising it in \"Tintin\" magazine. However, the story was again interrupted, this time for twelve weeks as Hergé took a further unannounced holiday to Gland, greatly annoying many of his colleagues.\n\nAlthough they retained respect for each other, Hergé's repeated absences had created a tense situation between himself and Leblanc. After a lengthy search, Leblanc had found a publisher willing to produce an edition of \"Tintin\" magazine in France: Georges Dargaud's Le Lombard, which began production of a French edition in October 1948. However, Hergé was unhappy that Leblanc had appointed André Frenez as Van Melkebeke's replacement as editor-in-chief, describing Frenez as \"a cold functionary\". Hergé was stubborn and uncompromising as the magazine's artistic director, known for strongly criticising the work of old friends like Pierre Ickx if he felt that they did not meet his exacting standards. He was particularly critical of the work of two of the newly hired staff at \"Tintin\" and \"Kuifje\", Jacques Martin and Willy Vandersteen, encouraging them to change their artistic style to better reflect his own preferences. To Leblanc, he expressed the concern that most of those working at \"Tintin\" were better illustrators than storytellers. He also opined that \"Tintin\" was not keeping up with the times and what he perceived as the increased maturity of children, encouraging the magazine to better reflect current events and scientific developments.\n\nOn 6 April 1950 Hergé established Studios Hergé as a public company. The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in Céroux-Mousty his and Germaine's main abode.\nThe Studios would provide both personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work.\nInitially with only three employees, this would rise to fifteen, with all working on Hergé's projects. He hired Bob de Moor as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951. Impressed by Jacques Martin's work on \"The Golden Sphinx\", Hergé persuaded Martin to join the Studios in January 1954; Martin insisted on bringing with him his own two assistants, Roger Leloup and Michel Demaurets.\nDuring the early 1950s, a number of those convicted for collaborating with the Nazi occupiers were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Hergé lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at \"Tintin\" magazine, much to Leblanc's annoyance. For instance, as well as lending him money, Hergé used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector. He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the Walloon Legion, and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working at \"Le Nouveau Journal\" during the occupation.\n\nHergé had developed the idea of setting an \"Adventure of Tintin\" on the moon while producing \"Prisoners of the Sun\". He began serialisation of \"Destination Moon\", the first of a two part arc followed by \"Explorers on the Moon\", in \"Tintin\" magazine in March 1950. In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story, feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to \"Tintin\" asking why \"Explorers on the Moon\" was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. \"Explorers of the Moon\" would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.\nAlongside his work on the new stories, Hergé also made use of the Studios in revising more of his early works.\n\nIn February 1952, Hergé was involved in a car crash in which Germaine's leg was shattered; she had to have a steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months. Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez's death in September 1952. His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due to advice gained from an alleged clairvoyant, Bertje Janueneau, whom both Hergé and Germaine were increasingly relying upon for guidance. In January 1955 a young woman named Fanny Vlamynck was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Hergé embarked on an extra-marital affair with her in November 1956, with the rest of the studio staff soon finding out. Germaine grew suspicious of her husband's affections for Fanny, but was also experiencing a strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner. Hergé and Germaine went on a cruise for the former's fiftieth birthday in May 1957, in which they visited Casablanca, Rabat, Palermo, and Rome, and in October went on a second holiday, this time to Ostend. Following this, he revealed his affair with Fanny to Germaine.\nHe began experiencing traumatic dreams dominated by the colour white, and seeking to explain them he visited Franz Ricklin, a psychoanalyst who was a student of Carl Jung in Zurich in May 1959. In February 1960 he returned to Switzerland, and upon its arrival back in Brussels he began renting an apartment in Uccle, away from Germaine. His relationship with Germaine had ended, although due to restrictions under Belgian law he was unable to obtain a divorce until seventeen years later.\n\nIn September 1958, \"Tintin\" magazine moved its headquarters to a newly constructed building near the Gare du Midi. Hergé continued to feud with Leblanc over the direction of the magazine; his constant absences had led to him being replaced as artistic director, and he demanded that he be reinstated. Leblanc relented in early 1965, although Hergé soon departed to Sardinia for six weeks. In October 1965 Leblanc appointed the cartoonist Greg to be editor-in-chief of the magazine, believing him capable of reforming the paper to remain relevant to the youth of the day. By this point, \"Tintin\" magazine was at its commercial peak, with sales of 600,000 a week, although Hergé had lost much of his interest in it.\n\nHergé's book sales were higher than ever, and translations were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in \"France-Observateur\", \"The Listener\", and \"Times Literary Supplement\". Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, \"Le Monde de Tintin\" (\"The World of Tintin\"), published by Gallimard; Hergé vetoed the inclusion of a proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing. Radio adaptations of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision, \"Hergé's Adventures of Tintin\". Two live-action films were also produced, \"Tintin and the Golden Fleece\" (1961) and \"Tintin and the Blue Oranges\" (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.\n\nDeveloping an interest in modern art, in the early 1960s Hergé befriended the art dealer Marcel Stal, owner of the Carrefour gallery in Brussels. He was a particular fan of the work of Constant Permeke, Jakob Smits, Lucio Fontana, and Jean-Pierre Raynaurd, as well as the pop art movement, in particular the work of Roy Lichtenstein. He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as African art and Chinese ceramics.\nIn 1962, Hergé decided he wanted to paint. He chose Louis Van Lint, one of the most respected Belgian abstract painters at the time, whose work he liked a lot, to be his private teacher.\nHergé took up painting as a hobby, producing abstract art works which were influenced by the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work to the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.\nSpending less time on new \"Adventures of Tintin\", from June to December 1965 \"Tintin\" magazine serialised a redrawn and newly coloured version of \"The Black Island\" prepared by staff at Studios Hergé. Supported by his studio, Hergé produced \"The Calculus Affair\" between 1954 until 1956 which was followed by \"The Red Sea Sharks\" in 1956 to 1957.\n\nIn the 1960s, Hergé became increasingly annoyed at the success of René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's \"Asterix\" comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing \"The Adventures of Tintin\" as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate the success of the recent animated films \"Asterix the Gaul\" (1967) and \"Asterix and Cleopatra\" (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the \"Adventures of Tintin\". The first, \"Tintin and the Temple of the Sun\" (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, \"Tintin and the Lake of Sharks\" (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982 the American filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of \"The Adventures of Tintin\", a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.\n\nIn October 1971, the journalist Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, in which the latter opened up about many of the problems he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as \"Tintin et moi\" (\"Tintin and I\") in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, \"Moi, Tintin\" (\"I, Tintin\"), which premiered in 1975.\nIn January 1977 he attended an early comic book convention at Angoulême, where he was widely heralded as one of the masters of the discipline. To mark the fiftieth anniversary of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" in 1979, a celebratory event was held at Brussels' Hilton hotel, while an exhibit on \"Le Musée imaginaire de Tintin\" (\"The Imaginary Museum of Tintin\") was held at the Palais de Beaux-Arts.\n\nIn April 1971 Hergé visited the United States for the first time, primarily to visit a liver specialist in Rochester, Minnesota, but on the trip he also visited a Sioux reservation in South Dakota, but was shocked at the conditions in which their inhabitants' lived. On this visit he also spent time in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Kansas City. \nIn April 1973, Hergé took up an invite to visit Taiwan by the nation's government, in recognition of his promotion of Chinese culture in \"The Blue Lotus\". During the visit he also spent time in Thailand and Bali.\n\nHergé had long sought to regain contact with his old friend Zhang Chongren, with whom he had lost contact. He regularly asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact with his old friend. The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.\n\nIn June 1970, Hergé's father died, and after the funeral he holidayed near Lake Geneva.\nIn 1974, his assistant Branden suffered a stroke and was left unable to write, with Hergé replacing him with a young man, Alain Baran, who Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline later termed Hergé's \"surrogate son\". In March 1977, Hergé's divorce with Germaine was finalised; although Hergé continued to visit her and financially support her, Germaine took the divorce badly, viewing it as a further betrayal. Hergé was then able to marry Fanny several weeks later, in a low-key ceremony on 20 May; he was 70 years old and she 42.\n\nIn 1979, Hergé was diagnosed with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete blood transfusion. His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week.\n\nOn 25 February 1983, Hergé entered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive care at Brussels' Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc. He died there on 3 March. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including \"Libération\" and \"Le Monde\". In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir.\n\nIn November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the Hergé Foundation.\n\nIn 1988, \"Tintin\" magazine itself was discontinued.\n\nHergé was a highly private person, being described by biographer Harry Thompson as \"reserved [and] unostentatious\". According to his biographer Pierre Sterckx, Hergé appeared \"very conventional\" in public but in reality was \"extremely erudite, with an insatiable curiosity, constantly on the watch\". He greatly enjoyed walking in the countryside, gardening, and art collecting, and he was a fan of jazz music. Although he disliked making public or press appearances, Hergé insisted on personally responding to all fan mail received, which took up a considerable part of his time. He stated that \"not replying to children's letters would be to betray their dreams.\" Friends described him as a humorous man, known particularly for his self-deprecating jokes. Colleagues described Hergé as egocentric, an assessment he agreed with. He was known to be authoritarian in dealing with his assistants and refused to share credit with them for their part in his work. Sterckx noted that \"on the one hand he could be distant, even frosty, but on the other he was affectionate\".\n\nThroughout his first marriage he had a number of affairs with other women. He had no children, having been rendered sterile by radiation treatment, but in the 1950s offered to adopt his brother Paul's two children, Denise and George, when their parents were experiencing trouble in their relationship. Paul declined the offer, with Denise and George later noting that they had no great affection for Hergé, deeming him awkward around children. Hergé was raised as a Catholic although was never a devout practitioner of the religion. His adherence to Catholicism declined in later life as he developed a keen interest in Taoism, and became an agnostic. He was a fan of the \"Tao Te Ching\" and Arnaud Desjardins' \"The Path to Wisdom\", as well as Fritjof Capra's \"The Tao of Physics\" and the work of Jean-Émile Charon.\n\nPolitically, Hergé was a fervent royalist, and remained so throughout his life, also believing in the unity of Belgium.\nIn his early life, Hergé was \"close to the traditional right-wing\" of Belgian society, with Sterckx noting that through his work he was \"plunged into rightist, even extreme right-wing circles\". According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were not unusual in middle-class circles in Belgium of the 1920s and early 1930s, where \"patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline and naivety were so inextricably bound together in everyone's lives that right-wing politics were an almost inevitable by-product. It was a world view shared by everyone, distinguished principally by its complete ignorance of the world.\" When Hergé took responsibility for , he followed Wallez's instruction and allowed the newspaper to contain explicitly pro-fascist and anti-semitic sentiment. Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès noted that the character of Tintin was a personification of the \"New Youth\" concept which was promoted by the European far right. Under Wallez's guidance, the early \"Adventures of Tintin\" contained explicit political messages for its young readership. \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\" was a work of anti-socialist propaganda, while \"Tintin in the Congo\" was designed to encourage colonialist sentiment toward the Belgian Congo, and \"Tintin in America\" was designed as a work of anti-Americanism heavily critical of capitalism, commercialism, and industrialisation.\n\nIn contrast to Hergé's involvement in Belgium's right-wing, Sterckx thought the cartoonist to have been \"a liberal and independent spirit\", someone who was \"the very opposite of a conservative [or] a reactionary of the right\". Michael Farr asserted that Hergé had \"an acute political conscience\" during his earlier days, as exemplified by his condemnation of racism in the United States evident in \"Tintin in America\". Literary critic Tom McCarthy went further, remarking that \"Tintin in America\" represented the emergence of a \"left-wing counter tendency\" in Hergé's work that rebelled against his right-wing milieu and which was particularly critical of wealthy capitalists and industrialists. This was furthered in \"The Blue Lotus\", in which Hergé rejected his \"classically right-wing\" ideas to embrace an anti-imperialist stance, and in a contemporary \"Quick & Flupke\" strip in which he lampooned the far right leaders of Germany and Italy, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Although many of his friends and colleagues did so in the mid-1930s, Hergé did not join the far-right Rexist Party, later asserting that he \"had always had an aversion to it\" and commenting that \"to throw my heart and soul into an ideology is the opposite of who I am.\"\n\nHergé has faced repeated accusations of racism due to his portrayal of various ethnic groups throughout \"The Adventures of Tintin\". According to McCarthy, in \"Tintin in the Congo\" Hergé represented the Congolese as \"good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery\". Thompson argued that Hergé had not written the book to be \"deliberately racist\" and that it reflected the average early 20th-century Belgian view of the Congolese, which was more patronising than malevolent. The book provoked no controversy at the time, only coming to be perceived as racist in the latter 20th century.\n\nIn the following adventure, \"Tintin in America\", Hergé depicted members of the Blackfoot tribe of Native Americans as \"gullible, even naive\", though it was nevertheless \"broadly sympathetic\" to their culture and plight, depicting their oppression at the hands of the United States army. In \"The Blue Lotus\", he depicted the Japanese as militaristic and buck-toothed, which has also drawn accusations of racism.\n\nHergé has also been accused of utilising anti-semitic stereotypes. The character of Rastapopoulos has been claimed to be based on anti-semitic stereotypes, despite Hergé's protestations that the character was Greek, and not Jewish.\n\nFrom his early years, Hergé was openly critical of racism. He lambasted the pervasive racism of United States society in a prelude comment to \"Tintin in America\" published in \"Le Petit Vingtième\" on 20 August 1931, and ridiculed racist attitudes toward the Chinese in \"The Blue Lotus\". Peeters asserted that \"Hergé was no more racist than the next man\", an assessment shared by Farr, who after meeting Hergé in the 1980s commented that \"you couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist\". In contrast, President of the International \"Bande Dessinée\" Society Laurence Grove opined that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that \"When it was fashionable to be a Nazi, he was a Nazi. When it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that's what he was.\"\n\nAssouline described Hergé as \"the personification of Belgium\".\n\n\nAccording to the UNESCO's Index Translationum, Hergé is the ninth-most-often-translated French-language author, the second-most-often-translated Belgian author after Georges Simenon, and the second-most-often-translated French-language comics author behind René Goscinny. He also had an asteroid, 1652 Hergé, within the main belt, named after him in 1953.\n\nA cartoon version of Hergé makes a number of cameo appearances in Ellipse-Nelvana's \"The Adventures of Tintin\" TV cartoon series. An animated version of Hergé also makes a cameo appearance at the start of the 2011 performance capture film, \"\", directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson, where he is depicted as a street cartoonist drawing a portrait of Tintin at the start of the film.\n\nThe Musée Hergé is located in the centre of Louvain-la-Neuve, a city to the south of Brussels. This location was originally chosen for the Museum in 2001. The futuristic building was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning French architect Christian de Portzamparc and cost €15 million to build. On the centenary of the birth of Hergé, 22 May 2007, the museum's first stone was laid. The museum opened its doors in June 2009.\n\nThe idea of a museum dedicated to the work of Hergé can be traced back to the end of the 1970s, when Hergé was still alive. After his death in 1983, Hergé's widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the Hergé Foundation and then by the new Studios Hergé, to catalogue and choose the artwork and elements that would become part of the Museum's exhibitions.\n\nThe Hergé Museum contains eight permanent galleries displaying original artwork by Hergé, and telling the story of his life and career which had not previously been visible to the public. The Museum also houses a temporary exhibition gallery. Although Tintin features prominently in the museum, Hergé's other comic strip characters, such as Jo, Zette and Jocko, and Quick and Flupke, as well as his work as a graphic designer, are also present.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for developing the theory underlying the literacy philosophy of whole language.\n\nAfter publishing an influential book on the subject, Goodman began to create a psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic model of reading inspired by the work of Noam Chomsky. Goodman decided that the process of reading was similar to the process of learning a language as conceptualized by Chomsky, and that literacy developed naturally as a consequence of experiences with print, just as language ability developed naturally as a consequence of experiences with language. Goodman concluded that attempts to teach rules (\"phonics\") to children for decoding words were inappropriate and not likely to succeed.\n\nAfter developing and researching the Whole Language model, Goodman presented his work to the American Educational Research Association (AERA) conference and published an article in the \"Journal of the Reading Specialist,\" in which he famously wrote that reading is a \"psycholinguistic guessing game.\" He retired from the University of Arizona in August 1998.\n\nGoodman's concept of written language development views it as parallel to oral language development. Goodman's theory was a basis for the whole language movement, which was further developed by Yetta Goodman, Regie Routman, Frank Smith and others. His concept of reading as an analogue to language development has been studied by brain researchers such as Sally Shaywitz, who rejected the theory on the grounds that reading does not develop naturally in the absence of instruction. Despite this, the theory continues to receive support from some scholars. Goodman's theory and strong convictions made him an icon of the whole language movement and a lightning rod for criticism from those who disgree with it. His book \"What's Whole in Whole Language\" sold over 250,000 copies in six languages.\n\nGoodman is a controversial figure in the education community. He has served in several important capacities, including as President of the International Reading Association, President of the National Conference on Research in Language and Literacy, and President of the Center for Expansion of Language and Thinking. He also worked extensively with the National Council of Teachers of English. He received a number of awards, including the James Squire award from NCTE for contributions to the profession and NCTE (2007). Goodman has published over 150 articles and book chapters as well as a number of books. In addition to \"What's Whole in Whole Language\", he also wrote \"Ken Goodman on Reading\" and \"Phonics Phacts\"; all were published by Heinemann. His latest book is \"Scientific Realism in Studies of Education\", which was published by Taylor and Francis in 2007.\n"}

However, the terms \"Franks\" and \"Frankish\" were actually applied to all Western Europeans during the late Byzantine Period. Later, the meaning of \"lingua franca\" expanded to mean any bridge language. Its other name in the Mediterranean area was \"Sabir\", deriving from a Romance base meaning \"to know\".\n\nBased mostly on Northern Italian languages (mainly Venetian and Genoese dialects) and Occitano-Romance languages (Catalan and Occitan) in the western Mediterranean area at first, it later came to have more Spanish and Portuguese elements, especially on the Barbary coast (today referred to as the Maghreb). Sabir also borrowed from Berber, Turkish, French, Greek and Arabic. This mixed language was used widely for commerce and diplomacy and was also current among slaves of the bagnio, Barbary pirates and European renegades in pre-colonial Algiers. Historically the first to use it were the Genoese and Venetian trading colonies in the eastern Mediterranean after the year 1000.\n\nHugo Schuchardt (1842–1927) was the first scholar to investigate the Lingua Franca systematically. According to the monogenetic theory of the origin of pidgins he developed, Lingua Franca was known by Mediterranean sailors including the Portuguese. When Portuguese started exploring the seas of Africa, America, Asia and Oceania, they tried to communicate with the natives by mixing a Portuguese-influenced version of Lingua Franca with the local languages. When English or French ships came to compete with the Portuguese, the crews tried to learn this \"broken Portuguese\". Through a process of relexification, the Lingua Franca and Portuguese lexicon was substituted by the languages of the peoples in contact.\n\nThis theory is one way of explaining the similarities between most of the European-based pidgins and creole languages, such as Tok Pisin, Papiamento, Sranan Tongo, Krio, and Chinese Pidgin English. These languages use forms similar to \"sabir\" for \"to know\" and \"piquenho\" for \"children\".\n\nLingua Franca left traces in present Algerian slang and Polari. There are traces even in geographical names, such as Cape Guardafui (that literally means cape \"look and escape\" in Lingua Franca and ancient Italian).\n\nAn example of Sabir is found in Molière's comedy \"Le Bourgeois gentilhomme\". At the start of the \"Turkish ceremony\", the Mufti enters singing the following words:\n\n<poem>Se ti sabir\nTi respondir\nSe non sabir\nTazir, tazir\n\nMi star Mufti:\nTi qui star ti?\nNon intendir:\nTazir, tazir.\n</poem>\n\nA comparison of the Sabir version with the same text in each of similar languages, first a word-for-word substitution according to the rules of Sabir grammar and then a translation inflected according to the rules of the similar language's grammar, can be seen below:\n\nThe Lombard, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, Provençal, French, and Latin versions are not correct grammatically, as they use the infinitive rather than inflected verb forms, but the Sabir form is obviously derived from the infinitive in those languages. The correct version for each language is given in italics.\n\n\n\n"}

P. Grice, H. Paul Grice, or Paul Grice, was a British philosopher of language, whose work on meaning has influenced the philosophical study of semantics. He is known for his theory of implicature.\n\nBorn and raised in Harborne (now a suburb of Birmingham), in the United Kingdom, he was educated at Clifton College and then at Corpus Christi College, Oxford.\nAfter a brief period teaching at Rossall School, he went back to Oxford where he taught at St John's College until 1967. In that year, he moved to the United States to take up a professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught until his death in 1988. He returned to the UK in 1979 to give the John Locke lectures on \"Aspects of Reason\". He reprinted many of his essays and papers in his valedictory book, \"Studies in the Way of Words\" (1989).\n\nHe was married and had two children.\n\nOne of Grice's two most influential contributions to the study of language and communication is his theory of meaning, which he began to develop in his article 'Meaning', written in 1948 but published only in 1957 at the prodding of his colleague, P.F. Strawson. Grice further developed his theory of meaning in the fifth and sixth of his William James lectures on \"Logic and Conversation\", delivered at Harvard in 1967. These two lectures were initially published as 'Utterer's Meaning and Intentions' in 1969 and 'Utterer's Meaning, Sentence Meaning, and Word Meaning' in 1968, and were later collected with the other lectures as the first section of Studies in the Way of Words in 1989.\n\nIn the 1948 article 'Meaning', Grice describes \"natural meaning\" using the example of \"Those spots mean (meant) measles.\"\n\nAnd describes \"non-natural meaning\" using the example of \"John means that he'll be late\" or \"'Schnee' means 'snow'\".\n\nGrice does not define these two senses of the verb 'to mean', and does not offer an explicit theory that separates the ideas they're used to express. Instead, he relies on five differences in ordinary language usage to show that we use the word in (at least) two different ways.\n\nFor the rest of 'Meaning', and in his discussions of meaning in 'Logic and Conversation', Grice deals exclusively with non-natural meaning. His overall approach to the study of non-natural meaning later came to be called \"intention-based semantics\", because it attempts to explain non-natural meaning based on the idea of a speakers' intentions. To do this, Grice made two kinds of non-natural meaning:\n\nUtterer's meaning: What a speaker means by an utterance. (Grice wouldn't introduce this label until \"Logic and Conversation.\" The more common label in contemporary work is \"speaker meaning\", though Grice didn't use that term.)\n\nTimeless meaning: The kind of meaning that can be possessed by a type of utterance, such as a word or a sentence. (This is often called \"conventional meaning\", although Grice didn't call it that.)\n\nThe two steps in intention-based semantics are (1) to define utterer's meaning in terms of speakers' overt audience-directed intentions, and then (2) to define timeless meaning in terms of utterer's meaning. The net effect is to define all linguistic notions of meaning in purely mental terms, and to thus shed psychological light on the semantic realm.\n\nGrice tries to accomplish the first step by means of the following definition:\n\nA meant something by x\" is roughly equivalent to \"A uttered x with the intention of inducing a belief by means of the recognition of this intention\".\n\n(In this definition, 'A' is a variable ranging over speakers and 'x' is a variable ranging over utterances.) Grice generalises this definition of speaker meaning later in 'Meaning' so that it applies to commands and questions, which, he argues, differ from assertions in that the speaker intends to induce an intention rather than a belief. Grice's initial definition was controversial, and seemingly gives rise to a variety of counterexamples, and so later adherents of intention-based semantics—including Grice himself, Stephen Schiffer, Jonathan Bennett, Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson, and Stephen Neale—have attempted to improve on it in various ways while keeping the basic idea intact.\n\nGrice next turns to the second step in his program: explaining the notion of timeless meaning in terms of the notion of utterer's meaning. He does so very tentatively with the following definition:\n\nx means (timeless) that so-and-so\" might as a first shot be equated with some statement or disjunction of statements about what \"people\" (vague) intend (with qualifications about \"recognition\") to effect by x.\n\nThe basic idea here is that the meaning of a word or sentence results from a regularity in what speakers use the word or sentence to mean. Grice would give a much more detailed theory of timeless meaning in his sixth Logic and Conversation lecture. A more influential attempt to expand on this component of intention-based semantics has been given by Stephen Schiffer.\n\nGrice's most influential contribution to philosophy and linguistics is his theory of implicature, which started in his 1961 article, 'The Causal Theory of Perception', and was most fully developed in his 1967 \"Logic and Conversation\", at Harvard's 'William James Lectures'.\n\nAccording to Grice, what a speaker means by an utterance can be divided into what the speaker \"says\" and what the speaker thereby \"implicates\".\n\nGrice makes it clear that the notion of saying he has in mind, though related to a colloquial sense of the word, is somewhat technical, referring to it as \"a favored notion of 'saying' that must be further elucidated\". Nonetheless, Grice never settled on a full elucidation or definition of his favoured notion of saying, and the interpretation of this notion has become a contentious issue in the philosophy of language.\n\nOne point of controversy surrounding Grice's favoured notion of saying is the connection between it and his concept of utterer's meaning. Grice makes it clear that he takes saying to be a kind of meaning, in the sense that doing the former entails doing the latter: \"I want to say that (1) \"U (utterer) said that p\" entails (2) \"U did something x by which U meant that p\" (87). This condition is controversial, but Grice argues that apparent counterexamples—cases in which a speaker apparently says something without meaning it—are actually examples of what he calls \"making as if to say\", which can be thought of as a kind of \"mock saying\" or \"play saying\".\n\nAnother point of controversy surrounding Grice's notion of saying is the relationship between what a speaker says with an expression and the expression's timeless meaning. Although he attempts to spell out the connection in detail several times, the most precise statement that he endorses is the following one:\n\nIn the sense in which I am using the word say, I intend what someone has said to be closely related to the conventional meaning of the words (the sentence) he has uttered.\n\nUnfortunately, Grice never spelled out what he meant by the phrase \"closely related\" in this passage, and philosophers of language continue to debate over its best interpretation.\n\nIn 'The Causal Theory of Perception', Grice contrasts saying (which he there also calls \"stating\") with \"implying\", but in Logic and Conversation he introduces the technical term \"implicature\" and its cognates \"to implicate\" and \"implicatum\" (i.e., that which is implicated). Grice justifies this neologism by saying that \"'Implicature' is a blanket word to avoid having to make choices between words like 'imply', 'suggest', 'indicate', and 'mean'\".\n\nGrice sums up these notions by suggesting that to implicate is to perform a \"non-central\" speech act, whereas to say is to perform a \"central\" speech act. As others have more commonly put the same distinction, saying is a kind of \"direct\" speech act whereas implicating is an \"indirect\" speech act. This latter way of drawing the distinction is an important part of John Searle's influential theory of speech acts.\n\nAlthough Grice is best known for his theory of conversational implicature, he also introduced the notion of conventional implicature. The difference between the two lies in the fact that what a speaker conventionally implicates by uttering a sentence is tied in some way to the timeless meaning of part of the sentence, whereas what a speaker conversationally implicates is not directly connected with timeless meaning. Grice's best-known example of conventional implicature involves the word 'but', which, he argues, differs in meaning from the word 'and' only in that we typically conventionally implicate something over and above what we say with the former but not with the latter. In uttering the sentence 'She was poor but she was honest', for example, we say merely that she was poor and she was honest, but we implicate that poverty contrasts with honesty (or that her poverty contrasts with her honesty).\n\nGrice makes it clear that what a speaker conventionally implicates by uttering a sentence is part of what the speaker means in uttering it, and that it is also closely connected to what the sentence means. Nonetheless, what a speaker conventionally implicates is not a part of what the speaker says.\n\nU's doing \"x\" might be his uttering the sentence \"She was poor but she was honest\". What \"U\" meant, and what the sentence means, will both contain something contributed by the word \"but\", and I do not want this contribution to appear in an account of what (in my favored sense) \"U\" said (but rather as a conventional implicature).\n\nGrice did not elaborate much on the notion of conventional implicature, but many other authors have tried to give more extensive theories of it, including Lauri Karttunen and Stanley Peters, Kent Bach, Stephen Neale, and Christopher Potts.\n\nTo conversationally implicate something in speaking, according to Grice, is to mean something that goes beyond what one says in such a way that it must be inferred from non-linguistic features of a conversational situation together with general principles of communication and co-operation.\n\nThe general principles Grice proposed are what he called the Cooperative principle and the Maxims of Conversation. According to Grice, the cooperative principle is a norm governing all cooperative interactions among humans.\n\nCooperative Principle: \"Make your contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.\" (Grice 1989: 26).\n\nThe conversational maxims can be thought of as precisifications of the cooperative principle that deal specifically with communication.\n\nMaxim of Quantity: Information\n\nMaxim of Quality: Truth\n\nMaxim of Relation: Relevance\n\nMaxim of Manner: Clarity (\"be perspicuous\")\n\nGrice follows his summary of the maxims by suggesting that \"one might need others\", and goes on to say that \"There are, of course, all sorts of other maxims (aesthetic, social, or moral in character), such as \"Be polite\", that are also normally observed by participants in exchanges, and these may also generate nonconventional implicatures.\"\n\nConversational implicatures are made possible, according to Grice, by the fact that the participants in a conversation always assume each other to behave according to the maxims. So, when a speaker appears to have violated a maxim by saying or making as if to say something that is false, uninformative or too informative, irrelevant, or unclear, the assumption that the speaker is in fact obeying the maxims causes the interpreter to infer a hypothesis about what the speaker really meant. That an interpreter will reliably do this allows speakers to intentionally \"flout\" the maxims—i.e., create the appearance of breaking the maxims in a way that is obvious to both speaker and interpreter—to get their implicatures across.\n\nPerhaps Grice's best-known example of conversational implicature is the case of the reference letter, a \"quantity implicature\" (i.e., because it involves flouting the first maxim of Quantity):\n\nA is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a philosophy job, and his letter reads as follows: \"Dear Sir, Mr. X's command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, etc.\" (Gloss: A cannot be opting out, since if he wished to be uncooperative, why write at all? He cannot be unable, through ignorance, to say more, since the man is his pupil; moreover, he knows that more information than this is wanted. He must, therefore, be wishing to impart information that he is reluctant to write down. This supposition is tenable only if he thinks Mr. X is no good at philosophy. This, then, is what he is implicating.) \n\nGiven that a speaker means a given proposition \"p\" by a given utterance, Grice suggests several features which \"p\" must possess to count as a conversational implicature.\n\nNondetachability: \"The implicature is nondetachable insofar as it is not possible to find another way of saying the same thing (or approximately the same thing) which simply lacks the implicature.\"\n\nCancelability: \"...a putative conversational implicature is explicitly cancelable if, to the form of words the utterance of which putatively implicates that \"p\", it is admissible to add \"but not p\", or \"I do not mean to imply that p\", and it is contextually cancelable if one can find situations in which the utterance of the form of words would simply not carry the implicature.\"\n\nNon-Conventionality: \"...conversational implicata are not part of the meaning of the expressions to the employment of which they attach.\"\n\nCalculability: \"The presence of a conversational implicature must be capable of being worked out; for even if it can in fact be intuitively grasped, unless the intuition is replaceable by an argument, the implicature (if present at all) will not count as a conversational implicature; it will be a conventional implicature.\"\n\nGrice also distinguishes between generalised and particularised conversational implicature. Grice says that particularised conversational implicatures (such as in the reference letter case quoted above) arise in \"cases in which an implicature is carried by saying that \"p\" on a particular occasion in virtue of special features about the context, cases in which there is no room for the idea that an implicature of this sort is normally carried by saying that \"p\".\" Generalized implicature, by contrast, arise in cases in which \"one can say that the use of a certain form of words in an utterance would normally (in the absence of special circumstances) carry such-and-such an implicature or type of implicature.\" Grice does not offer a full theory of generalised conversational implicatures that distinguishes them from particularlised conversational implicatures, on one hand, and from conventional implicatures, on the other hand, but later philosophers and linguists have attempted to expand on the idea of generalised conversational implicatures.\n\nIn his book \"Studies in the Way of Words\" (1977?), he presents what he calls \"Grice's Paradox\". In it, he supposes that two chess players, Yog and Zog, play 100 games under the following conditions:\n\n(1) Yog is white nine of ten times.<br>\n(2) There are no draws.\n\nAnd the results are:\n\n(1) Yog, when white, won 80 of 90 games.<br>\n(2) Yog, when black, won zero of ten games.\n\nThis implies that:\n\n(i) 8/9 times, if Yog was white, Yog won.<br>\n(ii) 1/2 of the time, if Yog lost, Yog was black. \n(iii) 9/10 that either Yog wasn't white or he won.\n\nFrom these statements, it might \"appear\" one could make these deductions by contraposition and conditional disjunction:\n\n([a] from [ii]) If Yog was white, then 1/2 of the time Yog won.<br>\n([b] from [iii]) 9/10 times, if Yog was white, then he won.\n\nBut both (a) and (b) are untrue—they contradict (i). In fact, (ii) and (iii) don't provide enough information to use Bayesian reasoning to reach those conclusions. That might be clearer if (i)-(iii) had instead been stated like so:\n\nGrice's paradox shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination.\n\nRelevance theory of Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson builds on and also challenges Grice's theory of meaning and his account of pragmatic inference. See \"Relevance: Communication and Cognition\" (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986).\n\nGrice's work is examined in detail by Stephen Neale, \"Paul Grice and the Philosophy of Language\", \"Linguistics and Philosophy\" 15: 5 (Oct. 1992).\n\n\n\n"}

It was a Formosan language of the Austronesian language family. The last remaining native speaker of Pazeh proper, Pan Jin-yu, died in 2010 at the age of 96. Before her death, she offered Pazeh classes to about 200 regular students in Puli and a small number of students in Miaoli and Taichung. Kulun (sometimes also spelled Kulon) was a dialect that became extinct earlier. The insulting name \"fan\" was used against Plains Aborigines by the Han Taiwanese, and the Hoklo Taiwanese speech was forced upon Aborigines like the Pazeh. Hoklo Taiwanese has replaced Pazeh and driven it to near extinction. Aboriginal status has been requested by Plains Aboriginals.\n\nPazeh has 17 consonants, 4 vowels, and 4 diphthongs (-ay, -aw, -uy, -iw).\n\nAlthough Pazeh contrasts voiced and voiceless obstruents, this contrast is neutralized in final position for labial and velar stops, where only and occur respectively ( is also devoiced but a contrast is maintained). and are also neutralized to the latter. Voiceless stops are unreleased in final position.\n\nMid vowels ( and ) are allophones of close vowels ( and respectively). \n\nThe most common morpheme structure is CVCVC where C is any consonant and V is any vowel. Consonant clusters are rare and consist only of a nasal plus a homorganic obstruent or the glide element of a diphthong.\n\nIntervocalic voiceless stops are voiced before a morpheme boundary (but not following one) . Stress falls on the ultimate syllable.\n\nThe Pazih language merged the following Proto-Austronesian phonemes (Li 2001:7).\n\n\nPazih also split some Proto-Austronesian phonemes:\n\nLike Bunun, Seediq, Squliq Atayal, Mantauran Rukai, and the Tsouic languages, Pazeh does not distinguish between common nouns and personal names, whereas Saisiyat does (Li 2000). Although closely related to Saisiyat, the Pazeh language does not have the infix -um- that is present in Saisiyat.\n\nPazeh makes ready use of affixes, infixes, suffixes, and circumfixes, as well as reduplication. Pazeh also has \"focus-marking\" in its verbal morphology. In addition, verbs can be either stative or dynamic.\n\nThere are four types of focus in Pazeh (Li 2000).\n\nThe following affixes are used in Pazeh verbs (Li 2000).\n\nThe following are also used to mark aspect (Li 2000).\n\nThe Pazih affixes below are from Li (2001:10–19).\n\n\nAlthough originally a verb-initial language, Pazeh often uses SVO (verb-medial) sentence constructions due to influence from Chinese.\n\nThere are four case markers in Pazeh (Li 2000).\n\n\nPazeh has the following negators (Li 2001:46).\n\n\nThe Pazeh personal pronouns below are from Li (2000). (\"Note\": vis. = visible, prox. = proximal)\n\nPazeh and Saisiyat are the only Formosan languages that do not have a bipartite numerical system consisting of both human and non-human numerals (Li 2006). Pazeh is also the only language that forms the numerals 6 to 9 by addition (However, Saisiyat, which is closely related to Pazeh, expresses the number 6 as 5 + 1, and 9 as 10 − 1.)\n\n\nThe number \"five\" in Pazeh, \"xasep\", is similar to Saisiyat \"Laseb\", Taokas \"hasap\", Babuza \"nahup\", and Hoanya \"hasip\" (Li 2006). Li (2006) believes that the similarity is more likely because of borrowing rather than common origin. Laurent Sagart considers these numerals to be ancient retentions from Proto-Austronesian, but Paul Jen-kuei Li considers them to be local innovations. Unlike Pazeh, these Plains Aboriginal languages as well as the Atayalic languages use 2 × 4 to express the number 8. (The Atayalic languages as well as Thao also use 2 × 3 to express the number 6.) Saisiyat, Thao, Taokas, and Babuza use 10 − 1 to express 9, whereas Saisiyat uses 5 + 1 to express 6 as Pazeh does. The Ilongot language of the Philippines also derives numerals in the same manner as Pazeh does (Blust 2009:273).\n\nFurthermore, numerals can function as both nouns and verbs in all Formosan languages, including Pazeh.\n\n\n\n"}

Revoicers generally have excellent skills in auditory phonetic/phonemic pattern recognition, similar to those utilized by a court reporter or stenographer, to identify the sounds of speech (phonemic sounds) of the speaker.\n\nProfessional (compensated) revoicers are requested and utilized by individuals with speech disabilities, and are paid in the same manner as other auxiliary service providers for persons with communication-related disabilities. In the United States, professional revoicers are compensated pursuant to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 3, and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments of 2008.\n\n(1) Professional revoicers are used by individuals with speech disabilities who have normal or near-normal hearing ability; and\n\n(2) Professional DHH revoicers are used by individuals whose speech disabilities were caused by early severe or profound bilateral (both ears) hearing loss who wish to speak in their own words and with their own voices. The professional DHH revoicer is usually highly experienced and is able to function in a dual capacity—acting as a professional revoicer for expressive communications (utilizing lipreading (speechreading) and gestural cues, if necessary), and also acting as a communication assistant for receptive communications (using any method preferred and chosen by the person with the speech disability).\n\nProfessional Revoicers are also used by telephone companies, under the STS Relay System first established by Robert Segalman, Ph.D., who established the nonprofit organization, \"Speech Communication Assistance by Telephone, Inc.\" (SCT). The STS Relay System uses professional revoicers as \"Speech-to-Speech Communication Assistants\"(STS C.A.s). The STS C.A. Revoices the words of the person with a speech disability so that the other person on the call can understand him or her. The STS Relay System is now available at no cost to persons with speech disabilities in many countries. In the United States, the STS Relay System is monitored by the United States Federal Communications Commission, and can be accessed by dialing 711 on any voice telephone and requesting \"STS Relay Service\".\n\nIn some situations, technologies such as \"computerized speech generating devices\" (also known as \"voice synthesizers,\" where a \"computerized voice\" is heard by the listener(s)) are used by some individuals with speech disabilities. However, these systems may not work in some situations, and in other situations, the individual with the speech disability may not be able to effectively utilize these types of devices, due to additional disability difficulties, or in situations where interpersonal spoken communication is rapidly paced.\n\nThe use of revoicing in criminal trials has been compared to the now widely discredited use of other types of facilitated communication, which is believed to have resulted in innocent people being accused of crimes. One concern is focused on the tendency of the revoicer to have some bias in favor of the alleged victims, as many people claiming to be revoicers available for court testimony also have association with victim advocacy groups.\n"}

He attended school at the \"Bezirksschule\"-level in his hometown. From 1962 to 1966, he attended the teacher's seminar in Wettingen, canton Aargau. He worked as a primary school teacher for six years in Aarau, the capital of canton Aargau. In 1970, he worked in a metalworking company.\n\nIn 1972, Blatter began his college education at the University of Zurich in literature and language studies, matriculating after six semesters. In 1974, he was employed as a machinist in the plastics industry. The following year, he completed training for directors of audio plays at the Swiss Broadcast (Schweizer Radio DRS, part of SRG SSR idée suisse).\n\nAfter long stays in Amsterdam and Husum, Blatter finally settled in Zürich as a freelance writer. Currently, he resides in Oberglatt (canton Zurich).\n\nSilvio Blatter mostly writes prose. In his early works, he described every-day life and the monotony of industrial work in a very haunting and detailed manner. The author became known due to his \"Freiamt-Trilogie\" (\"Freiamt trilogy\") comprising the following novels that were published in Blatter's home region that is called \"Freiamt\" (a certain part of Aargau):\n\nThese thick books paint a wide picture of the Freiamt region and its inhabitants. They are realistic family novels. In \"Das sanfte Gesetz\" for example, Blatter portrays four generations of the fictional family Wolf, a family of entrepreneurs. They suffer tragedy. After a car crash, one family member needs leg amputation, another family member is shot by the police and the son loves his young stepmother, who gets pregnant and the reader doesn’t know by whom. In another volume of the trilogy, a little boy observes hand grenades stolen from a small Swiss army depot at a drill ground/shooting range.\n\nBlatter's narrative style is very realistic and modern. He mentions the boy playing Nintendo Game & Watch hand-held games and names of pop songs and singers (Herbert Grönemeyer, Level 42 and others). Even He-Man from Masters of the Universe plays a role. The child discusses religion with a nun and compares He-Man with Jesus, coming to the conclusion that Jesus, who was a \"transformer,\" wouldn’t have a chance against his enemies, when he – after the Christian belief - becomes man in Judgment Day. Man's body was weak because it was of flesh, so Jesus shall stay a roadside granite sculpture.\n\nDespite the realistic style, some of Blatter's books contain a slight trace of everyday magic that Blatter seemingly doesn’t want destroy. In \"Das sanfte Gesetz,\" there is a totemist thinking of Nina, the mysterious nun and the great-grandfather talking to his donkeys, sending light beams into space. Blatter himself sometimes seems to describe life in esoteric terms.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Blatter stopped writing, as he had taken up painting. Since 2000, writing and painting again have the same importance for him.\n\nSilvio Blatter is a member of the Swiss-German PEN Centre (from 1984 to 1986 he was its chairman) and of the club \"Autorinnen und Autoren der Schweiz\".\n\n\nThe literal English translations of the book titles are given in brackets\n\n"}

In modern use it contrasts on the one hand with such concepts as \"migratory\", \"nomadic\", or \"shifting\", and on the other with \"static\" or \"immobile\". The word also is of historical interest in its change of meaning as its usage changed.\n\nIn current usage in fields such as biology, commonly means \"in a particular location or state, but not rigidly so\". Army ant colonies for example are said to be in a \"statary phase\" when they occupy one bivouac for an extended period instead of just overnight. This is as opposed to a \"nomadic phase\", in which they travel and forage practically daily. This does not mean that ant colonies in a statary phase do not move nor even that they do not forage while statary; they often do both, sometimes daily. Correspondingly a colony in a nomadic phase does not travel without rest; it bivouacs for the night. The significance of the terms is that the colonies' behaviour patterns differ radically according to their activity phase; one pattern favours maintaining a persistent presence where brood is being raised, whereas the other favours continual nomadic wandering into new foraging grounds. Such phases have raised interest in studies in aspects of comparative psychology and evolution.\n\nThe term \"statary\" also applies in contexts other than ants or colonial organisms. Swarm-forming species of locusts go beyond having statary and nomadic phases of behaviour; their growing nymphs actually develop into different adult morphologies, depending on whether the conditions during their growth favour swarming or not. Locusts that adopt the swarming morphology are said to be the migratory morphs, while the rest are called statary morphs. Effectively similar morphs occur in some other insect species, such as army worm.\n\nIn some technical fields \"statary\" need not refer literally to location or motion, but refer figuratively to their having particular characteristic but non-rigid attributes, such as atmospheric pressure. The following section instances examples of such senses occurring in the history of the term.\n\nStatary, from the Latin root \"statarius\", meaning \"standing fast\", first came into prominent use in the English language in \"Positions\", the work of Richard Mulcaster in the sixteenth century. He spoke of \"statarie substance\" much as, in contemporary English, one might speak of fixed assets or fixed property: \"...either rich or poore : landed or unlanded, which is either the having or wanting of the most statarie substance.\" It is unclear whether he coined the English version of the word.\n\nSamuel Collins also used the word \"statary\" in the slightly different sense of \"ordinary\" or \"normal\" in his 1617 defence of the Bishop of Elie, Lancelot Andrewes: \"What is this [in comparison], ... not ... to their stately, but even statarie and ordinarie supremacie in the Church?\".\n\nIn his \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\" Sir Thomas Browne used the word in at least two senses; firstly he used it as meaning \"fixed\" or \"regular\", as in \"...perturbed the observation of festivities and statary solemnities...\" secondly he used it in contrast to \"anniversary\" (by which he meant \"annual\" or \"seasonal\") as in: \"...we might expect a regularity in the winds ; whereof though some be statary, some anniversary, and the rest do tend to determine points of heaven, yet do the blasts and undulary breaths thereof maintain no certainty in their course...\" In this passage he explicitly does not assert the self-contradiction that winds might be static, but rather that they are unceasing, though variable. In this sense Browne's usage is consistent with the modern technical application.\n\nThe word \"statary\" appeared in sundry works after Browne's time, for example in the Literary Gazette in the \"Meteorological Journal\", the word was used in reference to winds and barometric readings in much the same sense as that in which Browne had referred to statary winds.\n\nLancelot Addison referred to \"statary prayers\" in his account of his seven years in West Barbary, published in 1671. However, the word never seems to have come into common use, though it did appear in various dictionaries, such as Samuel Johnson's 1755 Dictionary of the English Language. Such entries did not generally refer to any distinction between the various senses, and in fact some used words such as \"stationary\" in their definitions, apparently feeling no need for a separate term for the concept of something that has a non-rigid general location around specific coordinates. Accordingly the word was marked as obsolete by the compilers of the Oxford English Dictionary published in the late 19th to early 20th century, and Webster's Dictionary did likewise in the 1913 unabridged edition. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in turn omitted the entry altogether. If it had not been resurrected in the role of a technical term, the word \"statary\" probably would have disappeared from the language by now. In the sense of \"rigidly stationary\" it patently is redundant, but in the sense of loosely remaining at particular coordinates, it fills a need in certain fields such as in biology and climatology.\n\nA related sense appeared in the 1623 translation of Xenophon by John Bingham. As applied to soldiers, statary means: equipped for stationary combat as opposed to skirmishing.\n\nEventually, about the early 1930s, the word began to reappear in articles and textbooks, particularly on biological topics. For example, it was used in a prominent textbook of the day, Norman Maier and associates were applying the concept to ant behaviour; it seems that T. C. Schneirla had elected to use the term in 1932. It had proved useful, and by the end of the 20th century the word was in fairly common use, as can be seen from Google Ngram Viewer.\n"}

{"id": "3458337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3458337", "title": "Zionides", "text": "Zionides\n\nThe songs of Zion (), \"i.e.\", the lyrical hymns which express the longing of the Jewish nation to see the hill of Zion and the city of Jerusalem shine again in all their former glory, date back to the time immediately after the destruction of Solomon's Temple. Since that period the poets and singers of Israel have devoted their best talent to painting in the most brilliant colors the ancient glories of Zion. \n\nBy far the greater number of these songs unite in voicing a heartfelt desire to see the nation, the city of Jerusalem, Mount Zion, and the Temple restored to their former splendor.\n\nThe oldest song of Zion in Jewish literature was written in the fifth century B.C., and is a lamentation that the enemy compels Israel to live on foreign soil; this is the celebrated Psalm cxxxvii. 1-3. A similar Zionide of the same period is Ps. cxxvi.; in it the poet, full of hope, sings of the day when the Captivity shall be over and the joyfully returning exiles shall sing a new song of Zion. The elegy ending with a desire for deliverance, which is found in the fifth chapter of Lamentations, dates probably from the first pre-Christian century.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Zionides from the pens of the greatest poets formed the chief comfort and consolation of the people. As early as the time of Ibn Gabirol (11th century) songs of Zion were incorporated in the liturgy, partly as lamentations for the Ninth of Ab and partly as tefillot and piyyut'im. Among the songs of lamentation for Zion which are sung on the Ninth of Ab the following may be specially referred to: a song beginning with the words ' and giving a vivid description of the destruction of Zion; the well-known song which begins with the words ', and in which Samaria and Jerusalem try to excel each other in the description of the misfortune which has fallen upon them; and, above all, the song with the refrain:\n\nand several strophes of the song \"Lekah Dodi\", composed by Solomon ha-Levi and incorporated in the Sabbath eve service.\n\nThe most important of Ibn Gabirol's Zionides are the poem beginning with the words:\n\nJudah ha-Levi (1140) was the author of the Zionide beginning:\n\n\"Zion, wilt thou not send a greeting to thy captives, Who greet thee as the remnant of thy flocks? From West to East, from North to South, a greeting, From far and near, take thou on all sides. A greeting sends the captive of desire, who sheds his tears Like dew on Hermon; would they might fall on thy hills.\"\n\nBesides this song, which has been translated into nearly all European languages in prose and in verse, Judah wrote several shorter songs, chief of which are \"(\"My heart is in the East, although I am at the end of the West\")\" and \n\nAmong other medieval writers of this class may be mentioned Abraham ibn Ezra, who composed the Zionide \"(\"O God, who art enthroned in the East, appease the mourning dove\")\"; Judah al-Ḥarizi (13th century), author of the song (\"Peace be to the city of Salem Jerusalem\"); and Israel Najara (16th century), who wrote the song \"(\"May the flower of salvation bloom like a palm\")\". \n\nIn more modern times Samuel David Luzzatto wrote:\n\nEqually well known is Joseph Almanzi's\n\nThe most prominent Hebrew poets have written Zionides, among the number being M. S. Rabener, Micah Levisohn, Judah Loeb Gordon, S. Mandelkern, M. M. Dolitzky, and N. H. Imber. \nCountless songs have been produced under the influence of Zionism: of these may be mentioned the song adopted by all the Zionists of the world as their national song, and beginning with the words \"There, where a slender cedar kisses the clouds\"; the song of the academic society Kadimah in Austria, \"Knowest thou whence freedom comes\"?; \nthe song of the united Zionists, \"Sluchajcie bracia gueśni tij\"; and \"hatTiqwah\" (Hope), composed by N. H. Imber, which has the refrain:\n\n"}
