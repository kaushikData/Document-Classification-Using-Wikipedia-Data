His overwhelming interest, however, lay in theatre and he faced parental pressure for his continued disinterest in formal education. His father pressurised him to return to his native Belgaum.\n\nTo support himself, Kirloskar then worked for eight years as a school teacher in Belgaum; he subsequently worked for a few years in the police department and then as a clerk in the revenue commissioner's office. Despite his lack of much formal education, Kirloskar was well-versed in Sanskrit literature.\n\nIn 1843, the same year in which Kirloskar's was born, Vishnudas Bhave pioneered presentation of Marathi plays by staging the play \"Seeta Swayamwar\" (सीतास्वयंवर), the Raja of the princely state of Sangli being then in attendance among the audience.\n\nWhile working as a school teacher in Belgaum, Kirloskar established \"Bharatshastrottejak Mandali\" (भरतशास्त्रोत्तेजक मंडळी) in 1866. Seven years later, he completed composition of his first prose play \"Shri Shankar Digvijay\" (श्रीशांकर दिग्विजय) for public presentation by \"Kolhapurkar Natak Mandali\" (कोल्हापूर नाटक मंडळी). Around 1874, he founded \"Kirloskar Natak Mandali\" (किर्लोस्कर नाटक मंडळी).\n\nIn 1879, playwright and producer Trilokekar independently presented his musical play \"Nal-Damayanti\" (नल-दमयंती) to Marathi public. It was the first musical play on Marathi stage.\n\nKirloskar felt inspired to produce a similar musical play in Marathi in a full-fledged manner. Accordingly, translating into Marathi the first four acts of Kalidas's renowned Sanskrit play \"Abhidnyan Shakuntalam\" or \"Abhijñānashākuntala\" (अभिज्ञानशाकुंतलं), he presented them on stage in 1880 as a musical play titled \"Shakuntal\" (शाकुंतल).\n\nThe next year, he translated the remaining three acts of \"Abhidnyan Shakuntalam\" and staged the entire play. He performed in the play himself.\n\nKirloskar incredibly included 198 musical pieces in his Marathi \"Shakuntal\". They consisted of a mix of Hindustani and Carnatic classical music, and lighter music.\n\nOne year later, in 1882, Kirloskar presented on stage his musical \"Saubhadra\" (सौभद्र). This play too contained well over 100 musical pieces, and once again he acted in the play.\n\nBecause of its multifaceted quality, \"Saubhadra\" surpassed even the high popularity of \"Shakuntal\". Innumerable performances of these two plays have been presented by different performing groups to the Marathi audience since their premiere 130 years ago.\n\nIn 1884, Kirloskar presented to the audience the first three acts of his musical \"Ram Rajya Wiyog\". Before he could finish writing the planned remaining three acts of this play, he died in 02 NOVEMBAR 1885 at age 42.\n\n\"Kirloskar Natak Mandali\" founded by Anna Saheb in 1880 was the pioneer and breakthrough performing company in Marathi theater. It was the prime performing company in Marathi language until 1913. After Kirloskar's death, it presented plays of Govind Ballal Deval and Shripad Krushna Kolhatkar besides Kirloskar's \"Shakuntal\" and \"Saubhadra\". It toured through Maharashtra, Karnataka and Maratha princely states in North India under the British Raj at that time - Indore, Baroda, Gwalior etc.The \"Mandali\" had several star singer-actors in its employ, including Bal Gandharva, Govindrao Tembe, Master Krushnarao, and Ganesh Bodas.\n\n\"Kirloskar Natak Mandali\" folded around 1935.\n\nBal Gandharva's \"Gandharva Natak Mandali\"; Vasudeorao Dongre's \"Dongre Mandali\"; Pandoba Gurav Yavateshwarkar's \"Waikar Sangeet Mandali\"; Janubhau Nimkar and Keshavrao Bhosale's \"Swadesh-Hita-Chintak Mandali\", which evolved into \"Lalit-Kaladarsha Mandali\"; and Master Dinanath's \"Balwant Natak Mandali\" were the other main performing companies which were formed in Maharashtra after 1913.\n\n"}
{"id": "2399303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2399303", "title": "Babm", "text": "Babm\n\nBabm (pronounced ) is an international auxiliary language created by the Japanese philosopher Rikichi [Fuishiki] Okamoto (1885–1963). Okamoto first published the language in his 1962 book, The Simplest Universal Auxiliary Language Babm, but the language has not caught on even within the constructed language community, and does not have any known current speakers.The language uses the Latin script as a syllabary, and possesses no articles or auxiliary verbs. Each letter marks an entire syllable rather than a single phoneme. Babm follows a sound-based rule set, which Okamoto outlines in his book. He states \"Nouns are coined from three consonants and one vowel, verbs from one or two vowels between two consonants at the beginning and at the end. Adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, numerals, and propositions have respectively their own peculiar form.\" \n\nThe language has in common with some 17th-century artificial languages an over-riding concern with taxonomy, and providing a universally consistent set of names for chemicals, etc.; the author's \"scientific\" preoccupation is a contrast to the socio-political mandate of Esperanto, although the 1962 book is certainly not lacking in statements about world peace. Okamoto hoped this \"simple\" language would become universally useful. \n\nEvery consonant in Babm must be followed by a particular short vowel, with the exception of /k/ which can be followed by any vowel. Vowels that are attached to nouns are short vowels by default, and those not attached to nouns are long, but vowel length can be modified. Because of this, words have a basic CV structure with some vowel clusters but no consonant clusters.\n\nOkamoto provides limited information about the syntax, stating that \"it is rather desirable that it [the sentence] be free from many rules of composition.\" The word order is SVO, with modifiers preceding the elements they modify.\n\nThe language exhibits some degree of analytic inflection: In sentences with complex structures, the subject, the direct object, and the indirect object can be distinguished through preceding \"prepositional conjunctions.\" There is also a set of auxiliary-like elements that Okamoto terms \"executive complements,\" which modify the verb in various ways and may occur either as suffixes or as separate words preceding the verb.\n\nOkamoto's book provides a detailed dictionary, split up into a number of sections. In his text, Okamoto splits nouns up into nine sections: \"Living Things\", \"Material Bodies\", \"Chemical Terms\", \"Expendables and Materials\", \"Durable Goods\", \"Human Body and Physiology\", \"\"Conscious Actions\", \"Structure of Living\", and \"Politics\". Each of these sections is split into a number of sub-sections. The other parts of speech further split into smaller sections in the book are Verbs, Complements and Prepositional Conjunctions. Okamoto also includes a section for \"Abridged Common Expressions\" such as \"Good evening!\" and \"Congratulations!\" \n\nIn order to keep the language simple, Babm does not have articles or auxiliary verbs, and avoids the inflection of a basic word.\n\nAs a rule, 4 letters make up a noun. Nouns have an initial short-sound letter which indicates meaning, usually followed by a long-sound letter which is pronounced long and with a strong accent. The third letter is also usually short-sound, and it indicates the sort of noun divided by meaning, although it can be long-sound as well. The final letter is also short-sound, and it specifies the noun. If a noun has two long-sound letters in the middle, the first is accentuated. Proper nouns should follow these guidelines, however one long-sound or one short-sound letter may be added before or after the word. \"c, lr,\" and \"qw\" are not permitted to be noun-initial, and \"l\" and \"w\" are avoided at the end of nouns. \n\nExample nouns include \"babm\" (a universal language) and \"rboit\" (mother and father).\n\nVerbs have either 3 or 4 letters. They must start with a short-sound letter which indicates meaning and end with a short-sound letter. There can be one or two long-sound letters in the middle. One long-sound letter and the final short-sound letter correspond with their similar-sounding noun counterpart. On rare occasions, verbs may have three long-sound letters. The first long-sound letter and the third long-sound letter (if present) are accentually pronounced and the final short-sound letter is pronounced slightly strongly and distinctly. \n\nExample: \"bean\"\n\nComplements have less than three letters and are conducted by \"c\". The complement is an adjective when modifying a noun or pronoun and an adverb when qualifying any other word. The suffix \"-w\" may also be added to adverbs to make it clearer. They generally end with a short-sound letter. \"l\" and \"w\" are avoided at the end of complements. Example: cefd (white)\n\nPronouns have four classes: personal pronoun, impersonal pronoun, relative pronoun, and interrogative pronoun. \n\nPersonal and impersonal pronouns:\nRelative pronouns are based on \"lr\", and interrogative pronouns are based on \"qw.\" Both of these are used as the subject or object. The beginning short-sound letter and the first long-sound letter are accented, and other long-sound letters are pronounced somewhat strongly and distinctly with a pause.\n\nThe prepositional conjunction is one letter, \"a\". It usually accompanies one or two long-sound letters before or after one short-sound letter and may be placed before any word, clause, or sentence. \n\nExclamations are two long-sounding letters and \"w\" may be added to the middle or end. \n\nBabm utilizes prefixes and suffixes to modify nouns, verbs, complements, and pronouns. \n\nBabm uses the Latin alphabet with 26 letters. Each letter of the alphabet represents said letter plus a short vowel. Written vowels represent long vowels. The consonant and vowel inventories are as follows:\n\n[Babm:] V pajio ci htaj, lrid cga coig pegayx pe bamb ak cop pbagt.\n\n[English:] \"I am reading this book, which is very interestingly written in Babm by a predominant scholar.\"\n\n[Babm:] Dedh cjis beg kobp.\n\n[English:] \"Time causes youth to be old.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7889619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7889619", "title": "Burning off", "text": "Burning off\n\nIn broadcast programming, burning off is the airing of otherwise-abandoned television programs, usually by scheduling in far less important time slots, moving shows to less-important sister networks, or taking extensive hiatuses.\n\nAbandoned programs may be burned off for a number of reasons: \n\nUp through the 1990s, this often meant the airing of pilots for shows that were not going to be picked up, such as \"The Art of Being Nick\", \"Poochinski\", \"Heart and Soul\", and \"Barney Miller\", usually during the summer months to provide some form of new programming in the technical sense of the word. In a few cases, the pilot may prove popular enough that a series is eventually commissioned; such was the case with \"Barney Miller\" and \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\", the latter of which led to the long-running sitcom \"Seinfeld\". Anthology series such as \"Love, American Style\" were devoted to many such failed pilots.\n\nSince the late 1990s, episodes of long-running shows that are no longer hits and have been taken off the schedule have been burned off. \"The Drew Carey Show\" is an example of a series whose entire final season was burned off (the series' ninth season aired on ABC in the summer of 2004). In many cases, instead of airing the episodes during the regular television season, the episodes are held back and presented during the summer months to fulfill the network's obligation to air them and to produce at least some return on their investment. Another example occurs in 1997 when the remaining \"EZ Streets\" episodes aired on CBS, after its October 1996 cancellation. Yet another example of these is burned off episodes from the second season of \"Max Headroom\". Recent examples of summer burn-offs include Fox's \"Sons of Tucson\" (2010) and the NBC medical/fantasy drama \"Do No Harm\" (2013).\n\nSome programs may not air even in this form; in 2010, the final unaired episodes of the seldom-promoted ABC workplace comedy \"Better Off Ted\" were to be used solely as a filler just in case the 2010 NBA Finals ended after five games. However, the Finals were a full seven-game series, and the remaining episodes of \"Better Off Ted\" would not premiere until the release of the series' second season DVD box set and eventual streaming on Netflix.\n\nIn one of the earliest examples of a burning-off, Milton Berle, then in the middle of a 30-year contract witn NBC, was installed as host of the show \"Jackpot Bowling\" when Berle, who was one of television's first major stars but was rapidly fading in the face of new competition, could no longer draw enough viewers to headline a variety show of his own. The experiment failed after six months, and NBC finally terminated his contract in 1961.\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Fox aired 37 first-run episodes of the sitcom \"'Til Death\": 22 season four episodes and 15 unaired episodes from season three. The series had been renewed for a fourth season only after Sony Pictures Television offered Fox a discount on the licensing fee in order to get enough episodes aired to compile a saleable syndication package. Several episodes of the series were burned off in unusual time slots, including: four episodes in a Christmas Day \"marathon\", two episodes being aired against Super Bowl XLIV, and three unaired third season episodes being broadcast in June after the fourth season (and series) finale had already aired in May.\n\nOther examples include in television syndication, having a station pick up one program solely to air another, as was the case in 2009 when a syndicator offered stripped repeats of MTV's \"\" which were of little interest to viewers or the stations themselves, but eventually led into the more popular MTV series \"The Hills\", which was part of the same package. In the reverse, shows such as \"The Golden Girls\" and \"Three's Company\" have had their spin-offs (in the mentioned cases, \"The Golden Palace\" and \"Three's a Crowd\") bundled together due to the strong continuity between the original series and the spin-off.\n\nOften, the program is moved to a sister cable network into low-profile time slots to mute collateral damage to the main broadcast's schedule as much as possible. Such was the case with NBC's broadcast airing of the MySpace series \"Quarterlife\", the ABC pageant reality series \"All American Girl\" and ABC's \"Greg Behrendt's Wake Up Call\". In these cases, \"Quarterlife\" aired in the form of a one-day marathon on Bravo, while \"All American Girl\" was placed on ABC Family. In the case of \"Wake Up Call\", the show never aired on ABC due to several factors, including the failure of Berhendt's self-titled talk show during the same season, and a glut of reality series during the 2006–07 summer season. The program was held up until January 2009, when it had a short run on ABC's SoapNet. In 2011, Fox similarly dumped the canceled sitcom \"Running Wilde\" on sister channel FX after a short burn-off run on the network's late night Saturday lineup; FX consigned the show to four different time slots during the burn off. \n\nNickelodeon often uses its sister networks TeenNick and Nicktoons to burn off series that failed on Nickelodeon, or to air acquired programming from its international sister networks which contractually require a minimum American run (the \"Oggy and the Cockroaches\", a show popular in its home European market but mediocre in American airings on Fox Family and Nickelodeon, is an example of this; it was removed from Nickelodeon and burned off in low-viewed Nicktoons timeslots as fast as possible due to light parental controversy involving unnoticed background comical nudity in an episode).\n\nSimilarly, Cartoon Network sometimes moves programming to Boomerang, airing acquired programming not fitting Cartoon Network's current programming direction (such as \"Grojband\" and \"The Garfield Show\"), and also airing episodes of some of Cartoon Network's acquired shows before they aired on Cartoon Network (such as \"Johnny Test\" and \"Peanuts\"). Original Cartoon Network programming moving to Boomerang while still in original production is much rarer than it is for Nickelodeon's networks (especially as Boomerang has less distribution than Nickelodeon's secondary networks), and Cartoon Network will usually burn off episodes on their network to provide closure to viewers. As the networks of Disney Channel are separated by age and gender (Disney XD has a young male focus, while Disney Junior is meant for young children), that network rarely directs little-watched programming to another network and instead merely downgrades series to lower-profile timeslots.\n\nAnother case involving cable television had the final five episodes of Syfy's \"Caprica\" being burned off on January 4, 2011 after the network determined that it would neither renew the series nor be able to support a traditional finale due to scheduling factors.\n\nIn March 2014, the A&E series \"Those Who Kill\" was moved to Lifetime Movie Network after A&E canceled the show following two low-rated episodes.\n\n"}

However, both languages have typological oddities: Chemakum had no simple velar consonants, and Quileute has no nasal consonants.\n\nThe (pre-)Proto-Chimakuan sound system contained three vowels, long and short, and lexical stress.

Open syllables developed long vowels.

{"id": "48684895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48684895", "title": "Electricity price forecasting", "text": "Electricity price forecasting\n\nElectricity price forecasting (EPF) is a branch of energy forecasting which focuses on predicting the spot and forward prices in wholesale electricity markets. Over the last 15 years electricity price forecasts have become a fundamental input to energy companies’ decision-making mechanisms at the corporate level.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the process of deregulation and the introduction of competitive electricity markets have been reshaping the landscape of the traditionally monopolistic and government-controlled power sectors. Throughout Europe, North America and Australia, electricity is now traded under market rules using spot and derivative contracts. However, electricity is a very special commodity: it is economically non-storable and power system stability requires a constant balance between production and consumption. At the same time, electricity demand depends on weather (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, etc.) and the intensity of business and everyday activities (on-peak vs. off-peak hours, weekdays vs. weekends, holidays, etc.). These unique characteristics lead to price dynamics not observed in any other market, exhibiting daily, weekly and often annual seasonality and abrupt, short-lived and generally unanticipated price spikes.\n\nExtreme price volatility, which can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of any other commodity or financial asset, has forced market participants to hedge not only volume but also price risk. Price forecasts from a few hours to a few months ahead have become of particular interest to power portfolio managers. A power market company able to forecast the volatile wholesale prices with a reasonable level of accuracy can adjust its bidding strategy and its own production or consumption schedule in order to reduce the risk or maximize the profits in day-ahead trading. A ballpark estimate of savings from a 1% reduction in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of short-term price forecasts is $300,000 per year for a utility with 1GW peak load.\n\nA variety of methods and ideas have been tried for EPF over the last 15 years, with varying degrees of success. They can be broadly classified into six groups.\n\n\"Multi-agent\" (\"multi-agent simulation\"\", equilibrium, game theoretic\") models simulate the operation of a system of heterogeneous agents (generating units, companies) interacting with each other, and build the price process by matching the demand and supply in the market. This class includes \"cost-based models\" (or \"production-cost models\", PCM), \"equilibrium\" or \"game theoretic\" approaches (like the Nash-Cournot framework, supply function equilibrium - SFE, strategic production-cost models - SPCM) and agent-based models.\n\nMulti-agent models generally focus on qualitative issues rather than quantitative results. They may provide insights as to whether or not prices will be above marginal costs, and how this might influence the players’ outcomes. However, they pose problems if more quantitative conclusions have to be drawn, particularly if electricity prices have to be predicted with a high level of precision.\n\n\"Fundamental\" (\"structural\") methods try to capture the basic physical and economic relationships which are present in the production and trading of electricity. The functional associations between fundamental drivers (loads, weather conditions, system parameters, etc.) are postulated, and the fundamental inputs are modeled and predicted independently, often via statistical, reduced-form or computational intelligence techniques. In general, two subclasses of fundamental models can be identified: \"parameter rich models\" and \"parsimonious structural models\" of supply and demand.\n\nTwo major challenges arise in the practical implementation of fundamental models: data availability and incorporation of stochastic fluctuations of the fundamental drivers. In building the model, we make specific assumptions about physical and economic relationships in the marketplace, and therefore the price projections generated by the models are very sensitive to violations of these assumptions.\n\n\"Reduced-form\" (\"quantitative, stochastic\") models characterize the statistical properties of electricity prices over time, with the ultimate objective of derivatives valuation and risk management. Their main intention is not to provide accurate hourly price forecasts, but rather to replicate the main characteristics of daily electricity prices, like marginal distributions at future time points, price dynamics, and correlations between commodity prices. If the price process chosen is not appropriate for capturing the main properties of electricity prices, the results from the model are likely to be unreliable. However, if the model is too complex, the computational burden will prevent its use on-line in trading departments. Depending on the type of market under consideration, reduced-form models can be classified as:\n\n\"Statistical\" (\"econometric, technical analysis\") methods forecast the current price by using a mathematical combination of the previous prices and/or previous or current values of exogenous factors, typically consumption and production figures, or weather variables. The two most important categories are \"additive\" and \"multiplicative\" models. They differ in whether the predicted price is the sum (additive) of a number of components or the product (multiplicative) of a number of factors. The former are far more popular, but the two are closely related - a multiplicative model for prices can be transformed into an additive model for log-prices. Statistical models are attractive because some physical interpretation may be attached to their components, thus allowing engineers and system operators to understand their behavior. They are often criticized for their limited ability to model the (usually) nonlinear behavior of electricity prices and related fundamental variables. However, in practical applications, their performances are not worse than those of the non-linear computational intelligence methods (see below). For instance, in the \"load forecasting track\" of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2012) attracting hundreds of participants worldwide, the top four winning entries used regression-type models.\n\nStatistical models constitute a very rich class which includes:\n\n\"Computational intelligence\" (\"artificial intelligence-based, machine learning, non-parametric, non-linear statistical\") techniques combine elements of learning, evolution and fuzziness to create approaches that are capable of adapting to complex dynamic systems, and may be regarded as \"intelligent\" in this sense. Artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems and support vector machines (SVM) are unquestionably the main classes of computational intelligence techniques in EPF. Their major strength is the ability to handle complexity and non-linearity. In general, computational intelligence methods are better at modeling these features of electricity prices than the statistical techniques (see above). At the same time, this flexibility is also their major weakness. The ability to adapt to nonlinear, spiky behaviors will not necessarily result in better point or probabilistic forecasts.\n\nMany of the modeling and price forecasting approaches considered in the literature are \"hybrid\" solutions, combining techniques from two or more of the groups listed above. Their classification is non-trivial, if possible at all.\nAs an example of hybrid model AleaModel (AleaSoft) combines Neural Networks and Box Jenkins models.\n\nIt is customary to talk about short-, medium- and long-term forecasting, but there is no consensus in the literature as to what the thresholds should actually be:\n\nIn his extensive review paper, Weron looks ahead and speculates on the directions EPF will or should take over the next decade or so:\n\nA key point in electricity spot price modeling and forecasting is the appropriate treatment of seasonality. And it should be emphasized that the electricity price exhibits seasonality at three levels: the daily and weekly, and to some extent - the annual. In \"short-term forecasting\", the annual or long-term seasonality is usually ignored, but the daily and weekly patterns (including a separate treatment of holidays) are of prime importance. This, however, may not be the right approach. As Nowotarski and Weron have recently shown, decomposing a series of electricity prices into a long-term seasonal and a stochastic component, modeling them independently and combining their forecasts can bring - contrary to a common belief - an accuracy gain compared to an approach in which a given model is calibrated to the prices themselves. \n\nIn \"mid-term forecasting\", the daily patterns become less relevant and most EPF models work with average daily prices. However, the long-term trend-cycle component plays a crucial role. Its misspecification can introduce bias, which may lead to a bad estimate of the mean reversion level or of the price spike intensity and severity, and consequently, to underestimating the risk. Finally, in the \"long term\", when the time horizon is measured in years, the daily, weekly and even annual seasonality may be ignored, and long-term trends dominate. Adequate treatment - both in-sample and out-of-sample - of seasonality has not been given enough attention in the literature so far. \n\nAnother crucial issue in electricity price forecasting is the appropriate choice of explanatory variables. Apart from historical electricity prices, the current spot price is dependent on a large set of fundamental drivers, including system loads, weather variables, fuel costs, the reserve margin (i.e., available generation minus/over predicted demand) and information about scheduled maintenance and forced outages. Although \"pure price\" models are sometimes used for EPF, in the most common day-ahead forecasting scenario most authors select a combination of these fundamental drivers, based on the heuristics and experience of the forecaster. Very rarely has an automated selection or shrinkage procedure been carried out in EPF, especially for a large set of initial explanatory variables. However, the machine learning literature provides viable tools that can be broadly classified into two categories:\nSome of these techniques have been utilized in the context of EPF:\nbut their use is not common. Further development and employment of methods for selecting the most effective input variables - from among the past electricity prices, as well as the past and predicted values of the fundamental drivers - is needed.\n\nWhen predicting spike occurrences or spot price volatility, one of the most influential fundamental variables is the reserve margin, also called surplus generation. It relates the available capacity (generation, supply), formula_1, to the demand (load), formula_2, at a given moment in time formula_3. The traditional engineering notion of the reserve margin defines it as the difference between the two, i.e., formula_4, but many authors prefer to work with dimensionless ratios formula_5, formula_6 or the so-called capacity utilization formula_7. Its rare application in EPF can be justified only by the difficulty of obtaining good quality reserve margin data. Given that more and more system operators (see e.g. http://www.elexon.co.uk) are disclosing such information nowadays, reserve margin data should be playing a significant role in EPF in the near future.\n\nThe use of prediction intervals (PI) and densities, or probabilistic forecasting, has become much more common over the past three decades, as practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts. Despite the bold move by the organizers of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 to require the participants to submit forecasts of the 99 percentiles of the predictive distribution (day-ahead in the price track) and not the point forecasts as in the 2012 edition, this does not seem to be a common case in EPF as yet.\n\nIf PIs are computed at all, they usually are distribution-based (and approximated by the standard deviation of the model residuals) or empirical. The latter method resembles the estimation of the Value-at-Risk via historical simulation, and consists of computing sample quantiles of the empirical distribution of the one-step-ahead prediction errors. A new forecast combination (see below) technique has been introduced recently in the context of EPF. Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) involves applying quantile regression to the point forecasts of a small number of individual forecasting models or experts, hence allows to leverage existing development of point forecasting.\n\nConsensus forecasts, also known as \"combining forecasts\", \"forecast averaging\" or \"model averaging\" (in econometrics and statistics) and \"committee machines\", \"ensemble averaging\" or \"expert aggregation\" (in machine learning), are predictions of the future that are created by combining together several separate forecasts which have often been created using different methodologies. Despite their popularity in econometrics, averaged forecasts have not been used extensively in the context of electricity markets to date. There is some limited evidence on the adequacy of combining forecasts of electricity demand, but it was only very recently that combining was used in EPF and only for point forecasts. Combining probabilistic (i.e., interval and density) forecasts is much less popular, even in econometrics in general, mainly because of the increased complexity of the problem. Since Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) allows to leverage existing development of point forecasting, it is particularly attractive from a practical point of view and may become a popular tool in EPF in the near future.\n\nThe literature on forecasting daily electricity prices has concentrated largely on models that use only information at the aggregated (i.e., daily) level. On the other hand, the very rich body of literature on forecasting intra-day prices has used disaggregated data (i.e., hourly or half-hourly), but generally has not explored the complex dependence structure of the multivariate price series. If we want to explore the structure of intra-day electricity prices, we need to use dimension reduction methods; for instance, factor models with factors estimated as principal components (PC). Empirical evidence indicates that there are forecast improvements from incorporating disaggregated (i.e., hourly or zonal) data for predicting daily system prices, especially when the forecast horizon exceeds one week. With the increase of computational power, the real-time calibration of these complex models will become feasible and we may expect to see more EPF applications of the multivariate framework in the coming years.\n\nAll major review publications conclude that there are problems with comparing the methods developed and used in the EPF literature. This is due mainly to the use of different datasets, different software implementations of the forecasting models and different error measures, but also to the lack of statistical rigor in many studies. This calls for a comprehensive, thorough study involving (i) the same datasets, (ii) the same robust error evaluation procedures, and (iii) statistical testing of the significance of one model's outperformance of another. To some extent, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 has addressed these issues. Yet more has to be done. A selection of the better-performing measures (weighted-MAE, seasonal MASE or RMSSE) should be used either exclusively or in conjunction with the more popular ones (MAPE, RMSE). The empirical results should be further tested for the significance of the differences in forecasting accuracies of the models.\n\n"}

{"id": "24106558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24106558", "title": "Endurance running hypothesis", "text": "Endurance running hypothesis\n\nThe endurance running hypothesis is the hypothesis that the evolution of certain human characteristics can be explained as adaptations to long distance running. The hypothesis suggests that endurance running played an important role for early hominins in obtaining food. Researchers have proposed that endurance running began as an adaptation for scavenging and later for persistence hunting.\n\nMuch research has been geared towards the mechanics of how bipedal walking has evolved in the genus \"Homo\". However, little research has been conducted to examine how the specific adaptations for running emerged, and how they influenced human evolution.\n\nThe bit of research that has focused on human running provides much evidence for bodily function and structures that improve running only, and are not used in walking. This suggests that running was an adaptation, not that it came about as a byproduct of walking.\n\nRunning and walking incorporated different biomechanisms. Walking requires an \"inverted pendulum\" where the body's center of mass is shifted over the extended leg, to exchange potential and kinetic energy with each step. Running involves a \"mass spring\" mechanism to exchange potential and kinetic energy, with the use of tendons and ligaments. Tendons and ligaments are elastic tissues that store energy. They are stretched and then release energy as they recoil. This mass spring mechanism becomes less energetically costly at faster speeds and is therefore more efficient than the inverted pendulum of walking mechanics when traveling at greater speeds. Tendons and ligaments, however, do not provide these benefits in walking.\n\nAlthough the mass spring mechanism can be more energetically favorable at higher speeds, it also results in an increase in ground reaction forces and is less stable because there is more movement and pitching of the limbs and core of the body. Ground forces and body pitching movement is less of an issue in the walking gait, where the position of the body's center of mass varies less, making walking an inherently more stable gait. In response to the destabilization of the running gait, the human body appears to have evolved adaptations to increase stabilization, as well as for the mass-spring mechanism in general. These adaptations, described below, are all evidence for selection for endurance running.\n\nMany researchers compare the skeletal structures of early hominins such as \"Australopithecus\" to those of \"Homo\" in order to identify structural differences that may be significant to endurance running.\n\nNuchal ligament: Because the head is decoupled from the shoulders, early \"Homo\" needed a way to stabilize the head. The nuchal ligament is an important evolved feature in head stabilization. It starts at the midline of the occiput and connects to the upper trapezius. This ligament is also important in terms of archaeological findings, because it leaves a small indentation and ridge in the skull, allowing researchers to see if various species had a nuchal ligament. The ability to see traces of ligaments in archaeological findings is rare because they degrade quickly and often leave no trace. In the case of the nuchal ligament, a trace of its existence is left with the presence of the skull ridge. Because neither \"Australopithecus\" nor \"Pan\" had the skull ridge, it has been concluded that this feature is unique to \"Homo\". Because the nuchal ligament is only activated while running, the amount of running can be inferred from the muscle markings. In the case of Homo Erectus and Neanderthals, very strong nuchal ligament markings are present, but are less marked in modern humans, indicating a decrease in running behavior \n\nShoulder and head stabilization: The human skeleton is different from early hominins as there is less of a connection between the pectoral girdle parts of the shoulders and upper back and head, which would be advantageous for climbing but would hinder the movements of the upper body needed to counter leg movement and therefore stabilize the body and head when running. This stabilization is unnecessary in walking.\n\nLimb length and mass: \"Homo\" has longer legs relative to body mass, which helps to decrease the energetic costs of running, as time in contact with the ground increases. There is also a decrease in mass of distal parts of limbs of humans, which is known to decrease metabolic costs in endurance running, but has little effect on walking. Additionally, the mass of the upper body limbs in \"Homo\" has decreased considerably, relative to total body mass, which is important to reduce the effort of stabilizing the arms in running.\n\nJoint surface: Humans have evolved to absorb great shock and force on the skeletal structure while running. The impact force on the body can reach up to 3-4 times body weight in endurance running, putting the skeletal structure under great stress. To reduce this stress humans have increased joint surfaces relative to body mass to spread force over larger surface areas, particularly in the lower body. This adaptation, which allows humans to absorb great shock and force applied to the skeleton, is not seen in australopithecine skeletal structures.\n\nPlantar arch: The plantar arch in the human foot has an elastic spring function that generates energy for running but not walking. Fossils of the australopithecine foot show only partial arch, suggesting less of a spring capacity. For the plantar arch spring mechanism to function fully, there must also be restricted rotation in the hind and front parts of the foot. This restriction comes from projected toe bone and compacted mid-foot joint structures in humans, which does not become present until \"Homo habilis\".\n\nCalcaneal tuber and Achilles tendon: Studies have explored the calcaneal tuber, the posterior half of the calcaneus bone, as a correlate for Achilles tendon length and have found correlation between calcaneal tuber length and Achilles tendon length. Because shorter calcaneal tuber length leads to greater Achilles stretch, more kinetic energy is converted to elastic energy, translating into better overall running economy. Comparisons between Neanderthals and modern humans reveal that this adaptation was absent in Neanderthals, leading researchers to conclude that endurance running capabilities may have been enhanced in anatomically modern humans.\nShorter toes: Human toes are straight and extremely short in relation to body size compared to other animals. In running, the toes support 50 to 75% of body mass in humans. Impulse and mechanical work increase in humans as toe length increases, showing that it is energetically favorable to have shorter toes. The costs of shorter toes are decreased gripping capabilities and power output. However, the efficiency benefits seem to outweigh these costs, as the toes of \"A. afarensis\" remains were shorter than great apes, but 40% longer than modern humans, meaning that there is a trend toward shorter toes as the primate species moves away from tree-dwelling. This 40% increase in toe length would theoretically induce a flexor impulse 2.5 times that of modern humans, which would require twice as much mechanical work to stabilize.\n\nSemicircular canal: The semicircular canal, a series of three interconnected tubes within each ear, is important for sensing angular rotations of the head and thus plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and sensing and coordinating movement. Comparative studies have shown that animals with larger semicircular canals are able to sense a greater range of head movements and therefore have greater speed and agility. Evolutionarily, greatly reduced semicircular canal diameters are evident in Neanderthals but expanded in modern humans, suggesting that this adaptation was selected for in response to increased endurance running.\n\nVestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs): VORs are enabled by muscles in the eye, which sense angular accelerations of the head and adjust eye movements to stabilize these images. This was an important adaptation for running because it allowed \"Homo\" to see more clearly during the rough pitching motion that occurs during running.\n\nGluteals: The gluteus maximus in \"Homo erectus\" is significantly larger than that of \"Australopithecus\". It is suited to stabilize the trunk while running, but gluteals of that size and strength are not necessary for walking.\n\nIliac spine: \"Homo\" has expanded areas on the sacrum and posterior iliac spine for greater muscle attachment. These areas are used to stabilize the trunk and reduce the body's forward pitch caused by running strides.\n\nIn addition to advances in skeletal structure and stabilization, adaptations that led to increased efficiency in dissipation of heat were instrumental in the evolution of endurance running in \"Homo\". The duration for which an animal can run is determined by its capacity to release more heat than is produced to avoid lethal temperatures.\n\nThe majority of mammals, including humans, rely on evaporative cooling to maintain body temperature. Most medium-to-large mammals rely on panting, while humans rely on sweating, to dissipate heat. Advantages to panting include cooler skin surface, little salt loss, and heat loss by forced convection instead of reliance on wind or other means of convection. On the other hand, sweating is advantageous in that evaporation occurs over a much larger surface area (the skin), and it is independent of respiration, thus is a much more flexible mode of cooling during intense activity such as running. Because human sweat glands are under a higher level of neuronal control than those of other species, they allow for the excretion of more sweat per unit surface area than any other species. Heat dissipation of later hominins was also enhanced by the reduction in body hair. By ridding themselves of an insulating fur coat, running humans are better able to dissipate the heat generated by exercise.\n\nIn addition to improved thermoregulation, hominins have evolved an enhanced method of respiration consistent with the demands of running. Due to their orientation, respiration in quadrupedal mammals is affected by skeletal and muscular stresses generated through the motion of running. The bones and muscles of the chest cavity are not only responsible for shock absorption, but are also subjected to continuous compression and expansion during the running cycle. Because of this movement, quadrupeds are restricted to one breath per locomotor cycle, and thus must coordinate their running gait and respiration rate. This tight coordination then translates into another restriction: a specific running speed that is most energetically favorable. The upright orientation of bipedal hominins, however, frees them from this respiration-gait restriction. Because their chest cavities are not directly compressed or involved in the motion of running, hominins are able to vary their breathing patterns with gait. This flexibility in respiration rate and running gait contributes to hominins having a broader range of energetically favorable running speeds.\n\nDuring periods of prolonged exercise, animals are dependent on a combination of two sources of fuel: glycogen stored in the muscles and liver, and fat. Because glycogen is more easily oxidized than fat, it is depleted first. However, over longer periods of time, energy demands require that fat stores be utilized as fuel. This is true for all mammals, but hominins, and later modern humans, have an advantage of being able to alter their diet to meet these prolonged energy demands.\n\nIn addition to flexibility in the utilization of energy, hominins have evolved larger thyroid and adrenal glands which enable them to utilize the energy in carbohydrates and fatty acids more readily and efficiently. These organs are responsible for releasing hormones including epinephrine, norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), glucagon, and thyroxine. Larger glands allows for greater production of these key hormones and ultimately, maximized utilization of stored fuel.\n\nTaken together, the flexibility in diet and the enhanced usage of fuel heightens the previously mentioned finding that, unlike quadrupeds, hominins do not have a single energetically optimal running speed. For quadrupeds, increasing running speed means increasing the demand for oxygen and fuel. Due to skeletal structure and bipedalism, hominins are free to run energetically over a broader range of speeds and gaits, while maintaining a constant energy consumption rate of approximately 4.1 MJ per 15 km. Thus their utilization of energy is greatly enhanced.\n\nAll of the aforementioned adaptations enabled Homo to scavenge for food more effectively. Endurance running could have been used as a means of gaining access to distant carcasses or food stores faster than other scavengers and/or carnivores. Scavenging may have taken one or both of two forms: Opportunistic scavenging and strategic scavenging.\n\nEarly Homo almost certainly scavenged opportunistically. Scavenging is considered opportunistic when one \"come[s] across carcasses in the course of [their] daily foraging activities\".\n\nStrategic scavenging involves a planned search for carcasses. This style of scavenging would have benefitted from endurance running much more than opportunistic scavenging. Strategic scavenging would have involved the use of long range cues, such as birds circling overhead. Endurance running would have been advantageous in this setting because it allowed hominins to reach the carcass more quickly. Selection pressures would have been very high for strategic scavenging, because hominins were diurnal, while their major competitors (hyenas, lions, etc.) were not. Thus, they would have had to make sure to capitalize on daytime carcasses. Selection pressure also came from the weakness of Homo. Because they were very weak, they were unlikely to drive off any large competition at the carcass. This fact led to an even higher need for a way to reach the carcass before these competitors.\n\nPersistence hunting is \"a form of pursuit hunting in which [the hunter uses] endurance running during the midday heat to drive [prey] into hyperthermia and exhaustion so they can easily be killed\". Many question persistence hunting's plausibility when bow and arrow and other technologies were so much more efficient. However, in the Early Stone Age (ESA), spears were only sharpened wood, and hominins had not begun using tools. The lack of spearheads or bows meant they could only hunt from very close range—between 6 and 10 meters. Hominins thus must have developed a way to stab prey from close range without causing serious bodily harm to themselves. Persistence hunting makes killing an animal easier by first bringing it to exhaustion, so that it can no longer retaliate violently.\n\nPersistence hunters work by hunting in the middle of the day, when it is hottest. Hunters choose a single target prey and chase it at a speed between its trot and gallop, which is extremely inefficient for the animal. The hunter then continues pursuing over a period of hours, during which he may lose sight of the animal. In this case, the hunter must use tracks and an understanding of the animal to continue the chase. The prey eventually overheats and becomes unable to continue fleeing. Homo, which does not overheat as quickly because of its superior thermoregulation capabilities, is then able to stab the prey while it is incapacitated and cannot attack.\n\nDue to the complexity of following a fleeing animal, tracking methods must have been a prerequisite for the use of endurance running in persistence hunting. Scientists posit that early tracking methods were developed in open, sparsely vegetated terrain such as the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa. This \"systemic tracking\" involves simply following the footprints of animals and was most likely used for tracking grassland species on soft terrain. Skeletal remains suggest that during the Middle Stone Age, hominins used systemic tracking to scavenge for medium-sized animals in vegetation cover, but for hunting antelope in more open grasslands. From the Middle Stone Age into the Later Stone Age, tracking methods developed into what is termed \"speculative tracking\". When tracks could not easily be found and followed, \"Homo\" predicted where tracks were most likely to be found and interpreted other signs to locate prey. This advanced method of tracking allowed for the exploitation of prey in a variety of terrains, making endurance running for persistence hunting more plausible.\n\nAlthough exact dates and methods of persistence hunting are difficult to study, several recent accounts of persistence hunting have been recorded. Tribes in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana have been known to employ endurance running to scavenge and hunt prey. In the open country, the !Xo and /Gwi tribes run down slow-moving animals such as aardvark and porcupines, while during the hotter part of the day, they target animals such as eland, kudu, gemsbok, hartebeest, duiker, steenbok, cheetah, caracal, and African wildcats. In addition to these existing African tribes, it has been suggested that the Tarahumara people in Mexico and the Paiute people and Navajo in the American Southwest, used persistence hunting to capture prey including deer and pronghorn. The Aborigines in Australia are known to have hunted kangaroo in similar ways. Due to the increased availability of weapons, nutrition, tracking devices, and motor vehicles, one may argue that persistence hunting is no longer an effective method of hunting animals for food. However, there are examples of the practice occurring in modern times: the !Xo and /Gwi in the central Kalahari, still practice persistence hunting and have developed advanced methods of doing so. Similarly, the Russian Lykov family that lived in isolation for 40 years also used persistence hunting due to a lack of weapons.\n\nIn particular, these two tribes maximize the efficiency of persistence hunting by targeting specific species during different seasons. In the rainy season, prime targets include steenbok, duiker, and gemsbok, as wet sand opens their hooves and stiffens their joints. Hunting in the early rainy season is particularly advantageous because dry leaves form \"rocks\" in the animals' stomachs, resulting in diarrhea. Stiff joints and suboptimal digestion make the prey weaker and more available targets. In contrast, in the dry season, hunters run down kudu, eland, and red hartebeest because these species tire more easily in the loose sand. Hunters say that the best time to practice persistence hunting is near the end of the dry season when animals are poorly nourished and therefore more easily run to exhaustion. By targeting the most vulnerable prey during each season, the hunters maximize the advantages of endurance running.\n\n\nIn the oral traditions of the Hadza, an isolated aboriginal people of hunter-gatherers living in Tanzania, the \"Tlaatlanebe\" in their folk history's second epoch practiced this.\n\nIn the first epoch, the world was inhabited by large hairy humanoids called \"Akakaanebe\" (\"ancestors\"), who did not yet possess tools or fire. They simply \"stared\" at game until it fell dead, referring to either scavenging or early persistence hunting without weapons, or a combination of the two. They did not build houses but slept under trees.\n\nThe Tlaatlanebe of the second epoch, however, were large but without hair and lived in caves. As animals had grown more wary of humans due to earlier hunting, they now had to be chased and hunted with dogs.\n\nWhile there is evidence supporting selection on human morphology to improve endurance running ability, there is some dispute over whether the ecological benefits of scavenging and persistence hunting foraging behaviors were the driving force behind this development.\n\nThe majority of the arguments opposing persistence hunting and scavenging behaviors are linked to the fact that the paleohabitat and paleoecology of early \"Homo\" were not conducive to these behaviors. It is thought that the earliest members of \"Homo\" lived in African savanna-woodlands. This environment consisted of open grassland, as well as parts with dense vegetation—an intermediate between forest and open savannas. The presence of such tree covering would reduce visibility and so require tracking skills. This causes problems for the hypothesis of persistence hunting and running to aid scavenging.\n\nUngulates are known from archaeological evidence to have been the main prey of the early \"Homo\", and given their great speed, they would have easily been able to outrun early hominins. Ungulate speed, coupled with the variable visibility of the savanna-woodland, meant that hunting by endurance running required the ability to track prey. Pickering and Bunn argue that tracking is part of a sophisticated cognitive skill set that early hominins would not have had, and that even if they were following a trail of blood left by an injured ungulate—which may have been in their cognitive capacity—the ability to craft penetrating projectile technology was absent in early hominins.\n\nIt has been suggested that modern hunters in Africa do not use persistence hunting as a foraging method, and most often give up a chase where the trail they were following ends in vegetation. The rare groups of hunters who do occasionally participate in persistence hunting are able to do so because of the extremely hot and open environments. In these groups, a full day of rest and recovery is required after a hunt, indicating the great toll persistence hunts take on the body, making them rare undertakings.\n\nFinally, in critique of Liebenberg's research on modern day persistence hunting, it was revealed that the majority of the hunts initiated were prompted for filming rather than spontaneous, and that few of these hunts were successful. The hunts that were successful involved external factors such as the hunters being able to stop and refill water bottles.\n\nA response to these criticisms has been formulated by Lieberman et al., noting that it is unclear how humans could have grown to occupy a new niche as a diurnal social carnivore without persistence hunting, as the weapons preferred in modern hunter-gatherer tribes would not have been available at the time.\n\nThe proposed benefit of endurance running in scavenging is the ability of early hominins to outcompete other scavengers in reaching food sources. However paleoanthropological studies suggest that the savanna-woodland habitat caused a very low competition environment. Due to low visibility, carcasses were not easily located by mammalian carnivores, resulting in less competition.\n\n"}

Rao wrote the play \"Kanyasulkam\" in 1892, which is often considered the greatest play in the Telugu language. One of the pioneers of Indian theatre, Rao holds the titles \"Kavisekhara\" and \"Abyudaya Kavitha Pithamahudu\". In 1910, Rao has scripted the widely known Telugu patriotic song \"Desamunu Preminchumanna\".\n\nIn 1897, Kanyasulkam was published (by Vavilla Ramaswamy Sastrulu and Sons, Madras) and was dedicated to Maharaja Ananda Gajapati. Gurajada Appa Rao (along with brother Syamala Rao) had written several English poems. His Sarangadhara, published in \"Indian Leisure Hour\" was well received. The editor of the Calcutta-based \"Rees and Ryot\" Sambhu Chandra Mukherji read it and re-published it in his magazine. \"Gundukurti Venkata Ramanayya\", editor of the \"Indian Leisure Hour\" encouraged Gurazada greatly during the same period. In 1891, Gurajada was appointed to the post of Epigraphist to the Maharaja of Vizianagaram.\n\nGurazada was born on 21 September 1862 at his maternal uncle's home in Rayavaram village, near Yelamanchili, Visakhapatnam district. in a Brahmin family. His parents were Venkata Rama Dasu and Kausalyamma. Gurajada lived most of his life in and around Vizianagaram in what was then called as Kalinga Rajyam. He and his father before him were both employed by the princely state of Vizianagaram. Gurazada enjoyed a close relationship with the ruling family during his adult life.\nGurazada had his initial schooling in Cheepurupalli while his father was working there. His remaining schooling was done at Vizianagaram after his father died. During that time, he was taken care of by the then M.R. College Principal, C. Chandrasekhara Sastri who provided him free lodging and boarding. He completed his matriculation in 1882 and obtained F.A. in 1884. Soon after, he was employed as a teacher in M.R. High School in 1884 with a salary of Rs.25.\n\nIn 1887, Gurajada spoke at a Congress Party meeting in Vizianagaram. His daughter Voleti Lakshmi Narasamma was born in 1887. He was simultaneously involved in social work and became a member of the Voluntary Service Corps in Visakhapatnam in 1888. He was elected vice-president of the Ananda Gajapati Debating club in 1889. His son Gurazada Venkata Ramadasu was born in 1890. In 1891 he was promoted to Lecturer (Level III) with a salary of Rs.125. He taught the F.A. and B.A. classes several subjects including English Grammar, Sanskrit Literature, Translation, Greek and Roman Histories. His younger brother Syamala Rao died in 1892 while studying at Madras Law College.\n\nIn 1911, he was appointed to the Board of Studies by Madras University. The same year, Gurajada and his friends started the \"Andhra Sahitya Parishat\" to promote use of spoken dialects. The next year, he was invited to attend the meeting of the Bangeeya Sahitya Parishat (Bengal Literary Association) at Calcutta.\n\nGuraZada took retirement in 1913, the then Madras University honored him with the title \"Emeritus Fellow\". Gurazada Apparao died on 30 November 1915.\n\n\"Kanyasulkam\" is about the deplorable condition of widows in traditional Brahmin families in the Andhra region of India during the 19th century. The play is a highly thought-provoking social drama dealing with social issues relevant to the time. Gurajada Apparao was deeply troubled by the double standards, hypocrisy and social inequalities in the Indian society. The English preface to the first edition of his play states: \"Such a scandalous state of things is a disgrace to society, and literature can not have a higher function than to show up such practices and give currency to a high standard of moral ideas.\n\nUntil reading habits prevail among masses, one must look only to the stage to exert such healthy influence.\" Perhaps for the first time in Telugu literary history, a prostitute was given a very positive image so much so that she is shown to better the lives of many people during the course of the play. The play is ageless in the sense that its projection of the Indian mindset and psyche is very relevant and applicable in Indian Society today. The play was in some ways way ahead of its time and was very bold in criticizing the popular opinions and practices during that era. It frequently jabs at the male-dominated society of India, by bringing to the forefront certain egoistic idiosyncrasies of a typical Indian male, in an unflattering manner. It also questions the practices of witchcraft, sorcery, and their popular usage in medical practice during that period in India.\n\nHe was married to Appala Narasamma in 1885. In the mean time, he continued his studies and graduated with B.A. (Philosophy major and Sanskrit minor) in 1886. For some period during 1886, he worked as Head Clerk in the Deputy Collector's office. On Vijayadasami day, 1887, he joined as a Lecturer (Level IV) in \"M.R. College\" with a salary of Rs.100. Around the same time, he was introduced to Maharajah Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju (1850–1897).\n\nIn 1905, Gurajada's mother died. In 1906, his close friend P.T. Srinivasa Iyyangar, principal of Mrs. A.V.N. College, Visakhapatnam started an association to promote curriculum reform in high schools. One of the chief aims was to introduce spoken dialects. Along with him, J.A. Yates (1874–1951) -a British civil servant, Gidugu and Gurajada were the principal members. Another friend S. Srinivasa Iyengar (1874–1941) also gave a lot of support and encouragement. Incidentally, this Srinivasa Iyengar was a well-known lawyer and was the President of AICC (All India Congress Committee) annual session at Guwahati in 1926. Gurajada's childhood friend and classmate in Chipurupalli, Gidugu Rammurty (1863–1940) was his school of thought.\n\n"}

His maternal grandfather, Hugh Derfel Hughes, was a noted local historian who wrote a well-regarded book on the history of the area. He went to Friars School, Bangor, in 1894 but had only been there for just over a year when he suffered a serious accident. This left him with back injuries that made him bedridden for several years.\n\nHaving recovered, he attended Clynnog School in 1901 and in 1902 won a scholarship to the Bangor University. In 1905 he graduated with honours in Greek, then in 1906 in Welsh. He spent the 1906–07 academic year at the Department of Welsh working for his M.A. degree and assisting Sir John Morris-Jones, the Professor of Welsh, before being appointed an assistant lecturer. In 1920 a Chair of Welsh Literature was specially created for him, which he held until Sir John Morris-Jones died in 1929, when he became Professor of Welsh Language and Literature.\n\nIfor Williams had a lifelong interest in Welsh place-names, and was one of the first to apply rigorous academic methods to this field. He published \"Enwau Lleoedd\" (\"Place Names\") in 1945 which is still of great value today. Many of his early publications were written in order to provide teaching material and included versions with detailed notes of a number of old Welsh tales, notably the \"Mabinogi\" in 1930. He also produced books giving the text with notes of the works of a number of mediaeval poets such as Dafydd ap Gwilym and others in 1914 and Iolo Goch in 1925 with colleagues.\n\nHis main field of study however was Old Welsh and the earliest Welsh Poetry. He produced \"Canu Llywarch Hen\" in 1935 covering the poetry associated with Llywarch Hen, then in 1938 possibly his most important work, \"Canu Aneirin\", the text with notes of the Gododdin attributed to the 6th-century poet Aneirin. For the first time the original text was distinguished from later additions and made comprehensible with notes, and this work has provided the foundation for all subsequent work on this poetry. He wrote an introduction to \"Canu Taliesin\" in 1960 on work of the poet Taliesin, with particular emphasis on the dating of the 6th century poems in the Taliesin corpus. The book followed his introduction with a new translation by J.E. Caerwyn Williams. Ifor Williams also published works on later Welsh poetry, such as the 10th century Armes Prydain.\n\nWilliams edited the \"Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies\" from 1937 to 1948. He was also a speaker on the radio, and selections of his radio lectures were published in three books. He retired in 1947 and was knighted the same year. In 1949 the University of Wales awarded him the honorary degree of Ll.D.. He lived between 1913–1947 in Menai Bridge and retired to Pontllyfni where he died in 1965. He is buried in the burial ground attached to Capel Brynaerau, Pontllyfni.\n\n"}

{"id": "2853353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2853353", "title": "Legislation on Chinese Indonesians", "text": "Legislation on Chinese Indonesians\n\nIndonesian law affecting Chinese-Indonesians were conducted through a series of laws, directives, or constitutions enacted by the Government of Indonesia that affected the lives of Chinese Indonesians or Chinese nationals living in Indonesia since the nation's independence. The laws were made against Chinese Indonesians. Most of these laws are revoked following Reformation era under president Abdurrahman Wahid.\n\nIn the early 1950s the Government of Indonesia implemented the Benteng program (\"fortress program\"), under which only Native Indonesians (\"pribumi\") were allowed to have licenses to import certain items. This rule gave rise to the term \"Ali Baba\", referring to illicit co-operation between Chinese businessmen and native Indonesians who had connections in the government bureaucracy.\n\nPresidential Regulation 10 of 1959 () was a law directive issued by Indonesian government and signed by Minister of Trade, Rachmat Mujomisero. The law prohibited foreign nationals from doing retail business in rural areas and required them to transfer their businesses to Indonesian nationals by 1 January 1960 or relocate to urban areas. This directive was approved by President Sukarno. The rule became controversial since its implementation resulting in several people being killed in West Java (also known as racial riot of Cibadak) and triggered a huge exodus of Chinese Indonesians back to China. Although the regulation merely mentioned that only \"foreign citizens\" were required to do the relocation and closure of business, the law affected many Chinese nationals and Chinese Indonesians. From the 86,690 foreign business retailer listed, about 90 percent of these were Chinese.\n\nRight after the Indonesian Independence in 1945, the Indonesian people was overwhelmed by the euphoria of \"freedom\" and took over a lot of foreign companies: this action was referred to as \"Anti-Dutch sentiment\". Among others, one was a Dutch company Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (KPM), a company serving in sea transportation from Netherlands to Indonesia. Marhaen, a labour group that later on become a political party, took over this company. Other foreign capital seized were oil fields, by the oil labourers claiming themselves as \"Laskar Minyak\" (The Oil Defenders).\n\nAfter a while, the Government of Indonesia realised that unskilled and inexperienced Indonesians were unable to run the company. The Indonesians, referred to as \"Kaum pribumi\", also did not have enough capital, and it was almost impossible to compete with foreign investment and the Chinese capital (before independence, the ethnic Chinese had more chances to do business from colonialist ruler). These companies suffer losses after the seizure. As a solution, the Government of Indonesia signed an agreement during Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in Den Haag, Netherlands, which stated that the government of Indonesia would return all seized foreign investment assets to its previous owner. In return, to strengthen up the weak Indonesians (pribumi), the Government of Indonesia had the right to issue a law or directive to protect the national interest and those who were \"economically feeble\".\n\nOn 19 March 1956, during Indonesian National Importer Congress in Surabaya (\"Kongres Importir Nasional Indonesia\"), Asaat Datuk Mudo made an opening oration that the Chinese had become monopolistic in doing their business by closing all possible entry routes for Indonesian nationals to join the trade market.\nAs a closing statement, Assat also added that he believes this was the time to have a special economy initiative to protect Indonesian (pribumi).\n\nAsaat's speech became the beginning of \"Asaat movement\" or \"Pro Indonesian (term used was for Indonesian was \"Pribumi\") movement\" and had a huge impact on the following rules favouring it. In November 1959, PP Nomor 10 Tahun 1959 was issued.\n\nIn the 1950s, almost all retail stores in Indonesia were owned by Chinese or Chinese-Indonesians from grocery stores, hardware stores and even restaurants. Alwi Sahab, a Betawi culture expert stated that during his youth in Kwitang, Central Jakarta, the economic centre was in Jakarta fully dependent on the Chinese or Chinese Indonesian businessman. \n\nTempo magazine investigation published in year 2009 mentioned that during the implementation, the law affected 86,690 foreign retailers listed (90 percent Chinese) to about 500,000 were affected. However, Waspada Daily in their commemorative anniversary published their story printed in the 1960s during the happening, and it had a different number, according to Waspada Daily only about 25,000 small groceries booths by foreign retailers (mainly) Chinese affected by PP No. 10.\n\nThe sanctions specified in the directive were only property confiscation (all items had to be given to Koperasi), fines, and forced relocation, but, in practice, there were also some offenders executed (Cimahi and Cibadak, West Java).\n\nIn some places, the law was enforced by the military. The military shot dead two Chinese women, which triggered a riot in Cimahi, Jawa Barat. It was also noted that the Chinese were forced to leave their home and properties. However, while, nationwide, the implementation of this law went smoothly, in some places like Bandung and Medan, there were Chinese merchants trying to stop the implementation of PP 10 by hiding or emptying the stores and piling the goods in warehouses, causing price increases of main food materials. Specially, after another government directive was issued about price adjustments, according to the Attorney General Special Instruction, in some areas, including North Sumatra, Economic Survaillance Teams were formed to watch certain issues in economy such as stabilising prices and making appropriate actions to everyone who withhold the food program implemented by the government. The Economic Surveillance Team in North Sumatra manage to secure 200 warehouses in Medan consisting of food materials, the merchants being punished by imprisonment.\n\nThe law was meant to strengthen the national economy in Indonesia, yet this law resulted in a tense diplomatic relation between Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China (PRC). During a meeting between State Minister Subandrio and Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia (Huang Chen) in Jakarta, the PRC insisted that PP No. 10 should be reviewed, and the request was denied. Later on during a parliamentary hearing, State Minister Subandrio restated that there is no element of anti-Chinese related in the implementation of PP No. 10, the law being solely the beginning of nationalisation and socialisation in the Indonesian economy, and as part of the Indonesian revolution movement. On the nationalisation part, PP No. 10 stated that foreign retailers must be closed outside \"ibukota kabupaten\" and the merchant had to live only in his property, which was not allowed to conduct any business activities. Foreigners had to close their business at the latest on 1 January 1960 and give all their assets to Koperasi.\n\nThe Government of PRC was upset. On 10 December 1959, Peking radio announced a campaign for Chinese citizen to return to \"The Warmth of Motherland\". The PRC Embassy in Jakarta soon listed all Chinese citizens interested in returning to China. About 199,000 applied, but only 102,000 managed to be placed in a ship sent by the PRC government. The tension between PRC Government and Government of Indonesia reduced after PRC Prime Minister Zhou Enlai met President Soekarno.\n\nAccording to Mestika Zed from Andalas University, Padang, West Sumatera, Asaat Datuk Mudo was a real nationalist and always reacted according to facts and reality. The economy of \"pribumi\" (Native Indonesian) after independence was weak with no one defending them. Meanwhile, even during Dutch Imperialism, the Chinese always had a better economy than the \"pribumi\". After Indonesian independence, they took over the economy from small, middle, and large scale. Assaat's ideas were later adopted by Tunku Abdul Rahman and Mahathir Mohamad as the Malaysian economy policy to protect the majority and indigenous ethnic Malay in Malaysia, which was then faced with a similar economic situation.\n\nFrom historical perspective, even in the beginning of Indonesian Independence the Chinese was always been suspected because they are divided into three groups: \"Pro-Dutch\", \"Pro-Chinese Government\", and \"Pro-Indonesian Nationalist Movement\". There are also Indonesian Chinese who agree that it was needed to do an assimilation or \"pribumisation\" of Indonesian Chinese (also known as the Tionghoa) through religion (Islam and PITI) as Moslem organisation. Hamka for example, is included in this group. They have given their support and chances to Chinese-Indonesians to prove that they want to become a \"good Indonesian citizen\". There is also a lot of co-operation between the Chinese and the Indonesians noted during Indonesian national movement. Even some of the prominent Chinese figures were trying hard to make the Chinese-Indonesian return to Indonesia. Yap Thiam Hien, a Chinese-Indonesian lawyer, famous for his Indonesian nationalist idealism, established Baperki (Indonesian Citizenship Discussion Body) in 1954. The organisation's purpose was to make Chinese-Indonesians willing to be an Indonesian citizen, specially to those that take side to the Dutch and the Chinese Government. This body also gave a lot of contribution in proposing the Indonesian Citizenship Law 1958, which was implemented on the beginning of 1960. The discriminative rule also noted as an attempt to maintain politics of divide and conquer.\n\nLeo Suryadinata, a Chinese-Indonesian now teaching in National University of Singapore (NUS), thinks that both \"fortress rules\" or PP 10/ 1959 is a beginning anti-Chinese movement in Indonesia. According to Suryadinata, during colonialism by the Dutch, the Chinese-Indonesians were mostly small retailers, but after Indonesian independence, their position was strengthened, which is why \"pribumi\" think that they cannot compete and would like to take over the power by using the government.\n\nCabinet Presidium Decision 127 of 1966 (\"\", 127/U/Kep/12/1966) was an Indonesian law passed in 1966 that suggested Indonesian-sounding names to be adopted by Indonesian Chinese. It was considered to be part of the anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia. The resident Chinese community in Indonesia resented it because it forced them to lose traditional family names. However, some people thwarted the government efforts to some degree by incorporating their Chinese name into their new Indonesian name. For example, the Chinese family name \"Tan\" was easily embedded in the Indonesian name \"Sutanto\".\n\nPresidential Decision 240 of 1967 (\"\", Keppres No. 240/1867) mandated assimilation of \"foreigners\" and supported a previous directive, 127/U/Kep/12/1966, for Indonesian Chinese to adopt Indonesian-sounding names.\n\nPresidential Instruction No. 14/1967 (Inpres No. 14/1967) on Chinese Religion, Beliefs, and Traditions effectively banned any Chinese literature and cultures in Indonesia, including the prohibition of Chinese characters. Although Chinese names were not explicitly mentioned, \"newly naturalized\" Indonesian Chinese were strongly advised to adopt non-Chinese names. (Annulled by former president Abdurrahman Wahid in Keppres No. 6/2000; annulment supported by former president Megawati Soekarnoputri in Keppres No 19/2002 by declaring Chinese New Year as national holiday.)\n\nLaws affecting Chinese Indonesians proliferated under the New Order regime under former President Suharto's reign. Suharto was a strong advocate for Chinese assimilation rather than integration. As part of 1967's 'Basic Policy for the Solution of the Chinese Problem' and other measures, only one Chinese-language newspaper was allowed to continue, all Chinese religious expressions had to be confined to their homes, Chinese-language schools were phased out, Chinese script in public places was banned, and Chinese were encouraged to take on Indonesian-sounding names. Most of this legislation were revoked following Suharto's fall from power in 1998. \n\nAmpera Cabinet Presidium Circular 6 of 1967 () was released on 28 June 1967. One of the points of contention is the selection of a proper term to describe Indonesian residents of Chinese descent. Accompanying explanatory text to Article 26 of the 1945 Constitution used the term \"Tionghoa\" to describe this group. In 1948, the Communist Party of Indonesia began using \"Tionghoa\" in its terminology, prompting the beginning of an unofficial ban on its use. By 1967, a cabinet circular enforced the use of the term \"Cina\" over \"Tionghoa\" and \"Tiongkok\".\n\n\nThere are exceptions to laws and regulations that ban the use of Mandarin. The use of Mandarin in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, for example, is not prohibited, since legal proceedings related to this case have been suspended after lobbying made to the Attorney General (Jaksa Agung) of Indonesia by INI (Ikatan Naturopatis Indonesia).\n\nDuring his tenure as President, Abdurrahman Wahid ended restrictions on Chinese culture and language, and made Chinese New Year as a national holiday. Today, Indonesian Chinese hold the same rights as other ethnic groups. They can practise their culture daily, with the use of the Chinese language being also now allowed. Metro TV became the first to air its news in Chinese.\n\nChinese schools are now able to be established as either International or \"National- plus\" schools. Mandarin Chinese is also taught as an optional extracurricular subject in many schools.\n\n\n"}

It has its roots in glossolalia ('speaking in tongues').\n\nSpeakers consider Medefaidrin to be a 'spirit language'. It was created by two leaders of the church, Michael Ukpong and Akpan Akpan Udofia. They report that the Holy Spirit revealed the words of the language to Ukpong, while Udofia wrote them down. At the time Ibibio was not a written language, and Udofia created a script to write Medefaidrin.\n\nAfter finalizing the language in 1936, members of the church started a school in which children were instructed in Medefaidrin. This was not tolerated by the British colonial government, who closed the school that same year. Nonetheless, the language continued to be used for church activities, including liturgy and hymns, and for letters and written contracts between members. The language faded from use, but in 1986 Udofia began teaching it again in the church's Sunday school in Ididep. Old manuscripts in the script are in poor condition, and in the 21st century there has been some effort to preserve them.\n\nIn structure, the language is largely a relexification of English, though the semantics are closer to the native language of its users, Ibibio. Medefaidrin is a stress-accented rather than tonal language, though this may be changing under Ibibio influence. There are several consonant clusters that do not exist in English. (Ibibio has no consonant clusters.) The definite article is \"dei\", and several prepositions alliterate or rhyme with their English equivalents: \"su\" \"to\", \"fra\" \"from\", \"nai\" \"by\", \"kin\" \"in\". Most words, however, resemble nothing in English or Ibibio, but appear to have been created without a specific underlying system. The morphology is not highly developed, but a few elements have been taken from English, such as the plural in -s (z?). The vigesimal numbering system, however, and the calendar, reflect Ibibio norms. The calendar year contains sixteen four-week months.\n\nThe script has upper- and lower-case letters like the English alphabet, but the letters were invented and there is no systematic relationship between glyph and sound. There are a number of arbitrary digraphs, whose pronunciation cannot be determined from their component letters, again as in English.\n\nMedefaidrin script was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2018 with the release of version 11.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Medefaidrin is U+16E40–U+16E9F and contains 91 characters: \n\n\n"}

The whale, distressed by the harpoon, attempts to flee and thus drags the whalers' longboat along with it. The speed of the \"sleigh ride\" would vary depending on the species of the whale, with certain species (e.g. humpbacks) giving faster rides. The sperm whale was the whale that caused the longest drag events, reaching speeds of 23 mph (37 km/h). The length of the drag for the sailors would last as long as the whale could swim before it became exhausted. Fin whales and sei whales were the most dangerous species, as they would dive scores of fathoms deep taking the longboat and its occupants beneath the surface if possible. Once the whale had exhausted its energy, the sailors (if still alive) would kill it and harvest its oil.\n\nThe discovery of petroleum and natural gas in Pennsylvania in the mid-1800s began a slow end to the whale hunting by American whalers. Other nations followed as either they discovered petroleum reserves of their own, or the increase in the trade of natural gas and oil rendered whale hunting less worthy of the dangers inherent in its pursuit. Japan still engages in the practice; Norway closed its last rendering station at Grytviken (South Georgia Island) about 1965. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "207444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207444", "title": "Page 3", "text": "Page 3\n\nPage 3 was a feature in the British tabloid newspaper \"The Sun\" for over 44 years, from November 1970 until January 2015. It consisted of a large photograph of a topless female glamour model, often known as a \"Page 3 girl,\" usually published on the third page of the print edition.\n\nWhen \"The Sun\" became a tabloid on 17 November 1969, it began intermittently publishing images of clothed glamour models on its third page. The editors introduced nudity on 17 November 1970 when they printed an image of 20-year-old model Stephanie Khan in her \"birthday suit\" to celebrate the newspaper's first anniversary as a tabloid. Topless Page 3 girls soon became a regular feature in \"The Sun\" and are credited with helping to boost the newspaper's circulation significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. Some Page 3 girls became household names. Samantha Fox, who appeared on Page 3 from 1983 to 1986, became one of the most photographed British women of the 1980s, and famously earned more than then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher while still in her teens. Britain's other \"red top\" tabloids introduced competing features under different names. \"The Daily Star\" called its topless models \"Starbirds.\" \"The Daily Mirror\" also experimented with topless models, although it scrapped the feature in the 1980s. \n\nPage 3 generated considerable controversy throughout its run. Critics often argued that Page 3 objectified and demeaned women. Others believed that images of topless glamour models were inappropriate for a generally circulated national newspaper. Campaigners regularly advocated for legislation to ban Page 3 or tried to convince newspaper owners and editors to voluntarily eliminate the feature or modify it so that models no longer appeared topless. Campaigns against Page 3 proved fruitless for many years, with \"The Sun\" often branding opponents of the feature, such as Labour MP Clare Short, as killjoys. However, pressure increasingly mounted on the publication to end the feature after activists launched a No More Page 3 campaign in 2012.\n\nThe Irish edition of \"The Sun\" ceased publishing topless Page 3 models in August 2013, citing cultural differences between Ireland and the UK. The decision was subsequently taken to drop Page 3 from the UK edition as well. On 19 January 2015, another News UK title, \"The Times\", reported that it \"understands that Friday's edition of [\"The Sun\"] was the last that will carry an image of a glamour model with bare breasts on that page.\" However, after several days of publishing images of clothed glamour models, \"The Sun\" on 22 January 2015 stated on its front page that \"We've had a mammary lapse\" and featured a topless photograph of 22-year-old Nicole Neal on Page 3. This seeming intent to restore topless models caused a media and social media backlash, after which no further Page 3 images appeared in the print edition. \"The Sun\" continued the feature online via its Page3.com website until March 2017, at which point it ceased to update the website with new content. As of September 2018, the Page3.com website has been removed. \"The Daily Star\" has continued to print topless models on Page 3. \n\nWhen Rupert Murdoch relaunched the flagging \"Sun\" newspaper in tabloid format on 17 November 1969, he began publishing photographs of clothed glamour models on its third page in a move intended to help the paper compete with its principal rival, the \"Daily Mirror\", which was printing photos of women in lingerie or bikinis. The first edition featured that month's Penthouse Pet, Ulla Lindstrom, wearing a suggestively unbuttoned shirt. Page 3 photographs over the following year were often provocative, but did not feature nudity.\n\nWhether it was editor Larry Lamb or Murdoch who decided to introduce the Page 3 feature is disputed, but on 17 November 1970, the tabloid celebrated its first anniversary by publishing a photograph of 20-year-old Singapore born model Stephanie Khan in her \"birthday suit\" (i.e., in the nude). A sub-editor misread her name as Stephanie Rahn, a German surname. Sitting in a field, backlit by the sun, with one of her breasts visible from the side, Khan was photographed by Beverley Goodway, who became \"The Sun\"s principal Page 3 photographer until he retired in 2003. Lamb thought the models featured should be \"nice girls\"; he believed that \"big-breasted girls look like tarts\". Page 3 was intended to be \"breezy, not sleazy\"; Chris Horrie wrote in 1995 that it was intended as comparable to the naturism of \"Health and Efficiency\" magazine rather than top-shelf pornography titles.\n\nPage 3 was not a strictly daily feature at the beginning of the 1970s. \"The Sun\" only gradually began to feature Page 3 models in more overtly topless poses, with their nipples clearly visible. The feature, and the paper's other sexual content, quickly led to \"The Sun\" being banned from some public libraries. The first such decision was taken by a Conservative council in Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, although it was reversed after a series of local stunts organised by the newspaper and a change in the council's political orientation in 1971.\n\nThe feature is partly credited with the increased circulation that established \"The Sun\" as one of the most popular newspapers in the United Kingdom by the mid-1970s. In an effort to compete with \"The Sun\", the \"Daily Mirror\" and \"Daily Star\" tabloids also began publishing images of topless women, although the \"Daily Mirror\" stopped featuring topless models in the 1980s, deeming the photographs demeaning to women.\n\n\"The Sun\" made some stylistic changes to Page 3 in the mid-1990s. It became standard to print Page 3 photographs in colour rather than in black and white. Captions to Page 3 photographs, which previously contained sexually suggestive double entendre, were replaced by a simple listing of models' first names, ages, and hometowns. After polling its readers, \"The Sun\" in 1997 instituted a policy of featuring only models with natural breasts.\n\nIn June 1999, \"The Sun\" launched its official Page 3 website, \"Page3.com\", which featured the tabloid's daily Page 3 girl in three different poses, including the photograph published in the printed edition. On 1 August 2013, coinciding with the launch of the subscription-based website \"Sun+\", the official Page 3 website became accessible only to \"Sun+\" subscribers.\n\nBefore 2003, British tabloids sometimes featured 16- and 17-year-old girls as topless models. Samantha Fox, Maria Whittaker, Debee Ashby, and others began their topless modelling careers in \"The Sun\" when they were 16. The \"Daily Sport\" was even known to count down the days until it would feature a girl topless on her 16th birthday, as it did with Linsey Dawn McKenzie in 1994. After 2003, the legal age for topless modelling was raised to 18.\n\nDuring her tenure as deputy editor of \"The Sun\", Rebekah Brooks argued that Page 3 lowered the newspaper's circulation because women readers found the feature offensive. When she became the tabloid's first female editor in January 2003, she was widely expected either to terminate the feature or to modify it so that models no longer exposed their breasts. However, Brooks changed her position and became a staunch advocate of the feature. She later wrote an editorial defending Page 3 from its critics, calling its models \"intelligent, vibrant young women who appear in \"The Sun\" out of choice and because they enjoy the job.\" \"Guardian\" journalist Hadley Freeman in 2005 accused Brooks of having \"played up\" Page 3 by introducing the \"News in Briefs\" caption (a paragraph attributing the newspaper's editorial views to the Page 3 model). The caption was removed in June 2013 when David Dinsmore took over as editor.\n\nCritics usually considered Page 3 to be demeaning and objectifying to women, a form of softcore pornography that was inappropriate for publication in a national newspaper readily available to children. Some campaigners sought legislation to have Page 3 banned. Others, wary of calling for government censorship of the press, sought to convince newspaper editors and owners to voluntarily remove the feature or modify it so that it no longer featured a topless female model.\n\nA YouGov survey carried out in October 2012 found marked differences in attitude toward Page 3 among readers of different newspapers. 61% of \"Sun\" readers wished to retain the feature, while 24% said that the newspaper should stop showing Page 3 women. However, only 4% of \"Guardian\" readers said \"The Sun\" should keep Page 3, while 86% said it should be abolished. The poll also found notable differences by gender, with 48% of men overall saying that Page 3 should be retained, but just 17% of women taking that position.\n\nPolitical campaigners for legislative action against Page 3 included Labour Party MPs Clare Short and Harriet Harman, Liberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone, and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. \"The Sun\" has responded to such campaigns with mockery. When Short tried in 1986 to introduce a House of Commons bill banning topless models from British newspapers, \"The Sun\" branded her \"killjoy Clare\". When Short renewed her campaign against Page 3 in 2004, \"The Sun\" superimposed her face on a Page 3 model's body and accused her of being \"fat and jealous\". \"The Sun\" also branded Harman a \"feminist fanatic\" and Featherstone a \"battleaxe\" because of their stances against Page 3.\n\nIn August 2012, Lucy-Anne Holmes, a writer and actress from Brighton, began a grassroots social media campaign called No More Page 3 with the goal of convincing \"The Sun\" editors to voluntarily remove Page 3 from the newspaper. Holmes stated that she began the campaign after noticing that despite the achievements of Britain's women athletes in the 2012 Summer Olympics, the largest photograph of a woman in the nation's biggest-selling newspaper was \"a massive image of a beautiful young woman in her knickers\". Holmes further argued that Page 3 perpetuated the outdated sexist norms of the 1970s, portrayed women as sex objects, negatively affected girls' and women's body image, and contributed to a culture of sexual violence against women and girls. Some commentators, such as Kira Cochrane in \"The Guardian\", were supportive of Holmes' goals although commentators in publications such as the \"Telegraph\" and \"New Statesman\" criticised the campaign, calling it \"censorious\" and \"sinister\".\n\nAt the Liberal Democrats party conference in September 2012, former MP Evan Harris with the support of others, lent support to Holmes' campaign by proposing a party motion to \"[tackle] the projection of women as sex objects to children and adolescents by restricting sexualised images in newspapers and general circulation magazines to the same rules that apply to pre-watershed broadcast media\". However, party leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg distanced himself from the motion. In an October 2012 radio interview, Clegg said he did not support a legislative ban on Page 3, believing that government in a liberal society should not dictate the content of newspapers. \"If you don't like it, don't buy it ... you don't want to have a moral policeman or woman in Whitehall telling people what they can and cannot see,\" Clegg stated.\n\nThe Leveson Inquiry heard arguments for and against Page 3. Representatives of women's groups (including Object and the End Violence Against Women Coalition) argued that Page 3 was part of an endemic culture of tabloid sexism that routinely objectified and sexualised women. The inquiry also heard testimony from \"Sun\" editor Dominic Mohan, who argued that Page 3 was an \"innocuous British institution\" that had become a \"part of British society\". The Leveson report concluded that arguments over Page 3, and the representation of women in the tabloid press more generally, raised \"important and sensitive issues which merit further consideration by any new regulator\".\n\nIn February 2013, Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News International, parent group of the \"Sun,\" stated on social networking site Twitter that he was considering replacing Page 3 with a \"halfway house\", whereby Page 3 would feature clothed glamour photographs, but not bare breasts.\n\nIn June 2013, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas defied parliamentary dress code to wear a T-shirt bearing the slogan \"No More Page Three\" during a House of Commons debate on media sexism. Arguing that \"The Sun\" newspaper should be removed from sale in Parliament until it dropped the feature, she said that \"if Page Three still hasn't been removed from \"The Sun\" by the end of this year, I think we should be asking the government to step in and legislate\". Culture minister Ed Vaizey responded by stating that the government did not plan to regulate the content of the press. Later that month, newly appointed \"Sun\" editor David Dinsmore confirmed that he would continue printing photographs of topless women on Page 3, calling it \"a good way of selling newspapers\".\n\nIn August 2013, citing \"cultural differences\" between the UK and Ireland, Paul Clarkson, editor of \"The Sun\"s Irish Republic edition, announced that he would no longer print images of topless models on Page 3. The Irish \"Sun\" now features images of glamour models with their breasts covered. The No More Page 3 campaign called the decision \"a huge step in the right direction\", and thanked Clarkson \"for taking the lead in the dismantling of a sexist institution\", and called on Dinsmore to follow suit with the newspaper's UK edition.\n\nThe hopes of campaigners were further raised when Rupert Murdoch, in his Twitter feed in September 2014 suggested the Page 3 feature was \"old fashioned\". Eighteen months earlier on Twitter Murdoch had suggested that it might be better to show \"glamorous fashionistas\" (i.e., clothed models). Murdoch affirmed that the feature would eventually end in an interview for \"India Today\" magazine in 1994. While defending it from criticism, he said: \"But show it to me in any other newspaper I own. Never in America, never in Australia. Never. Never. Never. It just would not be accepted.\"\n\nThe feature in the British newspaper was reported as having been scrapped in 2015 with the edition of 16 January supposedly the last to carry the feature, after a 20 January article in \"The Times\", another Murdoch paper, said that a decision had been made to end Page 3 in the present incarnation.\n\nOn 22 January 2015, after an absence of six days, \"The Sun\" returned to publishing shots of topless female models. A notice appeared in the issue: \"Further to recent reports in all other media outlets, we would like to clarify that this is Page 3 and this is a picture of Nicole, 22, from Bournemouth. We would like to apologise on behalf of the print and broadcast journalists who have spent the last two days talking and writing about us.\" In the evening of 21 January, Dylan Sharpe, the head of public relations at \"The Sun\" wrote on social media: \"I said that it was speculation and not to trust reports by people unconnected to the Sun. A lot of people are about to look very silly\".\n\nThe apparent ending of the feature gained much attention in the British press. Clare Short thought that the dropping of topless photographs on Page 3 of \"The Sun\" \"is an important public victory for dignity.\" As Caroline Lucas explained in an article for \"The Independent\": \"So long as \"The Sun\" reserves its right to print the odd topless shot, and reserve its infamous page for girls clad in bikinis, the conversation isn't over.\" The business minister Jo Swinson criticised the newspaper, saying that the decision to replace topless models with women in bikinis did not go far enough. After the re-appearance of a topless Page 3 model after nearly a week's absence, Lucy-Anne Holmes wrote on social media: \"So it seems the fight might be back on.\"\n\nThe edition of 22 January saw the return of a topless Page 3 model, but this revival has turned out to be a one-off. \"The Sun\" continued to run the Page 3 website, featuring multiple topless shots of a different model on a daily basis until 29 March 2017.

{"id": "187801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187801", "title": "Shopping cart", "text": "Shopping cart\n\nA shopping cart (American English) or trolley (British English), also known by a variety of other names, is a cart supplied by a shop, especially supermarkets, for use by customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the checkout counter during shopping. In many cases customers can then also use the cart to transport their purchased goods to their vehicles, but some carts are designed to prevent them from leaving the shop.\n\nIn many places in the United States and the United Kingdom, customers are allowed to leave the carts in designated areas within the parking lot, and store personnel will return the carts to the storage area. In many continental European premises, however, coin- (or token-) operated locking mechanisms are provided to encourage shoppers to return the carts to the correct location after use.\n\nStudies have shown that it is advisable for shoppers to sanitize the handles and basket areas prior to handling them or filling them with groceries due to high levels of bacteria that typically live on shopping carts. This is due to the carts having a high level of exposure to the skin flora of previous users.\n\nMost modern shopping carts are made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic and have been designed to nest within each other in a line to facilitate collecting and moving many at one time and also to save on storage space. The carts can come in many sizes, with larger ones able to carry a child. There are also specialized carts designed for two children, and electric mobility scooters with baskets designed for disabled customers.\n\nIn the United States, 24,000 children are injured each year in shopping carts. Some stores both in the USA and internationally have child carrying carts that look like a car or van with a seat where a child can sit equipped with a steering wheel and sometimes a horn. Such \"Car-Carts\" may offer protection and convenience by keeping the child restrained, lower to the ground, protected from falling items, and amused.\n\nShopping carts are usually fitted with four wheels, however if any one wheel jams the cart can become difficult to handle. Most carts in the United States have swivel wheels at the front, while the rear wheels are fixed in orientation, while in Europe it is more common to have four swivel wheels. This difference in design correlates with smaller retail premises in Europe.\n\nAn alternative to the shopping cart is a small hand-held shopping basket. A customer may prefer a basket for a small amount of merchandise. Small shops, where carts would be impractical, often supply only baskets, or may offer a small cart which uses an inserted shopping basket within the frame of the cart to provide either choice to a customer.\n\nOne of the first shopping carts was introduced on June 4, 1937, the invention of Sylvan Goldman, owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in Oklahoma. One night, in 1936, Goldman sat in his office wondering how customers might move more groceries. He found a wooden folding chair and put a basket on the seat and wheels on the legs. Goldman and one of his employees, a mechanic named Fred Young, began tinkering. Their first shopping cart was a metal frame that held two wire baskets. Since they were inspired by the folding chair, Goldman called his carts \"folding basket carriers\". Another mechanic, Arthur Kosted, developed a method to mass-produce the carts by inventing an assembly line capable of forming and welding the wire. The cart was awarded patent number 2,196,914 on April 9, 1940 (Filing date: March 14, 1938), titled, \"Folding Basket Carriage for Self-Service Stores\". They advertised the invention as part of a new “No Basket Carrying Plan.\" Goldman had already pioneered self-serve stores and carts were part of the self-serve retail concept.\n\nThe invention did not catch on immediately. Men found them effeminate; women found them suggestive of a baby carriage. \"I've pushed my last baby,\" an offended woman informed Goldman. After hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility, as well as greeters to explain their use, shopping carts became extremely popular and Goldman became a multimillionaire. In urban areas like New York City, where transporting groceries home from the store's parking lot is more likely to involve walking and/or a trip by public transportation than a car ride, privately owned carts resembling Goldman's design are still popular. Instead of baskets, these carts are built to hold the paper bags dispensed by the grocery store.\n\nAnother shopping cart innovator was Orla Watson, who invented the swinging rear door to allow for \"nesting\" in 1946.\n\nGoldman continued to make modifications to his original design, but advice from his trusted business partners Fred Taylor, a grocery store owner, and George O'Donnell, a grocery store refrigeration salesman, and the incorporation of Watson's swinging door yielded the familiar nesting cart that we see today (albeit the original telescope cart had two baskets rather than one). Goldman patented a similar version of the cart which he called the \"Nest-Kart\" in 1948, over one year after Watson filed for his patent. The Nest-Kart incorporated the same nesting mechanism present on the shopping carts designed by Watson, and an interference investigation was ordered by Telescope Carts, Inc. alleging infringement of the patent in 1948. After a protracted legal battle, Goldman ultimately recognized Watson’s invention and paid one dollar in damages for counterfeit, in exchange for which Watson granted Goldman an exclusive operating license (apart from the three licenses that had already been granted).\n\nIn 1909, Bessie DeCamp invented a seat belt for chairs, go-carts or carriages. This was well before shopping carts with child seating areas were invented. Goldman introduced a child seating area on shopping carts in 1947. For whatever reason, it wasn't until 1967 that seat belts for shopping carts were introduced by David Allen. It was high tech for the time, because it was a retractable seat belt.\n\nIn 1946, Orla Watson devised a system for a telescoping (i.e., \"nesting\") shopping cart which did not require assembly or disassembly of its parts before and after use like Goldman's cart; Goldman's design up until this point required that the cart be unfolded much like a folding chair. This cart could be fitted into another cart for compact storage via a swinging one-way rear door. The swinging rear door formed the basis of the patent claim, and was a major innovation in the evolution of the modern shopping cart. Watson applied for a patent on his shopping cart invention in 1946, but Goldman contested it and filed an application for a similar patent with the swinging door feature on a shopping cart with only one basket in 1948 which Goldman named the \"Nest-Kart\". After considerable litigation and allegations of patent infringement, Goldman relinquished his rights to the patent in 1949 to Watson and his company, Telescope Carts, Inc. realizing that the swinging rear door feature was the key to Watson's patent. Watson was awarded patent #2,479,530 on August 16, 1949. In exchange, Goldman was granted an exclusive licensing right in addition to the three other licenses previously granted; Telescope Carts, Inc. continued to receive royalties for each cart produced by Goldman's company that incorporated the \"nesting\" design. This included any shopping cart utilizing his hinged rear door, including the familiar single basket \"nesting\" designs similar to those used in the present.\n\nOwing to its overwhelming success, many different manufacturers desired to produce shopping carts with the rear swinging door feature but were denied due to the exclusive license issued to Goldman. The federal government filed a lawsuit against Telescope Carts, Inc. in 1950 alleging the exclusive license granted to Goldman was invalid, and a Consent Decree was entered into where Telescope Carts, Inc. agreed to offer the same license to any manufacturer. Orla Watson and Telescope Carts, Inc. licensed their telescoping shopping cart design to several manufacturers throughout the 1950s and 1960s until the patent expired.\n\nIn 2012, a driverless shopping cart was made by Chaotic Moon Labs. The device, called \"Project Sk8\" or \"Smarter Cart\" was basically a cart fitted with Windows Kinect (to detect obstacles), and an electric drivetrain, and used in conjunction with a Windows 8 tablet. For smaller stores, shopping baskets with wheels can be used either as a large basket or a small cart. These carts are designed for indoor use only\n\nPast studies determined that retailers who did not offer shopping carts such as Sears suffered lower sales in comparison with retailers who did use shopping carts.\nSubsequent to the introduction of shopping carts and centralized checkout lines at Sears stores, the company noticed a correlating increase in sales.\n\nIn 2004 British supermarket chain Tesco, trialed shopping carts with user-adjustable wheel resistance, heart rate monitoring and calorie counting hardware in an effort to raise awareness of health issues. The cart's introduction coincided with Tesco's sponsorship of the cancer awareness Race for Life.\n\nAlso in 2004, shopping carts were identified as a source of pathogens and became a major public health concern. This was primarily due to the media spotlight on a Japanese research study revealing large amounts of bacteria on shopping carts. Those findings were later backed by a University of Arizona study in 2007.\n\nIn 2009 researchers developed prototypes of computerized context aware shopping carts by attaching tablet computers to ordinary carts. Initial field trials showed that the prototype's context awareness provided an opportunity for enhancing and altering the shopping experience.\n\nSome retailers, such as Target, have begun using carts fully made of recycled plastic with the only metal part being the wheel axles, drawing away from the established metal cart design. Target's cart has won design awards for its improved casters, interchangeable plastic parts to simplify repairs, and handles that improve maneuverability. Other cart designs also incorporate additional features such as a cupholder for cold or hot drinks or a bouquet of flowers, along with other features such as a secure shelf for a tablet computer or mobile phone to allow the use of mobile coupons and circulars, or as seen in an all-plastic design created for the Wisconsin-based Festival Foods and also used by Whole Foods Market by Bemis Manufacturing Company, all of these features, along with extra rungs on the side rail designed to attach plastic bags or carry handles for beverages. Smaller half-sized carts for smaller shopping trips have also become common.\n\nIn many countries, the customer has to pay a small deposit by inserting a coin, token or card, which is returned if and when the customer returns the cart to a designated cart parking point. One motivation behind the deposit system is to reduce the expense of employees having to gather carts that are not returned, and to avoid damage done by runaway carts. Trolleys that are not returned may be returned voluntarily by a pedestrian, with the deposit coin acting as a reward.\n\nAlthough almost ubiquitous in continental Europe and the UK, the deposit system is less common in Canada and has not been widely adopted in the United States, with the exception of some chains like Aldi, which require a $0.25 deposit. Other stores such as Costco and ShopRite also use the coin deposit system, but it is not used at all of their locations.\n\nIn Australia, deposit systems are common in some local government areas as they have been made compulsory by local law. Usually, all ALDI stores, and most Coles and Woolworths stores will have a lock mechanism on their carts which requires a $1 or $2 coin to unlock.\n\nThe deposit varies, but usually coins of higher value, such as €1, £1, or $1 are used. While the deposit systems usually are designed to accommodate a certain size of domestic coin, foreign coins, former currencies (like German D-Marks), or even appropriately folded pieces of cardboard can be used to unlock the carts as well. Cart collectors are also usually provided with a special key which they can use to unlock the carts from the cart bay and get the key back.\n\nSome retailers sell \"tokens\" as an alternative to coins, often for charity. Merchandising companies also offer branded shopping tokens as a product.\n\nShopping cart theft can be a costly problem with stores that use them. The carts, which typically cost between $75 and $150 each with some models being $300–400, are removed by people for various purposes. To prevent costly theft, estimated at $800 million worldwide per annum, stores use various security systems as discussed below.\n\nMost retailers in North America utilize a cart retrieval service, which collects carts found off the store's premises and returns them to the store for a fee. The primary strength of this system is the ability of pedestrian customers to take purchases home and allow retailers to recapture abandoned carts in a timely manner at a fraction of the cost of a replacement cart. It also allows retailers to maintain their cart inventories without an expensive capital outlay. A drawback of this method is that it is reactive instead of proactively preventing the carts from leaving a parking lot.\n\nElectronic systems are sometimes used by retailers. Each shopping cart is fitted with an electronic locking wheel clamp, or 'boot'. US Patent No. 5598144A. A transmitter with a thin wire is placed around the perimeter of the parking lot, and the boot locks when the cart leaves the designated area. Store personnel must then deactivate the lock with a handheld remote to return the cart to stock. Often a line is painted in front of the broadcast range to warn customers that their cart will stop when rolled past the line. However, these systems are very expensive to install and although helpful are not foolproof. The wheels can be lifted over the electronic barrier and/or pushed hard enough that the locks break. There are also safety concerns if the person pushing the trolley is running, and also if the trolley doesn't lock and is taken onto a road, locking due to magnetic materials under the road. Some cities have required retailers to install locking wheel systems on their shopping carts. In some cases, electronic systems companies have encouraged passage of such laws to create a captive audience of potential customers.\n\nA low-tech form of theft prevention utilizes a physical impediment, such as vertical posts at the store entrance to keep carts from being taken into the parking lot. This method also impedes physically disabled customers, which may be illegal in many jurisdictions. For example, in the United States, it is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nAnother method is to mount a pole taller than the entrance, onto the shopping cart, so that the pole will block exit of the cart. However, this method requires that the store aisles be higher than the pole, including lights, piping, any overhead signage and fixtures. It also prevents customers from carting their purchases to their cars in the store's carts. Many customers learn to bring their own folding or otherwise collapsible cart with them, which they can usually hang on the store's cart while shopping.\n\nA further system is to use a cattle grid style system. All pedestrian exits have specially designed flooring tiles which, along with specially designed wheels on the cart, will immobilize the cart as they roll onto them. Like the magnetic systems, this can easily be overcome by lifting the cart over the tiles.\n\nSome retailers, including the Aldi chain of supermarkets, use a system where each cart has a lock mounted on the handle, connecting it to the cart in front of it when nested together, or to a chain mounted on a cart collection corral. The lock releases when a suitable coin or token is inserted, and the user gets their coin or token ejected back out of the lock when the cart is reattached to another trolley. This encourages shoppers to bring their carts back, solving both theft and the issue of carts being left around parking lots. The system is slightly flawed, however, in that carts can be attached to each other away from the corral and retrieve your tokens from all but the front-most cart.\n\nThe names of a shopping cart vary by region. The following names are region specific names for shopping carts. Many of these names may be used alone or in descriptive phrases such as grocery ____, shopping ____, or supermarket _____ :\n\nSpecial electronic shopping carts are provided by many retailers for the elderly or people with a disability. These are essentially electric wheelchairs with an attached basket. They allow customers to navigate around the store and collect items.\n\nManually powered carts are also available specifically designed for use by wheelchair users. A still to be implemented aid for people with disabilities is the addition of a guide wheel at the center of rotation of a cart with four caster wheels. In order to allow the nesting of carts to be unhindered this guide wheel is attached to the front of the cart with a piece of spring steel which bends under the cart's weight.\n\n\n"}

In 1785 the family moved to Karbala (present-day Iraq) where Zeynalabdin Shirvani was admitted to a religious school and studied mostly Islamic subjects as well as Persian, Arabic and Turkic languages (Azerbaijani Turkic, Anatolian Turkish and Turkmen). In 1796, he moved to Baghdad where he spent a year studying geography, literature, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, and mathematics. At the age of 17, he went on his first journey. By the end of his life he will have travelled over 60,000 kilometres within 37 years.\n\nZeynalabdin Shirvani had keen interest in exploring Asia and almost never visited Europe. He was attached to his homeland and turned down many offers of local lords who were fascinated by his erudition and wanted him to settle on their lands (in Egypt, Turkey, etc.).\n\nDuring his first journey, Shirvani visited what is now Azerbaijan, Iraq, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.\n\nHis second journey included Iran, Oman, Yemen, Ethiopia, Sudan (he is considered the last Eurasian to visit the independent Kingdom of Darfur in 1820), Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Levant, and Turkey.\n\nFinally, on his third journey he travelled to Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Iraq.\n\nIn between those journeys, Shirvani also went on several small trips within Iran and Azerbaijan. He wrote reflections on all of his travels in three main works (all of them in Persian):\n\n\nAs well as his famous travel works, Shirvani also composed the Kashf ul-Maarif (\"The Discovery of Enlightenment\"), a rather philosophical piece of writing. It consists of Shirvani's biography in the preface, his meetings with famous scholars, and their beliefs and theories. The only copy of the book that is known to have survived to our era was discovered by Azerbaijani historian Agamir Guliyev in Kabul in 1973. The book was never published and the manuscript remained at Guliyev's private library.\n\nSome scholars believe that Shirvani wrote a biographical reflection on the great Sufi poet Rumi under the pen name Rahmat Ali Shah. The work was not published during Shirvani's lifetime but was later used in the introduction of an 1895 Bombay edition of the Masnavi.\n\nIt is important to note that Shirvani warned readers that inaccurate statements might have been included in his works as he was often persecuted by Islamic feudals who regarded his books as a \"threat to the religion\". In one case, a study on which he had been working for 25 years was stolen from him and burned by Muhammad Qasim of Gumsha. It took Shirvani a long time to partially restore the lost data.\n\nShirvani got married in Shiraz in the early 1820s. He had two sons one of whom died early and the other, Husamaddin Ali, followed his fathers footsteps and also became a geographer.\n\nIn 1838, Shirvani planned a pilgrimage to Mecca but died of an unknown disease on a ship near Jeddah (present-day Saudi Arabia), where he was buried.\n"}
