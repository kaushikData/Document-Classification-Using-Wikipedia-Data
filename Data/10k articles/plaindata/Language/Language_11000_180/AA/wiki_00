{"id": "5948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5948", "title": "Chinese input methods for computers", "text": "Chinese input methods for computers\n\nChinese input methods are methods that allow a computer user to input Chinese characters. Most, if not all, Chinese input methods fall into one of two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes. Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus resulting in slower typing speeds because they typically require users to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input; whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but have a difficult learning curve because they often require a thorough understanding of a character's strokes and composition.\n\nOther methods allow users to write characters directly onto touchscreens, such as those found on mobile phones and tablet computers.\n\nChinese input methods predate the computer. One of the early attempts was an electro-mechanical Chinese typewriter Ming kwai () which was invented by Lin Yutang, a prominent Chinese writer, in the 1940s. It assigned thirty base shapes or strokes to different keys and adopted a new way of categorizing Chinese characters. But the typewriter was not produced commercially and Lin soon found himself deeply in debt.\n\nBefore the 1980s, Chinese publishers hired teams of workers and selected a few thousand type pieces from an enormous Chinese character set. Chinese government agencies entered characters using a long, complicated list of Chinese telegraph codes, which assigned different numbers to each character. During the early computer era, Chinese characters were categorized by their radicals or Pinyin romanization, but results were less than satisfactory.\n\nChu Bong-Foo invented a common input method in 1976 with his Cangjie input method, which assigns different \"roots\" to each key on a standard computer keyboard. With this method, for example, the character 日 is assigned to the A key, and 月 is assigned to B. Typing them together will result in the character 明 (\"bright\").\n\nDespite its steeper learning curve, this method remains popular in Chinese communities that use traditional Chinese characters, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan; the method allows very precise input, thus allowing users to type more efficiently and quickly, provided they are familiar with the fairly complicated rules of the method. It was the first method that allowed users to enter more than a hundred Chinese characters per minute.\n\nAll methods have their strengths and weaknesses. The pinyin method can be learned rapidly but its maximum input rate is limited. The \"Wubi\" takes longer to learn, but expert typists can enter text much more rapidly with it than with phonetic methods.\n\nDue to these complexities, there is no \"standard\" method.\n\nIn mainland China, the wubi (shape-based) and pinyin methods such as Sogou Pinyin and Google Pinyin are the most popular; in Taiwan, Boshiamy, Cangjie, and zhuyin predominate; and in Hong Kong and Macau, the Cangjie is most often taught in schools.\n\nOther methods include handwriting recognition, OCR and voice recognition. The computer itself must first be \"trained\" before the first or second of these methods are used; that is, the new user enters the system in a special \"learning mode\" so that the system can learn to identify their handwriting or speech patterns. The latter two methods are used less frequently than keyboard-based input methods and suffer from relatively high error rates, especially when used without proper \"training\", though higher error rates are an acceptable trade-off to many users.\n\nThe user enters pronunciations that are converted into relevant Chinese characters. The user must select the desired character from homophones, which are common in Chinese. Modern systems, such as Sogou Pinyin and Google Pinyin, predict the desired characters based on context and user preferences. For example, if one enters the sounds \"jicheng\", the software will type 繼承 (to inherit), but if \"jichengche\" is entered, 計程車 (taxi) will appear.\n\nVarious Chinese dialects complicate the system. Phonetic methods are mainly based on standard pinyin, Zhuyin/Bopomofo, and Jyutping in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, respectively. Input methods based on other varieties of Chinese, like Hakka or Minnan, also exist.\n\nWhile the phonetic system is easy to learn, choosing appropriate Chinese characters slows typing speed. Most users report a typing speed of fifty characters per minute, though some reach over one hundred per minute. With some phonetic IMEs, in addition to predictive input based on previous conversions, it is possible for users to create custom dictionary entries for frequently used characters and phrases, potentially lowering the number of characters required to evoke it.\n\nShuangpin (双拼), literally dual spell, is a stenographical phonetic input method based on hanyu pinyin that reduces the number of keystrokes for one Chinese character to two by distributing every vowel and consonant composed of more than one letter to a specific key. In most Shuangpin layout schemes such as Xiaohe, Microsoft 2003 and Ziranma, the most frequently used vowels are placed on the middle layer, reducing the risk of Repetitive strain injury.\n\nShuangpin is supported by a large number of pinyin input software including QQ, Microsoft Bing Pinyin, Sogou Pinyin and Google Pinyin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Solutions to the task typically involve aspects of artificial intelligence and statistics, such as data mining and text mining. Because artifacts are typically a loosely structured sequence of words and other symbols (rather than concepts), the problem is nontrivial, but it can provide powerful insights into the meaning, provenance and similarity of documents.\n\nTraditionally, the conversion of words to concepts has been performed using a thesaurus, and for computational techniques the tendency is to do the same. The thesauri used are either specially created for the task, or a pre-existing language model, usually related to Princeton's WordNet.\n\nThe mappings of words to concepts are often ambiguous. Typically each word in a given language will relate to several possible concepts. Humans use context to disambiguate the various meanings of a given piece of text, where available machine translation systems cannot easily infer context.\n\nFor the purposes of concept mining however, these ambiguities tend to be less important than they are with machine translation, for in large documents the ambiguities tend to even out, much as is the case with text mining.\n\nThere are many techniques for disambiguation that may be used. Examples are linguistic analysis of the text and the use of word and concept association frequency information that may be inferred from large text corpora. Recently, techniques that base on semantic similarity between the possible concepts and the context have appeared and gained interest in the scientific community.\n\nOne of the spin-offs of calculating document statistics in the concept domain, rather than the word domain, is that concepts form natural tree structures based on hypernymy and meronymy. These structures can be used to produce simple tree membership statistics, that can be used to locate any document in a Euclidean concept space. If the size of a document is also considered as another dimension of this space then an extremely efficient indexing system can be created. This technique is currently in commercial use locating similar legal documents in a 2.5 million document corpus.\n\nStandard numeric clustering techniques may be used in \"concept space\" as described above to locate and index documents by the inferred topic. These are numerically far more efficient than their text mining cousins, and tend to behave more intuitively, in that they map better to the similarity measures a human would generate.\n\n"}

The premise states that a crocodile, who has stolen a child, promises the father/mother that their child will be returned if and only if they correctly predict what the crocodile will do next.\n\nThe transaction is logically smooth but unpredictable if the parent guesses that the child will be returned, but a dilemma arises for the crocodile if the parent guesses that the child will not be returned. In the case that the crocodile decides to keep the child, he violates his terms: the parent's prediction has been validated, and the child should be returned. However, in the case that the crocodile decides to give back the child, he still violates his terms, even if this decision is based on the previous result: the parent's prediction has been falsified, and the child should not be returned. The question of what the crocodile should do is therefore paradoxical, and there is no justifiable solution.\n\nThe crocodile dilemma serves to expose some of the logical problems presented by metaknowledge. In this regard, it is similar in construction to the unexpected hanging paradox, which Richard Montague (1960) used to demonstrate that the following assumptions about knowledge are inconsistent when tested in combination:\nAncient Greek sources were the first to discuss the crocodile dilemma.\n\n"}

Kinds of emic units are generally denoted by terms with the suffix \"-eme\", such as \"phoneme\", \"grapheme\", and \"morpheme\". The term \"emic unit\" is defined by Nöth (1995) to mean \"an invariant form obtained from the reduction of a class of variant forms to a limited number of abstract units\". The variant forms are called etic units (from \"phonetic\"). This means that a given emic unit is considered to be a single underlying object that may have a number of different observable \"surface\" representations. \n\nThe various etic units that represent a given emic unit of a certain kind are denoted by a corresponding term with the prefix \"allo-\", such as \"allophone\", \"allograph\", and \"allomorph\".\n\nThe first emic unit to be considered, in the late 19th century, was the phoneme. The word \"phoneme\" comes from the , \"phōnēma\", meaning \"that which is sounded\", from the verb φωνέω, \"phōneō\", \"sound\", which comes in turn from the noun φωνή, \"phōnē\", \"sound\". Thus it was originally used (in its French form \"phonème\") to refer simply to a speech sound. But it soon came to be used in its modern sense, to denote an abstract concept (for more details, see Phoneme: Background and related ideas). It is by analogy with \"phoneme\" that other emic units, such as the morpheme and the grapheme, were named using the \"-eme\" suffix. The actual terms \"emic unit\" and \"etic unit\" were introduced by Kenneth Pike (1954).\n\nThe prefix \"allo-\" used in terms such as \"allophone\" is from the Ancient Greek ἄλλος meaning \"other\". The prefix is also used in chemistry.\n\nThe following are the most commonly analyzed kinds of emic units in linguistics:\n\nOther examples of emic units in various branches of linguistics include the lexeme, grammeme, chereme, sememe, and tagmeme.\n\nIn linguistics a distinction is made between so-called \"emic\" and \"etic\" accounts. For example a phonemic description is one expressed in terms of phonemes, whereas a phonetic one is based on the phones actually produced. This distinction was generalized by Pike (1954) and is applied in various social and behavioral sciences. In this general sense, an emic account is one that assumes insider knowledge of a phenomenon (as for example the unconscious awareness of a language's phonemic system that is assumed to be possessed by that language's native speakers). By contrast, an etic account is one based on the observations of an outsider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is because verbs in Georgian do not tend to conform to a \"universal\" conjugation system like in most European languages.

The object (if present in context) is assumed to be 3rd person singular. N.B in this series, for some unknown reason, all screeves allow an optional \"-n-\" directly after the stem.\n\n\nThe verb paradigm follows. For simplicity, the verb form always assumes a 3rd person singular object:\n\nVerb root\n\n\"q'var\" - to love\n\nPresent subseries\n\nThe verb takes the 'subjective' versioniser \"i-\" in the 1st and 2nd persons, 'objective' \"u-\" in the 3rd person. Note the ending of the 2nd and 3rd person plural (subject) marker \"-t\" takes precedence over the 3rd person singular (object) marker \"-s\":\n\nFuture subseries\n\nHere the verb forms its screeves by using a pre-radical vowel \"e-\", and the thematic suffix \"-eb\", in a way similar to the class 2 verbs (but without the preverb):\n\nAorist series\n\nSince the verb does not have an aorist form, and uses the imperfect instead (as many other class 4 verbs), the aorist forms of \"shegiq'vardeba\" 'you'll fall in love with X' are substituted:\n\nPerfect series\n\nThis series is not especially consistent: the perfect screeve uses versionisers before the root, whereas the pluperfect and perfect subjunctive screeves take no versioniser. The series forms using the suffix \"-eb\", with \"-od\" as a further suffix in the pluperfect and perfect subjunctive screeves.\n\nN.B. It is important to bear in mind that each verb form given in the tables has a further five forms corresponding to the 1st and 2nd person singular direct objects, and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person plural direct objects, giving a theoretical total of 396 bi-personal forms! In practice however these forms are not always distinct (for example the plurality of the 3rd person is not always present in the form). For further discussion, see 'Direct and indirect objects'.\n\n\nPreverbs in Georgian can either add directionality to a verb, or can change the meaning of the verb entirely. It is also important to use the appropriate versioner in each case.\n\nSince preverbs are absent in the present series, it is important to consider the role of the verb in the context of the entire sentence as the verb by itself could convey any meaning in the present screeves.\n\n"}

According to the European Union for the Deaf, the majority of the 60,000–90,000 Deaf people in Italy use LIS.\n\nLike many sign languages, LIS is in some ways different from its \"spoken neighbour\"; thus, it has little in common with spoken Italian, but shares some features with non-Indo-European oral languages (e.g. it is verb final, like the Basque language; it has inclusive and exclusive pronominal forms like oceanic languages; interrogative particles are verb final (\"You go where?\").\n\nA sign variety of spoken Italian also exists, the so-called Signed Italian which combines LIS lexicon with the grammar of spoken Italian: this is not Italian Sign Language, however.\n\nSome features of LIS are typical of sign languages in general, e.g. agreement between nouns, adjectives and verbs is not based on gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) but it is based on place, that is the spatial position in which the sign is performed: nouns can be placed everywhere in the space but their position must be consistent with that of pronouns and verbs. The LIS translation of the sentence \"The child speaks to the mother\" appears as \"Child-here mother-there this-speak-that\", rather than involving forms like \"he, she\". The voice intonation is replaced by facial expressions which mark interrogative sentences, imperatives and relative clauses. Other features of Italian Sign Language which can be found also in oral languages are: classifiers; dual, trial, quattrial and even quinquial forms in addition to the general plural; verbs inflected for person.\n\n"}

It states that every \"d\"-dimensional centrally symmetric polytope has at least 3 nonempty faces (including the polytope itself as a face but not including the empty set).\n\nIn two dimensions, the simplest centrally symmetric convex polygons are the parallelograms, which have four vertices, four edges, and one polygon; . A cube is centrally symmetric, and has 8 vertices, 12 edges, 6 square sides, and 1 solid; . Another three-dimensional convex polyhedron, the regular octahedron, is also centrally symmetric, and has 6 vertices, 12 edges, 8 triangular sides, and 1 solid; .\n\nIn higher dimensions, the hypercube [0,1] has exactly 3 faces, each of which can be determined by specifying, for each of the \"d\" coordinate axes, whether the face projects onto that axis onto the point 0, the point 1, or the interval [0,1]. More generally, every Hanner polytope has exactly 3 faces. If Kalai's conjecture is true, these polytopes would be among the centrally symmetric polytopes with the fewest possible faces.\n\nIn the same work as the one in which the 3 conjecture appears, Kalai conjectured more strongly that the \"f\"-vector of every convex centrally symmetric polytope \"P\" dominates the \"f\"-vector of at least one Hanner polytope \"H\" of the same dimension. This means that, for every number \"i\" from 0 to the dimension of \"P\", the number of \"i\"-dimensional faces of \"P\" is greater than or equal to the number of \"i\"-dimensional faces of \"H\". If it were true, this would imply the truth of the 3 conjecture; however, the stronger conjecture was later disproven.\n\nThe conjecture is known to be true for \"d\" ≤ 4. It is also known to be true for simplicial polytopes: it follows in this case from a conjecture of that every centrally symmetric simplicial polytope has at least as many faces of each dimension as the cross polytope, proven by . Indeed, these two previous papers were cited by Kalai as part of the basis for making his conjecture. Another special class of polytopes that the conjecture has been proven for are the Hansen polytopes of split graphs, which had been used by to disprove the stronger conjectures of Kalai.\n\nThe 3 conjecture remains open for arbitrary polytopes in higher dimensions.\n"}
{"id": "4214462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4214462", "title": "Lamy", "text": "Lamy\n\nLamy is a producer of writing instruments in Europe. The company is German-owned. Josef Lamy, who was a sales representative for The Parker Pen Company in Germany, founded the business in 1930 by purchasing the Orthos pen manufacturer. Lamy was a pioneer in the use of moulded synthetic plastics to make their product. Lamy was run by Josef Lamy's son, Manfred Lamy, until his retirement in 2006. He was succeeded by Bernhard M. Rösner.\n\nIn 1984, newspapers reported that Lamy's export share increased to 33 percent of turnover. In 1986, Lamy, Montblanc, and Parker held among them 70–80 percent of the West German market. Export markets then consisted of the US, Japan, and Austria. Lamy hoped to expand that export share to 50 percent of turnover, which stood at approximately 40 million Deutschmark (DM) for 1985. Turnover for Lamy increased to 48 million DM for 1987, then employing 350 people, increasing to 54 million DM in 1988 and a corresponding increase in staff to nearly 400.\n\nIn 1989, turnover increased to approximately 62 million DM. Lamy had begun taking on employees as sleeping partners. Approximately one third of the then 400-person workforce became sleeping partners. In that year, Lamy established contacts with East Germany and planned to do business there as well as in West Germany. 1991 held an increase in staff and turnover again, this time to 85 million DM and five hundred staff. Lamy invested in their \"innovation workshop\" in Heidelberg, in 1996, along with approximate expected turnover being 113 million DM. 1999 showed Lamy reporting stable turnover of approximately 120 million DM, though domestic demand has fallen.\n\nEach Lamy product has a name that evokes an idea related to it; \"Scribble\", for example, is their mechanical pencil. The company refers to their products by prefixing \"Lamy\" in front of the descriptive name, such as \"Lamy Scribble\" (to avoid repetition, here only the descriptive name is used).\n\nMany Lamy fountain pen models share the same type of feed and nib. Most use Fe-Ni-Cr stainless steel alloy Z 50 nibs which can be interchanged by the user.\nThe feeds are made of ABS plastic and after injection molding are chemically etched with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The etching process causes micro surface scratches by removing styrene from the feed surface and ink channels. This roughening optimizes ink flow characteristics over the feed surface.\nThe 2000 fountain pen model uses nibs of another type which is incompatible with Lamy's other fountain pen models.\n\nLamy's abc beginner's fountain pen was designed by Bernt Speigel to be used by children while learning to write. The body is made from maple wood and includes a name sticker in the cap to assist in identifying each student's pen.\nThe pen features a non round grip section optimized to be held with a 'tripod pen grip'.\n\nThe Safari is a noted design by Wolfgang Fabian\nand Bernt Spiegel of the Entwicklungsgruppe Mannheim\nwhich remains in production from 1980. The Safari and the derived AL-star and Vista lines are all cartridge/converter filled and are intended for students/young writers. Like the \"abc\" they all feature a non-rounded grip section optimized to be held with a 'tripod pen grip'.\n\nLamy's flagship fountain pen is the 2000. Designed by Gerd Alfred Müller and released in 1966, it remains in production today. The 2000 was innovative in its day for its use of a special polycarbonate resin produced by Bayer, Makrolon, for the body of the pen. It is the only contemporary Lamy fountain pen that has a semi hooded nib and is a piston fill pen offering 1.35 ml ink capacity, so thus only takes bottled ink. In addition to normal production mechanical pencil, ballpoint and four-color ballpoint versions, a commemorative fountain pen version was produced for the new millennium called the \"Edition 2000\", which features an inverse design of the original: a stainless steel body with Makrolon ring and polished clip.\n\nThe pico is a pocket telescoping ballpoint pen designed by Franco Clivio. It comes in chrome, red, blue, and black finishes. Like some other Lamy pens, the pico features a small protrusion to stop the pen from rolling. Lamy also produces a leather carrying case uniquely for this pen. The pen has also won a red dot award for product design\n\nOther designs such as the Safari and Studio come in rollerball form too, though certain designs such as the Swift are uniquely rollerball pens. The distinguishing design feature of the Swift is the retractable clip. When the point is extended, the Swift's clip retracts to be flush with the body of the pen, which helps the pen sit in the hand more comfortably, and also serves as a preventative reminder not to reinsert the pen into one's pocket with the point extended, which may cause staining.\n\nLamy produces multisystem pens, which combine a ballpoint and another feature within the one pen, such as the Pickup, which integrates a ballpoint and a highlighter into one body. The highlighter is released from the body of the pen by depressing a button on the body of the pen, and can be reinserted into the body of the pen. The Pickup was also designed by Wolfgang Fabian, and has won the red dot award for product design.\n\nLamy produces mechanical pencils. Some of the other Lamy designs exist in mechanical pencil form, such as the 2000 and the Safari. The Scribble, also designed by Hannes Wettstein, is a large-bodied pencil with triangular shapings on the body to help the grip.\n\nLamy produces fountain pen ink in bottles and proprietary ink cartridges. Lamy provide the widest range of colours in what it designates as T 10 cartridges, with black, blue, blue-black, red, green, turquoise and violet. The T 10 cartridge has approximately 1.15 ml ink capacity\n\nFor using bottled fountain pen ink Lamy offers several proprietary piston operated converters.\nThe ABC, AL-star, Joy, Nexx, Nexx M, Safari and Vista fountain pens can be fitted with the proprietary Z 24 or Z 28 converter that has approximately 0.7 ml ink capacity. The converters for the school/young writing line of fountain pens feature two protrusions that form fit into two arresting recesses in the grip sections of these pens.\nThe Accent, Aion, CP 1, Dialog 3, Imporium, Linea, Logo, ST and Studio fountain pens can be fitted with the proprietary Z 27 converter for the premium line of fountain pens that has approximately 0.7 ml ink capacity.\n\nLamy also makes double-ended pens that allow one to edit what they have written in ink before. One end is a white nib with a fluid that makes ink 'disappear', the other end has a nib that writes in blue ink which is not affected by the ink eraser so that one can write on top of what was just erased. However, after this is done, one can not rub it out again.\n\nEarlier Lamy designs includes the Lady and the Persona; \"vintage\" designs are varied but have numerical suffixes instead of descriptive names. The Lady was a design intended to appeal to women; the Lady is manufactured out of painted, hardened, porcelain and does not feature a clip as it was thought that women do not normally make use of the clip—a small protrusion prevents the pen from rolling on a flat surface. The Lady was designed by Wolfgang Fabian and Sharon Jodjaja was responsible for the barrel designs.\n\n"}

Founded in 1995 by writer Sandra Cisneros and named after the town in Gabriel García Marquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", the workshop gathers writers from all genres who work on geographic, cultural, economic, gender, and spiritual borders. An essential aspect of the Macondo Workshop is a global sense of community; participants recognize their place as writers in our society and the world.\n\nMacondo began over twenty years ago when author Sandra Cisneros gathered a group of writers, artists, scholars and activists around her dining table in her King William home to meet informally for rigorous writing workshops. Under the direction of Cisneros, and during its brief time at the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center, membership grew significantly. As such, Macondo has very established traditions and expectations that include a rigorous application process aimed at professional writers of all genres, and the \"Compassionate Code of Conduct,\" a document drafted by a group of past Macondistas outlining the principles and ethics that govern our organization. Macondo has over two hundred lifetime members, many of whom have been with the association from the beginning and who continue to receive support from the Macondo community. Macondo has grown and solidified itself as a space of intense artistic and cultural creativity where writers, artists, thinkers, scholars, and critics can come together and inspire and challenge one another in order to incite change in our respective communities.\n\nCisneros has described Macondo's mission as supporting and uniting writers \"who view their work and talents as part of a larger task of community-building and non-violent social change.\" The anthropologist and writer Ruth Behar has described participants as \"Americans of the other America, moving between cultures, languages, classes, homelands, translating our experience for ourselves and others.\"\n\nNoted past faculty members have included Ai Ogawa, Dorothy Allison, Julia Alvarez, Andrei Codrescu, Joy Harjo, Tim Z.

The Makaton language programme has been used with individuals who have cognitive impairments, autism, Down syndrome, specific language impairment, multisensory impairment and acquired neurological disorders that have negatively affected the ability to communicate, including stroke patients.\n\nThe name \"Makaton\" is derived from the first letters of the names of three speech and language therapists who helped devise the programme in the 1970s: the researcher Margaret Walker, and Katharine Johnston and Tony Cornforth, colleagues from the Royal Association for Deaf people.\n\nMakaton is a registered trade mark of The Makaton Charity, which was established in 2007. The original trademark application for Makaton was filed in the UK on 28 August 1979, with registration approved as from that date under UK trade mark registration no. 1119745.\n\nIn 2004 the Oxford University Press included Makaton as a common usage word in the Oxford English Dictionary. The entry states \"Makaton, n. Brit. A proprietary name for: a language programme integrating speech, manual signs, and graphic symbols, developed to help people for whom communication is very difficult, esp. those with learning disabilities.\"\n\nThe Makaton Language Programme uses a multimodal approach to teach language and literacy skills, through a combination of speech, signs, and graphic symbols used concurrently, or, only with speech with signs, or, only with speech with graphic symbols as appropriate for the student's needs. It consists of a Core Vocabulary of roughly 450 concepts that are taught in a specific order (there are 8 different stages). For example, stage 1 involves teaching vocabulary for immediate needs, like 'eat' and 'drink'. Later stages contain more complex and abstract vocabulary such as time and emotions. Once basic communication has been established, the student can progress in their language use, using whatever modes are most appropriate. Also, although the programme is organised in stages, it can be modified and tailored to the individual's needs. In addition to the Core Vocabulary, there is a Makaton Resource Vocabulary of over 7,000 concepts which are illustrated with signs and graphic symbols.\n\nOriginal research was conducted by Margaret Walker in 1972/73, and resulted in the design of the Makaton Core Vocabulary based on functional need. This research was conducted with institutionalised deaf cognitively impaired adults resident at Botleys Park Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey (closed in 2008). The aim was to enable them to communicate using signs from Sign Language. Fourteen deaf and cognitively impaired adults participated in the pilot study, and all were able to learn to use manual signs; improved behaviour was also noted. Shortly after, the Core Vocabulary was revised to include both children and adults with severe communication difficulties (including individuals who could hear), and was used in many schools throughout the UK in order to stimulate communication and language. In the early stages of development, Makaton used only speech and manual signs (without symbols). By 1985, work had begun to include graphic symbols in the Makaton Language Programme and a version including graphic symbols was published in 1986. The Core Vocabulary was revised in 1986 to include additional cultural concepts. The Makaton Vocabulary Development Project (MVDP) was founded in 1976 by Margaret Walker, who worked in a voluntary capacity as director until her retirement in October 2008. The first Makaton training Workshop was held in 1976 and supporting resources and further training courses were, and continue, to be developed. In 1983 the MVDP became a Charitable Trust and in 2007 changed its status to become the Makaton Charity.\n\nThe Makaton Core Vocabulary is adapted for use in different countries; signs from each country's deaf community are used, along with culturally relevant Makaton symbols. For example, in the United Kingdom, Makaton uses signs from British Sign Language (BSL); the signs are mainly from the London and South East England regional dialect. Makaton is used extensively throughout the UK, but has also been adapted for use in over 40 countries, including Poland, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Portugal, Greece, Kuwait and Japan. Within the UK, a variant \"Say It and Sign It\" from the West Sussex sign support system has been adopted by multiple nurseries and private courses. On 16 November 2018, comedian Rob Delaney read a book on the BBC's children's channel CBeebies entirely in Makaton and English; he had used Makaton to communicate with his late son Henry, who was rendered unable to talk after a tracheotomy.\n\nThe Makaton Charity:\n\n\n"}

He is considered as one of founders of the modern Belarusian language.\n\nBahdanovič was born in Minsk in the family of Adam Bahdanovič, an important Belarusian ethnographer who through most of his career worked as a bank clerk. Maksim was born in a family apartment at Karakazov House located at Trinity Hill where beside the Bahdanovich's apartment was located the First Parish School. His father was of unlanded peasantry family, while his mother (née Myakota) was of old Belarusian noble family of Kurcz coat of arms that was not adopted in the Russian Empire. Grandfather on his mother side, Apanas Janovich Myakota, was a Russian veteran of the Crimean War who for his military service received a lifelong nobility. Both of Maksim parents graduated pedagogical schools. Later father of Maksim, Adam, was involved with members of the revolutionary anti-tsarist Narodnaya Volya organization.\n\nIn 1892 the family moved to Hrodna where Maksim's father received a job at local bank. Soon after the move the future poet's mother, Maria, died of tuberculosis in 1896.\n\nIn 1896 Adam Bahdanovič moved with his children to Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. At that time Maksim wrote his first poems in the Belarusian language. In 1902 Bahdanovič attended a gymnasium. During the Revolution of 1905 he was an active participant of the strikes organised by his commilitodes.\n\nIn 1907 Nasha Niva came out with Bahdanovič's first published work — the novel \"Muzyka\".\n\nIn June 1908 the poet's family moved to Yaroslavl'. After finishing school in 1911 Bahdanovič went to Belarus to meet important figures of the Belarusian Renaissance: Vaclau Lastouski, Ivan Luckievich and Anton Luckievich.\nIn the same year he began studying of law at a Yaroslavl' lyceum. During his studies Bahdanovič worked at a newspaper, wrote numerous works of literature and was actively published in both Belarus and Russia.\n\nIn the beginning of 1914 his only book of poems, \"Vianok\" (\"A Wreath\"), was published in Vilna (today Vilnius).\n\nIn the summer of 1916, after absolvation of the lyceum, Maksim Bahdanovič moved to Minsk and worked there at the local guberniya administration.\n\nIn February 1917 Bahdanovič went to Crimea to be treated for tuberculosis. The treatment was unsuccessful, and that year he died in Yalta.\n\nThe poet's papers were kept at his father's house, but the collection was heavily damaged during the Russian Civil War in 1918.\n\nIn 1991–1995 a full collection of Bahdanovich's poetry was published in Belarus.\n\nNowadays there are museums of the poet open in Minsk (Maksim Bahdanovič Literary Museum), Hrodna and Yaroslavl'. Several streets in major cities of Belarus and Russia are named after him.\n\nThe operas Zorka Venera (by Jury Siemianiaka and Ales' Bachyla), and Maksim (by Ihar Palivoda).\n\nBahdanovich created many examples of social, artistic and philosophical lyrics. He was the first poet to introduce several new lyrical forms to Belarusian literature.\n\nMaksim Bahdanovich was a translator of Paul Verlaine, Heinrich Heine, Alexander Pushkin, Ovid, Horace and other poets into Belarusian and of Janka Kupala, Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Franko into Russian.\n\n"}

{"id": "30956367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30956367", "title": "Multi-competence", "text": "Multi-competence\n\nMulti-competence is a concept in second language acquisition formulated by Vivian Cook that refers to the knowledge of more than one language in one person's mind. From the multicompetence perspective, the different languages a person speaks are seen as one connected system, rather than each language being a separate system. People who speak a second language are seen as unique multilingual individuals, rather than people who have merely attached another language to their repertoire.\n\nThe concept has been backed up by studies showing how the different languages a person learns affect each other. The phenomenon of language transfer, or the first language affecting the second, has long been known. More recent research has also shown that the second language also affects the first in various subtle ways. There is also evidence that people who learn other languages gain general cognitive benefits.\n\nUnder multi-competence, the second language speaker is seen as more than the sum of the languages he speaks. This is in contrast with the assumption in much of second language research that the ideal model of a language is the monolingual native speaker. Setting the native speaker as the golden standard implies that second language speakers are somehow deficient in each language that they speak, whereas multi-competence sees them as having gained from learning a second language.\n\nTo avoid implying deficiency on the part of second language speakers, Cook prefers the term \"L2 user\" to \"L2 learner\". An \"L2 user\" is anyone who knows a second language and uses it regularly, irrespective of their language level.\n\nCentral to Cook's argument is the way in which people's language knowledge changes when they learn a second language. He makes three main points:\n\nPeople learning a second language rarely reach the same level of competence as native speakers. In fact, by definition, they can never become a native speaker of another language. Very few L2 users are at a level where they can pass for a native speaker, but even their knowledge is not exactly the same as that of monolingual native speakers. Most L2 users are immediately identifiable by their foreign accent, and often by their syntax or choice of words. Cook argues that this is not a negative thing, and that L2 users should not be judged to the same standards as monolinguals. Rather, they should be held to the standard of successful L2 users.\n\nWhen people learn a second language, the way they speak their first language changes in subtle ways. These changes can be with any aspect of language, from pronunciation and syntax to gestures the learner makes and the things they tend to notice. For example, French speakers who spoke English as a second language pronounced the /t/ sound in French differently from monolingual French speakers. Also, advanced English users of French judged the grammaticality of English sentences differently from English monolinguals. In addition, when shown a fish tank, Chinese speakers of English tend to remember more fish and less plants than Chinese monolinguals. This evidence suggests that language systems inside a person's mind cannot be viewed as completely separate from one another.\n\nL2 users think more flexibly than monolinguals, are more aware of language in general, and have better attitudes towards other cultures. For example, English children who had Italian lessons for one hour a week had higher word awareness in English than children who had no language lessons.\n\nAt the time the term \"multi-competence\" was coined, SLA research often relied on comparing an L2 user to native speakers of the L2 using methods of error analysis. The \"errors\" are usually defined by deviations from language norms and/or grammar rules. L2 users can also be measured based on how well they imitate typical native speakers.\n\nSLA research has suggested a bidirectional influence exists between a bilingual's L1 and L2. The foundational linguistic skills acquired during L1 learning are also utilized during L2 learning, meaning pre-existing L1 knowledge influences incoming L2 knowledge. Going in the other direction, an L2 user's interlanguage can also influence their L1 knowledge, a process known as \"reverse transfer\". L2 knowledge can influence the L1 in early acquisition stages as well as in later learning. Reverse transfer can result in an L2 user making mistakes when communicating in their L1. In extreme cases reverse transfer can lead to the loss of L1 knowledge. However, these effects are not always negative; L2 users often experience improved L1 reading and writing skills, as well as increased creativity.\n\nA new theory posits that an L2-user has a single lexicon, enabling parallel access to words in both their L1 and L2. When an L2 user is asked to name (or pronounce) words from their L1, units in the presented words that are also found in the user's L2 can be distractors and therefore increase reaction time and/or error rate. If there were separate lexicons for each language, then an L2 user should not become distracted by L2 word units when accessing their L1 knowledge. L2 users often have different voice-onset time (VOT)s than the average speaker of either their L1 or L2. \n\nMulti-competence has two major implications for language teaching. The first is about the question of what the final goal should be for language learners. The multi-competence viewpoint sees the goal of learning as becoming a successful L2 user. Language teaching, therefore, should reflect this: the goals of language learning should be based on what successful L2 users can do, not what monolingual native speakers can do. Also, teaching materials should show positive examples of L2 use and L2 users.\n\nThe second implication is for the use of the first language in the classroom. If the first language can never truly be separated from the second language in the mind, it makes no sense to forbid the use of the first language in the language classroom. Cook argues that banning the use of the first language will not stop learners from using it to help with their language learning, it will only make its use invisible to the teacher. Instead, Cook suggests that teachers should think about how they can make use of both languages in suitable ways.\n\n\n"}

It was based on the Avestan alphabet, a phonetic alphabet originally used to write Avestan, the language of the Avesta, the primary sacred texts of Zoroastrianism.\n\nPazend's principal use was for writing the commentaries (\"Zend\") on and/or translations of the Avesta. The word \"Pazend\" ultimately derives from the Avestan words \"paiti zainti\", which can be translated as either \"for commentary purposes\" or \"according to understanding\" (phonetically).\n\nPazend had the following characteristics, both of which are to be contrasted with Pahlavi, which is one of the other systems used to write Middle Persian:\n\nIn combination with its religious purpose, these features constituted a \"sanctification\" of written Middle Persian. The use of the Avestan alphabet to write Middle Persian required the addition of one symbol to the Avestan alphabet: This character, to support Middle Persian's , phoneme had not previously been needed.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Sassanids, after which Zoroastrianism came to be gradually supplanted by Islam, Pazend lost its purpose and soon ceased to be used for original composition. In the late 11th or early 12th century, Indian Zoroastrians (the Parsis) began translating Avestan or Middle Persian texts into Sanskrit and Gujarati. Some Middle Persian texts were also \"transcribed\" into the Avestan alphabet. The latter process, being a form of interpretation, was known as 'pa-zand'. \"Pazand texts, transcribed phonetically, represent a late and often corrupt Middle Persian pronunciation, and so present their own problems.\" \"The corruptions during this process are sometimes considerable.\" Among the transcribed texts are the prefaces (\"dibacheh\") to prayers in Avestan. These prefatory prayers are invariably written in Pazend because of the need for \"accurate\" pronunciation. This practice has led to the misconception that \"Pazend\" is the name of a language.\n\nFollowing Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron's translation of some of the texts of the Avesta in the late 18th century, the term \"Zend-Avesta\" was mistakenly used to refer to the sacred texts themselves (as opposed to commentaries on them). This usage subsequently led to the equally mistaken use of \"Pazend\" for the Avestan script as such and \"Zend\" for the Avestan language.\n\n"}

It is present in Unicode as .\n\nThe pilcrow can be used as an indent for separate paragraphs or to designate a new paragraph in one long piece of copy, as Eric Gill did in his 1930s book \"An Essay on Typography\". The pilcrow was a type of rubrication used in the Middle Ages to mark a new train of thought, before the convention of visually discrete paragraphs was commonplace.\n\nThe pilcrow is usually drawn similar to a lowercase q reaching from descender to ascender height; the loop can be filled or unfilled. It may also be drawn with the bowl stretching further downwards, resembling a backwards D; this is more often seen in older printing.\n\nThe word \"pilcrow\" originates from the Greek word \"paragraphos\". This was rendered in Old French as \"paragraphe\" and later changed to \"pelagraphe\". The earliest reference of the modern \"pilcrow\" is in 1440 with the Middle English word \"pylcrafte\".\n\nThe first way to divide sentences into groups in Ancient Greek was the original \"paragraphos\", which was a horizontal line in the margin to the left of the main text. As the \"paragraphos\" became more popular, the horizontal line eventually changed into the Greek letter Gamma (Γ and γ) and later into \"litterae notabiliores\", which were enlarged letters at the beginning of a paragraph. This notation soon changed to the letter K, an abbreviation for the Latin word \"kaput\", which translates as \"head\", i.e. it marks the head of a new thesis. Eventually, to mark a new section, the Latin word \"capitulum\", which translates as \"little head\", was used, and the letter C came to mark a new section in 300 BC. In the 1100s, C had completely replaced K as the symbol for a new chapter. Rubricators eventually added one or two vertical bars to the C to stylize it (as ⸿); the symbol was filled in with dark ink and eventually looked like the modern pilcrow (¶).\n\nScribes would often leave space before paragraphs to allow rubricators to draw the pilcrow. With the introduction of the printing press, space before paragraphs was still left for rubricators to draw by hand; however, rubricators could not draw fast enough for printers and often would leave the beginnings of the paragraphs as blank. This is how the indent before paragraphs was created. Nevertheless, the pilcrow remains in use in modern time in the following ways:\n\nIn legal writing, it is used whenever one must cite a specific paragraph within pleadings, law review articles, statutes, or other legal documents and materials.\n\nIn academic writing, it is sometimes used as an in-text referencing tool to make reference to a specific paragraph from a document that does not contain page numbers, allowing the reader to find where that particular idea or statistic was sourced. The pilcrow sign followed by a number indicates the paragraph number from the top of the page. It is rarely used when citing books or journal articles.\n\nIn proofreading, it indicates that one paragraph should be split into two or more separate paragraphs. The proofreader inserts the pilcrow at the point where a new paragraph should begin.\n\nIn some high-church Anglican and Episcopal churches, it is used in the printed order of service to indicate that instructions follow; these indicate when the congregation should stand, sit, and kneel, who participates in various portions of the service, and similar information. King's College, Cambridge uses this convention in the service booklet for the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols. This is analogous to the writing of these instructions in red in some rubrication conventions.\n\nOnline, it is used in some blogs and wikis to denote permalinks ().\n\nThe pilcrow is used in desktop publishing software such as desktop word processors and page layout programs to mark the presence of a carriage return control character at the end of a paragraph. It is also used as the icon on a toolbar button that shows or hides the pilcrow and similar \"hidden characters\", including tabs, whitespace, and page breaks. In typing programs, it marks a return that one must type.\n\nThe pilcrow may indicate a footnote in a convention using a sequence of distinct typographic symbols in sequence to distinguish the footnotes on a given page; it is the sixth in a series of footnote symbols beginning with the asterisk.\n\nThe pilcrow symbol is available in the default hardware codepage 437 of IBM PCs (and all other 8-bit OEM codepages based on this) at code point 20 (0x14), sharing its position with the ASCII control code DC4 (to the effect that it isn't easily accessible in most software under this position).\n\nThe pilcrow character was in the 1984 Multinational Character Set extension of ASCII at 0xB6 (decimal 182), from where it was inherited by ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987) and by Unicode as U+00B6 ¶ .\nThe html entity is codice_1, introduced in HTML 3.2 (1997). In LaTeX, the pilcrow glyph is invoked by codice_2 or codice_3.\n\nApart from , Unicode also defines , , and .\n\n\nIn Chinese, the traditional paragraph sign (rendered as 〇) is a thin circle about the same size as a Chinese character. This same mark also serves as a “zero” character, as a stylistic variation of the Chinese character for “zero”. As a paragraph sign, this mark only appears in older books, commonly found in the Chinese Union Version of the Bible. Its current use is generally as a “zero” character. However, it can also be found in some editions of the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon.\n\nIn Thai, the character can mark the end of a chapter or document.\n\nIn Sanskrit and other Indian languages, text blocks used to be written in stanzas. Two bars || represented a pilcrow.\n\n"}

A reception report consists of several pieces of information which help the station verify that the report confirms coverage of their transmission, and usually include the following information:\n\n\nThe listener's location relative to the station is also useful; this indicates how well the station's transmitter is performing and in which direction(s) its antenna is beaming the signal. The station also evaluates a reception report in light of the listener's receiver and antenna. Upon receipt of a correct report, a broadcaster sometimes issues a letter or postcard (known as a QSL card) to the sender, thanking them and confirming that the details are correct. \"QSL\" is part of the amateur radio Q code, meaning \"I acknowledge receipt\". One aspect of DXing is collecting QSL cards and letters from stations heard (similar to a birdwatcher's \"life list\"). QSLing a radio station involves writing an accurate reception report, mailing it to the station and awaiting a reply. Since QSLing is a voluntary act on the station's part, several techniques are used to improve a listener's success rate.\n\nStation engineers and other personnel are primarily interested in whether or not their station is heard, and how well; therefore, a complete and accurate reception report (whether by postal or e-mail) is generally appreciated. To begin, report the frequency, date and time the station was heard. For medium-wave (AM) stations, the time should be that of the time zone in which the station is located. Thus, if a listener hears stations from the Eastern time zone of North America (such as Ontario and New York), EST or EDT should be given (depending on the time of year). Stations in the Central time zone (such as Chicago) use CST or CDT, which is one hour earlier than Eastern time. If a listener is uncertain of the time zone, they should clearly indicate their local time or even better use UTC\n\nIt is helpful to jot down programming as it is heard. Useful details include:\n\n\nThe purpose of providing this information is to prove to the station that you heard their program and not that of another station. The more detail a listener can provide, the better the chance of eliciting a QSL. Include information, also, about how well the signal was received. For medium-wave reports, an indication of signal strength and any interference (co- or adjacent-channel interference, with identity of interfering station if possible) is usually sufficient. International shortwave broadcasters are familiar with the SINPO code:\n\n\nEach letter receives a value between 5 and 1, where 5 is the best and 1 the worst. Many shortwave listeners (known as \"program listeners\") desire nothing more than music and news from a broadcaster; however, for DXers a QSL collection is tangible proof of what they have heard. Some listeners use pre-printed forms if they are unfamiliar with the language spoken by station personnel. While major international broadcasters have not required return postage for a QSL, the growing popularity of e-mailed reception reports and e-QSLs has largely eliminated the necessity for international reply coupons (IRCs), mint stamps from the verifying station's country or \"green stamps\" (US dollar bills).\n"}

Often the timbres of different woodwind instrument registers tend to be markedly different.\n\n\nHowever, on the clarinet the notes from (written) G4 or A4 to B4 sometimes are regarded as a separate \"throat register\", even though both they and the notes from F4 down are produced using the instrument's lowest normal mode; the timbre of the throat notes differs, and the throat register's fingerings also are distinctive, using special keys and not the standard tone holes used for other notes.\n\nThe register in which an instrument plays, or in which a part is written, affects the quality of sound or timbre.

It was originally spoken in Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. It is closely related to other Algonquian languages, such as Mesquakie-Sauk (Sac and Fox) and Kickapoo.\n\nShawnee is severely threatened, with speakers shifting to English. The approximately 200 remaining speakers are older adults. The decline in usage of Shawnee is largely the result of reform schools for Native American children that forced an education in English, causing some Native Americans to cease teaching their languages to children.\n\nOf the 2,000 members of the Absentee Shawnee Tribe around Shawnee town, more than 100 are speakers; of the 1,500 members of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe in Ottawa County, there are only a few elderly speakers; of the 8,000 members of the Loyal Shawnee in the Cherokee region of Oklahoma around Whiteoak there are fewer than 12 speakers. All of these low figures, in addition to the fact that most speakers are older adults, make Shawnee an endangered language. Additionally, development outside of the home is limited; apart from a dictionary and portions of the Bible from 1842 to 1929, it appears that there is little literature or technology support for Shawnee.\n\nAbsentee-Shawnee Elder George Blanchard's Shawnee language classes were profiled on the PBS show \"The American Experience\" in 2009.

There are two third persons, proximate and obviative, and two noun classes (or genders), animate and inanimate. It is primarily agglutinating typologically, and is polysynthetic, resulting in a great deal of information being encoded on the verb. The most common word order is Verb-Subject.\n\nstem-(instrumental affix)-transitivizing affix-object affix <br>\nThe instrumental affix is not obligatory, but if it is present, it determines the type of transitivizing affix that can follow it, (see numbering scheme below) or by the last stem in the theme. <br>\nInstrumental affixes are as follows\n\n-tɵani (w)- 'bed'\n\nThe independent and imperative orders are used in independent clauses. The imperative order involves an understood second person affecting first or third persons. <br>\n<br>\nteke ki-e' -memekw-i <br>\nNEG 2-FUT-run -IMPER <br>\n'you mustn't run' <br>\n<br>\nteki-koos-i-ma <br>\nNEG run.from-IMPER-AO <br>\n'you mustn't run away from him' <br>\n<br>\nteke-wi'θen-i kola'-waapaki <br>\nNEG eat -IMPER early-morning <br>\n'you mustn't eat early in the morning' <br>\n<br>\nIndependent Mode: <br>\nInanimate Intransitive (II): <br>\n3s---> /-i/ ---> skwaaw-i 'it is red' <br>\n3p---> /-a/ ---> kinwaaw-a 'those are long'\n\nRefer to the examples below. 'Yaama' meaning 'this' in examples 1 and 2 refers to someone in front of the speaker. The repetition of 'yaama' in example 1 emphasizes the location of the referent in the immediate presence of the speaker. <br>\n<br>\n(1) yaama-kookwe-nee -θa -yaama <br>\nthis-strange-appearing-PERSON-this<br>\n'this stranger (the one right in front of me)' <br>\n<br>\n(2) mata-yaama-ha' -pa-skoolii-wi <br>\nnot this TIME-go-school- AI <br>\nni-oosθe' -0a <br>\n1-grandchild-PERSON <br>\n'this grandchild of mine does not go to school' <br>\n<br>\nRefer to the examples below.

'Hini' fulfills the same functions as above for inanimate nouns. Locational and third-person singular pronominal uses are found in the following examples. <br>\n<br>\nna'θaapi ni-[t]aay-a hini <br>\neven 1-REDUP-go that <br>\n'I would even go there' <br>\n<br>\nhini-h-i-si-ci-howe <br>\nthat [h]-say-thus-3-now <br>\n'(when) he said that (to me)'\n\nShawnee has a fairly free word order, with VSO being the most common: <br>\nteki koos -i -ma <br>\nNEG run.from-IMPER-AO <br>\n'run you from him' (in the negative) <br>\n'you mustn't run away from him' <br>\n<br>\nSOV, SVO, VOS, and OVS are also plausible.\n\nParts of speech in the Algonquian languages, Shawnee included, show a basic division between inflecting forms (nouns, verbs and pronouns), and non-inflecting invariant forms (also known as particles). Directional particles (\"piyeci\" meaning \"towards\") incorporate into the verb itself. Although particles are invariant in form, they have different distributions and meanings that correspond to adverbs (\"[hi]noki\" meaning \"now\", \"waapaki\" meaning \"today\", \"lakokwe\" meaning \"so, certainly\", \"mata\" meaning \"not\") postpositions (\"heta'koθaki wayeeci\" meaning \"towards the east\") and interjections (\"ce\" meaning \"so!\").\n\nExamples (1) and (2) below show the grammatical interaction of obviation and inverse. The narrative begins in (1) in which grandfather is the grammatical subject [+AGENT] in discourse-focus [+PROXIMATE]. In (2), grandfather remains in discourse-focus [+PROXIMATE], but he is now the grammatical object [+OBJECT]. To align grammatical relations properly in (2), the inverse marker /-ekw-/ is used in the verb stem to signal that the governor is affecting grandfather. (The prefix /ho-/ on 'ho-stakooli' refers to grandfather).\n\n(1) he-meci -naat-aw'ky-aa-ci hina ni-me'soom' -θa <br>\nSUB-COMPLETED-much-land -TA-3SUB that 1-grandfather-PERSON<br>\n'afterwards my grandfather received land' <br>\n<br>\n(2) wiikiwa ho-staa -ekw-a -li kapenalee-li<br>\nhouse 3-build-INV-DIR-3sOBV governor -3sOBV<br>\n'the governor built (him) a house' <br>\n(/-li/ is the obviative marker)<br>\n<br>\nSince the person building the house (the governor) is disjoint from the person who the house is being built for (the grandfather), this disjunction is marked by placing one participant in the obviative. Since grandfather is the focus in this narrative, the governor is assigned the obviative marking. Grammatically, 'kapenal-ee' (-ee- < -ile- < -ileni- 'person') is the subject who is not in discourse-focus (marked by /-li/ 3sOBVIATIVE), showing that grammatical relations and obviation are independent categories. <br>\n<br>\nSimilar interactions of inverse and obviation are found below. In Shawnee, third person animate beings participate in obviation, including grammatically animate nouns that are semantically inanimate. <br>\n<br>\nwe ni-cis-h -ekw-a hina weepikwa <br>\nthen 1-fear-CAUSE-INV-DIR- that spider <br>\n'then that spider scared me' <br>\n<br>\nho-waap-am-aa-li kisa'θwa-li <br>\n3-look -TA-DIR-3sOBV- sun -3sOBV <br>\n'he looked at the sun'\n\nThe Shawnee /-eki/ meaning \"in\" can be used with either gender. This locative affix cliticizes onto the preceding noun, and thus it appears to be a case ending. <br>\n<br>\ntekwakhwikan-eki<br>\nbox -in <br>\n'in a box' <br>\n<br>\nmsi-wikiwaap-eki <br>\nbig-house -in <br>\n'in a big house' <br>\n<br>\ntθene melo'kami-eki <br>\nevery spring -in <br>\n'every spring'\n\nThe basic distinction for gender in Shawnee is between animate actors and inanimate objects.<br>\n\nGrammatical gender in Shawnee is more accurately signaled by the \"phonology\", not the semantics.<br>\nNouns ending in /-a/ are animate, while nouns ending in /-i/ are inanimate. It should be noted that this phonological criterion is not absolute. Modification by a demonstrative (\"hina\" being animate and \"hini\" being inanimate, meaning \"that\") and pluralization are conclusive tests.<br>\n<br>\nIn the singular, Shawnee animate nouns end in /-a/, and the obviative singular morpheme is /-li/.<br>\nShawnee inanimate nouns are usually pluralized with stem +/-ali/. <br>\nThis causes animate obviative singular and inanimate plural to look alike on the surface.<br>\nexample<br>\n<br>\nanimate obviative singular<br>\nwiskilo'θa-li<br>\nbird<br>\n<br>\ninanimate plural<br>\nniipit-ali<br>\nmy teeth\n\nThe choice of person affix may depend on the relative position of agent and object on the animacy hierarchy. According to Dixon the animacy hierarchy extends from first person pronoun, second person pronoun, third person pronoun, proper nouns, human common nouns, animate common nouns, and inanimate common nouns.\n\nThe affixes in the verb will reflect whether an animate agent is acting on someone or something lower in the animacy scale, or whether he is being acted upon by someone or something lower in the animacy scale.\n\nDuring the 19th century a short-lived Roman-based alphabet was designed for Shawnee by the missionary Jotham Meeker. It was never widely used. Later, native Shawnee speaker Thomas 'Wildcat' Alford devised a highly phonemic and accurate orthography for his 1929 Shawnee translation of the four gospels of the New Testament, but it, too, never attained wide usage.\n\n"}

{"id": "567679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=567679", "title": "Sylheti language", "text": "Sylheti language\n\nSylheti (Sylheti: ꠍꠤꠟꠐꠤ, ) is an Indo-Aryan language, primarily spoken in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh and in the Barak Valley of the Indian state of Assam. There are substantial number of speakers in the Indian states of Meghalaya, Tripura and Manipur. A significant amount of Sylheti migration to the United Kingdom and the United States from the 20th century has made Sylheti one of the most spoken language or variety of the Bangladeshi diaspora.\n\nThe status of Sylheti is hotly disputed with some considering it a dialect of Bengali, while others consider it a separate language. There are significant differences in grammar and pronunciation as well as a lack of mutual intelligibility between the two varieties. There are greater differences between Sylheti and Bengali than between Sylheti and Assamese, which is recognised as a separate language. Most Sylhetis are at least bilingual to some degree, as Bengali is taught at all levels of education in Bangladesh. Sylhet was part of the ancient kingdom of Kamarupa, and Sylheti shares many common features with Assamese, including having a larger set of fricatives than other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages. According to George Abraham Grierson, \"The inflections also differ from those of regular Bengali, and in one or two instances assimilate to those of Assamese\". Considering the unique linguistic properties such as phoneme inventory, allophony, and inflectional morphology in particular and lexicon in general, Sylheti is often regarded as a separate language (Grierson 1928, Chatterjee 1939, Gordon 2005). Indeed, it was formerly written using its own script, Sylheti Nagari, which, although largely replaced with the Bengali script in recent times, is beginning to experience a revival in use. \n\nSylheti shares at least 80% of its lexicon with Bengali.\n\nSylheti is the common English spelling of the language name after the accepted British spelling of the Sylhet District. The Standard Bengali spelling of the name Sylheti is (). The Sylheti spelling is or ().\n\nIn ancient literature, Sylhet was referred as \"Shilahat\" and \"Shilahatta\". In the 19th century, the British tea-planters in the area referred to the vernacular spoken in Surma and Barak Valleys as Sylheti language. In Assam, the language is still referred to as \"Sylheti\".\n\nDuring the British colonial period, a Sylheti student by the name of Munshi Abdul Karim studying in London, England, after completing his education, spent several years in London and learned the printing trade. After returning home, he designed a woodblock type for Sylheti Nagari and founded the Islamia Press in Sylhet Town in about 1870. Other Sylheti presses were established in Sunamganj, Shillong and Kolkata. These presses fell out of use during the early 1970s. Since then, the Sylotinagri alphabet has been used mainly by linguists and academics. It gradually became very unpopular.\n\nThe script includes 5 independent vowels, 5 dependent vowels attached to a consonant letter and 27 consonants. The Sylheti abugida differs from the Bengali alphabet as it is a form of Kaithi, a script that belongs to the main group of North Indian scripts of Bihar. The writing system's main use was to record religious poetry, described as a rich language and easy to learn.\n\nCampaigns started to rise in London during the mid-1970s to mid-1980s to recognise Sylheti as a language in its own right. During the mid-1970s, when the first mother-tongue classes were established for Bangladeshis by community activists, the classes were given in standard Bengali rather than the Sylheti dialect which triggered the campaign. During the 1980s, a recognition campaign for Sylheti took place in the area of Spitalfields, East End of London. One of the main organisations was the Bangladeshis' Educational Needs in Tower Hamlets (usually known by its acronym as BENTH). However this organisation collapsed in 1985 and with its demise, the pro-Sylheti campaign in the borough lost impetus. Nonetheless, Sylheti remains very widespread as a domestic language in working-class as well as upper-class Sylheti households in the United Kingdom.\n\nA phrase in:\n\nwhich literally means \"one land's obscenity is another land's language\", and can be roughly translated to convey that a similar word in one language can mean something very different in another. For example:\n\n\"' কম্বল \"kômbôl\" in Standard Bengali means \"blanket\".\n\nThe following is a sample text in Sylheti, of the Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations:\n<br>Sylheti in Sylheti Nagari script<br>\nSylheti in Eastern Nagari script<br>\nSylheti in Phonetic Romanization<br>\nSylheti in IPA<br>\nBengali in Eastern Nagari script<br>\nBengali in Phonetic Romanization<br>\nBengali in IPA<br>\n\nBelow are the grammar similarities and differences appearing in a word to word comparison:\n<br>Sylheti word-to-word gloss<br>\nBengali word-to-word gloss<br>\n\nEnglish<br>\n\nSylheti is a tonal language. The Indo-Aryan languages are not generally recognized for tone. There are two way tonal contrasts in Sylheti: the emergence of high tone in the vowels following the loss of aspiration, and a low tone elsewhere.\nSylheti continues to have a long history of coexisting with other Tibeto-Burman languages such as various dialects of Kokborok, Reang which are tonal in nature. Even though there is no clear evidence of direct borrowing of lexical items from those tonal languages into Sylheti, there is still a possibility that the emergence of Sylheti tones is due to an areal feature as the indigenous speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages by and large use Sylheti as a common medium for interaction.\n\nSylheti is distinguished by its tonal characteristics and a wide range of fricative consonants corresponding to aspirated consonants in closely related languages and dialects such as Bengali; a lack of the breathy voiced stops; word-final stress; and a relatively large set of loanwords from Assamese, Standard Bengali and other Bengali dialects. Sylheti has affected the course of Standard Bengali in the rest of the state.\n\nA notable characteristic of spoken Sylheti is the correspondence of the (hereafter transliterated x), pronounced as an Voiceless epiglottal fricative to the , or \"sh\", of Bengali, e.g.\n\n"}
{"id": "29923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29923", "title": "Telepathy", "text": "Telepathy\n\nTelepathy (from the Greek τῆλε, \"tele\" meaning \"distant\" and πάθος, \"pathos\" or \"-patheia\" meaning \"feeling, perception, passion, affliction, experience\") is the purported transmission of information from one person to another without using any known human sensory channels or physical interaction. The term was coined in 1882 by the classical scholar Frederic W. H. Myers, a founder of the Society for Psychical Research, and has remained more popular than the earlier expression \"thought-transference\".\n\nTelepathy experiments have historically been criticized for lack of proper controls and repeatability. There is no convincing evidence that telepathy exists, and the topic is generally considered by the scientific community to be pseudoscience.\n\nAccording to historians such as Roger Luckhurst and Janet Oppenheim the origin of the concept of telepathy in Western civilization can be tracked to the late 19th century and the formation of the Society for Psychical Research. As the physical sciences made significant advances, scientific concepts were applied to mental phenomena (e.g., animal magnetism), with the hope that this would help to understand paranormal phenomena. The modern concept of telepathy emerged in this context.\n\nPsychical researcher Eric Dingwall criticized SPR founding members Frederic W. H. Myers and William F. Barrett for trying to \"prove\" telepathy rather than objectively analyze whether or not it existed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the magician and mentalist, Washington Irving Bishop would perform \"thought reading\" demonstrations. Bishop claimed no supernatural powers and ascribed his powers to muscular sensitivity (reading thoughts from unconscious bodily cues). Bishop was investigated by a group of scientists including the editor of the \"British Medical Journal\" and the psychologist Francis Galton. Bishop performed several feats successfully such as correctly identifying a selected spot on a table and locating a hidden object. During the experiment Bishop required physical contact with a subject who knew the correct answer. He would hold the hand or wrist of the helper. The scientists concluded that Bishop was not a genuine telepath but using a highly trained skill to detect ideomotor movements.\n\nAnother famous thought reader was the magician Stuart Cumberland. He was famous for performing blindfolded feats such as identifying a hidden object in a room that a person had picked out or asking someone to imagine a murder scene and then attempt to read the subject's thoughts and identify the victim and reenact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the Society for Psychical Research who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man cannot be read through telepathy, but only by muscle reading.\n\nIn the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by the Society for Psychical Research and believed to have genuine psychic ability. However, during a later experiment they were caught utilizing signal codes and they confessed to fraud. George Albert Smith and Douglas Blackburn were claimed to be genuine psychics by the Society for Psychical Research but Blackburn confessed to fraud:\n\nFor nearly thirty years the telepathic experiments conducted by Mr. G. A. Smith and myself have been accepted and cited as the basic evidence of the truth of thought transference...\n\n...the whole of those alleged experiments were bogus, and originated in the honest desire of two youths to show how easily men of scientific mind and training could be deceived when seeking for evidence in support of a theory they were wishful to establish.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1924, Gilbert Murray conducted 236 experiments into telepathy and reported 36% as successful, however, it was suggested that the results could be explained by hyperaesthesia as he could hear what was being said by the sender. Psychologist Leonard T. Troland had carried out experiments in telepathy at Harvard University which were reported in 1917. The subjects produced below chance expectations.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle and W. T. Stead were duped into believing Julius and Agnes Zancig had genuine psychic powers. Both Doyle and Stead wrote the Zancigs performed telepathy. In 1924, Julius and Agnes Zancig confessed that their mind reading act was a trick and published the secret code and all the details of the trick method they had used under the title of \"Our Secrets!!\" in a London newspaper.\n\nIn 1924, Robert H. Gault of Northwestern University with Gardner Murphy conducted the first American radio test for telepathy. The results were entirely negative. One of their experiments involved the attempted thought transmission of a chosen number, out of 2010 replies none were correct.\n\nIn February 1927, with the co-operation of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), V. J. Woolley who was at the time the Research Officer for the SPR, arranged a telepathy experiment in which radio listeners were asked to take part. The experiment involved 'agents' thinking about five selected objects in an office at Tavistock Square, whilst listeners on the radio were asked to identify the objects from the BBC studio at Savoy Hill. 24, 659 answers were received. The results revealed no evidence for telepathy.\n\nA famous experiment in telepathy was recorded by the American author Upton Sinclair in his book \"Mental Radio\" which documents Sinclair's test of psychic abilities of Mary Craig Sinclair, his second wife. She attempted to duplicate 290 pictures which were drawn by her husband. Sinclair claimed Mary successfully duplicated 65 of them, with 155 \"partial successes\" and 70 failures. However, these experiments were not conducted in a controlled scientific laboratory environment. Science writer Martin Gardner suggested that the possibility of sensory leakage during the experiment had not been ruled out:\n\nThe Turner-Ownbey long distance telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. May Frances Turner positioned herself in the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and write it down whilst Ownbey would write her guesses. The scores were highly successful and both records were supposed to be sent to J. B. Rhine; however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.\n\nAnother example is the experiment carried out by the author Harold Sherman with the explorer Hubert Wilkins who carried out their own experiment in telepathy for five and a half months starting in October 1937. This took place when Sherman was in New York and Wilkins was in the Arctic. The experiment consisted of Sherman and Wilkins at the end of each day to relax and visualise a mental image or \"thought impression\" of the events or thoughts they had experienced in the day and then to record those images and thoughts on paper in a diary. The results at the end when comparing Sherman's and Wilkins' diaries were claimed to be more than 60 percent.\n\nThe full results of the experiments were published in 1942 in a book by Sherman and Wilkins titled \"Thoughts Through Space\". In the book both Sherman and Wilkins had written they believed they had demonstrated that it was possible to send and receive thought impressions from the mind of one person to another. The magician John Booth wrote the experiment was not an example of telepathy as a high percentage of misses had occurred. Booth wrote it was more likely that the \"hits\" were the result of \"coincidence, law of averages, subconscious expectancy, logical inference or a plain lucky guess\". A review of their book in the \"American Journal of Orthopsychiatry\" cast doubt on their experiment noting \"the study was published five years after it was conducted, arouses suspicion on the validity of the conclusions.\n\nIn 1948, on the BBC radio Maurice Fogel made the claim that he could demonstrate telepathy. This intrigued the journalist Arthur Helliwell who wanted to discover his methods. He found that Fogel's mind reading acts were all based on trickery, he relied on information about members of his audience before the show started. Helliwell exposed Fogel's methods in a newspaper article. Although Fogel managed to fool some people into believing he could perform genuine telepathy, the majority of his audience knew he was a showman.\n\nIn a series of experiments Samuel Soal and his assistant K. M. Goldney examined 160 subjects over 128,000 trials and obtained no evidence for the existence of telepathy. Soal tested Basil Shackleton and Gloria Stewart between 1941 and 1943 in over five hundred sittings and over twenty thousand guesses. Shackleton scored 2890 compared with a chance expectation of 2308 and Gloria scored 9410 compared with a chance level of 7420. It was later discovered the results had been tampered with. Gretl Albert who was present during many of the experiments said she had witnessed Soal altering the records during the sessions. Betty Marwick discovered Soal had not used the method of random selection of numbers as he had claimed. Marwick showed that there had been manipulation of the score sheets \"all the experiments reported by Soal had thereby been discredited.\"\n\nIn 1979 the physicists John G. Taylor and Eduardo Balanovski wrote the only scientifically feasible explanation for telepathy could be electromagnetism (EM) involving EM fields. In a series of experiments the EM levels were many orders of magnitude lower than calculated and no paranormal effects were observed. Both Taylor and Balanovski wrote their results were a strong argument against the validity of telepathy.\n\nResearch in anomalistic psychology has discovered that in some cases telepathy can be explained by a covariation bias. In an experiment (Schienle \"et al\". 1996) 22 believers and 20 skeptics were asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and the corresponding feedback given by a receiver. According to the results the believers overestimated the number of successful transmissions whilst the skeptics made accurate hit judgments. The results from another telepathy experiment involving 48 undergraduate college students (Rudski, 2002) were explained by hindsight and confirmation biases.\n\nWithin the field of parapsychology, telepathy is considered to be a form of extrasensory perception (ESP) or anomalous cognition in which information is transferred through Psi. It is often categorized similarly to precognition and clairvoyance. Experiments have been used to test for telepathic abilities. Among the most well known are the use of Zener cards and the Ganzfeld experiment.\n\nParapsychology describes several forms of telepathy:\n\n\nZener cards are marked with five distinctive symbols. When using them, one individual is designated the \"sender\" and another the \"receiver\". The sender selects a random card and visualize the symbol on it, while the receiver attempts to determine that symbol using Psi. Statistically, the receiver has a 20% chance of randomly guessing the correct symbol, so to demonstrate telepathy, they must repeatedly score a success rate that is significantly higher than 20%. If not conducted properly, this method can be vulnerable to sensory leakage and card counting.\n\nJ. B. Rhine's experiments with Zener cards were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues. Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects. Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.\n\nParapsychological studies into dream telepathy were carried out at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York led by Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy. However, the results have not been independently replicated. The psychologist James Alcock has written the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and \"lack of replication is rampant.\"\n\nThe picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.\n\nAn attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level. Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.\n\nWhen using the Ganzfeld experiment to test for telepathy, one individual is designated the receiver and is placed inside a controlled environment where they are deprived of sensory input, and another is designated the sender and is placed in a separate location. The receiver is then required to receive information from the sender. The nature of the information may vary between experiments.\n\nThe ganzfeld experiment studies that were examined by Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton had methodological problems that were well documented. Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues. Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 ganzfeld experiments and to access each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate documentation, randomization and security as well as possibilities of sensory leakage. Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi.\n\nPossibilities of sensory leakage in the ganzfeld experiments included the receivers hearing what was going on in the sender's room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender's fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see.\n\nHyman also reviewed the autoganzfeld experiments and discovered a pattern in the data that implied a visual cue may have taken place:\n\nHyman wrote the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage. In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 produced hits, corresponding to a hit rate of 32.2%. This hit rate is statistically significant with p < .001. Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics thought to be psi-conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the ganzfeld condition. Hyman (2010) published a rebuttal to Storm \"et al\". According to Hyman \"reliance on meta-analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious. It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence.\" Hyman wrote the ganzfeld studies have not been independently replicated and have failed to produce evidence for telepathy. Storm \"et al\". published a response to Hyman claiming the ganzfeld experimental design has proved to be consistent and reliable but parapsychology is a struggling discipline that has not received much attention so further research on the subject is necessary. Rouder \"et al\". 2013 wrote that critical evaluation of Storm \"et al\".'s meta-analysis reveals no evidence for telepathy, no plausible mechanism and omitted replication failures.\n\nA 2016 paper examined questionable research practices in the ganzfeld experiments.\n\nTwin telepathy is a belief that has been described as a myth in psychological literature. Psychologists Stephen Hupp and Jeremy Jewell have noted that all experiments on the subject have failed to provide any scientific evidence for telepathy between twins. According to Hupp and Jewell there are various behavioral and genetic factors that contribute to the twin telepathy myth \"identical twins typically spend a lot of time together and are usually exposed to very similar environments. Thus, it's not at all surprising that they act in similar ways and are adept at anticipating and forecasting each other's reactions to events.\"\n\nA 1993 study by Susan Blackmore investigated the claims of twin telepathy. In an experiment with six sets of twins one subject would act as the sender and the other the receiver. The sender was given selected objects, photographs or numbers and would attempt to psychically send the information to the receiver. The results from the experiment were negative, no evidence of telepathy was observed.\n\nThe skeptical investigator Benjamin Radford has noted that \"Despite decades of research trying to prove telepathy, there is no credible scientific evidence that psychic powers exist, either in the general population or among twins specifically. The idea that two people who shared their mother's womb — or even who share the same DNA — have a mysterious mental connection is an intriguing one not borne out in science.\"\n\nA variety of tests have been performed to demonstrate telepathy, but there is no scientific evidence that the power exists. A panel commissioned by the United States National Research Council to study paranormal claims concluded that \"despite a 130-year record of scientific research on such matters, our committee could find no scientific justification for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mental telepathy or 'mind over matter' exercises... Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist.\" The scientific community considers parapsychology a pseudoscience. There is no known mechanism for telepathy. Philosopher and physicist Mario Bunge has written that telepathy would contradict laws of science and the claim that \"signals can be transmitted across space without fading with distance is inconsistent with physics\".\n\nPhysicist John Taylor has written the experiments that have been claimed by parapsychologists to support evidence for the existence of telepathy are based on the use of shaky statistical analysis and poor design, and attempts to duplicate such experiments by the scientific community have failed. Taylor also wrote the arguments used by parapsychologists for the feasibility of such phenomena are based on distortions of theoretical physics as well as \"complete ignorance\" of relevant areas of physics.\n\nPsychologist Stuart Sutherland wrote that cases of telepathy can be explained by people underestimating the probability of coincidences. According to Sutherland, \"most stories about this phenomenon concern people who are close to one another - husband and wife or brother and sister. Since such people have much in common, it is highly probable that they will sometimes think the same thought at the same time.\" Graham Reed, a specialist in anomalistic psychology, noted that experiments into telepathy often involve the subject relaxing and reporting the 'messages' to consist of colored geometric shapes. Reed wrote that these are a common type of hypnagogic image and not evidence for telepathic communication.\n\nOutside of parapsychology, telepathy is generally explained as the result of fraud, self-delusion and/or self-deception and not as a paranormal power. Psychological research has also revealed other explanations such as confirmation bias, expectancy bias, sensory leakage, subjective validation and wishful thinking. Virtually all of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena, such as mediumship, can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as cold reading. Magicians such as Ian Rowland and Derren Brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, without paranormal means. They have identified, described, and developed psychological techniques of cold reading and hot reading.\n\nThe notion of telepathy is not dissimilar to two clinical concepts: delusions of thought insertion/removal. This similarity might explain how an individual might come to the conclusion that they were experiencing telepathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of psychosis, particularly of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or substance-induced psychosis. Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out of their minds or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic medication. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists believe and empirical findings support the idea that people with schizotypy and schizotypal personality disorder are particularly likely to believe in telepathy.\n\nTelepathy is a common theme in modern fiction and science fiction, with many extraterrestrials (such as the Protoss in the \"StarCraft\" franchise), superheroes, and supervillains having telepathic ability.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "199353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199353", "title": "Ubykh language", "text": "Ubykh language\n\nUbykh, or Ubyx, is an extinct Northwest Caucasian language once spoken by the Ubykh people (who originally lived along the eastern coast of the Black Sea before migrating \"en masse\" to Turkey in the 1860s).\n\nThe Ubykh language is ergative and polysynthetic, with a high degree of agglutination, with polypersonal verbal agreement and a very large number of distinct consonants but only two phonemically distinct vowels. With around eighty consonants, it has one of the largest inventories of consonants in the world, the largest number for any language without clicks.\n\nThe name Ubykh is derived from (), its name in the Abdzakh Adyghe language. It is known in linguistic literature by many names: variants of Ubykh, such as \"Ubikh\", (Turkish) and (French); and \"Pekhi\" (from Ubykh ) and its Germanised variant .\n\nUbykh is distinguished by the following features, some of which are shared with other Northwest Caucasian languages:\n\n\nUbykh has 84 phonemic consonants, a record high amongst languages without click consonants, but only 2 phonemic vowels. Four of these consonants are found only in loanwords and onomatopoeiae. There are nine basic places of articulation for the consonants and extensive use of secondary articulation, such that Ubykh has 20 different uvular phonemes. Ubykh distinguishes three types of postalveolar consonants: apical, laminal, and laminal closed. Regarding the vowels, since there are only two phonemic vowels, there is a great deal of allophony.\n\nUbykh is agglutinative and polysynthetic: ('we will not be able to go back'), ('if you had said it'). Ubykh is often extremely concise in its word forms.\n\nThe boundaries between nouns and verbs in Ubykh is somewhat blurred. Any noun can be used as the root of a stative verb ( 'child', 'I was a child'), and many verb roots can become nouns simply by the use of noun affixes ( 'to say', 'what I say').\n\nThe noun system in Ubykh is quite simple. Ubykh has three noun cases (the oblique-ergative case may be two homophonous cases with differing function, thus presenting four cases in total):\n\nThe instrumental case (-) was also treated as a case in Dumézil (1975). Another pair of postpositions, - ('to[wards]') and - ('for'), have been noted as synthetic datives (e.g. 'I will send it to the prince'), but their status as cases is also best discounted.\n\nNouns do not distinguish grammatical gender. The definite article is (e.g. 'the man'). There is no indefinite article directly equivalent to the English \"a\" or \"an\", but -(root)- (literally 'one'-(root)-'certain') translates French \"un\" and Turkish \"bir\": e.g. ('a certain young man').\n\nNumber is only marked on the noun in the ergative case, with -. The number marking of the absolutive argument is either by suppletive verb roots (e.g. 'he is in the car' vs. 'they are in the car') or by verb suffixes: ('he goes'), ('they go'). The second person plural prefix - triggers this plural suffix regardless of whether that prefix represents the ergative, the absolutive, or an oblique argument: \nNote that, in this last sentence, the plurality of \"it\" (-) is obscured; the meaning can be either 'I give \"it\" to you all' or 'I give \"them\" to you all'.\n\nAdjectives, in most cases, are simply suffixed to the noun: ('pepper') with ('red') becomes ('red pepper'). Adjectives do not decline.\n\nPostpositions are rare; most locative semantic functions, as well as some non-local ones, are provided with preverbal elements: ('you wrote it for me'). However, there are a few postpositions: ('like me'), ('near the prince').\n\nA past-present-future distinction of verb tense exists (the suffixes - and - represent past and future) and an imperfective aspect suffix is also found (-, which can combine with tense suffixes). Dynamic and stative verbs are contrasted, as in Arabic, and verbs have several nominal forms. Morphological causatives are not uncommon. The conjunctions ('and') and ('but') are usually given with verb suffixes, but there is also a free particle corresponding to each:\n\nPronominal benefactives are also part of the verbal complex, marked with the preverb -, but a benefactive cannot normally appear on a verb that has three agreement prefixes already.\n\nGender only appears as part of the second person paradigm, and then only at the speaker's discretion. The feminine second person index is -, which behaves like other pronominal prefixes: ('he gives [it] to you [normal; gender-neutral] for me'), but compare 'he gives [it] to you [feminine] for me').\n\nA few meanings covered in English by adverbs or auxiliary verbs are given in Ubykh by verb suffixes:\n\n\nQuestions may be marked grammatically, using verb suffixes or prefixes:\n\n\nOther types of questions, involving the pronouns 'where' and 'what', may also be marked only in the verbal complex: ('where are you going?'), ('what had you said?').\n\nMany local, prepositional, and other functions are provided by preverbal elements providing a large series of applicatives, and here Ubykh shows remarkable complexity. Two main types of preverbal elements exist in Ubykh: determinants and preverbs. The number of preverbs is limited, and mainly show location and direction. The number of determinants is also limited, but the class is more open; some determinant prefixes include - ('with regard to a horse') and - ('with regard to the foot or base of an object').\n\nFor simple locations, there are a number of possibilities that can be encoded with preverbs, including (but not limited to):\nThere is also a separate directional preverb meaning 'towards the speaker': -, which occupies a separate slot in the verbal complex. However, preverbs can have meanings that would take up entire phrases in English. The preverb - signifies 'on the earth' or 'in the earth', for instance: ('they buried his body'; literally, \"they put his body in the earth\"). Even more narrowly, the preverb - signifies that an action is done out of, into or with regard to a fire: ('I take a brand out of the fire').\n\nWriting systems for the Ubykh language have been proposed, but there has never been a standard written form.\n\nUbykh syllables have a strong tendency to be CV, although VC and CVC also exist. Consonant clusters are not as large as in Abzhywa Abkhaz or in Georgian, rarely being larger than two terms. Three-term clusters exist in two words - ('sun') and ('to swell up'), but the latter is a loan from Adyghe, and the former more often pronounced when it appears alone.\nCompounding plays a large part in Ubykh and, indeed, in all Northwest Caucasian semantics. There is no verb equivalent to English \"to love\", for instance; one says \"I love you\" as ('I see you well').\n\nReduplication occurs in some roots, often those with onomatopoeic values (, 'to curry[comb]' from 'to scrape'; , 'to cluck like a chicken' [a loan from Adyghe]); and , 'to croak like a frog').\n\nRoots and affixes can be as small as one phoneme. The word , 'they give you to him', for instance, contains six phonemes, each a separate morpheme:\n\n\nHowever, some words may be as long as seven syllables (although these are usually compounds): ('staircase').\n\nAs with all other languages, Ubykh is replete with idioms. The word ('door'), for instance, is an idiom meaning either \"magistrate\", \"court\", or \"government.\" However, idiomatic constructions are even more common in Ubykh than in most other languages; the representation of abstract ideas with series of concrete elements is a characteristic of the Northwest Caucasian family. As mentioned above, the phrase meaning \"I love you\" translates literally as 'I see you well'; similarly, \"you please me\" is literally 'you cut my heart'. The term ('Russian'), a Turkish loan, has come to be a slang term meaning \"infidel\", \"non-Muslim\" or \"enemy\" (see History below).\n\nThe majority of loanwords in Ubykh are derived from either Adyghe or Turkish, with smaller numbers from Persian, Abkhaz, and the South Caucasian languages. Towards the end of Ubykh's life, a large influx of Adyghe words was noted; Vogt (1963) notes a few hundred examples. The phonemes were borrowed from Turkish and Adyghe. also appears to come from Adyghe, although it seems to have arrived earlier on. It is possible, too, that is a loan from Adyghe, since most of the few words with this phoneme are obvious Adyghe loans: ('proud'), ('testis').\n\nMany loanwords have Ubykh equivalents, but were dwindling in usage under the influence of Turkish, Circassian, and Russian equivalents:\n\nSome words, usually much older ones, are borrowed from less influential stock: Colarusso (1994) sees ('pig') as a borrowing from a proto-Semitic *\"huka\", and ('slave') from an Iranian root; however, Chirikba (1986) regards the latter as being of Abkhaz origin ( ← Abkhaz \"agər-wa\" 'lower cast of peasants; slave', literally 'Megrelian').\n\nIn the scheme of Northwest Caucasian evolution, despite its parallels with Adyghe and Abkhaz, Ubykh forms a separate third branch of the family. It has fossilised palatal class markers where all other Northwest Caucasian languages preserve traces of an original labial class: the Ubykh word for 'heart', , corresponds to the reflex in Abkhaz, Abaza, Adyghe, and Kabardian. Ubykh also possesses groups of pharyngealised consonants. All other NWC languages possess true pharyngeal consonants, but Ubykh is the only language to use pharyngealisation as a feature of secondary articulation.\n\nWith regard to the other languages of the family, Ubykh is closer to Adyghe and Kabardian but shares many features with Abkhaz due to geographic influence; many later Ubykh speakers were bilingual in Ubykh and Adyghe.\n\nWhile not many dialects of Ubykh existed, one divergent dialect of Ubykh has been noted (in Dumézil 1965:266-269). Grammatically, it is similar to standard Ubykh (i.e. Tevfik Esenç's dialect), but has a very different sound system, which had collapsed into just 62-odd phonemes:\n\nUbykh was spoken in the eastern coast of the Black Sea around Sochi until 1864, when the Ubykhs were driven out of the region by the Russians. They eventually came to settle in Turkey, founding the villages of Hacı Osman, Kırkpınar, Masukiye and Hacı Yakup. Turkish and Circassian eventually became the preferred languages for everyday communication, and many words from these languages entered Ubykh in that period.\n\nThousands of pages of material and many audio recordings had been collected and collated by a number of linguists, including Georges Charachidzé, Georges Dumézil, Hans Vogt, George Hewitt and A. Sumru Özsoy, with the help of some of its last speakers, particularly Tevfik Esenç and Huseyin Kozan. Ubykh was never written by its speech community, but a few phrases were transcribed by Evliya Celebi in his Seyahatname and a substantial portion of the oral literature, along with some cycles of the Nart saga, was transcribed. Tevfik Esenç also eventually learned to write Ubykh in the transcription that Dumézil devised.\n\nJulius von Mészáros, a Hungarian linguist, visited Turkey in 1930 and took down some notes on Ubykh. His work \"Die Päkhy-Sprache\" was extensive and accurate to the extent allowed by his transcription system (which could not represent all the phonemes of Ubykh) and marked the foundation of Ubykh linguistics.\n\nThe Frenchman Georges Dumézil also visited Turkey in 1930 to record some Ubykh and would eventually become the most celebrated Ubykh linguist. He published a collection of Ubykh folktales in the late 1950s, and the language soon attracted the attention of linguists for its small number (two) of phonemic vowels. Hans Vogt, a Norwegian, produced a monumental dictionary that, in spite of its many errors (later corrected by Dumézil), is still one of the masterpieces and essential tools of Ubykh linguistics.\n\nLater in the 1960s and into the early 1970s, Dumézil published a series of papers on Ubykh etymology in particular and Northwest Caucasian etymology in general. Dumézil's book \"Le Verbe Oubykh\" (1975), a comprehensive account of the verbal and nominal morphology of the language, is another cornerstone of Ubykh linguistics.\n\nSince the 1980s, Ubykh linguistics has slowed drastically. No other major treatises have been published; however, the Dutch linguist Rieks Smeets is currently trying to compile a new Ubykh dictionary based on Vogt's 1963 book, and a similar project is also underway in Australia. The Ubykh themselves have shown interest in relearning their language.\n\nThe Abkhaz writer Bagrat Shinkuba's historical novel Bagrat Shinkuba. \"The Last of the Departed\" treats the fate of the Ubykh people.\n\nPeople who have published literature on Ubykh include\n\nUbykh has been cited in the \"Guinness Book of Records\" (1996 ed.) as the language with the most consonant phonemes, although it may have fewer than some of the Khoisan languages. It has 20 uvular and 29 pure fricative phonemes, more than any other known language.\n\nAll examples from Dumézil 1968.\n\n\n\n"}

He received his Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from Harvard University, where he administered the Dudley House fellowship program during the Mastership of Jean Mayer. Dowling is a past fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the University of Edinburgh and the National Humanities Center, and has held Guggenheim, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Howard Foundation fellowships. In 1994-95, he was Senior Fulbright Lecturer in American Literature at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid He is past winner of the Richard Beale Davis Prize for work in early American literature and a New Jersey Council of the Humanities award for his book \"Oliver Wendell Holmes in Paris: Medicine, Theology, and the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table\"; In 2012 he was the recipient of the Drake Group's Robert Maynard Hutchins Award for his part in the struggle against Div IA athletics corruption in American higher education.\n\nDowling came to national attention in the 1990s through his work with the Rutgers 1000 campaign which fought for the removal of Division I sports from Rutgers.\n\nIn September 2007, a controversy arose when Rutgers Athletic Director Robert Mulcahy accused Dowling of racism for having dismissed, in a \"New York Times\" interview, the claim that athletic scholarships provide educational opportunities for minority students: \"If you were giving the scholarship to an intellectually brilliant kid who happens to play a sport, that's fine. But they give it to a functional illiterate who can't read a cereal box, and then make him spend 50 hours a week on physical skills. That's not opportunity. If you want to give financial help to minorities, go find the ones who are at the library after school.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal labeled Mulcahy's attack a \"campaign of character assassination\" against a professor who had spoken out against athletics corruption at his university. In New Jersey, Dowling was most memorably defended by Donald and Roscoe Brown, in a column in the Trenton Times (2 October 2007): \"I -- and many other blacks -- agree with Professor Dowling, that if Rutgers were serious about enhancing the development of a black intelligentsia, it would start recruiting 'black kids found in the library after school' as aggressively as it does black kids whose primary attributes are an ability to run fast and/or to jump high. Right on, Brother Dowling.\"\n\nThe Rutgers administration responded by releasing announcements stating that Rutgers ranks highly among state universities in the Academic Progress Report rankings compiled by the NCAA for the use of member schools.\n\n\"Confessions of a Spoilsport: My Life and Hard Times Fighting Sports Corruption at an Old Eastern University\", Dowling's memoir of the Rutgers 1000 campaign, was the occasion of a long personal interview in \"Inside Higher Education,\" and received substantial coverage in \"The New York Times,\" \"The Weekly Standard\", \"The Manchester Guardian\", and other publications.
