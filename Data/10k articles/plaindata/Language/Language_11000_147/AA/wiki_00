{"id": "31933776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31933776", "title": "A-not-A question", "text": "A-not-A question\n\nIn linguistics, an A-not-A question is a polar question that offers two opposite possibilities for the answer. This disjunctive question is predominantly found in Sinitic languages that offers a choice between an affirmative predicate and its negative counterpart. They are functionally regarded as a type of \"yes/no\" question as they are very similar to a large extent. \"A-not-A\" questions are often interpreted as having a 'neutral' presupposition or is used in a neutral context. This means that the person asking the A-not-A question does not assume the truth value of the proposition expressed by the question. The “A-not-A” question structure is commonly found in Chinese. The overarching principle is the contrasting of the positive and negative form of a premise side by side. A-not-A questions have a special interrogative type pattern of which YES/NO answers are not permitted, and instead requires an echo response. Therefore, to properly answer the query, the recipient must select the positive (affirmative form “A”) or negative (negative predicate form “not-A”) version and use it in the formation of their response.\n\nAn example of an A-not-A question in English is in (1.a) \"Are you happy or sad?\". The response to this question must be an echo answer, stating either \"I am happy,\" or the correct alternative, \"I am sad\". In other words, this sentence is a leading question, where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. In contrast, (1.b) \"Are you happy or not?\" is a neutral question where the answer to this can be yes or no in response to the first and more explicitly stated alternative.\n\nA-not-A questions are not usually used in English, but the following example shows how A-not-A questions are answered.\n\nAs seen in this example, simply answering \"Yes\" or \"No\" does not suffice as a response to the question. This question must be answered in the \"A\" or \"not A\" form. If this question was asked in the A-not-A pattern, its direct form would be \"Did John eat or not eat the beans?\"\n\nIn forming A-not-A questions, \"A\" must remain the same on both sides. \"A\" is essentially a variable which can be replaced with a grammatical particle such as a modal, adverb, adjective, verb, or preposition.\n\nIn Chinese, there are 6 attested patterns of A-not-A: A-not-A, AB-not-AB, A-not-AB, AB-not-A, a-not-A, and a-not-AB of which \"A\" stands for the full form of the predicate, \"B\" stands for the complement, and \"a\" stands for the first syllable of a disyllabic predicate.\n\n (3) 你 去 不 去？ \n\n (4) 你 認得 \"這 個 人\" 不 認得 \"這 個 人\" ？ \n\n (5) 你 認得 不 認得 \"這 個 人\" ？ \n\n (6) 你 認得 \"這 個 人\" 不 認得 ? \n\n (7) 不 知道 你 方 不 方便？ \n\n (8) 你 看 這裡 合不 合適 \"教 拳\"? \n\nA-not-A can be formed by a verb, an adjective, or an adverb, as well as modals.\n\nIn the interrogative clause, A-not-A occurs by repeating the first part in the verbal group (with the option of an auxiliary) and the negative form of the particle is placed in between. However, this clause does not apply when using perfective in aspect. Instead, 沒有 \"meiyou\" is used to replace the repeated verb used in A-not-A form.\n\nHere, the verb \"go\" is \"A\", and there is no object.\n\nHere, the verb \"watch\" is \"A\", and while there is an object, the object is not included in \"A\", and is therefore not reduplicated.\n\nHere, the verb \"watch\" is \"A\", and while the object is included before NEG, it is not included in \"A\", and is therefore not reduplicated. Reduplication is optional here.\n\nHere, the verb \"watch\" is \"A\", and while the object is included before NEG, it is not included in \"A\", and is therefore not reduplicated. \"A\" is reduplicated here.\n\nThere is some debate amongst speakers as to whether or not 3.d. is grammatical, and Gasde argues that it is.\n\nHere, the adjective \"good\" is \"A\", and it is reduplicated. The word \"ben\" is a classifier, which means it is a counter word for the Noun \"book.\"\n\nHere, the adjective \"good\" is \"A\", but it is not reduplicated.\n\nHere, the preposition \"at\" is \"A\", and it is reduplicated.\n\nHere, the preposition \"at\" is \"A\", and it is not reduplicated.\n\nHere, the modal \"dare\" is \"A\" and it is reduplicated.\n\nDespite having the same negative marker as Standard Chinese, \"不\" \"bat1\" is only used in fixed expressions or to give literacy quality. And only \"唔\" \"m4\" is used as a negative marker in A-not-A questions.\n\nOne distinction in Cantonese when compared to Standard Chinese is that certain forms of A-not-A questions are not attested due to dialectal differences.\n\nLike it's Standard Chinese counterpart, this form is attested in Cantonese as shown by the sentence pair in (13).\n\nAs shown by (14.a), this is not an attested form in Cantonese, unlike the counterpart in Standard Chinese in (14.b).\n\nThis form is only attested in Cantonese if the predicate is a monosyllabic word as shown by (15.a), compared to the Standard Chinese counterpart in (15.b).\n\nA-not-AB is not attested in Cantonese if the predicate is a bi-syllabic word as shown by (16.a), unlike it's Standard Chinese counterpart in (16.b). In such cases, Cantonese speakers usually use the form a-not-AB, like (19).\n\nThis form is only attested if the predicate is a monosyllabic word (\"A\") with an object (\"B\") as shown by the sentence pair with its Standard Chinese counterpart in (17).\n\nNote that such forms of AB-not-A in monosyllabic word is used by the old generation.\n\nWhen the predicate is a bi-syllabic word, then AB-not-A form is not attested as shown in (18.a), unlike it's Standard Chinese counterpart in (18.b).\n\nThis form is attested in both Cantonese and its Standard Chinese counterpart as shown in the sentence pair in (18).\n\nThis form is attested in both Cantonese and its Standard Chinese as shown in the sentence pair in (19).\n\nThere are three salient morphological varieties of A-not-A question in Korean. And like all A-not-A questions, the questions cannot be answered with Yes (\"네\" Ney) or No (\"아니요\" Anyo)\n\nBoth \"an\" and \"mos\" can precede the predicate in A-not-A\n\n\"An\", short form for \"ani-\", expresses simple negation\n\n\"Mos\" expresses impossibility or inability\n\nKorean has three negative predicates that can form A-not-A question, \"molu-\", \"eps-\", and \"ani-\"\n\n\"Molu-\" means \"don't know\"\n\n\"Esp-\" means \"do not have; do not exist\"\n\n\"Ani-\" means \"is not\"\n\nMeaning \"desist from\", \"mal\" follows an affirmative polar question, and will occur instead of a reduplicated full verb that has a post predicate negation. This means that there is only one full verb in this type of A-not-A question.\nHowever, the modal auxiliary verb \"mal\" is restricted in that it does not co-occur in predicative adjectives or the factual complementizer \"ni\". Moreover, with \"mal\" being a bound form, it cannot be the echo negative answer. Instead, the full negative verb will be provided as the answer, taking \"an-\" negation, as illustrated in (26)\n\nOne analysis of the formation of the A-not-A construction is the post-syntactic approach, through two stages of M-merger. First, the A-not-A operator targets the MWd which is the head that is closest to it and undergoes lowering. Then, reduplication occurs to yield the surface form of the A-not-A question.\n\nTseng suggests A-not-A occurs post-syntactically, at the morphological level. It is movement that occurs overtly at the phonetic form, after the syntactic movement has occurred. A-not-A is a feature of T that operates on the closest, c-commanded morphosyntactic words (MWd), and not subwords (SWd). The elements that undergo post-syntactic movement are morphosyntactic words (MWd). A node X is a MWd iff X is the highest segment and X is not contained in another X. A node X is a SWd if X is a terminal node and not an MWd. The A-not-A operation is a MWd to MWd movement.\n\nThe A-not-A operator is defined as an MWd. The A-not-A operator can only lower to a MWd which is immediately dominated by the maximal projection that is also immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. An SWd cannot be the target for the A-not-A operator. In addition, if there is an intervening MWd or SWd between the A-not-A operator and its target, the A-not-A operation fails.\n\nA-not-A operator lowering must satisfy four conditions:\n\n\nAfter lowering, the A-not-A operator triggers reduplication on the target node. The reduplication domain can be the first syllable of the targeted element, the targeted element itself, and the maximal projection that contains the targeted element. Reduplication is linear and the A-not-A operator cannot skip the adjacent constituent to copy the next constituent.\n\nIn first syllable reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the first syllable of the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant, the copied syllable, to the left of the base MWd. Then the negation is inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In fig. (1.a) The A-not-A operator copies the first syllable \"tao\" of the MWd \"taoyan\". The reduplicant \"tao\" is put at the left of the base \"taoyan\" and then the negative constituent \"bu\" is inserted in between. In fig. (1.b) \"*Zhangsan taoyan Lisi-bu-tao\" is ungrammatical because \"tao\" cannot be put to the right of the maximal projection VP, \"taoyan Lisi\".\n\nIn MWd reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant MWd overtly to the left of the base MWd or to right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. Otherwise, the reduplicant can move covertly, not spelled-out, to the right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (9.a) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd \"taoyan\". The reduplicant \"taoyan\" is overtly put at the left of the base \"taoyan\" and then the negative constituent \"bu\" is inserted in between. In (9.b) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd \"taoyan\". The reduplicant \"taoyan\" is overtly put at the right of the base \"taoyan Lisi\" and then the negative constituent \"bu\" is inserted in between. In (9.c) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd \"taoyan\". The reduplicant \"taoyan\", not spelled-out here, is covertly put at the right of the base \"taoyan Lisi\" and then the negative constituent \"bu\" is inserted.\n\nIn maximal projection reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the maximal projection that contains the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant either to the left or to the right of the base. The base may be just the MWd or the maximal projection containing the MWd. The maximal projection may be any XP (VP, AP, PP etc.). The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (10.a) the A-not-A operator copies the maximal projection VP \"taoyan Lisi\". The reduplicant \"taoyan Lisi\" is put at the left of the base \"taoyan Lisi\" and then the negative constituent \"bu\" is inserted in between.\n\n"}

The second proposition may be considered \"weaker,\" and therefore the arguer utilises the former as the \"stronger\" proposition from which the second proposition is deduced.\n\n\nIn the English language, the phrase \"a fortiori\" is most often used as an adverbial phrase meaning \"by even greater force of logic\" or \"all the more so\".\n\nBryan A. Garner has written in \"Garner's Modern American Usage\" that writers sometimes use \"a fortiori\" as an adjective, which he says is \"a usage to be resisted.\" As an example of this he gives the sentence, \"Clearly, if laws depend so heavily on public acquiescence, the case of conventions is an \"a fortiori\" [read \"even more compelling\"] one.\"\n\n\"A fortiori\" arguments are regularly used in Jewish law under the name kal va-chomer, literally \"mild and severe\", the mild case being the one we know about, while trying to infer about the more severe case.\nIn ancient Indian logic (nyaya), an inference derived from an \"a fortiori\" postulation is known as \"kaimutika\" or \"kaimutya nyaya\", from the words \"kim uta\" meaning \"even more so.\"\n\nIn Islamic jurisprudence, \"a fortiori\" arguments are proved utilising the methods used in \"qiyas\" (reasoning by analogy).\n\nIn logic, a maiore ad minus describes a simple and obvious inference from a claim about a stronger entity, greater quantity, or general class to one about a weaker entity, smaller quantity, or specific member of that class:\n\nThe reverse, less known and less frequently applicable argument is a minore ad maius, which denotes an inference from smaller to bigger.\n\n “Argumentum a maiori ad minus” (from the greater to the smaller) – works in two ways:\n\n\n “Argumentum a minori ad maius” (from the smaller to the greater) – works in the way:\n\n\nAn \"a fortiori\" argument is sometimes considered in terms of analogical reasoning – especially in its legal applications. Reasoning \"a fortiori\" posits not mere that a case regulated by precedential or statutory law and an unregulated case should be treated alike since these cases sufficiently resemble each other, but that the unregulated case deserves to be treated in the same way as the regulated case in a higher degree. The unregulated case is here more similar (analogues) to the regulated case than this case is similar (analogues) to itself.\n\n\n"}

Atiyah defined also formula_1-Betti numbers as von Neumann dimensions of the resulting formula_1-cohomology groups, and computed several examples, which all turned out to be rational numbers. He therefore asked if it is possible for formula_1-Betti numbers to be irrational.\n\nSince then, various researchers asked more refined questions about possible values of formula_1-Betti numbers, all of which are customarily referred to as \"Atiyah conjecture\".\n\nMany positive results were proven by Peter Linnell. For example, if the group acting is a free group, then the formula_1-Betti numbers are integers.\n\nThe most general question open as of late 2011 is whether formula_1-Betti numbers are rational if there is a bound on the orders of finite subgroups of the group which acts. In fact, a precise relationship between possible denominators and the orders in question is conjectured; in the case of torsion-free groups this statement generalizes the zero-divisors conjecture. For a discussion see\nthe article of B. Eckmann.\n\nIn the case there is no such bound, Tim Austin showed in 2009 that formula_1-Betti numbers can assume transcendental values. Later it was shown that in that case they can be any non-negative real numbers.\n"}

{"id": "4070820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4070820", "title": "Card stunt", "text": "Card stunt\n\nCard stunts are a planned, coordinated sequence of actions performed by an audience, whose members raise cards that, in the aggregate, create a recognizable image. The images they create can range widely and, through careful planning, the same cards can create a number of different images by systematically changing how the cards are held up. Although card stunts are now performed at a variety of events ranging from sports to political rallies, the card stunt is closely associated with American football, particularly college football, as well as football (soccer) where it can form part of a tifo. The North Korean mass games Arirang Festival, however, were the first to extend the card stunt to an art form, using flip-book cards to produce enormous hour-long animated sequences.\n\nIn Mexico's Heroic Military Academy, card stunts are done during various occasions, especially on September 13, the anniversary of the Battle of Chapultepec, where a program is made in honor of this great battle.\n\nNorth Korea's yearly Arirang Festival, also known as the Mass Games, in Pyongyang capitalizes on choreography and card stunt to create sweeping images across the stadium. The festival is famed for the use of this technique as part of the iconographic propaganda art of the regime.\n\nCard stunts () are regularly performed in certain sporting events in Thailand. They are especially associated with Jaturamitr Samakkee and Chula–Thammasat Traditional Football Match, but are also employed in most school- and university-level sporting events where performances by the seated crowd often play an important part in the competition. In addition to plain colored cards, other objects such as umbrellas, flashlights and reflective surfaces are also used, and special plates with multiple tiles of colored card booklets are used to create detailed aggregate images.\n\nThe origin of such performances in Thailand can be traced back to Assumption College, a member of the Jaturamitr, where in 1942, by the instruction of Cherd Sudara, a teacher at the school, differently-uniformed students in the audience arranged to form the school's initials. This developed into dynamic messages by physical movement of the crowd and later the covering and exposure of specific-colored clothing. The Chula–Thammasat Traditional Football Match adopted the card stunt in 1957; in the following years, cardboard cards became the predominant medium for the stunts. As a part of larger events, performances by Chulalongkorn University students were featured in the opening ceremony of the 1974 Asian Games at Tehran, and eight thousand students from the Jaturamitr schools performed during the 1999 FESPIC Games in Bangkok.\n\nA 2006 Super Bowl commercial by Budweiser, titled \"The Wave\", features a fictional card stunt using computer animation. The crowd at the Rose Bowl performs a card stunt which shows a beer bottle being opened and poured around the stadium into a glass and subsequently being consumed one gulp at a time. The crowd finished with a collective \"AHHHH\".\n\nIn February, 2006 the Gillette company sponsored the \"World's Largest Card Stunt\" at the NASCAR Daytona 500 with over 118,000 fans set to participate. During the singing of the US National Anthem, fans held up cards forming a patriotic design consisting of stars and stripes. Following the anthem, fans flipped the cards to display the \"Gillette Fusion\" logo. The card stunt was produced by JacobDavis Productions.\n\nThe first card stunt was performed by students at the University of California, Berkeley (\"Cal\") during the 1910 Big Game against rival Stanford University, and consisted of two stunts in total: a picture of the Stanford Axe and a large blue \"C\" on a white background. While the card stunt is closely associated with college football, this first instance took place at a rugby match because all the major colleges and universities on the West Coast of the United States had briefly dropped football in favor of rugby during the early 1910s. As universities switched back, students brought the card stunts with them and by that time they became a national phenomenon associated with college football. While the tradition has subsided at many American colleges and universities, Cal maintains the tradition through the UC Rally Committee. \n\n\"Block I\", the football student cheering section at the University of Illinois, also maintains the tradition by performing a 2000-member, 12-image card stunt during halftime of each home football game.\n\nCard stunts have been the object of several famous college pranks, including the Great Rose Bowl Hoax and the 2004 Harvard-Yale Prank.\n\nAt the opening and closing ceremonies of Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow at the Olympic Stadium (now Luzhniki Stadium), some 6,800 Soviet Army cadets in front of the presidium created many images using this technique. The cadets practiced some six months to perfect their card formations. One of the most memorable was a Misha with a tear dropping, during the closing ceremonies of the event.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum boasted the single, biggest card stunt at the time. 85,000 spectators found colored cards in their seats (which had been preassigned by computer); and at one point the ceremony, just before the various national delegations marched in, all 85,000 spectators flashed their cards to form supposedly all the flags of the nations in attendance. However, there is question today whether 140 flags were indeed flashed because only 87 sections at that time could actually accommodate only 87 flag sections. \n\nA similar stunt was tried at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games opening ceremony as well, which featured 82 nations vs. Los Angeles' supposed 140 images flashed, and 55,000 spectators in Vancouver vs. the 85,000 cards ordered and used in 1984. The stunt at Vancouver was performed in a dimly lit setting (again, as the national delegations started to march in), whereas LA's was performed in broad sunlight.\n\nAt the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, an effect similar to a card stunt was achieved by mounting a small panel with LED lights next to every spectator seat in the stadium, effectively turning the entire seating area into a big display for the audience seated on the opposite side. The show's producers, rather than the audience, controlled the light panels. \n\nCard stunts involving large numbers of people have become a standard part of similar celebratory gatherings in countries such as North Korea.\n\nIn 1958, the science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke published \"A Slight Case of Sunstroke\" (also called \"The Stroke of the Sun\"), a short story in which a diabolical card stunt was used to kill an unpopular soccer referee. In the narrative, a large number of hostile spectators aim reflective program covers at the unfortunate umpire, who is stricken with heat prostration in the resulting solar furnace.\n\n\n"}

Its function in the ancient texts is disputed. It takes the form of the letter nun in mirror image, and appears in the Masoretic text of the Tanakh in nine different places:\n\nThe images at right show three common variants of the inverted nun – vertically flipped, horizontally flipped, and Z-shaped. Other renderings exist, corresponding to alternative interpretations of the term \"inverted\". It may also occur with a dot above.\n\nInverted nuns are found in nine passages of the Masoretic Text of the Bible. The exact shape varies between different manuscripts and printed editions. In many manuscripts, a reversed nun is found—referred to as a \"nun hafucha\" by the Masoretes. In some earlier printed editions, they are shown as the standard nun upside down or rotated, because the printer did not want to bother to design a character to be used only nine times. The recent scholarly editions of the Masoretic text show the reversed nun as described by the Masoretes. In some manuscripts, however, other symbols are occasionally found instead. These are sometimes referred to in rabbinical literature as \"simaniyot\" (markers).\n\nIn the Torah, the inverted nuns frame the text\n\nThe nuns are generally positioned close to, but not touching, the first and last words of the couplet. They are supposed to be positioned between the gaps in between the paragraphs, but there is disagreement as to how this should be done. Some texts invert the existing nuns in the Torah text and don't add inverted nuns before and after it.\n\nRashi's commentary states that the name of the city of Haran at the end of the Torah portion Noach also occurs with an inverted nun, but this is not found in existing texts.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud records in the tractate Shabbath, folio 116a, that the markings surrounding Numbers 10:35–36 were thought to denote that this 85 letter text was not in its proper place. One opinion goes so far as to say that it would appear in another location which discusses the order of tribal column, with the position of the Ark already stated there.\n\nThe 85-letter text found between the nuns is also said to be denoted because it is the model for the least number of letters which constitute a 'text' which one would be required to save from fire due to its holiness. It also suggests that the inverted nuns may suggest the Hebrew word נֵר \"ner\", meaning 'a light'.\nThe tractate Shabbat in the Talmud says regarding the inverted nuns:\n\nSifrei explains these \"signs\":\nThe Talmud continues, stating that as this section is a separate book, the portions of Numbers before and after it also count as books and thus the Torah contains seven books in total:\n\nBar Kappara is known to have considered our Torah as composed of 7 volumes in the Gemara \"The seven pillars with which Wisdom built her house (Prov. 9:1) are the seven Books of Moses\". Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus and Deuteronomy as we know them but Numbers was really 3 separate volumes Num 1:1 to Num 10:35 followed by Number 10:35–36 and the third text from there to the end of Numbers. {quote|R. Shimon Ben Gamliel says: This section will be uprooted from its place and written in its rightful place in the future (but for now it is in its correct location). Why is it written here? So as to separate between first and second retribution [3]. Second retribution is \"and the people grumbled\". First retribution is \"and they traveled from the mountain of G-d (i.e., they eagerly run away from G-d's presence)\". Where is it its appropriate place? Rav Ashi says: \"In the section dealing with the disposition of the Israelites according to their banners and their travelling arrangements\" (Numbers 1:52-2:34, Shabbath 116a).\n\nThe Mishnah, in tractate Yadayim, states:\nAccording to Midrash:\n\nMaharshal ruled that the Talmud only mandates the usual break for a parashah section, and Torah scrolls with extra letters are \"passul\" (unfit for ritual use). Rabbi Yechezkel Landau, however, defends the custom, stating that punctuation such as inverted nuns don't count as extra letters and thus don't invalidate the scroll.\n\nInverted nun appears to have been used as a scribal or editorial annotation or text-critical mark.\n\nThe primary set of inverted nuns is found surrounding the text of Numbers 10:35–36. The Mishna notes that this text is 85 letters long and dotted. This demarcation of this text leads to the later use of the inverted nun markings. Saul Lieberman demonstrated that similar markings can be found in ancient Greek texts where they are also used to denote 'short texts'. Greek sources, especially Alexandrian ones, refer to the sign as reversed sigma.\n\nThe inverted nun is not part of any word, and is never pronounced; thus it is classed as punctuation and not a letter.\n"}

The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The \"n\"-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, -grams may also be called \"shingles\".\n\nUsing Latin numerical prefixes, an \"n\"-gram of size 1 is referred to as a \"unigram\"; size 2 is a \"bigram\" (or, less commonly, a \"digram\"); size 3 is a \"trigram\". English cardinal numbers are sometimes used, e.g., \"four-gram\", \"five-gram\", and so on. In computational biology, a polymer or oligomer of a known size is called a \"k\"-mer instead of an \"n\"-gram, with specific names using Greek numerical prefixes such as \"monomer\", \"dimer\", \"trimer\", \"tetramer\", \"pentamer\", etc., or English cardinal numbers, \"one-mer\", \"two-mer\", \"three-mer\", etc.\n\nAn \"n\"-gram model is a type of probabilistic language model for predicting the next item in such a sequence in the form of a (\"n\" − 1)–order Markov model. \"n\"-gram models are now widely used in probability, communication theory, computational linguistics (for instance, statistical natural language processing), computational biology (for instance, biological sequence analysis), and data compression. Two benefits of \"n\"-gram models (and algorithms that use them) are simplicity and scalability – with larger \"n\", a model can store more context with a well-understood space–time tradeoff, enabling small experiments to scale up efficiently.\n\nFigure 1 shows several example sequences and the corresponding 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram sequences.\n\nHere are further examples; these are word-level 3-grams and 4-grams (and counts of the number of times they appeared) from the Google \"n\"-gram corpus.\n\n3-grams\n\n4-grams\n\nAn \"n\"-gram model models sequences, notably natural languages, using the statistical properties of \"n\"-grams.\n\nThis idea can be traced to an experiment by Claude Shannon's work in information theory. Shannon posed the question: given a sequence of letters (for example, the sequence \"for ex\"), what is the likelihood of the next letter? From training data, one can derive a probability distribution for the next letter given a history of size formula_1: \"a\" = 0.4, \"b\" = 0.00001, \"c\" = 0, ...; where the probabilities of all possible \"next-letters\" sum to 1.0.\n\nMore concisely, an \"n\"-gram model predicts formula_2 based on formula_3. In probability terms, this is formula_4. When used for language modeling, independence assumptions are made so that each word depends only on the last \"n\" − 1 words. This Markov model is used as an approximation of the true underlying language. This assumption is important because it massively simplifies the problem of estimating the language model from data. In addition, because of the open nature of language, it is common to group words unknown to the language model together.\n\nNote that in a simple \"n\"-gram language model, the probability of a word, conditioned on some number of previous words (one word in a bigram model, two words in a trigram model, etc.) can be described as following a categorical distribution (often imprecisely called a \"multinomial distribution\").\n\nIn practice, the probability distributions are smoothed by assigning non-zero probabilities to unseen words or \"n\"-grams; see smoothing techniques.\n\n\"n\"-gram models are widely used in statistical natural language processing. In speech recognition, phonemes and sequences of phonemes are modeled using a \"n\"-gram distribution. For parsing, words are modeled such that each \"n\"-gram is composed of \"n\" words. For language identification, sequences of characters/graphemes (\"e.g.\", letters of the alphabet) are modeled for different languages. For sequences of characters, the 3-grams (sometimes referred to as \"trigrams\") that can be generated from \"good morning\" are \"goo\", \"ood\", \"od \", \"d m\", \" mo\", \"mor\" and so forth, counting the space character as a gram (sometimes the beginning and end of a text are modeled explicitly, adding \"__g\", \"_go\", \"ng_\", and \"g__\"). For sequences of words, the trigrams (shingles) that can be generated from \"the dog smelled like a skunk\" are \"# the dog\", \"the dog smelled\", \"dog smelled like\", \"smelled like a\", \"like a skunk\" and \"a skunk #\".\n\nPractitioners more interested in multiple word terms might preprocess strings to remove spaces. Many simply collapse whitespace to a single space while preserving paragraph marks, because the whitespace is frequently either an element of writing style or introduces layout or presentation not required by the prediction and deduction methodology. Punctuation is also commonly reduced or removed by preprocessing and is frequently used to trigger functionality.\n\n\"n\"-grams can also be used for sequences of words or almost any type of data. For example, they have been used for extracting features for clustering large sets of satellite earth images and for determining what part of the Earth a particular image came from. They have also been very successful as the first pass in genetic sequence search and in the identification of the species from which short sequences of DNA originated.\n\n\"n\"-gram models are often criticized because they lack any explicit representation of long range dependency. This is because the only explicit dependency range is (\"n\" − 1) tokens for an \"n\"-gram model, and since natural languages incorporate many cases of unbounded dependencies (such as wh-movement), this means that an \"n\"-gram model cannot in principle distinguish unbounded dependencies from noise (since long range correlations drop exponentially with distance for any Markov model). For this reason, \"n\"-gram models have not made much impact on linguistic theory, where part of the explicit goal is to model such dependencies.\n\nAnother criticism that has been made is that Markov models of language, including \"n\"-gram models, do not explicitly capture the performance/competence distinction. This is because \"n\"-gram models are not designed to model linguistic knowledge as such, and make no claims to being (even potentially) complete models of linguistic knowledge; instead, they are used in practical applications.\n\nIn practice, \"n\"-gram models have been shown to be extremely effective in modeling language data, which is a core component in modern statistical language applications.\n\nMost modern applications that rely on \"n\"-gram based models, such as machine translation applications, do not rely exclusively on such models; instead, they typically also incorporate Bayesian inference. Modern statistical models are typically made up of two parts, a prior distribution describing the inherent likelihood of a possible result and a likelihood function used to assess the compatibility of a possible result with observed data. When a language model is used, it is used as part of the prior distribution (e.g. to gauge the inherent \"goodness\" of a possible translation), and even then it is often not the only component in this distribution.\n\nHandcrafted features of various sorts are also used, for example variables that represent the position of a word in a sentence or the general topic of discourse. In addition, features based on the structure of the potential result, such as syntactic considerations, are often used. Such features are also used as part of the likelihood function, which makes use of the observed data. Conventional linguistic theory can be incorporated in these features (although in practice, it is rare that features specific to generative or other particular theories of grammar are incorporated, as computational linguists tend to be \"agnostic\" towards individual theories of grammar).\n\nAn issue when using n-gram language models are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. They are encountered in computational linguistics and natural language processing when the input includes words which were not present in a system's dictionary or database during its preparation. By default, when a language model is estimated, the entire observed vocabulary is used. In some cases, it may be necessary to estimate the language model with a specific fixed vocabulary. In such a scenario, the n-grams in the corpus that contain an out-of-vocabulary word are ignored. The n-gram probabilities are smoothed over all the words in the vocabulary even if they were not observed.\n\nNonetheless, it is essential in some cases to explicitly model the probability of out-of-vocabulary words by introducing a special token (e.g. \"<unk>\") into the vocabulary. Out-of-vocabulary words in the corpus are effectively replaced with this special <unk> token before n-grams counts are cumulated. With this option, it is possible to estimate the transition probabilities of n-grams involving out-of-vocabulary words.\n\n\"n\"-grams can also be used for efficient approximate matching. By converting a sequence of items to a set of \"n\"-grams, it can be embedded in a vector space, thus allowing the sequence to be compared to other sequences in an efficient manner. For example, if we convert strings with only letters in the English alphabet into single character 3-grams, we get a formula_5-dimensional space (the first dimension measures the number of occurrences of \"aaa\", the second \"aab\", and so forth for all possible combinations of three letters). Using this representation, we lose information about the string. For example, both the strings \"abc\" and \"bca\" give rise to exactly the same 2-gram \"bc\" (although {\"ab\", \"bc\"} is clearly not the same as {\"bc\", \"ca\"}). However, we know empirically that if two strings of real text have a similar vector representation (as measured by cosine distance) then they are likely to be similar. Other metrics have also been applied to vectors of \"n\"-grams with varying, sometimes better, results. For example, z-scores have been used to compare documents by examining how many standard deviations each \"n\"-gram differs from its mean occurrence in a large collection, or text corpus, of documents (which form the \"background\" vector). In the event of small counts, the g-score (also known as g-test) may give better results for comparing alternative models.\n\nIt is also possible to take a more principled approach to the statistics of \"n\"-grams, modeling similarity as the likelihood that two strings came from the same source directly in terms of a problem in Bayesian inference.\n\n\"n\"-gram-based searching can also be used for plagiarism detection.\n\n\"n\"-grams find use in several areas of computer science, computational linguistics, and applied mathematics.\n\nThey have been used to:\n\nTo choose a value for \"n\" in an \"n\"-gram model, it is necessary to find the right trade off between the stability of the estimate against its appropriateness. This means that trigram (i.e. triplets of words) is a common choice with large training corpora (millions of words), whereas a bigram is often used with smaller ones.\n\nThere are problems of balance weight between \"infrequent grams\" (for example, if a proper name appeared in the training data) and \"frequent grams\". Also, items not seen in the training data will be given a probability of 0.0 without smoothing. For unseen but plausible data from a sample, one can introduce pseudocounts. Pseudocounts are generally motivated on Bayesian grounds.\n\nIn practice it is necessary to \"smooth\" the probability distributions by also assigning non-zero probabilities to unseen words or \"n\"-grams. The reason is that models derived directly from the \"n\"-gram frequency counts have severe problems when confronted with any \"n\"-grams that have not explicitly been seen before – the zero-frequency problem. Various smoothing methods are used, from simple \"add-one\" (Laplace) smoothing (assign a count of 1 to unseen \"n\"-grams; see Rule of succession) to more sophisticated models, such as Good–Turing discounting or back-off models. Some of these methods are equivalent to assigning a prior distribution to the probabilities of the \"n\"-grams and using Bayesian inference to compute the resulting posterior \"n\"-gram probabilities. However, the more sophisticated smoothing models were typically not derived in this fashion, but instead through independent considerations.\n\nIn the field of computational linguistics, in particular language modeling, skip-grams are a generalization of \"n\"-grams in which the components (typically words) need not be consecutive in the text under consideration, but may leave gaps that are \"skipped\" over. They provide one way of overcoming the data sparsity problem found with conventional \"n\"-gram analysis.\n\nFormally, an -gram is a consecutive subsequence of length of some sequence of tokens . A -skip--gram is a length- subsequence where the components occur at distance at most from each other.\n\nFor example, in the input text:\n\nthe set of 1-skip-2-grams includes all the bigrams (2-grams), and in addition the subsequences\n\nSyntactic \"n\"-grams are \"n\"-grams defined by paths in syntactic dependency or constituent trees rather than the linear structure of the text. For example, the sentence \"economic news has little effect on financial markets\" can be transformed to syntactic \"n\"-grams following the tree structure of its dependency relations: news-economic, effect-little, effect-on-markets-financial.\n\nSyntactic \"n\"-grams are intended to reflect syntactic structure more faithfully than linear \"n\"-grams, and have many of the same applications, especially as features in a Vector Space Model. Syntactic \"n\"-grams for certain tasks gives better results than the use of standard \"n\"-grams, for example, for authorship attribution.\n\nAnother type of syntactic \"n\"-grams are part-of-speech \"n\"-grams, defined as fixed-length contiguous overlapping subsequences that are extracted from part-of-speech sequences of text. Part-of-speech \"n\"-grams have several applications, most commonly in information retrieval.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16408577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16408577", "title": "Philippine Spanish", "text": "Philippine Spanish\n\nPhilippine Spanish () is a variant of standard Spanish spoken in the Philippines mostly by Spanish Filipinos. Since the capture and occupation of the Philippines by the United States following the Spanish-American War, the dialect has lost most of its speakers and it might be now close to disappearing.\n\nPhilippine Spanish is a dialect of the Spanish language in the Philippines. The variant is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Latin American emigration to the Spanish East Indies over the years.\n\nFrom 1565 to 1821, the Philippines which were a part of the Spanish East Indies, were governed by the Captaincy General of the Philippines as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain centered in Mexico. It was only administered directly from Spain in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence that same year. Since the Philippines was a former territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for most of the Spanish colonial period, Spanish as was spoken in the Philippines had a greater affinity to American Spanish rather than to Peninsular Spanish.\n\nAn estimated 689,000 people speak Chavacano, a Spanish-based creole. In 2010 the Instituto Cervantes de Manila put the number of Spanish speakers in the Philippines in the area of three million, which included the native and the non-native Chavacano and Spanish speakers as well since there are some Filipinos who can speak Spanish and Chavacano as a second, third, or fourth language.\n\nPhilippine Spanish has the following characteristics. Some of these have been passed on the manner of everyday speech of Filipinos; such as being and seseo.\n\nAs in some dialects in northern Spain and in some bilingual zones (Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru) in Latin America, there is a phonological distinction between the sounds represented by 'll' and 'y' . For example, \" is not pronounced (Tagalog \"). However, yeísmo, which merged the two, occurs in some words like \" (Tagalog \") and \" (Tagalog \").\n\nAs in Latin American Spanish, is not distinguished from . For example, cerveza (Tagalog \"serbesa\").\n\nThe velar jota sound is retracted to glottal , which also occurs in Andalusian, Caribbean, Canarian, and Colombian Spanish: \"Jorge\" .\n\nMalayo-Polynesian countries often interchange and , and , and as well as and ), which also occurs in Philippine Spanish. For example, \"pared\" (Tagalog \"pader\"), Filipinas (Tagalog \"Pilipinas\"), entender (Tagalog \"intindi\") and ojal (Tagalog \"uhal\").\n\nUnlike many Spanish and Latin American dialects, syllable-final \"s\" is always pronounced as an alveolar sibilant , rather than a glottal fricative . For example, \"amores secos\" .\n\nWords like \"hacer\" , \"hablar\" come from the Latin words \"facere\" and \"fabulare,\" respectively. However, in Philippine Spanish, the initial letter is pronounced as ; in other dialects, it is either silent or : and (Tagalog \"habla\"). Because in Philippine Spanish is glottal , it is best to consider such words to be phonemically and , rather than to postulate a marginal phoneme . The same can occur in Andalusian and Caribbean Spanish.\n\nAt the end of a syllable of a word or a word itself, if the syllable/word ends with an l or r, becomes and becomes often. For instance, almíbar (Tagalog \"arnibal), rezar (Tagalog \"dasal\"). This also occurs in Andalusian and Caribbean Spanish.\n\nDiacritic marks are almost always left out except for the tilde on the \"ñ\" because of the use of American machines and the in capability of using such marks by English-language media companies. Typewriters sometimes include the \"ñ\", but they do not include accented vowels. Computer keyboards have always used the US standard layout, which includes neither \"ñ\" nor combining diacritics. Spanish words, however, are vocally stressed the same way as by other Spanish-speakers.\n\nThe following American Spanish words are also used in Philippine Spanish because of the Manila–Acapulco Galleon trade.\n\nWords Present in the RAE Dictionary:\n\nOther Words:\n\nPeninsular Spanish started to influence the vocabulary of Philippine languages after the Philippines was administered directly from Spain. For instance, Philippine Spanish uses \" (potato) instead of \", \" (shrimp) instead of \", \" (you, informal plural) instead of \", \" (peach) instead of \", etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20557129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20557129", "title": "Poster", "text": "Poster\n\nA poster is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to a wall or vertical surface. Typically posters include both textual and graphic elements, although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly text. Posters are designed to be both eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many purposes. They are a frequent tool of advertisers (particularly of events, musicians, and films), propagandists, protestors, and other groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are generally low-cost compared to the original artwork. The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the 1840s and 1850s when the printing industry perfected colour lithography and made mass production possible.\n\nAccording to the French historian Max Gallo, \"for over two hundred years, posters have been displayed in public places all over the world. Visually striking, they have been designed to attract the attention of passers-by, making us aware of a political viewpoint, enticing us to attend specific events, or encouraging us to purchase a particular product or service.\" The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the mid-nineteenth century, when several separate but related changes took place. First, the printing industry perfected colour lithography and made mass production of large and inexpensive images possible. Second, government censorship of public spaces in countries like France was lifted. And finally, advertisers began to market mass-produced consumer goods to a growing populace in urban areas.\n\n\"In little more than a hundred years\", writes poster expert John Barnicoat, \"it has come to be recognized as a vital art form, attracting artists at every level, from painters like Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha to theatrical and commercial designers.\" They have ranged in styles from Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Cubism, and Art Deco to the more formal Bauhaus and the often incoherent hippie posters of the 1960s.\n\nPosters, in the form of placards and posted bills, have been used since earliest times, primarily for advertising and announcements. Purely textual posters have a long history: they advertised the plays of Shakespeare and made citizens aware of government proclamations for centuries. However, the great revolution in posters was the development of printing techniques that allowed for cheap mass production and printing, including notably the technique lithography which was invented in 1796 by the German Alois Senefelder. The invention of lithography was soon followed by chromolithography, which allowed for mass editions of posters illustrated in vibrant colours to be printed.\n\nBy the 1890s, the technique had spread throughout Europe. A number of noted French artists created poster art in this period, foremost amongst them Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Louis Anguetin, Alfred Choubrac, Georges de Feure and Henri-Gabriel Ibels. Chéret is considered to be the \"father\" of advertisement placards. He was a pencil artist and a scene decorator, who founded a small lithography office in Paris in 1866. He used striking characters, contrast and bright colours, and created over 1000 advertisements, primarily for exhibitions, theatres, and products. The industry soon attracted the service of many aspiring painters who needed a source of revenue to support themselves.\n\nChéret developed a new lithographic technique that suited better the needs of advertisers: he added a lot more colour which, in conjunction with innovative typography, rendered the poster much more expressive. Not surprisingly, Chéret is said to have introduced sex in advertising or, at least, to have exploited the feminine image as an advertising ploy. In contrast with those previously painted by Toulouse-Lautrec, Chéret's laughing and provocative feminine figures, often called \"chérettes,\" meant a new conception of art as being of service to advertising.\n\nPosters soon transformed the thoroughfares of Paris, making the streets into what one contemporary called \"the poor man’s picture gallery.\" Their commercial success was such that some fine artists took up poster design in earnest. Some of these artists were, like Alphonse Mucha, in great demand and theatre stars personally selected their own favorite artist to do the poster for an upcoming performance. The popularity of poster art was such that in 1884 a major exhibition was held in Paris.\n\nBy the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. By the end of the 19th century, during an era known as the Belle Époque, the standing of the poster as a serious artform was raised even further. Between 1895 and 1900, Jules Chéret created the Maîtres de l'Affiche (Masters of the Poster) series that became not only a commercial success but is now seen as an important historical publication. Alphonse Mucha and Eugène Grasset were also influential poster designers of this generation, known for their Art Nouveau style and stylized figures, particularly of women. Advertisement posters became a special type of graphic art in the modern age. Poster artists such as Théophile Steinlen, Albert Guillaume, Leonetto Cappiello, Henri Thiriet and others became important figures of their day, their art form transferred to magazines for advertising as well as for social and political commentary.. Indeed, as design historian Elizabeth Guffey notes, “As large, colorful posters began to command the spaces of public streets, markets, and squares, the format itself took on a civic respectability never afforded to Victorian handbills.”\n\nIn the United States, posters underwent a slightly different evolution. By the 1850s, the advent of the traveling circus brought colorful posters to tell citizens that a carnival was coming to town. While many of these posters were beautifully printed, the earliest were mass-produced woodcuts; that technique, as well as their subject matter, crowded style, and bright colors, was often derided by contemporary critics. As chromo-lithography began to reshape European posters, American artists began to take the medium more seriously. Indeed, with work of designers like Edward Penfield, or Will Bradley gained an audience in Europe as well as America.\n\nChallenged by newer modes of advertising, the poster as a communicative form began to decline after the First World War. Civic groups had long assailed the poster, arguing that the form made public spaces ugly. But the real threat to posters came from newer forms of advertising. Mass-market magazines, radio and later television, and bill-boards all cut into advertiser’s marketing budgets. While posters continued to be made and advertised products, they were no longer considered a primary form of advertising. More and more, posters purpose shifted toward political and decorative uses.\n\nIndeed, by the mid 1960s, posters were reborn as part of a broader counter-cultural shift. By 1968 the poster craze was described as \"half way between a passing fashion and a form of mass hysteria.\" \nSometimes called a “second golden age” or \"postermania\" however, this resurgence of popularity saw posters used as decoration and self-expression as much as public protest or advertising.\n\nBy the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. Many posters have had great artistic merit. These include the posters advertising consumer products and entertainment, but also events like the World's Fairs and Colonial Exhibitions.\n\nOther times of great turmoil also produced great posters. The first widespread use of illustrated posters for political ends occurred during the First World War. War bond drives and recruitment posters soon replaced commercial advertisements. German graphic designers, who had pioneered the simple Sachplakat style in the years leading up to the war, applied their talents to the war effort. Artists working for the Allied cause also made over their art in wartime, as well.\n\nThe 1960s saw the rise of pop art and protest movements throughout the West; both made great use of posters and contributed to the poster's revitalization at this time.\nPerhaps the most acclaimed posters were those produced by French students during the so-called \"événements\" of May 1968. During the 1968 Paris student riots and for years to come, Jim Fitzpatrick's stylized poster of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (based on the photo \"Guerrillero Heroico\"), also became a common youthful symbol of rebellion.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, in the United States, public schools across the country posted \"In God We Trust\" framed posters in their \"libraries, cafeterias and classrooms.\" The American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems.\n\nMany printing techniques are used to produce posters. While most posters are mass-produced, posters may also be printed by hand or in limited editions. Most posters are printed on one side and left blank on the back, the better for affixing to a wall or other surface. Pin-up sized posters are usually printed on A3 Standard Silk paper in full colour. Upon purchase, most commercially available posters are often rolled up into a cylindrical tube to allow for damage-free transportation. Rolled-up posters can then be flattened under pressure for several hours to regain their original form.\n\nIt is possible to use poster creation software to print large posters on standard home or office printers.\n\nMany posters, particularly early posters, were used for advertising products. Posters continue to be used for this purpose, with posters advertising films, music (both concerts and recorded albums), comic books, and travel destinations being particularly notable examples.\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, recruiting posters became extremely common, and many of them have persisted in the national consciousness, such as the \"Lord Kitchener Wants You\" posters from the United Kingdom, the \"Uncle Sam wants you\" posters from the United States, or the \"Loose Lips Sink Ships\" posters that warned of foreign spies. Also in Canada, they were widespread.\n\nPosters during wartime were also used for propaganda purposes, persuasion, and motivation, such as the famous Rosie the Riveter posters which exhorted women workers to work in factories during World War II. The Soviet Union also produced a plethora of propaganda posters, some of which became iconic representations of the Great Patriotic War.\nDuring the democratic revolutions of 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe the poster was very important weapon in the hand of the opposition. Brave printed and hand-made political posters appeared on the Berlin Wall, on the statue of St. Wenseslas in Prague and around the unmarked grave of Imre Nagy in Budapest and the role of them was indispensable for the democratic change. An example of an influential political poster is Shepard Fairey's Barack Obama \"HOPE\" poster.\n\nThe film industry quickly discovered that vibrantly coloured posters were an easy way to sell their pictures. Today, posters are produced for most major films, and the collecting of movie posters has become a major hobby. The record price for a poster was set on November 15, 2005 when US$690,000 was paid for a poster of Fritz Lang's 1927 film \"Metropolis\" from the Reel Poster Gallery in London. Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring tremendous prices as well, with an example from The Mummy realizing $452,000 in a 1997 Sotheby's auction, and posters from both The Black Cat and Bride of Frankenstein selling for $334,600 in various Heritage Auctions. The 1931 Frankenstein 6-sheet poster, of which only 1 copy is known to exist, is considered to be the most valuable film poster in the world.\n\nPoster advertising or proposing a travel destination, or simply artistically articulating a place have been made. An example is the Beach Town Posters series, a collection of Art Deco travel posters of American beach resorts that refer to the advertising style of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn the early days of steam railways in Britain, the various rail companies advertised their routes and services on simple printed sheets. By the 1850s, with increasing competition and improvements in printing technology, pictorial designs were being incorporated in their advertising posters. The use of graphic artists began to influence the design of the pictorial poster. In 1905, the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) commissioned Norman Wilkinson to produce artwork for a new landscape poster, advertising their rail/steam packet link to Ireland. In 1908, for the Great Northern Railway (GNR), John Hassall produced the famous image of the \"Jolly Fisherman\" with the \"Skegness is so Bracing\" slogan. The development of this commercial art form throughout the first half of the 20th century reflected the changes in British society, along with the changing styles of art, architecture and fashion as well as changing patterns of holidaymaking.\n\nPosters advertising events have become common. Any sort of public event, from a rally to a play, may be advertised with posters; a few types of events have become notable for their poster advertisements.\n\nBoxing Posters were used in and around the actual venue to advertise the forthcoming fight, date, ticket prices, and usually consisted of pictures of each boxer. Boxing Posters vary in size and vibrancy, but are not usually smaller than 18x22 inches. In the early days, few boxing posters survived the actual event and have thus become a collectible.\n\nMany concerts, particularly rock concerts, have custom-designed posters that are used for advertisement of the event. These often become collectors items as well.\n\nPosters that showcase a person's favorite artist or music group are popular in teenagers' bedrooms, as well as in college dorm rooms and apartments. Many posters have pictures of popular rock bands and artists.\n\nBlacklight posters are designed to have a special effect under a blacklight (ultraviolet light).\n\nPinup posters, \"pinups,\" or cheesecake posters are pictures of attractive women designed to be displayed, first coming to popularity in the 1920s. The popularity of sexy pin-up girl posters has been erratic in recent decades. Pin-ups such as Betty Grable and Jane Russell were highly popular with soldiers during World War II but much less so during the Vietnam War. The late 1970s and into the beginning of the 1980s were boom years for large posters of television actresses, especially Farrah Fawcett and Cheryl Tiegs.\n\nThis refers to decorative posters that are meant to be motivational and inspirational. One popular series has a black background, a scene from nature, and a word such as \"Leadership\" or \"Opportunity.\" Another version (usually framed and matted) uses a two-image hologram which changes as the viewer walks past.\n\nThe resurgence of comic book popularity in the 1960s led to the mass production of comic book posters in the 1970s and onward. These posters typically feature popular characters in a variety of action poses. The fact that comic books are a niche market means that a given poster usually has a smaller printing run than other genres of poster. Therefore, older posters may be quite sought after by collectors. Promotional posters are usually distributed folded, whereas retail posters intended for home decoration are rolled.\n\nPosters are used in academia to promote and explain research work. They are typically shown during conferences, either as a complement to a talk or scientific paper, or as a publication. They are of lesser importance than actual articles, but they can be a good introduction to a new piece of research before the paper is published. They may be considered as grey literature. Poster presentations are often not peer-reviewed, but can instead be submitted, meaning that as many as can fit will be accepted.\n\nPosters are a standard feature of classrooms worldwide.

The speech produced, sometimes called pressured speech, is difficult to interrupt. \n\nSuch speech may be too fast, erratic, irrelevant, or too tangential for the listener to understand. It is an example of cluttered speech, and often associated with certain mental disorders particularly mania and schizophrenia. It can be unrelenting, loud and without pauses.\n\nPressure of speech is a classic hallmark of mania and is often seen during manic periods in patients with bipolar disorder. The pace of the speech indicates an underlying thought disorder known as “Flight of ideas” wherein the flowing of ideas and information through one's mind is so fast that it is difficult to follow their train of thought. This is also tied to an inability to focus on one topic or task.\n\nPeople with schizophrenia, as well as anyone experiencing extreme anxiety, may also exhibit pressure of speech. Pressure of speech usually refers to the improperly verbalized speech which is a feature of hypomanic and manic illness.\n\nPressure of speech has commonly been observed in people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nPsychostimulants such as cocaine or amphetamines may cause speech resembling pressured speech in individuals with pre-existing psychopathology and produce hypomanic or manic symptoms in general, owing both to the substance's own qualities and the underlying nature of an individual's psyche. In many psychotic disorders, use of certain drugs amplifies certain expressions of symptoms, and stimulant-induced pressured speech is among them.\n\n\nPressured speech may also lead to the development of a stutter. The person's need or pressure to speak causes them to involuntarily stutter. Therefore, the person's need to express themselves is greater than their ability to vocalise their thoughts.\n\n\n"}

The RPO was staffed by highly trained Railway Mail Service postal clerks, and was off-limits to the passengers on the train. In the UK and Ireland, the equivalent term was Travelling Post Office (TPO).\n\nFrom the middle of the 19th century, many American railroads earned substantial revenues through contracts with the U.S. Post Office Department (USPOD) to carry mail aboard high-speed passenger trains; and the Railway Mail Service enforced various standardized designs on RPOs. In fact, a number of companies maintained passenger routes where the financial losses from moving people were more than offset by transporting the mail.\n\nThe world's first official carriage of mail by rail was by the United Kingdom's General Post Office in November 1830, using adapted railway carriages on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Sorting of mail en route first occurred in the United Kingdom with the introduction of the Travelling Post Office in 1838 on the Grand Junction Railway following the introduction of the Railways (Conveyance of Mails) Act 1838.\n\nIn the United States, some references suggest that the first shipment of mail carried on a train (sorted at the endpoints and merely carried in a bag on the train with other baggage) occurred in 1831 on the South Carolina Rail Road. Other sources state that the first official contract to regularly carry mail on a train was made with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in either 1834 or 1835. The United States Congress officially designated all railroads as official postal routes on July 7, 1838. Similar services were introduced on Canadian railroads in 1859.\nThe Railway post office was introduced in the United States on July 28, 1862, using converted baggage cars on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad (which also delivered the first letter to the Pony Express). Purpose-built Railway Post Office (RPO) cars entered service on this line a few weeks after the service was initiated. Their purpose was to separate mail for connection with a westbound stagecoach departing soon after the train's arrival at St. Joseph. This service lasted approximately one year. The first permanent Railway Post Office route was established on August 28, 1864, between Chicago, Illinois, and Clinton, Iowa. This service is distinguished from the 1862 operation because mail was sorted to and received from each post office along the route, as well as major post offices beyond the route's end-points.\n\nGeorge B. Armstrong, assistant postmaster at Chicago, originally came up with the idea of having mail processed and distributed while the mail was on board, en route in mail cars. With the assistance of Schuyler Colfax, Speaker of the House at the time, and A. N. Zevely, Third Assistant Postmaster General, he was duly authorized to test his ideas.\n\nIn 1869, the Railway Mail Service (RMS), headed by George B. Armstrong, was officially inaugurated to handle the transportation and sorting of mail aboard trains. Armstrong was promoted from a supervisory position in the Chicago post office following his experiments in 1864 with a converted route agent's car on runs between Chicago and Clinton, Iowa.\n\nRPO car interiors, which at first consisted of solid wood furniture and fixtures, would also soon be redesigned. In 1879, an RMS employee named Charles R. Harrison developed a new set of fixtures that soon gained widespread use. Harrison's design consisted of hinged, cast-iron fixtures that could be unfolded and set up in a number of configurations to hold mail pouches, racks and a sorting table as needed for specific routes. The fixtures were also designed so they could be folded away completely to provide a wholly open space to carry general baggage and express shipments as needed by the railroads. Harrison followed through with manufacturing his design at a factory he opened in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin in 1881.\n\nThe July 1, 1862, Pacific Railroad Act signed by President Lincoln established government funding for the construction of a railroad from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean with the express idea of opening a main line mail route across the western frontier. The act was officially entitled \"AN ACT to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes,\" The Act opened the door to government funded railroad mail routes across the American continent.\n\nBy the 1880s, railway post office routes were operating on the vast majority of passenger trains in the United States. A complex network of interconnected routes allowed mail to be transported and delivered in a remarkably short time. Railway mail clerks were subjected to stringent training and ongoing testing of details regarding their handling of the mail. On a given RPO route, each clerk was expected to know not only the post offices and rail junctions along the route, but also specific local delivery details within each of the larger cities served by the route. Periodic testing demanded both accuracy and speed in sorting mail, and a clerk scoring \"only\" 96% accuracy would likely receive a warning from the Railway Mail Service division superintendent. Interurban and Streetcar systems were also known to operate RPOs. The Boston Elevated Railway car being noted as making circuits of the city to pick up mail.\n\nIn the United States, RPO cars (also known as mail cars or postal cars) were equipped and staffed to handle most back-end postal processing functions. First class mail, magazines and newspapers were all sorted, cancelled when necessary, and dispatched to post offices in towns along the route. Registered mail was also handled, and the foreman in charge was required to carry a regulation pistol while on duty to discourage theft of the mail.\n\n Because of the physical and mental demands placed on RPO clerks, the Railway Mail Service pushed the adoption of standardized floor plans and fixtures for all RPO cars, with the first plans published in 1885. The RMS also pressed for improved lighting fixtures to help the clerks see the addresses on the mail they sorted, first by improving the reflectors in the 1880s, then calling for discontinuance of oil lamps in the 1890s and the first experiments with electric lighting in 1912. Clerks' safety was also of great concern to the RMS, with the first comprehensive statistics on work-related injuries published in 1877.\n\nThrough the second half of the 19th century, most RPO cars were painted in a somewhat uniform color scheme regardless of the railroad that owned or operated them. Most were painted white with trim in either buff, red or blue, which made the cars stand out from the other cars. By the 1890s, this practice had waned as railroads painted their RPO cars to match the rest of their passenger equipment. One RPO car that was displayed at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago is one of the last known examples of the early white color scheme.\n\nAs the development of passenger cars progressed, so too did the development of RPO cars. The first plans for RPO car designs were based on light baggage car frames and bodies, which sometimes resulted in catastrophe for RMS employees when the trains were involved in accidents. From 1900 to 1906 some 70 workers were killed in train wrecks while on duty in the RPOs, leading to demands for stronger steel cars. The RMS developed its first standards for car design in 1891 to address some of these issues. In 1912, the Railway Mail Service developed a set of strength requirements for new cars in an effort to push the car building companies into using steel for the cars' major structural components and underframes. The core of the requirements was that each car should be able to withstand a buffer force of at least 400,000 pounds. This requirement was doubled to 800,000 pounds in a 1938 revision of the standards. The requirements were again strengthened in 1945 with specifications that precluded the use of aluminium for framing and major structural components. The 1945 revisions also included a requirement for end posts to prevent telescoping in the event of a collision. Car manufacturers adopted these requirements and carried them through to all other models of passenger cars that they built. The 800,000 lb buffer load and end post requirements were later adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for all passenger MU locomotives as of April 1, 1956 and to all passenger cars and locomotives in 1999 by the USDOT.\nAn interesting feature of most RPO cars was a hook that could be used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a track-side mail crane at smaller towns where the train did not stop. The first US patent for such a device () was awarded to L.F. Ward of Elyria, Ohio, on January 29, 1867. With the train often operating at 70 mph or more, a postal clerk would have a pouch of mail ready to be dispatched as the train passed the station. In a co-ordinated movement, the catcher arm was swung out to catch the hanging mail pouch while the clerk stood in the open doorway. As the inbound pouch slammed into the catcher arm, the clerk kicked the outbound mail pouch out of the car, making certain to kick it far enough that it was not sucked back under the train. An employee of the local post office would retrieve the pouch and deliver it to the post office.\n\nIn the 1950s the Budd Company offered two versions of its self-propelled diesel RDC with RPO: the RDC-3 combine and the RDC-4 (a baggage/mail/express only unit). These models were purchased by the New York Central, Boston & Maine, New Haven Railroad, Rock Island, Pacific Great Eastern, Northern Pacific, Canadian Pacific Railway, Canadian National and Minneapolis & St. Louis.\n\nMost RPO cars had a mail slot on the side of the car, so that mail could actually be deposited in the car, much like using the corner mail box, while the train was stopped at a station. Those desiring the fastest delivery would bring their letters to the train station for dispatch on the RPO, knowing that overnight delivery would be virtually assured. The mail handled in this manner received a cancellation just as if it had been mailed at a local post office, with the cancel giving the train number, endpoint cities of the RPO route, the date, and RMS Railway Mail Service or PTS Postal Transportation Service between the killer bars. Collecting such cancellations is a pastime of many philatelists and postal history researchers.\n\nThe Railway Mail Service organization within the Post Office Department existed between 1864 and September 30, 1948. It was renamed the Postal Transportation Service on October 1, 1948, and existed until 1960. After 1960, the management of railway post office routes as well as Highway Post Office routes, Air Mail Facility, Terminal Railway Post Office, and Transfer Office, were shifted to the Bureau of Transportation.\n\nAt their height, RPO cars were used on over 9,000 train routes covering more than 200,000 route miles in North America. While the majority of this service consisted of one or more cars at the head end of passenger trains, many railways operated solid mail trains between major cities; these solid mail trains would often carry 300 tons of mail daily.\nAfter 1948, the railway post office network began its decline although it remained the principal intercity mail transportation and distribution function within the Post Office Department (POD). There were 794 RPO lines operating over 161,000 miles of railroad in that year. Only 262 RPO routes were still operating by January 1, 1962. In 1942, the POD began experimenting with a highway version of the RPO to serve the same purposes along routes where passenger train service was not available. These highway post office (HPO) vehicles were initially intended to supplement RPO service, but in the 1950s and 1960s, HPOs often replaced railway post office cars after passenger train service was discontinued. The last interurban RPO service was operated by Pacific Electric Railway on its route between Los Angeles and San Bernardino, California. When the post office made a controversial policy change to process mail in large regional \"sectional centers,\" mail was now sorted by large machines, not by people, and the remaining railway post office routes, along with all highway post office routes, were phased out of service. In September 1967 the POD cancelled all \"mail by rail\" contracts, electing to move all First Class mail via air and other classes by road (truck) transport. This announcement had a devastating effect on passenger train revenues; the Santa Fe, for example, lost $35 million (US) in annual business, and led directly to the ending of many passenger rail routes.\n\nAfter 113 years of railway post office operation, the last surviving railway post office running on rails between New York and Washington, D.C. was discontinued on June 30, 1977. The last route with a railway post office title was actually a boat run that lasted a year longer. This Boat Railway Post Office was the Lake Winnipesaukee RPO operating between The Weirs, New Hampshire, and Bear Island on Lake Winnipesaukee. The final date it operated with a postmark was September 30, 1978.\n\nMany RPO cars have been preserved in railroad museums across North America; some of the cars are kept in operational condition. In 1933, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad rebuilt one of its baggage cars into a replica of the first RPOs that were used on the Hannibal and St. Joseph in 1862. The railroad displayed the car in several cities along the railroad; it now resides at the Patee House Museum in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nThe Minnesota Transportation Museum (MTM) maintains Northern Pacific #1102, a 1914 Mail RPO, that is classed as a \"combine\" car, having sections for the RPO, Railway Express Agency and twenty seats for paying passengers. Currently, it is the only Railway Post Office car known to be operational and currently certified for operation on commercial rail. The Osceola & St Croix Valley Railway (division of MTM/reporting mark MNTX) operates the car as part of its tour line, actually \"catching the mail on the fly\" as a part of its regular runs.\n\nAs part of the 40th anniversary of the end of RPO service, Minnesota Transportation Museum will be placing #1102 on display at Saint Paul Union Depot as part of its \"Last Mail Train\" for National Train Day, 6 May 2017. At the end of the day, Great Northern 400, Northern Pacific RPO #1102 and two coaches will be departing Union Depot as Train #1 bound for Osceola, Wisconsin. It will be hauling commemorative envelopes and cards to be sent all across the United States, following which it will operate in regular service as part of the Museum operations out of Osceola, WI.\n\nSteamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, PA has RPO car #1100, Louisville & Nashville, on display. It is an all-steel car built in 1914 by the American Car and Foundry Company.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22351741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22351741", "title": "Regulatory focus theory", "text": "Regulatory focus theory\n\nRegulatory focus theory (RFT) is a goal pursuit theory formulated by Columbia University psychology professor and researcher E. Tory Higgins regarding people's perceptions in the decision making process. RFT examines the relationship between the motivation of a person and the way in which they go about achieving their goal. RFT posits two separate and independent self-regulatory orientations: prevention and promotion (Higgins, 1997).\n\nThis psychological theory, like many others, is applied in communication, specifically in the subfields of nonverbal communication and persuasion.Chronic regulatory focus is measured using the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (Higgins et al., 2001) or the Regulatory Strength measure. Momentary regulatory focus can be primed or induced.\n\nTo understand RFT, it is important to understand another of E. Tory Higgins' theories: regulatory fit theory. When a person believes that there is \"fit\", they will involve themselves more in what they are doing and \"feel right\" about it. Regulatory fit should not directly affect the hedonic occurrence of a thing or occasion, but should influence a person's assurance in their reaction to the object or event.\n\nRegulatory fit theory suggests that a match between orientation to a goal and the means used to approach that goal produces a state of regulatory fit that both creates a feeling of rightness about the goal pursuit and increases task engagement (Higgins, 2001, 2005). Regulatory fit intensifies responses, such as the value of a chosen object, persuasion, and job satisfaction.\n\nRegulatory fit does not increase the assessment of a decision; instead when someone feels \"right\" about their decision, the experience of \"correctness and importance\" is transferred to the ensuing assessment of the chosen object, increasing its superficial worth. Research suggests that the \"feeling right\" experience can then sway retrospective or prospective evaluations. Regulatory fit can be manipulated incidentally (outside the context of interest) or integrally (within the context of interest).\n\nRFT refers to when a person pursues a goal in a way that maintains the person's own personal values and beliefs, also known as \"regulatory orientation\". This theory operates on the basic principle that people embrace pleasure but avoid pain, and they then maintain their regulatory fit based on this standard.\n\nThe \"regulatory focus\" is basically the way in which someone approaches pleasure but avoids pain. An individual's regulatory focus concentrates on desired end-states, and the approach motivation used to go from the current state to the desired end-state. This theory differentiates between a \"promotion-focus\" on hopes and accomplishments, also known as gains. This focus is more concerned with higher level gains such as advancement and accomplishment.\n\nAnother focus is the \"prevention-focus\" based on safety and responsibilities, also known as non-losses. This focus emphasizes security and safety by following the guidelines and the rules.\n\nThese two regulatory focuses regulate the influences that a person would be exposed to in the decision-making process, and determine the different ways they achieve their goal, as discussed by RFT. An individual's regulatory orientation is not necessarily fixed. While individuals have chronic tendencies towards either promotion or prevention, these preferences may not hold for all situations. Furthermore, a specific regulatory focus can be induced.\n\nThe value taken from interaction and goal attainment can be either positive or negative. The decision has positive value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that fits their regulatory orientation and it will have negative value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that does not fit their regulatory orientation. Regulatory fit allows value to be created by intensifying the commitment, based on one of the regulatory focus orientations. Making choices and fulfilling objectives are considered as activities, and with any activity, people can be more or less involved. When this involvement is strong, it can intensify the feelings and values about this activity, and the approach to the activity determines whether they are or are not satisfied with the outcome and method of achieving the outcome.\n\nThis theory has noteworthy implications for increasing the value of life. For example, in interpersonal conflict, if each person experiences \"fit\", each one will be satisfied with and committed to the outcome. In the broad sense, for people to appreciate their own lives, they need to be satisfied and \"feel right\" about what they are doing, and the way they are doing it. If it is not satisfying, it is known as \"non-fit\", and they will not reach their desired goal.\n\nRegulatory focus theory, according to Higgins, views motivation in a way that allows an understanding of the foundational ways we approach a task or a goal. Different factors can motivate people during goal pursuit, and we self-regulate our methods and processes during our goal pursuit. RFT proposes that motivational strength is enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains their regulatory orientation. Achieving a goal in a way that is consistent to a person's regulatory orientation leads to an individual sense of importance to the event. The impact of motivation is considered calculated and this creates a greater sense of commitment to the goal. The more strongly an individual is engaged (i.e., involved, occupied, fully engrossed) in an activity, the more intense the motivational force experienced. Engagement is of great importance to attain and motivate in order to reach a goal. Engagement serves as intensifier of the directional component of the value experience. An individual who is strongly engaged in a goal pursuits will experience a positive target more positively and a negative target more negatively.\n\nIndividuals can pursue different goals with diverse regulatory orientations and in unlike ways. There are two different kinds of regulatory orientations that people use to obtain their goals: \"promotion-focus orientation\" and \"prevention-focus orientation\". These terms are derived from E. Tory Higgins's Theory of Regulatory Focus. In which, he adds to the notion that people regulate their goal-oriented behavior in two very distinct ways, coined \"promotion-focus orientation\" and \"prevention-focus orientation\"\n\nE. Tory Higgins uses this example: there is Student A and Student B, and they both have the shared goal to make an \"A\" in a class they are both taking in college. Student A uses a \"promotion-focus orientation\" which slants them towards achieving their goal and towards advancement, growth and life accomplishment. This would cause Student A to view the goal as an ideal that satisfies their need for accomplishment. Student B uses a \"prevention-focus orientation\" where the goal is something that should be realized because it fulfills their need for security, protection and prevention of negative outcomes. Student A uses an eager approach where they read extra materials to obtain their goal of an \"A\". Student B uses a vigilant approach where they become more detail oriented and pay careful attention to completing all of the course requirements.\n\nBoth forms of regulatory orientation can work to fulfill goals, but the choice of orientation is based on individual preferences and style. When a person pursues their goal in the focus that fits their regulatory orientation, they are more likely to pursue their goal more eagerly and aggressively than if they were using the other focus.In this case each student has different styles. They both feel more comfortable in persuading their goal. The outcome in this experiment would have been different if the students were given an undesirable choice.\n\nWhen people make decisions, they often envision the possible \"pleasure or pain\" of the possible outcomes that the focus orientation will produce. A person imagining making a pleasing choice is more likely to engage in promotion-focus orientation because envisioning the possible outcome of success maintains eagerness about the outcome but does not place importance on vigilance. A person imagining the possible pain by making an undesirable choice maintains more vigilance but less eagerness.\n\nA person with promotion-focus orientation is more likely to remember the occasions where the goal is pursued by using eagerness approaches and less likely to remember occasions where the goal is pursued by vigilance approaches. A person with prevention-focus orientation is more likely to remember events where the goal is pursued by means of vigilance than if it was pursued using eagerness approaches.\n\nWhen relating regulatory focus theory to persuasion, it is important to remember that RFT is a goal-attainment theory, and that RFT can spawn feelings of rightness/wrongness which in turn may produce formulations for judgments.\n\nThe feelings of rightness give an individual more commitment to the information coming in and therefore can avoid endangering their regulatory fit which in turn changes their regulatory focus and accepting a probable motive to change. If a person experiences feelings of wrongness they will suffer negative emotions and deem the experience \nand information as a threat to their regulatory fit and therefore a threat to their regulatory focus and their goal.\n\nStudies have been done where fit and focus have been applied to show their applicability to consumer purchasing, health advisories, and social policy issues. To be persuaded is to change your prior feelings, actions, and/or beliefs on a matter to where you agree with the persuader.\n\nThe \"fit\" involved in RFT plays a large role in such issues and stories because it can be a device to help an individual receive and review the experience during a particular message delivery. Positive reinforcement and feelings of rightness while decoding the message creates a stronger engagement and relationship with processing the message, and negative reinforcement and feelings of wrongness lessens the engagement and attachment.\n\nResearchers found that targeting the two different regulatory focus orientations, and their coinciding types of fit, works as an effective process to aid in persuasive charm or pull when they introduced a manner of persuasion where the framing of the message was everything and the content was irrelevant to uphold or interrupt a person's regulatory fit and follow the pattern of logic used in regulatory orientation.\n\nLee and Aaker (2004) conducted an experiment that involved whether or not to give their information in a prevention-focus- or promotion-focus-concerning way. The study involved an advertisement for a grape juice drink, which they split into two to create prevention-focus concerns (disease-preventing) and then promotion-focus concerns (energy enhancement). In doing so, they demonstrated that rather than trying to know each individual recipient's qualities, one needs only to start by nailing the focus (prevention/promotion) and then framing the message so that it creates that \"rightness\".\n\nSome may confuse RFT with regulatory fit, regulatory relevance, message matching, and source attractiveness in such an example. The extent of similarities between closely related theories of RFT, such as ones stated above, make it hard to clarify when this theory is applicable or apparent in respect to the persuasion process.\n\nRFT can be a useful outline for a better understanding of the effects of nonverbal cues in persuasion and impression formation. Regulatory Fit Theory suggests that the effect of a cue cannot be understood without remembering what the cue means given a recipient's focus orientation.\n\nNonverbal cues can be used by the message source to vary delivery style, more specifically to convey eagerness or vigilance, of a given message in a way that will produce regulatory fit in message recipients of different focus orientations.\n\nAdvancement implies eager movement forward, so eagerness is conveyed by gestures that involve animated, broad opening movements such as hand movements projecting outward, forward leaning body positions, fast body movement, and fast speech rate. Caution implies vigilant carefulness, so vigilance should be conveyed by gestures that show precision like slightly backward-leaning body positions, slower body movement, and slower speech rate.\n\nAn eager nonverbal delivery style will result in greater message effectiveness for promotion-focus recipients than for prevention-focus recipients, while the opposite is true for a vigilant nonverbal style.\n\nThere are various aspects, which may contribute to whether or not a message's persuasive element is successful. One aspect is the effect of nonverbal cues and their association with persuasive appeals based on the message recipient's motivational regulatory orientation. This determines the recipient's impression of the source during impression formation.\n\nResearch has found that nonverbal cues are an essential element of most persuasive appeals. RFT creates the background that allows a prediction for when and for whom a nonverbal cue can have an effect on persuasion. When nonverbal cues and signals are used appropriately, they increase the effectiveness of persuasion.\n\n\n"}

He was captured by Genghis Khan in the 13th century and soon taught the Old Uyghur alphabet to members of the court and adapted it, to match the Mongol Khalkha language, although Genghis (or Chingis) himself never learned it.\n\nThe Uyghur script was used in Mongolia until its independence from Qing dynasty China, at the beginning of the 20th century and few years before Russia introduced Cyrillic. It is still used mainly in Inner-Mongolia. In current day Mongolia, Cyrillic is the official script for the Mongolian language, and the traditional script is referred to as the \"Old Mongol script\" (). Today, an estimated 6 million Mongolians from China can still read the traditional Mongolian script but only 3 million from Mongolia.\n\nThe Manchu alphabet was derived since the very end of the 16th century from this Mongolian script.\n\n"}

To save money, people typically wrote their telegrams in a very compressed style, without conjunctions or articles. As children develop language, they speak similarly: when a child says \"Daddy here\", it is understood that the child means \"Daddy is here\", omitting the copula. The words dropped in this style of speech are closed class or function words.\n\nIn the field of psychology, telegraphic speech is defined as a form of communication consisting of simple two-word long sentences often composed of a noun and a verb that adhere to the grammatical standards of the culture's language. For example, an English-speaking child would say \"Give cupcake\" to express that they would like a cupcake rather than \"Cupcake give\", as a Turkish- or Japanese-speaking child would. Researchers have noted that this period of language acquisition occurs some time between the ages of 18–36 months and is present not just in English-speaking cultures, but can be found worldwide.\n\nIn adults, regression to telegraphic speech may indicate a neurological problem such as multiple sclerosis. Telegraphic speech is also common in non-fluent aphasia (Broca's aphasia), which is caused by a stroke damaging the posterior-inferior frontal lobe. It is also a potential symptom of schizophrenia, as a manifestation of manneristic speech.\n\n"}

{"id": "1243531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1243531", "title": "Turoyo language", "text": "Turoyo language\n\nTuroyo (also called Surayt) is a Central Neo-Aramaic language traditionally spoken in Southeastern Turkey and Northeastern Syria by Syriac Christians. Most speakers use the Classical Syriac language for literature and worship.\n\nTuroyo speakers are currently mostly members of the Syriac Orthodox Church, but there are also Turoyo-speaking members of the Chaldean Catholic Church, especially from the town of Midyat, and of the Assyrian Church of the East. It is also currently spoken in the Syriac Diaspora, although classified as a vulnerable language.\n\nTuroyo is not mutually intelligible with Western Neo-Aramaic having been separated for over a thousand years, while mutual intelligibility with Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Chaldean Neo-Aramaic is limited.\n\nContrary to what these language names suggest, they are not specific to a particular church, with members of the Assyrian Church of the East and Chaldean Catholic Church speaking Turoyo, and members of the Syriac Orthodox Church speaking Assyrian or Chaldean Neo-Aramaic dialects.\n\nFrom the word ', meaning 'mountain', is the mountain tongue of the Tur Abdin in southeastern Turkey. Another name for the language is ', and it is used by a number of speakers of the language, as well as the recent EU funded programme to revitalize the language in preference to \"\", since Surayt is a historical name for the language used by Assyrians while Turoyo is an academic name for the language used to distinguish it from other Neo-Aramaic languages and Classical Syriac. However, especially in the diaspora, the language is frequently called \"Surayt/Suryoyo/Suroyo\" (or \"Sureyt\", \"Sŭryoyo\" or \"Süryoyo\" depending on dialect), meaning \"Syriac\". Turoyo is sometimes also referred to as \"Western Syriac\" or \"Western Assyrian\".\n\nTuroyo has evolved from the Eastern Aramaic colloquial varieties that have been spoken in Tur Abdin and the surrounding plain for more than a thousand years since the initial introduction of Aramaic to the region. However, it has also been influenced by Classical Syriac, which itself was the variety of the Eastern Middle Aramaic spoken farther west, in the city of Edessa. Due to the proximity of Tur Abdin to Edessa, and the closeness of their parent languages, meant that Turoyo bears a greater similarity to Classical Syriac than do Northeastern Neo-Aramaic varieties.\n\nThe homeland of Turoyo is the Tur Abdin region in southeastern Turkey. This region is a traditional stronghold of Syriac Orthodox Christians. The Turoyo-speaking population prior to the Assyrian genocide largely adhered to the Syriac Orthodox Church. In 1970 it was estimated that there were 20,000 Turoyo-speakers still living in the area, however, they gradually migrated to Western Europe and elsewhere in the world. The Turoyo-speaking diaspora is now estimated at 40,000. In the diaspora communities, Turoyo is usually a second language which is supplemented by more mainstream languages. The language is considered endangered by UNESCO, but efforts are still made by Turoyo-speaking communities to sustain the language through use in homelife, school programs to teach Turoyo on the weekends, and summer day camps. Today only hundreds of speakers remain in Tur Abdin.\n\nUntil recently, Turoyo was a spoken vernacular and was never written down: Kthobhonoyo was the written language. In the 1880s, various attempts were made, with the encouragement of western missionaries, to write Turoyo in the Syriac alphabet, in the \"Serto\" and in \"Estrangelo\" script used for West-Syriac Kthobhonoyo.\n\nHowever, with upheaval in their homeland through the twentieth century, many Turoyo speakers have emigrated around the world (particularly to Syria, the Lebanon, Sweden and Germany). The Swedish government's education policy, that every child be educated in his or her first tongue, led to the commissioning of teaching materials in Turoyo. Yusuf Ishaq thus developed an alphabet for Turoyo/Surayt based on the Latin script. Silas Üzel also created a separate Latin alphabet for Turoyo in Germany.\n\nA series of reading books and workbooks that introduce Ishaq's alphabet are called \"Toxu Qorena!\", or \"Come Let's Read!\" This project has also produced a Swedish-Turoyo dictionary of 4500 entries: the \"Svensk-turabdinskt Lexikon: Leksiqon Swedoyo-Suryoyo\". Another old teacher, writer and translator of Turoyo is Yuhanun Üzel (born in Midun in 1934) who in 2009 finished the translation of the Peshitta Bible in Turoyo, with Benjamin Bar Shabo and Yahkup Bilgic, in Serto (West-Syriac) and Latin script, a foundation for the \"Aramean-Syriac language\".\n\nTuroyo has borrowed some words from Arabic, Kurdish, Armenian, and Turkish. The main dialect of Turoyo is that of Midyat (Mëḏyoyo), in the east of Turkey's Mardin Province. Every village have distinctive dialects (Midwoyo, Kfarzoyo, `Iwarnoyo, Nihloyo and Izloyo, respectively). All Turoyo dialects are mutually intelligible with each other. There is a dialectal split between the town of Midyat and the villages, with only slight differences between the individual villages. A closely related language or dialect, Mlaḥsô, spoken in two villages in Diyarbakir, is now deemed extinct.\n\nMany Turoyo-speakers who have left their villages now speak a mixed dialect of their village dialect with the Midyat dialect. This mixture of dialects was used by Ishaq as the basis of his system of written Turoyo. For example, Ishaq's reading book uses the word \"qorena\" in its title instead of the Mëḏyoyo \"qurena\" or the village-dialect \"qorina\". All speakers are bilingual in another local language. Church schools in Syria and the Lebanon teach Kthobonoyo rather than Turoyo, and encourage the replacement of non-Syriac loanwords with authentic Syriac ones. Some church leaders have tried to discourage the use and writing of Turoyo, seeing it as an impure form of Syriac.\n\nSurayt is written both in Latin and Syriac (Serto) characters. The orthography provided below for Turoyo/Surayt was the outcome of the International Surayt Conference held at the University of Cambridge (27-30 August 2015).\n\nAttempts to write down Turoyo have begun since the 16th century, with Jewish Neo-Aramaic adaptions and translations of Biblical texts, commentaries, as well as hagiographic stories, books, and folktales in Christian dialects. The Nestorian Bishop Mar Yohannan working with American missionary Rev. Justin Perkins also tried to write the vernacular version of religious texts, culminating in the production of school-cards in 1836.\n\nIn 1970s Germany, members of the Syriac evangelical movement (Aramäische freie Christengemeinde in German) used Turoyo to write short texts and songs. The Syriac evangelical movement has also published over 300 Turoyo hymns in a compedium named \"Kole Ruhonoye\" in 2012, as well as translating the four gospels with Mark and John being published so far.\n\nThe alphabet as used in a forthcoming translation of \"New Peshitta in Turoyo\" by Yuhanun Bar Shabo, \"Sfar mele surtoṯoyo - Picture dictionary\" and Benjamin Bar Shabo's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\n\nIn the 1970s, educator Yusuf Ishaq attempted to systematically incorporate the Turoyo language into a Latin orthography, which resulted in a series of reading books, entitled [toxu qorena]. Although this system is not used outside of Sweden, other Turoyo speakers have developed their own non-standardized Latin script to use the language on digital platforms.\n\nThe Swedish government's \"mother-tongue education\" project treated Turoyo as an immigrant language, like Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, and began to teach the language in schools. The staff of the National Swedish Institute for Teaching Material produced a Latin letter-based alphabet, grammar, dictionary, school books, and instructional material. Due to religious and political objections, the project was halted.\n\nThere are other efforts to translate famous works of literature, including The Aramaic Students Association's translation of \"The Little Prince\", the Nisbin Foundation's translation of \"Cinderella\" and \"Little Red Riding Hood.\"\n\nPhonetically, Turoyo is very similar to Classical Syriac. The additional phonemes (as in judge\"), (as in church\") (as in \"azure\") and a few instances of (the Arabic ẓāʾ) mostly only appear in loanwords from other languages.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Turoyo phonology is its use of reduced vowels in closed syllables. The phonetic value of such reduced vowels differs depending both on the value of original vowel and the dialect spoken. The Miḏyoyo dialect also reduces vowels in pre-stress open syllables. That has the effect of producing a syllabic schwa in most dialects (in Classical Syriac, the schwa is not syllabic).\n\nTuroyo has the following set of vowels:\n\nThe verbal system of Turoyo is similar to that used in other Neo-Aramaic languages. In Classical Syriac, the ancient perfect and imperfect tenses had started to become preterite and future tenses respectively, and other tenses were formed by using the participles with pronominal clitics or shortened forms of the verb \"hwā\" ('to become'). Most modern Aramaic languages have completely abandoned the old tenses and form all tenses from stems based around the old participles. The classical clitics have become incorporated fully into the verb form, and can be considered more like inflections.\n\nTuroyo has also developed the use of the demonstrative pronouns much more than any other Aramaic language. In Turoyo/Surayt, they have become definite articles:\n\nThe Modern Western Syriac dialect of Mlahsô and Ansha villages in Diyarbakır Province is quite different from Turoyo. It is virtually extinct; its last few speakers live in Qamishli in northeastern Syria and in the diaspora. Turoyo/Surayt is also more closely related to other Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects than the Western Neo-Aramaic dialect of Maaloula.\n\nTuroyo has three sets of particles that take the place of the copula in nominal clauses: enclitic copula, independent copula, and emphatic independent copula. In Turoyo, the non-enclitic copula (or the existential particle) is articulated with the use of two sets of particles: \"kal\" and \"kit\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "473324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=473324", "title": "Uses and gratifications theory", "text": "Uses and gratifications theory\n\nUses and gratifications theory (UGT) is an approach to understanding why and how people actively seek out specific media to satisfy specific needs. UGT is an audience-centered approach to understanding mass communication. Diverging from other media effect theories that question \"what does media do to people?\", UGT focuses on \"what do people do with media?\"\nIt postulates that media is a highly available product and the audiences are the consumers of the same product\n\nThis communication theory is positivistic in its approach, based in the socio-psychological communication tradition, and focuses on communication at the mass media scale. The driving question of UGT is: \"Why\" do people use media and what do they use them for? UGT discusses how users deliberately choose media that will satisfy given needs and allow one to enhance knowledge, relaxation, social interactions/companionship, diversion, or escape.\n\nIt assumes that audience members are not passive consumers of media. Rather, the audience has power over their media consumption and assumes an active role in interpreting and integrating media into their own lives. Unlike other theoretical perspectives, UGT holds that audiences are responsible for choosing media to meet their desires and needs to achieve gratification. This theory would then imply that the media compete against other information sources for viewers' gratification.\n\nUGT has a heuristic value today because it gives communication scholars a \"perspective through which a number of ideas and theories about media choice, consumption, and even impact can be viewed\".\n\nMark Levy and Sven Windahl provide a good description of what it means to be an \"active consumer\" of media:\n\nUnlike other theories concerning media consumption, UGT gives the consumer power to discern what media they consume, with the assumption that the consumer has a clear intent and use. This contradicts previous theories such as mass society theory, that states that people are helpless victims of mass media produced by large companies; and individual differences perspective, which states that intelligence and self-esteem largely drive an individual's media choice.\n\nGiven these differing theories, UGT is unique in its assumptions:\n\nKatz, Blumler, and Gurevitch synthesized that UGT's approach was focused on \"the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources, which lead to differential patterns of media exposure (or engagement in other activities), resulting in need gratifications and some other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones.\"\n\nAccording to Katz, Blumler and Gurevitch's research there were five components comprising the Uses and Gratifications Approach. The components are:\n\nAccording to the research, goals for media use can be grouped into five uses. The audience wants to:\n\nGS and GO is one of the research issues dealing with U&G theory, and it is a contrast between \"what you were seeking from experience\" versus \"what you actually got from the experience - whether it was a satisfying experience or not.\"\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, researchers began seeing patterns under the perspective of the uses and gratifications theory in radio listeners. Early research was concerned with topics such as children's use of comics and the absence of newspapers during a newspaper strike. An interest in more psychological interpretations emerged during this time period. \n\nIn 1948, Lasswell introduced a four-functional interpretation of the media on a macro-sociological level. Media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society and individuals\n\nUses and gratifications theory was developed from a number of prior communication theories and research conducted by fellow theorists.\n\n\n\n\nMobile phones, a comparatively new technology, have many uses and gratifications attached to them. Due to their nature of mobility, constant access, and options to both add and access content, this field is expanding with new research on the motivations behind using mobile phones.\n\nIn general, people use mobile phones for the following uses and gratifications\n\nUses and gratifications do, however, differ based on location and audience:\n\nThe specific function of text messaging has been studied to find its uses and gratifications and explore any potential gender differences. The researchers proposed seven uses and gratifications; they are listed below, from highest to lowest ranked according to the study's results:\n\nThe results also displayed gender differences (in an undergraduate population): women scored the UG of accessibility/mobility, relaxation and escape, and coordination higher than the men did. These results may imply social and societal expectations for females around independence but connected to family and friends and/or a tendency for women to rely more on detailed conversation in text messaging than men.\n\nSince many now use their mobile phones as devices to connect to the internet and both contribute and retrieve content, researchers have investigated the UG of smart devices which engage multiple media. The uses and gratifications for contributing mobile content differ from those for retrieving mobile content. \n\nThe Internet provides a new and deep field for exploring UGT. It was found to have three main categories of gratifications: content gratification, process gratification, and social gratification.\n\nScholars like LaRose et al. utilize UGT to understand Internet usage via a socio-cognitive framework to reduce uncertainties that arise from homogenizing an Internet audience and explaining media usage in terms of only positive outcomes (gratifications). LaRose et al. created measures for self-efficacy and self-disparagement and related UGT to negative outcomes of online behavior (like Internet addiction) as well.\n\nRecent research has looked at social networking services, personal and subject-based blogs, and internet forums put together to study the U&G in posting social content, the relationship between gratifications and narcissism, and the effects of age on this relationship and these gratifications. Users have motivations of the following overall:\n\nForums were found to be the main media for venting negative feelings, potentially due to the fact that comparatively, forums are more of a one-way street. Use of social media cures loneliness and satisfies a compulsion for addictive behaviors. Similar to the variables of gender, location, and audience as previous research has found, the U&G differed by category of narcissism. The researchers found four multi-dimensional narcissistic personality types: feeling authoritative or superior, exhibitionistic, exploitative, and often hungry for vanity. The U&G differed depending on the specific type of narcissism a given user had. For instance, those who were exhibitionistic tended to focus on the social media U&G of showing affection, expressing negative feelings, and being recognized. Those who viewed themselves as superior had higher uses and gratifications by cognitive motivations than by recognition. The vain narcissists were most gratified by recognition and attention, and they did not vent negative feelings. Exhibitionists were motivated by all gratifications of social media. No generational differences were found in the narcissistic tendencies.\n\nBasic research finds that socialization motivates use of friend-networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook. Particulars under socialization might be finding old friends, making new friends, learning about events, creating social functions, and feeling connected. Some further exploration has demonstrated that although emotional, cognitive, social, and habitual uses are motivational to use social media, not all uses are consistently gratified. In research examining Facebook groups' users' gratifications in relation to their civic participation offline, 1,715 college students were asked \"to rate their level of agreement with specific reasons for using Facebook groups, including information acquisition about campus/community, entertainment/recreation, social interaction with friends and family, and peer pressure/self satisfaction.\" The study ultimately yielded results through principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. The results showed that there were four needs for using Facebook groups, \"socializing, entertainment, self-status seeking, and information.\"\n\nTwitter is an online micro-blogging platform that contains both mass-media functions and interpersonal communication options via sending tweets. Research has found a positive correlation between active time spent on Twitter and the gratification of a need for \"an informal sense of camaraderie\"—connection—with other users. Furthermore, the frequency of tweets and number of replies and public messages mediated the relationship between Twitter users. This helped increase both use and gratification of the media by satisfying the need for connection.\n\nSnapchat is a photo-sharing social media platform with more than 178 million users worldwide. Similar to other forms of social media, people use Snapchat to fulfill specific media needs. Compared to social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, Snapchat is used more to fulfill private media needs. For example, Phua, Jin, and Kim found that Snapchat interactions were similar to interactions found in close interpersonal relationships. The application has been used to attain emotional support from others, look for advice on important decisions, and seek help to solve problems, satisfying the need to socialize, vent negative feelings, and connect with others.\n\nMany other aspects of UGT are featured in using various websites that are related to social networking. Many review services, such as Yelp.com, have an aspect of social networking, with user profiles and interconnectivity. Many news websites feature the ability to share articles and pictures directly from their page to users' personal social networking pages across platforms. Understandably, information seeking is an overwhelming U&G for these applications, especially the review sites like Yelp.com. Other U&G included entertainment, convenience, interpersonal utility, and passing time. A more sinister aspect of UGT and a reason to use social media establishes a platform for cyberbullying.\n\nPeople engage in cyberbullying online and through social media in order to gratify themselves. Cyberbullying fulfills a need to be vengeful and malicious, while avoiding face-to-face contact. Similarly, besides information seeking, users who share news are motivated by U&G of socializing and status seeking, especially if they have had prior experience with social media.\n\nAs with text messaging, similar U&G were studied with instant messaging, or participating in an \"online chat,\" and these results were also mitigated by gender:\n\nAgain, differences were found based on amount of use and gender. Those who used the instant messaging service frequently (\"heavy users\") were found to be most motivated by affection and sociability; those who did not (\"light users\") were most motivated by fashion. Women chatted longer and for sociability; men chatted for less time per session and for entertainment and relaxation.\n\nThis new branch of research explores the U&G of starting to play games online. Achievement, enjoyment and social interaction are all motivations for starting to play an online game, and their success at the game as well as the extent to which their uses were gratified predicted their continuance in playing.\n\nIn 2017, researchers applied Uses and Gratification Theory to study user behavior among Pokémon Go users. Results show that enjoyment, physical activity, nostalgia, image, normative influences and flow drive various forms of user behavior. In addition, perceived physical risks (but not perceived privacy risks) lead to weaker forms of usage. Findings of this study show that Uses and Gratification theory provides a promising framework to study Augmented Reality, and that U&GT provides a robust framework that can be supplemented with other theories.\n\nIn 2011, a test was conducted with 312 college students to investigate their viewing of animated news. The use of melodramatic animation in news was seen as an emerging technique used in news reporting at the time. The respondents were given 59 statements to rate according to how well each of these statements applies to their viewing of animated news. Factor analysis and hierarchical regression were employed for data analysis.\n\nIn the study, seven motives were identified, through factor analysis, for viewing such animated news videos. These motives included companionship, social interaction, relaxation, information seeking, interpersonal learning, entertainment and pass time.\n\nThe results of hierarchical regression analysis suggest predictive relationships among personality characteristics (sensation seeking and locus of control), the seven motives, the effects of perceived news credibility and newsworthiness, and the intention to share such animated news videos with others.\n\nResearch has shown that media taken in for entertainment purposes (i.e., movies, songs, television, etc.) have a wide range of uses and emotional gratifications, and that these are not mutually exclusive but can overlap with each other. Rehman (1983) demonstrated a relationship between gratifications sought and obtained from the movies and movie attendance.\n\nMedia system dependency theory (MSDT or media dependency theory) has been studied as an offshoot of UGT. However, media dependency theory focuses on audiences' goals for media consumption as the source of their dependency; while uses and gratification theory focuses on audience's needs as drivers for media consumption. MSDT states that as a person becomes increasingly dependent on media to satisfy their needs, that media will become more important in a person's life and thereby have increased influence and effects that person. MSDT acknowledges and builds upon UGT because it is based on the assumptions that people have different uses for media that arise from their needs.\n\nBuilding on UGT, Social Cognitive Theory helped distinguish GS versus GO stimulus for media consumption. Social cognitive theory explains behavior in terms of the reciprocal causation between individuals, environments, and behaviors. This allows for a more personal application of UGT instead of a large, blanketing assumption about a large audience of mass media. If GO is greater than GS then there will be more audience satisfaction. Lastly, audiences' GS are not always the reality of their GO.\n\nCultivation theory is concerned with understanding the role that media play in shaping a person's world view—specifically television. Whereas UGT tries to understand the motivations that drive media usage, Cultivation theory focuses on the psychological effects of media. Cultivation theory is used especially to study violence in television and how it shapes audience's understanding of the reality of violence in society. Often, because of media's influence, audiences have a more heightened and unrealistic perception of the amount of violence. A UGT approach may be implemented to Cultivation theory cases to understand why an audience would seek violent media and if audiences seek television violence to satisfy the need of confirmation of their worldview.\n\nUses and gratifications has, almost since its inception, been viewed by some as the Pluto of communication theory, which is to say critics argue that it does not meet the standards necessary to be theory. Critics argue that it instead is more of an approach to analysis or a data-collecting strategy.\nAmong the criticism most commonly raised in academic literature:\n\nUsing this sociologically-based theory has little to no link to the benefit of psychology due to its weakness in operational definitions and weak analytical mode. It also is focused too narrowly on the individual and neglects the social structure and place of the media in that structure. Ruggiero (2000) wrote that \"most scholars agree that early research had little theoretical coherence and was primarily behaviorist and individualist in its methodological tendencies.\" Blumler (1979) and other critics have argued that line between gratification and satisfaction is blurred, and Blumler wrote that \"the nature of the theory underlying uses and gratifications research is not totally clear.\"\n\nDespite such criticism, contemporary thought suggests that uses and gratifications as theory may be in the process of gaining new life as a result of new communication technology. While it was easy to question the agency of media consumers who had three television networks from which to choose, it's much harder to argue that a consumer who now has 100 cable channels and Internet-streaming video is not making his own decisions. Sundar & Limperos (2013) write that what had been called the \"audience\" is now referred to as \"users,\" and \"usage implies volitional action, not simply passive reception.\"\n\nAmong the most criticized tenets of uses and gratifications as theory is the assumption of an active audience. Ruggerio (2000) noted three assumptions that are necessary to the idea of active audience: First, media selection is initiated by the individual. Second, expectations regarding the use of media must be a product of individual predispositions, social interactions and environmental factors. And third, the active audience exhibits goal-directed behavior. This concept of active audience finds, at best, limited acceptance outside of the United States.\n\nJay Blumler presented a number of interesting points, as to why Uses and Gratifications cannot measure an active audience. He stated, \"The issue to be considered here is whether what has been thought about Uses and Gratifications Theory has been an article of faith and if it could now be converted into an empirical question such as: How to measure an active audience?\" (Blumler, 1979). Blumler then offered suggestions about the kinds of activity the audiences were engaging with in the different types of media.\n\n25 years later, in 1972, Blumler, McQuail and Brown extended Lasswell's four groups. These included four primary factors for which one may use the media:\n\nKatz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973) saw mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others. They developed 35 needs taken from the largely speculative literature on the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:\n\n\n"}
