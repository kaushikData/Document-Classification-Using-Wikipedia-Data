He met her in Poland, through his Polish friends and there he married her. His mother's name was Husnujahan and she lives separate. His brother-in-law (sisters husband) was also nobleman Mamobey Mamayev. He doesnot have any children but he was adopted of the sister's daughter Fatma xanum Malik-Abbas(the fact confirmed by the court of Azerbaijan). After losing his father, he lived with his uncle's family, and later back with his mother who had married a local official. He studied at a two-year Russian-Muslim school, then perfected his Russian at Malik-Hagnazarov's School and in 1884 enrolled in a seven-year Shusha Realschule. In his final year her was transferred to the Realschule in Tiflis. At age 14, he got acquainted with theatre for the first time by watching the adaptation of Mirza Fatali Akhundov's play \"Khirs guldurbasan\". Upon graduating he was admitted to the Saint Petersburg Institute of Transportation Engineering and attended lectures in Oriental Studies at the Saint Petersburg University as a visiting student. During the eight-year period spent in Saint Petersburg, Hagverdiyev also excelled in French, which helped him to get to know traditions of the Western European drama.\n\nIn 1892, Hagverdiyev wrote his first dramatical piece, a comedy entitled \"Yeyarsan gaz atini, gorarsan lazzatini\". The book was almost immediately published thanks to benevolent Muslim societies of the Russian capital. While in Saint Petersburg, Hagverdiyev wrote the first epic tragedy in the Azeri language, \"Daghilan tifag\" (\"The Breaking of Unity\", 1896). In 1899 he returned to Shusha and got involved in theatre directing. Alongside he continued to write plays, namely \"Bakhtsiz javan\" (\"The Unlucky Young Man\", 1900) and \"Pari Jadu\" (\"Nymph Magic\", 1901). In 1907 he finished his historical tragedy \"Agha Mohammad Shah Qajar\", which brought him great fame. Beginning in 1906 Hagverdiyev wrote for the satirical magazine \"Molla Nasraddin\". In 1908 he directed Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov's opera \"Leyli and Majnun\". In 1911–1916 he lived in Agdam having dedicated himself mostly to writing fiction. In the next two years he lived and worked in Tiflis as a reporter for the local Russian-language newspaper. In the period of his activity, he also translated some Russian writers as Gogol and Ostrovsky as well as European writers Shakespeare, Molière, Schiller and others into the Azerbaijani language.\n\nIn 1905 Hagverdiyev was appointed to Shusha's municipal government. In 1906 he was elected to the State Duma of the Russian Empire (Russian Imperial legislative assembly) as a representative of the Elisabethpol Governorate and went off to Saint Petersburg. After its dissolution, Hagverdiyev came back to work in the insurance industry and later in a waterway transportation company. In these years, he often travelled to Iran and Central Asia.\n\nIn 1918, Hagverdiyev, who lived in Tiflis at the time and worked as a court officer, was appointed representative of Georgia's Azeri community in the Parliament of the newly formed Democratic Republic of Georgia. At the same time he taught at an Azeri-language secondary school in Tiflis. In 1919 he accepted the invitation by the government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic to serve as the Azerbaijani consul in Dagestan, and later in Armenia.\n\nAfter Azerbaijan's Sovietization in 1920 Hagverdiyev was appointed head of the department for theatres in the People's Commissariat for Enlightening (early Soviet analogy of the Ministry of Education). In 1921–1931 he worked in the Oriental Studies department of the Azerbaijan State University. In 1923–1935 he was head of the Azerbaijan Society for Scientific Research, of which he was a co-founder. In 1924 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1929 he received the title of an Honoured art worker of Azerbaijan. In 1930–1932 Hagverdiyev was Chair of the Writers' Union of Azerbaijan. He died in Baku in 1933.\n\nAbdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev's 40-year-old productive career in literature was a successful continuation to the dramaturgic traditions initiated by Mirza Fatali Akhundov in the early-to-mid 19th century. In his works and articles he communicated themes like the necessity of mass education and the respect for human rights and liberties. His tragedies were true depictions of contemporary problems. Due to his education, knowledge of Western and Eastern cultures and his refined manners Hagverdiyev was widely known and loved by Azerbaijanis, setting an example to the young generation of writers.\n\nSome correction market grandson of Abdurrahimbey Ahverdiyev (Ahverdoff)\nEldar Malik-Abbas from family archives.\n\nAttachment:\nInformation about family members.\nThe daughter (the fact of adoption is confirmed by the decision of the court of the Republic of Azerbaijan) - Fatma hanum Akhverdiyeva (Akhverdova) Malik-Abbas;\nDaughter's husband Alibey Malik-Abbas;\nGrandson - Tofik Ali oglu Malik-Abbas;\nGranddaughter - Elmira Malik-Abbas;\nGrandson's wife - Adiba Malik-Abbas (Nasirova);\nSpouse of the granddaughter - Mammad Rzayev;\nGreat-grandson - Eldar Tofig oglu Malik-Abbas;\nGreat-granddaughter - Gulnara Tofig qizi Ahmed-zade (Malik-Abbas);\nGreat-granddaughter - Leila Mamed qizi Rzaeva (Malik-Abbas);\nGreat-granddaughter - Nigar Mamed qizi Rzaeva (Malik-Abbas)\n"}
{"id": "12415190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12415190", "title": "Action algebra", "text": "Action algebra\n\nIn algebraic logic, an action algebra is an algebraic structure which is both a residuated semilattice and a Kleene algebra. It adds the star or reflexive transitive closure operation of the latter to the former, while adding the left and right residuation or implication operations of the former to the latter. Unlike dynamic logic and other modal logics of programs, for which programs and propositions form two distinct sorts, action algebra combines the two into a single sort. It can be thought of as a variant of intuitionistic logic with star and with a noncommutative conjunction whose identity need not be the top element. Unlike Kleene algebras, action algebras form a variety, which furthermore is finitely axiomatizable, the crucial axiom being \"a\"•(\"a\" → \"a\")* ≤ \"a\". Unlike models of the equational theory of Kleene algebras (the regular expression equations), the star operation of action algebras is reflexive transitive closure in every model of the equations.\n\nAn action algebra (\"A\", ∨, 0, •, 1, ←, →, *) is an algebraic structure such that (\"A\", ∨, •, 1, ←, →) forms a residuated semilattice while (\"A\", ∨, 0, •, 1, *) forms a Kleene algebra. That is, it is any model of the joint theory of both classes of algebras. Now Kleene algebras are axiomatized with quasiequations, that is, implications between two or more equations, whence so are action algebras when axiomatized directly in this way. However, action algebras have the advantage that they also have an equivalent axiomatization that is purely equational. The language of action algebras extends in a natural way to that of action lattices, namely by the inclusion of a meet operation.\n\nIn the following we write the inequality \"a\" ≤ \"b\" as an abbreviation for the equation \"a\" ∨ \"b\" = \"b\". This allows us to axiomatize the theory using inequalities yet still have a purely equational axiomatization when the inequalities are expanded to equalities.\n\nThe equations axiomatizing action algebra are those for a residuated semilattice, together with the following equations for star.\n\nThe first equation can be broken out into three equations, 1 ≤ \"a\"*, \"a\"*•\"a\"* ≤ \"a\"*, and \"a\" ≤ \"a\"*. These force \"a\"* to be reflexive, transitive, and greater or equal to \"a\" respectively. The second axiom asserts that star is monotone. The third axiom can be written equivalently as \"a\"•(\"a\"→\"a\")* ≤ \"a\", a form which makes its role as induction more apparent. These two axioms in conjunction with the axioms for a residuated semilattice force \"a\"* to be the least reflexive transitive element of the semilattice greater or equal to \"a\". Taking that as the definition of reflexive transitive closure of \"a\", we then have that for every element \"a\" of any action algebra, \"a\"* is the reflexive transitive closure of \"a\".\n\nThe equational theory of the implication-free fragment of action algebras, those equations not containing → or ←, can be shown to coincide with the equational theory of Kleene algebras, also known as the regular expression equations. In that sense the above axioms constitute a finite axiomatization of regular expressions. Redko showed in 1967 that these equations had no finite axiomatization, for which John Horton Conway gave a shorter proof in 1971. Salomaa gave an equation schema axiomatizing this theory which Kozen subsequently reformulated as a finite axiomatization using quasiequations or implications between equations, the crucial quasiequations being those of induction: if \"x\"•\"a\" ≤ \"x\" then \"x\"•\"a\"* ≤ \"x\", and if \"a\"•\"x\" ≤ \"x\" then \"a\"*•\"x\" ≤ \"x\". Kozen defined a Kleene algebra to be any model of this finite axiomatization.\n\nConway showed that the equational theory of regular expressions admit models in which \"a\"* was not the reflexive transitive closure of \"a\", by giving a four-element model 0 ≤ 1 ≤ \"a\" ≤ \"a\"* in which \"a\"•\"a\" = \"a\". In Conway's model, \"a\" is reflexive and transitive, whence its reflexive transitive closure should be \"a\". However the regular expressions do not enforce this, allowing \"a\"* to be strictly greater than \"a\". Such anomalous behavior is not possible in an action algebra.\n\nAny Heyting algebra (and hence any Boolean algebra) is made an action algebra by taking • to be ∧ and \"a\"* = 1. This is necessary and sufficient for star because the top element 1 of a Heyting algebra is its only reflexive element, and is transitive as well as greater or equal to every element of the algebra.\n\nThe set 2 of all formal languages (sets of finite strings) over an alphabet Σ forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty set, 1 = {ε}, ∨ as union, • as concatenation, \"L\"←\"M\" as the set of all strings \"x\" such that \"xM\" ⊆ \"L\" (and dually for \"M\"→\"L\"), and \"L\"* as the set of all strings of strings in \"L\" (Kleene closure).\n\nThe set 2 of all binary relations on a set \"X\" forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty relation, 1 as the identity relation or equality, ∨ as union, • as relation composition, \"R\"←\"S\" as the relation consisting of all pairs (\"x,y\") such that for all \"z\" in \"X\", \"ySz\" implies \"xRz\" (and dually for \"S\"→\"R\"), and \"R*\" as the reflexive transitive closure of \"R\", defined as the union over all relations \"R\" for integers \"n\" ≥ 0.\n\nThe two preceding examples are power sets, which are Boolean algebras under the usual set theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complement. This justifies calling them Boolean action algebras. The relational example constitutes a relation algebra equipped with an operation of reflexive transitive closure. Note that every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra and therefore an action algebra by virtue of being an instance of the first example.\n\n\n"}

Nothing is known about him except from a story preserved by the scholiast Helenius Acron, in his notes on the satires of Horace. The scholiast assumes the \"Alfenus Vafer\" of Horace to be the lawyer, and says that he was a native of Cremona, where he carried on the trade of a barber or a botcher of shoes, that he came to Rome to become a student of Servius, attained the dignity of consulship, and was honored with a public funeral.\n\nPomponius also states that Varus attained consulship, but this will not prove the rest of the scholiast's story to be true. The Publius Alfenius Varus who was consul in 2 AD can hardly be the pupil of Servius; and it is conjectured that he may have been the jurist's son. It is impossible to determine what credit is due to the scholiast on Horace: he must have found the story somewhere, or have invented it. Indeed, he and other scholiasts do sometimes favor us with a commentary which tells us nothing more than the text. The fact of an Alfenus being a native of Cremona, and of an Alfenus having been a pupil of Servius, and a learned jurist, and of an Alfenus having been consul, is quite enough to enable a scholiast with the assistance of the passage in Horace to fabricate the whole story of Alfenus, as he has given it.\n\nThere are 54 excerpts in the \"Pandects\" from the 40 books of the \"Digesta\" of Alfenus; but it is conjectured that Alfenus may have acted only as the editor of the work of Servius. It appears from the fragments of Alfenus that he was acquainted with the Greek language, and these fragments show that he wrote in a pure and perspicuous style. A passage that appears in the \"Pandects\" shows that he was not a stranger to the speculations of the philosophers. According to Aulus Gellius, Alfenus was somewhat curious in matters of antiquity, and Gellius quotes a passage from the thirty-fourth book of his Digest in which Alfenus mentions one of the terms of a treaty between the Romans and the Carthaginians. Alfenus is often cited by later jurists. The fragments in the \"Pandects\" are taken from the second to the seventh books of the Digest and there are fragments from the eighth book taken from the epitome by the jurist Paulus. The entire number of books appears from the Florentine Index; the passage in Gellius quotes the thirty-fourth book; and a passage of Paulus cites the forty-ninth book. Whether the epitome of Paulus went further than the eighth book or not, is uncertain.\n\nThe passage in Gellius: \"\"Alfenus ... in libro Digestorum trigesimo et quarto, Conjectaneorum autem secundo\",\" (\"Alfenus says in the Digest and in the Conlectanea\") &c., has given rise to some discussion. It is clear that the passage in the Conlectanea is attributed to Alfenus, and it is also clear that only one passage is meant; or at most the same passage is referred to as being in two different works. But apparently only one work is meant, and therefore we must conclude that the \"Digesta\", which consisted of forty books, contained a subdivision called the Conlectanea. Some critics have conjectured that the Conlectanea is the compilation of Aufidius Namusa, so that the passage cited by Gellius appeared in both the original work by Alfenus, and in the copious compilation of Namusa, which is made from Alfenus and other pupils of Servius.\n\n"}
{"id": "764014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=764014", "title": "Alois Carigiet", "text": "Alois Carigiet\n\nAlois Carigiet (30 August 1902 – 1 August 1985) was a Swiss graphic designer, painter, and illustrator. He may be known best for six children's picture books set in the Alps, \"A Bell for Ursli\" and its sequels, written by Selina Chönz, and three that he wrote himself. In 1966 he received the inaugural Hans Christian Andersen Medal for children's illustrators.\n\nAlois Carigiet was the seventh of eleven children born to Alois Carigiet and Barbara Maria Carigiet, \"née\" Lombriser; the actor and comedian Zarli Carigiet was one younger brother. It was a farm family in Trun in the canton of Graubünden, where he grew up and spent his first school years. At home, the family spoke \"Sursilvan\", the local Romansh dialect of the anterior Rhine valley. In 1911, economic hardship forced them to move to the canton's German-speaking capital Chur where his father found employment. This relocation into a more urban environment had a strong impact on the nine-year-old. In retrospect, Carigiet described the move as an \"emigration to the low-lands\", from a \"mountain boy's paradise\" to a \"gloomy apartment on the ground floor in a narrow town alley\".\n\nCarigiet visited primary and secondary schools in Chur, as well as the \"Kantonsschule\", the canton's gymnasium, which he quit in 1918 in order to start an apprenticeship as a decorative designer and draftsman with master painter Martin Räth. While learning the art of graining, marbleizing, gold plating and other techniques of decorative art in Räth's atelier, Carigiet spent a lot of his spare time filling volumes of sketchbooks with drawings of rural and urban scenes, farm animals and pets, anatomical studies of heads and beaks of the birds exhibited at Chur's natural history museum, as well as with numerous caricatures of his acquaintances and family. Räth noticed the apprentice's talent as well, and one of Carigiet's appointed creations, an assembly of decorated vases for the Siebler & Co. shop windows, seems to have received particular appreciation. Carigiet finished his apprenticeship in 1923, with the highest grade in every subject.\n\nAfter having completed his apprenticeship, Carigiet sought work in Zurich and started a job as a practical trainee with Max Dalang's advertisement agency in 1923, where he soon learned the techniques of graphic design and was hired as a regular employee. After having won several competitions and having gained a reputation, Carigiet opened his own graphic atelier in Zurich in 1927, employing up to six people at times, due to the constantly large volume of orders his business received. Carigiet created numerous commercial and political advertisement posters, festive decorations, educational posters and murals for schools, illustrations and satirical caricatures for the print media, as well as magazine covers for periodicals such as \"Schweizer Spiegel\" and \"SBB-Revue\". Important work in the 1930s included a diorama for the Swiss Pavilion at the Paris International world fair in 1937, and set designs, murals and the official posters for the \"Landi\", the Swiss national exposition held in Zurich in 1939.\n\nThough he had never studied visual arts in the academic sense, Carigiet's early graphic design was already strongly influenced by contemporary artists, such as El Lissitzky, whose use of photomontage in a poster announcing the exhibition of Russian avant-garde artists in Zurich, in 1928, inspired the design of a political campaign poster for Zurich's mayor Emil Klöti. In the early 1930s Carigiet traveled to Paris, Munich, Vienna, and Salzburg where he became acquainted with the art movement \"Neue Sachlichkeit\", as reflected in painted scenes of Paris in \"Das rote Haus am Montmartre\" (watercolor) and of Ascona in \"Haus und Garten in Ascona\" (oil painting on cardboard), both created in 1935. Contemporary expressionism had an influence on his work as well, including his commercial artwork. For example, the display of red horses and a green cow on posters for the OLMA, Switzerland’s annual national agricultural fair, in 1946 and 1952 received acclaim from art critics and questions from more conservative farmers, to which he succinctly replied that the cow was green because it had eaten grass.\nCarigiet's paintings increasingly depicted everyday motifs from his home canton Graubünden and occasionally Zurich, but also from further trips to France, Spain, and Lapland in the mid-1930s.\n\nCarigiet always held a keen interest in the theatre, and had already worked in costume design in the late 1920s. With the help of art critic Jakob Rudolf Welti, he was commissioned as costume and stage designer for the Stadttheater Zürich performance of \"La belle Hélène\" in an adaptation by Max Werner Lenz, and created design work for three other programs at the Stadttheater as well. Carigiet was one of the founding members of the influential Cabaret Cornichon, a satirical cabaret program staged in the restaurant \"zum Hirschen\" in Zurich which would become one of the most significant political cabarets of German-speaking Switzerland during Germany's Nazi regime. Carigiet designed the Cabaret's logo, a grinning cornichon (gherkin) with a carrot-nose, and from 1935 to 1946 he created often parodistic costume and set designs for ten of the Cornichon’s programs, including a heavily decorated barrel organ used by his brother Zarli who was also a member of the Cabaret's ensemble.\n\nWhile spending a holiday in Trun in May 1939, Carigiet hiked to \"Platenga\", a hamlet on one of the terraces in the community of Obersaxen, where, in his own words, he was immediately fascinated by the landscape's vastness and untouchedness and the feeling of a newly found, long lost paradise. He gave up his business in Zurich, and, in October 1939, rented a small farm house without electricity or running water, the \"Hüs am Bach\" (\"house at the stream\") in Platenga. Carigiet wished to dedicate his life to art and observation, spending hours a day, equipped with a pair of binoculars and a sketch book, tracking down the alpine fauna.\n\nOn 20 April 1943, Carigiet married Berta Carolina Müller (1911–1980) an art student from Halle whom he had met in Germany. After their first daughter was born in 1944, they bought land near Platenga's chapel. In 1945 Carigiet designed plans for a larger house which was built in 1946. In 1947, the second daughter was born in the new house, called \"Im Sunnefang\". Mainly for the sake of the girls' education, the family moved back to Zurich in 1950, where Carigiet took up his work as a graphic designer again, while also continuing his artistic pursuits.\n\nIn 1940, Carigiet was approached by the Romansh-speaking author Selina Chönz who asked him to illustrate her story \"Uorsin\" to create a children's picture book. After several years of hesitating, Carigiet finally agreed, and spent several weeks sketching the scenery and architecture in Guarda, Chönz's home village in the Lower Engadin, after which he modeled the protagonist's village. In October 1945 the book was published in German as \"Uorsin (Schellen-Ursli. Ein Engadiner Bilderbuch)\" and later in English as \"A Bell for Ursli\" (1950). The story follows the boy Ursli's perilous climb through snow to an abandoned summer hut in order to retrieve a large \"trychel\" for the annual Chalandamarz celebration on 1 March. The book has been translated into ten languages with total sales estimated around 1.7 million worldwide. Carigiet's dramatic and colorful compositions were noticed and positively reviewed by art critics including Manuel Gasser in \"Graphis Inc.\" or Linus Birchler, editor-in-chief of the series \"Art Monuments of Switzerland\" and member of the Swiss Federal Art Commission.\n\nCarigiet and Chönz created a series of Alpine children's books with two sequels featuring Ursli's younger sister: \"Flurina (Flurina und das Wildvögelein. Schellen-Ursli's Schwester)\" in 1952 (English title: \"Florina and the Wild Bird\") and \"La naivera (Der grosse Schnee)\" in 1957 (\"The Snowstorm\"). In the 1960s, Carigiet continued on his own, illustrating \"and\" writing \"Zottel, Zick und Zwerg. Eine Geschichte von drei Geissen\" in 1965 (\"Anton the Goatherd\"), \"Birnbaum, Birke, Berberitze. Eine Geschichte aus den Bündner Bergen\" in 1967 (\"The Pear Tree, the Birch Tree and the Barberry Bush\"), and \"Maurus und Madleina. Über den Berg in die Stadt\" in 1969 (\"Anton and Anne\"). In 1966, he was awarded the Schweizer Jugendbuchpreis (Swiss youth book prize) for \"Zottel, Zick und Zwerg\".\n\nThe biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award, conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People and first awarded in 1956, is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Carigiet received the inaugural Illustrator award in 1966.\n\nIn 1960, Carigiet bought the house \"Flutginas\" (ferns) located above Trun, his village of childhood, where he would spend the rest of his life dedicated to painting. In a speech held in Zurich in 1962, he described his works as \"narrative art\" in a century of abstraction, and named Georges Rouault, \"the greatest of all\", as an exemplary inspiration for his artistic approach. Until 1982, he frequently exhibited his artwork in Switzerland, but also in Toronto (1969) and Frankfurt (1971). Alois Carigiet died on 1 August 1985 in Trun.\n\n\n"}

They are required to be worn by one team during a game between teams that would otherwise wear the same colours as each other, or similar colours. This change prevents confusion for officials, players, and spectators. In most sports, it is the visiting or road team that must change – second-choice kits are commonly known as away kits or change kits in British English, and road uniforms in American English.\n\nSome sports leagues mandate that away teams must always wear an alternative kit, while others simply state that the two teams' colours should not match. In some sports, conventionally the \"home\" team has changed its kit (such as in rugby union).\n\nIn most cases, a team wears its away kit only when its primary kit would clash with the colours of the home team. However, sometimes teams wear away colours by choice, occasionally even in a home game. At some clubs, the away kit has become more popular than the home version. Replica home and away kits are usually available for fans to buy. Some teams also have produced third-choice kits, or even old-fashioned throwback uniforms.\n\nIn North American sports, road teams typically wear a change uniform regardless of a potential colour clash. \"Color vs. color\" games (e.g., blue jerseys vs. red jerseys) are a rarity, having been discouraged in the era of black-and-white television. Almost all road uniforms are white in gridiron football (including in the Canadian Football League, the National Football League and NCAA football) and the National Hockey League, while in baseball, visitors typically wear grey. In the National Basketball Association and NCAA basketball, home uniforms are white or yellow, and visiting teams wear the darker colour.\n\nMost teams choose to wear their colour jerseys at home, with the road team changing to white in most cases. White road uniforms gained prominence with the rise of television in the 1950s. A \"white vs. color\" game was easier to follow in black-and-white. According to Phil Hecken, \"until the mid 1950′s, not only was color versus color common in the NFL, it was actually the norm.\" Even long after the advent of colour television, the use of white jerseys has remained in almost every game.\n\nThe NFL's current rules require that a team's home jerseys must be \"either white or official team color\" throughout the season, \"and visiting clubs must wear the opposite\". If a team insists on wearing its home uniforms on the road, the NFL Commissioner must judge on whether their uniforms are \"of sufficient contrast\" with those of their opponents. The road team might instead wear a third jersey, such as the Seattle Seahawks' \"Wolf Grey\" alternate.\n\nAccording to the Gridiron Uniform Database, the Cleveland Browns wore white for every home game of the 1955 season. The only times they wore brown was for games at Philadelphia and the New York Giants, when the Eagles and Giants chose to wear white.\n\nIn 1964 the Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns, Minnesota Vikings and Los Angeles Rams wore white regularly for their home games according to Tim Brulia's research. The St. Louis Cardinals wore white for several of their home games, as well as the Dallas Cowboys; while most teams switched back to colors the next year, the Rams and Browns still regularly wore white until the 1970s.\n\nUntil 1964 Dallas had worn blue at home, but it was not an official rule that teams should wear their coloured jerseys at home. The use of white jerseys was introduced by general manager (GM) Tex Schramm, who wanted fans to see a variety of opponents' jersey colours at home games. The Cowboys still wear white at home today.\n\nWhite has also been worn regularly at home by the Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles, and several other NFL teams. Teams in cities with hot climates often choose white jerseys at home during the first half of the season, because light colours absorb and retain less heat in sunlight – as such, the Dolphins, who stay white year-round, will typically use their coloured jerseys for home night games. Every current NFL team except the Seattle Seahawks has worn white at home at some time in its history.\n\nDuring the successful Joe Gibbs era, the Washington Redskins chose to wear white exclusively at home in the 1980s and 1990s, including the 1982 NFC Championship Game against Dallas. Since 2001 the Redskins have chosen to wear white jerseys and burgundy jerseys roughly equally in their home games, but they still wear white against the Cowboys. When Gibbs returned from 2004 to 2007, they wore white at home exclusively. In 2007, they wore a white throwback jersey.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be \"jinxed\" because of defeats at Super Bowl V in 1971 (when they were forced to wear their blue jerseys as the designated 'home' team), and in the 1968 divisional playoffs at Cleveland, Don Meredith's final game as a Cowboys player. Dallas's only victory in a conference championship or Super Bowl wearing the blue jerseys was in the 1978 NFC Championship game at the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSuper Bowl rules later changed to allow the designated home team to pick their choice of jersey. White was chosen by the Cowboys (XIII, XXVII), the Redskins (XVII), the Pittsburgh Steelers (XL), the Denver Broncos (50), and the New England Patriots (LII). The latter three teams normally wear colours at home, but Pittsburgh had worn white in three road playoff wins, while Denver cited its previous Super Bowl success in white jerseys (XXXIII), while being 0–4 when wearing orange in Super Bowls.\n\nOccasionally, teams playing against Dallas at home wear their white jerseys to try to invoke the \"curse\", as when the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Cowboys in the 1980 NFC Championship Game. Teams including the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Giants followed suit in the 1980s, and the Carolina Panthers did so from 1995 until 2006, including two playoff games. The Houston Texans did so in 2002, beating Dallas in their inaugural regular season game. More recently, the Patriots and then-St. Louis Rams tried the same tactic.\n\nThe originator of white home jerseys in the NFL at Dallas, Tex Schramm, said he did not believe in the curse.\n\nStarting in 2014, the Panthers, who like many teams typically switch from white to colour in October or November, have worn white at home in the postseason regardless of their opponent; the franchise has never won a playoff game while wearing coloured jerseys, including in Super Bowl 50, when the Broncos chose to wear white. \n\nWhile they had only done so twice, both to \"jinx\" Dallas, during the 21 years they played in St. Louis, since returning to Los Angeles in 2016, the Rams, temporarily playing in the same stadium as they had in the 1960s, have worn white at home as a conscious tribute to the highly successful teams of that era.\n\nColoured road uniforms were used in the World Football League (WFL) during its short period of existence in 1974–75, with the home team wearing white, and college football teams must base their road uniform around a white jersey.\n\nWhile a team's primary kit rarely undergoes major changes, the second colours tend to vary over time and sometimes by tournament. Some away kits are a modification of the home colours (for example a reversal of primary and secondary colours), other away kits are considerably different from home kits. Several club and national sides have favourite away colours which might remain the same more or less continuously. Often these are colours that were used in famous victories; for instance A.C. Milan (white) and Brazil (blue). Many professional clubs also have an official third kit, ostensibly to be used if both their first-choice and away colours are deemed too similar to those of an opponent.\n\nIt is not unknown for teams to opt to wear their away colours even when not required to by a clash of colours. England sometimes play in red shirts even when not required, as the team wore red when it won the 1966 World Cup held on home soil. Despite being drawn as the \"home\" team for the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Liverpool F.C., A.C. Milan chose to wear their all-white away strip; they consider that strip to be their \"lucky kit\" (), having won the European Cup five times in those colours. However, Milan had also lost two finals wearing all-white, most recently against Liverpool in 2005.\n\nIn some title-deciding matches, a team has won the game wearing its away kit, but changed to home shirts for the trophy presentation – most notably when Spain won the 2010 World Cup final in their dark-blue away kit, but changed to red home shirts to lift the trophy.\n\nIn some cases both teams have been forced to wear their second choice away kits; such as the match between Netherlands and Brazil in the 1974 FIFA World Cup where they wore white and dark blue rather than their first choice of orange and yellow, respectively; and the match between Netherlands and Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup where they wore dark blue and white (Spain's third choice colors) rather than their home colors of orange and red, respectively. During the 1998-99 UEFA Champions League, Manchester United F.C. had to wear their away colors in both of their group stage matches against F.C. Barcelona, not just away at Camp Nou but also home at Old Trafford too.\n\nIn England in 1890, the Football League, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change colours in the event of a clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.\nIn 1927 the Scottish Football Association decreed a different solution, whereby home teams wore white shorts and away teams black shorts, but this rule was rescinded in 1929.\n\nIt is normal for individual competitions to specify that all outfield players on a team must wear the same colours, though the Law states only \"The two teams must wear colours that distinguish them from each other and the match officials\". In the event of a colour clash, the away team must change to a different colour.\n\nAway kits were often worn by both teams in English FA Cup matches. Until 1989-90, its competition rules stated: \"Where the colours of the two competing clubs are similar, both clubs must change unless alternative arrangements are mutually agreed by the competing clubs\". Clubs sometimes needed to find makeshift third kits for their players. Many FA Cup finals were played under these rules, the last being the 1982 Final and replay. In European competition, the 1968 European Cup Final was played under similar rules.\n\nThe old FA Cup rules, with almost identical wording, are still used in semis and finals by many county and district football associations in England.\n\nAt international level, away kits are sometimes worn by both teams in a match. FIFA rules state, \"In exceptional cases, both teams may be asked to wear different Colours\" by the referee or match commissioner. This is most likely to happen in World Cup matches with large numbers of black-and-white television viewers, so that the teams' kits also differ in tone (light and dark). World Cup teams often have to make changes that would be unlikely in domestic or untelevised games. In 1957 Scotland borrowed home team Switzerland's white away shirts to avoid clashing on black-and-white television. More recent instances include the match between Netherlands and Brazil in the 1974 FIFA World Cup where they wore white and dark blue rather than their first choice of orange and yellow, respectively; and the match between Netherlands and Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup where they wore dark blue and white (Spain's third choice, as their second choice was black) rather than their home colours of orange and red, respectively. FIFA’s regulations for the 2014 World Cup \"mandate that teams need to have two very distinguishable shirts — where one is a lighter colour and the other is a darker one\". \n\nIn 1970 England and Czechoslovakia were allowed to play in sky blue and white, respectively, which caused confusion for black-and-white viewers and England manager Alf Ramsey. England reverted to red shirts against West Germany. \n\nBefore the 2014 World Cup FIFA decreed that Spain's all-red home kit and all-black away kit were not sufficient as they were both considered dark tones, and forced the team to produce an all-white third kit. Croatia were allowed to wear red-and-white checked shirts, instead of blue, against Brazil, only after Croatia appealed FIFA's original decision. England were not allowed to wear red away shirts, and instead were made to wear white against Uruguay, due to an apparent clash with officials' uniforms. In the 2018 FIFA World Cup third place match, both Belgium and England wore their away colours of yellow and red, respectively, even though both teams were permitted to wear their respective home colours of red and white in their group stage match.\n\nThree teams have won the World Cup final in their away colours – in 1958 (Brazil), 1966 (England), and 2010 (Spain); though England was the home team for the 1966 tournament.\n\nHost teams typically wear home colours for the duration of the tournament, for instance Germany played every game at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in its home white colours while the away colours (changed from black to red at the request of then-manager Jürgen Klinsmann in 2005) never made an appearance on the pitch. There have been some exceptions, however, as England wore their away red colours in the 1966 World Cup Final, while in 2018 Russia wore their away white colours against Uruguay and Spain.\n\nOriginally, Major League Baseball teams were primarily distinguished by the colours of their stockings. In 1882, the National League assigned different stocking colours to the member clubs; the league also assigned jersey and cap colours, but by player position rather than by club.\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds were known as the \"Red Legs\" and \"Red Stockings\" during the early 1900s.\nBy the end of the 19th century, it became common for teams to wear white at home, and grey in road games. Some teams used road uniforms of solid dark blue or black. An early example of this is the Brooklyn Superbas, who started to use a blue pattern for their road uniforms in 1907. Both the home and away teams' uniforms also contained trim in the team colours.\n\nIn 1916, on the New York Giants' road uniforms, purple lines gave their uniforms a tartan-like effect and another kind of road uniform was a solid dark blue or black material with white around this time. The Kansas City Athletics home and road uniforms were changed by Charles O. Finley in 1963, to the colours of gold and green. Some teams used powder blue for their road uniforms from the 1970s to the early 1990s.\n\nAside from the obvious need to distinguish one team from the other, conventional wisdom held that it was more difficult to properly launder uniforms while on a road trip, thus the \"road grays\" helped to hide accumulated soil. This convention continued well after its original premise was nullified by the issuance of multiple uniforms and the growth of the laundromat industry.\n\nTypically, home uniforms feature the team's nickname, while away uniforms feature the name of the team's geographic designation; there are ten teams that are exceptions to this rules: the Tampa Bay Rays, Los Angeles Angels, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, Washington Nationals, Miami Marlins, Texas Rangers, Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees.\n\nThe Tigers, Nationals and Yankees all wear their cap insignia on the left breast of their home jerseys, but the city name on their away jerseys. \n\nIn addition to this, some teams have featured mainly their team's location presented on their uniforms both at home and on the road. Examples include the Rangers and Marlins, whose alternate orange jersey is the only one of the team's four to feature the nickname instead of the city name. Some teams have alternate home uniforms featuring location such as the Colorado Rockies and St. Louis Cardinals. The Brewers have worn a navy jersey with \"Milwaukee\" on the front frequently both at home and on the road since 2015, while the Los Angeles Dodgers have worn an alternate grey jersey with the nickname instead of the city name for most away games since 2014. \n\nFrom 1973 to 2008, the Baltimore Orioles were part of this group – the omission of the city's name being part of a largely successful effort to attract fans from the Washington, D.C. area – before returning \"Baltimore\" to the road jerseys in 2009, by which time their neighbour 35 miles (55 km) to the south once again had a team of its own.\n\nUntil the 2017–18 season, the rules of the National Basketball Association (NBA) stated: \"The home team shall wear light color jerseys, and the visitors dark jerseys unless otherwise approved. For neutral court games and doubleheaders, the second team named in the official schedule shall be regarded as the home team and shall wear the light colored jerseys.\" Most teams' home uniforms are white, with some exceptions, such as the Los Angeles Lakers, who wear gold at home (although in 2002, to honour Chick Hearn, Jeanie Buss had a white jersey introduced as the third uniform, worn at home). But, according to this rule, road uniforms are required at every game in the NBA. \"Dark\" colours worn in road games vary widely among teams.\n\nBeginning with the 2017–18 season, the home team is allowed to designate whether it will wear a white or coloured jersey. The visiting team must wear a jersey of sufficient contrast, whether it be white or another colour.\n\nThe use of specially-designed Christmas uniforms in NBA games in 2012 led to several \"color vs. color\" match-ups.\n\nIn NCAA Division I college basketball, the home team almost universally wears white uniforms, while the visiting team wears colours. There are exceptions, such as the University of Michigan, Louisiana State University and West Virginia University wearing yellow at home, or the University of Illinois wearing orange at home, if it sufficiently contrasts with the visiting team's uniforms.\n\nAway kits are a recent development in cricket, which has been played in all-white clothing for most of its history. The first professional match played in coloured clothing was in World Series Cricket in Australia in 1979. The first Cricket World Cup to use coloured kits was the 1992 tournament.\n\nThe England team uses one kit for all home and away ODI and Twenty20 matches. India also uses a light blue kit for both.\n\nAustralia, however, has a separate green ODI home kit, yellow ODI away kit, and black T20 kit. The home kit is the same colour as the famous \"baggy green\" cap traditionally worn by Australian Test cricketers, but the yellow away kit is often worn by the Australian team in home matches.\n\nIn the NHL each team is currently required to have two uniform designs: one with a white base (or sometimes historically, a light colour), and one with a darker-coloured base. From the 1970–71 season to the 2002–03 season, NHL teams wore lighter colours or white at home and the darker colours on the road. When the Third Jersey Program was introduced in the 1995–96 season, some teams wore third jerseys at home, thus requiring the road team to wear the white. This problem was rectified at the start of the 2003–04 season, as NHL teams started to wear the dark colour at home and the white for road games; there are occasional single-game exceptions. The only element allowed by NHL rules to be interchangeable between the two uniforms is the pants.\n\nIn the minor leagues, teams historically wore white or light colours at home and dark colours on the road.\n\nAway colours are used by Jamaica and Australia, two top international teams who both have yellow home kits. Jamaica's change kit is all-black, Australia's is all-green. When the teams meet, one usually changes its kits but there have been games such as a 2011 Test where each team wore predominantly yellow, with Jamaica in black skirts.\n\nAlternate colours are also used where required in the Australasian ANZ Championship.\n\nIt is traditional in rugby (as it was in soccer prior to 1921) for the home team to change in the event of a clash. This stems partly from teams touring overseas; it was easier for the home side to get an alternate kit. The World Rugby rules for tours do not state this outright: it is the responsibility of the WR CEO or representative \"to resolve the matter\", but \"in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the Host Union shall be entitled to wear its home kit.\" In English RFU level 3 to 5 competition, if there is a clash the away team must change.\n\nAt Rugby World Cups, colour clashes are decided by a coin-toss for first choice of kits. In the 2007 quarter-final between France and New Zealand, the recently redesigned French kit was dark blue and black, and clashed with the All Blacks' kit. The toss went in favour of France, and New Zealand wore silver shirts in the game in Cardiff. However, in the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final between those teams, France won the toss and chose to play in its white away kit. France's team manager Jo Maso said this decision was because of \"the welcome they’d received from the people of New Zealand, the faultless organisation of the tournament and the honour and pleasure of playing... [at] Eden Park\".\n\nEngland used an all-black second kit at the 2011 World Cup, which caused controversy in the host nation, as black is the home colour of New Zealand. England wore the kit in one tournament match, against Argentina. Critics in England in 2010 said the team was changing away kits unnecessarily and too often as a \"marketing ploy\". Australia, on the other hand, has rarely worn an away kit except against Romania; a white jersey would have been worn in 2011.\n\nIn international rugby, the need for second kits arises most often in the Six Nations, where Scotland, France and Italy all play in different shades of blue. The tournament takes the form of a single round-robin with home advantage alternating each year, and it is scheduled so that each of the three aforementioned sides plays one of the other two at home and the other away in a given season. In turn, this means that each of these three sides will play one home game in its alternate jersey. These have traditionally been white, but in the 2015 Six Nations Scotland and France adopted red as their alternate colour.\n\nIreland's green jersey is complemented by two away jerseys, one which is white in colour and one which is navy in colour.\n\n\n"}

A Thai translation of the Apocrypha is also available from Thai Catholic booksellers.\n\nThe earliest known attempt at a translation of the Bible into Thai is a free translation of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke, starting at verse 5. This was translated in 1685 by Louis Laneau of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. \n\nThe first Protestant effort at Thai Bible translation was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew by Ann Judson. Karl Gützlaff and Jacob Tomlin, who are regarded as the first two resident Protestant missionaries in Thailand, translated the four Gospels and Romans from Chinese into Thai. They were assisted by a Chinese man and a Burmese man, both of whom spoke Thai. John Taylor Jones, an ABMU missionary, translated the New Testament from Greek into the Thai language. Part of the Bible in Thai was first published in 1834. Jones' translation of the New Testament in Thai was printed for the first time in 1846. The translation of the Old Testament was finished in 1883 and the Bible with the complete Protestant canon in Thai was published as a single volume for the first time in 1894. This edition of the Bible was later revised by the Thailand Bible Society using the King James Version (KJV) as the base text and published as the Thai Standard Version in 1940. This translation was subsequently revised using the Revised Standard Version (RSV) and Authorized Standard Version (ASV) as the base text and republished in 1971.\n\nIn addition to the Thai Bible, several other language Bible translations are used in Thailand, especially among ethnic minorities. These include Chinese, Lao, Burmese, Cambodian, Malay, Karen, Akha, Hmong, Lahu, Lawa, and Shan.\n\n"}
{"id": "3815066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3815066", "title": "Carnal knowledge", "text": "Carnal knowledge\n\nCarnal knowledge is an archaic or legal euphemism for sexual intercourse. In modern statutes, the term \"sexual penetration\" is widely used, though with various definitions.\n\nThe term derives from the Biblical usage of the verb \"know/knew\", as in the King James Bible and other versions, a euphemism for sexual conduct.\n\nExamples of this usage include the first part of the Bible, the Book of Genesis, which describes how Adam and Eve conceived their first child:\n\nAnd in Lot’s plea to the people of Sodom to whom he offered his virgin daughters, in place of his guests:\n\nIn criminal law, the term has had different meanings at different times and in different jurisdictions. While commonly a mere euphemism for sexual intercourse (not necessarily unlawful), different jurisdictions have defined carnal knowledge (as well as sexual intercourse) as a specific sex act such as contact between a penis and vagina, some laws elaborating this to include even \"slight penile penetration of female sex organs\". The definition sometimes includes a set of sex acts that include sodomy, while some statutes specifically exclude such acts. Some laws do not define the term, and leave it to the courts to give it meaning, which also allows them to take into account changing community standards.\n\nCarnal knowledge has also sometimes meant sexual intercourse outside of marriage, and sometimes refers to sex with someone under the age of consent. The phrase is often found in this sense in modern legal usage, being equivalent to statutory rape in some jurisdictions, as the term \"rape\" implies lack of consent.\n\nA related term is carnal abuse, which is defined by Dictionary.com as \"any lascivious contact with the sexual organs of a child by an adult\". Usually, but not always, this does not involve penetration.\n\nSection 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828 reads as follows:\n\nThe crimes of carnally abusing girls referred to were those created by section 17 of the Act.\n\nIn cases decided under this section it was held that the slightest penetration was sufficient.\n\nThis section was replaced by section 63 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The term was not used in the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which replaced it, where it appeared, with the term \"sexual intercourse\", in all the provisions consolidated by that Act.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41241851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41241851", "title": "Coil waste", "text": "Coil waste\n\nCoil waste is a type of U.S. stamp made from damaged or unusable printing stock intended for use as coil stamps and is a term applied to several stamp issues of the late 1910s and early 20s. Sometimes in the printing of coils on rotary presses, a number stamps from the run were deemed unusable for coil production. Instead of discarding these, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing processed them through the flat-plate perforating machine to finish them as fully perforated stamps. These finished products are known as coil waste. While seemingly identical to normal fully perforated issues (which were printed on flat plate presses), coil waste stamps are distinguishable by their size: their designs are slightly wider or longer than normal because rotary press printing slightly stretches an image.\n\nThe stamps removed from coil production in the late teens and early twenties were \"discarded as unfit,\" according to a report from a director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing \"on account of narrow margins, too close perforations and other reasons.\" A notable example is a 1919 1¢ Washington stamp (Scott Catalogue #538). This, according to Max Johl, had \"received the regulation one way [vertical] coil perforation while forming part of the long rolls of stamps printed on the rotary press. The coil perforating machines…fitted for perforating rolls of stamps could not be used to perforate sheets, so these [stamps] had to be perforated the other way (horizontally) on the regulation eleven gauge flat plate perforating machines.\" The rarest coil waste issue from the Washington-Franklin series is another 1¢ Washington stamp produced in 1921 (Scott #544). Other Washington-Franklin examples include Scott #539-541.\nIn 1923, during the production of the U. S. Fourth Bureau definitive series, four coil waste issues were made from short ends left over after the long printed rotary rolls had been cut into proper coil lengths (such as 500 or 1000 stamps). The excess production occurred in the coil versions of the 1¢ Franklin and 2¢ Washington stamps (Scott #597 and 599). One batch of each issue had been perforated 10 vertically, and those stamps were then perforated 11 horizontally to produce Scott #578 and ; the remaining, smaller group of short ends had not been perforated, and these were finished with gauge 11 perforations on all sides (Scott #594 and 595). Rarest of the four is #594: a 1¢ Franklin stamp.\n\nSeveral extremely rare stamps from this period sometimes misidentified as coil waste were actually produced from the waste printing of sheet stamps. These include another 1¢ Franklin issue (Scott #596) and the perforated 11 rotary press Harding Memorial stamp (Scott #613).\n\n"}
{"id": "3167944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3167944", "title": "Crasis", "text": "Crasis\n\nCrasis (; from the Greek , \"mixing\", \"blending\") is a type of contraction in which two vowels or diphthongs merge into one new vowel or diphthong, making one word out of two. Crasis occurs in Portuguese and Arabic as well as in Ancient Greek, for which it was first described.\n\nIn some cases, like in the French examples below, crasis involves the grammaticalization of two individual lexical items into one, but in other cases, like in the Greek examples, crasis is the orthographic representation of the encliticization and vowel reduction of one grammatical form with another. The difference between the two is that the Greek examples involve two grammatical words and a single phonological word and the French examples involve a single phonological word and grammatical word.\n\nIn both Ancient and Modern Greek, crasis merges a small word and long word closely connected in meaning.\n\nIn Ancient Greek, a coronis ( \"korōnís\" \"curved\"; plural \"korōnídes\") marks the vowel from crasis. In ancient times, it was an apostrophe placed after the vowel (), but it is now written over the vowel , and it is identical to smooth breathing in Unicode. (For instance, uses the character ; \"psili\" means smooth breathing.) Unlike a coronis, smooth breathing never occurs on a vowel in the middle of a word (although it occurs on doubled rho: \"pyrrhos\").\n\nThe article undergoes crasis with nouns and adjectives that start with a vowel:\n\nκαί undergoes crasis with the first-person singular pronoun and produces a long vowel:\n\nIn modern monotonic orthography, the coronis is not written.\n\nIn French, the contractions of determiners are often the results of a vocalisation and a crasis:\n\nThe most frequently observed crasis today is the contraction of the preposition \"a\" (\"to\" or \"at\") with the feminine singular definite article \"a\" (\"the\"), indicated in writing with a grave accent, or the masculine singular definite article \"o\" (also \"the\"). For example, instead of \"*Vou a a praia\" (\"I go to the beach\"), one says \"Vou à praia\" (\"I go to-the beach\"). The contraction turns the clitic \"a\" into the stressed word \"à\". Meanwhile, a person going to a bank, a supermarket or a marketplace would say \"Vou ao banco\", \"Vou ao supermercado\" or \"Vou à feira\", respectively.\n\nCrasis also occurs between the preposition \"a\" and demonstratives: for instance, when the preposition precedes \"aquele(s)\", \"aquela(s)\" (meaning \"that\", \"those\", in different genders), they contract to \"àquele(s)\", \"àquela(s)\". The accent marks a secondary stress in Portuguese.\n\nIn addition, the crasis \"à\" is pronounced lower as than the article or preposition \"a\", as , in the examples in standard European Portuguese, but the qualitative distinction is not made by most speakers in Brazilian Portuguese (some dialects, as Rio de Janeiro's \"fluminense\", are exceptions and make the distinction).\n\nCrasis is very important, as it can change the meaning of a sentence:\n\n\nThese rules determine whether the crasis always apply, or whether one \"may\" use the contraction \"à\" (with an accent) instead of the preposition \"a\" (without an accent):\n\nReplace the preposition \"a\" by another preposition, as \"em\" (\"in\") or \"para\" (\"to\"). If, with replacement, the definite article \"a\" (\"the\") is still possible, crasis applies:\n\n\nIf the nominal complement is changed, after \"a\", from a feminine noun to a masculine noun and it is now necessary to use 'ao' (used naturally by native speakers), crasis applies:\n\n\nThe grave accent is never used before masculine words (nouns, pronouns, etc.); verbs; personal pronouns; numerals, plural nouns without the use of the feminine plural definite article \"as\" (\"the\"); city names that do not use a feminine article; the word \"casa\" (\"house\") if it has the meaning of one's own home;/the word \"terra\" (\"earth\") when it has the meaning of soil; and indefinite, personal, relative or demonstrative pronouns (except the third person and \"aquele(s)\" or \"aquela(s)\"); between identical nouns§ such as \"dia a dia\" \"day by day\", \"everyday\", \"daily life\", \"gota a gota\" \"dropwise\", \"drip\", and \"cara a cara\" \"face to face\"; and after prepositions. Here are exceptions:\n\n\"É preciso declarar guerra à guerra!\" (It is necessary to declare war on war!)\n\n\"É preciso dar mais vida à vida.\" (It is necessary to give more life to life.)\n\nThe grave accent is optional in the following cases:\n\n\n\"Refiro-me [à/a] Fernanda.\" (I am referring to Fernanda.)\n\n\n\"Dirija-se [à/a] sua fazenda.\" (Go to your [own] hacienda.)\n\n\n\"Dirija-se até [à/a] porta.\" (Go by that door.)\n\n\"Eu fui até [à/a] França de carro.\" (I traveled to France by car.)\n\n\n"}

It was created on February 27, 1932. Dnipropetrovsk has a population of about , approximately 80% of whom live centering on administrative center of Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Kamianske, Nikopol. The River Dnieper runs through the oblast.\n\nThe city of Dnipropetrovsk was renamed Dnipro in May 2016 as part of the decommunization laws enacted a year earlier. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was not renamed because it is mentioned as such in the Constitution of Ukraine, and the oblast can only be renamed by a constitutional amendment. In April 2018 a group of over a hundred deputies has formally initiated a proposal in the Ukrainian Parliament to change the name to Sicheslavsk Oblast. The current Dnipro city had the unofficial name \"Sicheslav\" in 1918–21; the name commemorated the Zaporizhian Siches.\n\nThe Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is located in southeastern Ukraine. The area of the oblast (31,974 km²), comprises about 5.3% of the total area of the country. Its longitude from north to south is 130 km, from east to west – 300 km. The oblast borders the Poltava and Kharkiv Oblasts on the north, the Donetsk Oblast on the east, the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson Oblasts on the south, and the Mykolayiv and Kirovohrad Oblasts on the west.\n\nBlack Sea Lowland almost completely within the south oblast, covering half of its territory. In Ternivka located meteorite crater. It is 11 km in diameter and the age is estimated to be 280 ± 10 million years (Permian). The crater is not exposed at the surface. The Dnieper Upland contains a number of minerals including iron, manganese, granite, graphite, brown coal, kaolin etc. Kryvbas is an important economic region, specializing in iron ore mining and the steel industry. It is arguably the main iron ore region of Eastern Europe. Named after the city of Kryvyi Rih, the region occupies the southwestern part of the Dnipropetrovsk, as well as a small neighboring part of the Kirovohrad Oblast.\n\nThe region possesses major deposits of iron ore and some other metallurgical ores. To exploit them, several large mining companies were founded here in the middle of the 20th century. Most of them are located in Kryvyi Rih itself, which is the longest city in Europe.\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, Tatar tribes inhabiting the right bank of the Dnieper were driven away by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, by the mid-15th century, the Nogai (who lived north of the Sea of Azov) and the Crimean Khanate invaded these lands. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate agreed to a border along the Dnieper, and farther east along the Samara River, i.e. through what is today the city of Dnipro. It was in this time that there appeared a new force–the Cossacks, armed freemen not subject to any feudal lord– who were to soon dominate the region . They later became known as Zaporozhian Cossacks, from Zaporizhia–the lands south of Prydniprovye– which translates as \"the Land Beyond the Weirs [Rapids]\"). This was a period of raids and fighting causing considerable devastation and depopulation in that area; the area became known as the 'Wilderness'.\n\nIn 1635, the Polish Government built the Kodak fortress above the Dnieper Rapids at \"Kodaky\", partly as a result of rivalry in the region between Poland, Turkey and the Crimean Khanate, and partly to maintain control over Cossack activity (i.e. to suppress the Cossack raiders and to prevent peasants moving out of the area). On the night of 3 or 4 August 1635, the Cossacks of Ivan Sulyma captured the fort by surprise, burning it down and butchering the garrison of about 200 West European mercenaries under Jean Marion. The fort was rebuilt by French engineer Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan for the Polish Government in 1638, and had a mercenary garrison. \"Kodak\" was captured by Zaporozhian Cossacks on 1 October 1648, and was garrisoned by the Cossacks until its demolition in accordance with the Treaty of the Pruth in 1711.\n\nUnder the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654, the territory became part of the Russian Empire. In 1774 Prince Grigori Potemkin was appointed governor of Novorossiysk Governorate, and after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, he started founding cities in the region and encouraging foreign settlers. The city of \"Yekaterinoslav\" was founded in 1776, not in the current location, but at the confluence of the River Samara with the River Kil'chen' at Loshakivka, north of the Dnieper. On May 8, 1775, after the end of the Russian-Turkish War, Russian authorities opened a postal station and track which linked Kremenchuk, Kinburn foreland and Ochakov, all locations of the Imperial Russian Army.\n\nIn December 1796, Paul I reestablished the Novorossiysk Governorate, mostly with land from the former Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty. In 1802, this province was divided into the Nikolayev Governorate (known as the Kherson Governorate from 1803), Yekaterinoslav Governorate, and the Taurida Governorate. Its capital was the city of Yekaterinoslav (modern Dnipro) created in 1802 out the Yekaterinoslav Vice-regency. It was located within the former lands of Zaporizhian Sich. The government bordered to the north with the Kharkov Governorate and Poltava Governorate, to the west and southwest with the Kherson Governorate, to the south with the Taurida Governorate and Sea of Azov, and to the east with Don Host Oblast.\n\nOlexander Paul discovered and initiated iron ore investigation and production, and this in turn caused the formation of a mining district. In 1874 Alexander II initiated the founding project of a railway, running . This enabled transportation directly to the nearest factories and greatly sped up the development of the region.\n\nOn 1 August 1925, the Yekaterinoslav Governorate administration was discontinued, and in 1926 the city of Yekterinoslav was renamed Dnipropetrovsk in honor of communist leader Grigory Petrovsky. Before the introduction of oblasts in 1932, Ukraine comprised 40 okrugs, which had replaced the former Russian Imperial guberniya (governorate) subdivisions. In 1932 the territory of the Ukrainian SSR was re-established based on oblasts. The first oblasts were Vinnytsia Oblast, Kiev Oblast, Odessa Oblast, Kharkiv Oblast, and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Soon after that in the summer of 1932 Donetsk Oblast was formed out of eastern parts of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nDuring the 1991 referendum, 90.36% of votes in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast were in favor of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 2.2% of the oblast's population supported their region joining Russia, 89.9% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.\n\nThe following data incorporates the number of each type of administrative divisions of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast:\n\n\nThe local administration of the oblast is controlled by the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Rada. The governor of the oblast is the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Rada speaker, appointed by the President of Ukraine.\n\nIts population in 2004 was 3,493,062, which constituted 5.3% of the overall Ukrainian population.\n\nAt the 2001 census, the ethnic groups within the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast were:\n\n\nthe groups by native language:\n\n\nA Pew survey of Dnipropetrovsk residents' religious self-identification showed the following distribution of affiliations: Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) 47.5%, Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate 10.7%, Roman Catholic 1.3%, Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church 0.8%, Protestantism 32.3%.\n\nDnipropetrovsk has one of the most balanced percentage of religious people in the nation mainly due to large number of ethnic groups. The Jewish community is centered in the Dnipro (Golden Rose Synagogue) and Kryvyi Rih area, and emerged during a wave of Jewish immigration.\n\nThere are 20 cities and towns in Dnipropetrovsk. Major population centers today result from historical factors — with the advent of the iron development took place predominantly along the Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro located on River Dnieper. Kryvyi Rih is the base of a large metropolitan area.\n\nRanked by population, the state's 12 largest municipalities are:\n\nThere are 8 over-Dnieper bridges and dozens of grade-separated intersections. Several new intersections are under construction. European route E105 cross Left-bank Dnipro from North to South. Highway M04 (Ukraine) and Highway M18 (Ukraine) cross River Dnieper and Dnipro from West to East, entering Kryvyi Rih. Overall, roads are in poor technical condition and maintained inadequately.\n\nNear-Dnipro Railway (NDZ), headquartered in Dnipro, is a component part of the Ukrzaliznytsia (UZ) company. NDR's route map includes all the railroads in the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhya, Kharkiv, Kherson and Crimea oblasts (provinces of Ukraine).\nAs of 2008, NDR's rail system included 3,275 km (2,035 mi) of track, of which 93,3% were electrified. The PDR consists of five sections (directions), the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhya, Kryvyi Rih, and Crimea directions. There are 244 railway stations in the NDR system. More than a dozens of \"elektrichka\" stops are located within the city allowing residents of different neighborhoods to use the suburban trains.\n\nThe cities of Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih are served by a local sales-tax-funded bus, tram, metro and trolleybus systems.\n\nDnipropetrovsk International Airport is the only international airport in the state and serves as one of the hubs for Dniproavia. The airport has non-stop service to over 20 destinations throughout Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey, as well as to Vienna and Tel Aviv. Kryvyi Rih International Airport provide limited commercial air service.\nThe oblast is situated in the steppe region. Forests in the oblast occupy about 3.9% of the oblast's total territory. The average temperature in the winter balances from −3 to −5 °C and in the summer from 22 to 24 °C. The average annual rainfall is 400–490 mm. During the summer, Dnipropetrovsk oblast is very warm (average day temperature in July is 24 to 28 °C (75 to 82 °F), even hot sometimes 34 to 38 °C (90 to 97 °F). Temperatures as high as 36 °C (97 °F) have been recorded in May. Winter is not so cold (average day temperature in January is −3 to 0 °C (25 to 32 °F), but when there is no snow and the wind blows hard, it feels extremely cold. A mix of snow and rain happens usually in December.\n\nThe tender climate, mineral sources, and the curative mud allow opportunities for rest and cure within the region. Here there are 21 health-centers and medicated pensions, 10 rest homes, recreation departments and rest camps for children.\n\nThe Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has splendid flora and fauna. Here, there are more than 1700 kinds of vegetation, 7500 kinds of animals (including elk, wild boar, dappled deer, roe, hare, fox, wolf, etc.) There are also 114 park and nature objects, including 15 state reserves; 3 nature memorials, 24 local parks; 7 landscape parks; 3 park tracts, which altogether make up approximately 260 square kilometres.\n\n217 rivers flow within the area, including 55 rivers which are longer than 25 km, the major one being the Dnieper, which crosses through the center of the oblast. Also flowing through the region are three major reservoirs, the Kamianske, Dnieper and Kakhovka, and the Dnieper-Kryvyi Rih Canal.\nThe Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has a high industry potential. There are 712 basic industrial organizations, including 20 different types of economic activity with about 473,4 thousand workers. The area also produces about 16.9% of the total industry production of Ukraine. This places the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast second in Ukraine (after the neighbouring Donetsk Oblast).\n\nDnipro is a major industrial centre of Ukraine. It has several facilities devoted to heavy industry that produce a wide range of products, including cast-iron, rolled metal, pipes, machinery, different mining combines, agricultural equipment, tractors, trolleybuses, refrigerators, different chemicals and many others. The most famous and the oldest (founded in the 19th century) is the Metallurgical Plant named after Petrovsky. The city also has big food processing and light industry factories. Many sewing and dress-making factories work for France, Canada, Germany and Great Britain , using the most advanced technologies, materials and design. Dnipro has also dominated in the aerospace industry since the 1950s; construction department Yuzhnoye Design Bureau and Yuzhmash are well known to the specialists all over the world.\n\nYuzhmash is a manufacturer of space rockets, agricultural equipment, buses, trolley buses, trams, wind turbines, and satellites that was inherited from the Soviet Union. It is a large state-owned company located in Dnipro.\n\nDniproavia, an airline, has its head office on the grounds of Dnipropetrovsk International Airport.\nThe region possesses major deposits of iron ore and some other metallurgical ores. To exploit them, several large mining companies were founded here in the middle of the 20th century. Most of them are located in Kryvyi Rih itself, which is the longest city in Europe. Steel companies of the region (except Mittal Steel-owned Kryvorizhstal) are controlled by either the Privat Group or the SCM. From the 1990s until 2004, these once united and state-owned industries went through a hard and scandal-ridden process of privatization. Being a business oligarch entity, Privat Group controls some prominent Ukrainian media, maintains close relations with politicians and sponsors professional sports. Key businesses of the group (including the Privatbank itself) are based in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which is regarded as its \"homeland\". Group's founding owners are natives of Dnipropetrovsk and made their entire career there.\n\nArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, owned by ArcelorMittal since 2005 is the largest private company by revenue in Ukraine, producing over 7 million tonnes of crude steel, and mined over 17 million tonnes of iron ore. As of 2011, the company employed about 37,000 people. 4 Iron Ore Enrichment Works of Metinvest are a large contributors to the UA's balance of payments. The third giant – Evraz mining company.\n\nDnipropetrovsk has several colleges and universities:\n\n\nRegion houses the Ukrainian Premier League football club, FC Dnipro. This club, commonly seen as representing the city at large, holds a record for being the only Soviet team to win the USSR Federation Cup twice; since independence they have gone on to win the Ukrainian Championship once and the Ukrainian League Cup three times. Kryvyi Rih was home to the football team Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih. FC Hirnyk Kryvyi Rih is a club based in Kryvyi Rih. The club currently competes in the Ukrainian First League. It is part of the Sports Club Hirnyk which combines several other sections. The club's owner is the Kryvyi Rih Iron Ore Combine (KZRK), the biggest subterranean mining public company in Ukraine.\nSC Kryvbas is a professional basketball club. Achievements of the team are winning the Ukrainian Basketball League in 2009, and winning the Higher League in 2003 and 2004. Since 2010 the team is active in the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague.\n\nRecently built Dnipro-Arena has a capacity of 31,003 people. The Dnipro-Arena hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification game between Ukraine and England on 10 October 2009. The Dnipro Arena was initially chosen as one of the Ukrainian venues for their joint Euro 2012 bid with Poland. However it was dropped from the list in May 2009 as the capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by UEFA.\n\nDnipropetrovsk has a regional federation within Ukrainian Bandy and Rink bandy Federation.\nHistorically, Dnieper Ukraine comprised territory that roughly corresponded to the area of Ukraine within the expanding Russian Empire. Ukrainians sometimes call it Great Ukraine (Velyka Ukrayina). Historically, this region is tightly entwined with the history of Ukraine and is considered as the heart of the country.\n\nUkrainian (Middle Dnieprian dialect, 67,0%) and Russian (31,9%) language are both equally used officially, with Russian being more common in cities, while Ukrainian is the dominant language in rural communities. These details result in a significant difference across different survey results, as even a small restating of a question switches responses of a significant group of people. The speaking of Surzhyk instead of Russian or Ukrainian is wide and viewed negatively by nationalist language activists. Because it is neither the one nor the other, they regard Surzhyk as a threat to the uniqueness of Ukrainian culture.\n\nPetrykivsky Painting originates from Petrykivka village. The distinctive features of this handicraft are the patterns, unusual technique and white background. It was included to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\n\nThe following historical-cultural sites were nominated to the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.\n\nA Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the Zaporizhian Host and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the Ukrainian State. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of Pyotr Rumyantsev the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.\n\nA Cossack with a rifle was restored by the Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadsky in 1918. However, later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine. In 2002 was adopted flag and identical coat of arms of Oblast, which consists of cossack with musket and nine yellow eight-pointed stars. Stars represent coat of arms of Yekaterinoslav Governorate which also consisted of imperial monogram of Catherine the Great.\n\n\n"}

While the idea may have an approbatory sense of prudence or diplomacy, the phrase is often either used euphemistically to denote dissimulation (misleading by withholding pertinent information) or else used ironically to mean outright lying.\n\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations\" and Kenneth Rose trace the idea to Edmund Burke, the first of whose \"Letters on a Regicide Peace\", written in 1795 and published in 1796, included: \nThe religious sense of \"economy\" was applied to religious truth by John Henry Newman, based on Jesus' injunction not to cast . Newman advocated \"cautious dispensation of the truth, after the manner of a discreet and vigilant steward\" while being \"careful ever to maintain \"substantial\" truth\". Mental reservation is a somewhat related idea also associated with Roman Catholic ethics.\n\nA jocular reference to the basic concept was made by Mark Twain in \"Following the Equator\" in 1897:\nThe precise phrase \"economical with the truth\" is attested from 1897. It was used in the New Zealand House of Representatives in 1923, and the House of Commons of Canada in 1926; \"over-economical with the truth\" was used in the British House of Commons in 1968. The phrase was used somewhat ironically to refer to one of the Gestapo involved in the rounding up and killing of escaped PoW's following The Great Escape from Stalag Luft III in Paul Brickhill's book, \"The Great Escape\", originally published in 1950. Alan Durant of Middlesex University describes the phrase prior to 1986 as having \"extremely restricted currency\" and as a rule used in allusion to either Burke or Twain.\n\n\"Economical with the truth\" became a political catchphrase in the United Kingdom in 1986 during the \"Spycatcher\" trial in the Australian Supreme Court of New South Wales, when Robert Armstrong, the UK Cabinet Secretary, was questioned by Malcolm Turnbull, and described a letter thus:\n\nBob Ellis wrote that the audience had laughed at \"bent untruth\", and that Armstrong expected a laugh for \"economical with the truth\" but got none. Political opponents of the government's actions in the \"Spycatcher\" case derided Armstrong's distinction.\n\nIn 1992, when Alan Clark was questioned at the Old Bailey by Geoffrey Robertson in an Arms-to-Iraq case, he accounted for the discrepancies between his testimony and statements he had made previously. His response became notorious: \n\nAlan Durant was an expert witness in a 1992 libel suit brought by a man who had been described as \"economical with the truth\". The defendant claimed the words did not imply the plaintiff was a liar. Durant, after examining a corpus of uses of the phrase, felt that lying had become the default meaning, but might be over-ridden based on the context. The earlier allusion to Burke or Twain was no longer common. The libel suit was settled out of court.\n\n\n"}

She received the Austrian Grand Decoration of Honour for services to the province of Lower Austria for Science and Art. She co-founded the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society and International Wittgenstein Symposium.\n\nElisabeth Leinfellner studied linguistics at the University of Vienna and University of Munich and worked as a freelance \"copy editor.\" She moved to Lincoln, Nebraska and taught at Doane College in Crete, Nebraska and at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. in 1975, she cofounded the International Wittgenstein Symposium of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society (ALWS).\n\nIn 1986, she returned to Austria and 1990 she obtained habilitation qualification at the Institute of Linguistics of the University of Vienna with a thesis on semantic networks and context. From 1994-1997 she served as president of ALWS and was vice president from 1997 to 2010. She was on the editorial committee of the new publication series of the ALWS and the reports of the ALWS.\n\nShe had visiting professorships at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1992, at the University of Michigan (1997 Max Kade Distinguished Visiting Professor) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the University of Rome II in 1999.\n\nStarting in 1996, she organized for the Indiana University of Pennsylvania - Honors College with the University of Vienna and sponsored students.

She died in a Vienna hospital on January 4, 2010 and her husband Werner followed her in death three months later on April 6, 2010.\n\nAlthough she was trained as a linguist, she had deep interests in philosophical questions. Her research interests were both broad and deep including political language, philosophy of language (especially Fritz Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein), semantic networks and cognitive semantics, political and feminist critique of language, rhetoric and argumentation theory, the application of linguistics to the language of literature, and evolutionary mechanisms of the language development. In particular, she focused on Ludwig Wittgenstein and the philosopher and writer Fritz Mauthner. However, she also published on causality and language, on Habermas’ theory of communicative competence from a linguistic point of view and on William Ockham’s and Franz Brentano’s work on semantics. Her book on euphemism in political language (\"Der Euphemismus in der politischen Sprache\") is particular important. She also drew attention to texts and their meanings as evolutionary systems.\n\nHer research was intertwined with Werner Leinfellner’s and, therefore, it should not come as a surprise that they co-authored publications, most notably a book on ontology, systems theory and semantics (\"Ontologie, Systemtheorie und Semantik\"). This comprehensive book is an original attempt to connect the traditional philosophical field of ontology with a cognitive-recursive semantics. It reflects their broad knowledge in different academic areas as well as their abilities to synthesize ideas. Their book bridges the gap between ordinary language and the language of theories. It demonstrates that both are governed by the same semantic regularities.\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote, translated and published many scholarly works, including books on the tradition, liturgy, music, and history of Syriac Orthodox Church.\n\nHe was born in Mosul, Ottoman Empire, and attended a school run by Dominican monks. He studied French and Turkish as well as religious literature and history, and later learned Arabic from studies under Muslim scholars. At the Deir al-Za`faran monastery in Mardin, Turkey, where he started his theological training in 1905, he studied the Syriac language and literature.\n\nAfter his ordination as a priest in 1908, he remained at the monastery to teach, and in 1911 he assumed the additional responsibility of managing the monastery press. Later that year he began a scholar's visit to the monasteries and churches of Mesopotamia and Turkey. Soon after his return in 1913 he made a similar trip to examine Syriac manuscripts in the great libraries of Europe.\n\nOn May 20, 1918, Patriarch Ignatius Elias III consecrated Aphrem as metropolitan Mor Severius and named him the bishop of Syria. Rev. Joel E. Werda led the Assyrian delegation from the USA, representing the Diaspora community in Paris Peace Conference, 1919. He accompanied Bishop Aphrem Barsoum and his secretary. He was disillusioned, however, by the atmosphere of self-interest which prevailed among the delegates representing the European powers, and at one stage of the conference found himself defending not only the rights of the Assyrians, but those of the Arab nations. Though Mor Severius did not succeed in protecting the Assyrian's interests at Paris, the journey gave him ample opportunity for further study of Syriac literature before his return in May, 1920. Two years later, the League of Nations' action making Syria a French mandate brought him the new responsibility of providing for refugees from Cilicia, and he also undertook the building of many new churches in and near Aleppo.\n\nAnother journey took Mor Severius to Geneva and Lausanne as an apostolic delegate to the World Conference on Faith and Order (August 3–21, 1927). Soon afterwards he came as an emissary of the Patriarch to the United States, where he investigated the condition of the Syriac Orthodox Church, consecrated three new churches, and ordained new priests. He also gave lectures on the Syriac language and literature at the Providence University and the University of Chicago, and served at the Oriental Institute of the latter institution until his return in 1929.\n\nAfter the death of Patriarch Ignatius Elias III in 1932, the Synod of Bishops named Mor Severius his acting successor. On January 30, 1933, he was formally elected Patriarch of Antioch, assuming the ecclesiastical name of Mor Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum. The new Patriarch quickly showed himself as an active Church head, establishing new dioceses and founding a theological seminary at Zahla, Lebanon (later moved to Mosul, and then to Beirut). In the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the political situation in the new state of Turkey, where Deir al-Za`faran, the seat of the Patriarchate, was located, Mor Aphrem was forced to relocate the Patriarchate to Homs in Syria. The great Patriarch died on June 23, 1957 and was buried in Homs.\n\nDespite the numerous responsibilities of his work in the Church and frequent interruptions for travel, the Patriarch devoted much of his time to writing.\n\nPatriarch Aphrem produced many other works which have never been published. His Syriac-Arabic lexicon and his compendium of church history in the 20th century are written in both Syriac and Arabic. His history of Tur Abdin, in Syriac, was translated into Arabic by Bishop Bahnam. In Arabic, he also wrote a history of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch and the famous men of the Syriac Orthodox Church, a history of Syriac Orthodox Church dioceses, an index of Syriac manuscripts, and translations of ten liturgies of the Syriac Christianity. Also, he translated into Arabic the second part of the Ecclesiastical History of Bar `Ebroyo in 1909 when he was a monk at the Monastery of Za`faran.\n\nThe Scattered Pearls: history of Syriac literature and sciences () is a survey of Syriac literature; the review was written in the 1920s by Barsoum. The book was translated to several languages, the English by Matti Musa in 2003 (Gorgias Press ).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2707059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2707059", "title": "Impervious surface", "text": "Impervious surface\n\nImpervious surfaces are mainly artificial structures—such as pavements (roads, sidewalks, driveways and parking lots, as well as industrial areas such as airports, ports and logistics and distribution centres, all of which use considerable paved areas) that are covered by impenetrable materials such as asphalt, concrete, brick, stone—and rooftops. Soils compacted by urban development are also highly impervious.\n\nImpervious surfaces are an environmental concern because, with their construction, a chain of events is initiated that modifies urban air and water resources:\n\n\nThe total coverage by impervious surfaces in an area, such as a municipality or a watershed is usually expressed as a percentage of the total land area. The coverage increases with rising urbanization. In rural areas, impervious cover may only be one or two percent. In residential areas, coverage increases from about 10 percent in low-density subdivisions to over 50 percent in multi-family communities. In industrial and commercial areas, coverage rises above 70 percent. In regional shopping centers and dense urban areas, it is over 90 percent. In the contiguous 48 states of the USA, urban impervious cover adds up to 43,000 square miles (110,000 km²) — an area nearly the size of the State of Ohio. Continuing development adds another quarter of a million acres (1,000 km²) each year. Typically two-thirds of the cover is pavements and one-third is building roofs.\n\nImpervious surface coverage can be limited by restricting land use density (such as number of homes per acre in a subdivision), but this approach causes land elsewhere (outside the subdivision) to be developed, to accommodate growing population. (See \"urban sprawl.\") Alternatively, urban structures can be built differently to make them function more like naturally pervious soils; examples of such alternative structures are porous pavements, green roofs and infiltration basins.\n\nRainwater from impervious surfaces can be collected in rainwater tanks and used in place of main water.\n\nPartly in response to recent criticism by municipalities, a number of concrete manufacturers such as CEMEX and Quikrete have begun producing permeable materials which partly mitigate the environmental impact of conventional impervious concrete. These new materials are composed of various combinations of naturally derived solids including fine to coarse-grained rocks and minerals, organic matter (including living organisms), ice, weathered rock and precipitates, liquids primarily water solutions, and gases.\nThe percentage imperviousness, often referred to as PIMP in calculations, is an important factor when considering drainage of water. It is calculated by measuring the percentage of a catchment area which is made up of impervious surfaces such as roads, roofs and other paved surfaces. An estimation of PIMP is given by PIMP = 6.4J^0.5 where J is the number of dwellings per hectare (Butler and Davies 2000). For example, woodland has a PIMP value of 10%, whereas dense commercial areas have a PIMP value of 100%. This variable is used in the Flood Estimation Handbook.\nHomer and others (2007) indicate that about 76 percent of the conterminous United States is classified as having less than 1 percent impervious cover, 11 percent with impervious cover of 1 to 10 percent, 4 percent with an estimated impervious cover of 11 to 20 percent, 4.4 percent with an estimated impervious cover of 21 to 40 percent, and about 4.4 percent with an estimated impervious cover greater than 40 percent.\n\nThe total impervious area (TIA) can be expressed as a fraction (from zero to one) or a percentage. There are many methods for estimating TIA, including the use of the National Land Cover Data Set (NLCD) with a Geographic information system, land-use categories with categorical TIA estimates, a generalized percent developed area, and relations between population density and TIA.\n\nThe U.S. NLCD impervious surface data set may provide a high-quality nationally-consistent land cover data set in a GIS-ready format that can be used to estimate TIA value. The NLCD consistently quantifies the percent anthropogenic TIA for the NLCD at a 30-meter (a 900 m2) pixel resolution throughout the Nation. Within the data set, each pixel is quantified as having a TIA value that ranges from 0 to 100 percent. TIA estimates made with the NLCD impervious surface data set represent an aggregated TIA value for each pixel rather than a TIA value for an individual impervious feature. For example, a two lane road in a grassy field has a TIA value of 100 percent, but the pixel containing the road would have a TIA value of 26 percent. If the road (equally) straddles the boundary of two pixels, each pixel would have a TIA value of 13 percent. The Data-quality analysis of the NLCD 2001 data set with manually delimited TIA sample areas indicates that the average error of predicted versus actual TIA may range from 8.8 to 11.4 percent.\n\nTIA estimates from land use are made by identifying land use categories for large blocks of land, summing the total area of each category, and multiplying each area by a characteristic TIA coefficient. Land use categories commonly are used to estimate TIA because areas with a common land use can be identified from field studies, from maps, from planning and zoning information, and from remote imagery. Land use coefficient methods commonly are used because planning and zoning maps that identify similar areas are, increasingly, available in GIS formats. Also, land use methods are selected to estimate potential effects of future development on TIA with planning maps that quantify projected changes in land use. There are substantial differences in actual and estimated TIA estimates from different studies in the literature. Terms like low density and high density may differ in different areas. A residential density of one-half acre per house may be classified as high density in a rural area, medium density in a suburban area, and low density in an urban area. Granato (2010) provides a table with TIA values for different land-use categories from 30 studies in the literature.\n\nThe percent developed area (PDA) is commonly used to estimate TIA manually by using maps. The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLCC) defines a developed area as being covered by at least 30 percent of constructed materials). Southard (1986) defined non-developed areas as natural, agricultural, or scattered residential development. He developed a regression equation to predict TIA using percent developed area (table 6-1). He developed his equation using logarithmic power function with data from 23 basins in Missouri. He noted that this method was advantageous because large basins could quickly be delineated and TIA estimated manually from available maps. Granato (2010) developed a regression equation by using data from 262 stream basins in 10 metropolitan areas of the conterminous United States with drainage areas ranging from 0.35 to 216 square miles and PDA values ranging from 0.16 to 99.06 percent.\nTIA also is estimated from population density data by estimating the population in an area of interest and using regression equations to calculate the associated TIA. Population-density data are used because nationally consistent census-block data are available in GIS formats for the entire United States. Population-density methods also can be used for predicting potential effects of future development. Although there may be substantial variation in relations between population density and TIA the accuracy of such estimates tend to improve with increasing drainage area as local variations are averaged out. Granato (2010) provides a table with 8 population-density relations from the literature and a new equation developed by using data from 6,255 stream basins in the USGS GAGESII dataset. Granato (2010) also provides four equations to estimate TIA from housing density, which is related to population density.\n\nNatural impervious areas are defined herein as land covers that can contribute a substantial amount of stormflow during small and large storms, but commonly are classified as pervious areas. These areas are not commonly considered as an important source of stormflow in most highway and urban runoff-quality studies, but may produce a substantial amount of stormflow. These natural impervious areas may include open water, wetlands, rock outcrops, barren ground (natural soils with low imperviousness), and areas of compacted soils. Natural impervious areas, depending on their nature and antecedent conditions, may produce stormflow from infiltration excess overland flow, saturation overland flow, or direct precipitation. The effects of natural impervious areas on runoff generation are expected to be more important in areas with low TIA than highly developed areas. \n\nThe NLCD provides land-cover statistics that can be used as a qualitative measure of the prevalence of different land covers that may act as natural impervious areas. Open water may act as a natural impervious area if direct precipitation is routed through the channel network and arrives as stormflow at the site of interest. Wetlands may act as a natural impervious area during storms when groundwater discharge and saturation overland flow are a substantial proportion of stormflow. Barren ground in riparian areas may act as a natural impervious area during storms because these areas are a source of infiltration excess overland flows. Seemingly pervious areas that have been affected by development activities may act as\nimpervious areas and generate infiltration excess overland flows. These stormflows may occur even during storms that do not meet precipitation volume or intensity criteria to produce runoff based on nominal infiltration rates. \n\nDeveloped pervious areas may behave like impervious areas because development and subsequent use tends to compact soils and reduce infiltration rates. For example, Felton and Lull (1963) measured infiltration rates for forest soils and lawns to indicate a potential 80 percent reduction in infiltration as a result of development activities. Similarly, Taylor (1982) did infiltrometer tests in areas before and after suburban development and noted that topsoil alteration and compaction by construction activities reduced infiltration rates by more than 77 percent.\n\n\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Geological Survey and the Federal Highway Administration.\n"}

{"id": "2111097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111097", "title": "Japanese Sign Language", "text": "Japanese Sign Language\n\n, also known by the acronym JSL, is the dominant sign language in Japan.\n\nLittle is known about sign language and the deaf community before the Edo period. In 1862, the Tokugawa shogunate dispatched envoys to various European schools for the deaf but the first school for the deaf was not established until 1878 in Kyōto.\n\nUntil 1948, deaf children were not required to attend school or to receive a formal education.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, a subtle cultural change in views about the Deaf in Japan evolved. The long-standing concept that \"deaf\" only means \"people who can't hear\" emphasized a physical impairment as part of a biomedical disease model; however, this was gradually replaced by a slightly different paradigm. \"Deaf people\" were more often identified as \"people who use Japanese sign language\". In other words, the biomedical disability model began slowly to be displaced by a social-cultural or JSL paradigm.\n\nThe Japanese Federation of the Deaf has worked with slow success in efforts to enhance communication opportunities for Japanese whose primary language is JSL.\n\nThe changing status of JSL and the Deaf in Japan is a slow process; but there are highlights. For example, JSL has an advocate among the Imperial family. Kiko, Princess Akishino has studied JSL and is a trained sign language interpreter. She attends the Sign Language Speech Contest for High School Students held every August, and Praising Mothers Raising Children with Hearing Impairments every December. In October 2008, she participated in the 38th National Deaf Women's Conference. She also signs in informal Deaf gatherings.\n\nThe Deaf community supported passage of the proposed Sign Language Law. The \"Basic Act for Persons with Disabilities\" was enacted in 2011. This law recognized sign language as a language.\n\nThe slow integration of JSL within the context of Japanese culture has been accompanied by an expansion of the numbers of sign language interpreters:\n\n\nIn 2006, the Japanese government amended the Supporting Independence of People with Disabilities Act. The new language in the law encourages local governments to increase the number and use of JSL interpreters.\n\nAs in other sign languages, JSL (usually called simply 手話 \"shuwa\", \"hand talk\") consists of words, or signs, and the grammar with which they are put together. JSL signs may be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or any other part of a sentence, including suffixes indicating tense, negation, and grammatical particles. Signs consist not just of a manual gesture, but also (pronouncing a standard Japanese word with or without making a sound). The same sign may assume one of two different but semantically related meanings, as for example in \"home\" and \"house\", according to its mouthing. Another indispensable part of many signs is facial expression.\nIn addition to signs and their grammar, JSL is augmented by , a form of fingerspelling, which was introduced from the United States in the early part of the twentieth century, but is used less often than in American Sign Language. Each \"yubimoji\" corresponds to a \"kana\", as illustrated by the JSL syllabary. Fingerspelling is used mostly for foreign words, last names, and unusual words. is used to cover situations where existing signs are not sufficient.\n\nBecause, like the standard Japanese from which it partly derives, JSL is strongly influenced by the complex Japanese writing system, it dedicates particular attention to the written language and includes elements specifically designed to express \"kanji\" in signs. For either conciseness or disambiguation, particular signs are associated with certain commonly used \"kanji\", place names, and sometimes surnames. (tracing \"kanji\" in the air) is also sometimes used for last names or place names, just as it is in spoken Japanese.\n\nBesides JSL there are also Pidgin Signed Japanese and Signed Japanese. Both of these are signed forms of the Japanese language. The first is used between non-native signers, and the latter is sometimes used in schools for the deaf. However, up to 2002, most Japanese schools for the deaf emphasized oral education, i.e. teaching through lip-reading. Even now, at least officially, JSL is not taught. It has been only a decade since the official school ban on the use of JSL was lifted.\n\nThe sign languages of Korea and Taiwan share some signs with JSL, perhaps due to cultural transfer during the period of Japanese occupation. JSL has about a 60% lexical similarity with Taiwanese Sign Language.\n\nInterest in sign language among the hearing population of Japan has been increasing, with numerous books now published targeting the hearing population, a weekly TV program teaching JSL, and the increasing availability of night school classes for the hearing to learn JSL. There have been several TV dramas, including \"Hoshi no Kinka\" (1995), in which signing has been a significant part of the plot, and sign language dramas are now a minor genre on Japanese TV.\n\nThe highly acclaimed 2006 Alejandro González Iñárritu–directed multiple Academy Award–nominated film \"Babel\" also featured JSL as a significant element of the plot. Hearing actress Rinko Kikuchi received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her signing role in this film.\n\nIn Japan, about 40,000 signatures including both the hearing and deaf people have been collected to subtitle the scene in Babel spoken in Japanese for the deaf audience.\n\nThe anime school drama film \"A Silent Voice\" (Japanese: 聲の形 Hepburn: Koe no Katachi, lit. \"The Shape of Voice\"), released in 2016, features a prominent deaf JSL-speaking character, Shōko Nishimiya. It was produced by Kyoto Animation, directed by Naoko Yamada, written by Reiko Yoshida, and featured character designs by Futoshi Nishiya. It is based on the manga of the same name written and illustrated by Yoshitoki Ōima. The film premiered in Japan on September 17, 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40316", "title": "Kurdish languages", "text": "Kurdish languages\n\nKurdish (, کوردی; ) is a continuum of Northwestern Iranian languages spoken by the Kurds in Western Asia. Kurdish forms three dialect groups known as Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji), Central Kurdish (Sorani), and Southern Kurdish (Palewani). A separate group of non-Kurdish Northwestern Iranian languages, the Zaza–Gorani languages, are also spoken by several million Kurds. Studies as of 2009 estimate between 8 and 20 million native Kurdish speakers in Turkey. The majority of the Kurds speak Northern Kurdish (\"Kurmanji\").\n\nThe literary output in Kurdish was mostly confined to poetry until the early 20th century, when more general literature began to be developed. Today, there are two principal written Kurdish dialects, namely Northern Kurdish in the northern parts of the geographical region of Kurdistan and Central Kurdish further east and south. Central Kurdish is, along with Arabic, one of the two official languages of Iraq and is in political documents simply referred to as \"Kurdish\".\n\nThe Kurdish languages belong to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European family. They are generally classified as Northwestern Iranian languages, or by some scholars as intermediate between Northwestern and Southwestern Iranian. Martin van Bruinessen notes that \"Kurdish has a strong south-western Iranian element\", whereas \"Zaza and Gurani [...] do belong to the north-west Iranian group\".\n\nLudwig Paul concludes that Kurdish seems to be a Northwestern Iranian language in origin, but acknowledges that it shares many traits with Southwestern Iranian languages like Persian, apparently due to longstanding and intense historical contacts.\n\nWindfuhr identified Kurdish dialects as Parthian, albeit with a Median substratum. Windfuhr and Frye assume an eastern origin for Kurdish and consider it as related to eastern and central Iranian dialects.\n\nThe present state of knowledge about Kurdish allows, at least roughly, drawing the approximate borders of the areas where the main ethnic core of the speakers of the contemporary Kurdish dialects was formed. The most argued hypothesis on the localisation of the ethnic territory of the Kurds remains D.N. Mackenzie's theory, proposed in the early 1960s (Mackenzie 1961). Developing the ideas of P. Tedesco (1921: 255) and regarding the common phonetic isoglosses shared by Kurdish, Persian, and Baluchi, Mackenzie concluded that the speakers of these three languages may once have been in closer contact.\n\nHe has tried to reconstruct the alleged Persian-Kurdish-Baluchi linguistic unity presumably in the central parts of Iran. According to Mackenzie's theory, the Persians (or Proto-Persians) occupied the province of Fars in the southwest (proceeding from the assumption that the Achaemenids spoke Persian), the Baluchis (Proto-Baluchis) inhabited the central areas of Western Iran, and the Kurds (Proto-Kurds), in the wording of G. Windfuhr (1975: 459), lived either in northwestern Luristan or in the province of Isfahan.\n\nKurdish is divided into three groups, where dialects from different groups are not mutually intelligible without acquired bilingualism.\n\nIn historical evolution terms, Kurmanji is less modified than Sorani and Pehlewani in both phonetic and morphological structure. The Sorani group has been influenced by among other things its closer cultural proximity to the other languages spoken by Kurds in the region including the Gorani language in parts of Iranian Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kermanshahi group has been influenced by among other things its closer cultural proximity to Persian.\n\nPhilip G. Kreyenbroek, an expert writing in 1992, says:\n\nAccording to \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\", although Kurdish is not a unified language, its many dialects are interrelated and at the same time distinguishable from other Western Iranian languages. The same source classifies different Kurdish dialects as two main groups, northern and central. The reality is that the average Kurmanji speaker does not find it easy to communicate with the inhabitants of Sulaymaniyah or Halabja.\n\nSome linguistic scholars assert that the term \"Kurdish\" has been applied extrinsically in describing the language the Kurds speak, whereas ethnic Kurds have used the word term to simply describe their ethnic or national identity and refer to their language as \"Kurmanji\", \"Sorani\", \"Hewrami\", \"Kermanshahi\", \"Kalhori\" or whatever other dialect or language they speak. Some historians have noted that it is only recently that the Kurds who speak the Sorani dialect have begun referring to their language as \"Kurdî\", in addition to their identity, which is translated to simply mean Kurdish.\n\nMokriani dialect of Central Kurdish is widely spoken in Mokrian. Piranshahr and Mahabad are two principal cities of the Mokrian dialect area.\n\nZaza–Gorani languages, which are spoken by communities in the wider area who identify as ethnic Kurds, are not linguistically classified as Kurdish. Zaza-Gorani is classified as adjunct to Kurdish, although authorities differ in the details. Windfuhr 2009 groups Kurdish with Zaza Gorani within a \"Northwestern I\" group, while Glottolog based on \"Encyclopædia Iranica\"\nprefers an areal grouping of \"Central dialects\" (or \"Kermanic\") within Northwest Iranic, with Kurdish but not Zaza-Gorani grouped with \"Kermanic\".\n\nGorani is distinct from Northern and Central Kurdish, yet shares vocabulary with both of them and there are some grammatical similarities with Central Kurdish. The Hawrami dialects of Gorani includes a variety that was an important literary language since the 14th century, but it was replaced by Central Kurdish in the 20th century.\n\nEuropean scholars have maintained that Gorani is separate from Kurdish and that Kurdish is synonymous with the Northern Kurdish group, whereas ethnic Kurds maintain that Kurdish encompasses any of the unique languages or dialects spoken by Kurds that are not spoken by neighbouring ethnic groups.\n\nGorani is classified as part of the Zaza–Gorani branch of Indo-Iranian languages. The Zaza language, spoken in the northernmost parts of Kurdistan, differs both grammatically and in vocabulary and is generally not understandable by Gorani speakers but it is considered related to Gorani. Almost all Zaza-speaking communities, as well as speakers of the closely related Shabaki dialect spoken in parts of Iraqi Kurdistan, identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.\n\nGeoffrey Haig and Ergin Öpengin in their recent study suggest grouping the Kurdish languages into Northern Kurdish, Central Kurdish, Southern Kurdish, Zaza, and Gorani, and avoid the subgrouping Zaza–Gorani.\n\nThe notable professor Zare Yusupova, has carried out a lot of work and research into the Gorani dialect (as well as many other minority/ancient Kurdish dialects).\n\nDuring his stay in Damascus, historian Ibn Wahshiyya came across two books on agriculture written in Kurdish, one on the culture of the vine and the palm tree, and the other on water and the means of finding it out in unknown ground. He translated both from Kurdish into Arabic in the early 9th century AD.\n\nAmong the earliest Kurdish religious texts is the \"Yazidi Black Book\", the sacred book of Yazidi faith. It is considered to have been authored sometime in the 13th century AD by \"Hassan bin Adi\" (b. 1195 AD), the great-grandnephew of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir (d. 1162), the founder of the faith. It contains the Yazidi account of the creation of the world, the origin of man, the story of Adam and Eve and the major prohibitions of the faith. From the 15th to 17th centuries, classical Kurdish poets and writers developed a literary language. The most notable classical Kurdish poets from this period were Ali Hariri, Ahmad Khani, Malaye Jaziri and Faqi Tayran.\n\nThe Italian priest Maurizio Garzoni published the first Kurdish grammar titled \"Grammatica e Vocabolario della Lingua Kurda\" in Rome in 1787 after eighteen years of missionary work among the Kurds of Amadiya.\nThis work is very important in Kurdish history as it is the first acknowledgment of the widespread use of a distinctive Kurdish language. Garzoni was given the title \"Father of Kurdology\" by later scholars. The Kurdish language was banned in a large portion of Kurdistan for some time. After the 1980 Turkish coup d'état until 1991 the use of the Kurdish language was illegal in Turkey.\n\nToday, Central Kurdish is an official language in Iraq. In Syria, on the other hand, publishing materials in Kurdish is forbidden, though this prohibition is not enforced any more due to the civil war.\n\nBefore August 2002, the Turkish government placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, prohibiting the language in education and broadcast media. The Kurdish alphabet is not recognized in Turkey, and prior to 2013 the use of Kurdish names containing the letters \"X\", \"W\", and \"Q\", which do not exist in the Turkish alphabet, was not allowed. In 2012, Kurdish-language lessons became an elective subject in public schools. Previously, Kurdish education had only been possible in private institutions.\n\nIn Iran, though it is used in some local media and newspapers, it is not used in public schools. In 2005, 80 Iranian Kurds took part in an experiment and gained scholarships to study in Kurdish in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nIn March 2006, Turkey allowed private television channels to begin airing programming in Kurdish. However, the Turkish government said that they must avoid showing children's cartoons, or educational programs that teach Kurdish, and could broadcast only for 45 minutes a day or four hours a week. However, most of these restrictions on private Kurdish television channels were relaxed in September 2009.\n\nIn 2010, Kurdish municipalities in the southeast decided to begin printing water bills, marriage certificates and construction and road signs, as well as emergency, social and cultural notices in Kurdish alongside Turkish. Friday sermons by imams began to be delivered in the language, and Esnaf provided Kurdish price tags.\n\nThe state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) started its 24-hour Kurdish television station on 1 January 2009 with the motto \"we live under the same sky\". The Turkish Prime Minister sent a video message in Kurdish to the opening ceremony, which was attended by Minister of Culture and other state officials. The channel uses the \"X\", \"W\", and \"Q\" letters during broadcasting.\n\nIn Kyrgyzstan, 96.4% of the Kurdish population speak Kurdish as their native language. In Kazakhstan, the corresponding percentage is 88.7%.\n\nBecause Kurdish is an Indo-European language, there are many words that are cognates in Kurdish and other Indo-European languages such as Avestan, Persian, Sanskrit, German, English, Norwegian, Latin and Greek. (Source: \"Altiranisches Wörterbuch (1904)\" for the first two and last six.)\n\nThe bulk of the vocabulary in Kurdish is of Iranian origin, especially of northwestern Iranian. A considerable number of loanwords come from Semitic, mainly Arabic, which entered through Islam and historical relations with Arab tribes. Yet, a smaller group of loanwords which are of Armenian, Caucasian, and Turkic origins are used in Kurdish, besides some European words. There are also Kurdish words with no clear etymology, some of which may be substratal remnants of ancient languages once spoken in the area, such as Hurrian.\n\nThe Kurdish language has been written using four different writing systems. In Iraq and Iran it is written using an Arabic script, composed by Sa'id Kaban Sedqi. More recently, it is sometimes written with a Latin alphabet in Iraq. In Turkey, Syria, and Armenia, it is now written using a Latin script. Kurdish was also written in the Arabic script in Turkey and Syria until 1932. There is a proposal for a unified international recognized Kurdish alphabet based on ISO-8859-1 called \"Yekgirtú\". Kurdish in the former USSR is written with a Cyrillic alphabet. Kurdish has even been written in the Armenian alphabet in Soviet Armenia and in the Ottoman Empire (a translation of the Gospels in 1857 and of all New Testament in 1872).\n\n\n"}

He is known by the acronym the Ramak ().\n\nAfter the Medieval flourishing of Kabbalah, centered on the Zohar, attempts were made to give a complete intellectual system to its theology, such as by Meir ibn Gabbai. Influenced by the earlier success of Jewish philosophy in articulating a rational study of Jewish thought, Moshe Cordovero produced the first full integration of the previous differing schools in Kabbalistic interpretation. While he was a mystic inspired by the opaque imagery of the Zohar, \"Cordoverian Kabbalah\" utilised the conceptual framework of evolving cause and effect from the Infinite to the Finite in systemising Kabbalah, the method of philosophical style discourse he held most effective in describing a process that reflects sequential logic and coherence. His encyclopedic works became a central stage in the development of Kabbalah.\n\nImmediately after him in Safed, Isaac Luria articulated a subsequent system of Kabbalistic theology, with new supra-rational doctrines recasting previous Kabbalistic thought. While Lurianism displaced the Cordoverian scheme and became predominant in Judaism, its followers read Cordoverian works in harmony with their teachings. Where to them, Lurianism described the \"World\" of Rectification, Cordovero described the pre-Rectification World. Both articulations of the 16th century mystical Renaissance in Safed gave Kabbalah an intellectual prominence to rival Medieval Rationalism, whose social influence on Judaism had waned after the Expulsion from Spain.\n\nThe name Cordovero indicates that his family originated in Córdoba, Spain and perhaps fled from there during the expulsion of 1492 during the Spanish Inquisition. His Hebrew signature, however (Cordoeiro), strongly suggests a long-lasting residence in Portugal.\n\nThe \"Ramak\" was either born in, or moved to Safed in the Land of Israel, the city that was soon to become famed as a center of Kabbalah and mystical creativity. Albeit not involved in mystical studies until his twentieth year, RaMaK soon after gained a reputation of an extraordinary genius and a prolific writer. Besides his knowledge in Kabbalah, he was a Talmudic scholar and a man of commanding mastery in Jewish philosophical thought who was respected in these fields. Contrary to popular belief, however, Ramak was not one of the rabbis who received the special semicha (\"ordination\") from Rabbi Jacob Berab in 1538, alongside Rabbi Yosef Karo (Cordovero's teacher in Halakha), Rabbi Moshe of Trani, Rabbi Yosef Sagis, and Rabbi Moshe Alshich. As a whole, Ramak's contributions to posterity were in speculative and performative Kabballah, but during his lifetime he was the renowned head of the Yeshiva for Portuguese immigrants in Safed.\n\nAccording to his own testimony in the introduction to \"Pardes Rimonim\", in 1542, at the age of twenty, Ramak heard a \"Heavenly voice\" urging him to study Kabbalah with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz, composer of the mystical song Lecha Dodi. He was thus initiated into the mysteries of the Zohar. The young Ramak not only mastered the text, but decided to organize the Kabbalistic themes leading to his day and present them in an organized fashion. This led to the composition of his first book, \"Pardes Rimonim\" (\"Orchard of Pomegranates\"), which was completed in 1548 and secured Ramak's reputation as a brilliant Kabbalist and a lucid thinker. The \"Pardes\", as it is known, was a systemization of all Kabbalistic thought up to that time and featured the author's attempt at a reconciliation of various early schools with the conceptual teachings of the Zohar in order to demonstrate an essential unity and self-consistent philosophical basis of Kabbalah.\n\nHis second work - a magnum opus titled \"Ohr Yakar\" (\"Precious Light\") - was a 16 volume commentary on the Zoharic literature in its entirety and a work to which Ramak had devoted most of his life (the modern publication of this great work has started during the mid 1960s and reached partial fruition in 2004 Jerusalem, though the 23-volume set left out about two-thirds of the Tikkunei Zohar; additional volumes are still being published). Some parts of Ohr Yakar have been published under separate titles, such as Shiur Qomah, Tefilah le-Moshe etc.\n\nSome other books for which the Ramak is known are \"Tomer Devorah\" (\"Palm Tree of Deborah\"), in which he utilizes the Kabbalistic concepts of the Sephirot (\"Divine attributes\") to illuminate a system of morals and ethics; \"Ohr Neerav\", a justification of and insistence upon the importance of Kabbalah study and an introduction to the methods explicated in Pardes Rimonim; \"Elimah Rabbati\", a highly abstract treatise on kabbalistic concerns revolving around the Godhead and His relationship to the Sefirot; and \"Sefer Gerushin\", a short and intimate composition which features the highly devotional slant of Ramak, as well as his asceticism and religious piety. Certain parts of Ramak's works are still in form of manuscripts, whereas his existing writings suggest many other compositions which he either intended to write or had actually written - but were lost.\n\nAround 1550, the Ramak founded a Kabbalah academy in Safed (then in Ottoman Syria), which he led for twenty or so years, until his death. According to Jewish legend, it was reported that the prophet Elijah revealed himself to him. Among his disciples were many of the luminaries of Safed, including Rabbi Eliyahu de Vidas, author of Reshit Chochmah (\"Beginning of Wisdom\"), and Rabbi Chaim Vital, who later became the official recorder and disseminator of the teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria.\n\nRamak was survived by a wife whose name remains unknown (it is known that she was Solomon Alkabetz' sister) and by a son named Gedaliah (1562–1625). Gedaliah was the impetus behind the publication of some of Ramak's books in Venice, Italy c. 1584-7. Gedaliah was buried in Jerusalem, where he had spent most of his adult life after returning from Venice.\n\nAccording to tradition, Isaac Luria (known by the acronym \"Ari\" or \"Arizal\") arrived in Safed on the exact day of the funeral of Moshe Cordovero in 1570. When he joined in the funeral procession, he realised that only he saw a pillar of fire following the Ramak's presence. The Zohar describes this spiritual revelation as a sign to the individual who sees it, that he is meant to inherit the succession of leadership from the departed person. However, as Luria had been instructed to find his chosen disciple in Safed, Haim Vital, to reveal his new teachings to, he avoided accepting Kabbalistic leadership until six months later, when Rabbi Haim Vital approached him. The Ari only lived for two years after this, until 1572, but in those few months he revolutionised the conceptual system of Kabbalah, with his new doctrines and philosophical system.\n\nThe two schools of Cordoveran and Lurianic Kabbalah give two alternative accounts and synthesis of the complete theology of Kabbalah until then, based on their interpretation of the Zohar. After the public dissemination of the Zohar in Medieval times, various attempts were made to give a complete intellectual system of theology to its different schools and interpretations. Influenced by the earlier rational success of Jewish philosophy, especially the work of Maimonides, in producing a systematic intellectual articulation of Judaism, the Ramak achieved the first accepted systemisation of Kabbalah, based on its rational categorisation and study. Subsequent followers of the Ari saw their teachings as harmonious with, and a deeper interpretation of the Zohar and the Ramak's system, but the new system of Isaac Luria revealed completely new doctrines, as well as new descriptions of the earlier ideas of Kabbalah. In time, Lurianic Kabbalah emerged as the dominant system; however, the works of the Ramak are still highly esteemed and widely studied, as well.\n\n\n"}

He is also a writer. he is overseeing a large-scale encyclopaedia project on Indian epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana which will be released around 2015. Due to the difficulty and complexity of the undertaking, it took Bhaduri a decade to conceptualise the project. Indian news article writers stated that encyclopaedia was poised to challenge many long-held beliefs about the epics.\n\nNrisingha Prasad Bhaduri was born on 23 November 1950 at village Gopalpur in Pabna (now in Bangladesh). He earned a Master of Arts degree in Sanskrit language from University of Calcutta. He was a reader of Sanskrit at Gurudas College, Kolkata. He retired from his job on 30 November 2010.\n\nBhaduri is noted for his scholarly but simple interpretations of ancient Indian tales, particularly those appearing in the Indian epics, the \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\". He generally writes in Bengali and has written books like \"Balmikir Ram O Ramayan\", \"Arjun o Draupadi\", \"Krishna, Kunti Ebong Kaunteyo\", and others. For many years he has been writing essays on Hindu epic characters in Bengali magazines (specially \"Sarodiya\" issues of Bartaman and Ananda Publishers books like \"Anandamela\", \"Desh\") etc. In his book \"Dandaniti\" Bhaduri has dealt with the idea of politics in ancient and mediaeval India. Bhaduri's regular column \"Katha Amrita Saman \"published in Sangbad Pratidin's Sunday supplement issue\" Robbar \"which formerly edited by Rituparno Ghosh.\n\nKrishna has been a special interest of Bhaduri. He has written multiple books and essays on the character. In the book \"Mahabharater Bharat Yuddha Ebong Krishna\" he has discussed on the role of Krishna in Kurukshetra War.\n\n Bhaduri is directing a project on \"Encyclopedia of Puranas\" which is being sponsored by Bengali book publisher \"Sahitya Samsad\" and Netaji Subhas Institute of Asian Studies. Indian article authors said that his work was expected to challenge many long-held beliefs about the epics. Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey of \"The Times of India\" said 'The encyclopaedia will challenge claims of certain Indian scholars, who under Western influences have often tried to \"sanitise\" the character of Krishna. In Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's Krishnacharitra, for instance, Krishna is supposed to not have even a single consort.' Jaideep Mazumdar of \"The Times of India\" said \"the encyclopaedia will shatter the colonial hangover that a lot of the research into our ancient scriptures in recent times have suffered from and will present many historical figures in a new light.\"\n\nNrisingha Prasad Bhaduri was quoted in an interview as saying–\nI thought it would be a good idea since all the smaller encyclopedias I came across on the Puranas were incomplete and didn't have proper reference labels. I started poring through the Puranas and making card entries. After sometime, I thought I should include the Mahabharata also since the stories in the Mahabharata have a parampara (continuity and tradition) with the Puranas. For instance, names of some kings, conventions and rituals for marriages, childbirth and funerals that are found in the Vedas find mention in the Mahabharata as well. And gaps in the Mahabharata's stories, I discovered, can be filled from the Puranas and the Vedas. And since the story of Ramayana is found in a gist in the Mahabharata, I finally decided that a complete encyclopaedia of the epics and the Puranas is necessary since all these texts and scriptures complement each other.\n\nThough the project was planned long ago, it started in 2010. According to a report published in \"The Times of India\" in August 2012, Debojyoti Dutta, chief of the publication requested Bhaduri to lead the project. Firstly, they planned to make the encyclopaedia on the \"Mahabharata\" only, but found it was too difficult to cover only one of the epics. For example, the Hindu epic character Krishna is found in a section of the \"Ramayana\" too.\n\nBecause of the complexity and difficulty of the project it took Bhaduri one decade to work on the concept alone. Bhaduri took assistance from research scholars of Netaji Subhas Institute of Asian Studies. The team felt they could finish the project by 2013, but later Bhaduri told– \"after going full steam we realised that it is going to be more difficult than we thought. I think we will go well into 2015\".\n"}

These modifications were deemed to be necessary by the Imperial Japanese Navy as a result of the \"Battleships Holiday\" that was imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty, which strictly limited the construction of new battleships.\n\nPagoda masts were built on existing tripod masts by adding platforms, lookouts and shelters upon each other, the end result resembling a pagoda temple. They featured a mass of platforms that included watch points, searchlights, and spotting points. The superstructures were constructed on the majority of the ships that were rebuilt by the Japanese, including the \"Kongō\"-class battlecruisers and the \"Fusō\", \"Ise\", and \"Nagato\"-class battleships. The additional platforms were supported on the ships' original tripod foremasts (a design also extensively used by the Royal Navy) and these were suitably strengthened to bear the extra weight they had to carry.\n\nLike the British Royal Navy, which was considered to be the likely enemy of Japan in the event of an armed conflict, the Imperial Japanese Navy wanted to prepare their warships for engaging in combat during the night. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, powerful searchlights were placed on the pagoda masts for the purpose of illuminating enemy ships at night. However, during the early 1940s, the searchlights mounted on the pagoda became less important as new radar technology was developed that allowed a ship to aim and shoot at targets during the night.\n\nIn the navies of Europe and the Americas, tall pagoda-style masts were generally frowned upon. Naval architects and sailors from the Western hemisphere claimed that the Japanese battleships were too \"top-heavy\" and critics often mocked these vessels by nicknaming them \"Christmas Trees\". Regardless of how valid these criticisms actually were, some of the pagoda masts that were built on Japanese warships during the 1930s were indeed very large. For instance, the top of the pagoda mast of the Imperial Japanese battleship \"Fusō\" was above the waterline.\n\nJapanese battleship \"Ise\", showing the development of her pagoda mast over time.\n"}
{"id": "41602973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41602973", "title": "Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)", "text": "Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)\n\nPariṇāma-vāda (), or theTransformation theory is that which pre-supposes the cause to be continually transforming itself into its effects, and it has three variations – the Satkarya-vada of the Samkhyas, the Prakrti Parinama-vada of the Saiva Siddhanta and the Brahma-Parinama-vada of the Vishishtadvaita Vedanta School of Thought.\n\nIn Indian philosophy, there are basically three major cosmological theories of origination – 1) Arambha-vada (the theory of atomic agglomeration, based on the theory of Asatkarya-vada that the effect, which is something newly produced, does not exist in the cause), 2) Parinama-vada (the theory of real transformation, based on satkarya-vada that the effect, though phenomenally different, is substantially identical with the cause, and pre-exists latently in it), and 3) Vivartavada (the theory of apparent transformation or of false appearance). There is also the fourth, Pratityasamutpada-vada, the theory of dependent origination of Buddhism.\n\nAccording to the Sat-Karya-vada of the Samkhya School of Vedanta, also accepted by the Vishishtadvaitavada Vedanta, causation is the manifestation of what is in the latent condition in the cause. The Prakrti Parnama-vada is based on the premise that the world is a transformation of the primordial Nature or Prakrti. According to the Brahman Parinama-vada, the world is a transformation of Brahman.\nParināma-vāda is the term that refers to the Monotheistic Schools’ theory of ‘actual transformation’ different from Vivartavada, the Monistic Schools’ theory of apparent transformation. It is the theory that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. According to the Brahman-parinama, this universe is a real transformation of Brahman.\n\nThe Arambha-vada theory of causation is advocated by the Nyaya School, which is the creationistic view of causation and implies new creation as the effect that puts an end to its antecedent nonexistence and marks a new beginning. According to this school the effect, being the counter-entity of its prior nonexistence, must be held to be nonexistent before its appearance as an effect although it arose out of a previously existent cause. This theory is the reverse of Parinama-vada.\n\nThe general Vedanta view is that Brahman is both, the Material and the Efficient, cause of the entire universe. There is nothing outside the Omnipresent Brahman. Brahman is the only being which contains the elements of cit and a-cit which are transformed into the forms of individual souls and material objects. There is no external world of souls and matter produced out of external material causes, and the very concept of Pradhana or Primal Matter, outside Brahman, involves contradiction.\n\nAccording to this philosophy, which follows from Sat-Karya-vada, the cause first, potentially contains the effect in it as its Shakti (power), in an un-manifest way; then through the instrumentality of the efficient cause, that potential, latent, un-manifest effect is made actual, patent and manifest. Creation is not a new beginning but the manifestation of the already present un-manifest. The world, as the effect arisen from the pure cause, cannot be impure and imperfect because Brahman, the pure essence, merely transforms itself and does not change, and therefore, remains the same always, whereas the effects are mere names, due to words, for knowing and identifying the effects.\n\nPrakrti is orderly. The Ṛta (order) that makes Prakrti appear to be composed of sub-systems arranged hierarchically with each sub-system being progressively inclusive, co-ordinating and interdependent is traditionally held to be the main basis of the doctrine of pre-existent effect or Sat-Karya-vada or the doctrine of real transformation or Parinama-vada, which R.A.Sinari states is “the earliest and epistemologically the most valuable attempt made in Indian Philosophy to set up a theory of causal order”. All phenomena, belonging to the surface and/or the deeper structure of Prakrti, are parinama i.e. transformation, of one and the same substratum.\n\nThe Svetasvatara Upanishad says: मायां तु प्रकृतिं – “Know Maya to be Prakrti”. But, both the Samkhya School and the Brahma Sutras base their understandings of the process of transformation for origination of things on the will of the creator. Badarayana by stating – नासतोऽदृष्टत्वात् | (Brahma Sutra 2.2.26), declares that Existence does not come out of non-existence. The entire creation is the result of Brahman’s will – अभिध्योपदेशाच्च | (Brahma Sutra 1.4.24), and that all transmigratory existence has no beginning - उपपद्यते चाप्युलभ्यते च | (Brahma Sutra 2.1.36).\n\nTantra has influenced the Hindu, the Buddhist and the Jain traditions. According to the Srividya and the Saivite texts, the thirty-six tattvas covering the entire range of the un-manifest and manifest world, from the gross to the most subtle known as siva, pure illumination. Parinama-vada called Sakti parinama-vada, along with the doctrine of Abhasavada or Pratibimbavada, explains the relationship between samvit or Tripura and the world; Tripura refers to the totality of the three-folds – sthula (gross), suksma (subtle) and para (transcendent), it represents. According to Abhasa-vada, samvit is like a mirror and the universe is a reflection appearing on it. But the universe cannot be outside the mirror i.e. citi or samvit. According to Parinama-vada, citi (consciousness) manifests in the form of the universe without losing its pristine nature.\n\nGaudapada treats creation as an imaginary event even though it seems to follow a sequential order. Badarayana also states that creation for Brahman is a mere pastime out of his spontaneity without any extraneous motive. But, Gaudapada, who was aware of the concepts of the real and apparent transformations, develops the doctrine of creation as an illusory transformation of Brahman without recourse to ‘vivarta’ terminology. The followers of Advaita School promoted by Adi Sankara, to whom owing to Maya the world appears as if it is real i.e. distortion or false apprehension of the all encompassing unity of Brahman, use this term ‘vivarta’ to support the principle of the immutability of reality. Vidyaranya reminds us – एकमेवाद्वितीयं सन्नामरूपविवर्जितम् | - that before the creation there existed the Reality, one only, without a second, and without name and form (Panchadasi 5.5), this after explaining (in verse 2.59) that with Brahman as its basis, Maya creates the various objects of the world, just as a variety of pictures are drawn on a wall by the use of different colours, in other words, “Maya makes it possible for the imagination to attribute different changes to the unchangeable”. it is, therefore, said that “Maya resembles avidya, the source of common illusions, and described as the principle of cosmic illusion, thus differing from Prakrti of the Samkhyas which is real in the full sense of the term”.\n\nBoth, Parnama-vada and Vivartavada, have their own critics. Madhava rejects Bhaskara on the ground that it is not possible for Brahman to transform at the loss of original nature, and there cannot exist unbridgeable gulf between Cit (Spirit) and Jada (Matter).239 A perfect being of pure intelligence and bliss cannot evolve out of itself an effect that is inert and wholly lacking in intelligence. Ramanuja accepts the material causality of Brahman which is absolutely without personal modification and which has the transforming Prakrti as its body. Vivarta concept is rejected because Brahman is not the constituent cause of Maya, therefore Brahman cannot be the constituent cause of the world through Maya.\n"}

It was co-written by Roinsard, Daniel Presley and Romain Compingt. \"Populaire\" was released in France on 28 November 2012. The film's title is taken from the name of the typewriter (Japy Populaire) used in the film. \"Populaire\" tells the story of Rose Pamphyle (Déborah François), who is trained by Louis Échard (Romain Duris) to become the fastest typist in the world through winning the 1959 international speed typing contest in New York City.\n\nSet in 1958–1959, \"Populaire\" focuses on Rose Pamphyle (Déborah François), who lives with her widowed father and is destined to marry a son of the local mechanic. Rose travels out of town and applies for a secretarial job with an insurance agency run by Louis Échard (Romain Duris). Louis learns that Rose can type with extraordinary speed -- using only two fingers -- and he tells her to compete in a speed-typing competition if she wants the job. \n\nWhile Rose makes the finals, she ultimately loses her first typing competition. Louis begins training Rose to become the fastest typist in the world. He makes a bet with his best friend, Bob Taylor -- who is married to his old sweetheart, Marie -- that Rose can win the regional competition.\n\nLouis begins to train Rose at his home, but he sets strict rules to prevent others from knowing that Rose is staying in his boyhood bedroom. He begins to teach her to type with all ten fingers and Louis insists she take piano lessons (taught by Marie) to strengthen her fingers. As she struggles to learn to type with ten fingers, Louis encourages her, colour-coding the keys on her typewriter and teaching her better posture. As the seasons change, she excels and Louis and Rose become close friends. \n\nRose wins her second typing competition, becoming the fastest in her home region of Lower Normandy. It becomes obvious to Louis' friends that Louis and Rose are romantically interested in each other, but Louis insists that a coach mustn't distract his student. They travel together to Paris and the night before the French national competition, Louis and Rose announce their love to one another and have sex.\n\nCompeting against the current national champion, Rose makes it to the finals, but struggles under the pressure. Before her final match, Louis tells Rose that he had been lying and that he has secretly been recording that her typing speed is regularly faster than her opponent's best record. Angered by his lie, Rose is enraged into winning. Rose is ecstatic at winning and flashes Louis a big smile from on stage. After initially being elated, Louis begins to feel inadequate for somewhat ambiguous reasons. He abandons her and their training sessions.\n\nRose stays in Paris and becomes a French celebrity, endorsed by a major typing firm and begins using their newest typewriter. She never forgets Louis and calls him regularly, although Louis never answers the phone. Louis tries to move on, but is generally depressed and feels inadequate. Rose begins to move on and is soon in New York at the world typing competition.\n\nWhile Rose starts the world competition in New York, Louis struggles with his own feelings. He reaches out to Marie and asks why she chose Bob over him. She says she didn't: Louis chose to be second place. Louis explains that he could never give Rose the smile and happiness the she had when she won in Paris -- the same smile that he saw on Marie on her wedding day to Bob. Marie says, \"I was smiling because I felt loved.\"\n\nLouis realises he needs to overcome his own feelings of inadequacy and flies to New York to support Rose in the international typing competition. He arrives just before the second round of the finals ends. As the judges announce the results, Rose is behind and struggling. She runs back stage to fetch her old typewriter, and Louis confronts her and professes his love. They kiss. \n\nRose goes on stage for the last round - seemingly energised by love. She races ahead in the final match. About half way in, her typewriter jams. She is too fast for the typewriter. She quickly recovers and races ahead again, winning the competition to be the World's Fastest Typist. Louis walks on stage and kisses her, ending the film on the two holding hands and the audience cheering.\n\nRoinsard was planning to cast an unknown actress in the lead role of Rose Pamphyle, but chose Belgian actress Déborah François after she impressed him in her audition. After asking her father to find a typewriter for her, François practised for a week before the audition. She told Georgia Dehn from \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"I was so fast at the audition that everyone watching asked whether I had done it much before. Of course I didn't admit to practising. I told them, 'I'm just really motivated, I really want the part, I'm ready for competition.'\"\nFrançois believed that she connected with Rose as soon as she finished reading the script. She loved Rose's clumsiness and thought she was a bit like herself. François underwent six months of professional typing coaching before filming commenced. She had to practice for up to three hours every day. The actress explained that as they wanted it to be real, nothing is sped up in the film and her hands are featured in every scene.\n\nRomain Duris was cast as Louis Échard. Duris was initially concerned about whether the costumes and style would take over causing the film to be stuck in the past. He said he needed the film to feel live and real. The actor watched several films starring Cary Grant and James Stewart as well as French classics directed by Marcel Carné and Claude Chabrol to see the differences between the provinces and Paris and the ways in which people behaved and spoke in the 1950s.\n\nCostume designer Charlotte David created and designed many of the clothes for the film. David previously created costumes for \"\", which was also set in France in the fifties. Laure Guilbault from \"Women's Wear Daily\" reported that the look of \"Populaire\" was inspired by \"Funny Face\", \"The Seven Year Itch\" and Alfred Hitchcock films. François revealed that she gave her own input for the costumes, saying \"I loved being involved in the creation of costumes. I could say that these suspenders should be thinner, or this skirt should be worn with an extra petticoat, or have a bow added.\" David thought the right lingerie was crucial to the look and pointy bras, girdles and bodices were used to underpin the silhouettes. Some of the lingerie was made by Parisian corsetry house Cadolle.\n\nAs Rose is \"a young provincial woman\", she often wears pretty dresses, while Bejo's character Marie, who is married to an American man, has a casual early Sixties look. David explained that she wanted Marie to be a modern woman and she found printed fabrics for her costumes at De Gilles, a fabric shop in Paris, which she used to make short pants. She then completed the look with silk knit jerseys, ballet shoes, headbands and tight cardigans. Lelia Delval, the hairstylist for \"Populaire\", gave Bejo a red wig to wear, which the actress liked so much, she dyed her real hair red for her next film. The men wore tailor-made suits and tie clips. Duris' character Louis sports a vintage Jaeger-LeCoultre watch.\n\nThe musical score of the film was written by French artists Rob and Emmanuel d'Orlando. The soundtrack also uses pre-existing music tracks. It was released on 28 November 2012. Roinsard decided to use music from three years before and after the year in which the film takes place. When choosing the pre-existing music, Roinsard combined his love of American lounge music, light jazz and '50s composers with French songs by lesser-known artists such as Jack Ary, Jacqueline Boyer and Les Chaussettes Noires, whose singer Eddy Mitchell appears in the film. Roinsard thought Rob and Emmanuel d'Orlando's score added \"great emotional impact to the film.\" The director was inspired by both '50s and '60s recording methods for the score, which was recorded in France. Roinsard added \"The end result is close to a musical and I'm delighted since Stanley Donen and Bob Fosse are favorites of mine.\"\n\n\"Populaire\" had its world premiere at the Sarlat Film Festival. It was then released in France on 28 November 2012. \"Populaire\" played at the Glasgow Film Festival in February, before it was released in the UK on 31 May 2013. The film was released on 6 September 2013 in the United States.\n\n\"Populaire\" earned €406,295 upon its opening weekend in France. The film opened to 450 theatres and landed at number three in the French box office top ten. As of 28 May 2013, \"Populaire\" has grossed $5,315,819 worldwide. \n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 74% approval rating with an average rating of 6.7/10 based on 61 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"The cheerfully frothy \"Populaire\" may lack substance, but its visual appeal – and director Roinsard's confident evocation of 1950s filmmaking tropes – help carry the day.\" Metacritic, which assigns a score of 1–100 to individual film reviews, gave \"Populaire\" an average rating of 57 based on 25 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nJérôme Vermelin from \"Metro France\" commented \"Full of charm, this first film by young director Régis Roinsard is carried by an irresistible duo of Romain Duris and Deborah François.\" Liz Beardsworth from \"Empire\" gave \"Populaire\" three stars and wrote \"Roinsard keeps control of a film that vacillates between frothy fun and more serious social comment and cleverly uses subplots and supporting characters (including \"The Artist's\" Bérénice Bejo) to touch on weightier themes. Quaint, but charming.\" \n\nIndieWire's Kaleem Aftab awarded the film a B− and stated \"With a great cast and sufficient laughs, \"Populaire\" could find international audiences, but it's no \"Amelie\". The orthodox script will not broaden appeal outside the dedicated romcom market and the language barrier may also be a problem for some.\" Boyd van Hoeij, writing for \"Variety\", said the film is \"a colorful and impeccably styled romantic comedy that manages to turn the speed-typing competitions of the 1950s into entertaining cinematic fodder.\" He went on to praise the performances of Duris and François, but thought the story did not quite take any unexpected turns or reveal any deeper emotions.\n\n"}

{"id": "49083839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49083839", "title": "Social employee", "text": "Social employee\n\nA social employee is a worker operating within a social business model. Following an organization's social computing guidelines, social employees use social media tools both for internal workflow and collaboration purposes and for external engagement with customers, prospects and stakeholders through a combination of social media marketing, content marketing, social marketing, and social selling. Social employee programs are considered to be as much about culture and engagement as they are about business processes and best practices. In addition to increased leads and sales, social employee best practices are said to improve business outcomes important to social media marketing, such as increased connections and web traffic, improved brand identification and \"chatter\", and better customer advocacy.\n\nThe term \"social employee\" was first introduced to describe those exhibiting the emerging characteristics of workers operating under a social business model. The concept gained broader recognition in late 2013 with the release of \"The Social Employee\", co-authored by marketing consultants Cheryl Burgess and Mark Burgess. In the book, the term was used to describe the end result of efforts of organizations such as IBM, Adobe, and Cisco to restructure their organizations, using a social business model and social computing principles to address the changing needs of both the workplace and their workers.\n\nThe term is often used interchangeably with similar designations like \"employee advocate\" or \"social employee advocate\". For prominent or upper-level social advocates, the terms \"social leader\" and \"social executive\" are often respectively used.\n\nCrucial to the perceived value of the social employee is the concept of the digital footprint. While organizations are able to generate large bases of followers through social media, research shows that brand marketing and engagement efforts through these networks are not as effective as those of individual employees. In fact, some research indicates that employee experts are more trusted than any other member of an organization. Because of this, social employee programs are designed to train, empower, and support employee engagement efforts in the hopes of authentically engaging larger communities, increasing the frequency of shares, reviews, and other forms of \"earned media\" and expanding the brand's presence on the web.\n\nA foundational concept of the social employee is the idea of the personal or employee brand. This concept first gained popular attention in a 1997 FastCompany article by business leader Tom Peters titled \"The Brand Called You\". In the article, Peters argued that the premium placed on branding impacted workers' lives to such an extent that creating and cultivating a distinct personal brand had become a professional necessity. According to Peters, doing so built trust, loyalty, visibility, influence, and employability.\n\nWith increased adoption of social media tools by both businesses and consumers in the early 21st century, many business leaders became increasingly concerned with social engagement, both internally among employees and externally with customers and other stakeholders. While many in the business community acknowledged the potential social tools had for improved collaboration, productivity, and brand messaging, the concern that employees would misrepresent their brand, disclose proprietary information, or otherwise damage their company's reputation or ability to conduct business persisted.\n\nAs a result, many began to advocate for employee branding as a solution to this problem. This helped give new meaning to the concept of brand ambassadorship, positioning everyday employees in public, and potentially high-profile, engagement roles. Proponents of this approach argued that successful employee engagement depended on training, strong organizational culture, and individual empowerment. This approach was seen as an example of a win-win: The corporate brand benefits from increased transparency and authenticity, while the personal brand benefits through increased visibility and employability.\n\nBecause social employee advocacy is dependent on the perceived authenticity of the employee, engagement is highly valued in social organizations. Further, data show the measurable impact of employee engagement on organizational productivity and profitability:\n\nThe number of professionals working mobile or remote has risen considerably since 2010. While estimates vary, one study found that number of organizations with mobile or remote employees is expected to rise from 24 percent in 2012 to 89 percent by 2020. Other research has estimated that by 2020, 105.4 million professionals will work remotely in America, about 72.3 percent of the total workforce.\n\nThis change has been linked to a rise in social technologies, including biometrics, wearables, near-field communications, and augmented reality. Social employees have also put a greater emphasis on work-life balance, with many believing that advances in technology can directly support efforts in this area. Purported benefits of this shift include a more flexible workforce, reduced business costs, and greater organizational leverage in attracting and retaining top talent.\n\nIn 2009, thought leader Simon Sinek presented a speech called \"How Great Leaders Inspire Action\" at a TEDxPugetSound event. Sinek's central argument in this speech was, \"People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it.\" This concept—that the story behind a business or product offering is a more compelling sales tool than the product itself—is frequently cited in social media marketing as a way to build authentic connections with stakeholders. However, others have argued that for employees to share a brand's story authentically, they must be engaged in that story themselves, and as a result, many companies have made storytelling part of their culture programs. The process of securing employee buy-in and ownership for a brand's story is commonly referred to as \"branding from the inside out\".\n\nAn implicit tenet in social business is that social technologies aren't a barrier to productivity, but rather a path to increased connectivity. The shift in enterprise software systems like IBM Connections to incorporate social communication models, such as mentions, wikis, and newsfeeds, reflects the changing communication dynamics within business. With an increase in diversity and sophistication in collaborative software platforms, social organizations have sought to find new creative ways to utilize these tools and secure employee buy-in around them.\n\nCrowdsourcing has also become popular in social businesses. Examples include AT&T's program The Innovation Pipeline (TIP), begun in 2009, which has generated over 28,000 ideas that have led to over 75 projects with funding exceeding $44 million. IBM has also put considerable resources into such processes, producing its social computing guidelines through employee crowdsourcing, as well as its Connections platform through the Technology Adoption Program (TAP), a more formalized crowdsourcing initiative.\n\nAnother popular form of internal collaboration is the hack day, or hackathon. Organizations such as Netflix, Facebook, and IBM use hack days to pull employees out of their day-to-day work environments and encourage them to collaborate in nontraditional ways in an attempt to drive disruptive innovation.\n\nSocial employees are often encouraged to seek external collaboration opportunities with customers and prospects. For example, Procter & Gamble introduced the Live Well Collaborative to connect with external stakeholders and develop products and services for the 50+ demographic. Beginning in 2010, Dell initiated Customer Advisory Panel (CAP) Days conferences to put customers and employees in direct contact with each other. The initial program proved very popular for the organization, with over 128 million CAP-related impressions generated on Twitter.\n\nA social listener is someone who engages in social listening, or social media monitoring, for professional means. Social employees can use social media monitoring for a variety of reasons, including professional development, industry news and trends, and gauging market sentiment. Some have argued that social listening is one of the most important components of social business, as it enables organizations to collect rich market data, make more informed strategic decisions, and respond to customer needs more authentically.\n\nAdvocates of customer-centricity in social business argue that social media has changed the dynamic from one-way brand messaging to shared interactions between brand and customer. Brand and customer engagement is seen as a means of creating more lasting connections with customers and prospects and empowering them to become brand promoters. Customer-centric interactions are seen to have distinct value to brands, as research shows that prospects are far more likely to trust brand-related messaging from a friend or family member than they are from a brand.\n\nAs a means of building social employees, some social advocates have also called for a broader definition of customer to include the employees themselves. In the book \"The Pursuit of Social Business Excellence\", authors Vala Afshar and Brad Martin made the following argument: A social business operates with the guiding principle that each employee’s responsibility is to serve one another, and that those we serve, even internally, are our customers. To earn internal customer trust and loyalty, each employee must be dependable, available, responsive, and committed to the success of the whole.In \"The Social Employee\", authors Cheryl Burgess and Mark Burgess echo this sentiment:The social employee understands that every customer is an employee somewhere, and that every coworker is a customer in many other places as well. No one likes feeling ignored or otherwise disregarded by a brand. The rise of social media means that every employee with a Twitter profile is a de facto brand ambassador. Social employees are not only aware of this, they work to maximize its impact. By prizing authentic engagement and rich exchanges, the social employee is able to leverage virtual platforms toward real-world results.\n\nThe relatively quick proliferation and prioritization of social media in business has driven a need for organizations to be more flexible and responsive. This in turn has led to a reprioritization of employee skill sets in which adaptability, self-directed learning, and organizational sharing are highly valued. Social training programs are commonly structured around self-directed learning modules, and employees are encouraged to share knowledge resources with others to improve organizational intelligence (see \"Training\").\n\nAccording to Weber Shandwick, 47 percent of employees are either already prepared to advocate for their employers or willing to learn. Of those, 21 percent are what the study refers to as \"ProActivists,\" or early adopters, employees who actively use social media for professional purposes, with about half of this group already posting about their employer through social channels.\n\nMany organizations begin with a social employee pilot program to determine best practices suitable to their organizational structure. Program design depends in part on the size of the organization and the desired scope of social adoption. For instance, whereas Domo implemented a mandatory pilot program requiring the participation of all its staff, Dell recruited approximately 200 employee participants through what was called the Social Media and Communities (SMaC) University.\n\nA common first step in a social employee pilot program is an initial process of discovery in which organizations attempt to identify and quantify their current resources. This can include a roll call of employee early adopters, an internal audit of informal adoption of social tools and practices, or a skills test to determine current adoption rates. For instance, when Adobe conducted an internal audit, it discovered a high rate of employee social adoption. However, because different groups were using different tools across departments, informal employee tool adoption was found to have a negative effect on productivity, creating redundancies and silos.\n\nMany organizations will recruit employees to actively participate in designing the pilot program. A fundamental concern of social media use in business has been its potential for abuse—specifically regarding the release of confidential information, negative or off-brand messages, and security risks. Because of this, one focus in many social employee pilot programs has been to establish a set of social media guidelines. For example, IBM created an internal wiki and invited employees to help build a document laying out acceptable social engagement guidelines. This document has since been adopted by several other organizations.\n\nTo social organizations, social employee training helps to unify employee programs and tools throughout the organization and establishes a common knowledge base and set of best practices to assist employees in sharing and decision-making. Many organizations us a combination of in-person training, digital learning modules, and social learning principles.\n\nSocial employee training often applies the 70/20/10 learning model as its basis. In this model, 70 percent of learning is self-directed, 20 percent is informal mentoring or coaching, and 10 percent is formal training. Applying this dynamic, many organizations work to design a \"digital learning experience\" in which employees can access learning modules and other subject-specific content to help them acquire new skills.\n\nTraining is often divided into mandatory basic skills modules and optional advanced skills modules. To determine what social knowledge an employee needs, a baseline or \"social IQ\" test is often administered. Many organizations, such as Adobe with its Center of Excellence (CoE) and Dell with its SMaC University, have expanded their training programs to establish a more permanent resource for employees.\n\nBecause social employee best practices affect organizational practice and culture in a broad way, upper management and executives are also encouraged to adopt social engagement best practices. Doing so is said to help drive buy-in among the workforce and reinforce organizational commitment to the program. Training for upper management and executives can often involve a process known as \"reverse mentoring,\" in which a lower-level employee is brought in to help develop a senior-level manager's skills and basic digital literacy.\n\nSocial engagement and sharing through both internal and external channels are considered key components of social employee design. Employees are encouraged to communicate with coworkers, customers, prospects, and stakeholders through social channels by sharing industry-related news or user-generated content.\n\nInternally, this process is often centered on keeping employees updated on company and industry news, helping employees collaborate on projects, and building culture. Many enterprise-level social platforms have been developed to facilitate such objectives, including task management platforms, wikis, file-sharing tools, and messaging services.\n\nExternally, the focus is often on customer engagement, often through content marketing practices. Research has shown that social sharing can have a positive impact on metrics such as brand engagement, web traffic, and sales. The advent of digital commerce has led customers to research products more thoroughly before make a purchase decision, using social reviews, peer recommendations, and product-specific content to help guide their decisions. Because of the value of peer recommendations specifically, a primary of goal of content marketing is to encourage customers and prospects to share the content among their personal networks as a form of \"earned\" advocacy.\n\nAnother popular social engagement strategy with stakeholders is resharing advocate-generated content through branded channels. This is believed to strengthen relationships with stakeholders and help to humanize the brand.\n\nMeasuring the success social employee advocacy programs has presented a challenge to many organizations. While a small percentage of organizations assert that they are able to measure and validate their investment in social marketing, a larger percentage is either only qualitatively aware of the success of their social efforts or unable to measure whatsoever.\n\nSocial business thought leaders argue that assessing the success of social employee programs must take into account more than financial return on investment (ROI). Companies that consider a broader set of metrics than financial return often measure success through a variety of key performance indicators:\nMany organizations, however, do report financial benefits as well. Social employees are more likely to exceed their sales quota, and social businesses in general are more likely to see increased sales leads and increase in revenues.\n\nCulture-building programs vary in scope and complexity, but all use social media in some way to underscore employee, departmental, or organizational accomplishments. Program leaders will issue social engagement challenges to help employees meet goals. Challenges can include number of connections (i.e., likes or follows, retweets), number of leads, or frequency of posts (i.e., status updates, tweets, blogs, etc.). For a more competitive element, some organizations will employ gamification strategies such as leaderboards, achievement badges, and scavenger hunts.\n"}

{"id": "22584291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22584291", "title": "Watson (computer)", "text": "Watson (computer)\n\nWatson is a question-answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language, developed in IBM's DeepQA project by a research team led by principal investigator David Ferrucci. Watson was named after IBM's first CEO, industrialist Thomas J. Watson.\n\nThe computer system was initially developed to answer questions on the quiz show \"Jeopardy!\" and, in 2011, the Watson computer system competed on \"Jeopardy!\" against legendary champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings winning the first place prize of $1 million.\n\nIn February 2013, IBM announced that Watson software system's first commercial application would be for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, in conjunction with health insurance company WellPoint. IBM Watson's former business chief, Manoj Saxena, says that 90% of nurses in the field who use Watson now follow its guidance.\n\nWatson was created as a question answering (QA) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning technologies to the field of open domain question answering.\n\nThe key difference between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns a list of documents, ranked in order of relevance to the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language, seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns a precise answer to the question.\n\nWhen created, IBM stated that, \"more than 100 different techniques are used to analyze natural language, identify sources, find and generate hypotheses, find and score evidence, and merge and rank hypotheses.\"\n\nIn recent years, the Watson capabilities have been extended and the way in which Watson works has been changed to take advantage of new deployment models (Watson on IBM Cloud) and evolved machine learning capabilities and optimised hardware available to developers and researchers. It is no longer purely a question answering (QA) computing system designed from Q&A pairs but can now 'see', 'hear', 'read', 'talk', 'taste', 'interpret', 'learn' and 'recommend'.\n\nWatson uses IBM's DeepQA software and the Apache UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) framework implementation. The system was written in various languages, including Java, C++, and Prolog, and runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 operating system using the Apache Hadoop framework to provide distributed computing.\n\nThe system is workload-optimized, integrating massively parallel POWER7 processors and built on IBM's \"DeepQA\" technology, which it uses to generate hypotheses, gather massive evidence, and analyze data. Watson employs a cluster of ninety IBM Power 750 servers, each of which uses a 3.5 GHz POWER7 eight-core processor, with four threads per core. In total, the system has 2,880 POWER7 processor threads and 16 terabytes of RAM.\n\nAccording to John Rennie, Watson can process 500 gigabytes, the equivalent of a million books, per second. IBM's master inventor and senior consultant, Tony Pearson, estimated Watson's hardware cost at about three million dollars.\nIts Linpack performance stands at 80 TeraFLOPs, which is about half as fast as the cut-off line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list. According to Rennie, all content was stored in Watson's RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to be competitive with human Jeopardy champions.\n\nThe sources of information for Watson include encyclopedias, dictionaries, thesauri, newswire articles and literary works. Watson also used databases, taxonomies and ontologies. Specifically, DBPedia, WordNet and Yago were used. The IBM team provided Watson with millions of documents, including dictionaries, encyclopedias and other reference material that it could use to build its knowledge.\n\nWatson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases. Watson's main innovation was not in the creation of a new algorithm for this operation but rather its ability to quickly execute hundreds of proven language analysis algorithms simultaneously. The more algorithms that find the same answer independently the more likely Watson is to be correct. Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions, it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense or not.\n\nWatson's basic working principle is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human \"Jeopardy!\" players. Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response. Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.\n\nIn a sequence of 20 mock games of \"Jeopardy\", human participants were able to use the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding. During that time, Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal. Part of the system used to win the \"Jeopardy!\" contest was the electronic circuitry that receives the \"ready\" signal and then examined whether Watson's confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer. Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times, Watson's reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated (instead of reacted to) the ready signal. After signaling, Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in \"Jeopardy!\" question format. Watson's voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM text-to-speech program in 2004.\n\nThe \"Jeopardy!\" staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz, which was critical in many rounds. The humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to perceive. Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds. The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light, but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time. Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.\n\nSince Deep Blue's victory over Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM had been on the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the restaurant they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then in the middle of his successful 74-game run on \"Jeopardy!\". Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing \"Jeopardy!\" with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on \"Jeopardy!\", Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.\n\nIn initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, the senior manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 clues from past \"Jeopardy!\" programs. While the best real-life competitors buzzed in half the time and responded correctly to as many as 95% of clues, Watson's first pass could get only about 15% correct. During 2007, the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems. By 2008, the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with \"Jeopardy!\" champions. By February 2010, Watson could beat human \"Jeopardy!\" contestants on a regular basis.\n\nDuring the game, Watson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four terabytes of disk storage including the full text of the 2011 edition of Wikipedia, but was not connected to the Internet. For each clue, Watson's three most probable responses were displayed on the television screen. Watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on the game's signaling device, but had trouble in a few categories, notably those having short clues containing only a few words.\n\nAlthough the system is primarily an IBM effort, Watson's development involved faculty and graduate students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, the University of Texas at Austin, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Trento, as well as students from New York Medical College.\n\nIn 2008, IBM representatives communicated with \"Jeopardy!\" executive producer Harry Friedman about the possibility of having Watson compete against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, two of the most successful contestants on the show, and the program's producers agreed. Watson's differences with human players had generated conflicts between IBM and \"Jeopardy!\" staff during the planning of the competition. IBM repeatedly expressed concerns that the show's writers would exploit Watson's cognitive deficiencies when writing the clues, thereby turning the game into a Turing test. To alleviate that claim, a third party randomly picked the clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast. \"Jeopardy!\" staff also showed concerns over Watson's reaction time on the buzzer. Originally Watson signalled electronically, but show staff requested that it press a button physically, as the human contestants would. Even with a robotic \"finger\" pressing the buzzer, Watson remained faster than its human competitors. Ken Jennings noted, \"If you're trying to win on the show, the buzzer is all\", and that Watson \"can knock out a microsecond-precise buzz every single time with little or no variation. Human reflexes can't compete with computer circuits in this regard.\" Stephen Baker, a journalist who recorded Watson's development in his book \"Final Jeopardy\", reported that the conflict between IBM and \"Jeopardy!\" became so serious in May 2010 that the competition was almost canceled. As part of the preparation, IBM constructed a mock set in a conference room at one of its technology sites to model the one used on \"Jeopardy!\". Human players, including former \"Jeopardy!\" contestants, also participated in mock games against Watson with Todd Alan Crain of \"The Onion\" playing host. About 100 test matches were conducted with Watson winning 65% of the games.\n\nTo provide a physical presence in the televised games, Watson was represented by an \"avatar\" of a globe, inspired by the IBM \"smarter planet\" symbol. Jennings described the computer's avatar as a \"glowing blue ball criss-crossed by 'threads' of thought—42 threads, to be precise\", and stated that the number of thought threads in the avatar was an in-joke referencing the significance of the number 42 in Douglas Adams' \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". Joshua Davis, the artist who designed the avatar for the project, explained to Stephen Baker that there are 36 triggerable states that Watson was able to use throughout the game to show its confidence in responding to a clue correctly; he had hoped to be able to find forty-two, to add another level to the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" reference, but he was unable to pinpoint enough game states.\n\nA practice match was recorded on January 13, 2011, and the official matches were recorded on January 14, 2011. All participants maintained secrecy about the outcome until the match was broadcast in February.\n\nIn a practice match before the press on January 13, 2011, Watson won a 15-question round against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a score of $4,400 to Jennings's $3,400 and Rutter's $1,200, though Jennings and Watson were tied before the final $1,000 question. None of the three players responded incorrectly to a clue.\n\nThe first round was broadcast February 14, 2011, and the second round, on February 15, 2011. The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter. Watson, represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category, a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible. Watson's guess at the Daily Double location was correct. At the end of the first round, Watson was tied with Rutter at $5,000; Jennings had $2,000.\n\nWatson's performance was characterized by some quirks. In one instance, Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings. (Jennings said \"What are the '20s?\" in reference to the 1920s. Then Watson said \"What is 1920s?\") Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response. In another instance, Watson was initially given credit for a response of \"What is a leg?\" after Jennings incorrectly responded \"What is: he only had one hand?\" to a clue about George Eyser (the correct response was, \"What is: he's missing a leg?\"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect. The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek's original acceptance of Watson's response. Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles, with one bet at $6,435 and another at $1,246. Gerald Tesauro, one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson, explained that Watson's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator.\n\nWatson took a commanding lead in Double Jeopardy!, correctly responding to both Daily Doubles. Watson responded to the second Daily Double correctly with a 32% confidence score.\n\nAlthough it wagered only $947 on the clue, Watson was the only contestant to miss the Final Jeopardy! response in the category U.S. CITIES (\"Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero; its second largest, for a World War II battle\"). Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago, but Watson's response was \"What is Toronto?????\" Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to have guessed a Canadian city: categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired, the phrase \"U.S. city\" did not appear in the question, there are cities named Toronto in the U.S., and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team. Dr. Chris Welty, who also worked on Watson, suggested that it may not have been able to correctly parse the second part of the clue, \"its second largest, for a World War II battle\" (which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon, and required context to understand that it was referring to a second-largest \"airport\"). Eric Nyberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team, stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable. Although not displayed to the audience as with non-Final Jeopardy! questions, Watson's second choice was Chicago. Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson's confidence threshold, at 14% and 11% respectively. (This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watson's response.)\n\nThe game ended with Jennings with $4,800, Rutter with $10,400, and Watson with $35,734.\n\nDuring the introduction, Trebek (a Canadian native) joked that he had learned Toronto was a U.S. city, and Watson's error in the first match prompted an IBM engineer to wear a Toronto Blue Jays jacket to the recording of the second match.\n\nIn the first round, Jennings was finally able to choose a Daily Double clue, while Watson responded to one Daily Double clue incorrectly for the first time in the Double Jeopardy! Round. After the first round, Watson placed second for the first time in the competition after Rutter and Jennings were briefly successful in increasing their dollar values before Watson could respond. Nonetheless, the final result ended with a victory for Watson with a score of $77,147, besting Jennings who scored $24,000 and Rutter who scored $21,600.\n\nThe prizes for the competition were $1 million for first place (Watson), $300,000 for second place (Jennings), and $200,000 for third place (Rutter). As promised, IBM donated 100% of Watson's winnings to charity, with 50% of those winnings going to World Vision and 50% going to World Community Grid. Similarly, Jennings and Rutter donated 50% of their winnings to their respective charities.\n\nIn acknowledgment of IBM and Watson's achievements, Jennings made an additional remark in his Final Jeopardy! response: \"I for one welcome our new computer overlords\", echoing a similar memetic reference to the episode \"Deep Space Homer\" on \"The Simpsons\", in which TV news presenter Kent Brockman speaks of welcoming \"our new insect overlords\". Jennings later wrote an article for \"Slate\", in which he stated: IBM has bragged to the media that Watson's question-answering skills are good for more than annoying Alex Trebek. The company sees a future in which fields like medical diagnosis, business analytics, and tech support are automated by question-answering software like Watson. Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the 20th century by new assembly-line robots, Brad and I were the first knowledge-industry workers put out of work by the new generation of 'thinking' machines. 'Quiz show contestant' may be the first job made redundant by Watson, but I'm sure it won't be the last.\n\nPhilosopher John Searle argues that Watson—despite impressive capabilities—cannot actually think. Drawing on his Chinese room thought experiment, Searle claims that Watson, like other computational machines, is capable only of manipulating symbols, but has no ability to understand the meaning of those symbols; however, Searle's experiment has its detractors.\n\nOn February 28, 2011, Watson played an untelevised exhibition match of \"Jeopardy!\" against members of the United States House of Representatives. In the first round, Rush D. Holt, Jr. (D-NJ, a former \"Jeopardy!\" contestant), who was challenging the computer with Bill Cassidy (R-LA, later Senator from Louisiana), led with Watson in second place. However, combining the scores between all matches, the final score was $40,300 for Watson and $30,000 for the congressional players combined.\n\nIBM's Christopher Padilla said of the match, \"The technology behind Watson represents a major advancement in computing. In the data-intensive environment of government, this type of technology can help organizations make better decisions and improve how government helps its citizens.\"\n\nAccording to IBM, \"The goal is to have computers start to interact in natural human terms across a range of applications and processes, understanding the questions that humans ask and providing answers that humans can understand and justify.\" It has been suggested by Robert C. Weber, IBM's general counsel, that Watson may be used for legal research. The company also intends to use Watson in other information-intensive fields, such as telecommunications, financial services and government.\n\nWatson is based on commercially available IBM Power 750 servers that have been marketed since February 2010. IBM also intends to market the DeepQA software to large corporations, with a price in the millions of dollars, reflecting the $1 million needed to acquire a server that meets the minimum system requirement to operate Watson. IBM expects the price to decrease substantially within a decade as the technology improves.\n\nCommentator Rick Merritt said that \"there's another really important reason why it is strategic for IBM to be seen very broadly by the American public as a company that can tackle tough computer problems. A big slice of [IBM's profit] comes from selling to the U.S. government some of the biggest, most expensive systems in the world.\"\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that three companies were working with IBM to create apps embedded with Watson technology. Fluid is developing an app for retailers, one called \"The North Face\", which is designed to provide advice to online shoppers. Welltok is developing an app designed to give people advice on ways to engage in activities to improve their health. MD Buyline is developing an app for the purpose of advising medical institutions on equipment procurement decisions.\n\nIn November 2013, IBM announced it would make Watson's API available to software application providers, enabling them to build apps and services that are embedded in Watson's capabilities. To build out its base of partners who create applications on the Watson platform, IBM consults with a network of venture capital firms, which advise IBM on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what IBM calls the Watson Ecosystem. Thus far, roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with IBM, with interest in creating applications that could use the Watson platform.\n\nOn January 30, 2013, it was announced that Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute would receive a successor version of Watson, which would be housed at the Institute's technology park and be available to researchers and students. By summer 2013, Rensselaer had become the first university to receive a Watson computer.\n\nOn February 6, 2014, it was reported that IBM plans to invest $100 million in a 10-year initiative to use Watson and other IBM technologies to help countries in Africa address development problems, beginning with healthcare and education.\n\nOn June 3, 2014, three new Watson Ecosystem partners were chosen from more than 400 business concepts submitted by teams spanning 18 industries from 43 countries. \"These bright and enterprising organizations have discovered innovative ways to apply Watson that can deliver demonstrable business benefits\", said Steve Gold, vice president, IBM Watson Group. The winners were Majestyk Apps with their adaptive educational platform, FANG (Friendly Anthropomorphic Networked Genome); Red Ant with their retail sales trainer; and GenieMD with their medical recommendation service.\n\nOn July 9, 2014, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories announced plans to integrate Watson to improve their customer experience platform, citing the sheer volume of customer data to analyze is staggering.\n\nWatson has been integrated with databases including \"Bon Appétit\" magazine to perform a recipe generating platform.\n\nWatson is being used by Decibel, a music discovery startup, in its app MusicGeek which uses the supercomputer to provide music recommendations to its users. The use of the artificial intelligence of Watson has also been found in the hospitality industry. GoMoment uses Watson for its Rev1 app, which gives hotel staff a way to quickly respond to questions from guests. Arria NLG has built an app that helps energy companies stay within regulatory guidelines, making it easier for managers to make sense of thousands of pages of legal and technical jargon.\n\nOmniEarth, Inc. uses Watson computer vision services to analyze satellite and aerial imagery, along with other municipal data, to infer water usage on a property-by-property basis, helping water districts in drought-stricken California improve water conservation efforts.\n\nIn September 2016, Condé Nast has started using IBM's Watson to help build and strategize social influencer campaigns for brands. Using software built by IBM and Influential, Condé Nast's clients will be able to know which influencer's demographics, personality traits and more best align with a marketer and the audience it is targeting.\n\nIn February 2017, Rare Carat, a New York City-based startup and e-commerce platform for buying diamonds and diamond rings, introduced an IBM Watson-powered artificial intelligence chatbot called \"Rocky\" to assist novice diamond buyers through the daunting process of purchasing a diamond. As part of the IBM Global Entrepreneur Program, Rare Carat received the assistance of IBM in the development of the Rocky Chat Bot.\nIn May 2017, IBM partnered with the Pebble Beach Company to use Watson as a concierge. Watson's artificial intelligence was added to an app developed by Pebble Beach and was used to guide visitors around the resort. The mobile app was designed by IBM iX and hosted on the IBM Cloud. It uses Watson's Conversation applications programming interface.\n\nIn November 2017, in Mexico City, the Experience Voices of Another Time was opened at the National Museum of Anthropology using IBM Watson as an alternative to visiting a museum.\n\nIn healthcare, Watson's natural language, hypothesis generation, and evidence-based learning capabilities are being investigated to see how Watson may contribute to clinical decision support systems and the increase in Artificial intelligence in healthcare for use by medical professionals. To aid physicians in the treatment of their patients, once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors, Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information; then mines patient data to find facts relevant to the patient's medical and hereditary history; then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses; and finally provides a list of individualized, confidence-scored recommendations. The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data, notes from healthcare providers, research materials, clinical studies, journal articles and patient information. Despite being developed and marketed as a \"diagnosis and treatment advisor\", Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process, only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed.\n\nIn February 2011, it was announced that IBM would be partnering with Nuance Communications for a research project to develop a commercial product during the next 18 to 24 months, designed to exploit Watson's clinical decision support capabilities. Physicians at Columbia University would help to identify critical issues in the practice of medicine where the system's technology may be able to contribute, and physicians at the University of Maryland would work to identify the best way that a technology like Watson could interact with medical practitioners to provide the maximum assistance.\n\nIn September 2011, IBM and WellPoint announced a partnership to utilize Watson's data crunching capability to help suggest treatment options to physicians. Then, in February 2013, IBM and WellPoint gave Watson its first commercial application, for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nIBM announced a partnership with Cleveland Clinic in October 2012. The company has sent Watson to the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, where it will increase its health expertise and assist medical professionals in treating patients. The medical facility will utilize Watson's ability to store and process large quantities of information to help speed up and increase the accuracy of the treatment process. \"Cleveland Clinic's collaboration with IBM is exciting because it offers us the opportunity to teach Watson to 'think' in ways that have the potential to make it a powerful tool in medicine\", said C. Martin Harris, MD, chief information officer of Cleveland Clinic.\n\nIn 2013, IBM and MD Anderson Cancer Center began a pilot program to further the center's \"mission to eradicate cancer\". However, after spending $62 million, the project did not meet its goals and it has been stopped.\n\nOn February 8, 2013, IBM announced that oncologists at the Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Westmed Medical Group in New York have started to test the Watson supercomputer system in an effort to recommend treatment for lung cancer.\n\nOn July 29, 2016, IBM and Manipal Hospitals(a leading hospital chain in India), announced launch of IBM Watson for Oncology, for cancer patients. This product provides information and insights to physicians and cancer patients to help them identify personalized, evidence-based cancer care options. Manipal Hospitals is the second hospital in the world to adopt this technology and first in the world to offer it to patients online as an expert second opinion through their website.\n\nOn January 7, 2017, IBM and Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance entered into a contract for IBM to deliver analysis to compensation payouts via its IBM Watson Explorer AI, this resulted in the loss of 34 jobs and the company said it would speed up compensation payout analysis via analysing claims and medical record and increase productivity by 30%. The company also said it would save ¥140m in running costs.\n\nIt is said that IBM Watson will be carrying the knowledge-base of 1000 cancer specialists which will bring a revolution in the field of healthcare. IBM is regarded as a disruptive innovation. However the stream of oncology is still in its nascent stage.\n\nOn January 9, 2014 IBM announced it was creating a business unit around Watson, led by senior vice president Michael Rhodin. IBM Watson Group will have headquarters in New York's Silicon Alley and will employ 2,000 people. IBM has invested $1 billion to get the division going. Watson Group will develop three new cloud-delivered services: Watson Discovery Advisor, Watson Engagement Advisor, and Watson Explorer. Watson Discovery Advisor will focus on research and development projects in pharmaceutical industry, publishing, and biotechnology, Watson Engagement Advisor will focus on self-service applications using insights on the basis of natural language questions posed by business users, and Watson Explorer will focus on helping enterprise users uncover and share data-driven insights based on federated search more easily. The company is also launching a $100 million venture fund to spur application development for \"cognitive\" applications. According to IBM, the cloud-delivered enterprise-ready Watson has seen its speed increase 24 times over—a 2,300 percent improvement in performance and its physical size shrank by 90 percent—from the size of a master bedroom to three stacked pizza boxes. IBM CEO Virginia Rometty said she wants Watson to generate $10 billion in annual revenue within ten years. On 20 September 2017, Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering announced Antonio Torralba as the MIT director of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. In March 2018, IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty proposed \"Watson's Law,\" the \"use of and application of business, smart cities, consumer applications and life in general.\"\n\nWatson is being used via IBM partner program as a Chatterbot to provide the conversation for children's toys.\n\nIn 2015, the engineering firm ENGEO created an online service via the IBM partner program named GoFetchCode. GoFetchCode applies Watson's natural language processing and question-answering capabilities to the International Code Council's model building codes.\n\nIBM Watson is being used for several projects relating to education, and has entered partnerships with Pearson Education, Blackboard, Sesame Workshop and Apple.\n\nIn its partnership with Pearson, Watson is being made available inside electronic text books to provide natural language, one-on-one tutoring to students on the reading material.\n\nAs an individual using the free Watson APIs available to the public, Ashok Goel, a professor at Georgia Tech, used Watson to create a virtual teaching assistant to assist students in his class. Initially, Goel did not reveal the nature of \"Jill\", which was created with the help of a few students and IBM. Jill answered questions where it had a 97% certainty of an accurate answer, with the remainder being answered by human assistants.\n\nThe research group of Sabri Pllana developed an assistant for learning parallel programming using the IBM Watson. A survey with a number of novice parallel programmers at the Linnaeus University indicated that such assistant will be welcome by students that learn parallel programming.\n\nIn August 2016, IBM announced it would be using Watson for weather forecasting. Specifically, the company announced they would use Watson to analyze data from over 200,000 Weather Underground personal weather stations, and data from other sources, as a part of project Deep Thunder.\n\nIBM Watson together with Marchesa designed a dress that changed the colour of the fabric depending on the mood of the audience. The dress lit up in different colours based on the sentiment of Tweets about the dress. Tweets were passed through a Watson tone analyzer and then sent back to a small computer inside the waist of the dress. As social media is an integral part of their business, the Marchesa team loved how Watson could incorporate that information into the glamour of the gown.\n\nOn February 5–6, 2017, tax preparation company H&R Block began nationwide use of a Watson-based program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Other uses include writing on mirrors, chalkboards, plastics, ceramics, glass windows and other non-porous surfaces. The contents of these markers are: water, resin, and titanium dioxide.\n\nThe markers are similar to other products such as dry erase markers, in both their uses and applications, and also in that they come in an assortment of colors. They differ, however, in their use of a quick drying liquid paste as their medium. By using a paste instead of an alcohol base, the marking is semi-permanent, and will not be wiped away by a whiteboard eraser. Additionally, the paste is less likely to cause allergic reaction than dry-erase alcohol or chalk dust.\n\nBecause of their semi-permanent nature, wet wipe markers are often used to draw a template, especially in school classrooms or on calendars (to mark the boxes). Dry erase markers can usually be applied on top of the wet wipe marker, and erased without touching the wet wipe marks.\n\nWet wipe markers were often used on overhead projector transparencies, as they could be stored and transported easily, unlike a traditional chalkboard. With the rise of computerized slide-shows (e.g. PowerPoint) in the classroom and office, overhead usage has reduced substantially, and with it, the wet wipe marker. Marks can then be cleaned off non-porous surfaces with a damp cloth.\n\n"}

The Lower Zips was inhabited by other Central Germans who spoke a similar dialect called \"Gründlerisch\" which is considered to be the same language. Beginning in at least the 18th century, many Zipsers migrated to northern Romania, including to southern Bukovina, where several other Germanic dialects were also spoken. Over time, the speech of the Zipsers in Romania was heavily influenced by that of people from Upper Austria who settled among them and were ultimately assimilated into the Zipser ethnic community. During and after the Second World War, most Zipsers evacuated or were expelled to Germany, but a community of speakers remains in Hopgarten; their distinctive dialect is called \"Outzäpsersch\" (German: \"Altzipserisch\", literally \"Old Zipserish\").\n\nThe dialect spoken in Bukovina, Gründlerisch in origin, was characterized by the shift of original (Middle High German) /v/ to /b/ and of original /b/ to /p/.
