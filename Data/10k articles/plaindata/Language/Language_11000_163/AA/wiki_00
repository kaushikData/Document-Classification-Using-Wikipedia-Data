{"id": "18940550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18940550", "title": "Albanian language", "text": "Albanian language\n\nAlbanian ( , or ) is a language of the Indo-European family, in which it occupies an independent branch. It is an official language in Albania and Kosovo and has official minority status in Italy, Romania, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia and others. The language has an official status in Ulcinj, southern Montenegro. Albanian is also spoken by large Albanian communities elsewhere in Europe, the Americas and Australia.\n\nThe two main dialects of Albanian are Gheg and Tosk. Gheg is primarily spoken in the north, while Tosk is spoken in the south. Standard Albanian is based on the Tosk dialect. The number of Albanian speakers in the Balkans is estimated to be approximately 5 million.\n\nCenturies-old communities speaking Albanian dialects can be found scattered in Croatia (the Arbanasi), Greece (the Arvanites and some communities in Epirus, Western Macedonia and Western Thrace), Italy (the Arbëreshë immigrants in Italy) as well as in Romania and Ukraine. There is also a large Albanian diaspora.\n\nThe language is spoken by approximately 7 million people primarily in Albania, Kosovo, Greece, Italy, Macedonia and Montenegro. However, due to the large Albanian diaspora, the total number of speakers is much higher than the native speakers in Southern Europe.\n\nThe Albanian language is the official language of Albania and Kosovo. It is spoken by the entire Albanian population in both. Albanian is a recognised minority language in Croatia, Italy, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania and in Serbia. Albanian is also spoken in the Thesprotia and Preveza regional units and in a few villages in Ioannina and Florina regional units in Greece.\n\nAlbanian is the third most spoken language in Italy. This is due to the mass Albanian immigration to Italy. Italy has a historical Albanian minority of about 500,000 which are scattered across southern Italy known as Arbëreshë. Approximately 1 million Albanians from Kosovo are dispersed throughout Germany, Switzerland and Austria. These are mainly refugees from Kosovo that migrated during the Kosovo War. In Switzerland, the Albanian language is the sixth most spoken language with 176,293 native speakers.\n\nThere are large numbers of Albanian speakers in the United States, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Canada. Some of the first ethnic Albanians to arrive in the United States were Arbëreshë. Arbëreshe have a strong sense of identity, and are unique in that they speak an archaic dialect of Tosk Albanian called Arbëreshë.\n\nIn North America (United States and Canada) there are approximately 250,000 Albanian speakers. It is spoken in the eastern area of the United States in cities like New York City, New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia, Ohio, Connecticut and Detroit. Greater New Orleans has a large Arbëresh community. Oftentimes, wherever there are Italians, there are a few Arbëreshe mixed with them. Arbëreshe Americans, therefore are often indistinguishable from Italian Americans due to being assimilated into the Italian American community.\n\nIn Argentina there are nearly 40,000 Albanian speakers, mostly in Buenos Aires.\n\nApproximately 1.3 million people of Albanian ancestry live in Turkey, and more than 500,000 recognizing their ancestry, language and culture. There are other estimates, however, that place the number of people in Turkey with Albanian ancestry and or background upward to 5 million. However, the vast majority of this population is assimilated and no longer possesses fluency in the Albanian language, though a vibrant Albanian community maintains its distinct identity in Istanbul to this day.\n\nIn Egypt there are around 18,000 Albanians, mostly Tosk speakers. Many are descendants of the Janissary of Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian who became Wāli, and self-declared Khedive of Egypt and Sudan. In addition to the dynasty that he established, a large part of the former Egyptian and Sudanese aristocracy was of Albanian origin. In addition to the recent emigrants, there are older diasporic communities around the world.\n\nAlbanian is also spoken by Albanian diaspora communities residing in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe Albanian language has two distinct dialects, Tosk which is spoken in the south, and Gheg spoken in the north. Standard Albanian is based on the Tosk dialect. The Shkumbin river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects.\n\nGheg is divided into four sub-dialects, in Northwest Gheg, Northeast Gheg, Central Gheg, and Southern Gheg. It is primarily spoken in northern Albania and throughout Montenegro, Kosovo and northwestern Macedonia. One fairly divergent dialect is the Upper Reka dialect, which is however classified as Central Gheg. There is also a diaspora dialect in Croatia, the Arbanasi dialect.\n\nTosk is divided into five sub-dialects, including Northern Tosk (the most numerous in speakers), Labërisht, Çam, Arvanitika, and Arbëresh. Tosk is spoken in southern Albania, southwestern Macedonia and northern and southern Greece. Cham Albanian is spoken in North-western Greece, while Arvanitika is spoken by the Arvanites in southern Greece. In addition Arbëresh is spoken by the Arbëreshë people, descendants of 15th and 16th century migrants who settled in southeastern Italy, in small communities in the regions of Sicily and Calabria.\n\nThe Albanian language has been written using many different alphabets since the earliest records from the 14th century. The history of Albanian language orthography is closely related to the cultural orientation and knowledge of certain foreign languages among Albanian writers. The earliest written Albanian records come from the Gheg area in makeshift spellings based on Italian or Greek. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written in the Greek alphabet and the Gheg dialect was written in the Latin script. Both dialects had also been written in the Ottoman Turkish version of the Arabic script, Cyrillic, and some local alphabets (Elbasan, Vithkuqi, Todhri, Veso Bey, Jan Vellara and others, see original Albanian alphabets). More specifically, the writers from northern Albania and under the influence of the Catholic Church used Latin letters, those in southern Albania and under the influence of the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others throughout Albania and under the influence of Islam used Arabic letters. There were initial attempts to create an original Albanian alphabet during the 1750–1850 period. These attempts intensified after the League of Prizren and culminated with the Congress of Manastir held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (present day Bitola), which decided on which alphabet to use, and what the standardized spelling would be for standard Albanian. This is how the literary language remains. The alphabet is the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters <ë>, <ç>, and ten digraphs: \"dh\", \"th\", \"xh\", \"gj\", \"nj\", \"ng\", \"ll\", \"rr\", \"zh\" and \"sh\".\n\nAccording to Robert Elsie:\nThe hundred years between 1750 and 1850 were an age of astounding orthographic diversity in Albania. In this period, the Albanian language was put to writing in at least ten different alphabets – most certainly a record for European languages. ... the diverse forms in which this old Balkan language was recorded, from the earliest documents to the beginning of the twentieth century ... consist of adaptations of the Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Cyrillic alphabets and (what is even more interesting) a number of locally invented writing systems. Most of the latter alphabets have now been forgotten and are unknown, even to the Albanians themselves.\n\nThe Albanian language occupies an independent branch of the Indo-European language tree. In 1854, Albanian was demonstrated to be an Indo-European language by the philologist Franz Bopp. Albanian was formerly compared by a few Indo-European linguists with Germanic and Balto-Slavic, all of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Other linguists linked the Albanian language with Latin, Greek and Armenian, while placing Germanic and Balto-Slavic in another branch of Indo-European.\n\nAccording to the central hypothesis of a project undertaken by the Austrian Science Fund, old Albanian had a significant influence on the development of many languages in the Balkans. This little-known language is being researched using all available texts before a comparison with other Balkan languages is carried out. The outcome of this work will include the compilation of a lexicon providing an overview of all old Albanian verbs. As project leader Dr. Schumacher explains, the research is already bearing fruit:\nSo far, our work has shown that Old Albanian contained numerous modal levels that allowed the speaker to express a particular stance to what was being said. Compared to the existing knowledge and literature, these modal levels are actually more extensive and more nuanced than previously thought. We have also discovered a great many verbal forms that are now obsolete or have been lost through restructuring — until now, these forms have barely even been recognized or, at best, have been classified incorrectly.\nThese verbal forms are crucial to explaining the linguistic history of Albanian and its internal usage. However, they can also shed light on the reciprocal relationship between Albanian and its neighbouring languages. The researchers are following various leads which suggest that Albanian played a key role in the Balkan Sprachbund. For example, it is likely that Albanian is the source of the suffixed definite article in Romanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian, as this has been a feature of Albanian since ancient times.\n\nThe first written mention of the Albanian language was on 14 July 1284 in Dubrovnik in modern Croatia when a crime witness named Matthew testified: \"I heard a voice shouting on the mountainside in the Albanian language\" (). The first audio recording of Albanian was made by Norbert Jokl on April 4, 1914 in Vienna. During the five-century period of the Ottoman presence in Albania, the language was not officially recognized until 1909, when the Congress of Dibra decided that Albanian schools would finally be allowed.\n\nAlbanian is considered an isolate within the Indo-European language family; no other language has been conclusively linked to its branch. The only other languages that are the sole surviving member of a branch of Indo-European are Armenian and Greek.\n\nThe Albanian language is part of the Indo-European language group and is considered to have evolved from one of the Paleo-Balkan languages of antiquity, \nalthough it is still uncertain which particular Paleo-Balkan language represents the ancestor of Albanian, or where in Southern Europe that population lived. In general there is insufficient evidence to connect Albanian with one of those languages, whether one of the Illyrian languages (which historians mostly confirm), or Thracian and Dacian. Among these possibilities, Illyrian is typically held to be the most probable, though insufficient evidence still clouds the discussion.\n\nAlthough Albanian shares lexical isoglosses with Greek, Germanic, and to a lesser extent Balto-Slavic, the vocabulary of Albanian is quite distinct. In 1995, Taylor, Ringe and Warnow, using quantitative linguistic techniques, found that Albanian appears to comprise a \"subgroup with Germanic\". However, they argued that this fact is hardly significant, as Albanian has lost much of its original vocabulary and morphology, and so this \"apparently close connection to Germanic rests on only a couple of lexical cognates – hardly any evidence at all\".\n\nThe earliest loanwords attested in Albanian come from Doric Greek, whereas the strongest influence came from Latin. According to Matthew C. Curtis, the loanwords do not necessarily indicate the geographical location of the ancestor of Albanian language. However, according to other linguists, the borrowed words can help to get an idea about the place of origin and the evolution of the Albanian language. According to another group of linguists, Albanian originates from an area located east of its present geographic spread due to the several common lexical items found between the Albanian and Romanian languages.\n\nThe period during which Proto-Albanian and Latin interacted was protracted, lasting from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. Over this period, the lexical borrowings can be roughly divided into three layers, the second of which is the largest. The first and smallest occurred at the time of less significant interaction. The final period, probably preceding the Slavic or Germanic invasions, also has a notably smaller number of borrowings. Each layer is characterized by a different treatment of most vowels: the first layer follows the evolution of Early Proto-Albanian into Albanian; while later layers reflect vowel changes endemic to Late Latin (and presumably Proto-Romance). Other formative changes include the syncretism of several noun case endings, especially in the plural, as well as a large-scale palatalization.\n\nA brief period followed, between the 7th and the 9th centuries, that was marked by heavy borrowings from Southern Slavic, some of which predate the \"o-a\" shift common to the modern forms of this language group. Starting in the latter 9th century, there was a period characterized by protracted contact with the Proto-Romanians, or Vlachs, though lexical borrowing seems to have been mostly one sided: from Albanian into Romanian. Such borrowing indicates that the Romanians migrated from an area where the majority was Slavic (i.e. Middle Bulgarian) to an area with a majority of Albanian speakers (i.e. Dardania, where Vlachs are recorded in the 10th century). Their movement is presumably related to the expansion of the Bulgarian Empire into Albania around that time.\n\nJernej Kopitar (1780–1844) was the first to note Latin's influence on Albanian and claimed \"the Latin loanwords in the Albanian language had the pronunciation of the time of Emperor Augustus\". Kopitar gave examples such as Albanian \"qiqer\" ‘chickpea’ from Latin \"cicer\", \"qytet\" ‘city, town’ from \"civitas\", \"peshk\" ‘fish’ from \"piscis\", and \"shigjetë\" ‘arrow’ from \"sagitta\". The hard pronunciations of Latin and are retained as palatal and velar stops in the Albanian loanwords. Gustav Meyer (1888) and Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke (1914) later corroborated this. Meyer noted the similarity between the Albanian verbs \"shqipoj\" ‘to speak clearly, enunciate’ and \"shqiptoj\" ‘to pronounce, articulate’ and the Latin word \"excipio\" (meaning \"to welcome\"). Therefore, he believed that the word \"Shqiptar\" ‘Albanian person’ was derived from \"shqipoj\", which in turn was derived from the Latin word \"excipere\". Johann Georg von Hahn, an Austrian linguist, had proposed the same hypothesis in 1854.\n\nEqrem Çabej also noticed, among other things, the archaic Latin elements in Albanian:\n\n\nHaralambie Mihăescu demonstrated that:\n\n\nOther authors have detected Latin loanwords in Albanian with an ancient sound pattern from the 1st century BC, for example, Albanian \"qingël(ë)\" ‘saddle girth; dwarf elder’ from Latin \"cingula\" and Albanian \"e vjetër\" ‘old, aged; former’ from \"vjet\" but influenced by Latin \"veteris\". The Romance languages inherited these words from Vulgar Latin: \"cingula\" became Romanian \"chinga\" ‘girdle; saddle girth’, and Vulgar Latin \"veterānus\" became Romanian \"bătrân\" ‘old’.\n\nAlbanian, Basque, and the surviving Celtic languages such as Breton and Welsh are the non-Romance languages today that have this sort of extensive Latin element dating from ancient Roman times, which has undergone the sound changes associated with the languages. Other languages in or near the former Roman area either came on the scene later (Turkish, the Slavic languages, Arabic) or borrowed little from Latin despite coexisting with it (Greek, German), although German does have a few such ancient Latin loanwords (\"Fenster\" ‘window’, \"Käse\" ‘cheese’, \"Köln\").\n\nRomanian scholars such as Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of the Albanian language, have concluded that Albanian was heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and Dalmatian. Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and Albanian are significantly less than those that are common to only Albanian and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that the Albanian language evolved in a region with much greater contact to Western Romance regions than to Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western Macedonia, spanning east to Bitola and Pristina.\n\n \n\nThe place and the time where the Albanian language was formed is uncertain. American linguist Eric Hamp stated that during an unknown chronological period a pre-Albanian population (termed as \"Albanoid\" by Hamp) inhabited areas stretching from Poland to the southwestern Balkans. Further analysis has suggested that it was in a mountainous region rather than on a plain or seacoast: while the words for plants and animals characteristic of mountainous regions are entirely original, the names for fish and for agricultural activities (such as ploughing) are borrowed from other languages.\n\nA deeper analysis of the vocabulary, however, shows that this could be a consequence of a prolonged Latin domination of the coastal and plain areas of the country, rather than evidence of the original environment where the Albanian language was formed. For example, the word for 'fish' is borrowed from Latin, but not the word for 'gills', which is native. Indigenous are also the words for 'ship', 'raft', 'navigation', 'sea shelves' and a few names of fish kinds, but not the words for 'sail', 'row' and 'harbor' – objects pertaining to navigation itself and a large part of sea fauna. This rather shows that Proto-Albanians were pushed away from coastal areas in early times (probably after the Latin conquest of the region) thus losing large parts (or the majority) of sea environment lexicon. A similar phenomenon could be observed with agricultural terms. While the words for 'arable land', 'corn', 'wheat', 'cereals', 'vineyard', 'yoke', 'harvesting', 'cattle breeding', etc. are native, the words for 'ploughing', 'farm' and 'farmer', agricultural practices, and some harvesting tools are foreign. This, again, points to intense contact with other languages and people, rather than providing evidence of a possible \"Urheimat\".\n\nThe centre of Albanian settlement remained the Mat river. In 1079, they were recorded farther south in the valley of the Shkumbin river. The Shkumbin, a seasonal stream that lies near the old Via Egnatia, is approximately the boundary of the primary dialect division for Albanian, Tosk and Gheg. The characteristics of Tosk and Gheg in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages are evidence that the dialectal split preceded the Slavic migration to the Balkans, which means that in that period (the 5th to 6th centuries AD), Albanians were occupying nearly the same area around the Shkumbin river, which straddled the Jireček Line.\n\nReferences to the existence of Albanian as a distinct language survive from the 14th century, but they failed to cite specific words. The oldest surviving documents written in Albanian are the \"formula e pagëzimit\" (Baptismal formula), \"Un'te paghesont' pr'emenit t'Atit e t'Birit e t'Spertit Senit\". (\"I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit\") recorded by Pal Engjelli, Bishop of Durrës in 1462 in the Gheg dialect, and some New Testament verses from that period.\n\nThe oldest known Albanian printed book, \"Meshari\", or \"missal\", was written in 1555 by Gjon Buzuku, a Roman Catholic cleric. In 1635 Frang Bardhi wrote the first Latin–Albanian dictionary. The first Albanian school is believed to have been opened by Franciscans in 1638 in Pdhanë.\n\nOne of the earliest dictionaries of Albanian language was written in 1693 which was an Italian language manuscript authored by Montenegrin sea captain Julije Balović \"Pratichae Schrivaneschae\" and includes a multilingual dictionary of hundreds of the most often used words in everyday life in the Italian, Slavo-Illirico, Greek, Albanian and Turkish languages.\n\nAlthough Albanian has been referred to as the \"weird sister\" for several words that do not correspond to IE cognates, it has retained many proto-IE features: for example, the demonstrative pronoun *\"*ḱo-\" is ancestral to Albanian \"ky/kjo\" and English \"he\" but not to English \"this\" or to Russian \"etot.\"\n\nAlbanian is compared to other Indo-European languages below, but note that Albanian has exhibited some notable instances of semantic drift (such as \"motër\" meaning \"sister\" rather than \"mother\".\n\nPhonologically, Albanian is not so conservative. Like many IE stocks, it has merged the two series of voiced stops (e.g. both *\"d\" and *\"dʰ\" became \"d\"). In addition, voiced stops tend to disappear in between vowels. There is almost complete loss of final syllables and very widespread loss of other unstressed syllables (e.g. \"mik\", 'friend' from Lat. \"amicus\"). PIE *\"o\" appears as \"a\" (also as \"e\" if a high front vowel \"i\" follows), while *\"ē\" and *\"ā\" become \"o\", and PIE *\"ō\" appears as \"e\". The palatals, velars, and labiovelars all remain distinct before front vowels, a conservation found otherwise in Luvian and related Anatolian languages. Thus PIE *\"ḱ\", *\"k\", and *\"kʷ\" become \"th\", \"q\", and \"s\", respectively (before back vowels *\"ḱ\" becomes \"th\", while *\"k\" and *\"kʷ\" merge as \"k\"). A minority of scholars reconstruct a fourth laryngeal phoneme *\"h\" which survives as as Alb. \"h\" word-initially (Albanian \"herdhe\", 'testicle' but Hittite \"arki-\" 'testicle', from PIE *h₄órǵʰiyeh₂). \n\nSince World War II, standard Albanian used in Albania has been based on the Tosk dialect. Kosovo and other areas where Albanian is official adopted the Tosk standard in 1969.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, Albanian writing developed in three main literary traditions: Gheg, Tosk, and Arbëreshë. Throughout this time, an intermediate subdialect spoken around Elbasan served as \"lingua franca\" among the Albanians, but was less prevalent in writing. The Congress of Manastir of Albanian writers held in 1908 recommended the use of the Elbasan subdialect for literary purposes and as a basis of a unified national language. While technically classified as a southern Gheg variety, the Elbasan speech is closer to Tosk in phonology and practically a hybrid between other Gheg subdialects and literary Tosk.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1918, the Albanian Literary Commission met in Shkodër under the leadership of Luigj Gurakuqi with the purpose of establishing a unified orthography for the language. The Commission, made up of representatives from the north and south of Albania, reaffirmed the Elbasan subdialect as the basis of a national tongue. The rules published in 1917 defined spelling for the Elbasan variety for official purposes. The Commission did not, however, discourage publications in one of the dialects, but rather laid a foundation for Gheg and Tosk to gradually converge into one.\n\nWhen the Congress of Lushnje met in the aftermath of World War I to form a new Albanian government, the 1917 decisions of the Literary Commission were upheld. The Elbasan subdialect remained in use for administrative purposes and many new writers embraced for creative writing. Gheg and Tosk continued to develop freely and interaction between the two dialects increased.\n\nAt the end of World War II, however, the new communist regime radically imposed the use of the Tosk dialect in all facets of life in Albania: administration, education, and literature. Most Communist leaders were Tosks from the south. Standardization was directed by the Albanian Institute of Linguistics and Literature of the Academy of Sciences of Albania. Two dictionaries were published in 1954: an Albanian language dictionary and a Russian–Albanian dictionary. New orthography rules were eventually published in 1967 and 1973 \"Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe\" (Orthography of the Albanian Language).\n\nUntil 1968, Kosovo and other Albanian-speaking areas in the former Yugoslavia followed the 1917 standard based on the Elbasan dialect. Albanian intellectuals in the former Yugoslavia consolidated the 1917 twice in the 1950s, culminating with a thorough codification of orthographic rules in 1964. The rules already provided for a balanced variety that accounted for both Gheg and Tosk dialects, but only lasted through 1968. Viewing divergences with Albania as a threat to their identity, Kosovars arbitrarily adopted the Tosk project that Tirana had published the year before. Although it was never intended to serve outside of Albania, the project became the \"unified literary language\" in 1972, when approved by a rubberstamp Orthography Congress. Only about 1 in 9 participants were from Kosovo. The Congress, held at Tirana, authorized the orthography rules that came out the following year, in 1973.\n\nMore recent dictionaries from the Albanian government are \"Fjalori Drejtshkrimor i Gjuhës Shqipe\" (1976) (Orthographic Dictionary of the Albanian Language) and \"Dictionary of Today's Albanian language\" (\"Fjalori Gjuhës së Sotme Shqipe\") (1980). Prior to World War II, dictionaries consulted by developers of the standard have included \"Lexikon tis Alvanikis glossis\" (Albanian: \"Fjalori i Gjuhës Shqipe\" (Kostandin Kristoforidhi, 1904), \"Fjalori i Bashkimit\" (1908), and \"Fjalori i Gazullit\" (1941).\n\nSince the fall of the communist regime, Albanian orthography has stirred heated debate among scholars, writers, and public opinion in Albania and Kosovo, with hardliners opposed to any changes in the orthography, moderates supporting varying degrees of reform, and radicals calling for a return to the Elbasan dialect. Criticism of Standard Albanian has centred on the exclusion of the 'me+' infinitive and the Gheg lexicon. Critics say that Standard Albanian disenfranchises and stigmatizes Gheg speakers, affecting the quality of writing and impairing effective public communication. Supporters of the Tosk standard view the 1972 Congress as a milestone achievement in Albanian history and dismiss calls for reform as efforts to \"divide the nation\" or \"create two languages.\" Moderates, who are especially prevalent in Kosovo, generally stress the need for a unified Albanian language, but believe that the 'me+' infinitive and Gheg words should be included. Proponents of the Elbasan dialect have been vocal, but have gathered little support in the public opinion. In general, those involved in the language debate come from diverse backgrounds and there is no significant correlation between one's political views, geographic origin, and position on Standard Albanian.\n\nMany writers continue to write in the Elbasan dialect but other Gheg variants have found much more limited use in literature. Most publications adhere to a strict policy of not accepting submissions that are not written in Tosk. Some print media even translate direct speech, replacing the 'me+' infinitive with other verb forms and making other changes in grammar and word choice. Even authors who have published in the Elbasan dialect will frequently write in the Tosk standard.\n\nIn 2013, a group of academics for Albania and Kosovo proposed minor changes to the orthography. Hardline academics boycotted the initiative, while other reformers have viewed it as well-intentioned but flawed and superficial. Media such as Rrokum and \"Java\" have offered content that is almost exclusively in the Elbasan dialect. Meanwhile, author and linguist Agim Morina has promoted \"Shqipe e Përbashkët\" or Common Albanian, a reformed version of the Tosk standard that aims at reflecting the natural development of the language among all Albanians. Common Albanian incorporates the 'me+' infinitive, accommodates for Gheg features, provides for dialect-neutral rules that favor simplicity, predictability, and usage trends. Many modern writers have embraced Common Albanian to various extents, especially in less formal writing. \n\nAlbanian is the medium of instruction in most Albanian schools. The literacy rate in Albania for the total population, age 9 or older, is about 99%. Elementary education is compulsory (grades 1–9), but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education.\n\nStandard Albanian has 7 vowels and 29 consonants. Like English, Albanian has dental fricatives (like the \"th\" in \"thin\") and (like the \"th\" in \"this\"), written as \"th\" and \"dh,\" which are rare cross-linguistically.\n\nGheg uses long and nasal vowels, which are absent in Tosk, and the mid-central vowel \"ë\" is lost at the end of the word. The stress is fixed mainly on the last syllable. Gheg \"n\" (\"femën\": compare English \"feminine\") changes to \"r\" by rhotacism in Tosk (\"femër\").\n\nNotes:\n\n\nAlthough the Indo-European schwa (\"ə\" or -\"h\"-) was preserved in Albanian, in some cases it was lost, possibly when a stressed syllable preceded it. Until the standardization of the modern Albanian alphabet, in which the schwa is spelled as \"ë\", as in the work of Gjon Buzuku in the 16th century, various vowels and gliding vowels were employed, including \"ae\" by Lekë Matrënga and \"é\" by Pjetër Bogdani in the late 16th and early 17th century. The schwa in Albanian has a great degree of variability from extreme back to extreme front articulation. Within the borders of Albania, the phoneme is pronounced about the same in both the Tosk and the Gheg dialect due to the influence of standard Albanian. However, in the Gheg dialects spoken in the neighbouring Albanian-speaking areas of Kosovo and Macedonia, the phoneme is still pronounced as back and rounded.\n\nAlbanian has a canonical word order of SVO (subject–verb–object) like English and many other Indo-European languages. Albanian nouns are inflected by gender (masculine, feminine and neuter) and number (singular and plural). There are five declensions with six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words, and the forms of the genitive and dative are identical (a genitive is produced when the prepositions \"i/e/të/së\" are used with the dative). Some dialects also retain a locative case, which is not present in standard Albanian. The cases apply to both definite and indefinite nouns, and there are numerous cases of syncretism.\n\nThe following shows the declension of \"mal\" (mountain), a masculine noun which takes \"i\" in the definite singular:\n\nThe following shows the declension of the masculine noun \"zog\" (bird), a masculine noun which takes \"u\" in the definite singular:\n\nThe following table shows the declension of the feminine noun \"vajzë\" (girl):\n\nThe definite article is placed after the noun as in many other Balkan languages, like in Romanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian.\n\n\nAlbanian has developed an analytical verbal structure in place of the earlier synthetic system, inherited from Proto-Indo-European. Its complex system of moods (six types) and tenses (three simple and five complex constructions) is distinctive among Balkan languages. There are two general types of conjugations.\n\nAlbanian verbs, like those of other Balkan languages, have an \"admirative\" mood (\"mënyra habitore\") that is used to indicate surprise on the part of the speaker or to imply that an event is known to the speaker by report and not by direct observation. In some contexts, this mood can be translated using English \"apparently\".\n\n\nFor more information on verb conjugation and on inflection of other parts of speech, see Albanian morphology.\n\nAlbanian word order is relatively free. To say 'Agim ate all the oranges' in Albanian, one may use any of the following orders, with slight pragmatic differences:\n\n\nHowever, the most common order is subject–verb–object, and negation is expressed by the particles \"nuk\" or \"s\"' in front of the verb, for example:\n\n\nHowever, the verb can optionally occur in sentence-initial position, especially with verbs in the non-active form (\"forma joveprore\"):\n\n\nIn imperative sentences, the particle \"mos\" is used for negation:\n\n\nThe earliest known texts in Albanian:\n\nIn 1967 two scholars claimed to have found a brief text in Albanian inserted into the Bellifortis text, a book written in Latin dating to 1402–1405.\n\nDr. Robert Elsie, a specialist in Albanian studies, considers that \"The Todericiu/Polena Romanian translation of the non-Latin lines, although it may offer some clues if the text is indeed Albanian, is fanciful and based, among other things, on a false reading of the manuscript, including the exclusion of a whole line.\"\n\nIn 1635, Frang Bardhi (1606–1643) published in Rome his \"Dictionarum latinum-epiroticum\", the first known Latin-Albanian dictionary. Other scholars who studied the language during the 17th century include Andrea Bogdani (1600–1685), author of the first Latin-Albanian grammar book, Nilo Katalanos (1637–1694) and others.\n\nAlbanian is known within historical linguistics as a case of a language which, although surviving through many periods of foreign rule and multilingualism, saw a \"disproportionately high\" influx of loans augmenting and replacing much of its vocabulary. Other languages influenced Albanian and high-end estimates classify the majority of Albanian vocabulary as loanwords, suggesting that more than 90% of the present Albanian vocabulary is Latin, Greek,Slavic, Italian and Turkish loanwords, with the biggest influence being Latin. The chief sources of (Proto-) Albanian are (Ancient) Greek, Latin and Slavic, while Ancient Greek loanwords are scarce the Latin loanwords are of extreme importance in phonology. The presence of loanwords from more well-studied languages from time periods before Albanian was attested, reaching deep back into the Classical Era, has been of great use in phonological reconstructions for earlier ancient and medieval forms of Albanian. Some words in the core vocabulary of Albanian have no known etymology linking them to Proto-Indo-European or any known source language, and as of 2018 are thus tentatively attributed to an unknown, unattested, pre-Indo-European substrate language; some words among these include \"zemër\" (heart) and \"hekur\" (iron). Some among these putative pre-IE words are thought to be related to putative pre-IE substrate words in neighboring Indo-European languages, such as \"lule\" (flower), which has been tentatively linked to Latin \"lilia\" and Greek \"leirion\"\n\nLexical distance of Albanian in a lexicostatistical analysis of the Ukrainian linguist Tyshchenko(the lower figure - the higher similarity): 49% Slovenian, 53% Romanian, 56% Greek, 82% French, 86% Macedonian, 86% Bulgarian.\n\n\nThere are some 30 Ancient Greek loanwords in Albanian. Many of these reflect a dialect which voiced its aspirants, as did the Macedonian dialect. Other loanwords are Doric; these words mainly refer to commodity items and trade goods and probably came through trade with a now-extinct intermediary.\n\nSome Gothic loanwords were borrowed through Late Latin, while others came from the Ostrogothic expansion into parts of Praevalitana around Nakšić and the Gulf of Kotor in Montenegro.\n\n\nIt is assumed that Greek and Balkan Latin (the ancestor of Romanian and other Balkan Romance languages) exerted a great influence on Albanian. Examples of words borrowed from Latin: \"qytet < civitas\" (city), \"qiell < caelum\" (sky), \"mik < amicus\" (friend).\n\nAfter the Slavs arrived in the Balkans, the Slavic languages became an additional source of loanwords. The rise of the Ottoman Empire meant an influx of Turkish words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish. Some Turkish personal names, such as \"Altin\", are common. There are some loanwords from Modern Greek, especially in the south of Albania. Many borrowed words have been replaced by words with Albanian roots or modern Latinized (international) words.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "676317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=676317", "title": "Bouyei language", "text": "Bouyei language\n\nThe Bouyei language (autonym: Haausqyaix also spelled \"Buyi\", \"Buyei\", or \"Puyi\"; , or \"\") is a language spoken by the Bouyei ethnic group of southern Guizhou Province in mainland China. Classified as a member of the Northern Tai group in the Tai languages branch of the Tai–Kadai language family, the language has over 2.5 million native speakers and is also used by the Giay people () in some parts of Vietnam. There are native speakers living in France or the United States as well, which emigrated from China or Vietnam. About 98% of the native speakers are in China.\n\nBouyei's characteristics are similar to the other members of its language branch. It is generally monosyllabic, and word order and particles are the main forms of grammar. Bouyei's syllable initials match up closely to the other Northern Tai languages, with relatively fast simplification and merging. Bouyei sentences can be shown to contain many different levels of phrasing.\n\nThe contemporary Bouyei script was developed after the abandonment of the Bouyei-Zhuang Script Alliance Policy in 1981, and was designed from 1981 to 1985. It is focused and phonologically representative, and takes the Wangmo County dialect as its foundation.\n\nAccording to a 1950s survey performed by the Chinese government, the Bouyei language as spoken in Guizhou can be divided into three general dialect groups (Snyder 2008). Note that Qián (黔) is an archaic Chinese designation for Guizhou.\n\n\nWu, Snyder, & Liang (2007) is the most comprehensive Bouyei survey to date, and covers the following data points.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Yei Zhuang varieties of Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan are closely related to the Bouyei varieties of Guizhou. Many other languages outside China with the names \"Yei\", \"Yay\", \"Yoy\", are also closely related.\n\nBouyei is also spoken in northern Vietnam, where it is known as Giáy. Edmondson and Gregerson (2001) has determined their language to be most similar to the Bouyei dialects of southwest Guizhou. The Giáy are an officially recognized group in Vietnam who now number nearly 50,000. Some household registries of the Giáy of Vietnam indicate that their ancestors had left Guizhou 160 years ago during the Qing Dynasty, and traveled overland to southern Yunnan and then Vietnam (Edmondson & Gregerson 2001). This coincides with the Miao Rebellion (1854–73) of Guizhou. The Giáy are found in the following locations of Vietnam.\n\n\nThe Giáy of Mường Khương District who call themselves Tudì [\"thu zi\"] can only speak a form of Chinese, and no Giáy. Their autonym comes from their ancestral place of origin, which is Duyun of Guizhou province, China. According to their household records, they had arrived in Maguan County and in Honghe Prefecture about 200 years ago. Similarly, some Giáy of Vietnam report that they have relatives still living in Hekou, Yunnan province, China (Edmondson & Gregerson 2001).\n\nThe Pu Nả people of Tam Đường District, Lai Châu Province, Vietnam call themselves the \"Vần Nả\" (with \"vần\" meaning 'people'), and number about 5,000 individuals (Lò 2012:11-20). They are also called \"Quý Châu\" (\"Guizhou\" 贵州), \"Sa Quý Châu\", \"Củi Chu\", \"Pu Y\", or \"Pâu Thìn\". The Pu Nả live in the following villages of Tam Đường District (Lò 2012:18).\n\n\nThe Yay language described by William J. Gedney is in fact the Giáy dialect of Mường Hum, Bát Xát District, Lào Cai (Edmondson & Gregerson 2001). There are also other related Northern Tai languages spoken in Vietnam as well, such Bố Y, Nhang, and Quy Châu (possibly closely related to Tai Mène of Laos). The Bố Y had originally came from around Wangmo County in southwestern Guizhou. Some subgroups of Bố Y call themselves the \"Pu Na\" or \"Pu Thin\", meaning 'people of the paddy field'.\n\nThe Bouyei script recognizes 32 consonants, with names formed by the consonant in an initial position followed by a long \"a\" vowel.\n\nPink: p, t, k, q, z, and c are used only to write Chinese loanwords.\n\nBeige: sl and hr are used for sounds that occur only in certain dialects.\n\nV is pronounced as a \"w\" before a \"u\".\n\nBouyei has 77 vowels and diphthongs.\n\nThe endings er [ɚ], ao [au], ou [əu], ia [ia], io [io], iao [iau], ua [ua], uai [uai], and ui [uəi] are used in writing Chinese loanwords.\n\nBouyei has six tones, corresponding to the eight \"sheng\" of Middle Chinese: all six in open syllables or with a final or , reduced to two \"entering\" tones with a final stop.\nMarking letters are placed at the end of syllables to indicate tone.\n\nBouyei shows de-voicing of Proto-Tai–Kadai's voiced consonants ( → , → , → ), and loss of aspiration.\n\nProto-Tai–Kadai's tones experienced a splitting into modern Bouyei, shown in the following table.\n\nAncient Bouyei writing was created by borrowing elements from Chinese characters or by mimicking their forms, and is similar to Sawndip.\n\nIn November 1956, a scientific conference was held in Guiyang to discuss the creation and implementation of a Latin-based alphabet for Bouyei. The result was a script similar some Zhuang romanizations that used the Longli County dialect as its base. The script was approved by the Chinese government and was put into use in 1957, though its use ceased in 1960.\n\nIn 1981 a conference on Bouyei history revised the script developed in 1956 in an attempt to make it more practical and phonologically representative of Wangmo County speech. It also was approved by the Chinese government, and was adopted on an experimental basis in 1982. Feedback was largely positive, and the script was officially brought into use in March 1985 and continues to be used to the present.\n\nOld and current Bouyei Romanization comparisons\n\nTone Marking Letters\n\n\n"}

She was brought up in western Wales in the little village Llanegryn, then in Merionethshire, where she learnt to write poetry as a child. She moved to Liverpool in 1840 but soon returned to Machynlleth not far from her home town. It was there that in 1850 she created the collection \"Telyn Egryn\" (Egryn's Harp), becoming the first woman ever to publish a secular Welsh-language book. Although she did not receive the same degree of attention as contemporary male poets, the work is considered to be a milestone in the history of women's literature in Wales. It presents a broad range of poetry covering bereavement, friendship, exile and depression, purposefully invoking an impression of the high moral standards enjoyed by Welsh women. Her poetry is closer to the work of 18th-century poets than to that of the Victorian poets who followed her in that she employed a level of language rooted in the pre-medieval period.\n\nAlso in 1850, in reaction to the publication of the Blue Books which severely criticized the loose morals and behaviour of Welsh women, Evan Jones (1820–1852) published \"Y Gymraes\" (The Welsh Women) which set out to defend the high principles of Welsh women. Elen Egryn contributed a poetic introduction to the first issue, in which she called for women to rise \"above shame and hateful mockery\" (\"goruwch gwarth a dirmyg cas\").\n\n"}

{"id": "38228585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38228585", "title": "Event cinema", "text": "Event cinema\n\nEvent cinema sometimes called alternative content cinema or livecasts refers to the use of cinema theaters to display a varied range of live and recorded entertainment excluding traditional films, such as sport, opera, musicals, ballet, music, one-off TV specials, current affairs, comedy and religious services. \nEvent Cinema was set up at the start of the century with rock concerts by Bon Jovi (2001), David Bowie (2003), and Robbie Williams (2005) bringing non-film audiences into cinemas that had newly installed digital equipment. The Metropolitan Opera in New York through their partnership with Fathom Events is acknowledged as the trailblazer in this area, aggressively seeking out new markets and setting high standards for live broadcasts via satellite. Emulated by other opera houses worldwide such as the Royal Opera House following a close second, Glyndebourne, La Scala and the Sydney Opera House the genre of opera within the 'Event Cinema' industry has been a huge success, and has brought new, younger audiences into cash-strapped opera houses depended on state funding and wealthy benefactors for the first time - an unforeseen and happy consequence of digitisation.\n\nBallet and theater have also been very successful, as have rock concerts, both live and recorded. The UK's National Theatre has been a huge success here with their season of live broadcasts under the banner 'NT Live', featuring big name casts such as Helen Mirren, whose recent turn as Queen Elizabeth II in The Audience was a sell out everywhere. (This was in partnership with another West End theatre and the NT are keen to help other theatres maximise their potential through live broadcasts). The Globe and the Royal Shakespeare Company are also producing work for live broadcast and recorded exhibition. As digitisation of cinemas matures, the Event Cinema industry is growing. The strongest territory is the US, followed by the UK and mainland European territories. Latin America is also a very strong market.\n\nRecent additions include Pompeii Live, a unique exhibition by the UK's British Museum, featuring celebrities and curators taking the audience on a live tour around the recreated set of Pompeii within the museum itself, and they are also exploring the schools market for the first time, following the live broadcast on June 18 with a daytime broadcast aimed at UK schools for the first time. If successful this will no doubt prove a model for future museums to emulate. Art galleries have already produced tours along these lines with the Royal Academy and the National Gallery both producing excellent tours along similar lines. \n\nAn added incentive for exhibitors is the ability to show alternative content, i.e. alternative to mainstream, studio-driven content, such as live special events, sports, pre-show advertising and other digital or video content. In industry terms this has become known as 'Alternative Content', but has recently become known more widely as 'Event Cinema'. \n\nSome low-budget films that would normally not have a theatrical release because of distribution costs might be shown in smaller engagements than the typical large release studio pictures. The cost of duplicating a digital \"print\" is very low, so adding more theaters to a release has a small additional cost to the distributor. Movies that start with a small release could scale to a much larger release quickly if they were sufficiently successful, opening up the possibility that smaller movies could achieve box office success previously out of their reach.\n\nEvent Cinema is also finding a market in 3rd world countries in which the higher costs and quality of DCI equipment are not yet affordable, as crucially there are no DCI specifications for Alternative Content as there is in mainstream [studio] content. This has led to an explosion in the variety of content on offer, but lack of standardisation has led to questionable quality at times. As the industry matures, this lack of regulation is expected to change and there are moves afoot to introduce codes of practice and technical specifications.\n\nRecorded content complements mainstream studio content by maximising the 'downtime' that plagues the cinema industry, where screens worldwide spend a large proportion of their time in darkness and cinemas empty. Some cinema chains have targeted pensioners in particular, offering free tea and coffee for afternoon matinees of recorded opera, for example. DCPs have been useful to cinemas not yet equipped with satellite broadcasting capability and has enabled exhibitors to build their Event Cinema audience, which is not generally the 18-24 demographic that multiplexes are targeting. \n\nEvent Cinema has seen a return of an older, affluent audience, previously turned off by the multiplex experience, and cinemas are starting to capitalise on this by offering waiter-serviced, high class finger food and alcoholic beverages, complete with bars and restaurants, a world away from the traditional popcorn/soft drink model; art house cinemas are increasingly marketing themselves as 'destination' venues for an evening's entertainment, somewhere to spend an entire evening, rather than just a couple of hours. As exhibition admissions have plateau'd in recent years due to the explosion in VOD, tablet and mobile content technology, this new revenue stream has been a surprise and welcome addition to the cinema industry, though the US studios have been cautious in embracing the change as yet.\n\nThe thrill of Live broadcasts means they are generally regarded as more popular than recorded events, but there are exceptions; artists with a loyal cult or teenage following tend to do particularly well in this area, as concert films featuring artists such as the Grateful Dead, Pearl Jam, JLS, Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones have shown.\n\nAs more and more distributors are emerging, offering an increasingly broad range of content to cinemas worldwide, the landscape itself is shifting: screen advertising companies, technical providers, and exhibitors themselves are reinventing themselves as Alternative Content or Event Cinema distributors, and the industry is witnessing a re-evaluation of business models and practices worldwide. Predictions are that this industry could be work in excess of US$1bn by 2015. An illustration of the growth of this industry is the news the establishment of a European trade association promoting the industry to the general public and supporting those involved in it and the Event Cinema Association.\n\n\n\n"}

It serves as an ethical foundation for hacking, and asserts that there is a point to hacking that supersedes selfish desires to exploit or harm other people, and that technology should be used to expand our horizons and try to keep the world free.\n\nWhen asked about his motivation for writing the article, Blankenship said, I was going through hacking withdrawal, and Craig/Knight Lightning needed something for an upcoming issue of Phrack. I was reading \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" and was very taken with the idea of revolution. At a more prominent public event, when asked about his arrest and motivation for writing the article, Blankenship said, I was just in a computer I shouldn’t have been. And [had] a great deal of empathy for my friends around the nation that were also in the same situation. This was post-WarGames, the movie, so pretty much the only public perception of hackers at that time was ‘hey, we’re going to start a nuclear war, or play tic-tac-toe, one of the two,’ and so I decided I would try to write what I really felt was the essence of what we were doing and why we were doing it.\n\nThe article is quoted several times in the 1995 movie \"Hackers\", although in the movie it is being read from an issue of the hacker magazine \"2600\", not the historically accurate \"Phrack\".\n\nThe Mentor gave a reading of \"The Hacker Manifesto\" and offered additional insight at H2K2.

However, in proper typesetting and graphic design, there are distinct characters for hyphens, dashes, and the minus sign. Usage of the hyphen-minus nonetheless persists in many contexts, as it is well-known, easy to enter on keyboards, and in the same location in all common character sets.\n\nMost programming languages, restricting themselves to 7-bit ASCII, use the hyphen-minus, rather than the Unicode character , for denoting subtraction and negative numbers.\n\nThe minus sign is nominally the same width as the plus sign. In proportional typefaces it is longer than a hyphen. During typesetting a word wrap may also occur following a hyphen-minus, unlike the minus sign proper which is treated as a mathematical symbol. These differences make \"-\" as a substitute for minus signs undesirable in professional typography.\n\nOn typewriters, it was conventional to use a pair of hyphens to represent an em dash, and this convention is still sometimes used in computer text.\n\nThe hyphen-minus is often used to represent an en dash, which may be used to indicate ranges (such as a time range of \"2000–2004\"), direction (as in \"The Los Angeles–London flight\"), and other cases of connection. The en dash is normally longer (the width of a letter \"n\") than a hyphen, though in a fixed-pitch or typewriter font there is no difference. The hyphen connects closely, the en dash less closely, while the em dash (the width of a letter \"m\") separates.\n\n"}

Such coins are popular among people seeking to invest in silver, particularly in small amounts. The word \"junk\" refers only to the value of the coins as collectibles and not to the actual condition of the coins; junk silver is not necessarily scrap silver.\n\nPrecious metals including silver are measured in troy ounces (ozt). A spot price for silver is the price for a troy ounce of silver which is 99.9-percent pure, or 999 fine. Silver coins including junk-silver coins have set silver-alloy contents ranging from 35-percent to 90-percent or more. The term \"coin silver,\" for example, refers to 90-percent silver alloy which was the most common alloy used to mint silver U.S. coins.\n\nAny combination of 90-percent silver U.S. coins which have a face value of US$1.00 contains 0.715 troy ounces of 99.9-percent silver (0.7234 troy ounces if uncirculated), except for the silver dollars (Morgan and Peace) which contain .7736 troy ounces of silver. In other words, a full troy ounce of 99.9-percent silver is contained in any combination of 90-percent silver U.S. coins which have a face value of US$1.40.\n\nThe most commonly collected junk-silver U.S. coins were minted before 1965 and include Morgan and Peace dollars; Liberty Head \"Barber,\" Walking Liberty, Franklin and Kennedy half dollars; Liberty Head \"Barber,\" Standing Liberty and Washington quarters; Liberty Head \"Barber,\" Winged Liberty Head \"Mercury\" and Roosevelt dimes; and Jefferson \"Wartime\" nickels.\n\nDollars\nHalf-Dollars\nQuarters\nDimes\nNickels\n\nThe most commonly collected junk-silver U.K. coins were minted before 1946 and include Edward VII, George V and George VI crowns; as well as Victoria, Edward VII, George V and George VI half crowns, florins, shillings, six pences, and three pences.\n\nCrowns\nHalf Crowns\nFlorins (2 Shillings)\nShillings\nSix Pences\nThree Pences\n\nCanadian dollar, half-dollar, quarter and dime coins minted after 1919 and before 1967 contained 80-percent silver. Those minted 1919 or earlier are sterling (92.5%) silver. For these coins (1920 - 1966), every CAD$1.00 in face value contains 0.6 troy ounces of silver. The 1967 quarter and dime were minted in either 80% or 50% silver. The 50% quarters and dimes continued part way through 1968 until the mint introduced the 100-percent nickel versions of all the coins mentioned beforehand. To tell the 1968 nickel and silver coins apart, the ones made from nickel are magnetic whereas the silver coins are not.\n\nAustralian \"pre-decimal\" florin, shilling, sixpence and threepence coins minted from 1910 to 1945 contained 92.5-percent silver. From 1946 to 1964, they were minted in \"post-silver\" coins which contained 50-percent silver. In 1966, the \"round\" 50-cent coin contained 80-percent silver.\n\nSwiss 1/2 Franken, 1 Franken and 2 Franken minted from 1874 to 1967 contained 83.5 percent silver. 5 Franken minted from 1922 to 1928 contained 90-percent silver and weighed 25g, and those minted between 1931-1969 contained 83.5 percent silver and weighed 15g.\n\nMany Mexican and other Central American countries made silver coins that are considered junk silver today.\n\nJunk-silver coins may be a desirable method of investing in silver for several reasons:\n\nFor these reasons, junk silver is popular among survivalists. In the event of a crisis or catastrophe during which traditional currency collapses, it is speculated that silver coins could provide a viable alternative, temporarily or indefinitely, while fiat currency, which is not backed by precious metals or other commodities, has no inherent value and can be subject to extreme inflation, even hyperinflation, similar to Weimar Germany, post-WWII Hungary and, more recently, Zimbabwe and Venezuela. Proponents of junk silver and other precious metals claim that, while fiat currencies have historically been subject to hyperinflation, precious metals will always have inherent value and can act as a medium of financial exchange when fiat currencies are obsolete.\n\nSome coin collectors and investors are also informally using the term \"junk copper\" to refer to any copper-bullion coins of no numismatic value. Prominent examples include U.S. pennies minted before 1982 (partial), Canadian pennies minted before 1997, and some pre-euro copper European coins. 154 junk-copper U.S. pennies contain a full pound of .950 fine copper.\n\n"}

{"id": "69304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69304", "title": "Lord", "text": "Lord\n\nLord is an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others acting like a master, a chief, or a ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom, or are entitled to courtesy titles. The collective \"Lords\" can refer to a group or body of peers.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the etymology of the word can be traced back to the Old English word \"hlāford\" which originated from \"hlāfweard\" meaning \"loaf-ward\" or \"bread keeper\", reflecting the Germanic tribal custom of a chieftain providing food for his followers. The appellation \"lord\" is primarily applied to men, while for women the appellation \"lady\" is used. However, this is no longer universal: the Lord of Mann, a title currently held by the Queen of the United Kingdom, and female Lord Mayors are examples of women who are styled Lord.\n\nUnder the feudal system, \"lord\" had a wide, loose and varied meaning. An overlord was a person from whom a landholding or a manor was held by a mesne lord or vassal under various forms of feudal land tenure. The modern term \"landlord\" is a vestigial survival of this function. A liege lord was a person to whom a vassal owed sworn allegiance. Neither of these terms were titular dignities, but rather factual appellations, which described the relationship between two or more persons within the highly stratified feudal social system. For example, a man might be Lord of the Manor to his own tenants but also a vassal of his own overlord, who in turn was a vassal of the King. Where a knight was a lord of the manor, he was referred to in contemporary documents as \"John (Surname), knight, lord of (manor name)\". A feudal baron was a true titular dignity, with the right to attend Parliament, but a feudal baron, Lord of the Manor of many manors, was a vassal of the King.\n\nThe substantive title of \"Lord of the Manor\" came into use in the English medieval system of feudalism after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The title \"Lord of the Manor\" was a titular feudal dignity which derived its force from the existence and operation of a manorial court or court baron at which he or his steward presided. To the tenants of a manor their lord was a man who commanded on occasion the power of exercising capital punishment over them. The term invariably used in contemporary mediaeval documents is simply \"lord of X\", X being the name of the manor. The term \"Lord of the Manor\" is a recent usage of historians to distinguish such lords from feudal barons and other powerful persons referred to in ancient documents variously as \"Sire\" (mediaeval French), \"Dominus\" (Latin), \"Lord\" etc. The title of \"Lord of the Manor\" is recognised by the British Government, in the form of Her Majesty's Land Registry, as one of three elements of a manor that can affect Land Registry. Modern legal cases have been won by persons claiming rights as lords of the manor over village greens. The heads of many ancient English land-owning families have continued to be lords of the manor of lands they have inherited. \n\nThe UK Identity and Passport Service will include such titles on a British passport as an \"observation\" (e.g., 'The Holder is the Lord of the Manor of X'), provided the holder can provide documentary evidence of ownership, as will Passport Canada. The United States however, forbids the use of all titles on passports. Australia forbids the use of titles on passports if those titles have not been awarded by the Crown (in reference to the Australian Monarchy) or the Commonwealth (in reference to the Australian Government).\n\nThe Scottish title Laird is a shortened form of 'laverd' which is an old Scottish word deriving from an Anglo-Saxon term meaning 'Lord' and is also derived from the middle English word 'Lard' also meaning 'Lord'. The word is generally used to refer to any owner of a landed estate and has no meaning in heraldic terms and its use is not controlled by the Lord Lyon.\n\n\"Lord\" is used as a generic term to denote members of the peerage. Five ranks of peer exist in the United Kingdom: in descending order these are duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. The appellation \"Lord\" is used most often by barons, who are rarely addressed by their formal and legal title of \"Baron\". The correct style is 'The Lord (X)': for example, Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, is commonly known as \"The Lord Tennyson\". Marquesses, earls and viscounts are commonly also addressed as Lord. Dukes use the style \"The Duke of (X)\", and are not correctly referred to as 'Lord (X)'. Dukes are formally addressed as 'Your Grace', rather than 'My Lord'. In the Peerage of Scotland, the members of the lowest level of the peerage have the substantive title 'Lord of Parliament' rather than Baron.\n\n\"Lord\" is also used as a courtesy title for some or all of the children of senior members of the peerage: for example the younger sons of dukes and marquesses are entitled to use the style \"Lord (first name) (surname)\". As these titles are merely courtesy titles, the holder is not by virtue of the title a member of the peerage and is not entitled to use the definite article 'The' as part of the title. Sons of British Princes, would also use a similar style if the holder doesn't have a peerage.\n\nThe upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is the House of Lords, which is an abbreviation of the full title, The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled. The Lords Temporal are the people who are entitled to receive writs of summons to attend the House of Lords in right of a peerage. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Winchester and Durham, and the twenty-one longest-serving bishops of the Church of England from among the other bishops, who are all entitled to receive writs of summons in right of their bishoprics or archbishoprics. \n\nThe Lords Temporal greatly outnumber the Lords Spiritual, there being nearly 800 of the former and only 26 of the latter. As of December 2016, 92 Lords Temporal sit in the House in right of hereditary peerages and 19 sit in right of judicial life peerages under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. The rest are life peers under the Life Peerages Act 1958.\n\nUntil the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (early 21st century), certain judges sat in the House of Lords by virtue of holding life peerages. They were known collectively as the Law Lords. Those Law Lords who had held the office of Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom lost the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords, despite retaining their life peerages, upon creation of the Supreme Court. The appellation \"Lord\" is also used to refer to some judges in certain Commonwealth legal systems, who are not peers. Some such judges, for instance judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, are called \"Lord Justice\". Other Commonwealth judges, for example judges of Canadian provincial supreme courts, are known only as Justices but are addressed with deference in court as 'My Lord', 'My Lady', 'Your Lordship' or 'Your Ladyship'.\n\nExamples of judges who use the appellation \"lord\" include:\n\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, and in most countries that are members or former members of the Commonwealth, bishops may be addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lord Bishop\" or \"Your Lordship\", particularly on formal occasions. This usage is not restricted to those bishops who sit in the House of Lords. Indeed, by custom, it is not restricted to bishops of the Church of England but applies to bishops of the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church and the Roman Catholic Church, and may be applied (though less commonly) to bishops of other Christian jurisdictions. However, in modern times, it has become more common to use simply the one word \"Bishop\". \n\nIn the United States, bishops are addressed as \"Excellency\".\n\nVarious other high offices of state in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland are prefixed with the deferential appellation of \"lord\" such as Lord Chancellor, Lord Privy Seal, Lord President of the Council and Lord Mayor. Holders of these offices are not \"ex officio\" peers, although the holders of some of the offices were in the past always peers.\n\nIn most cultures in Europe an equivalent appellation denoting deference exists. The French term \"Mon Seigneur\" (\"My Lord\"), shortened to the modern French \"Monsieur\" derives directly from the Latin \"seniorem\", meaning \"elder, senior\". From this Latin source derived directly also the Italian \"Signore\", the Spanish \"Señor\", the Portuguese \"Senhor\".\n\nNon-Romance languages have their own equivalents. Of the Germanic family there is the Dutch \"Meneer/Mijnheer/De Heer\" (as in: \"aan de heer Joren Jansen\"), German \"Herr\", and Danish \"Herre\". All three of these stem from a Germanic title of respect (in this case, from the Proto-Germanic root \"*haira-\", \"hoary, venerable, grey\", likely a loan translation of Latin \"seniorem\"). \nIn other European languages there is Welsh \"Arglwydd\", Hungarian \"Úr\", Greek \"Kyrie\", Polish \"Pan\", Czech \"pán\", Breton \"Aotrou\", Albanian \"Zoti\".\n\nIn several Indian languages there are have: Hindi \"Swami\", \"Prabhu\", \"Samprabhu\"(Overlord) also words like \"Saheb\" or \"Laat Saheb\" from \"Lord Saheb\" were once used but have changed in meaning now, Telugu \"Prabhuvu\", Tamil \"Koman\", Kannada \"Dore\", Bengali \"Probhu\", Gujarati \"Swami\", Punjabi \"Su'āmī\", Nepali \"Prabhu\". Words like \"Swami\" and \"Prabhu\" are Sanskrit-origin words, common in many Indian languages.\n\nPhilippine languages have different words for \"lord\", some of which are cognates. Tagalog has \"Panginoón\" for \"lord\" in both the noble and the religious senses. Its root, \"ginoo\", is also found in Visayan languages like Cebuano as the term for \"lord\". \"Ginoo\" is also the Tagalog root for \"Ginoóng\", the modern equivalent of the English term \"Mister\" (akin to how Romance language terms like \"señor\" may be glossed as either \"lord\", \"mister\", or \"sir\"). Ilocano meanwhile employs \"Apo\" for \"Lord\" in religious contexts; it is a particle that generally accords respect to an addressee of higher status than the speaker.\n\n\"Lord\" is used as a title of deference for various gods or deities. The earliest recorded use of \"Lord\" in the English language in a religious context was by English Bible translators such as Bede. However, Bede wrote in Latin, and was described by Michael Lapidge as \"without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period\". He used an Anglo-Saxon phrase that indicated a noble, prince, ruler or lord to refer to God; however, he applied this as a gloss to the Latin text that he was producing, and not as a clear translation of the term itself. \"Lord\", as a gloss to Old English , meant royal, ruler, prince, noble, and did not indicate a deity. After the Norman invasion and the influx of French Catholics, this understanding began to be applied to religious texts as well, but that was during the later Middle Ages and not the early medieval period of Bede's time. It was widely used in the King James Bible translated in the 17th century. See also Jesus is Lord.\n\n"}

In some countries, postage stamps have been issued specifically for official mail.\n\nOfficial stamps were intended for the same purpose as regular postage stamps except that they were unavailable for purchase at post offices. While most stamps are denominated some have no value imprint.\n\nSome of the earliest official mail were the messages sent by kings, emperors and other rulers. The Cursus publicus was the official mail courier (and transportation) system created by the Roman Emperor, Augustus. Much later, one of the functions of the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post postal system was to carry the mail of Emperor Maximilan I in the Holy Roman Empire.\nOfficial mail stamps are related to the end of franking privilege that granted certain elected officials of a government the privilege to send mail for free. The person usually signed their name on the mail but it was a highly abused system. In the UK the rules were changed requiring the sender to indicate the date and place of mailing in addition to their signature, but this too was abused and this led, in part, to the introduction of postage stamps.\n\nMost governments use envelopes with an indicia indicating its official status; the United Kingdom's official mail most often shows, O.H.M.S. or On His/Her Majesty's Service, the United States uses the silhouette of an eagle, Ethiopia shows a hand holding a cleft stick with a letter is wedged into it, while Ireland uses a harp.\n\nAfter the civil war, the United States Post Office Department had a large deficit and according to the Postmaster General's 1869 report 31,933 had the franking privilege at an estimated cost of $5 million, so in 1872 the Republican party included a proposal to eliminate the free frank as part of their election platform. Between 1873 and 1891 there was no free franking in the USA because special official mail stamps had been issued, but by 1891 free franking had been restored.\n\nThe first official mail postage stamp, known as the VR official, was issued by the United Kingdom at the same time as the Penny Black and Two pence blue. The VR Official utilised the same design as the Penny Black except that the stars in the top corners were removed and replaced by the letters V and R that gives the stamp its common name. On May 7, 1840, W.L. Maberly, Secretary to the British post office, sent a notice to all postmasters to which was affixed a pair of VR specimens as well as a pair of two penny blues. The notice charged the postmasters to note the letters in the upper corners of the stamp that was to be: \"applied to the correspondence of Public Departments, and other Persons formerly enjoying the privilege of Official Franking.\"\n\nLegislation passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1873 stated that: \"the Postmaster General shall cause to be prepared a special stamp or stamped envelope, to be used only for official mail matter for each of the executive departments\", to this end, the official stamps were issued on July 1, 1873 for the Executive Branch and the departments of \"Agriculture\", the \"Interior\", \"Justice\", \"Navy\", \"Post Office\", \"Treasury\" and \"War\" following the ending of the franking privilege though the stamps were only in use for seven years mainly due to the need for departmental postage accountability. The Post Office also printed official stamped envelopes for their own use.\n\nIn March 1877 the stamps became unnecessary, because a congressional act permitted government departments to provide their own envelopes endorsed \"Official Business\". Private use of the envelopes had a fine of $300. The official stamps were officially discontinued June 30, 1879, but they were in use until they were exhausted. The stamps and envelopes were finally abolished on July 5, 1884, however, for a four-year period between 1910–1914 official stamps were used for the postal savings program.\n\nThe first US stamps to have the words \"Official Mail\" printed on them were issued on January 12, 1983 when the departmental postage accountability again became a concern. The Great Seal of the United States became the central design on these 20¢ stamps and envelopes. A 32¢ stamp and envelope superseded the 20¢ issue in 1995.\n\nSeveral countries, such as, Australia, Canada, New South Wales, New Zealand and Niue, have issued official stamps that can often be identified because they bear the words like, \"official,\" \"service,\" \"dienstmark,\" or the initials \"O.S.\" (Official service) or OHMS (On Her/His Majesty's Service) in the design, as an overprint, or a perfin. Even Tibet had official postage stamps around 1950.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}
{"id": "26922673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26922673", "title": "Open discourse", "text": "Open discourse\n\nOpen Discourse is a technical term used in discourse analysis and Sociolinguistics and is commonly contrasted with \"Closed Discourse\". The concept of open and closed discourse is associated with the overlay of open and closed discourse communities and open and closed communication events. Keys to determining whether a discourse is open or closed include access to information, equity of access, open access, quality of discourse and mechanisms and modalities of discourse control: overt, covert, implicit and incidental. As a conceptual filter and cultural construct, ideology is a function and mechanism of discourse control. Channel and signal of a communication event and register of communication together control discourse and therefore, determine the degree of social inclusion and social exclusion and, by extension, the relative efficiency of that communication event. Open and closed discourse operate along a continuum where absolute closure and complete openness are theoretically untenable due to noise in the channel. The nature of the channel, signal, code, replicability, recording, transmissibility, cataloguing, recall or other variable of a communication event and its information control and context of transmission-as-event, impact its relative position along the continuum between open and closed discourse. In all cases, open discourse is assumed to be sustained discourse.\n\nVan Dijk (c.2003: p. 357) holds that:\n\"Although most discourse control is contextual or global, even local details of meaning, form, or style may be controlled, e.g. the details of an answer in class or court, or choice of lexical items or jargon in courtrooms, classrooms or newsrooms (Martin Rojo 1994).\n\nIn regards to the Internet as cultural artifact and information as complex adaptive system with emergent properties of open discourse such as weblogs and social media, Boyd (February 2009) holds that:\n\"The Web is the most important and valuable human artifact ever created. And, it is not owned by any single group, government, company, or person. It is not patented, no one is in charge, and we have no idea whatsoever as to how much we have invested in it, or even how much it costs us to keep it running... The Web – and in particular the rise of the so-called blogosphere – has led to a resurgence of open public discourse that is unparalleled since the emergence of independent newspapers and pamphleteers at the outset of the Industrial revolution. The Web has grown from a handful of websites to millions of individuals and organizations publishing on every conceivable topic from every imaginable perspective.\"\n\nOpen discourse as living document may also be understood as the open-endedness in both a communication event and the inability to collapse a communication event into definitives, the unequivocal import of a cultural artifact and the associated inability to resolve ambiguity due to noise and ever-changing context and audience, as Graham (2000: p. 5) further states:\n...I understand the play on multiplicity of interpretation and open‐endedness that ambiguity signifies however, the term ambiguous is itself ambiguous – it not only means “open to various interpretations” but also “of doubtful and uncertain nature; difficult to understand” and “lacking clearness or definiteness, obscure” (Macquarie Essential Dictionary, 1999: 23).\n\nDayton (2006) frames the transition from open access to open discourse in the Internet discourse community in regards to the parameters of scientific publishing thus:\n\"The [I]nternet is expanding the realm of scientific publishing to include free and open public debate of published papers. Journals are beginning to support web posting of comments on their published articles and independent organizations are providing centralized web sites for posting comments about any published article. The trend promises to give one and all access to read and contribute to cutting edge scientific criticism and debate.\" NB: proper noun of 'Internet' repaired from the error 'internet'.\n\nTer Borg and Dijking (1995) explore discourse control in relation to urban planning, urban development, public participation and stakeholder engagement in their analysis of two case studies.\n\nDawson & Taylor (1998) have documented experiential learnings of the logistics of open and critical discourse in the discourse community of the science classroom.\n\nIn framing the relationship between the discourse community of a classroom and therefore pedagogical discourse throughout all media and associating open discourse to a democratic ideology Celce-Murcia & Olshtain (2000: p. 11) hold that:\n\"...it is important that teachers understand what critical discourse analysis is and that they are at the very least sensitized to the potentially discriminatory and demeaning discourse that may arise in the classroom and in teaching materials and be prepared to deal with it constructively (i.e., to use such instances of discourse as opportunities for discussions and activities that can make the language classroom a more democratic and open discourse community).\"\n\n"}

The English phrase is also given the abbreviation PBUH in English-language writing. An extended variant of the phrase reads \"\" () [lit.] \"blessings of God be upon him and his family and peace\", and it is often abbreviated \"SAW\" or \"SAWS\" in writing, even in English. The Arabic phrase is given the name ṣalawāt. The phrase is encoded as a ligature at Unicode code point \n\nSome Islamic scholars have voiced disagreement with the practice of abbreviating these phrases, arguing that it demonstrates laziness and a lack of respect.\n\n\nWhen mentioning the Sahabah (the companions, disciples, scribes and family of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), \"raḍiya llāhu ʿanhu\" (for males) and \"raḍiya 'llāhu ʿanha\" (for women) are used by Sunnis; they mean, \"May God be pleased with him or her,\" respectively. These have often been abbreviated \"RA\". The phrase is sometimes also used after mentioning other names, including those of Jesus and Moses, but the term عليه سلام \"ʿalayhi salām\", \"On him be peace,\" is more common in such cases.\n\nIn the translation of the meanings of the Qurʾān in \"Surah\" (chapter) 33 entitled \"Al-Ahzab\" (The Confederates), \"ayah\" (verse) 56:\n\nThe Islamic scholar, ibn Kathir, titled the section in his \"tafsir\" (i.e., explanation of the Qurʾān), the \"Tafsir ibn Kathir\", regarding this verse, \"The Command to say Salah upon the Prophet (Muhammad)\".\n\nThis point is further founded in the saying by Muhammad that, This was recorded by Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his \"Musnad\".\n\nThe evidence for sending salat on Muhammad is not limited to the Qurʾān.

{"id": "8296018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8296018", "title": "Pohnpeian language", "text": "Pohnpeian language\n\nPohnpeian, is a Micronesian language spoken as the indigenous language of the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. Pohnpeian has approximately 30,000 (estimated) native speakers living in Pohnpei and its outlying atolls and islands with another 10,000-15,000 (estimated) living off island in parts of the US mainland, Hawaii and Guam. It is the second-most widely spoken native language of the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nPohnpeian features a \"high language\" including some specialized vocabulary, used in speaking about people of high rank.\n\nPohnpeian is most closely related to the Chuukic languages of Chuuk (formerly Truk). Ngatikese, Pingelapese and Mwokilese of the Pohnpeic languages are closely related languages to Pohnpeian. Pohnpeian shares 81% lexical similarity with Pingelapese, 75% with Mokilese, and 36% with Chuukese.\n\nPohnpeian employs a great deal of loanwords from colonial languages such as English, Japanese, Spanish, and German. However, these \"loanwords\" are neither spelled or pronounced the same as the source language.\n\nThe modern Pohnpeian orthography uses twenty letters — sixteen single letters and four digraphs — collated in a unique order:\n\nAs German missionaries designed an early form of the orthography, Pohnpeian spelling uses -h to mark a long vowel, rather like German: dohl 'mountain'. The IPA equivalents of written Pohnpeian are as follows:\n\nPohnpeian phonotactics generally allow syllables of consisting of consonants (C) and vowels (V) accordingly: V, VC, CV, CVC. This basic system is complicated by Pohnpeian orthographical conventions and phonological processes. Orthographically, \"i\" is used to represent <nowiki>/</nowiki>j/, though it is often unwritten; \"-u\" is realized as <nowiki>/</nowiki>w/; and \"h\" indicates a long vowel (inherited from German). Thus, \"sahu\" is pronounced [sʲa:w], never [sʲahu]. Consecutive vowels are glided with [j] or [w], depending on the relative height and order of the vowels: \"diar\" is said [tijar] (\"to find\"); \"toai\" is [ ̻tɔji] (\"to have a runny nose\"); \"suwed\" is [sʲuwɛt] (\"bad\"); and \"lou\" is [lowu] (\"cooled\"). While the glide [j] is never written other than as \"i\" the glide [w] may be written between \"u\" and a non-high vowel: \"suwed\" (\"bad\").\n\nWords beginning in nasal consonant clusters may be pronounced as written, or with a leading prothetic vowel. The roundedness of the prothetic vowel depends on that of the adjacent consonant cluster and the first written syllable. For example, \"nta\" can be said [i ̻n ̻ta] (\"blood\"), and \"ngkapwan\" may be [iŋkapʷan] (\"a while ago\"); but \"mpwer\" is optionally [umʷpʷɛr] (\"twin\"), and \"ngkopw\" may be [uŋkopʷ] (a species of crab). Pohnpeian orthography renders the consonant clusters [mʷpʷ] and [mʷmʷ] as \"mpw\" and \"mmw\", respectively.\n\nFurther phonological constraints frequently impact the pronunciation and spelling of consonant clusters, triggered variously by reduplication and assimilation into neighboring sounds. Sound changes, especially in reduplication, are often reflected by a change in spelling. However, processes triggered by affixes as well as adjacent words are not indicated in spelling. In order to inflect, derive, and pronounce Pohnpeian words properly, the order of operations must generally begin with liquid assimilation, followed by nasal assimilation, and end with nasal substitution.\n\nFirst, liquid assimilation is seen most often in reduplication alongside spelling changes. By this process, liquids /l/ and /r/ are assimilated into the following alveolar (coronal) consonant: \"nur\" > \"nunnur\" (\"contract\").\n\nThe second process, nasal assimilation, presents two varieties: partial and complete. In partial nasal assimilation, /n/ assimilates with a following stop consonant to produce [mp], [mʷpʷ], [mm], [mʷmʷ], or [ŋk]. For example, the prefix \"nan-\" (\"in\") produces: \"nanpar\", pronounced [nampar] (\"trade wind season\"); \"nanpwungara\", said [namʷpʷuŋara] (\"between them\"); and \"nankep\", said [naŋkep] (\"inlet\"). Partial assimilation also occurs across word boundaries: \"kilin pwihk\" is pronounced [kilimʷ pʷiːk]. The allophone of /n/ is written \"n\" in these cases.\n\nIn complete nasal assimilation, /n/ assimilates into adjacent liquid consonants to produce /ll/ or /rr/: \"lin + linenek\" > \"lillinenek\" (\"oversexed,\" spelling change from reduplication); \"nanrek\" is said [narrɛk] (\"season of plenty\"). Complete nasal assimilation also occurs across word boundaries: \"pahn lingan\" is said [paːlliŋan] (\"will be beautiful\").\n\nThe third process, nasal substitution, also presents two varieties. Both varieties of nasal substitution affect adjacent consonants of the same type: alveolar (coronal), bilabial, or velar. The first variety is often triggered by reduplication, resulting in spelling changes: \"sel\" is reduplicated to \"sensel\" (\"tired\").\n\nThe second variety of nasal substitution, limited to bilabial and velar consonants, occurs across word and morpheme boundaries: \"kalap pahn\" is pronounced [kalam pahn] (\"always will be\"); \"Soulik kin soupisek\" is pronounced [souling kin soupisek] (\"Soulik is [habitually] busy\"). This second variety of the nasal substitution process is phonemically more productive than the first: it includes all results possible in the first variety, as well as additional cluster combinations, indicated in green below. Some alveolar pairs produce an intervening vowel, represented as V below. Not all clusters are possible, and not all are assimilative, however.\n\nBy following the order of operations, reduplication of the word \"sel\" (\"tired\") progresses thus: *\"selsel\" > *\"sessel\" (liquid assimilation) > \"sensel\" (nasal substitution). In this case, the same result is achieved by nasal substitution alone.\n\nPohnpeian word order is nominally SVO. Depending on the grammatical function, the head may come before or after its dependents. Like many Austronesian languages, Pohnpeian focus marking interacts with transitivity and relative clauses (see Austronesian alignment). Its range of grammatically acceptable sentence structures is more generally (1) noun phrase, (2) verb phrase (3) other noun phrases, where the contents of the leading noun phrase may vary according to the speaker's focus. If the leading noun phrase is not the subject, it is followed by the focus particle \"me\". Normally, the object phrase is last among predicates:\n\nHonorific speech is used in several settings as a way of showing honor and respect to older ones, those who have been assigned titles, royalty, and in almost all religious settings. Depending on the second or third person, a given sentence may vary widely because honorific speech comprises a separate vocabulary, including all parts of speech and topics both lofty and mundane. Examples include: \"pohnkoiohlap\" (to eat with the \"nahnmwarki\"), \"likena\" (high chief's wife), \"pahnkupwur\" (chest; normally \"mwarmware\"), \"pahnpwoal\" (armpit; normally \"pahnpeh\"), \"dauso\" (anus, normally \"pwoar\"), \"kelipa\" (to joke, normally \"kamwan\"), \"kaluhlu\" (to vomit), and \"keipweni\" (an interjection). Although at times in the absence of a specific honorific word, the word \"Ketin\" is often used to indicate that the proceeding verb is honoric (\"Koht kin ketin kapikada\" would translate to \"God creates\"). The word \"Ketin\" has no meaning by itself. However, when used as a prefix, it is a sure way to distinguish honorific speech (\"Kiong\" has the meaning of \"Give\", \"Ketkiong\" would be the honorific version of the same word)\n\nNouns may be singular, dual, or plural in number, and generally inflect by suffixing. Numerals usually follow the nouns they count, and agree in noun class. Groups of nouns and adjectives comprise noun phrases. Pohnpeian transitive sentences contain up to three noun phrases.\n\nInalienable, or direct, possession is marked by personal suffixes. Other forms of possession are indicated through possessive classifiers. The construct suffix \"-n\" appears in oblique positions, such as possessive phrases. Words ending in \"n\", however, are followed by the clitic \"en\". Possessive phrases generally add this construct state to a classifier noun, followed by the possessor, and lastly the possessum. For example: \"weren ohlo war\" (-n that-man canoe) means \"that man's canoe.\"\n\nSome possessive classifiers, namely \"ah\" and \"nah\", may precede the possessum: \"nein ohlo (nah) rasaras\" (-n that-man [] saw) means \"that man's saw.\" Possessive classifiers can also occur with more than one following noun. The classifier itself may give a particular meaning to the possessum: \"pwihk\" means \"pig;\" \"nah pwihk\" means \"his (live) pig;\" \"ah pwihk\" means \"his (butchered) pig;\" and \"kene pwihk\" means \"his pig (to eat).\"\n\nDeterminers in Pohnpeian may occurs as enclitics which are bound morphemes or independent words and occur in three basic types: demonstrative modifiers, pointing demonstratives, and demonstrative pronouns. All of the determiners have a three-way diectic distinction of proximal (near the speaker), medial (near the listener), and distal (away from both the speaker and listener), as well as an emphatic/non-emphatic distinction. Demonstratives are generally, suffixed to or following the last word of a noun phrase. Orthographically singular clitics are suffixed to the word, while plurals are written as separate words.\n\nDemonstrative modifiers occur as enclitics with nouns and always occupy the last element in a noun phrase.\n\nThe singular emphatic demonstrative modifiers are formed by suffixing the non-emphatic singular forms to appropriate numeral classifier for the noun, such as \"men-\" for animate nouns. The plural forms are always constructed by suffixing the non-emphatic plural form to \"pwu-\" regardless of the singular classifier.\n\nExamples of the demonstrative modifiers in use are\n\nPointing modifiers are determiners that can stand alone in a noun phrase and are used in equational (non-verbal) sentences. They can also occur by themselves as one word sentences. They have both non-emphatic and emphatic forms.\n\nExample uses of pointing modifiers:\n\nDemonstrative pronouns are determiners that can replace noun phrases in a verbal sentence. They have both non-emphatic and emphatic forms.\n\nExamples of demonstrative pronouns in use:\n\nThe relative pronoun \"me\" means \"one who is\" or \"which,\" and is used with adjectives and general verbs: \"Ih me kehlail\" (He one strong > He is the strong one); \"Ih me mwenge\" (He one eat > He is the one who ate).\n\nPossessive classifiers are used frequently and differentiate among person, possessum, and honorific usage. Their personal forms appear below:\n\nFurther possessive classifiers include: \"sapwellime\" (third person honorific), \"were\" (vehicles, canoes), \"nime\" (drinkable things), \"imwe\" (buildings, homes), \"ulunge\" (pillows), \"sapwe\" (land), \"kie\" (things to sleep on), \"tie\" (earrings), \"mware\" (garlands, titles, names), \"ipe\" (covers, sheets), \"kene\" (edibles), and \"seike\" (catch of fish).\n\nSpecialized kinship classifiers include: \"kiseh\" (relatives), \"sawi\" (clan members), \"rie\" (sibling in Crow kinship), \"wahwah\" (man's sister-relation's children), and \"toki\" (persons with whom one has had sexual intercourse).\n\nHonorifics comprise a largely separate vocabulary.\n\nNumbers normally follow the nouns they count, however they may be pre-posed in certain situations. Numbers and measure words depend on the grammatical class and physical characteristics of the object being counted. The several number systems are grouped by linguists into three sets, reflecting their term for \"ten.\" When naming numbers in order, natives most often use the –\"u\" class. \"Ngoul\" is an alternate word for \"ten\" for \"-pak\" and \"-sou\" classifiers.\n\nHigher numerals such as \"pwiki\" \"hundred\", \"kid\" \"thousand\", do not inflect for noun class. The –\"ehd\" system, above is likewise not class-based.\n\nOrdinals are formed with the prefix \"ka–\", pronounced as \"ke–\" in certain words.\n\nPohnpeian distinguishes between intransitive and transitive verbs. Transitive verbs are those with both a subject and an object. Intransitive verbs indicate most other verbal, adjectival, and adverbial relationships. Within verb phrases, aspect markers are followed by adverbs, and lastly the main verb.\n\nMany, if not most, transitive and intransitive verbs share common roots, though their derivation is often unpredictable. Some thematic features among intransitive verbs include ablaut, reduplication, the suffix \"-ek\", and the prefix \"pV\", where V stands for any vowel. Thematic suffixes among transitive verbs include \"-ih\" and \"-VC\", where C stands for any consonant. Some transitive verbs also end in a final short vowel.\n\nPohnpeian indicates four grammatical aspects: unrealized, habitual, durative, and perfective. Alternations in vowel length, as well as ablaut, are a salient feature of the aspect paradigm.\n\nPohnpeian permits relative clauses and conjoined clauses through use of conjunctions and conjunctive adverbs. The language also permits verbs within nominal clauses as gerundive clauses, finite clauses, and infinitive clauses.\n\nPohnpeian verbs allow for a high level of affixation. The allowable suffixes and their ordering is presented in the table below.\n\nPohnpeian intransitive verbs can be divided into the following types:\nThere are five verbal prefixes, which appear as bound morphemes: the causative \"ka-\", the negatives \"sa-\" and \"sou-\", and two other semantic modifiers \"ak-\" and \"li-\".\n\n\"Ka-\", the causative prefix, makes intransitive verbs into transitive ones. It is the most productive prefix, as it is the only that can precede the other four above. It often occurs in conjunction with a reduplicative vowel suffix. For example, with \"luwak\", \"be jealous\", an adjective:\n\nThe majority of intransitive verbs have only a transitive causative form: \"pweipwei\" > \"kapweipwei\", \"to be stupid.\" Among verbs where \"ka-\" is productive, only adjectives and a few resultative intransitive verbs have both intransitive and transitive causative forms. Though the prefix is productive in many active and resultative verbs, it is not productive with neutral intransitive verbs, nor for a handful of intransitives denoting bodily functions such as \"sneeze\" (\"asi\"), \"frown\" (\"lolok\"), \"be full\" (\"tip\"), and \"be smelly\" (\"ingirek\"). The prefix \"ka-\" often has assimilative allophones depending on the stem, for example \"soai\" (to tell a tale) becomes koasoia\" (to talk), \"dou\" (to climb) becomes kodoudou\" (to trace one's ancestry), and \"rir\" (to be hidden) becomes \"kerir\" (secret sweetheart). As illustrated in these examples, the prefix often causes semantic differentiation, necessitating different constructions for literally causative meanings; \"karirala\", a different form employing \"ka-\", is used to mean \"to make hidden.\"\n\n\"Sa-\" and \"sou-\" negate verbs, however \"sou-\" is less productive than \"sa-\", which itself varies in productivity according to regional dialect. The general meaning of \"sa-\" appears to be \"not,\" while \"sou-\" apparently means \"un-,\" thus:\n\nLike \"ka-\", \"sa-\" displays assimilative allophony: \"ese\", \"to know\" > \"sehse\", \"to not know;\" \"loalekeng\", \"intelligent\" > \"soaloalekeng\", \"not intelligent.\" Only a single example has been found of \"sa-\" preceding \"ka-\": the word \"koasoakoahiek\" means \"inappropriate,\" deriving from the verb \"koahiek\", \"be competent.\"\n\n\"Ak-\" adds a semantic meaning of demonstration or display when combined with adjectives. When preceded by \"ka-\", it becomes \"kahk-\". \"Li-\" generally means \"may,\" or \"predisposed, given to\" some quality or action.\n\nGeneral intransitive verbs describe actions or events. They are divided into active, resultative, and neutral subtypes. For example, \"mwenge\" (to eat) and \"laid\" (to fish) are active; \"langada\" (to be hung up) and \"ritidi\" (to be closed) are resultative (static); and \"deidei\" (to sew, to be sewn) and \"pirap\" (to steal, to be stolen) are neutral — they can have either an active or a resultative meaning. Though resultative verbs sometimes resemble passive transitive verbs in English, they are in fact a class of intransitive verbs in Pohnpeian, which entirely lacks a comparable active-passive voice distinction. For example, \"Ohlo pahn kilel\" means both \"That man will take a photograph\" and \"That man will be photographed.\" Reduplication is frequently productive among general intransitives and adjectives alike. Derivations often include reduplication: \"pihs\" > \"pipihs\" (to urinate); \"us\" > \"usuhs\" (to pull out).\n\nMany intransitives are ablauted from their transitive forms, sometimes with reduplication: \"apid\" (trans.) > \"epid\" (intrans.) \"to carry on one's side,\" \"par\" (trans.) > \"periper\" (intrans.) \"to cut.\"\n\nOthers are derived from transitive forms through the prefix \"pV-\", conveying a meaning of reciprocal action: \"kakil\" (stare) > \"pekekil\" (stare at one another). These reciprocal intransitives form a distinct subgroup.\n\nA few intransitives derive from transitive roots through the suffix \"-ek\", though this is a fossilized suffix and is no longer productive. For example, \"dierek\" (to be found) from \"diar\" (to find); \"dilipek\" (for a thatch roof to be mended) from \"dilip\" (to mend a thatch roof). Sometimes this results in two intransitive derivations of a single transitive root, usually with a semantic nuance: transitive \"wengid\" (to wring), intransitive \"wengiweng\" (to wring/be wrung), intransitive \"wengidek\" (to be twisted); transitive \"widinge\" (to deceive), intransitive \"widing\" (to deceive/be deceived); intransitive \"widingek\" (to be deceitful). The suffix was apparently much more productive earlier in the language's history, even among active verbs.\n\nIntransitives include verbs that incorporate their objects, in contrast with transitives, which state objects separately; this is somewhat akin to \"babysitting\" in English. This process sometimes results in vowel shortening within the incorporated noun. Any verbal suffixes, normally suffixed to the initial verb, follow the incorporated object. Incorporation is not possible when there is a demonstrative suffix, however:\n\nPohnpeian adjectives are a class of non-action intransitive verbs. They function in a mostly parallel way to other intransitive verbs: \"E pahn [tang/lemei]\" – \"He will run/be cruel\"; \"E [tangtang/lemelemei]\" – \"He is running/being cruel\"; \"E [tenge/lamai] pwutako\" – \"He ran to/is cruel to that boy.\" Many adjectives themselves can be used as commands, and have transitive counterparts.\n\nAdjectives function as a subclass of intransitive verbs, though grammatical functions set them apart. For example, the superlative \"-ie\" is reserved for adjectives, as in \"lingan\", \"beautiful,\" and \"lingahnie\", \"most beautiful.\" Likewise reserved for adjectives is the suffix -\"ki\", which indicates instrumentality in transitive verbs, means \"to consider [beautiful]\" when suffixed to an adjective. Superlatives may also appear using the ordinal numeral \"keieu\" \"first.\" Comparatives are made through word order and the suffix \"-sang\": \"Pwihke laudsang pwihko\" means \"This pig is bigger than that pig.\"\n\nOne feature setting adjectives apart from non-active verbs is the productivity of the stative marker \"me\" (different from the pronoun and focus particle \"me\"), which is generally not grammatically correct with intransitive verbs of any kind:\n\nAnother aspect setting adjectives apart from other intransitives is that adjectives precede numerals, while intransitives follow. Adjectives generally follow the head noun, though possessives and numbers with fractions precede the noun: \n\nTransitive verbs consist of single roots and various suffixes upon modern intransitive verbs. Historically, intransitive verbs probably developed by dropping these transitive suffixes and ablauting.\n\nSome transitive verbs end in -VC on intransitive forms, appearing as unablauted or without reduplication; as intransitives were likely products of final syllable dropping, the endings are rather unpredictable: \"poad\" > \"poadok\", \"to plant,\" \"id\" > \"iding\", \"to make fire,\" \"pek\" > \"pakad\", \"to defecate,\" and \"dapadap\" > \"daper\", \"to catch.\"\n\nSeveral transitive verbs end in -\"ih\" on intransitive roots, sometimes also with vowel changes: \"malen\" > \"mahlenih\", \"to draw,\" \"sel\" > \"salih\", \"to tie,\" and \"erier\" > \"arih\", \"to stir, probe.\" This form is the most productive and is used with loanwords. For example: \"mahlenih\", deriving from German \"mahlen\", means \"to paint, draw.\"\n\nSome transitive verbs ending in short final vowels have intransitive counterparts that lack those endings; again, ablaut and reduplication often differentiate. Examples include \"langa\" > \"lang\", \"to hang up,\" \"doakoa\" > \"dok\", \"to spear,\" and \"rese\" > \"rasaras\", \"to sharpen.\" The short vowel ending \"-i\" appears only in \"-ki\".\n\nTransitive verbal suffixes include the perfective \"-ehr\", \"-ki\" (which derives verbs from nouns; different from the noun instrumental suffix \"-ki\" and short vowel suffix), object pronoun suffixes, and a host of directional suffixes. These include \"-ehng\" (towards) and \"-sang\" (away, without).\n\nPohnpeian has two canonical prepositions \"ni\" and \"nan\". \"Nan\" is used to express the containment of an object in either 2D or 3D space by another object, and \"ni\" expresses the attachment of an object to another object.\n\nBelow are some basic words and phrases in Pohnpeian:\n\n"}

{"id": "27125477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27125477", "title": "Salvadoran Spanish", "text": "Salvadoran Spanish\n\nSalvadoran Spanish is geographically defined as the form of Spanish spoken in the country of El Salvador. The Spanish dialect in El Salvador shares many similarities to that of its neighbors in the region, but it has its stark differences in pronunciation and usage. El Salvador, like most of Central America, uses voseo Spanish as its written and spoken form, similar to that of Argentina. Vos is used, but many Salvadorans understand tuteo. Vos can be heard in television programs and can be seen in written form in publications. \"Usted\" is used as a show of respect, when someone is speaking to an elderly person.\n\nNotable characteristics of Salvadoran phonology include the following:\n\n\"Vos\" is the dominant second person singular pronoun used by many speakers in familiar or informal contexts. Salvadoran \"vos\" comes from Gothic Spain and was brought to El Salvador by militaristic Spaniards migrated to the land. Its counterparts are French \"vous\", Portuguese \"vós\". Voseo is most commonly used among people in the same age group in addressing one another. It is common to hear young children address each other with \"vos.\" The phenomenon also occurs among adults who address one another in familiar or informal contexts. \"Vos\" is also used by adults in addressing children or juveniles. However, the relationship does not reoccur when children address adults. Children address adults with \"usted\" regardless of age, status or context. The preservation of voseo in Salvadoran Spanish was thanks to El Salvador's ties to the United States and Great Britain. When El Salvador became independent, it discontinued to have trade links with Spain, unlike other \"tuteo\" countries. El Salvador's main trading partners were the United States and Great Britain, thus Spain did not influence El Salvador's language anymore, and Spain changed to tuteo. In turn, English words influenced Salvadoran Spanish and voseo was conserved.\n\n\"Usted\" is the formal second person singular pronoun in Salvadoran Castilian. \"Usted\" is used in addressing foreigners formally, for acquaintances, and in business settings. Unlike nearby Costa Rica, \"usted\" is not the dominant second person pronoun for addressing a person.\n\n\"Tú\" is hardly used; the use of tú is limited strictly to foreigners. It is used in addressing foreigners familiarly and when writing correspondence to foreigners (again in familiar contexts).\n\nThe definition for Caliche is an informal term for Salvadoran Spanish due to colloquialisms and unique indigenous lexical words that are different from Salvadoran Spanish. Caliche refers to the Nawat (Pipil) influenced dialect of Spanish spoken in El Salvador. Many words have gone through the process of deletion, vowel assimilation, or epenthesis to make it easier for the speaker to understand. Salvadoran Caliche is used across social classes, although professional individuals tend to avoid it because it is not considered \"proper\" Spanish.\n\nFor example, this table shows the difference between Standard Salvadoran Spanish and Caliche:\n\nWords like this are not unique to El Salvador, and when heard by someone that is Salvadoran or from neighbouring countries they are understood. Nahuatl's influence appears in the word \"chiche\", which means \"parte del seno de la mujer\" (DRAE (breast area) from Nahuatl Chichi \"mama, teta\"). But chiche in El Salvador means \"facil\" (\"que no requiere gran esfuerzo\"/\"easy—it does not require much effort\"). Another word influenced by Nahuatl is the word \"guishte\" that means a piece of broken glass. This word does not appear in any dictionary so its origin cannot be traced, but the only hypothesis behind this word was proposed by Pedro Geoffroy Rivas—an anthropologist, poet, and linguist—who believed that it came from the Pipil language, since El Salvador's Spanish has been heavily influenced by it.\nUnfortunately, Caliche is not described in studies on Salvadoran Spanish. The philologist John M. Lipski points out that Centro American Spanish (including the Spanish spoken in El Salvador) lacks adequate sources for linguistic and literary research. Lipski further elaborates that such linguistic shortage indicates a possible generalization that in recent decades Salvadoran dialectology has failed to advance as rapidly as the comparative work in other Latin American nations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "303405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303405", "title": "Universal set", "text": "Universal set\n\nIn set theory, a universal set is a set which contains all objects, including itself. In set theory as usually formulated, the conception of a universal set leads to a paradox (Russell's paradox) and is consequently not allowed. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.\n\nThere is no standard notation for the universal set of a given set theory. Common symbols include V, U and ξ.\n\nZermelo–Fraenkel set theory and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the cumulative hierarchy, do not allow for the existence of a universal set. It is directly contradicted by the axiom of regularity, and its existence would cause paradoxes which would make the theory inconsistent.\n\nRussell's paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and other set theories that include Zermelo's axiom of comprehension.\nThis axiom states that, for any formula formula_1 and any set , there exists another set \nthat contains exactly those elements of that satisfy formula_3. If a universal set  existed and the axiom of comprehension could be applied to it, then\nthere would also exist another set formula_4, the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. However, as Bertrand Russell observed, this set is paradoxical. If it contains itself, then it should not contain itself, and vice versa. For this reason, it cannot exist.\n\nA second difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the power set of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist. However, this conflicts with Cantor's theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher cardinality than the set itself.\n\nThe difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.\n\nThere are set theories known to be consistent (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set does exist (and formula_5 is true). In these theories, Zermelo's axiom of comprehension does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of naive set theory is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a non-well-founded set theory.\nThe most widely studied set theory with a universal set is Willard Van Orman Quine's New Foundations. Alonzo Church and also published work on such set theories. Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine's,\n\nAnother example is positive set theory, where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the positive formulas (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.\n\nThe idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see universal quantifier). One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe and similar large collections as proper classes rather than as sets. One difference between a universal set and a universal class is that the universal class does not contain itself, because proper classes cannot be elements of other classes. Russell's paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.\n\nThe category of sets can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. \nAgain, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.\n\n\n"}
