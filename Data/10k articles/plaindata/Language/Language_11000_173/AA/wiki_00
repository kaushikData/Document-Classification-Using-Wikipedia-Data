The purpose of an abstract of judgment is to create a public record and create a lien or claim if necessary on any real estate property owned or later acquired by the defendant located in the county in which the abstract of judgment is recorded. If the loser does not pay the judgment voluntarily then the winner can force a sheriff's sale of any property to collect. There are several problems: 1) to find the county where the loser owns real estate property; 2) the probability that there are secured loans, tax liens and/or other judgments that come ahead of the judgment lien; 3) the possibility that the loser/debtor may go bankrupt and avoid paying the debt.\n\nAn abstract is a brief summary of a judicial judgment, usually written by a Barrister or academic for publication in law reports.\n\nAbstracts are of particular use in legal research because they condense the essential points of long, complex judgments into a few paragraphs. A researcher can use abstracts to investigate how relevant a particular case is to the issue at hand, and hence to decide whether he or she should go on to read the entire judgment.\n\nThe term \"abstract of judgment\" may be used in a generic sense to describe a condensed summary of a court case, but it is chiefly used in a technical sense to describe a document produced by a court which describes the judgment rendered in a case.\n\nAn abstract of judgment is a clerical document containing a summary of court proceedings which may be useful though not conclusive in proving a prior conviction for the purposes of enhancement. \"United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez\", 405 F.3d 352, 357 - 58 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding a sentencing court could not rely on an abstract of judgment to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies to enhance a sentence); \"United States v. Navidad-Marcos\", 367 F.3d 903, 908 - 09 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding an abstract of judgment did not \"unequivocally\" establish that a defendant entered a guilty plea); \"see also United States. v. Price\", 366 U.S. App. D.C. 166, 409 F.3d 436, 445 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\nIn some states, such as Texas, an abstract of judgment is a specific type of document provided either by the court clerk or by an attorney which is used to prove that a judgment has been rendered. The abstract may then be filed in another jurisdiction, where it constitutes notice of a \"judgment lien\" on the debtor's real property, thereby preventing the transfer of that property until the judgment has been paid. This process was described by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1987:\n\n\"Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc\"., 481 U.S. 1, 5 (U.S. 1987)\n"}
{"id": "2013704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2013704", "title": "B. Jeyamohan", "text": "B. Jeyamohan\n\nB. Jeyamohan (also credited as Jayamohan; born 22 April 1962) is a Tamil and Malayalam writer and literary critic from Nagercoil in Kanyakumari District in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nHis best-known and most critically acclaimed work is \"Vishnupuram\", a fantasy set as a quest through various schools of Indian philosophy and mythology. In 2014 he started his most ambitious work \"Venmurasu\", a modern renarration of the epic \"Mahabharata\".\n\nHis other well-known novels include \"Rubber\", \"Pin Thodarum Nizhalin Kural\", \"Kanyakumari\", \"Kaadu\", \"Pani Manidhan\", \"Eazhaam Ulagam\" and \"Kotravai\". The early major influences in his life have been the humanitarian thinkers Leo Tolstoy and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Drawing on the strength of his life experiences and extensive travel around India, Jeyamohan is able to re-examine and interpret the essence of India's rich literary and classical traditions.\n\nBorn into a Malayali Nair family in the Kanyakumari district that straddles Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Jeyamohan is equally adept in Tamil and Malayalam. However, the bulk of his work has been in Tamil. Jeyamohan's output includes nine novels, ten volumes of short-stories/plays, thirteen literary criticisms, five biographies of writers, six introductions to Indian and Western literature, three volumes on Hindu and Christian philosophy and numerous other translations and collections. He has also written scripts for Malayalam and Tamil movies.\n\nJeyamohan was born on 22 April 1962 in Arumanai of Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, to S.Bahuleyan Pillai and B.Visalakshi Amma. Bahuleyan Pillai was an accounts clerk in the Arumanai registrar's office. Visalakshi Amma hailed from a family of intellectuals and trade-unionists. Jeyamohan's siblings were an elder brother and a younger sister. Bahuleyan's family followed him around on his work-related transfers to Thiruvattar and Arumanai towns in the Kanyakumari district.\n\nVery early on, Jeyamohan was inspired by his mother to take up writing. Jeyamohan's first publication during schooldays was in \"Ratnabala\", a children's magazine, followed by a host of publications in popular weeklies. After high school, Jeyamohan was pressured by his father to take up commerce and accountancy in college. The suicide of a close friend drove him to drop out of college and constantly travel the country in search of physical and spiritual experience. He supported himself by taking up odd jobs and writing in pulp magazines all the while reading voraciously. He took up a temporary job at the Telephones department in Kasargode where he became close to the Leftist trade union circles. He received many of his formative ideas on historiography and literary narrative during that period.\n\nVisalakshi and Bahuleyan committed suicide within a month of each other in 1984, and this drove Jeyamohan further into an itinerant lifestyle. He met writer Sundara Ramasamy in 1985 who took on the role of a mentor and encouraged him to take up writing seriously. Jeyamohan also got another mentor in the form of Aatroor Ravi Varma who sensitized him to the delicate balance between art and life. In parallel, Jeyamohan was an avid read of Indian classics and philosophical texts like the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nIn 1987, the journal \"Kollippaavai\" published his poem \"Kaidhi\" (\"The Prisoner\"). In the same year, \"Nadhi\" (\"The River\") was published in \"Kanaiyazhi\" with a critical mention from writer Ashoka Mitran. The journal \"Nigazh\" published \"Bodhi\", followed by \"Padugai\" ('The Riverbed'). Critics heaped praise on \"Padugai\" for its evocative narrative that wove together myths and contemporary visuals. Jeyamohan wrote his first full-fledged novel \"Rubber\" in 1988 and then re-edited and published it in 1990.\n\nThe novel won the Akilan Memorial prize for its path-breaking portrayal of the ecological and sociological impact of rubber cultivation in the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Jeyamohan's speech at the awards function was well received, and he further developed those ideas in \"Novel\" (1990), an exploration of the art form and its ideologies, and \"Naveena Thamizhilakkiya Arimugam\", a comprehensive introduction to modernist Tamil literature.\n\nIn 1993, Jeyamohan met Guru Nitya Chaitanya Yati which proved to be a turning point in his spiritual journey. The dialogues with the Guru opened new views into the body of Indian thought, which culminated in his acclaimed work \"Vishnupuram\" in 1997. Jeyamohan travelled and witnessed first-hand regional issues, droughts and political problems that underlay issues like Naxalism in tribal areas. His experiences convinced him of the continuing relevance of Gandhian idealism and non-violence as the sensible alternative to naked capitalism and militant socialism. The leftist in him had been saddened by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a decade long introspection on the nature of power and self-righteousness found expression in \"Pin Thodarum Nizhalin Kural\" in 1999.\n\nPost-2000, Jeyamohan broke new ground with \"Kaadu\" (2003), an exploration of the forest landscape as a metaphor for lust and the vigour of life. \"Kotravai\" (2005), the renarration of the Kannagi epic, was deemed by the writer and critics as his best yet in terms of structure and depth.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2004, Jeyamohan and his friends edited a literary journal named \"Solputhithu\". In 2009, his readership circle created the 'Vishnupuram Ilakkiya Vattam' to broaden the readership for serious literature in Tamil Nadu and to reward under-recognized pioneers of Tamil literature.\n\nWhen he turned 50, Jeyamohan wrote a set of short-stories, titled 'Aram', that explored the values and idealism that is possible in man. In 2014, Jeyamohan began writing \"Venmurasu\", a re-narration of the Indian epic Mahabharata.\n\nIn parallel, Jeyamohan has produced a prolific output as one of the foremost Literary critics and theorists of modern Indian literature with focus on Tamil. His 30 volumes on criticism and anthologies have earned him a respectable place among critics like Vedasagayakumar.\n\nIn 2013, he was considered as Tamil Author of the year by National Library, Singapore. In 2016, he worked as Writer in residence for 2 months at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, organized by National Arts Council (Singapore) and National Institute of Education.\n\nJeyamohan had been an active participant in Tamil internet discussion groups like Mayyam, Forumhub and Thinnai.com during the early years of the medium in India. As part of the debates, Jeyamohan produced some of his best essays on literary standards and criticism during this period. Recognizing the possibility of losing some of these important works, Jeyamohan's friend and writer Cyril Alex created the author's website for consolidating the author's works. Over the decade, the website has become an important repository of the author's essays running into thousands.\n\nThe author follows an innovative publishing model in which he serialises all new content on the website and allows free access, while simultaneously offering hardbacks and paperbacks through publishers. More significantly, the website allows the author to freely engage in discussions with thousands of readers on the axioms that govern his works and thought. In early 2011, the Vishnupuram Ilakkiya Vattam has created an online moderated discussion group for discussing literature, criticism, art and related topics.\n\nJeyamohan gravitated towards Gandhian philosophy and political principles through debates with many intellectuals of the era. His considerable writing resulted in the corpus of essays published in 2009 as Indraya Gandhi, a collection that examined the continuing relevance of Gandhi's methods and ideals in modern India. Indraya Gandhi explored new dimensions on Gandhi's life including his relationship with Nehru, Ambedkar and Dalit politics and the topic of Lust. Jeyamohan has continued to highlight many Gandhians who represent the philosophy.\n\nAs a part of the series, he sought to explain how the next generation of Gandhian leaders like Anna Hazare were continuing to inspire the nation towards achieving true democracy and equality. Jeyamohan had been one of the first Indian ideologues to write about Anna Hazare many years before Anna Hazare's popular anti-graft movement. Jeyamohan had personally visited Ralegaon Siddhi to see Hazare's social movements in action, and he also wrote about Hazare's tireless struggle to get the Right to Information Act passed in the Indian parliament.\n\nThroughout 2011, Jeyamohan continued to write about and support Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement and the Jan Lokpal bill. Rather than focus on the minutiae of the bill itself, Jeyamohan focused readers' attention on the ideology behind Hazare's actions – how he appealed directly to the sense of justice in the common man, his symbolism, and the Gandhian method of achieving the ultimate goal through civil non-violent mass movement without letting up any opportunity to discuss and negotiate with political opponents. Amidst widespread scepticism and slander flamed up by the national and regional media across the political spectrum, Jeyamohan remained rock solid in support of Anna Hazare's movement. By the end of the summer of 2011, Jeyamohan had written close to 60 essays on the topic, many of them in answer to readers who had written in expressing their own doubts and questions. In 2016, on the occasion of state elections in Tamil Nadu, Jeyamohan wrote a series of essays on Democracy in the newspaper Dinamalar which was published as a book.\n\nJeyamohan's works like 'Kaadu' and 'Mathagam' feature elephants in central roles, while his biographical and travel essays capture the centrality of nature, ecology and conservation to the Indian way of life. One such true-life story on the conservationist Dr.V. Krishnamurthy (veterinarian) ('Dr K, the Elephant Doctor') sparked huge interest and discussion among readers on the impact of humans on forest life. Told in semi-fictional form as through the eyes of a forest ranger, the story follows Dr K as, despite having a giant reputation in the naturalist circles, he eschews human accolades and seeks a much more rewarding life in the company of animals in the Indian Forest Department's elephant camps. 'The Elephant Doctor' has been included in the Tamil textbook published by the Department of School Education,Tamil Nadu as part of the revised syllabus for the year 2018.\n\nJeyamohan has found himself at the centre of many controversies:\n\nJeyamohan was introduced to Arunmozhi Nangai as a reader and married her in 1991.

{"id": "105391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=105391", "title": "B movie", "text": "B movie\n\nA B movie or B film is a low-budget commercial movie, but not an arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s, the term \"B movie\" continues to be used in its broader sense to this day. In its post-Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.\n\nIn either usage, most B movies represent a particular genre—the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more popular in the 1950s. Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed films they were paired with, many had running times of 70 minutes or less. The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more lavishly budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.\n\nLatter-day B movies still sometimes inspire multiple sequels, but series are less common. As the average running time of top-of-the-line films increased, so did that of B pictures. In its current usage, the term has somewhat contradictory connotations: it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is (a) a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or (b) a lively, energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively \"serious\" independent film. The term is also now used loosely to refer to some higher-budgeted, mainstream films with exploitation-style content, usually in genres traditionally associated with the B movie.\n\nFrom their beginnings to the present day, B movies have provided opportunities both for those coming up in the profession and others whose careers are waning. Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their craft in B movies. They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson first became established, and they have provided work for former A movie actors, such as Vincent Price and Karen Black. Some actors, such as Bela Lugosi, Eddie Constantine and Pam Grier, worked in B movies for most of their careers. The term \"B actor\" is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures.\n\nIn 1927–28, at the end of the silent era, the production cost of an average feature from a major Hollywood studio ranged from $190,000 at Fox to $275,000 at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. That average reflected both \"specials\" that might cost as much as and films made quickly for around $50,000. These cheaper films (not yet called \"B movies\") allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel. Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), focused on exactly those sorts of cheap productions. Their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs, particularly small-town and urban neighborhood venues, or \"nabes\". Even smaller production houses, known as Poverty Row studios, made films whose costs might run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.\n\nWith the widespread arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts and a broad variety of shorts before a single featured film. A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice: a newsreel, a short and/or serial, and a cartoon, followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts. The majors' \"clearance\" rules favoring their affiliated theaters prevented the independents' timely access to top-quality films; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead. The additional movie also gave the program \"balance\"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. The low-budget picture of the 1920s thus evolved into the second feature, the B movie, of Hollywood's Golden Age.\n\nThe major studios, at first resistant to the double feature, soon adapted. All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking became standard practice: to get access to a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs' quality—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (20th Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO)—also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line.\n\nPoverty Row studios, from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures, Tiffany Pictures, and Sono Art-World Wide Pictures down to shoestring operations, made exclusively B movies, serials, and other shorts, and also distributed totally independent productions and imported films. In no position to directly block book, they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to \"states rights\" firms, which in turn peddled blocks of movies to exhibitors, typically six or more pictures featuring the same star (a relative status on Poverty Row). Two \"major-minors\"—Universal Studios and rising Columbia Pictures—had production lines roughly similar to, though somewhat better endowed than, the top Poverty Row studios. In contrast to the Big Five majors, Universal and Columbia had few or no theaters, though they did have top-rank film distribution exchanges.\n\nIn the standard Golden Age model, the industry's top product, the A films, premiered at a small number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by Edward Jay Epstein, \"During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising.\" Then it was off to the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed two or three times a week. To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as \"quickies\" for their tight production schedules—as short as four days. As Brian Taves describes, \"Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily.\" Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, \"[t]he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got\", writes Epstein. Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.\n\nThe introduction of sound had driven costs higher: by 1930, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce. A broad range of motion pictures occupied the B category. The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as \"programmers\" (also known as \"in-betweeners\" or \"intermediates\"). As Taves describes, \"Depending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee.\" On Poverty Row, many Bs were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major's A film, with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as $5,000. By the mid-1930s, the double feature was the dominant U.S. exhibition model, and the majors responded. In 1935, B movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50% of studio output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known as the \"Keeper of the Bs\". At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, Sol M. Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s.\n\nA number of the top Poverty Row firms consolidated: Sono Art joined another company to create Monogram Pictures early in the decade. In 1935, Monogram, Mascot, and several smaller studios merged to establish Republic Pictures. The former heads of Monogram soon sold off their Republic shares and set up a new Monogram production house. Into the 1950s, most Republic and Monogram product was roughly on par with the low end of the majors' output. Less sturdy Poverty Row concerns—with a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest, Empire, Imperial, and Peerless—continued to churn out dirt-cheap quickies. Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature releases in 1938, indicating the studios' relative emphasis on B production (United Artists produced little, focusing on the distribution of prestigious films from independent outfits; Grand National, active 1936–40, occupied an analogous niche on Poverty Row, releasing mostly independent productions):\nTaves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies. Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms, approximately 75% of Hollywood movies from the decade, more than four thousand pictures, are classifiable as Bs.\n\nThe Western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and, to a lesser degree, the 1940s. Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that \"the 'B' product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [Tom] Mix, [Ken] Maynard, and [Buck] Jones, the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy, the RKO George O'Brien series, the Republic Westerns with John Wayne and the Three Mesquiteers ... achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story.\" At the far end of the industry, Poverty Row's Ajax put out oaters starring Harry Carey, then in his fifties. The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series, the American Rough Rider series, and the Morton of the Mounted \"northwest action thrillers\". One low-budget oater of the era, made totally outside the studio system, profited from an outrageous concept: a Western with an all-midget cast, \"The Terror of Tiny Town\" (1938) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.\n\nSeries of various genres, featuring recurrent, title-worthy characters or name actors in familiar roles, were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film. Fox's many B series, for instance, included Charlie Chan mysteries, Ritz Brothers comedies, and musicals with child star Jane Withers. These series films are not to be confused with the short, cliffhanger-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, many series were intended to attract young people—a theater that twin-billed part-time might run a \"balanced\" or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the words of one industry report, afternoon moviegoers, \"composed largely of housewives and children, want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want 'something good and not too much of it.'\" Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category, but even here there is ambiguity: at MGM, for example, popular series like the Andy Hardy and the Dr. Kildare - Dr. Gillespie chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A-level at most of the lesser studios. For many series, even a lesser major's standard B budget was far out of reach: Poverty Row's Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan, the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features.\n\nBy 1940, the average production cost of an American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50% of theaters were double-billing exclusively, and others employed the policy part-time. In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures. Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers. Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, now commanded about 95% of U.S. and Canadian box office receipts. In 1946, independent producer David O. Selznick brought his bloated-budget spectacle \"Duel in the Sun\" to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release. The distribution strategy was a major success, despite what was widely perceived as the movie's poor quality. The \"Duel\" release anticipated practices that fueled the B movie industry in the late 1950s; when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that, the B movie would be hard hit.\n\nConsiderations beside cost made the line between A and B movies ambiguous. Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as sleeper hits: one of 1943's biggest films was \"Hitler's Children\", an RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than in rentals, industry language for a distributor's share of gross box office receipts. Particularly in the realm of film noir, A pictures sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Programmers, with their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition. As late as 1948, the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode—it was standard policy at 25% of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36%. The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope; in 1947, Monogram established a subsidiary, Allied Artists, to develop and distribute relatively expensive films, mostly from independent producers. Around the same time, Republic launched a similar effort under the \"Premiere\" rubric. In 1947 as well, PRC was subsumed by Eagle-Lion, a British company seeking entry to the American market. Warners' former \"Keeper of the Bs\", Brian Foy, was installed as production chief.\n\nIn the 1940s, RKO stood out among the industry's Big Five for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, the most famous of the major studios' Golden Age B units is Val Lewton's horror unit at RKO. Lewton produced such moody, mysterious films as \"Cat People\" (1942), \"I Walked with a Zombie\" (1943), and \"The Body Snatcher\" (1945), directed by Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise, and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—\"Stranger on the Third Floor\" (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein. The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were A-level productions, most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age.\n\nIn one sample year, 1947, RKO produced along with several noir programmers and A pictures, two straight B noirs: \"Desperate\" and \"The Devil Thumbs a Ride\". Ten B noirs that year came from Poverty Row's big three—Republic, Monogram, and PRC/Eagle-Lion—and one came from tiny Screen Guild. Three majors beside RKO contributed a total of five more. Along with these eighteen unambiguous B noirs, an additional dozen or so noir programmers came out of Hollywood. Still, most of the majors' low-budget production remained the sort now largely ignored. RKO's representative output included the Mexican Spitfire and Lum and Abner comedy series, thrillers featuring the Saint and the Falcon, Westerns starring Tim Holt, and Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller. Jean Hersholt played Dr. Christian in six films between 1939 and 1941. \"The Courageous Dr. Christian\" (1940) was a standard entry: \"In the course of an hour or so of screen time, the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis, demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised, set an example for wayward youth, and calm the passions of an amorous old maid.\"\n\nDown in Poverty Row, low budgets led to less palliative fare. Republic aspired to major-league respectability while making many cheap and modestly budgeted Westerns, but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram \"exploitation pictures\" like juvenile delinquency exposé \"Where Are Your Children?\" (1943) and the prison film \"Women in Bondage\" (1943). In 1947, PRC's \"The Devil on Wheels\" brought together teenagers, hot rods, and death. The little studio had its own house auteur: with his own crew and relatively free rein, director Edgar G. Ulmer was known as \"the Capra of PRC\". Ulmer made films of every generic stripe: his \"Girls in Chains\" was released in May 1943, six months before \"Women in Bondage\"; by the end of the year, Ulmer had also made the teen-themed musical \"Jive Junction\" as well as \"Isle of Forgotten Sins\", a South Seas adventure set around a brothel.\n\nIn 1948, a Supreme Court ruling in a federal antitrust suit against the majors outlawed block booking and led to the Big Five divesting their theater chains. With audiences draining away to television and studios scaling back production schedules, the classic double feature vanished from many American theaters during the 1950s. The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling, offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of traditional B films. With television airing many classic Westerns as well as producing its own original Western series, the cinematic market for B oaters in particular was drying up. After barely inching forward in the 1930s, the average U.S. feature production cost had essentially doubled over the 1940s, reaching by the turn of the decade—a 93% rise after adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe first prominent victim of the changing market was Eagle-Lion, which released its last films in 1951. By 1953, the old Monogram brand had disappeared, the company having adopted the identity of its higher-end subsidiary, Allied Artists. The following year, Allied released Hollywood's last B series Westerns. Non-series B Westerns continued to appear for a few more years, but Republic Pictures, long associated with cheap sagebrush sagas, was out of the filmmaking business by decade's end. In other genres, Universal kept its Ma and Pa Kettle series going through 1957, while Allied Artists stuck with the Bowery Boys until 1958. RKO, weakened by years of mismanagement, exited the movie industry in 1957. Hollywood's A product was getting longer—the top ten box-office releases of 1940 had averaged 112.5 minutes; the average length of 1955's top ten was 123.4. In their modest way, the Bs were following suit. The age of the hour-long feature film was past; 70 minutes was now roughly the minimum. While the Golden Age-style second feature was dying, \"B movie\" was still used to refer to any low-budget genre film featuring relatively unheralded performers (sometimes referred to as \"B actors\"). The term retained its earlier suggestion that such movies relied on formulaic plots, \"stock\" character types, and simplistic action or unsophisticated comedy. At the same time, the realm of the B movie was becoming increasingly fertile territory for experimentation, both serious and outlandish.\n\nIda Lupino, a leading actress, established herself as Hollywood's sole female director of the era. In short, low-budget pictures made for her production company, The Filmakers, Lupino explored virtually taboo subjects such as rape in 1950's \"Outrage\" and 1953's self-explanatory \"The Bigamist\". Her best known directorial effort, \"The Hitch-Hiker\", a 1953 RKO release, is the only film noir from the genre's classic period directed by a woman. That year, RKO released \"Split Second\", which concludes in a nuclear test range, and is perhaps the first \"atomic noir\". The most famous such movie, the independently produced \"Kiss Me Deadly\" (1955), typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture, as Richard Maltby describes: a \"programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre's double-bill, [it was] budgeted at approximately $400,000. [Its] distributor, United Artists, released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 in 1955.\" The film's length, 106 minutes, is A level, but its star, Ralph Meeker, had previously appeared in only one major film. Its source is pure pulp, one of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels, but Robert Aldrich's direction is self-consciously aestheticized. The result is a brutal genre picture that also evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb.\n\nThe fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, along with less expressible qualms about radioactive fallout from America's own atomic tests, energized many of the era's genre films. Science fiction, horror, and various hybrids of the two were now of central economic importance to the low-budget end of the business. Most down-market films of the type—like many of those produced by William Alland at Universal (such as \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" (1954)) and Sam Katzman at Columbia (including \"It Came from Beneath the Sea\" (1955))—provided little more than thrills, though their special effects could be impressive. But these were genres whose fantastic nature could also be used as cover for mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies. Director Don Siegel's \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956), released by Allied Artists, treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting, allegorical fashion. \"The Amazing Colossal Man\" (1957), directed by Bert I. Gordon, is both a monster movie that happens to depict the horrific effects of radiation exposure and \"a ferocious cold-war fable [that] spins Korea, the army's obsessive secrecy, and America's post-war growth into one fantastic whole.\"\n\n\"The Amazing Colossal Man\" was released by a new company whose name was much bigger than its budgets. American International Pictures (AIP), founded in 1956 by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff in a reorganization of their American Releasing Corporation (ARC), soon became the leading U.S. studio devoted entirely to B-cost productions. American International helped keep the original-release double bill alive through paired packages of its films: these movies were low-budget, but instead of a flat rate, they were rented out on a percentage basis, like A films. The success of \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\" (1957) thus brought AIP a large return—made for about $100,000, it grossed more than . As the film's title suggests, the studio relied on both fantastic genre subjects and new, teen-oriented angles. When \"Hot Rod Gang\" (1958) turned a profit, hot rod horror was given a try: \"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow\" (1959). David Cook credits AIP with leading the way \"in demographic exploitation, target marketing, and saturation booking, all of which would become standard procedure for the majors in planning and releasing their mass-market 'event' films\" by the late 1970s. In terms of content, the majors were already there, with films about juvenile delinquency such as Warner Bros.' \"Untamed Youth\" (1957) and MGM's \"High School Confidential\" (1958), both starring Mamie Van Doren.\n\nIn 1954, a young filmmaker named Roger Corman received his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists' \"Highway Dragnet\". Corman soon independently produced his first movie, \"Monster from the Ocean Floor\", on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule. Among the six films he worked on in 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release, \"Apache Woman\", and \"Day the World Ended\", half of Arkoff and Nicholson's first twin-bill package. Corman would go on to direct over fifty feature films through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 movies to his credit. Often referred to as the \"King of the Bs\", Corman has said that \"to my way of thinking, I never made a 'B' movie in my life\", as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures. He prefers to describe his metier as \"low-budget exploitation films\". In later years Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, would help launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Robert Towne, and Robert De Niro, among many others.\n\nIn the late 1950s, William Castle became known as the great innovator of the B movie publicity gimmick. Audiences of \"Macabre\" (1958), an $86,000 production distributed by Allied Artists, were invited to take out insurance policies to cover potential death from fright. The 1959 creature feature \"The Tingler\" featured Castle's most famous gimmick, Percepto: at the film's climax, buzzers attached to select theater seats would unexpectedly rattle a few audience members, prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate laughter. With such films, Castle \"combine[d] the saturation advertising campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor.\"\n\nThe postwar drive-in theater boom was vital to the expanding independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, there were more than 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie.\n\nIncreasingly, American-made genre films were joined by foreign movies acquired at low cost and, where necessary, dubbed for the U.S. market. In 1956, distributor Joseph E. Levine financed the shooting of new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the Japanese sci-fi horror film \"Godzilla\". The British Hammer Film Productions made the successful \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" (1957) and \"Dracula\" (1958), major influences on future horror film style. In 1959, Levine's Embassy Pictures bought the worldwide rights to \"Hercules\", a cheaply made Italian movie starring American-born bodybuilder Steve Reeves. On top of a $125,000 purchase price, Levine then spent on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount. \"The New York Times\" was not impressed, claiming that the movie would have drawn \"little more than yawns in the film market ... had it not been [launched] throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity.\" Levine counted on first-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film \"into as many cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him.\" \"Hercules\" opened at a remarkable 600 theaters, and the strategy was a smashing success: the film earned in domestic rentals. Just as valuable to the bottom line, it was even more successful overseas. Within a few decades, Hollywood would be dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very much like Levine's.\n\nDespite all the transformations in the industry, by 1961 the average production cost of an American feature film was still only —after adjusting for inflation, less than 10% more than it had been in 1950. The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The AIP-style dual genre package was the new model. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, \"Hercules Unchained\", opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. A suspense film, \"Terror Is a Man\", ran as a \"co-feature\" with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: \"The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'\" That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: \"When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color.\" The resulting \"House of Usher\" typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification. It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000 (one tenth the industry average), and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: \"Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes.\"\n\nWith the loosening of industry censorship constraints, the 1960s saw a major expansion in the commercial viability of a variety of B movie subgenres that became known collectively as \"exploitation films\". The combination of intensive and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter and often outrageous imagery dated back decades—the term had originally defined truly fringe productions, made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system. Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices, particularly \"sexual hygiene\". Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision. Such films were not generally booked as part of movie theaters' regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters (they might also appear as fodder for \"grindhouses\", which typically had no regular schedule at all). The most famous of those promoters, Kroger Babb, was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget, sensationalistic films with a \"100% saturation campaign\", inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium. In the era of the traditional double feature, no one would have characterized these graphic exploitation films as \"B movies\". With the majors having exited traditional B production and exploitation-style promotion becoming standard practice at the lower end of the industry, \"exploitation\" became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films. The 1960s would see exploitation-style themes and imagery become increasingly central to the realm of the B.\nExploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear: 1961's \"Damaged Goods\", a cautionary tale about a young lady whose boyfriend's promiscuity leads to venereal disease, comes complete with enormous, grotesque closeups of VD's physical effects. At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a related, similarly venerable tradition: \"nudie\" films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, \"This Nude World\" was \"Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!\" In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically to \"adult\" product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with greater attention to plot. Best known was Russ Meyer, who released his first successful narrative nudie, the comic \"Immoral Mr. Teas\", in 1959. Five years later, Meyer came out with his breakthrough film, \"Lorna\", which combined sex, violence, and a dramatic storyline. \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" (1965), made for about $45,000, would ultimately become the most famous of Meyer's sexploitation pictures. Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity, it was aimed at the same \"passion pit\" drive-in circuit that screened AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" (1965) and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\" (1966), starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Roger Corman's \"The Trip\" (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor Jack Nicholson, never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout. The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer.\n\nOne of the most influential films of the era, on Bs and beyond, was Paramount's \"Psycho\". Its in earnings against a production cost of $800,000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960. Its mainstream distribution without the Production Code seal of approval helped weaken U.S. film censorship. And, as William Paul notes, this move into the horror genre by respected director Alfred Hitchcock was made, \"significantly, with the lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars. [Its] greatest initial impact ... was on schlock horror movies (notably those from second-tier director William Castle), each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than \"Psycho\".\" Castle's first film in the \"Psycho\" vein was \"Homicidal\" (1961), an early step in the development of the slasher subgenre that would take off in the late 1970s. \"Blood Feast\" (1963), a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $24,000 by experienced nudie-maker Herschell Gordon Lewis, established a new, more immediately successful subgenre, the gore or splatter film. Lewis's business partner David F. Friedman drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers—the sort of gimmick Castle had mastered—and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida—the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against, except Friedman had planned it. This new breed of gross-out movie typified the emerging sense of \"exploitation\"—the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film industry as a whole. Imports of Hammer Film's increasingly explicit horror movies and Italian gialli, highly stylized pictures mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence, would fuel this trend.\n\nThe Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968, to be replaced by the first version of the modern rating system. That year, two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade, with major consequences for the B movie. One was a high-budget Paramount production, directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski. Produced by B horror veteran William Castle, \"Rosemary's Baby\" was the first upscale Hollywood picture in the genre in three decades. It was a critical success and the year's seventh-biggest hit. The other was George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\", produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues, it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and domestic racial conflicts. Its greatest influence, though, derived from its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery, low-cost, truly independent means of production, and high profitability. With the Code gone and the X rating established, major studio A films like \"Midnight Cowboy\" could now show \"adult\" imagery, while the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded. In this transformed commercial context, work like Russ Meyer's gained a new legitimacy. In 1969, for the first time a Meyer film, \"Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!\", was reviewed in \"The New York Times\". Soon, Corman would be putting out nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as \"Private Duty Nurses\" (1971) and \"Women in Cages\" (1971).\n\nIn May 1969, the most important exploitation movie of the era premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Much of \"Easy Rider\"s significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, Peter Fonda, to American International. Fonda had become AIP's top star in the Corman-directed \"The Wild Angels\" (1966), a biker movie, and \"The Trip\", as in taking LSD. The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator, Dennis Hopper, also a studio alumnus, free directorial rein. Eventually they arranged a financing and distribution deal with Columbia, as two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer László Kovács. The film (which incorporated another favorite exploitation theme, the redneck menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity) was brought in at a cost of $501,000. It earned in rentals. In the words of historians Seth Cagin and Philip Dray, \"Easy Rider\" became \"the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's New World Pictures, Cannon Films, and New Line Cinema brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes. The Bs were keeping pace. In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World: the average length was 89.8 minutes. These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie \"Angels Die Hard\", cost $117,000 to produce and took in more than at the box office.\n\nThe biggest studio in the low-budget field remained a leader in exploitation's growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma. Reviewing \"Sisters\", Pauline Kael observed that its \"limp technique doesn't seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore. ... [H]e can't get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938.\" Many examples of the blaxploitation genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" (1970). Several New World pictures followed, including \"The Big Doll House\" (1971) and \"The Big Bird Cage\" (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: \"Coffy\" (1973) and \"Foxy Brown\" (1974).\n\nBlaxploitation was the first exploitation genre in which the major studios were central. Indeed, the United Artists release \"Cotton Comes to Harlem\" (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, is seen as the first significant film of the type. But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent: \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" (1971) is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form: wildly experimental, borderline pornographic, and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby. Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries, then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian \"Mondo Cane\" \"shockumentaries\" and the Swedish skin flick \"Fanny Hill\", as well as for its one in-house production, \"The Man from O.R.G.Y.\" (1970). These sorts of films played in the \"grindhouses\" of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.\n\nIn 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by first-time American director Barbara Loden won the international critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. \"Wanda\" is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production, for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for \"the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and ... purity of technique.\" Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, \"Bone\" (1972), \"Black Caesar\" (1973), and \"Hell Up in Harlem\" (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film \"Deathdream\" (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: \"Shivers\" (1975), \"Rabid\" (1977), \"The Brood\" (1979). An \"Easy Rider\" with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed \"Electra Glide in Blue\" (1973), directed by James William Guercio. \"The New York Times\" reviewer thought little of it: \"Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, with the goal of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old \"Night of the Living Dead\". The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' \"Pink Flamingos\" (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as \"Rocky Horror\" generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.\n\nAsian martial arts films began appearing as imports regularly during the 1970s. These \"kung fu\" films as they were often called, whatever martial art they featured, were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong–produced movies of Bruce Lee and marketed to the same audience targeted by AIP and New World. Horror continued to attract young, independent American directors. As Roger Ebert explained in one 1974 review, \"Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground.\" The movie under consideration was \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\". Made by Tobe Hooper for less than $300,000, it became one of the most influential horror films of the 1970s. John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" (1978), produced on a $320,000 budget, grossed over worldwide and effectively established the slasher flick as horror's primary mode for the next decade. Just as Hooper had learned from Romero's work, \"Halloween\", in turn, largely followed the model of \"Black Christmas\" (1974), directed by \"Deathdream\"s Bob Clark.\n\nOn television, the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded with the introduction of the \"ABC Movie of the Week\" in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as \"The Ordeal of Patty Hearst\", which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as \"Human Wreckage\" and \"When Love Grows Cold\", FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as \"The California Kid\" (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. \"Nightmare in Badham County\" (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.\n\nThe reverberations of \"Easy Rider\" could be felt in such pictures, as well as in a host of theatrical exploitation films. But its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct—by 1973, the major studios were catching on to the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain basement. \"Rosemary's Baby\" had been a big hit, but it had little in common with the exploitation style. Warner Bros.' \"The Exorcist\" demonstrated that a heavily promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster: it was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. In William Paul's description, it is also \"the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema. ... [P]ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. \"The Exorcist\" made cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice.\" Writer-director George Lucas's \"American Graffiti\", a Universal production, did something similar. Described by Paul as \"essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish\", it was 1973's third-biggest film and, likewise, by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made. Even more historically significant movies with B themes and A-level financial backing would follow in their wake.\n\nMost of the B movie production houses founded during the exploitation era collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field's financial situation changed in the early 1980s. Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies, raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects. Intimations of the trend were evident as early as \"Airport\" (1970) and especially in the mega-schlock of \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972), \"Earthquake\" (1973), and \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974). Their disaster plots and dialogue were B-grade at best; from an industry perspective, however, these were pictures firmly rooted in a tradition of star-stuffed extravaganzas. \"The Exorcist\" had demonstrated the drawing power of big-budget, effects-laden horror. But the tidal shift in the majors' focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films: Steven Spielberg's creature feature \"Jaws\" (1975) and George Lucas's space opera \"Star Wars\" (1977) had each, in turn, become the highest-grossing film in motion picture history. \"Superman\", released in December 1978, had proved that a studio could spend on a movie about a children's comic book character and turn a big profit—it was the top box-office hit of 1979. Blockbuster fantasy spectacles like the original 1933 \"King Kong\" had once been exceptional; in the new Hollywood, increasingly under the sway of multi-industrial conglomerates, they would rule.\nIt had taken a decade and a half, from 1961 to 1976, for the production cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25%). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful \"Amityville Horror\" and the disastrous \"Meteor\" in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.\n\nDespite the mounting financial pressures, distribution obstacles, and overall risk, many genre movies from small studios and independent filmmakers were still reaching theaters. Horror was the strongest low-budget genre of the time, particularly in the slasher mode as with \"The Slumber Party Massacre\" (1982), written by feminist author Rita Mae Brown. The film was produced for New World on a budget of $250,000. At the beginning of 1983, Corman sold New World; New Horizons, later Concorde–New Horizons, became his primary company. In 1984, New Horizons released a critically applauded movie set amid the punk scene written and directed by Penelope Spheeris. \"The New York Times\" review concluded: \"\"Suburbia\" is a good genre film.\"\n\nLarry Cohen continued to twist genre conventions in pictures such as \"Q\" (a.k.a. \"Q: The Winged Serpent\"; 1982), described by critic Chris Petit as \"the kind of movie that used to be indispensable to the market: an imaginative, popular, low-budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources, and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it.\" In 1981, New Line put out \"Polyester\", a John Waters movie with a small budget and an old-school exploitation gimmick: Odorama. That October \"The Book of the Dead\", a gore-filled yet stylish horror movie made for less than $400,000, debuted in Detroit. Its writer, director, and co-executive producer, Sam Raimi, was a week shy of his twenty-second birthday; star and co-executive producer Bruce Campbell was twenty-three. It was picked up for distribution by New Line, retitled \"The Evil Dead\", and became a hit. In the words of one newspaper critic, it was a \"shoestring \"tour de force\".\"\n\nOne of the most successful 1980s B studios was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, Troma Pictures, founded in 1974. Troma's most characteristic productions, including \"Class of Nuke 'Em High\" (1986), \"Redneck Zombies\" (1986), and \"Surf Nazis Must Die\" (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma's best-known production is \"The Toxic Avenger\" (1985); its hideous hero, affectionately known as Toxie, was featured in several sequels and a TV cartoon series. One of the few successful B studio startups of the decade was Rome-based Empire Pictures, whose first production, \"Ghoulies\", reached theaters in 1985. The video rental market was becoming central to B film economics: Empire's financial model relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals, but only later, at the video store. A number of Concorde–New Horizon releases went this route as well, appearing only briefly in theaters, if at all. The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low-budget film industry, as many B movies quickly wound up as \"filler\" material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose.\n\nBy 1990, the cost of the average U.S. film had passed . Of the nine films released that year to gross more than at the U.S. box office, two would have been strictly B movie material before the late 1970s: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and \"Dick Tracy\". Three more—the science-fiction thriller \"Total Recall\", the action-filled detective thriller \"Die Hard 2\", and the year's biggest hit, the slapstick kiddie comedy \"Home Alone\"—were also far closer to the traditional arena of the Bs than to classic A-list subject matter. The growing popularity of home video and access to unedited movies on cable and satellite television along with real estate pressures were making survival more difficult for the sort of small or non-chain theaters that were the primary home of independently produced genre films. Drive-in screens were rapidly disappearing from the American landscape.\n\nSurviving B movie operations adapted in different ways. Releases from Troma now frequently went straight to video. New Line, in its first decade, had been almost exclusively a distributor of low-budget independent and foreign genre pictures. With the smash success of exploitation veteran Wes Craven's original \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984), whose nearly cost it had directly backed, the company began moving steadily into higher-budget genre productions. In 1994, New Line was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System; it was soon being run as a midsized studio with a broad range of product alongside Warner Bros. within the Time Warner conglomerate. The following year, Showtime launched \"Roger Corman Presents\", a series of thirteen straight-to-cable movies produced by Concorde–New Horizons. A \"New York Times\" reviewer found that the initial installment qualified as \"vintage Corman ... spiked with everything from bared female breasts to a mind-blowing quote from Thomas Mann's \"Death in Venice\".\"\n\nAt the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the \"sophisticated\" arthouse picture. Director Abel Ferrara, who built a reputation with violent B movies such as \"The Driller Killer\" (1979) and \"Ms. 45\" (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: \"King of New York\" (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of \"Bad Lieutenant\" (1992), , was financed totally independently. Larry Fessenden's micro-budget monster movies, such as \"No Telling\" (1991) and \"Habit\" (1997), reframe classic genre subjects—Frankenstein and vampirism, respectively—to explore issues of contemporary relevance. The budget of David Cronenberg's \"Crash\" (1996), , was not comfortably A-grade, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: \"On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's \"Crash\" suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick\", wrote critic Janet Maslin. Financed, like \"King of New York\", by a consortium of production companies, it was picked up for U.S. distribution by Fine Line Features. This result mirrored the film's scrambling of definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division. \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino on a budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines, as James Mottram describes: \"With its art house narrative structure, B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect.\"\n\nBy the turn of the millennium, the average production cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the mark. In 2005, the top ten movies at the U.S. box office included three adaptations of children's fantasy novels, one extending and another initiating a series (\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" and \"\", respectively), a child-targeted cartoon (\"Madagascar\"), a comic book adaptation (\"Batman Begins\"), a sci-fi series installment (\"\"), a sci-fi remake (\"War of the Worlds\"), and a \"King Kong\" remake. It was a slow year for Corman: he produced just one movie, which had no American theatrical release, true of most of the pictures he had been involved in over the preceding decade. As big-budget Hollywood movies further usurped traditional low-rent genres, the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt. \"New York Times\" critic A. O. Scott warned of the impending \"extinction\" of \"the cheesy, campy, guilty pleasures\" of the B picture.\nOn the other hand, recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something like the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer \"programmers\" bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone, \"The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around $, rising to $ when the cost of marketing for domestic launch (USA only) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120–) and niche features ($5–20m). ... Fewer $30– releases are expected.\" Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006, Fox Atomic, to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films. The economic model was deliberately low-rent, at least by major studio standards. According to a \"Variety\" report, \"Fox Atomic is staying at or below the mark for many of its movies. It's also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally—a cheaper process that results in a grittier, teen-friendly look. And forget about stars. Of Atomic's nine announced films, not one has a big name\". The newfangled B movie division was shut down in 2009.\n\nAs the \"Variety\" report suggests, recent technological advances greatly facilitate the production of truly low-budget motion pictures. Although there have always been economical means with which to shoot movies, including Super 8 and 16 mm film, as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape, these mediums could not rival the image quality of 35 mm film. The development of digital cameras and postproduction methods now allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent, and not necessarily \"grittier\", image quality and editing effects. As Marone observes, \"the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features. At the same time, [since the early 2000s], the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically.\" Independent filmmakers, whether working in a genre or arthouse mode, continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels, though digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new opportunities. In a similar way, Internet sites such as YouTube have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low-budget motion pictures.\n\nThe terms \"C movie\" and the more common \"Z movie\" describe progressively lower grades of the B movie category. The terms \"drive-in movie\" and \"midnight movie\", which emerged in association with specific historical phenomena, are now often used as synonyms for \"B movie\".\n\nThe C movie is the grade of motion picture at the low end of the B movie, or—in some taxonomies—simply below it. In the 1980s, with the growth of cable television, the C grade began to be applied with increasing frequency to low-quality genre films used as filler programming for that market. The \"C\" in the term then does double duty, referring not only to quality that is lower than \"B\" but also to the initial \"c\" of \"cable.\" Helping to popularize the notion of the C movie was the TV series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" (1988–99), which ran on national cable channels (first Comedy Central, then the Sci Fi Channel) after its first year. Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over three decades before, \"MST3K\" presented cheap, low-grade movies, primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films' shortcomings. Director Ed Wood has been called \"the master of the 'C-movie in this sense, although \"Z movie\" (see below) is perhaps even more applicable to his work. The rapid expansion of niche cable and satellite outlets such as Sci Fi (with its Sci Fi Pictures) and HBO's genre channels in the 1990s and 2000s has meant a market for contemporary C pictures, many of them \"direct to cable\" movies—small budget genre films never released in theaters.\n\nThe term Z movie (or grade-Z movie) is used by some to characterize low-budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even C movies. Most films referred to as Z movies are made on very small budgets by operations on the fringes of the commercial film industry. The micro-budget \"quickies\" of 1930s fly-by-night Poverty Row production houses may be thought of as Z movies \"avant la lettre\". The films of director Ed Wood, such as \"Glen or Glenda\" (1953) and \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1959)—frequently cited as one of the worst pictures ever made—exemplify the classic grade-Z movie. Latter-day Zs are often characterized by violent, gory or sexual content and a minimum of artistic interest; much of which is destined for the subscription TV equivalent of the grindhouse.\n\nPsychotronic movie is a term coined by film critic Michael J. Weldon—referred to by a fellow critic as \"the historian of marginal movies\"—to denote the sort of low-budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment. Weldon's immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film \"The Psychotronic Man\" (1980), whose title character is a barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy. According to Weldon, \"My original idea with that word is that it's a two-part word. 'Psycho' stands for the horror movies, and 'tronic' stands for the science fiction movies. I very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie.\" The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon's such as \"The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film\" and \"Psychotronic Video\" magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans. Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as camp.\n\nB-television is the term used by the German media scholar in his article \"From the True, the Good, the Beautiful to the Truly Beautiful Goods—audience identification strategies on German \"B-Television\" programs\" as an analogy to \"B-movie\" to characterize the development of German commercial television, which adopted \"the aesthetics of commercials\" with its \"inane positiveness radiated by every participant, the inclusion of clips, soft focus, catchy music\" as well as \"promotion of merchandise through product placement\". Schumacher notes that after 1984 deregulation German public television passed its climax and became marginalized. Newly established commercial stations, operating without the burden of societal legitimacy, focused solely on profitability. To establish and maintain viewer loyalty these stations would broadcast reality shows, sensational journalism, daily soap operas, infotainment programs, talk shows, game shows and soft pornography.\n\n\"Appeals to viewer emotions and the active participation of the consumer enhance the ability of 'B-TV' to exploit the market\", concludes Schumacher.\n\n\n"}

He was a popular people’s saint-poet of Rajputana, now Rajasthan, India, who was an accomplished yogi also and is remembered as Patanjali and Valmiki of Rajasthan.\n\nChatur Singhji was born on 9 February 1880 (V. S. Magh Krishn 14, 1936) at Karjali Haveli to Rani Krishna Kunwar and Maharaj Surat Singh of Karjali. The Karjali family descend from Maharaj Bagh Singh, the third son of Maharana Sangram Singh II of Mewar (Udaipur. Chatur Singhji was youngest of four brothers. Bavji married at the age of 19 years and had two daughters, one died as a child while the other Sayar Kunwar was married to Maharaj Hamir Singhji of Vijaynagar, Gujarat.\n\nSinghji was a popular people’s saint-poet of Rajputana, now Rajasthan, India, who was an accomplished yogi also and is remembered as Patanjali and Valmiki of Rajasthan.\n\nBavji spread the ancient Indian knowledge through a simple language that a lay man could comprehend which helped him in his mission for social reform, but with preservation of Rajasthan’s culture and heritage. He effectively propagated promotion of education through \"\"Ramat-Bhanat\" concept (रमत-भणत् य़ोजना what is now popular as play-way child education). For his adult education and literacy mission, Bavji spread the concept of \"Seekho-Kamao-Khao\"\" सीखो-कमाओ-खाओ –\"Learn-Earn-Sustain\" (an earlier example of earn-while-you-learn concept, but the significance of the third component of \"Sustain/Maintain\" is now being realized after the Global Economic Meltdown of 2008). Bavji was strong advocate of imparting education to all the children/uneducated adults in their own mother tongue, for which he wrote easy to understand booklets too, they should be adopted for promotion of education in rural areas.\n\nSinghji lived during the reign of Maharana Fateh Singh (reign 1884-1930), who was his uncle. The death of his wife in 1907 and then his daughter, without issue, one year after her marriage drove him further towards spiritual pursuits. He moved from the Karjali Haveli in Udaipur to Telion-ki-Sarai, where the present-day BN College is located, and then to a modest cottage (KOTRI) on Hawa Magri at Sukher. He later moved to the other Karjali thikana village of Nauwa.\n\nSinghji died at Karjali Haveli on 1 July 1929, aged 49, following a brief illness.\n\nBavji propagated the spiritual and social reformist knowledge of humanity in mother tongue of the local public (Rajasthan) and wrote both prose and poetry. His major works during the short span of about seven years (1922–1929) are given below :\n\nThe Academy for Rajasthani Language, Literature, & Culture has instituted an annual award in honour of Singhji. Known as the Bavji Chatur Singhji Anuvaad Puruskaar (Bavji Chatur Singhji Translation Award) it is given for translation of worthy literary work into the Rajasthani language. It has a monetary value of Rs. 30,000.\n\nMaharana Bhagwat Singhji Mewad (reign 1955-1984) republished Bavji’s major literary works during his birth centenary year (1980) and set up a room in Bavji's honour in the City Palace Museum, Udaipur.\n\nThe spiritual journal \"Kalyan\"\" published special issues on BHAGTA-ANK (1928) and YOGANK (1935) in which Bavji’s literature, philosophy, and contributions were discussed.\n\nThe Rajasthani writer and social activist Lakshmi Kumari Chundawat dedicated her book \"Moomal\" (1961) to Bavji Chatur Singhji.\n\nBavji’s kotri at Khaanu Mangri was opened by Niranjan Nath Acharya, the then Speaker of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, on 13 January 1966 after restoration supported by the Maharana Mewar Foundation and Karjali family.

{"id": "4363276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4363276", "title": "Bench-clearing brawl", "text": "Bench-clearing brawl\n\nA bench-clearing brawl, sometimes known as a basebrawl or a rhubarb, is a form of ritualistic fighting that occurs in sports, most notably baseball and ice hockey, in which every player on both teams leave their dugouts, bullpens or benches, and charge the playing area in order to fight one another or try to break up a fight.\n\nIn baseball, brawls are usually the result of escalating infractions, often stemming from a player being hit by a pitch, or an altercation between a baserunner and infielder stemming from excessive contact in an attempted tag out (such as a runner crashing into the catcher at home plate in an attempt to dislodge the ball, which is an offensive interference violation that may result in ejection). They are also known to occur when a batter charges the mound. However, few bench-clearing brawls result in serious injury, as in most cases, no punches are thrown, and the action is limited to pushing and shoving.\n\nUnlike most other team sports, in which teams usually have an equivalent number of players on the field at any given time, in baseball the hitting team is at a numerical disadvantage, with a maximum of five players (batter, up to three runners, and on-deck batter) and two base coaches on the field at any time, compared to the fielding team's nine players. For this reason, leaving the dugout to join a fight is generally considered acceptable in that it results in numerical equivalence on the field, a fairer fight, and a generally neutral outcome, as in most cases, managers and/or umpires will intervene to restore order and resume the game. In at least one case (the infamous Ten Cent Beer Night promotion), one team (the Cleveland Indians, who were the home team) left its dugout to defend the other (the Texas Rangers, the visiting team) from its own fans (who had stormed the field). \n\nDepending on the severity of the unsportsmanlike conduct, an umpire may or may not eject a brawl's participants. Since a bench-clearing brawl by definition involves \"everyone\" on both teams, it is exceedingly unlikely that all participants will be ejected, but the player or players responsible for the precipitating event are often ejected. Fines and suspensions generally result and are issued at a later date.\n\nFighting in ice hockey by enforcers is an established, if unofficial, part of the sport (especially in North America, where the penalty rules are more permissive); the general procedure in a one-on-one fight is to let it pan out and then send both players to the penalty box with five-minute major penalties. Escalations beyond isolated fights, such as line brawls between groups of players on the ice, are prohibited, meaning bench-clearing brawls will result in serious consequences. General brawls can result in players being assessed game misconduct penalties and ejected from the game. This is especially the case if a player leaves the bench or penalty box to join a fight.\n\nAs in baseball, hockey brawls usually result from escalating infractions; in this case, dangerous hits, excessive post-whistle roughness, taking shots after the whistle, attacking the goaltender, and hatred from competition in a game with a significant amount of inter-player violence, all contribute to bench-clearing brawls.\n\nIn the National Hockey League the penalties include, in addition to in-game penalties, an automatic 10-game suspension and a fine of $10,000 for the first player to leave his bench or the penalty box to participate in a brawl; for the second player to leave his bench or the penalty box, the penalties include, in addition to in-game penalties, an automatic five-game suspension and a fine of $5,000.\n\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation rules prescribe a double minor penalty plus a game misconduct penalty for the first player to leave the bench during an altercation and a misconduct penalty for other such players; a player who leaves the penalty box during an altercation is assessed a minor penalty plus a game misconduct penalty. In addition to these penalties for leaving the bench, all players engaging in a fight may be penalized.\n\nOne of the more notable incidents was the Punch-up in Piestany, a game between Canada and the Soviet Union during the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. The game was rougher and more dangerous than is generally accepted, and with 6:07 left in the second period, a wild fight broke out between Pavel Kostichkin and Theoren Fleury, causing both teams to leave the benches for 20 minutes. The officials ordered that the arena lights be turned out, but to no avail, and the IIHF eventually declared the game void. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada a potential gold medal, and the Canadian team, disgusted at what they perceived to be a conspiracy against them, chose to leave rather than stay for the end-of-tournament festivities, from which the Soviet team were banned.\n\nA notable KHL bench-clearing brawl saw all the players of Avangard Omsk and Vityaz Chekhov, except for the goaltenders, fighting at 3 minutes and 34 seconds. The referees penalized all the players who were involved in the brawl, and called the game due to lack of players; the teams were fined 5.7 million rubles and had the game counted as a double loss.\n\nBench-clearing brawls have also been known to occur in other sports, and officials in those sports have been cracking down on such brawls; in 1995, the National Basketball Association changed the penalty for leaving the bench to participate in a brawl from a $500 fine to an automatic one-game suspension.\n\nIn 2010, the Northern Territory Football League in Australia ruled that any player found to have left the interchange bench to participate in a melee would be ejected from that match; they would also have their melee fine increased by 25% and receive an automatic one-game suspension.\n\nBench-clearing brawls do not occur very often in gridiron football. All levels of the game penalize any \"substitute who leaves the team box during a fight\" (as it is worded in the high school rule books) with automatic ejection and possible further sanctions depending on the league, and the amount of equipment a football player wears increases the risk for injury in a brawl greatly. In addition, on-field umpires and referees move in immediately to break up fights, and any contact by a team member against an official will draw the immediate penalty of ejection from the game, with further sanctions by league officials virtually certain, along with on-field penalties that move the ball closer or farther from the goal line depending on the team sanctioned, hurting the team's winning chances far more than in other sports. One notable brawl at the college level was between Florida International University and the University of Miami, where tough talk between two crosstown rivals escalated into a brawl with severe consequences for FIU.\n\nAt least two bench-clearing brawls have taken place in the Lingerie Football League, since renamed the Legends Football League. The first came in 2009 between the Miami Caliente and the New York Majesty; that brawl eventually led to the Majesty suspending operations. Another occurred during the December 9, 2011 LFL game between the Toronto Triumph and the Philadelphia Passion. It was unclear what punishment either team would face as Toronto was already using replacement players due to a mass walkout of the original team earlier in the year.\n\nBench-clearing brawls are prohibited in scholastic competition with the National Federation of State High School Associations specifying the penalty for leaving the bench area to participate in a fight in any sanctioned sport as an automatic ejection and, if actively involved in a fight, an automatic suspension. In addition, school administrators may implement more severe penalties such as disqualification from activities, academic suspension or expulsion. In more severe instances, entire schools can face sanctions from their state's athletic association, ranging from letters of reprimand, forfeiture of contests, withholding of travel expenses and extended suspensions of players and coaches to, in the most severe cases, cancellation of a team's entire season or suspension of a school's entire athletic program.\n\n"}

Her literary work, mainly written in German, covers romantic stories about the legendary feats of hajduk heroes. They brought her commercial success in both German-speaking Europe and Romania, and were prefaced by Queen-consort Elisabeth of Wied.\n\nDumbravă promoted many causes, and was involved with several cultural projects, but is mainly remembered for her activity in promoting tourism and environmentalism in Romania. She was an avid traveler and mountaineer, who established some of the country's first hiking clubs. Her travel writing remains a standard in Romanian literature, even though her fiction work is generally forgotten.\n\nThroughout most of her career, Szekulics promoted the inclusion of women in the Romanian Freemasonry. In old age, her essays came to focus on Spiritualist subjects, and, as disciple of Jiddu Krishnamurti, set up the Romanian lodge of the Theosophical Society. She died on her return trip from the British Raj, having attended the Theosophical Conference in Adyar.\n\nThe future writer was born in the city of Bratislava (\"Pressburg\"). Her father was either Hungaro-Slovak or Slovak-Hungarian. On her mother's side, she was ethnic German. Dumbravă herself was raised into German culture, and therefore perceived as a German. Fanny spent her earliest childhood moving between the various parts of Austria-Hungary, visiting Vienna at age 4. A year later, her family had emigrated to the Kingdom of Romania, as friends of the Romanian King, Carol I. Her father worked as an insurance executive, and is credited by some historians with being supervisor of the Masonic Lodge \"zur Brüderlichkeit\".\n\nThe royal family soon took notice of Fanny's piano-playing, of her talent for writing German-language poetry, and of her passion for reading Romanian romantic literature. At the court in Sinaia, she became a confidant and lady-in-waiting of Queen Elisabeth and, in July 1884, made her entry into high society as a guest of the royal couple.\n\nIn 1886, Fanny Szekulics became a philanthropist and social activist, founding Tibișoiul Society and providing Sunday school for lower-class children. In later years, she was mainly active as a music critic, art promoter, researcher at the Romanian Academy and lecturer on religious subjects, working with sculptor Carol Storck and musicologist Ion Popescu-Pasărea. In 1905, she established, together with politician Vintilă Brătianu, Chindia Society, for the preservation and cultivation of Romanian folklore, specifically folk dances. She was joined there by socialite Frozy Nenițescu, who recalled that, at least originally, the society fought against oriental influences in Romanian dress and shunned the \"noise-making\" \"tarafuri\", and was in turn criticized for its \"exclusivity\". Their work was documented in a 1913 film by Nicolae Barbelian, which commits to cultural memory ten individual national dances taught at Chindia.\n\nFanny followed her father's Masonic beliefs and joined into the controversial \"Rites of Adoption\" Masonry. She corresponded with Annie Besant and \"Le Droit Humain\", becoming recognized as Diva of the Rosy Cross 9th Degree, and probably used the Chindia group in the recruitment of new members.\n\nSzekulics' first published volume is \"Der Haiduck\" (\"The Hajduk\"), printed by W. Wunderling of Regensburg in 1908. The same year, translated by Teodor Nica, it saw print with Carol Sfetea of Bucharest, as \"Haiducul\" (second edition and third, 1911; fourth edition, 1914). Pseudonymous, the book enjoyed the allure of mystery, and some assumed that it was in fact a literary attempt by Queen Elisabeth. The latter had in fact suggested Szekulics' pen name, which echoes the mountainous surroundings of Sinaia: Lake Bucura and the common noun \"dumbravă\" (\"grove\").\n\nA historical novel, \"Der Haiduck\" was described in \"Mercure de France\" as a fresco of \"Romania's first patriots\", with an \"entrapping subject matter\" and a \"perfectly adequate sobriety\" of tone. In Transylvania, critic Ilarie Chendi reported being pleasantly surprised by both the book and the good reception it received in Germany. According to Chendi, the work was notable for its sympathetic depiction of the Romanian peasants, with their \"clean and ancient way of life\". Critics were drawn to Szekulics' minute historical research, which included the verification of historical records in the Hurmuzachi collection, but also inspiration from the popular novels of N. D. Popescu-Popnedea. More controversially, she borrowed heavily from a family manuscript on hajduk Iancu Jianu, and was therefore suspected of plagiarism. The work was also criticized for perpetuating the negative myth of Nikola Abraš (or \"Iabraș\"), Jianu's main ally, as a traitor to the hajduk insurgency.\n\n\"Der Haiduck\" came out a second time, in 1912, with a foreword by Elisabeth (signed with her pen name, \"Carmen Sylva\"). The same year, Dumbravă completed her \"history of the Wallachian uprising of 1821\", as \"Der Pandur\" (\"The Pandur\"). It too was published by Wunderling in Germany, and, in Eliza Brătianu's translation, by Carol Sfetea, before being entirely redone in Romanian by the author herself. The narrative centers on the folk hero Tudor Vladimirescu, depicted as the impersonation of national awakening, but also as a ruthless commander and a blunt politician.\n\n\"Der Pandur\" was a sequel to \"Der Haiduck\". The final part of this trilogy, focusing on the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, was burned, by accident, before it could be published. Dumbravă never returned to it, but, by 1918, was conceiving of another novel, tentatively called \"Book of Sibyl\". She still registered success as an amateur musician. In 1913, at Elisabeth's Peleș Castle, her piano-playing accompanied famous the Romanian violinists George Enescu and Dimitrie Dinicu.\n\nDuring those decades, the friendship between Dumbravă and Queen Elisabeth centered on their shared interest for hiking through the Southern Carpathians, to and from Sinaia. For Dumbravă, traveling was already a weekly pastime. As recalled by witnesses of these escapades, the physically unattractive and myopic Dumbravă was much admired for her joyful spirit and her adventure-seeking. She wore tailor-made mountaineer's clothes, rode a \"famous mare\" named Liza, and set up her main camp at the Ialomiței caves. According to Frozy Nenițescu, Dumbravă also took political risks, crossing back into Austria-Hungary, and irritating the Hungarian Border Guard officials with her presence.\n\nWith the discovery of this passion, Szekulics turned her attention to travel literature. According to comparatist Luiza Marinescu, her subsequent work should be regarded as fitting in with the Romanian tradition of \"descriptive romantic literature\" (Alexandru Odobescu, Alexandru Vlahuță, Calistrat Hogaș, Nicolae Iorga), but also as informing the German public about \"Romanian specificity\". More specifically, critic Mihail Dragomirescu suggests, Szekulics was a disciple of the \"Junimea\" society. Himself a member of \"Junimea\", Dragomirescu places the female novelist among the authors illustrating the neoromantic \"national ideal\" literature promoted, ca. 1900, by cultural theorist Titu Maiorescu.\n\nBy 1914, Fanny Szekulics was helping with Queen Elisabeth's charities, a member of the \"Ladies' Committee\" at the Queen Elisabeth Polyclinic, Bucharest, and a co-manager of Țesătoarea Career School. With Mărgărita Miller Verghy, Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan and other women writers, Sadoveanu was also a founding member of the \"Româncele Cercetașe\" Association, an early branch of Romanian Scouting, and, in this respect, predecessor the \"Asociația Ghidelor și Ghizilor din România\".\n\nSoon after, Carol I died, leaving Elisabeth a widow. Reportedly, Dumbravă was able to revive her friend's interest in hiking and literature even after this incident, and, together with the queen, began work on a book of meditation, the never-completed \"Cartea Îngerilor\" (\"Book of Angels\"). She delivered one of Elisabeth's funeral orations upon her death in November 1916.\n\nFanny Szekulics resumed her activity after World War I. While new editions of \"Haiducul\" came out in 1919 and 1925, Dumbravă put out editions of her best-selling new essays: \"Cartea munților\" (\"The Book of the Mountains\") and \"Ceasuri sfinte\" (\"Holy Hours\"). Her first works to be written directly in Romanian, they consolidated her reputation among conservatives and monarchists. According to M. Dragomirescu: \"\"Cartea munților\" [is] a masterpiece of sound Romanian inspiration and healthy language [...]. Therein is so much love of nature, so much intimacy with the mountains' godly beauties, [...] that it is, without doubt, one of the best works in our literature.\" At the traditionalist review \"Transilvania\", literary chronicler Ion Georgescu upheld \"Ceasuri sfinte\" as the antithesis of modernist literature, and as such \"a blessing on the Romanian soul\".\n\nThe new writings blended cultural activism, social ideals, and contemplation of natural beauty. \"Cartea munților\" thus stands out for promoting environmental protection, with exhortations such as: \"Demand, for each and all, the right to rest in the bosom of nature, the right to sunlight, to fresh air, to the green forest, to the thrills of the desire to climb up mountains\". She was welcoming in influences from the Western Spiritualists, quoting at length from Emanuel Swedenborg's views on the purified and purifying energy of the mountains, concluding: \"The discovery of alpine beauty has been a victory of soul over matter.\" Mystical, ethical and self-help subjects formed the bulk of \"Ceasuri sfinte\", which revives and reinterprets symbolic episodes from various religious sources: the Book of Jeremiah, the Biblical apocrypha, the Acts of the Apostles, Joan of Arc's call to arms, etc.\n\nSzekulics' literary fragments and chronicles were published in various magazines of the day, including \"Convorbiri Literare\", \"Ideea Europeană\", \"Cuget Românesc\", Henric Sanielevici's \"Curentul Nou\", Gala Galaction's \"Cultul Eroilor Noștri\", and George Bacaloglu's \"Cele Trei Crișuri\". Such essays included a 1919 introduction to the Synarchist ideas of Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre, explaining them as a superior mix of \"nationalism\" and \"humanitarianism\".\n\nDumbravă's activism resulted in the creation of modern national tourism associations: in 1921, \"Hanul Drumeților\" (Travelers' Inn), followed in 1925 by the Romanian Touring Club. She co-opted other locally famous hikers: physician Nestor Urechia, who is mentioned in her writings as \"The Great Bear\", geographer Mihai Haret, and writer Emanoil Bucuța of \"Boabe de Grâu\" journal, who recognized in her one of the founders of Romanian \"Carpathianism\". According to Bucuța, Dumbravă presided over a \"school\" of hiking, which was less daring and more accessible than the mountaineering promoted by her male colleagues.\n\nAt its height, the Touring Club enlisted 4,000 members, grouped into 12 regional subsections, publishing specialized topographic maps, marking tourist paths, and actively protecting the environment. The circle was joined by the young poet Luca Caragiale, who was supposed to compose verse for \"Cartea munților\", and by Mircea Eliade, the future novelist and historian of religions.\n\nDespite old age, Szekulics resumed her active lifestyle. In 1923, she was in Switzerland, where she climbed the Matterhorn, returning in 1925 to escalate one of the Mont Blanc glaciers. Back in Romania, she set up a regional standard for women's rock climbing, after reaching the summit of Omu Peak. She later settled in Bran borough, at Poarta village, where she intended to set up her own hostel.\n\nDuring the latter part of her life, Szekulics became an avid participant in Theosophy, a modern spiritual movement centered on the teachings of Helena Blavatsky. According to Bucuța, this was a natural step from her \"credo\", the love of travel as physical exercise, to her belief in eternal transition, or reincarnation. Together with E. F. D. Bertram of Ploiești, the writer founded Romania's first Theosophist Circle, \"Frăția\" (\"Brotherhood\"). Located at her Dorobanți townhouse, it was originally a section of the Theosophical Society chapter in France, but soon emancipated itself as an autonomous Society branch, and set up its own regional network.\n\nHer circle introduced Romanians to the writings of Jiddu Krishnamurti, with the 1924 collection \"La picioarele învățătorului\" (\"By the Feet of the Teacher\"), translated in her own hand. Like the other prominent Romanian Theosophists, Szekulics affiliated with the Romanian Masonic section, that paid obedience to the National Union of Lodges. She held Spiritist sessions at the Marmorosch Blank Hall, with Luca's brother, Mateiu Caragiale, and feminist Eugenia de Reuss Ianculescu as (more or less implicated) witnesses.\n\nSzekulics, called \"perhaps the most involved\" Romanian Theosophist by author Constantina Raveca Buleu, eventually presided upon the Theosophical Society's Romanian chapter (est. 1925). Her contributions as a cultural journalist saw print in several new papers, for instance the Theosophical Society sheet \"Știri și Însemnări\", Constantin Angelescu's \"Democrația\", and the Association of Christian Women's \"Foaia Noastră\". She was also involved as an auditor and reviewer for the feminist Romanian Women Writers' Society, alongside Sofia Nădejde and Laura Vampa.\n\nAs a result of her Theosophical conversion, Szekulics became fascinated with the concepts of Indian philosophy, and dreamed of traveling to the British Raj. She got her chance in late 1925, when she was invited to the Theosophical Society Conference, in Adyar. Frozy Nenițescu, who walked her off to Gara de Nord, recalls that Dumbravă was highly emotional traveling \"into the land of her dreams.\"\n\nDumbravă took the journey, arriving at Mumbai port, and then taking the Indian Railways to Chennai (Madras). At Adyar, she met Krishnamurti. She then took trips through the Bengal Presidency and the Kingdom of Mysore.\n\nHaving contracted malaria, Szekulics fell seriously ill on her way home. The ship she was on left her in Port Said, Egypt, where she was quickly transported to hospital. Her health worsened and she died there on January 26. According to legend, she had hoped to see the Carpathians, believing that only their sight could cure her. For reasons unknown, her body was cremated, and her ashes were transported back to Romania inside an Egyptian vase.\n\nShortly after her death, Fanny Szekulics was honored with a memorial piece in \"Convorbiri Literare\", signed by Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, the art historian and courtier. Similarly, \"Țara Noastră\" journal assessed: \"Her ashen hand [...] will find a good shelter in the soil of our country—a welcoming and loving mother to all those who understand her\". The Bucura Dumbravă Peak, located in the Bucegi and identified by some with the sacred \"Kogaionon\", was named in the writer's honor.\n\nHer last volume, grouping her letters, came out in 1927 as \"Pe drumurile Indiei. Cele din urmă pagini\" (\"On India's Roads. The Very Last Pages\"). Moreover, in 1928, \"Der Haiduck\" inspired a Romanian film, with Horia Igirosanu as director. Part of Szekulics' estate was passed on to Elena Râmniceanu and the Romanian Institute for Social Studies. It was set up as the annual Bucura Dumbravă Award for Ethics, and had as its first recipient Emanoil Bucuța. A \"friends of Bucura Dumbravă\" circle still reunited periodically in commemoration of her death, and, in 1934, published a tribute volume, \"Când trec anii\" (\"As Years Pass\").\n\nHer books went through several reprints, before, during, and after World War II, and inspired illustrations by woman artist Olga Greceanu. In 1942, \"Der Haiduck\" was used by C. N. Mihăilescu and Ion Șahighian as the basis for another feature film, \"Iancu Jianul\".\n\nDespite being relatively famous in her lifetime, Bucura Dumbravă was generally ignored by later schools of literary criticism. As noted by Luiza Marinescu, \"she was not included in neither Romanian literary histories nor German ones\" (with the exception of \"Enciclopedia Cugetarea\", 1940), and was disregarded for her presence on Queen Elisabeth's \"camarilla\". Writing in 1935, essayist Petru Comarnescu opined that Bucura Dumbravă's work had a \"local\" character, and was far less important than that of her modernist peers—Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu, Henriette Yvonne Stahl. Still, Perpessicius writes, \"Cartea munților\" survives as the \"\"vade mecum\" of hiking\".\n\nAuthors were more interested in her adventurous life and her Theosophical ideas. Completed shortly after her death, the novel \"Craii de Curtea-Veche\" by Mateiu Caragiale makes a sarcastic reference to her as \"the theosophist Papura Jilava\", briefly seen dancing with the antagonist. As a mystic who died mysteriously, Szekulics is notably mentioned in Mircea Eliade's 1940 novella, \"Secretul doctorului Honigberger\".\n\nAfter the establishment of a communist regime, Dumbravă's work, with its monarchist connections, was removed from the literary canon. In the Romanian diaspora, however, two more editions of her work were published (1954, 1956). At home, such reconsideration came in 1969, when historian Dumitru Almaș and Editura Tineretului republished Brătianu's 1912 translation; literary critic Mircea Handoca also put up a 1970 reprint of \"Cartea munților\", at Editura Stadion. A ballet adaptation of \"Haiducul\" was also produced by the Romanian National Opera, followed in 1982 by another \"Iancu Jianu\" film, with Dinu Cocea as director and Adrian Pintea as the star actor.\n\nStill, biographical entries on her were scarcely found in specialty works until the Romanian Revolution of 1989, when she came to be mentioned in standardized writers' dictionaries. In 2011, cartoonist Vali Ivan relied on her \"Der Haiduck\" to draw a graphic novel about the times of Iancu Jianu.\n\n"}

{"id": "502136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=502136", "title": "Color term", "text": "Color term\n\nA color term (or color name) is a word or phrase that refers to a specific color. The color term may refer to human perception of that color (which is affected by visual context) which is usually defined according to the Munsell color system, or to an underlying physical property (such as a specific wavelength of visible light). There are also numerical systems of color specification, referred to as color spaces.\n\nAn important distinction must be established between color and shape, these two attributes usually are used in conjunction with one another when describing in language. For example, being labeled as alternative parts of speech terms color term and shape term.\n\nPsychological conditions for recognition of colors exist, such as those who cannot discern colors in general (Aphantasia) or those who see colors as sound (Synesthesia)\n\nMonolexemic color words are composed of individual lexemes, or root words, such as \"red\", \"brown\", or \"olive\". Compound color words make use of adjectives (e.g. \"light brown\", \"sea green\") or compounded basic color words (e.g. \"yellow-green\").\n\nThere are many different dimensions by which color varies. For example, hue (shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple), saturation (\"deep\" vs. \"pale\"), and brightness or intensity make up the HSI color space. The adjective \"fluorescent\" in English refers to moderately high brightness with strong color saturation. Pastel refers to colors with high brightness and low saturation.\n\nSome phenomena are due to related optical effects, but may or may not be described separately from the color name. These include gloss (high-gloss shades are sometimes described as \"metallic\"; this is also a distinguishing feature of gold and silver), iridescence or goniochromism (angle-dependent color), dichroism (two-color surfaces), and opacity (solid vs. translucent).\n\nDifferent cultures have different terms for colors, and may also assign some color terms to slightly different parts of the human color space: for instance, the Chinese character 青 (pronounced in Mandarin and in Japanese) has a meaning that covers both blue and green; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of \"青\". In more contemporary terms, they are 藍 (, in Mandarin) and 綠 (, in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, (, derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb \"to be in leaf, to flourish\" in reference to trees) and (, which is derived from the English word \"green\"). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors that other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, , because green is considered a shade of ; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green \"shiso\" (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word .\n\nSimilarly, languages are selective when deciding which hues are split into different colors on the basis of how light or dark they are. English splits some hues into several distinct colors according to lightness: such as red and pink or orange and brown. To English speakers, these pairs of colors, which are objectively no more different from one another than light green and dark green, are conceived of as belonging to different categories. A Russian will make the same red / pink and orange / brown distinctions, but will also make a further distinction between and , which English speakers would simply call dark and light blue. To Russian speakers, and are as separate as red and pink, or orange and brown.\n\nSeveral researchers have studied the Ova-Himba perception of colors. The Ova-Himba use four color names: \"zuzu\" stands for dark shades of blue, red, green, and purple; \"vapa\" is white and some shades of yellow; \"buru\" is some shades of green and blue; and \"dambu\" is some other shades of green, red, and brown. It is thought that this may increase the time it takes for the Ova-Himba to distinguish between two colors that fall under the same Herero color category, compared to people whose language separates the colors into two different color categories.\n\nHungarian and Turkish have multiple words for \"red\": and (Hungarian; is a darker red), and , , and (Turkish); kırmızı now includes all reds but originally referred to crimson, to which it is cognate, while kızıl mainly refers to scarlet and other orange-tinted or brownish reds. Two words for \"red\" are also found in Irish and Scottish Gaelic ( for light, bright red and or respectively for dark, brownish red). Turkish also has two words for \"white\" ( and ) and \"black\" ( and ). Ak and beyaz have the same meaning, while kara is a broader term than siyah and also includes dark browns; which word is used also depends on the kind of object being described. Similarly, Irish uses two words for green: denotes the green color of plants, while describes artificial greens of dyes, paints etc. This distinction is made even if two shades are identical.\n\nIn the Komi language, green is considered a shade of yellow (, ), called (: \"grass yellow\".\n\nIn the Pirahã language, there may be no color words.\n\nHowever, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay, in their classic study of worldwide color naming \"\" (1969), argued that these differences can be organized into a coherent hierarchy, and that there are a limited number of universal \"basic color terms\" which begin to be used by individual cultures in a relatively fixed order. Berlin and Kay based their analysis on a comparison of color words in 20 languages from around the world. To be considered a basic color term, the words had to be\n\nBerlin and Kay's study further identified a culture state of color term recognition into stages (I-VII). Stage I only covers two terms white and black however these terms are referenced broadly to describe other undefined color terms. For example, the Jale highland group in New Guinea identify the color of blood as black. This is because at this stage I, white and black, are associated with which objects closer associates to the degree of brightness from which it has.\n\nWith stage II the recognition of another term red is developed. Objects are less consternated to their degree of brightness for classification and instead in this stage we see each term cover a larger scope of colors. Specifically blue and other darker shades described as black, yellow/orange colors lumped together with red, and the colors similar to white as white.\n\nAt stage III the identification of another term is acquired, however the newly acquired term differs but usually with either green (III a) or yellow (III b). At this stage there are more cultures who recognize yellow rather than green first. Currently there are two languages which identify green first, the Ibiobio Nigerian language and the Philippine language of Mindoro, Hanunoo.\n\nAt stage IV regardless of which term was acquired by a culture the term not defined is now acquired at this stage bringing the total terms to five.\n\nIn short, their analysis showed that in a culture with only two terms, they would roughly correlate with \"dark\" (covering black, dark colors, and cold colors such as blue) and \"bright\" (covering white, light colors, and warm colors such as red). All languages with three colors terms would add red to this distinction. Thus, the three most basic colors are black, white, and red. Additional color terms are added in a fixed order as a language evolves: first one of green or yellow; then the other of green or yellow; then blue. All languages distinguishing six colors contain terms for black, white, red, green, yellow, and blue. These colors roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells, leading Berlin and Kay to argue that color naming is not merely a cultural phenomenon, but is one that is also constrained by biology—that is, language is shaped by perception. A 2012 study suggested that the origin of this hierarchy may be tied to human vision and the time ordering in which these color names get accepted or agreed upon in a population perfectly matches the order predicted by the hierarchy.\n\nAs languages develop, they next adopt a term for brown; then terms for orange, pink, purple or gray, in any order. Finally, a basic light/dark relativistic term appears: such as \"light\" blue / \"dark\" blue (in comparison to blue sky / blue ocean), or \"pale\" red / \"deep\" red.\n\nThe proposed evolutionary trajectories as of 1999 are as follows. Eighty percent of sampled languages lie along the central path.\n\nToday every natural language that has words for colors is considered to have from two to twelve basic color terms. All other colors are considered by most speakers of that language to be variants of these basic color terms. English contains eleven basic color terms: \"black\", \"white\", \"red\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"blue\", \"brown\", \"orange\", \"pink\", \"purple\", and \"grey\". Italian, Russian and Hebrew have twelve, distinguishing blue and azure. That doesn't mean English speakers cannot describe the difference of the two colors, of course; however, in English, \"azure\" is not a basic color term because one can say \"bright sky blue\" instead, while \"pink\" is basic because speakers do not say \"light red\".\n\nColor words in a language can also be divided into abstract color words and descriptive color words, though the distinction is blurry in many cases. Abstract color words are words that only refer to a color. In English white, black, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, and gray are abstract color words. These words also happen to be 'basic color terms' in English as described above, but colors like maroon and magenta are also abstract though they may not be considered 'basic color terms', either because they are considered by native speakers to be too rare, too specific, or subordinate hues of more basic colors (red in the case of maroon, or purple/pink in the case of magenta).\n\nDescriptive color words are words that are secondarily used to describe a color but primarily used to refer to an object or phenomenon. \"Salmon\", \"rose\", \"saffron\", and \"lilac\" are descriptive color words in English because their use as color words is derived in reference to natural colors of salmon flesh, rose flowers, infusions of saffron pistils, and lilac blossoms respectively. Often a descriptive color word will be used to specify a particular hue of basic color term (salmon and rose [descriptive] are both hues of pink).\n\nColors in some languages may be denoted by descriptive color words even though other languages may use an abstract color word for the same color; for example in Japanese pink is (, lit. \"peach-color\") and gray is either or (, , lit. \"ash-color\" for light grays and \"mouse-color\" for dark grays respectively); nevertheless, as languages change they may adopt or invent new abstract color terms, as Japanese has adopted () for pink and () for gray from English. \"Vaaleanpunainen\", the Finnish word for \"pink\" is a clear agglutination of the language's words for \"white\" (\"valkoinen\") and \"red\" (\"punainen\").\n\nThe status of some color words as abstract or descriptive is debatable. The color \"pink\" was originally a descriptive color word derived from the name of a flower called a \"pink\" (see dianthus); however, because the word \"pink\" (flower) has become very rare whereas \"pink\" (color) has become very common, many native speakers of English use \"pink\" as an abstract color word alone and furthermore consider it to be one of the basic color terms of English. The name \"purple\" is another example of this shift, as it was originally a word that referred to a dye (see Tyrian purple).\n\nThe word \"orange\" is difficult to categorize as abstract or descriptive because both its uses, as a color word and as a word for an object, are very common and it is difficult to distinguish which of the two is primary. As a basic color term it became established in the early to mid 20th century; before that time artist's palettes called it \"yellow-red\". In English, the use of the word \"orange\" for a fruit predates its use as a color term. The word comes from French , which derives via Sanskrit from a Dravidian language such as Tamil or Tulu. The derived form \"orangish\" as a color is attested from the late 19th century by reference to the fruit. Nevertheless, \"orange\" (color) is usually given equal status to red, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, pink, gray, white and black (all abstract colors) in membership among the basic color terms of English. Based solely on current usage of the word, it would be impossible to distinguish whether the fruit is called an orange because of its color, or the color is so called after the fruit. (This problem is also illustrated by \"violet\" and \"indigo\".)\n\nIn Italian there is an adjective \"arancione\" different of and derived from the fruit name \"arancio\". In Portuguese, it is usual to distinguish the fruit \"laranja\" from the color name \"cor-de-laranja\", which means 'color-of-orange'. The same goes for \"Rosa\" ('rose') and \"cor-de-rosa\" ('color-of-rose'); and \"Violeta\" ('violet') and \"cor-de-violeta\" ('color-of-violet').\n\nResearch on color terms is often conducted without reference to common uses of the term or its significance within the context of its original language. In John A. Lucy's article \"The linguistics of \"color\"\" he identifies two key categories. One of these is \"characteristic referential range\", or the use of a color term to identify or differentiate a referent over a wide context.\n\nResearch across different languages and how they define a color term becomes increasingly difficult as differentiating and relying on traditional methods rather than cultural and intuition become problematic.\n\nSome examples of color naming systems are CNS and ISCC–NBS lexicon of color terms. The disadvantage of these systems, however, is that they only specify specific color samples, so while it is possible to, by interpolating, convert any color to or from one of these systems, a lookup table is required. In other words, no simple invertible equation can convert between CIE XYZ and one of these systems.\n\nPhilatelists traditionally use names to identify postage stamp colors. While the names are largely standardized within each country, there is no broader agreement, and so for instance the US-published Scott catalog will use different names than the British Stanley Gibbons catalogue.\n\nOn modern computer systems a standard set of basic color terms is now used across the web color names (SVG 1.0/CSS3), HTML color names, X11 color names and the .NET Framework color names, with only a few minor differences.\n\nThe Crayola company is famous for its many crayon colors, often creatively named.\n\nHeraldry has standardized names for \"tinctures\", subdivided into \"colors\", \"metals\", and \"furs\".\n\nEven the base word of a color has strong metaphorical resonances. For example, a linguistic study of Berlin and Kay study showed that the color red was almost always named at stage II due to the crucial importance of blood.\n\nModifiers expand and nuance the connotations of a color, as best seen in fashion and paint terminology, which seeks to imbue colors with emotional associations. Thus the same \"poppy yellow\" paint can become the hot-blooded \"amber rage\", the peaceful \"late afternoon sunshine\", or the wealth-evoking \"sierra gold\". The divisions of General Motors often give different names to the same colors featured on different car models. The attachment of an emotional context to a color may make it easier for a customer to decide among choices.\n\nNames given to the most vivid colors often include the word \"neon\", alluding to the bright glow of neon lighting. Dyes and inks producing these colors are often fluorescent, producing a luminous glow when viewed under a black light, and such pigments appear significantly brighter in mid-day overcast conditions due to a greater proportion of ultraviolet light.\n\n\n"}

The phrase originated in the 1700s as describing an act allowing a ship to make sail quickly in an urgent situation, either by cutting free an anchor or by cutting ropeyarns to unfurl sails from the yards on a square rig ship. Though initially referring to a literal act, the phrase was used figuratively by the mid-1800s in both the United States and England. The phrase is used as a pejorative in political language, implying a panicked and cowardly retreat, and it has been used by politicians in the United States, Great Britain, and Australia as a criticism of calls to withdraw troops, becoming particularly associated with the United States Republican Party.\n\nTo \"cut and run\" was defined by Englishman David Steel in 1794 as \"to cut the cable and make sail instantly, without waiting to weigh anchor\". He further described the practice as \"quick but very expensive\" but sometimes necessary, such as when the anchor is hooked on rocks and cannot be retrieved, in bad weather, when the anchor is on lee shore and the ship is in danger of embayment, or when one must quickly escape or pursue an enemy; instead of cutting the anchor by axe at the hawsehole, Steel offered an alternate method of slipping the anchor cable if time permitted, a method he felt wiser than cutting as it potentially prevented loss of anchor and cable. An alternate origin comes from the practice on square rig ships to furl the sails stopped to the yards with ropeyarns so that the yarns may be cut to let the sails fall unfurled should an urgent need to sail arise. The phrase was in use by the early 1700s, and \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cited the earliest printed usage of the phrase to \"The Boston News-Letter\" in 1704.\n\nThough \"cut and run\" initially referred to a literal act, the phrase later appeared in figurative usage in \"White-Jacket\" (1850) by American author Herman Melville and in \"Great Expectations\" (1861) by English author Charles Dickens. \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines the figurative, colloquial usage as \"to make off promptly\" or to \"hurry off\".\n\nIn May 2004, William Safire in \"The New York Times\" noted that the phrase, when used in reference to politics and war, lost its \"lighthearted sense\" and came to become a pejorative implying panic and \"cowardice, going beyond an honorable surrender\" and is \"said in derogation of a policy to be opposed with the utmost repugnance\". Dana Milbank characterized the phrase as a slogan used by members of United States Republican Party, and in December 2015, Robert Entman identified the phrase as one of numerous memes or slogans that \"trigger a series of instant, clear mental associations\" lending to the \"communicative success\" of the Republican Party. Linguist George Lakoff stated that the phrase is an example of the Republican Party's skill at \"distilling an issue to a simple phrase\" and analyzed the phrase as one that \"presupposes that the opposite is to stand and fight\".\n\nIn the United States, the phrase saw usage by politicians as a criticism against calls to withdraw from the Lebanese Civil War, Vietnam War, and Iraq War. It was also used in similarly in Australia in reference to the Iraq War and the 2015 War in Afghanistan and in Great Britain in reference to the Iraq War. The phrase was also used during the 2016 Republican presidential debates by Jeb Bush to describe Marco Rubio in reference to the Gang of Eight and immigration reform.\n\nVariations on the phrase were used by Ken Mehlman, then Chairperson of the United States Republican National Committee, to describe the Democratic Party's call to withdraw troops from the Iraq War: \"Some are saying we need to cut and run, others are saying we need to cut and jog, and still others are saying we need to cut and walk.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11464599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11464599", "title": "Ekoid languages", "text": "Ekoid languages\n\nThe Ekoid languages are a dialect cluster of Southern Bantoid languages spoken principally in southeastern Nigeria and in adjacent regions of Cameroon. They have long been associated with the Bantu languages, without their status being precisely defined. Crabb (1969) remains the major monograph on these languages, although regrettably, Part II, which was to contain grammatical analyses, was never published. Crabb also reviews the literature on Ekoid up to the date of publication.\n\nThe nearby Mbe language is the closest relative of Ekoid and forms with it the Ekoid–Mbe branch of Southern Bantoid.\n\n\"Ethnologue\" lists the following Ekoid varieties with the status of independent languages. Branching is from Watters (1978) and Yoder et al. (2009).\n\n\nProto-Ekoid is reconstructed with the following vowels and tones: ; high, low, rising, falling, and downstep. The rising and falling tones, though, might be composite.\n\nIt is thought to have the following consonants:\n\nThe first publication of Ekoid material is in Clarke (1848) where five ‘dialects’ are listed and a short wordlist of each is given. Other major early publications are Koelle (1854), Thomas (1914) and Johnston (1919–1922). Although Koelle lumped his specimens in the same area, it seems that Cust (1883) was the first to link them together and place them in a group co-ordinate with Bantu but not within it. Thomas (1927) is the first author to make a correct classification of Ekoid Bantu, but oddly the much later Westermann & Bryan (1952) repeats an older, inaccurate classification. This also propagated another old error and included the Nyang languages with Ekoid. Nyang languages have their own quite distinct characteristics and are probably further from Bantu than Ekoid.\n\nGuthrie (1967–1971) could not accept that Ekoid formed part of Bantu. His first improbable explanation was that its ‘Bantuisms’ resulted from speakers of a Bantu language being ‘absorbed’ by those who spoke a ‘Western Sudanic’ language, in other words, the apparent parallels, were simply a massive block of loanwords. This was later modified into ‘Ekoid languages may to some extent share an origin with some of the A zone languages, but they seem to have undergone considerable perturbations’ (Guthrie 1971, II:15). Williamson (1971) in an influential classification of Benue–Congo assigned Ekoid to ‘Wide Bantu’ or what would now be called Bantoid, a rather untidy mass of languages lying somehow between Bantu and the remainder of Benue–Congo.\n\nAll modern classifications of Ekoid are based on Crabb (1969) and when Watters (1981) came to explore the proto-phonology of Ekoid, he used this source, rather than his own field material from the Ejagham dialects in Cameroon. A problematic aspect of Crabb is his notation of Ekoid which does not clearly distinguish phonetic from phonemic transcription. Fresh work on Ejagham by Watters (1980, 1981) has extended our knowledge of the Cameroonian dialects of Ekoid. However, an important unpublished dissertation by Asinya (1987) based in fresh fieldwork in Nigeria made an important claim about Ekoid phonology, namely that most Ekoid languages have long/short distinctions in the vowels. Ekoid has raised particular interest among Bantuists because it has a noun-class system that seems close to Bantu and yet it cannot be said to correspond exactly (Watters 1980).\n\n"}

{"id": "568814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=568814", "title": "Hurro-Urartian languages", "text": "Hurro-Urartian languages\n\nThe Hurro-Urartian languages are an extinct language family of the Ancient Near East, comprising only two known languages: Hurrian and Urartian, both of which were spoken in the Taurus mountains area.\n\nHurro-Urartian was related neither to the Semitic (a branch of Afro-Asiatic, such as Aramaic, Amorite or Akkadian) nor to the Indo-European languages (such as Hittite, Persian or Armenian) of the region.\n\nIgor Diakonoff and others have suggested ties between the Hurro-Urartian languages and the Northeastern Caucasian languages. Several studies argue that the connection is quite certain.\n\nThe poorly attested Kassite language may have been related to Hurrian.\n\nHurrian was the language of the Hurrians (occasionally called \"Hurrites\"), and was spoken in the northern parts of Mesopotamia and Syria and the southeastern parts of Anatolia between at least last quarter of the third millennium BC and its extinction towards the end of the second millennium BC. There have been various Hurrian-speaking states, of which the most prominent one was the kingdom of Mitanni (1450–1270 BC). It has also been proposed that two little known groups, the Nairi and the Mannae, might have been Hurrian speakers, but as little is known about them, it is hard to draw any conclusions about what languages they spoke. Furthermore, the Kassite language was possibly related to Hurro-Urartian. Francfort and Tremblay on the basis of the Akkadian textual and archaeological evidence, proposed to identify the kingdom of Marhashi and Ancient Margiana. The Marhashite personal names seems to point towards an Eastern variant of Hurrian or another language of the Hurro-Urartian language family.\n\nThere was also a strong Hurrian influence on Hittite culture in ancient times, so many Hurrian texts are preserved from Hittite political centres. The Mitanni variety is chiefly known from the so-called \"Mitanni letter\" from Hurrian Tushratta to pharaoh Amenhotep III surviving in the Amarna archives. The \"Old Hurrian\" variety is known from some early royal inscriptions and from religious and literary texts, especially from Hittite centres.\n\nUrartian is attested from the late 9th century BC to the late 7th century BC as the official written language of the state of Urartu and was probably spoken by the majority of the population in the mountainous areas around Lake Van and the upper Zab valley. It branched off from Hurrian at approximately the beginning of the second millennium BC.\n\nIgor Diakonoff accepts a Hurro-Urartian etymology as plausible for thirteen lexemes in Old Armenian.\n\nBesides their fairly consistent ergative alignment and their generally agglutinative morphology (despite a number of not entirely predictable morpheme mergers), Hurrian and Urartian are also both characterized by the use of suffixes in their derivational and inflectional morphology (including ten to fifteen grammatical cases) and postpositions in syntax; both are considered to have the default order subject–object–verb, although there is significant variation, especially in Urartian. In both languages, nouns can receive a peculiar \"anaphoric suffix\" comparable (albeit apparently not identical) to a definite article, and nominal modifiers are marked by Suffixaufnahme (i.e. they receive a \"copy\" of the case suffixes of the head); in verbs, the type of valency (intransitive vs transitive) is signalled by a special suffix, the so-called \"class marker\". The complex morpheme \"chains\" of nouns and verbs follow roughly the same morpheme sequences in both languages. In nouns, the sequence in both languages is stem – article – possessive suffix – plural suffix – case suffix – agreement (Suffixaufnahme) suffix. In verbs, the portion of the structure shared by both languages is stem – valency marker – person suffixes. Most morphemes have fairly similar phonological forms in the two languages.\n\nDespite this structural similarity, there are also significant differences. In the phonology, written Hurrian only seems to distinguish a single series of phonemic obstruents without any contrastive phonation distinctions (the variation in voicing, though visible in the script, was allophonic); in contrast, written Urartian distinguishes as many as three series: voiced, voiceless and \"emphatic\" (perhaps glottalized). Urartian is also characterized by the apparent reduction of some word-final vowels to schwa (e.g. Urartian \"ulə\" vs Hurrian \"oli\" \"another\", Urartian \"eurišə\" vs Hurrian \"evrišše\" \"lordship\", Hurrian 3rd person plural enclitic pronoun \"-lla\" vs Urartian \"-lə\"). As the last two examples shows, the Hurrian geminates are also absent in Urartian.\n\nIn the morphology, there are differences as well. Hurrian indicates the plural of nouns through a special suffix \"-až-\", which only survives in fossilized form merged into some case endings in Urartian. Hurrian clearly marks tense or aspect through special suffixes (the unmarked form is the present tense) whereas Urartian has not been shown to do so in the attested texts (the unmarked form functions as a past tense). Hurrian has special negative verbal suffixes that negate a verb and are placed before the ergative person agreement suffixes; Urartian has no such thing and instead uses negative particles that are placed before the verb. In Hurrian, only the person of the \"ergative subject\" is marked obligatorily through a suffix in a verb form, whereas the \"absolutive\" subject or object is optionally marked with a pronominal enclitic that need not be attached to the verb and can also be attached to any other word in the clause. In Urartian, the ergative suffixes and the absolutive clitics have merged into a single set of obligatory suffixes that express the person of both the ergative and the absolutive participant and are an integral part of the verb. In general, the profusion of freely moving pronominal and conjunctional clitics that characterize Hurrian, especially that of the Mitanni letter, has few parallels in Urartian.\n\nUrartian is closer to the so-called Old Hurrian variety (mostly attested in Hittite documents) than to the Hurrian of the Mitanni letter. For example, both use \"-o-/-u-\" (rather than \"-i-\") as the marker of transitive valency and both display the plural suffix \"-it-\", expressing the number of the ergative subject and occupying a position before the valency marker.\n\n"}

In 1917 he joined Gandhi at the Kochrab Ashram and later went with him to the Sabarmati Ashram where he came to be regarded as an ideal ashram inmate. He taught at a school in the Ashram and later worked at the Navjivan Press.\n\nResponding to Gandhi's call for constructive work after the Non Cooperation Movement, Dave chose to work on rural development in Bardoli in the Surat district where he joined the Swaraj Ashram in 1924. In Bardoli, Dave's efforts focused on the landless bonded labourers called \"halpatis\" and the Raniparaj Adivasis both groups that were exploited by moneylenders, landlords and contractors. Dave focused on spreading education among these groups through the establishment of \"balwadis\" and \"ashramshalas\" and popularised the spinning wheel among them. While at the Bardoli ashram, he participated in the flood relief efforts in Gujarat in 1927. A Raniparaj Vidyalaya for the education of adivasis was established at Bardoli in 1926 which subsequently shifted to Vedchhi and it was here that Dave worked for the rest of his life.\n\nDave, along with Swami Anand, assisted Sardar Vallabhai Patel in the Bardoli Satyagraha on the wishes of Gandhi. Dave was tasked with covering the Sardar's speeches in Bardoli which he reported to Anand in Surat who in turn brought them to the larger public through newsletters. He served several terms in prison for his participation in the Salt Satyagraha, Individual Satyagraha and the Quit India Movement. He was also associated with the Charkha Sangh, the Talimi Sangh and the All India Village Industries Association.\n\nDave worked with Vinobha Bhave and Jaiprakash Narayan in the establishment of the Shanti Sena, an unarmed volunteer force that was formed in the aftermath of the Indo-China War of 1962, that undertook rural reconstruction work in the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) which had been an important theatre of the war. The Sena later undertook humanitarian work among the refugees from East Pakistan in the run up to the liberation of Bangladesh.\n\nDave was also deeply interested in issues of education. In 1967, the Vedchhi Ashram founded the Gandhi Vidyapith and the Shanti Sena Vidyalaya. He argued that in independent India basic educational curriculum must not only be productive and schooling rooted in society but also that it should emphasise on national ideas and character formation.\n\nDave was a noted Gujarati biographer who penned the biographies of several prominent leaders of the freedom struggle besides also writing children's literature. Some of his works include \"Our Bapu\", \"Prahlad\", a play for children, \"Atma Rachana\" on rural reconstruction and the autobiography \"Mari Jivanakatha\". He was awarded the Jamnalal Bajaj Award for \"outstanding contribution in constructive work\" in 1978.\n\nThe Jugatram Dave Ashram Schools Scheme of the Government of Gujarat which provides financial aid to voluntary organisations running ashram schools and to students studying there is named after him. \"Bapu na Jugatrambhai\" is a book by Prabhudas Gandhi that chronicles the bond between Gandhi and Dave.\n\n"}

He wrote vyangya (hindi satire) articles for almost every popular magazine of Hindi. His first book of satire Koi Patthar Se Na Mare was published in 1982. His style is unique and he is very popular among poets in Kavi Sammelans. He was an expert of three Indian language Urdu, Hindi and Awadhi.\nHe was awarded Padma Shri by Government of India, in year 2000. He died on 31 October 2013. He was a regular in Hindi Kavi Sammelan.\n\nThe diminutive KP Saxena was as ordinary as any elder living in old Lucknow.\n\nHis eyes and brows asked as well as answered questions as the mouth was often engaged in chewing the succulent 'paan ki gilauri'. A conversation with him could begin only when the taste buds were done with soaking the flavours wrapped in the 'beeda'. The sentences often began with 'amaa miyan aap bhi kamaal hain'. The phrase was followed by a qissa (anecdote) that unfolded with several rounds of bone tickling and ended with a social message that compelled introspection.\n\nConsider the satirical piece 'Bank Locker' which begins with 'aapki kasam sahibon, ek hamare pas bhi hai ... bank locker' – a style so Lakhnavi. \"Laakar (as locker is written in Hindi) samajhte hain na...\" KP asks in his distinct style. \"Jis mein laa, laa kar rakha jaye...\" he reveals even as the mind races to find a suitable answer. As the 'qissagoyi' (narration) proceeds, KP's pennilessness comes to the fore.\n\nAnd as always, Mirza is witness to his plight in the typical sentence, \"mere dost Mirza mere dard se waqif the..\" The high point comes when he launches a humorous attack on corrupt officials stating, \"afsaron ke laakar khole gaye to karoro rupyon ka desh prem baramad hua..\" It ends with the message that the empty locker of honesty should not be spoiled with offerings of bribery.\n\n\"His art of story telling was an embodiment of Lucknow's Ganga-Jamuni tehzib,\" says Sarvesh Asthana, city- based satirist. \"He generously used terms like 'amaa miyan' (hey you), barkhurdar (son), baat ka chalan (due course of conversation), fasad ki jad (root of trouble) , tabiyat hui ki (I felt like) any Lucknowite would relate with to weave his stories that wittily attacked cultural decay and social insensitivity,\" adds Asthana.\n\nHaving written more than 17,000 pieces in 50 years, KP introduced and established Lakhnavi lingo and way of life to the world of Hindi literature. A time came when his talent and style became the fourth pillar of Indian satire and humour as he joined the league of stalwarts like Harishankar Parsai, Sharad Joshi and Srilal Shukla. \"His demise has closed the chapter of Lakhnavi style humour and satire,\" said Asthana.\n\nA distinct KP satire always revolved around Mirza, Panditji or Bibi, the characters through whom he targeted the 'evil' around him. The piece was incomplete without the mention of paan ki gilauri and murgha (chicken). On many occasions, the 'paan ki gilauri' (laao zara ek gilauri to khilao, phir socha jaye) was medicinal for the thought process while murgha was the instrument to damn mindless actions ('murghe ki tarah baang de rahe ho', or 'murghe ki tarah ek taang pe kyo khade ho').\n\n\"The beauty of KP's style lies in its simplicity but the attack on the 'wrong' haunting his mind was always the punch,\" says Ashok Chakradhar, poet and satirist. For instance, he damned India's consistent poor show during the Olympics by stating, \"Olympic woh ghaat hai jahan hamare khiladi apna sar mundwate hain aur naak katwate hain magar doob ke mar nahin paate kyunki unke andar haad maas ki jagah shayad hawa bhari hui hai.\"\n\nTo acknowledge his immense contribution to Hindi literature, K.P.Saxena Vyangyakar Samman is awarded every year on his birth anniversary. For 2017, Suryakumar Pandey was awarded the K.P.Saxena Varishth Vyangyakar Samman.\n\nHe succumbed to a Cardiac Arrest on 31 October 2013 in Lucknow\n\n"}

The pilot is a navigational expert for the port of call. \n\nManeuvering a ship through the shallow water to berth / unberth in a port requires teamwork which involves, apart from the port pilot, the ship's captain (jointly responsible), ship's crew, port tugs, and shore linesmen. Since the pilot is on board the ship, they control the tugs and linesmen through a radio, and the ship directly. The ship's captain ensures their crew carry out the pilot's orders.\n\nHigh skill is required to be a pilot as the channels through which the ships move towards the port are normally too narrow and shallow for the size of the ships, with the stopping distance of the ships being only a few nautical miles and the fact that ships do not steer at slow speed. Even if a ship captain is a regular visitor to a certain port, they can not match the expertise and experience of the Pilot.\n\nIn an unfortunate case of an accident, high pollution is a risk as a ship may carry thousands of tonnes of fuel for her own consumption.(Clean up cost and other damages of the Exxon Valdez disaster was around $5 billion).\nAlso if a ship is wrecked in the channel, the channel and the port could be closed for months until the shipwreck is removed.\n\nMost ports have compulsory pilotage.\n\nLegally, the master has full responsibility for safe navigation of their vessel, even if a pilot is on board. If they have clear grounds that the pilot may jeopardize the safety of navigation, they can relieve the pilot from their duties and ask for another pilot or, if not compulsory to have a pilot on board, navigate the vessel without one. Only in transit of the Panama Canal and in Canada does the pilot have the full responsibility for the navigation of the vessel. \n\nIn English law, Section 742 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 defines a pilot as \"any person not belonging to a ship who has the conduct thereof.\" In other words, someone other than a member of the crew who has control over the speed, direction, and movement of the ship. The current United Kingdom legislation governing pilotage is the Pilotage Act 1987.\n\nPilotage is one of the oldest professions, as old as sea travel, and it is one of the most important in maritime safety. The oldest \"recorded\" history dates back to about the 7th century BC. The economic and environmental risk from today's large cargo ships makes the role of the pilot essential.\n\nThe work functions of the pilot go back to Ancient Greece and Roman times, when locally experienced harbour captains, mainly local fishermen, were employed by incoming ships' captains to bring their trading vessels into port safely. Eventually, because the act of pilotage needed to be regulated and to ensure that pilots had adequate insurance, the harbours licensed pilots. The California Board of Pilot Commissioners was the first government agency created by California's legislature, in 1850.\n\nBefore harbour boards were established, pilots known as hobblers would compete with one another. The first to reach an incoming ship would navigate it to the docks and receive payment. In Dún Laoghaire, Ireland, there is a monument to the hobblers who lost their lives. In Kent they were known as \"hovellers\" and worked alongside and in competition with the licensed pilots, but were sometimes blamed as wreckers. George Byng Gattie defends the hovellers or \"hobilers\" as lifesavers in his 1890 book about the Goodwin Sands.\n\nAlthough licensed by the harbour to operate within their jurisdiction, pilots were generally self-employed, and so had to have quick transport to get from the port to the incoming ships. As pilots were often still dual-employed, they used their own fishing boats to reach the incoming vessels. But fishing boats were heavy working boats, and filled with fishing equipment, hence a new type of boat was required.\n\nEarly boats were developed from single-masted cutters and twin-masted yawls, and later into the specialist pilot cutter. These were effectively light-weight and over-powered single masted boats with large steeply angled keels, making them deep draft under power and shallow draft in lighter sail. Joseph Henderson was an early American harbor pilot. He is well known for being a Sandy Hook Pilot for the New York harbor and along the Atlantic Coast during the Civil War. \n\nSome historic pilot vessels are still sailing:\nThe \"Zodiac\" and \"Adventuress\" are both listed with the National Register of Historic Places and are now cruising in Washington state after restorations.\n\nIn the Inland Brown Water Trade another type of pilots are known as trip pilots. Due to the shortage of qualified posted masters these independent contractors fill the holes in the manning schedule on inland push boats on various inland river routes.\n\nTheir size and mass makes large ships very difficult to manoeuvre; the stopping distance of a supertanker is typically measured in miles/kilometers and even a slight error in judgment can cause millions of dollars in damage. For this reason, many years of experience in an operating area are required to qualify as a pilot. For example, the California Board of Pilot Commissioners requires that pilot trainees must have a master's license, two years command experience on tugs or deep draft vessels, and pass a written exam and simulator exercise, followed by a period of up to three years training gaining experience with all types of vessel and docking facilities. Following licensing, pilots are required to engage in extensive continuing educational programs.\n\nBy far the most challenging part of any ship's voyage is the passage through the narrow waterways that lead to port and the final docking of the ship. The pilot brings to the ship expertise in handling large vessels in confined waterways and expert local knowledge of the port. In addition to bringing local maritime expertise on board, unlike the vessel's captain the pilot is insulated from the economic pressures (e.g., getting the ship from point A to point B on time, regardless of weather conditions, traffic, or other navigation issues) that can compromise safety. Instead of being part of the ship's crew, pilots are employed locally and therefore act on behalf of the public rather than of the shipowners. \nNormally, the pilot joins an incoming ship prior to the ship's entry into the shallow water at the designated \"Pilot boarding area\" via helicopter or pilot boat and climbs a pilot ladder sometimes up to 40 feet (~12 metres) to the deck of the largest container and tanker ships. Climbing the pilot ladder can be dangerous, even more so in rough seas considering that both the ship to be piloted and the pilot's own vessel are usually both moving. With outgoing vessels, a pilot boat returns the pilot to land after the ship has successfully negotiated coastal waters.\n\nPilots specifically use pilotage techniques relying on nearby visual reference points and local knowledge of tides, swells, currents, depths and shoals that might not be readily identifiable on nautical charts without first hand experience in the waters in question.\n\nBeyond the experience and training of regular ships' captains, pilots also receive special, ongoing training to stay on top of their profession. Pilots are required by law in most major sea ports of the world for large ships..\nIn every case, during the time passed aboard for operation, the pilot will remain under the Master's authority, and always out of \"ship's command chain\". The pilot remains aboard as an important and indispensable -Consultant of the Master-.\n\nHowever, in some countries, Masters (and sometimes other ranks too) of ships that call at only a few ports and so have strong local knowledge and experience of navigating in those ports, such as a ferry, may be issued with a pilotage exemption certificate, which relieves them of the need to take a pilot on board.\n\nBecause maritime pilots have advanced to the top of the maritime profession and are responsible for the most dangerous part of a voyage, they are generally well compensated.\nThe Florida Alliance of Maritime Organizations reported that Florida pilots salaries range from US$100,000 to US$400,000 annually. This was similar to other US states with large ports. Columbia River bar pilots earn about US$180,000 per year. A 2008 review of pilot salary in the United States showed that pay ranged from about US$250,000 to over US$500,000 per year.\nPilot compensation has been controversial in many ports, including Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, especially regarding pilots who are employed by public agencies instead of acting as independent contractors.\nCompensation varies in other nations. In New Zealand, according to the government career service, pilots earn NZ$90,000-120,000.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Historically, a \"masterpiece\" was a work of a very high standard produced to obtain membership of a guild or academy in various areas of the visual arts and crafts.\nThe form \"masterstik\" is recorded in English or Scots in a set of Aberdeen guild regulations dated to 1579, whereas \"masterpiece\" is first found in 1605, already outside a guild context, in a Ben Jonson play. \"Masterprize\" was another early variant in English.\n\nIn English, the term rapidly became used in a variety of contexts for an exceptionally good piece of creative work, and was \"in early use, often applied to man as the 'masterpiece' of God or Nature\".\n\nOriginally, the term \"masterpiece\" referred to a piece of work produced by an apprentice or journeyman aspiring to become a master craftsman in the old European guild system. His fitness to qualify for guild membership was judged partly by the masterpiece, and if he was successful, the piece was retained by the guild. Great care was therefore taken to produce a fine piece in whatever the craft was, whether confectionery, painting, goldsmithing, knifemaking, or many other trades.\n\nIn England, in the 17th century, the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, for instance, required an apprentice to produce a masterpiece under their supervision at a \"workhouse\" in Goldsmiths' Hall. The workhouse had been set up as part of a tightening of standards after the company became concerned that the level of skill of goldsmithing was being diluted. The wardens of the company had complained in 1607 that the \"true practise of the Art & Mystery of Goldsmithry is not only grown into great decays but also dispersed into many parts, so as now very few workmen are able to finish & perfect a piece of plate singularly with all the garnishings & parts thereof without the help of many & several hands...\". The same goldsmithing organization still requires the production of a masterpiece but it is no longer produced under supervision.\n\nIn Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, apprentices who wished to become master goldsmith were required to produce columbine cups, dice for a steel seal, and gold rings set with precious stones before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths' guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves. In some guilds, apprentices were not allowed to marry until they had obtained full membership.\n\nThe practice of producing a masterpiece has continued in some modern academies of art, where the general term for such works is now reception piece. The Royal Academy in London uses the term \"diploma work\" and it has acquired a fine collection of diploma works received as a condition of membership.\n\n\n"}

Since the beginning of 2010, the Carnegie Mellon research team has been running NELL around the clock, sifting through hundreds of millions of web pages looking for connections between the information it already knows and what it finds through its search process – to make new connections in a manner that is intended to mimic the way humans learn new information. For example, in encountering the word pair \"Pikes Peak\", NELL would notice that both words are capitalized and deduce from the second word that it was the name of a mountain, and then build on the relationship of words surrounding those two words to deduce other connections.\n\nThe goal of NELL and other semantic learning systems, such as IBM's Watson system, is to be able to develop means of answering questions posed by users in natural language with no human intervention in the process. Oren Etzioni of the University of Washington lauded the system's \"continuous learning, as if NELL is exercising curiosity on its own, with little human help\".\n\nBy October 2010, NELL has doubled the number of relationships it has available in its knowledge base and has learned 440,000 new facts, with an accuracy of 87%. Team leader Tom M. Mitchell, chairman of the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon described how NELL \"self-corrects when it has more information, as it learns more\", though it does sometimes arrive at incorrect conclusions. Accumulated errors, such as the deduction that Internet cookies were a kind of baked good, led NELL to deduce from the phrases \"I deleted my Internet cookies\" and \"I deleted my files\" that \"computer files\" also belonged in the baked goods category. Clear errors like these are corrected every few weeks by the members of the research team and the system is allowed to continue its learning process.\n\n\n"}

Many of them were borrowed via Czech, which, too, influenced Polish in that era (hence e.g. \"wiesioły\" \"happy, blithe\" (cf. \"wiesiołek\") morphed into modern Polish \"wesoły\", with the original vowels and the consonants of Czech \"veselý\"). Also, in later centuries, with the onset of cities founded on German law (namely, the so-called Magdeburg law), Middle High German urban and legal words filtered into Old Polish. Around the 14th or 15th centuries the aorist and imperfect became obsolete. In the 15th century the dual fell into disuse except for a few fixed expressions (adages, sayings). In relation to most other European languages, though, the differences between Old and Modern Polish are comparatively slight; the Polish language is somewhat conservative relative to other Slavic languages.\n\nThe difficulty the medieval scribes had to face was attempting to codify the language was the inadequacy of the Latin alphabet to some sounds of the Polish language, for example \"cz, sz\". Thus, Old Polish does not have a standard spelling. One letter could give several sounds - e.g. s can be read as \"s\", \"sz\" or \"ś\". Writing words was almost entirely consistent with the spelling of Latin, for example. Bichek - Byczek, Gneuos - Gniewosz etc.\n\nThe Book of Henryków (, ), contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language: \"Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\" (pronounced originally as: \"Daj, uć ja pobrusza, a ti pocziwaj,\" modern Polish: \"Daj, niech ja pomielę, a ty odpoczywaj\" or \"Pozwól, że ja będę mełł, a ty odpocznij\", English: \"Come, let me grind, and you take a rest\"), written around 1270.\n\nThe medieval recorder of this phrase, the Cistercian monk Peter of the Henryków monastery, noted that \"Hoc est in polonico\" (\"This is in Polish\").\n\nAbout 1440 , a professor of Jagiellonian University, tried to codify the Polish alphabet. He wrote the first tract on Polish orthographic rules (in Latin) and rhyme \"Obiecado\" (in Polish). The reform consisted in the introduction of round and unrounded letters on the distinction between hard and soft consonants. It also contained merging double vowels to a long vowel, for example: \"aa\" – /aː/. Parkoszowic's proposal was not adopted, and his theoretical concepts had no followers.\n\nOver the centuries Old Polish pronunciation was subjected to numerous modifications. These are only the most basic ones.\n\nThe consonant system transferred into the soft coronal consonants, for example for . Many consonant clusters were simplified; which in the process made assimilation reverse many consonants in words, before that following a voiceless consonant.\n\n\n"}

Interpretation of what defines organic minutes may vary among telecommunications relay service providers especially trying to benefit from ramping up unnecessary minutes for the sole purpose of making profit.\n\nIn 2009 Tom Chandler, chief of the FCC Disability Rights Office, expressed concerns about relay companies abusing their privileges to the TRS fund. He mentioned in his internal email distributions that the programs offered through the video relay service was a \"classic fleecing of America.\" The government, he said, was reimbursing companies for it at \"ridiculously high rates.\" \n\nVideo Relay Service companies, especially with venture capitalists behind the service, view this business opportunity as a quick way of making lucrative profits for their \"good will\". Companies are becoming \"creative\" with how to ramp up minutes since every minute is compensated by the FCC.\n\nRelay companies would purposefully contract a telemarketing firm and create \"job opportunities\" for the deaf and hard of hearing by opening up positions. The deaf and hard of hearing staff under a telemarketing firm would call through the contracted relay provider thus generate minutes. In return, the telemarketing firm would appreciate a percentage of the profit from the TRS fund.\n\nAnother strategy by relay companies to create \"job opportunities\" would involve hiring anybody who knows sign language to engage in conference calls during the day on a daily basis. Whatever their job titles are, they are encouraged to call internally to a conference call bridge through their own Video Relay Service interpreter to communicate with each other.\n\nSimilar to the conference call strategy, the relay company would promote \"educational seminars\" for the deaf and hard of hearing over the phone via a conference call bridge. Each seminars usually last 60 minutes long. A large number of deaf and hard of hearing individuals are invited and they call the relay provider, who is promoting the tele-seminar.\n\nThe tele-seminars are provided at no cost to provide incentives for the deaf and hard of hearing to lure them into making an \"educational\" call. The minutes used through the tele-seminars are compensated along with lucrative profits.\n\nRelay providers are not giving enough \"job opportunities\" for the deaf and hard of hearing in the Customer Service department. The reason is that the relay provider would prefer to place a hearing representative who will use the relay service to communicate to the deaf customers. This may be argued that it is in fact organic minutes; however, this is an example of \"manufacturing minutes\". The deaf and hard of hearing population would rather speak directly to another deaf and hard of hearing individual in their naive language.\n\nThe original purpose of TRS is simply provide a two-way communication between deaf, hard of hearing, and speech-disabled individuals to leverage a functional equivalence experience. The service is not intended for any companies to make lucrative profits out of the TRS fund that are not true to the spirit of relay service. \n\nAccording to the TRS Rules; § 64.601 Definitions and provisions of general applicability; Section (15) it is noted that \"..services that enable two-way communication between an individual who uses a text telephone or other nonvoice terminal device and an individual who does not use such a device, speech-to-speech services, video relay services and non-English relay services\". The underlying concept of TRS is to provide a true telephone conversation between the caller and called parties (deaf/hoh/speech-disabled and hearing persons).\n"}

{"id": "41714754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41714754", "title": "Queering", "text": "Queering\n\nQueering is the verb form of the word queer and comes from the shortened version of the phrase queer reading. It is a technique that came out of queer theory in the late 1980s through the 1990s and is used as a way to challenge heteronormativity by analyzing places in a text that utilize heterosexuality or identity binaries. Queering is a method that can be applied to literature as well as film to look for places where things such as gender, sexuality, masculinity, and femininity can be challenged and questioned. Originally the method of queering dealt more strictly with gender and sexuality, but quickly expanded to become more of an umbrella term for addressing identity as well as a range of systems of oppression and identity politics. Even the term queer itself can be queered, because much of queer theory involves working to fight against normalization even in the field itself. In the context of queer theory, \"queering is something we do, rather than something we are (or are not).\" \n\nAn example of \"queering\" would be to reexamine the primary sources from the life of King Richard I of England, to search for evidence that he exhibited homosexual behavior or attitudes. Queering, as a tool of historical analysis, does not necessarily mean an attempt to determine if historical figure actually engaged in homosexual behaviors. It embraces a more fluid spectrum of gender attitudes which may have been entirely emotional, i.e. if celibate monks who wrote letters of intimate affection could be said to be exhibiting a form of romantic love, even if they never engaged in intimate physical behavior, or even consciously considered their behavior to be a parallel of romantic physical relationships.\n\nQueering has drawn some criticism from contemporary scholarship for projecting modern biases backwards onto historical figures (presentism), or seeing only what researchers want to see. Conversely, other scholarship has argued that it is a useful tool for challenging previously held assumptions that the concepts of gender behavior held by peoples in different historical eras were exactly like modern conceptions. To turn to the example of Richard the Lionheart, early 20th century scholarship barely questioned that he might have taken part in homosexual behavior. At the other extreme, later scholarship reexamined the evidence and concluded that he was a \"homosexual\" in the modern sense. These two extremes were debated and refined, with a general consensus emerging that Richard probably engaged in sexual activity with both men and women at different times in his life, but that Richard's self-conception wasn't necessarily an exact equivalent to the modern sense of homosexual identity.\n\nHistorically queer was a word that referred to something as odd or strange. As the verb form of queer, queering can refer to the act of taking something and looking at it through a lens that makes it strange or troubles it in some way. By the 1940s (in the United States), \"queer\" came to be used in reference to sexuality that deviated from heterosexual norms. It was in the period of the late 80’s and early 90’s when LGBT AIDS activist groups, such as Act Up and Queer Nation, began to reclaim the term queer as a positive identifier and as a process of questioning mainstream ideas about what was considered normal. Cathy Cohen argues that groups like these also extended the use of queer to move past “assimilationist tendencies\" present in AIDS activism. This is based on sentiments expressed by groups like Queer Nation who felt that queer as a word and a sentiment was too focused on of non-normative sexualities and identities. Within such groups, queer as a noun was reclaimed again to mean something radical. Queering then became a tool for social and political subversion of dominant culture. Because it is rooted in queer theory, it is also closely tied into queer politics and queer activism.\n\nBecause the idea of queering comes from the term queer, it has a wide variety of definitions as well as uses. For example, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, a foundational theorist of queer theory says that queer can mean \"the open mesh of possibilities, gaps…and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone’s gender, of anyone’s sexuality aren't made (or \"can't be\" made) to signify monolithically.\" Literary critic Michael Warner offers this definition: \"Queer gets a critical edge by defining itself against the normal rather than the heterosexual.\" Judith Butler, another theorist credited with the founding of queer theory, talks about queer as being an act that that can be performed. In a more current context, methods of queering extend beyond critiquing literature to examine topics from popular culture to more abstract topics like theology and time. In her essay about the benefits of queering theology, Thelathia \"Nikki\" Young, says that queering is a way to \"[deconstruct] the logics and frameworks operating within old and new theological and ethical concepts.\" In addition to these deconstructions, she argues that queering \"dismantles the dynamics of power and privilege persisting among diverse subjectivities.\"\n\nIn Pia Livia Hekanaho's essay \"Queering Catcher: Flits, Straights, and Other Morons,\" she uses queering to analyze “the leaking boundaries of 'straight' (heterosexual) masculinity and the queer identities that may lie beyond those boundaries” in J.D. Salinger’s 1951 novel \"Catcher in the Rye\". In it, she looks at how the narrator Holden Caufield is caught between the strictness of normative masculinity and a fear of non-normative sexualities and manhood. Judith Butler uses a queer reading of the 1929 novel \"Passing\" by Nella Larson to see the possibilities of blurring the binaries of both race and attraction.\n\nQueering also occurred in popular music in disco culture. Prior to the Stonewall Rebellions in New York that arguably mark the birth of disco, heterosexual norms dominated the club scene. It was only after disco music came out did queering begin to take its mark. This was seen especially on the dance floors at straight and gay clubs alike. Whereas before, the norm was for a man and a female to take the dance floor together, queering allowed for individuals to dance by themselves, or for same sex dance partners to take the floor.\n"}

Because the King never responded to the petition, Warren A. Perrin, a Cajun attorney and cultural activist from Erath, Louisiana, in the 1990s resurrected the petition and threatened to sue Elizabeth II (great-great-great-great-granddaughter of George III), as Queen in Right of the United Kingdom, if the British government refused to acknowledge the illegality of the Grand Dérangement.\n\nAfter 13 years of discussions, Perrin and his supporters in the United States and Canada persuaded the Government of Canada to issue a royal proclamation acknowledging the historical fact of the Great Upheaval and consequent suffering experienced by the Acadian people.

The film follows eight competitors in the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee. The film received positive reviews and won several awards. \n\nThe spellers were Neil Kadakia, Emily Stagg, Ashley White, April DeGideo, Harry Altman, Angela Arenivar, Nupur Lala and Ted Brigham. As they appear from left to right on the DVD's cover:\n\nNeil (as speller # 139) missed \"hellebore\" in the bee to get ninth place. Other words Neil spelled include: encephalon, desecration, mercenary, Darjeeling, and hypsometer. He was sponsored by the \"Orange County Register\". Neil is a graduate of UC Berkeley. Before he went to college, he went on a jet ski expedition with his father and his sister, Shivani, also a speller. He is currently the COO of Greens Global, a real estate company based out of San Clemente, CA. On July 3, 2011, he married Archana Sheth, also a UC Berkeley graduate. He is also an avid chess player, and has earned over 15 chess trophies in his life.\nHis grandfather paid 1000 people in India to pray for him.\n\nEmily Stagg (speller # 148) was sponsored by the \"New Haven Register\" in New Haven, Connecticut and spelled: seguidilla, disclaimant, kookaburra, viand, apocope, brunneous, clavecin (spelled incorrectly as \"clavison\"). She came in 6th place. In 2006, as a junior in Carleton College, she wrote an op-ed article for the New York Times questioning the usefulness of the National Spelling Bee.\n\nAshley White (speller 149) represented \"The Washington Informer\" in Washington, DC in the spelling bee. Following Ashley's teenage pregnancy (she was 18), a marketing consultant who had seen the movie managed to rally support from other viewers of the documentary to help Ashley into Howard University. The proctor of the Washington Informer regional spelling bee featured in the film is Mac McGarry\n\nApril DeGideo, who lives in Ambler, Pennsylvania, participated in the 1998 and 1999 bees, in the latter of which she placed third, representing the \"Times Herald\" of Norristown, Pennsylvania. April graduated in 2007 from New York University with a degree in Journalism. She then went on to get a second degree in creative writing and later went on to publish two books. \"The study guide\", and \"Where to start’’.\n\nMany critics who reviewed \"Spellbound\" singled out Altman (speller # 8) as its most interesting \"character\". Yet in the finals Altman is stumped by the word 'banns'. Roger Ebert wrote that he \"has so many eccentricities that he'd be comic relief in a teenage comedy... He screws his face up into so many shapes while trying to spell a word that it's a wonder the letters can find their way to the surface.\" He went to the Academy for Engineering and Design Technology in Hackensack, New Jersey. In autumn 2005, he enrolled in the University of Chicago. In 2014 Harry completed a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Michigan, focusing on integer complexity.\n\nAngela Arenivar represented the \"Amarillo Globe-News\" in the 1998 and 1999 bees. Angela graduated from Texas A&M University in 2007 with a bachelor's degree in Spanish and earned a master's in Spanish from the University of New Mexico in 2009. She has taught Spanish in Texas public high schools. Angela now attends Texas A&M University pursuing her Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies.\n\nNupur Lala was the champion of the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee (as speller # 155), spelling \"logorrhea\" to win. Nupur won the bee against David Lewandowski, a speller from Indiana who misspelled \"opsimath.\" She turned down an MTV reality show that would have followed her college years. In 2003, she entered University of Michigan at Ann Arbor to study brain and cognitive sciences and pre-medical studies and graduated in 2007 with a degree in Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science. In the fall of 2014 she entered the College of Medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.\n\nTed Brigham was speller # 1. He represented the \"Rolla Daily Record\" of Rolla, Missouri. One of the more notable stories from his experience is the congratulations posted by students on the marquee in front of his high school in which \"champ\" was misspelled (presumably as an ironic joke) as \"chapm\". Ted attended medical school in Kansas City, Missouri until his mysterious death in December 2007. His family chose not to disclose the circumstances of his death.\n\n\n\n\"Spellbound\" opened to positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 98%, based on reviews from 137 critics. Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 80% based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nThe film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature; Yana Gorskaya's editing won the ACE Eddie award for best editing of documentary. \"Spellbound\" won the Emmy Award for Cultural/Artistic Programming and Jeffrey Blitz was nominated for directing. \n\nIn 2007, it was included as #4 of the \"IDA's Top 25 Documentaries\" of all-time by the members of the International Documentary Association.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "324276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324276", "title": "Stagecraft", "text": "Stagecraft\n\nStagecraft is the technical aspect of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes constructing and rigging scenery; hanging and focusing of lighting; design and procurement of costumes; make-up; stage management; audio engineering; and procurement of props. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it is primarily the practical implementation of a scenic designer's artistic vision.\n\nIn its most basic form, stagecraft may be executed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. Regional theatres and larger community theatres will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.\nWithin significantly larger productions, for example a modern Broadway show, effectively bringing a show to opening night requires the work of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. Modern stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition.\n\nGreeks were the earliest recorded practitioners of stagecraft. \"Skene\" is Greek, translating roughly into \"scene\" or \"scenery\", and refers to a large scenic house, about one story tall, with three doors. On the audience-side of the Skene, what are now known as \"flats\" could be hung. Flats developed to two-sided painted flats which would be mounted, centered, on a rotating pin, with rope running around each consecutive pin, so the flats could be turned for a scene-change. The double-sided-flat eventually evolved into the periaktos (pl. periaktoi).\n\nAs well as flats, the Greeks also used such machines as the \"ekkyklema\", essentially a platform on wheels, and the deus ex machina, a hand-cranked lift to be used to lift a character/scenery over the skene. Over 20 such scenic inventions can be traced back to the Greeks. No light but that of the sun was used; plays started at sun-rise and continued until sun-down.\n\nPlays of Medieval times were held in different places such as the streets of towns and cities, performed by traveling, secular troupes. Some were also held in monasteries, performed by church-controlled groups, often portraying religious scenes. The playing place could represent many different things such as indoors or outdoors (plain-an-gwarry (theatre)). They were played in certain places so the props could be used for the play. Songs and spectacles were often used in plays to enhance participation.\n\nMore modern stagecraft was in developed in England between 1576–1642. There were three different types of theaters in London – public, private and court. The size and shape varied but many were suggested to be round theaters. Public playhouses such as the Globe Theatre used rigging housed in a room on the roof to lower and raise in scenery or actors, and utilized the raised stage by developing the practice of using trap-doors in theatrical productions. Most of the theatres had circular-design, with an open area above the pit to allow sunlight to enter and light the stage. It was a penny admission to stand in the pit. Prices increase for seating. Court plays were used for holidays and special occasions.\n\nProscenium stages, or picture-box stages, were constructed in France around the time of the English Restoration, and maintain the place of the most popular form of stage in use to-date, and originally combined elements of the skene in design, essentially building a skene on-stage. Lighting of the period would have consisted of candles, used as foot-lights, and hanging from chandeliers above the stage.\n\nStagecraft during the Victorian era in England developed rapidly with the emergence of the West End. Prompted by and influx of urbanites in the greater London area, Parliament was forced to do away with previous licensing laws and allowed all theatres to perform straight plays in 1843. Electric lighting and hydraulics were introduced to draw large audiences to see on-stage storms, explosions, and miraculous transformations. Technologies developed during the latter part of the 19th-century paved the way for the development of special effects to be used in film.\n\nLighting continued to develop. In England, a form lamp using a blowpipe to heat lime to incandescence was developed, for navigation purposes – it was soon adapted to theatrical performances and the limelight became a widespread form of artificial light for theatres. To control the focus of the light, a Fresnel lens was used.\n\nOriginally intended to replace large, convex lenses in lighthouses, Dr. Fresnel sectioned out the convex lens in a series of circles, like tree-rings, and keeping the angle of the specific section, moved the section much closer to the flat side of the convex lens.\n\nAfter candles, came gas lighting, utilizing pipes with small openings which were lit before every performance, and could be dimmed by controlling the flow of gas, so long as the flame never went out. With the turn of the 20th century, many theatre companies making the transition from gas to electricity would install the new system right next to the old one, resulting in many explosions and fires due to the electricity igniting the gas lines.\n\nModern theatrical lighting is electrically-based. Many lamps and lighting instruments are in use today, and the field is rapidly becoming one of the most diverse and complex in the industry.\n\nStagecraft comprises many disciplines, typically divided into a number of main disciplines:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61117", "title": "Taboo", "text": "Taboo\n\nIn any given society, a taboo is an implicit prohibition on something (usually against an utterance or behavior) based on a cultural sense that it is excessively repulsive or, perhaps, too sacred for ordinary people. Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies. On a comparative basis taboos, for example related to food items, seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group by custom or religion may be perfectly acceptable to another.\n\nWhether scientifically correct or not, taboos are often meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Taboos can help utilize a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress a subsection of the community. A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of \"belonging\".\n\nThe meaning of the word \"taboo\" has been somewhat expanded in the social sciences to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on moral judgment, religious beliefs, or cultural norms. \"Breaking a taboo\" is usually considered objectionable by society in general, not merely a subset of a culture.\n\nThe term \"taboo\" comes from the Tongan \"tapu\" or Fijian \"tabu\" (\"prohibited\", \"disallowed\", \"forbidden\"), related among others to the Maori \"tapu\", Hawaiian \"kapu\", and Malagasy \"fady\". Its English use dates to 1777 when the British explorer James Cook visited Tonga, and referred to the Tongans' use of the term \"taboo\" for \"any thing is forbidden to be eaten, or made use of\". He wrote:\nThe term was translated to him as \"consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed.\" \"Tabu\" itself has been derived from alleged Tongan morphemes \"ta\" (\"mark\") and \"bu\" (\"especially\"), but this may be a folk etymology (Tongan does not actually have a phoneme /b/), and \"tapu\" is usually treated as a unitary, non-compound word inherited from Proto-Polynesian *\"tapu\", in turn inherited from Proto-Oceanic *\"tabu\", with the reconstructed meaning \"sacred, forbidden.\" In its current use on Tonga, the word \"tapu\" means \"sacred\" or \"holy\", often in the sense of being restricted or protected by custom or law. On the main island, the word is often appended to the end of \"Tonga\" as \"Tongatapu\", here meaning \"Sacred South\" rather than \"Forbidden South\".\n\nSigmund Freud speculated that incest and patricide were the only two universal taboos and formed the basis of civilization. However, although cannibalism, in-group murder, and incest are taboo in the majority of societies, exceptions can be found, such as marriages between brothers and sisters in Roman Egypt. Modern Western societies, however, do not condone such relationships. These familial sexual activities are criminalised, even if all parties are consenting adults. Through an analysis of the language surrounding these laws, it can be seen how the policy makers, and society as a whole, find these acts to be immoral.\n\nCommon taboos involve restrictions or ritual regulation of killing and hunting; sex and sexual relationships; reproduction; the dead and their graves; as well as food and dining (primarily cannibalism and dietary laws such as vegetarianism, \"kashrut\", and \"halal\") or religious (treif and haram). In Madagascar, a strong code of taboos, known as \"fady\", constantly change and are formed from new experiences. Each region, village or tribe may have its own \"fady\".\n\nThe word \"taboo\" gained popularity at times, with some scholars looking for ways to apply it where other English words had previously been applied. For example, J. M. Powis Smith, in his book \"The American Bible\" (editor's preface 1927), used \"taboo\" occasionally in relation to Israel's Tabernacle and ceremonial laws, including , ; ; , , and .\n\nAlbert Schweitzer wrote a chapter about taboos of the people of Gabon. As an example, it was considered a misfortune for twins to be born, and they would be subject to many rules not incumbent on other people.\n\nCommunist and materialist theorists have argued that taboos can be used to reveal the histories of societies when other records are lacking. Marvin Harris particularly endeavored to explain taboos as a consequence of ecologic and economic conditions.\n\nSome argue that contemporary multicultural societies have taboos against tribalisms (for example, ethnocentrism and nationalism) and prejudices (racism, sexism, religious extremism).\n\nChanging social customs and standards also create new taboos, such as bans on slavery; extension of the pedophilia taboo to ephebophilia; prohibitions on alcohol, tobacco, or psychopharmaceutical consumption (particularly among pregnant women); and the employment of politically correct euphemismsat times quite unsuccessfullyto mitigate various alleged forms of discrimination.\n\nIncest itself has been pulled both ways, with some seeking to normalize consensual adult relationships regardless of the degree of kinship (notably in Europe) and others expanding the degrees of prohibited contact (notably in the United States.)\n\nIn medicine, professionals who practice in ethical and moral grey areas, or fields subject to social stigma such as late termination of pregnancy, may refrain from public discussion of their practice. Among other reasons, this taboo may come from concern that comments may be taken out of the appropriate context and used to make ill-informed policy decisions.\n\n"}

Thus, it posits Marcan priority and Matthaean posteriority.\n\nStorr, in his groundbreaking 1786 argument for Marcan priority, asked, if Mark was a source for Matthew and Luke, how the latter two were then related. Storr proposed, among other possibilities, that canonical Greek Matthew was adapted from an earlier Aramaic Matthew (the \"logia\" spoken of by Papias) by following Mark primarily but also drawing from Luke, although he later went on to oppose this.\n\nThese ideas were little noticed until 1838, when C. G. Wilke revived the hypothesis of Marcan priority and extensively developed the argument for Matthaean posteriority. Wilke's contemporary Weisse at the same time independently argued for Marcan priority but for Matthew and Luke independently using Mark and another source Q—the two-source hypothesis. A few other German scholars supported Wilke's hypothesis in the nineteenth century, but in time most came to accept the two-source hypothesis, which remains the dominant theory to this day. Wilke's hypothesis was accepted by Karl Kautsky in his \"Foundations of Christianity\".\n\nWilke's hypothesis received little further attention until recent decades, when it was revived in 1992 by Huggins, then Hengel, then independently by Blair.
