{"id": "1876919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1876919", "title": "Akkala Sami language", "text": "Akkala Sami language\n\nAkkala Sami is a Sami language that was spoken in the Sami villages of A´kkel (Russian \"Бабинский\", Finnish \"Akkala\"), Ču´kksuâl (Russian \"Экостровский\") and Sââ´rvesjäu´rr (Russian \"Гирвасозеро\", Finnish \"Hirvasjärvi\"), in the inland parts of the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Formerly erroneously regarded as a dialect of Kildin Sami, it has recently become recognized as an independent Sami language that is most closely related to its western neighbor Skolt Sami.\n\nAkkala Sami is the most endangered eastern Sami language. On December 29, 2003, Maria Sergina – one of the last fluent native speakers of Akkala Sami – died. However, as of 2011 there were at least two people, both aged 70, with some knowledge of Akkala Sami. Remaining ethnic Akkala Samis live in the village Yona.\n\nAlthough there exist a description of Akkala Sami phonology and morphology, a few published texts, and archived audio recordings, the Akkala Sami language remains among the most poorly documented Sami languages. \n\nThe following overview is based on P. M. Zaykov's monograph. Zaykov's Uralic phonetic transcription is retained here. The middle dot ˑ denotes palatalization of the preceding consonant, analyzed by Zaykov as semisoft pronunciation.\n\nAkkala Sami has 8 cases, singular and plural: nominative, genitive-accusative, partitive, dative-illative, locative, essive, comitative and abessive. Case and number are expressed by a combination of endings and consonant gradation:\n\nThe table below gives the declension of the personal pronouns \"monn\" ‘I’ and \"mij\" ‘we’. The pronouns \"tonn\" ‘you (sg.)’ and \"sonn\" ‘(s)he’ are declined like \"monn\", the pronouns \"tij\" ‘you (pl.)’ and \"sij\" ‘they’ are declined like \"mij\".\n\nThe interrogative pronouns \"mī\" ‘what?’ and \"tˑī\", \"kī\" ‘who?’ are declined as follows:\n\nThe proximal demonstrative \"tˑa͕t\" ‘this’ and the medial demonstrative \"ti̮t\" ‘that’ are declined as follows:\n\nAkkala Sami verbs have three persons and two numbers, singular and plural. There are three moods: indicative, imperative and conditional; the potential mood has disappeared. Below, the paradigm of the verbs \"va͕n̄ˑće\" ‘to walk’ and \"korrɛ\" ‘to knit’ is given in the present and imperfect tense:\n\nThe verb \"ĺiije\" ‘to be’ conjugates as follows:\n\nCompound tenses such as perfect and pluperfect are formed with the verb \"ĺii̭je\" in the present or imperfect as auxiliary, and the participle of the main verb. Examples are \"ĺam tĭĕhtmi̮nč\" ‘I have known’ from \"tĭĕhttɛ\" ‘to know’, and \"ĺai tui̭jāma\" ‘(s)he had made’ from \"tui̭je\" ‘to make’.\n\nThe conditional mood has the marker \"-č\", which is added to the weak grade of the stem: \"kuarčim\" ‘I would sew’, \"vizzčik\" ‘you (sg.) would become tired’.\n\nAs in other Sami languages, Akkala Sami makes use of a negative verb that conjugates according to person and number, while the main verb remains unchanged. The conjugation of the negative verb is shown here together with the verb \"aĺ̄ḱe\" ‘to begin’:\n\nThe third person singular and plural of the verb \"ĺii̭je\" ‘to be’ have special contracted forms \"ɛĺĺa\" and \"jāĺa\".\n"}

Many roads in benaulim are named with his name after his death\n\nRodrigues produced short stories for the \"Renascença\" programme of All-India Radio, which were later collected and published in a collection entitled \"Contos Regionais\", or \"Regional Stories\", in 1987. Given that this title was also used by the Goan short-story writer José da Silva Coelho, whose work was rediscovered by Devi and Seabra, there is a possibility that Rodrigues was giving a sly wink back to his predecessor. Two of his stories have been translated into English: \"O Capitão Tarimbeiro\" (as \"Risen from the Ranks\") and \"O Herdeiro dos Cabrais\" (as \"The Scion of the Cabral Family\").\n\nMany of Rodrigues's stories are historical, ranging from the eighteenth century right up until his present day. Focussing on Goa's Catholic community, his stories often revolve around issues of decline and recovery. The Goan critic Bailon de Sá described his collection as showing a sort of \"inside out exoticism\".\n"}

{"id": "3492955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3492955", "title": "Fiber to the x", "text": "Fiber to the x\n\nFiber to the \"x (FTTX) (also spelled Fibre to the \"x) or fiber in the loop is a generic term for any broadband network architecture using optical fiber to provide all or part of the local loop used for last mile telecommunications. As fiber optic cables are able to carry much more data than copper cables, especially over long distances, copper telephone networks built in the 20th century are being replaced by fiber.\n\nFTTX is a generalization for several configurations of fiber deployment, arranged into two groups: FTTP/FTTH/FTTB (Fiber laid all the way to the premises/home/building) and FTTC/N (fiber laid to the cabinet/node, with copper wires completing the connection).\n\nResidential areas already served by balanced pair distribution plant call for a trade-off between cost and capacity. The closer the fiber head, the higher the cost of construction and the higher the channel capacity. In places not served by metallic facilities, little cost is saved by not running fiber to the home.\n\nFiber to the x is the key method used to drive next-generation access (NGA), which describes a significant upgrade to the Broadband available by making a step change in speed and quality of the service. This is typically thought of as asymmetrical with a download speed of 24 Mbit/s plus and a fast upload speed. The Definition of UK Superfast Next Generation Broadband\nOFCOM have defined NGA as in \"Ofcom's March 2010 'Review of the wholesale local access market\" \n\"Super-fast broadband is generally taken to mean broadband products that provide a maximum download speed that is greater than 24 Mbit/s. This threshold is commonly considered to be the maximum speed that can be supported on current generation (copper-based) networks.\"\n\nA similar network called a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) network is used by cable television operators but is usually not synonymous with \"fiber In the loop\", although similar advanced services are provided by the HFC networks. Fixed wireless and mobile wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) are an alternative for providing Internet access.\n\nThe telecommunications industry differentiates between several distinct FTTX configurations. The terms in most widespread use today are:\n\nTo promote consistency, especially when comparing FTTH penetration rates between countries, the three FTTH Councils of Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific agreed upon definitions for FTTH and FTTB in 2006, with an update in 2009, 2011 and another in 2015. The FTTH Councils do not have formal definitions for FTTC and FTTN.\n\nWhile fiber optic cables can carry data at high speeds over long distances, copper cables used in traditional telephone lines and ADSL cannot. For example, the common form of Gigabit Ethernet (1Gbit/s) runs over relatively economical category 5e, category 6 or augmented category 6 unshielded twisted-pair copper cabling but only to . However, 1 Gbit/s Ethernet over fiber can easily reach tens of kilometers. Therefore, FTTP has been selected by every major communications provider in the world to carry data over long 1 Gbit/s symmetrical connections directly to consumer homes. FTTP configurations that bring fiber directly into the building can offer the highest speeds since the remaining segments can use standard Ethernet or coaxial cable.\n\nFiber is often said to be \"future-proof\" because the data rate of the connection is usually limited by the terminal equipment rather than the fiber, permitting substantial speed improvements by equipment upgrades before the fiber itself must be upgraded. Still, the type and length of employed fibers chosen, e.g. multimode vs. single-mode, are critical for applicability for future connections of over 1 Gbit/s. \n\nWith the rising popularity of high-definition, on-demand video streaming applications and devices such as YouTube, Netflix, Roku, and Facebook LIVE, the demand for reliable bandwidth is crucial as more and more people begin to utilize these services.\n\nFTTC (where fiber transitions to copper in a street cabinet) is generally too far from the users for standard ethernet configurations over existing copper cabling. They generally use very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) at downstream rates of 80 Mbit/s, but this falls extremely quickly over a distance of 100 meters.\n\nFiber to the premises (FTTP) is a form of fiber-optic communication delivery, in which an optical fiber is run in an optical distribution network from the central office all the way to the premises occupied by the subscriber. The term \"FTTP\" has become ambiguous and may also refer to FTTC where the fiber terminates at a utility pole without reaching the premises.\nFiber to the premises can be categorized according to where the optical fiber ends:\n\nAn apartment building may provide an example of the distinction between FTTH and FTTB. If a fiber is run to a panel inside each subscriber's apartment unit, it is FTTH. If instead, the fiber goes only as far as the apartment building's shared electrical room (either only to the ground floor or to each floor), it is FTTB.\n\nFiber to the curb/cabinet (FTTC) is a telecommunications system based on fiber-optic cables run to a platform that serves several customers. Each of these customers has a connection to this platform via coaxial cable or twisted pair. The \"curb\" is an abstraction and can just as easily mean a pole-mounted device or communications closet or shed. Typically any system terminating fiber within of the customer premises equipment would be described as FTTC.\n\nFiber to the node or neighborhood (FTTN), sometimes identified with and sometimes distinguished from fiber to the cabinet (FTTC), is a telecommunication architecture based on fiber-optic cables run to a cabinet serving a neighborhood. Customers typically connect to this cabinet using traditional coaxial cable or twisted pair wiring. The area served by the cabinet is usually less than one mile in radius and can contain several hundred customers. (If the cabinet serves an area of less than in radius, the architecture is typically called FTTC/FTTK.)\n\nFTTN allows delivery of broadband services such as high-speed internet. High-speed communications protocols such as broadband cable access (typically DOCSIS) or some form of digital subscriber line (DSL) are used between the cabinet and the customers. Data rates vary according to the exact protocol used and according to how close the customer is to the cabinet.\n\nUnlike FTTP, FTTN often uses existing coaxial or twisted-pair infrastructure to provide last mile service and is thus less costly to deploy. In the long term, however, its bandwidth potential is limited relative to implementations that bring the fiber still closer to the subscriber.\n\nA variant of this technique for cable television providers is used in a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) system. It is sometimes given the acronym FTTLA (fiber-to-the-last-amplifier) when it replaces analog amplifiers up to the last one before the customer (or neighborhood of customers).\n\nFTTC allows delivery of broadband services such as high-speed internet. Usually, existing wire is used with communications protocols such as broadband cable access (typically DOCSIS) or some form of DSL connecting the curb/cabinet and the customers. In these protocols, the data rates vary according to the exact protocol used and according to how close the customer is to the cabinet.\n\nWhere it is feasible to run new cable, both fiber and copper ethernet are capable of connecting the \"curb\" with a full 100Mbit/s or 1Gbit/s connection. Even using relatively cheap outdoor category 5 copper over thousands of feet, all ethernet protocols including power over Ethernet (PoE) are supported. Most fixed wireless technologies rely on PoE, including Motorola Canopy, which has low-power radios capable of running on a 12VDC power supply fed over several hundred feet of cable.\n\nPower line networking deployments also rely on FTTC. Using the IEEE P1901 protocol (or its predecessor HomePlug AV) existing electric service cables move up to 1Gbit/s from the curb/pole/cabinet into every AC electrical outlet in the home—coverage equivalent to a robust Wi-Fi implementation, with the added advantage of a single cable for power and data.\n\nBy avoiding new cable and its cost and liabilities, FTTC costs less to deploy. However, it also has historically had lower bandwidth potential than FTTP. In practice, the relative advantage of fiber depends on the bandwidth available for backhaul, usage-based billing restrictions that prevent full use of last-mile capabilities, and customer premises equipment and maintenance restrictions, and the cost of running fiber that can vary widely with geography and building type.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the largest deployment of FTTC was carried out by BellSouth Telecommunications. With the acquisition of BellSouth by AT&T, deployment of FTTC will end. Future deployments will be based on either FTTN or FTTP. Existing FTTC plant may be removed and replaced with FTTP. Verizon, meanwhile, announced in March 2010 they were winding down Verizon FiOS expansion, concentrating on completing their network in areas that already had FiOS franchises but were not deploying to new areas, suggesting that FTTH was uneconomic beyond these areas.\n\nVerizon also announced (at CES 2010) its entry into the smart home and power utility data management arenas, indicating it was considering using P1901-based FTTC or some other existing-wire approach to reach into homes, and access additional revenues from the secure AES-128 bandwidth required for advanced metering infrastructure. However, the largest 1Gbit/s deployment in the United States, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, despite being conducted by power utility EPB, was FTTH rather than FTTC, reaching every subscriber in a 600-square-mile area. Monthly pricing of $350 reflected this generally high cost of deployment. However, Chattanooga EPB has reduced the monthly pricing to $70/month.\n\nHistorically, both telephone and cable companies avoided hybrid networks using several different modes of transport from their point of presence into customer premises. The increased competitive cost pressure, availability of three different existing wire solutions, smart grid deployment requirements (as in Chattanooga), and better hybrid networking tools (with major vendors like Alcatel-Lucent and Qualcomm Atheros, and Wi-Fi solutions for edge networks, IEEE 1905 and IEEE 802.21 protocol efforts and SNMP improvements) all make FTTC deployments more likely in areas uneconomic to serve with FTTP/FTTH. In effect FTTC serves as a halfway measure between fixed wireless and FTTH, with special advantages for smart appliances and electric vehicles that rely on PLC use already.\n\nOperators around the world have been rolling out high-speed Internet access networks since the mid-2000s. Some used a network topology known as Active Ethernet Point-to-Point to deliver services from its central office directly into subscribers' homes. Fiber termination was handled by a residential gateway provided by Advanced Digital Broadcast inside a subscriber's home to be shared with other consumer electronics (CE) devices.\n\nSince 2007, Italian access providers Fastweb, Telecom Italia, Vodafone, and Wind participated in an initiative called Fiber for Italy, with the aim of creating a countrywide fiber-to-the-home network in Italy. The pilot taking place in the Italian capital, Rome, has seen symmetrical bandwidth of 100 Mbit/s. Telecom Italia, which refused to take part in the Fiber for Italy initiative, has an even more ambitious plan to bring fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-business to 138 cities by 2018.\n\nBy the end of December 2010, the total number of fiber-to-the-home enabled homes had passed 2.5 million, with more than 348,000 subscribers.)\n\nIn September 2010, the European Commission published a new \"Recommendation for Regulated Access to NGA Networks\" along with a list of measures to promote deployment of fast broadband and next generation access networks.\n\nPortugal Telecom plans to complete its fiber-to-the-home nationwide roll out by 2020. Currently 200 mbs down, 100mbs up costs 22 euros per month.\n\nGoogle Fiber provides speed of up to 1 Gbit/s.\n\nCopper telephone networks built in the 20th century are being replaced by FTTP in most countries.\n\nFTTN/C is seen as an interim step towards full FTTH and in many cases triple-play services delivered using this approach have been proven to grow subscriber numbers and ARPU considerably FTTN/C is currently used by a number of operators, including AT&T in the United States, Germany's Deutsche Telekom, Greece's OTE, Swisscom, TIM in Italy, Proximus in Belgium, nbn™ in Australia, and Canadian operators Telus, Cogeco and Bell Canada.\n\nThe simplest optical distribution network architecture is direct fiber: each fiber leaving the central office goes to exactly one customer. Such networks can provide excellent bandwidth but are more costly due to the fiber and central office machinery.\n\nSouth Africa and specifically in the city of Cape Town have one of the largest Direct fiber networks in the world. Cape Town has been on the forefront of telecommunication and connectivity for many years, with a large amount of fiber in the ground and many competitive offerings. Their argument for direct fiber is that multiple operators can patch into the network easily, and troubleshooting made simple.\n\nDirect fiber is generally favored by new entrants and competitive operators. A benefit is that no layer 2 networking technologies are excluded, whether passive optical network (PON), active optical network (AON), or other. Any form of regulatory remedy is possible using this topology.\n\nMore commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many customers. It is not until such a fiber gets relatively close to the customers that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers. AONs and PONs both achieve this split.\n\nAONs rely on electrically powered network equipment to distribute the signal, such as a switch or router. Normally, signals need an optical-electrical-optical transformation in the AON. Each signal leaving the central office is directed only to the customer for whom it is intended.\n\nIncoming signals from the customers avoid colliding at the intersection because the powered equipment there provides buffering. Active Ethernet (a type of ethernet in the first mile) is a common AON, which uses optical ethernet switches to distribute the signal, incorporating the customers' premises and the central office into a large switched ethernet network.\n\nSuch networks are identical to ethernet computer networks used in businesses and academic institutions, except that their purpose is to connect homes and buildings to a central office rather than to connect computers and printers within a location. Each switching cabinet can handle up to 1,000 customers, although 400–500 is more typical.\n\nThis neighborhood equipment performs layer 2 switching or layer 3 switching and routing, offloading full layer 3 routing to the carrier's central office. The IEEE 802.3ah standard enables service providers to deliver up to 100Mbit/s, full-duplex, over one single-mode optical fiber FTTP, depending on the provider. Speeds of 1Gbit/s are becoming commercially available.\n\nA passive optical network (PON) is a point-to-multipoint FTTP network architecture in which unpowered optical splitters are used to enable a single optical fiber to serve up to 128 customers. A PON reduces the fiber and central office equipment required compared with point-to-point architecture.\n\nThe downstream signal coming from the central office is broadcast to each customer premises sharing a fiber. Encryption is used to prevent eavesdropping. Upstream signals are combined using a multiple-access protocol, usually time division multiple access (TDMA).\n\nPoint-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a common way of delivering triple- and quad-play (voice, video, data, and mobile) services over both fiber and hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) networks. Active PPPoE uses dedicated fiber from an operator's central office all the way to the subscribers' homes, while hybrid networks (often FTTN) use it to transport data via fiber to an intermediate point to ensure sufficiently high throughput speeds over last mile copper connections.\n\nThis approach has become increasingly popular in recent years with telecoms service providers in both North America (AT&T, Telus, for example) and Europe's Fastweb, Telecom Italia, Telekom Austria and Deutsche Telekom, for example. Google has also looked into this approach, amongst others, as a way to deliver multiple services over open-access networks in the United States.\n\nOnce on private property, the signal is typically converted into an electrical format.\n\nThe optical network terminal (ONT, an ITU-T term) or unit (ONU, an identical IEEE term) converts the optical signal into an electrical signal using thin film filter technology. These units require electrical power for their operation, so some providers connect them to backup batteries in case of power outages to ensure emergency access to telecommunications. The optical line terminations \"range\" the optical network terminals or units in order to provide TDMA time slot assignments for upstream communication.\n\nFor FTTH and for some forms of FTTB, it is common for the building's existing ethernet, phone, and cable TV systems to connect directly to the optical network terminal or unit. If all three systems cannot directly reach the unit, it is possible to combine signals and transport them over a common medium such as Ethernet. Once closer to the end user, equipment such as a router or network interface controller can separate the signals and convert them into the appropriate protocol.\n\nFor FTTC and FTTN, the combined internet, video and telephone signal travels to the building over existing telephone or cable wiring until it reaches the end-user's living space, where a VDSL or DOCSIS modem converts data and video signals into ethernet protocol, which is sent over the end-user's category 5 cable.\n\n\n"}

It is attached either at the very top of the mast, or in fractional rigs between about 1/8 and 1/4 from the top of the mast. The other end of the forestay is attached to the bow of the boat.\n\nOften a sail is attached to the forestay. This sail may be a jib or a genoa. In a cutter rig, the jib or jibs are flown from stays in front of the forestay, perhaps going from the masthead to a bowsprit. The sail on the forestay is then referred to as the staysail or stays'l.\n\nA forestay might be made from stainless steel wire on a modern yacht, solid stainless steel rod, carbon rod, or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (such as Spectra or Dyneema) on a high-performance racing boat, and galvanised wire or natural fibers on an older cutter or square-rigged ship.\n\n"}

Cassidy (October 10, 1907 – June 14, 2000) was a Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and founder of the \"Dictionary of American Regional English\" (DARE) where he was also the chief editor from 1962 until his death. He was an advocate for the Jamaican language and a pioneer of autonomous orthographies for creole languages.\n\nBorn in Kingston, Jamaica on October 10, 1907. His father was Canadian and his mother was Jamaican. In 1918, aged 11, Cassidy moved with his family to Akron, Ohio where he graduated from high school. He enrolled in Ohio University later transferring to Oberlin College, where he graduated in 1930 and obtained a master's degree in 1932. By 1938, Cassidy had earned his doctoral degree at the University of Michigan, and had married Hélène Lucille Monod, a fellow student.\n\nIn 1939, Cassidy accepted a lectureship at the University of Wisconsin, and was made full professor in 1950. His first book, published in 1947, was entitled \"The Place Names of Dane County, Wisconsin.\" Cassidy then joined with Albert H. Marckwardt to produce the second edition of the \"Scribner Handbook of English,\" which was published in 1954.\n\nCassidy started as Chief Editor of the \"Dictionary of American Regional English\" in 1962, and saw Volume I (covering A-C) published by Harvard University Press in 1985. Volume II, in which Joan Houston Hall joined him, covered letters D-H and followed in 1991. They continued their collaboration with Volume III (I-O), published in 1996. Since Cassidy's death, Joan Houston Hall has carried on Cassidy's work as Chief Editor of what has come to be known as the \"DARE\" project. Volume IV, covering P-Sk, came out in 2002, and Volume V, covering Sl-Z,was published in 2012. Volume VI, subtitled \"Contrastive Maps, Index to Entry Labels, Questionnaire, and Fieldwork Data,\" was released in 2013. Joining Hall for that volume was Luanne von Schneidemesser who served as Senior Editor. Late that same year, the digital version was launched.\n\nIn 1951 a Fulbright Research Fellowship gave Cassidy the opportunity to travel to back his native Jamaica to research a Jamaican English and Jamaican creole dictionary. He used a tape recorder to document the language and may have been the first person to use the technology in the country. In 1961 he described the language of the people of Jamaica, what he called \"folk speech\", in a book titled \"Jamaica Talk.\" In 1967 he edited the \"Dictionary of Jamaican English,\" co-edited with Robert B. LePage, which drew from four centuries of written and oral usage.\n\nCassidy advocated for creole languages to use an orthography, or writing style, that did not rely on European spelling conventions.\n\nCassidy pioneered an orthography, initially proposed in 1961 and known as the Cassidy System, developed specifically for Jamaican that uses a phonemic system that closely reproduces the sound of the language. The Cassidy System was later adopted and modified by the Jamaican Language Unit (JLU) at University of the West Indies. In 2012 the Bible Society, in collaboration with JLU, translated the New Testament into Jamaican using the Cassidy orthography, it was published as \"Di Jamiekan Nyuu Testiment.\"\n\nHe was awarded three medals from the Institute of Jamaica; the Centenary Medal in 1979, the Silver Musgrave Medal in 1962 and the Gold Musgrave Medal in 1983.\n\nHe has hononary doctorates from the Memorial University of Newfoundland and the University of West Indies.\n\n"}

{"id": "1897176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897176", "title": "Hiking (sailing)", "text": "Hiking (sailing)\n\nIn sailing, hiking (stacking or stacking out in New Zealand; leaning out or sitting out in United Kingdom) is the action of moving the crew's body weight as far to windward (upwind) as possible, in order to decrease the extent the boat heels (leans away from the wind). By moving the crew's weight to windward, the moment of that force around the boat's center of buoyancy is increased. This opposes the heeling moment of the wind pushing sideways against the boat's sails. It is usually done by leaning over the edge of the boat as it heels. Some boats are fitted with equipment such as hiking straps (or toe straps) and trapezes to make hiking more effective.\n\nHiking is most integral to catamaran and dinghy sailing, where the lightweight boat can be easily capsized or turtled by the wind unless the sailor counteracts the wind's pressure by hiking, or eases the sails to reduce it. The heavy keel on larger keelboats means that it is rare to capsize them due to wind alone, but keelboat racers will still hike to prevent unnecessary heeling, or leaning sideways to leeward, because the more vertical in the water the keel is, the more effective it is at keeping the boat moving in a forward direction and preventing it from drifting to leeward, slowing the boat due to drag, and potentially increasing the distance the boat must sail when beating. Improper heel creates a tendency for the boat to turn off course, necessitating a correction with the rudder, which also increases drag. Sails use wind most efficiently when they are at a proper heel, another reason for controlling heel.\n\nMany boats, especially dinghies, have equipment that facilitates effective hiking. \"Hiking straps\" (toe straps) made from rope or webbing hold the sailor's feet down, allowing them to lean back over the gunwale of the boat while sitting facing in. These simple devices are almost universal on dinghies that do not have more complex hiking systems. Some sailors wear special shorts fitted with pads or stiff battens to help them hike more effectively and without tiring.\n\nSome dinghies and catamarans, such as the 505, 420, International 14, or Hobie 16, have a \"trapeze\" to allow the crew to increase their righting moment on the boat. These are wires attached high up on the mast, and fitted with a bracket that fits into a hook on a harness worn by the crew. This wire and harness then supports the crew as they stand and lean back over the water, pulling against the mast. On some boats, such as the Laser 2, the skipper uses hiking straps, and the crew uses a trapeze. On high-performance skiffs, such as the International 14 or 49er, both the skipper and the crew use trapezes.\n\n\"Hiking boards\" are long boards fitted perpendicular to the boat's hull, and sometimes stretching several feet over the water. These allow the crew to move their weight far out to windward. They are commonly designed to slide from side to side, so they are moved to the windward side whenever the boat tacks. They are most often used on sailing canoes, but can be installed on many kinds of dinghy. there are also two racing classes that use planks and they are the VJ, and the bigger Skate (dinghy).\n\nSome racing keelboats are fitted with elastic lifelines running down the sides of the boat. These allow the crew to lean into the lifeline to get further out on the windward rail. Many kinds of racing keelboat are raced with more crew aboard than is strictly necessary to operate the boat in order to increase the amount of weight on the upwind side of the boat, keeping the boat flatter.\n\nA few high performance keelboats, such as the Moore 30 and the Kiwi 35, have structural hiking \"wings\" built into their hull, which allows a lower displacement hull and increased leverage for hiking. See Turtling.\n\nOn most dinghies the tiller is fitted with a \"tiller extension\" or \"hiking stick\", which allows the skipper to steer the boat while hiked out.\n"}

{"id": "37631089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37631089", "title": "Journal therapy", "text": "Journal therapy\n\nJournal therapy is a writing therapy focusing on the writer's internal experiences, thoughts and feelings. This kind of therapy uses reflective writing enabling the writer to gain mental and emotional clarity, validate experiences and come to a deeper understanding of him/herself. Journal therapy can also be used to express difficult material or access previously inaccessible materials.\n\nLike other forms of therapy, journal therapy can be used to heal a writer's emotional or physical problems or work through a trauma, such as an illness, addiction, or relationship problems, among others. Journal therapy can supplement an on-going therapy, or can take place in group therapy or self-directed therapy.\nIra Progoff created journal writing in 1966 in New York. The intensive journal method is a structured way of writing about nature that allows the writer to achieve spiritual and personal growth. This method consists of a three-ring, loose-leaf binder with four color-coded sections: lifetime dimension, dialogue dimension, depth dimension and meaning dimension. These sections are divided into several subsections. Some of these subsections include topics like career, dreams, body and health, interests, events and meaning in life. Progoff created the intensive journal so that working in one part of the journal would in turn stimulate one to work on another part of the journal, leading to different viewpoints, awareness and connections between subjects. The intensive journal method began with recording the session in a daily log.\n\nThe field of journal therapy reached a wider audience in the 1970s with the publication of three books, namely, Progoff's \"At a Journal Workshop\" (1978), Christina Baldwin's \"One to One: Self-Understanding Through Journal Writing\" (1977) and Tristine Rainer's \"The New Diary\" (1978).\n\nIn 1985, psychotherapist and journal therapy pioneer, Kathleen Adams, started providing journal workshops, designed as a self-discovery process.\n\nIn the 1990s, James W. Pennebaker published multiple studies which affirmed that writing about emotional problems or traumas led to both physical and mental health benefits. These studies drew more attention to the benefits of writing as a therapy.\n\nIn the 2000s, journal therapy workshops were conducted at the Progoff's Dialogue House, Adams' Center for Journal Therapy and certificates were given through educational institutions. Generally, journal therapists obtain an advanced degree in psychology, counseling, social work, or another field and then enter a credentialing program or independent-study program.\n\nJournal therapy is a form of expressive therapy used to help writers better understand life's issues and how they can cope with these issues or fix them. The benefits of expressive writing include long-term health benefits such as better self-reported physical and emotional health, improved immune system, liver and lung functioning, improved memory, reduced blood pressure, fewer days in hospital, fewer stress-related doctor visits, improved mood and greater psychological well-being. Other therapeutic effects of journal therapy include the expression of feelings, which can lead to greater self-awareness and acceptance and can in turn allow the writer to create a relationship with his or herself. The short-term effects of expressive writing include increased distress and psychological arousal.\n\nMany psychotherapists incorporate journal \"homework\" in their therapy but few specialize in journal therapy. Journal therapy often begins with the client writing a paragraph or two at the beginning of a session. These paragraphs would reflect how the client is feeling or what is happening in his or her life and would set the direction of the session. Journal therapy then works to guide the client through different writing exercises. Subsequently, the therapist and the client then discuss the information revealed in the journal. In this method, the therapist often assigns journal \"homework\" that is to be completed by the next session. Journal therapy can also be provided to groups.\n\nJournal therapy consists of many techniques or writing exercises. In all journal therapy techniques, the writer is encouraged to date everything, write quickly, keep writings and always tell the complete truth. Some of the journal therapy techniques are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quiet and private environment must be created and provided throughout the entire journal writing process. This environment should contain features or elements that can make the writer feel good such as music, candles, a hot drink etc. This environment works to empower the writer and for him/her to associate good feelings with journal writing. To transition into writing, a journal writing session can be started with a drawing or sketch. After journal writing, something active should be done, such as running, walking, stretching, breathing etc. or something that is enjoyable like taking a bubble bath, baking cookies, listening to music, talking to someone, etc.\n\n"}

Kumaran Ashan (12 April 1873 – 16 January 1924), also known as \"Mahakavi Kumaran Ashan\" (the prefix Mahakavi, awarded by Madras University in 1922, means \"great poet\" and the suffix 'Aashaan means \"scholar\" or \"teacher\"), was one of the triumvirate poets of Kerala, South India. He was also a philosopher, a social reformer and a disciple of Sree Narayana Guru.\n\nKumaran Ashan initiated a revolution in Malayalam poetry in the first quarter of the 20th century, transforming it from the metaphysical to the lyrical. Deep moral and spiritual commitment is evident in Ashan's poetry. His works are an eloquent testimony of poetic concentration and dramatic contextualisation.\n\nAsan was born in a merchant family belonging to the Ezhava community in April 1873 in Kayikkara village, Chirayinkeezhu taluk, Anchuthengu Grama Panchaayath Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, south India. Named \"Kumaran\", he was the second son in a family of nine children. His father, \"Narayanan Perungudi\", was well versed in Malayalam and Tamil. His mother was Kaali. Asan inherited his taste for Kathakali and classical music. Kumaru trained in mathematics and Sanskrit for which he had a passion. Even though through his father's efforts, he got a job as a primary school teacher and an accountant to a wholesaler at the age of 14, he quit the job two years later to pursue higher studies in Sanskrit. He undertook a studentship in poetry under Manamboor Govindan Asan. He wished to learn Yoga and Tantra and worked as an apprentice in a Muruga temple at Vakkom. He composed a few devotional songs for the benefit of regular worshippers at this temple.\n\nIn 1917 Asan married Bhanumathiamma, the daughter of Thachakudy Kumaran – younger brother of Padmanabhan Palpu's father. . Bhanumathiamma, who was an active social worker, later remarried after Asan's death and died in 1975.\nKumaran became a disciple of Narayana Guru.\n\nSome of the earlier works of the poet were \"Subramanya Sathakam\" and \"Sankara Sathakam\", wherein Asan voiced his devotional aspirations. His short poem \"Veena Poovu\" (fallen flower) is a literary classic. It paved the way for a new movement in Malayalam literature. His elegy \"Prarodanam\" mourns the death of his contemporary and friend A. R. Raja Raja Varma, the famous grammarian. His \"Khanda Kavyas\" (poems) like \"Nalini\", \"Leela\", \"Karuna\" and \"Chandaalabhikshuki\" won critical acclaim as well as popularity. In \"Chintaavishtayaaya Seetha\" (The Contemplative Sita) he displays his poetic artistry, while in \"Duravastha\", he patiently and skilfully tears down the barriers created by feudalism, orthodoxy and casteism and consummates the dictum of the Guru, \"One Caste, One Religion, One God for man\".\n\nHe wrote the epic poem \"Buddha Charitha\" for which he got inspiration from Edwin Arnold's \"Light of Asia\". While in \"Duravastha\", he revealed his revolutionary zeal for fighting caste distinctions; a few other poetic works had a distinct Hindu/Buddhist slant.\n\nHe died aged 51 as a result of a boat accident in January 1924 while travelling to Kollam from a function in Alappuzha. The boat capsized at Pallana and all on board drowned, except his friend Ouseph Kurian Mappila Thannikuzhiyil Kanjirathanam . Kumaranasan was the only poet in Malayalam who became \"mahakavi\" without writing a \"mahakavyam\".\n\nThe Kumaran Asan National Institute of Culture at Thonnakkal was founded in 1958 in his memory, and includes a small house which he had built on his land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKumaran Asan also wrote many other poems. Some of these poems are listed in the book \"Asante Padyakrthikal\" under the name \"Mattu Krthikal\" (Other Works):\n\n\n\nThe other poems are lesser known. Only a few of them have names:\n\n\n\n"}

Along with Creek, it is also known as Seminole. It is spoken by the Miccosukee tribe and many Florida Seminole. The extinct Hitchiti was a mutually-intelligible dialect.\n\nThe Seminole and Miccosukee were made up of mostly Creek members of the Creek Confederacy, who had migrated to Florida under pressure from European-American encroachment. The Seminole formed by a process of ethnogenesis in the 18th century. American settlers began to enter Florida and came into conflict with the Seminole. The Seminole Wars of the 19th century greatly depleted the numbers of these tribes, specifically the Second Seminole War. The United States forcibly removed many Seminole to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The Seminole and Miccosukee had gradually moved into the center of Florida and the Everglades, from where they resisted defeat even in the Third Seminole War. The US gave up efforts against them.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Seminole and Miccosukee split apart, with the former moving onto reservations. The Miccosukee lived in communities that were affected by the early 20th-century construction of the Tamiami Trail, which brought tourists into the Everglades.\n\nThe Miccosukee achieved federal recognition as a tribe in 1962. Both tribes have speakers of Mikasuki today.\n\nAs of 2002, the language was taught in the local school, which had \"an area devoted to 'Miccosukee Language Arts'\".\n\nAs of 2011, the University of Florida Department of Anthropology is home to the Elling Eide Endowed Professorship in Miccosukee Language and Culture, for Native American languages of the southeastern United States.\n\nPresentations in the language have been featured at the Florida Folk Festival.\n\nThere are three tones: high, low and falling.

The mirror stage is based on the belief that infants recognize themselves in a mirror (literal) or other symbolic contraption which induces apperception (the turning of oneself into an object that can be viewed by the child from outside themselves) from the age of about six months.\n\nInitially, Lacan proposed that the mirror stage was part of an infant's development from 6 to 18 months, as outlined at the Fourteenth International Psychoanalytical Congress at Marienbad in 1936. By the early 1950s, Lacan's concept of the mirror stage had evolved: he no longer considered the mirror stage as a moment in the life of the infant, but as representing a permanent structure of subjectivity, or as the paradigm of \"Imaginary order\". This evolution in Lacan's thinking becomes clear in his later essay titled \"The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire\".\n\nLacan's concept of the mirror stage was strongly inspired by earlier work by psychologist Henri Wallon, who speculated based on observations of animals and humans responding to their reflections in mirrors. Wallon noted that by the age of about six months, human infants and chimpanzees both \"seem\" to recognize their reflection in a mirror. While chimpanzees rapidly lose interest in the discovery, human infants typically become very interested and devote much time and effort to exploring the connections between their bodies and their images. In a 1931 paper, Wallon argued that mirrors helped children develop a sense of self-identity. However, later mirror test research indicates that while toddlers are usually fascinated by mirrors, they do not actually recognize themselves in mirrors until the age of 15 months at the earliest, leading psychoanalytically trained critic Norman N. Holland to declare that \"there is no evidence whatsoever for Lacan's notion of a mirror stage\". Similarly, physician Raymond Tallis notes that a literal interpretation of the Lacanian mirror stage contradicts empirical observations about human identity and personality: \"If epistemological maturation and the formation of a world picture were dependent upon catching sight of oneself in a mirror, then the [mirror stage] theory would predict that congenitally blind individuals would lack selfhood and be unable to enter language, society or the world at large. There is no evidence whatsoever that this implausible consequence of the theory is borne out in practice.\"\n\nWallon's ideas about mirrors in infant development were distinctly non-Freudian and little-known until revived in modified form a few years later by Lacan. As Evans writes, \"Lacan used this observation as a springboard to develop an account of the development of human subjectivity that was inherently, though often implicitly, comparative in nature.\" Lacan attempted to link Wallon's ideas to Freudian psychoanalysis, but was met with indifference from the larger community of Freudian psychoanalysts. Richard Webster explains how the \"complex, and at times impenetrable paper ... appears to have made little or no lasting impression on the psychoanalysts who first heard it. It was not mentioned in Ernest Jones's brief account of the congress and received no public discussion.\"\n\nIn the 1930s, Lacan attended seminars by Alexandre Kojève, whose philosophy was heavily influenced by Hegel. The diachronic structure of the mirror stage theory is influenced by Kojève's interpretation of the Master-slave dialectic. Lacan continued to refine and modify the mirror stage concept through the remainder of his career; see below.\n\nDylan Evans argues that Lacan's earliest versions of the mirror stage, while flawed, can be regarded as a bold pioneering in the field of ethology (the study of animal behavior) and a precursor of both cognitive psychology and evolutionary psychology. In the 1930s, zoologists were increasingly interested in the then-new field of ethology, but not until the 1960s would the larger scientific community believe that animal behavior offered any insights into human behavior.\n\nHowever, Evans also notes that by the 1950s Lacan's mirror stage concept had become abstracted to the point that it no longer required a literal mirror, but could simply be the child's observation of observed behavior in the imitative gestures of another child or elder.\n\nThe child’s initiation into what Jacques Lacan would call the \"mirror stage\" entails a \"libidinal dynamism\" caused by the young child's identification with his own image and creation of what Lacan terms the \"Ideal-I\" or \"Ideal ego.\" This reflexivity inherent in fantasy is apparent in the mirror stage, since to recognize oneself as \"I\" is like recognizing oneself as other (\"yes, that person over there is me\"); this act is thus fundamentally self-alienating. Indeed, for this reason feelings towards the image are mixed, caught between hatred (\"I hate that version of myself because it is so much better than me\") and love (\"I want to be like that image\"). A type of repetition compulsion develops from this vacillation as the attempt to locate a fixed subject proves ever elusive. \"The mirror stage is a drama…which manufactures for the subject, caught up in the lure of spatial identification, the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality.” This misrecognition (seeing an ideal-I where there is a fragmented, chaotic body) subsequently \"characterizes the ego in all its structures.\"\n\nAs Lacan further develops the mirror stage concept, the stress falls less on its historical value and ever more on its structural value. \"Historical value\" refers to the mental development of the child and \"structural value\" to the libidinal relationship with the body image. In Lacan's fourth Seminar, \"La relation d'objet\", he states that \"the mirror stage is far from a mere phenomenon which occurs in the development of the child. It illustrates the conflictual nature of the dual relationship\". The dual relationship (\"relation duelle\") refers not only to the relation between the Ego and the body, which is always characterized by illusions of similarity and reciprocity, but also to the relation between the Imaginary and the Real. The visual identity given from the mirror supplies imaginary \"wholeness\" to the experience of a fragmentary real. See Lacan's paper, \"The Mirror Stage as formative of the function of the \"I\" as revealed in psychoanalytic experience\", the first of his \"Écrits.\"\n\nThe mirror stage describes the formation of the Ego via the process of identification, the Ego being the result of identifying with one's own specular image. At six months the baby still lacks coordination (see Louis Bolk); however, Lacan hypothesized that the baby can recognize itself in the mirror before attaining control over its bodily movements. The child sees its image as a whole, but this contrasts with the lack of coordination of the body and leads the child to perceive a fragmented body. This contrast, Lacan hypothesized, is first felt by the infant as a rivalry with its own image, because the wholeness of the image threatens it with fragmentation; thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the subject identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart is what forms the Ego. (Evans, 1996) The moment of identification is to Lacan a moment of jubilation since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery. (\"Écrits\", \"The Mirror Stage\") Yet, the jubilation may also be accompanied by a depressive reaction, when the infant compares his own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother. (\"La relation d'objet\") This identification also involves the ideal ego which functions as a promise of future wholeness sustaining the Ego in anticipation.\n\nThe mirror stage, Lacan also hypothesized, shows that the Ego is the product of misunderstanding – Lacan's term \"méconnaissance\" implies a false recognition. Additionally, the mirror stage is where the subject becomes alienated from itself, and thus is introduced into the Imaginary order.\n\nThe Mirror Stage has also a significant symbolic dimension. The Symbolic order is present in the figure of the adult who is carrying the infant: the moment after the subject has jubilantly assumed his image as his own, he turns his head toward this adult who represents the big Other, as if to call on him to ratify this image. (Tenth Seminar, \"L'angoisse\", 1962–1963)\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17713862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17713862", "title": "Navajo phonology", "text": "Navajo phonology\n\nThe phonology of Navajo is intimately connected to its morphology. For example, the entire range of contrastive consonants is found only at the beginning of word stems. In stem-final position and in prefixes, the number of contrasts is drastically reduced. Similarly, vowel contrasts (including their prosodic combinatory possibilities) found outside of the stem are significantly neutralized.\n\nLike most Athabascan languages, Navajo is coronal heavy, having many phonological contrasts at coronal places of articulation and less at other places. Also typical of the family, Navajo has a limited number of labial sounds, both in terms of its phonemic inventory and in their occurrence in actual lexical items and displays of consonant harmony.\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Navajo are listed below.\n\nAll consonants are long, compared to English: with plain stops the hold is longer, with aspirated stops the aspiration is longer, and with affricates the frication is longer. The voice onset time of the aspirated and ejective stops is twice as long as that found in most non-Athabaskan languages. described Navajo consonants as \"doubled\" between vowels, but in fact they are equally long in all positions.\n\nAll stops and affricates, except for the bilabial and glottal, have a three-way laryngeal contrast between unaspirated, aspirated, and ejective. The labials are found in only a few words. Most of the contrasts in the inventory lie within coronal territory at the alveolar and palatoalveolar places of articulation.\n\nThe aspirated stops (orthographic , ) are typically aspirated with velar frication (they are phonetically affricates — homorganic in the case of , heterorganic in the case of ). The velar aspiration is also found on a labialized velar (orthographic ). There is variation within Navajo, however, in this respect: some dialects lack strong velar frication having instead a period of aspiration. An aspirated occurs only in loanwords, for instance \"Mísísípii\" , from English \"Mississippi\".\n\nSimilarly the unaspirated velar (orthographic ) is realized as with optional voiced velar frication following the stop burst: . The unaspirated lateral (orthographic ) typically has a voiced lateral release, , of a duration comparable to the release of the and much shorter than the unaspirated fricatives . However, the aspirated and ejective laterals are true fricatives.\n\nWhile the aspiration of stops is markedly long compared to most other languages, the aspiration of the affricates is quite short: the main feature distinguishing and from and is that the frication is half again as long in the latter: . is similarly long, . The ejectives , on the other hand, have short frication, presumably due to the lack of pulmonic airflow. There is a period of near silence before the glottalized onset of the vowel. In there may be a double glottal release, or a creaky onset to the vowel not found in the other ejective affricates.\n\nNavajo voiceless continuants are realized as fricatives. They are typically noisier than the fricatives that occur in English. The palato-alveolars are not labialized unlike English and other European languages.\n\nNavajo also does not have consistent phonetic voicing in the \"voiced\" continuant members. Although are described as voiced in impressionist descriptions, data from spectrograms shows that they may be partially devoiced during the constriction. In stem-initial position, tends to be fully voiced, has a slight tendency to be voiceless near the offset, is often mostly voiceless with phonetic voicing only at the onset, is also only partially voiced with voicing at onset. A more consistent acoustic correlate of the \"voicing\" is the duration of the consonant: \"voiceless\" consonants have longer durations than \"voiced\" consonants. Based on this, argues that the distinction is better captured with the notion of a fortis/lenis contrast. A further characteristic of voicing in Navajo is that it is marginally contrastive (see the voicing assimilation section).\n\nNavajo lacks a clear distinction between phonetic fricatives and approximants. Although the pair ~ has been described as a fricative and an approximant, respectively, the lack of a consistent contrast between the two phonetic categories and a similar patterning with other fricative pairs suggests that they are better described as continuants. Additionally, observations have been made about the less fricative-like nature of and the more fricative-like nature of .\n\nA more abstract analysis of Navajo posits two different phonemes (see the below for elaboration).\n\nThe glottalized sonorants are the result of \"d\"-effect on the non-glottalized counterparts. A strict structuralist analysis, such as that of and , considers them phonemic.\n\nConsonants involving a glottal closure — the glottal stop, ejective stops, and the glottalized sonorants — may have optional creaky voice on voiced sounds adjacent to the glottal gesture. Glottal stops may also be realized entirely as creaky voice instead of single glottal closure. Ejectives in Navajo differ from the ejectives in many other languages in that the glottal closure is not released near-simultaneously with the release of the oral closure (as is common in other languages) — it is held for a significant amount of time following oral release. The glottalized sonorants are articulated with a glottal stop preceding the oral closure with optional creaky voice during the oral closure: .\n\nConsonants are predictable variants that occur before the rounded oral vowel . However, these sounds also occur before the vowels where they contrast with their non-labialized counterparts .\n\nThe phonological contrast between the velar obstruent and the palatal glide is neutralized in certain contexts. However, in these contexts, they may often be distinguished from each other by their different phonological patterning.\n\nBefore the rounded , is phonetically strongly labialized as ; elsewhere, it lacks the labialization. As noted above, the lenis continuants like are often very weak fricatives somewhere between a typical fricative constriction (e.g. ) and a more open approximant constriction (e.g. ) — this will be symbolized here as . describes the realization as being similar to English but differing in having slight frication at the beginning of the articulation. The realization before varies between an approximant and a weakly fricated approximant . The following verb stem has different velar allophones of the stem-initial consonant:\n\nThe palatal glide is also phonetically between an approximant and a fricative . compares it to English with a \"slight but audible 'rubbiness' or frication.\"\n\nThe contrast between velar and palatal is found before both back vowels as the following contrasts demonstrate:\n\nBefore the front vowels , however, the contrast between and is neutralized to a palatal articulation much like the weakly fricative realization of that occurs before back vowels. However, the underlying consonant can be ascertained in verb stems and noun stems via their different realizations in a voiceless (i.e. fortis) context. The underlying velar surfaces as a voiceless palatal fricative in these environments:\n\nThe stem-initial velar of the noun stem has a voiceless fortis realization of (as ) when word-initial. When intervocalic, it is realized as lenis (as ). Likewise, the underlying velar of the verb stem is a voiceless after the preceding voiceless and lenis when intervocalic. Thus, the alternation of in the two contexts is indicative of an underlying velar consonant. Similarly before the back vowels, the velar continuant has the alternations and as shown in the examples below:\n\nAn underlying palatal can determined by alternations which differ from the velar alternations. However, has two different alternation patterns which have led to the positing of two distinct phonemes. Incidentally, the two different phonemes are also connected to two different reconstructed consonants in Proto-Athabascan. One of these phonemes is considered an obstruent as it has a fricative realization of in fortis contexts. It is often symbolized as a palatalized (or front velar) fricative (in Americanist phonetic notation) and is a reflex of Proto-Athabascan . It may be considered coronal because of its coronal voiceless allophone.\n\nIn the above examples, the fortis realization is in the stems , , while the lenis realization is the glide in the corresponding , , . Since the fortis reflex of this phoneme is there is also a neutralization between this phoneme and the alveolar phoneme. The alveolar phoneme has a alternation in fortis-lenis contexts:\n\nThus, the different alternations also distinguish between underlying and underlying .\n\nThe other underlying (or morphophonemic) palatal is considered a sonorant and has an invariant realization in both fortis (voiceless) and lenis (voiced) contexts. This phoneme is relatively rare, occurring in only a few morphemes. It is a reflex of Proto-Athabascan (as symbolized in Americanist notation). Two examples are below:\n\nA further distinction between the different phonemes are found in the context of d-effect.\n\nThe varying contextual realizations of these three underlying segments are summarized in the following table:\n\nThe voiced continuants at the beginning of stems vary with their voiceless counterparts , respectively. The voiceless variants occur when preceded by voiceless consonants, such as while the voiced variants occur between voiced sounds (typically intervocalically). For example, the verb stems meaning 'spit it out', 'be burning', 'spit', and 'be ticklish' have the following forms with alternating voiced and voiceless stem-initial consonants:\n\nSince the voicing is predictable, it can be represented more abstractly as an underlying consonant that is underspecified with respect to voicing. These archiphonemes can be indicated with the capital letters . The variant voicing of the stem-initial consonant can be found in the context of subject person prefixes which are added to the verb stem:\n\nAs the above examples show, the stem-initial consonant is voiced when intervocalic and voiceless when it is preceded by a voiceless first person singular subject prefix or a voiceless in the two person dual subject prefix.\n\nAnother example of contextual voicing of verb-stem-initial consonants occurs when a voiceless classifier prefix occurs before the stem as in the following:\n\nIn the verb-form ('we two dribble it along'), the occurs between a voiced and the voiced stem vowel . Thus it is realized as a voiced . Here the classifier is voiced due to the d-effect of the preceding first person dual subject prefix. In the other verb-forms, the stem-initial is preceded by voiceless classifier which results in a voiceless realization of . In the surface verb-forms, the underlying classifier is not pronounced due to a phonotactic restriction on consonant clusters.\n\nThe initial consonant of noun stems also display contextual voicing:\n\nHere an intervocalic context is created by inflecting the nouns , , , with a third person prefix which ends in a vowel. In this context, the stem-initial consonant is voiced. When these nouns lack a prefix (in which case the stem-initial consonant is word-initial), the realization is voiceless.\n\nHowever, in some noun stems, the stem-initial continuant does not voice when intervocalic: ('salt').\n\nThe dorsal consonants (written , , , , ) have contextual phonetic variants (i.e. allophones) varying along place of articulation that depend on the following vowel environment. They are realized as palatals before the front vowels and and as velars before the back vowels and . Additionally, they are labialized before the rounded back vowel . This likewise happens with the velar frication of the aspirated .\n\nNavajo has coronal sibilant consonant harmony. Alveolar sibilants in prefixes assimilate to post-alveolar sibilants in stems, and post-alveolar prefixal sibilants assimilate to alveolar stem sibilants. For example, the \"si-\" stative perfective is realized as \"si-\" or \"shi-\" depending upon whether the stem contains a post-alveolar sibilant. For example, while \"sido\" ('it is hot' perfective) has the first form, \"shibeezh\" ('it is boiled' perfective), the stem-final triggers the change to .\n\nA particular type of morphophonemic alternation (or mutation) occurring in Athabascan languages called \"d-effect\" is found in Navajo. The alternation in most cases is a fortition (or strengthening) process. The initial consonant of a verb stem alternates with a strengthened consonant when it is preceded by a (orthographic ) \"classifier\" prefix or the first person dual subject prefix. The underlying of these prefixes is absorbed into the following stem. D-effect can be viewed prosodically as the result of a phonotactic constraint on consonant clusters that would otherwise result from the concatenation of underlying segments. There is thus an interaction between a requirement for the grammatical information to be expressed in the surface form and an avoidance of having sequences of consonants (see the syllable section for more on phonotactics).\n\nThe fortition is typically a change from continuant to affricate or continuant to stop (i.e. adding a period of closure to the articulation). However, other changes involve glottalization of the initial consonant:\n\nThe two occurrences of in the chart above reflect two different patterns of d-effect involving stem-initial . Often different underlying consonants are posited to explain the different alternation. The first alternation is posited as a result of underlying leading to a d-effect mutation of . The other is resulting in . (See the velar /ɣ/, palatal /j/ section for further explanation.)\n\nAnother example of d-effect influences not the stem-initial consonant but the classifier prefix. When the first person dual subject prefix precedes the (orthographic ) classifier prefix, the classifier is realized as voiced :\n\n\nNavajo has four contrastive vowel qualities at three different vowel heights (high, mid, low) and a front-back contrast between the mid vowels . There are also two contrastive vowel lengths and a contrast in nasalization. This results in 16 phonemic vowels, shown below.\n\nThere is a phonetic vowel quality difference between the long high vowel (orthographic ) and the short high vowel (orthographic ): the shorter vowel is significantly lower at than its long counterpart. This phonetic difference is salient to native speakers, who will consider a short vowel at a higher position to be a mispronunciation. Similarly, short is pronounced . Short is a bit more variable and more centralized, covering the space . Notably, the variation in does not approach , which is a true gap in the vowel space.\n\nAlthough the nasalization is contrastive in the surface phonology, many instances of nasalized vowels can be derived from a sequence of Vowel + Nasal consonant in a more abstract analysis. Additionally, there are alternations between long and short vowels that are predictable.\n\nThere have been a number of somewhat different descriptions of Navajo vowels, which are conveniently summarized in .\n\n has acoustic measurements of the formants of Navajo long and short vowel pairs as pronounced by 10 female and 4 male native speakers. Below are the median values of the first (F1) and second (F2) formants for this study.\n\nAn earlier study () has measurements from seven female speakers:\n\nNavajo has two tones: high and low. Orthographically, high tone is marked with an acute accent over the affected vowel, while low tone is left unmarked This reflects the tonal polarity of Navajo, as syllables have low tone by default.\n\nLong vowels normally have level tones . However, in grammatical contractions and in Spanish loan words such as ('money' from Spanish ), long vowels may have falling or rising tones.\n\nThe sonorant also carries tone when it is syllabic. Here again, the high tone is marked with an acute while the low tone is left unmarked .\n\nEven though low tone is the default, these syllables are not underspecified for tone: they have a distinct phonetic tone, and their pitch is not merely a function of their environment. This contrasts with the related Carrier language. As in many languages, however, the pitches at the beginnings of Navajo vowels are lower after voiced consonants than after tenuis and aspirated consonants. After ejective consonants, only high tones are lowered, so that the distinction between high and low tone is reduced. However, the type of consonant has little effect on the pitch in the middle of the vowel, so that vowels have characteristic rising pitches after voiced consonants.\n\nThe pitch of a vowel is also affected by the tone of the previous syllable: in most cases, this has as great an effect on the pitch of a syllable as its own tone. However, this effect is effectively blocked by an intervening aspirated consonant.\n\nNavajo nouns are simple: \"kǫ́\" ('fire'), \"bidił\" ('his blood'). Most long nouns are actually deverbal.\n\nIn verbs, with few exceptions, only stems may carry a high tone: CV(ː)(C)(T). Prefixes are mostly single consonants, C-, and do not carry tone. The one exception is the high-tone vocalic prefix . Most other tone-bearing units in the Navajo verb are second stems or clitics.\n\nAll Navajo verbs can be analyzed as compounds, and this greatly simplifies the description of tone. There are two obligatory components, the \"I\" stem (for \"inflection\") and the \"V\" stem (for \"verb\"), each potentially bearing a high tone, and each preceded by its own prefixes. In addition, the compound as a whole takes 'agreement' prefixes like the prefixes found on nouns. This entire word may then take proclitics, which may also carry tone:\n\nAny high tones on clitics and the prefix spread to the next syllable of the word. This spreading is blocked by long vowels, as can be seen with the iterative clitic . Compare\nand\nwhere the clitic \"nɑ́=\" creates a high tone on the following syllable, but,\nwhere it does not.\n\n\n\"Stems.\" The stems (e.g. noun stems, verb stems, etc.) have the following syllable types:\n\nThat is, all syllables must have a consonant onset C, a vowel nucleus V. The syllable may carry a high tone T, the vowel nucleus may be short or long, and there may optionally be a consonant coda.\n\n\"Prefixes.\" Prefixes typically have a syllable structure of CV-, such as \"chʼí-\" ('out horizontally'). Exceptions to this are certain verbal prefixes, such as the classifiers (\"-ł-\", \"-l-\", \"-d-\") that occur directly before the verb stem, which consist of a single consonant -C-. A few other verbal prefixes, such as \"naa-\" ('around') on the outer left edge of the verb have long vowels, CVV-. A few prefixes have more complex syllable shapes, such as \"hashtʼe-\" ('ready') (CVCCV-). Prefixes do not carry tone.\n\nSome analyses, such as that of Harry Hoijer, consider conjunct verbal prefixes to have the syllable shape CV-. In other generative analyses, the same prefixes are considered to have only underlying consonants of the shape C-. Then, in certain environments, an epenthetic vowel (the default vowel is ) is inserted after the consonantal prefix.\n\nAll verbs must be disyllabic. Some verbs may only have a single overt nonsyllabic consonantal prefix or a prefix lacking an onset, or no prefix at all before the verb stem. Since all verbs are required to have two syllables, a meaningless prefix must be added to the verb to fulfill the disyllabic requirement. This prosodic prefix is known as a \"peg element\" in Athabascan terminology (Edward Sapir used the term \"pepet vowel\"). For example, the verb meaning \"she/he/they is/are crying\" has the following morphological composition: \"Ø-Ø-cha\" where both the imperfective modal prefix and the third person subject prefix are phonologically null morphemes and the verb stem is \"-cha\". In order for this verb to be complete a \"yi-\" peg element must be prefixed to the verb stem, resulting in the verb form \"yicha\". Another examples are verb \"yishcha\" ('I'm crying') which is morphologically \"Ø-sh-cha\" (\"Ø-\" null imperfective modal, \"-sh-\" first person singular subject, \"-cha\" verb stem) and \"wohcha\" ('you [2+] are crying') which is \"Ø-oh-cha\" (\"Ø-\" null imperfective modal, \"-oh-\" second person dual-plural subject, \"-cha\" verb stem). The glide consonant of the peg element is before , before , and before .\n\n\n"}

This note focuses on ‘official’ Australian co-productions, that is, co-productions that meet the requirements for benefits under the Australian Official Co-Production Program. It looks at trends in production, the potential impact of recent changes to film funding, and what lies ahead for Australia’s involvement in co-production.\n\nOfficial co-productions are made possible by formal agreements between countries. For filmmakers, the key attraction of a treaty co-production is that it qualifies as a national production in each of the partner nations. Thus, it can access benefits that are available to the local film and television industry in more than one country. Benefits may include government subsidies, tax concessions and inclusion in domestic television broadcast quotas.\n\nThe Australian government has signed official film co-production agreements with the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Ireland, Israel, Germany, China and, most recently, Singapore (as treaties); and France and New Zealand (as memoranda of understanding or MOUs. Official co-production agreements set the criteria that a production must meet in order to be considered an official co-production. Criteria may cover co-financing, creative participation and copyright ownership.\n\nInternational co-productions also occur outside the framework of official co-productions, either with countries that do not have an agreement with Australia, or as projects that do not satisfy official co-production criteria. Examples of the former include the Australia/US co-productions \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles\" (2001) and \"Farscape\" (1999–2003).\n\nAustralian co-production agreements are administered by the Australian Film Commission (AFC) on behalf of the Australian Government. (In July 2008 the AFC will be merged with other film agencies to become Screen Australia; the new organisation will then have oversight over co-productions.) The overriding objective is to maintain an overall balance between the creative and financial contributions of each country over time. Accordingly, there is some discretion in granting co-production status to an individual co-production if there is an imbalance between financial and creative contributions.\n\nThe AFC’s International Co-production Program Guidelines set out eligibility conditions for the granting of co-production status. These relate to the authorship of the underlying works and screenplays, co-producer participation, sources of finance, control over copyright; and the engagement of key creative participants. Co-productions are restricted to particular genres: feature films, drama series, miniseries, documentaries and telemovies. At the level of the individual production there must be a producer from each of the partner countries, a minimum level of Australian equity in the project (20 to 30 per cent) and matching participation by Australian creative components.\n\nA points system is used to ensure a balance between the Australian budget contribution and the participation of key personnel (creative and crew). Points are attached to key creative positions including director, writer, editor and key cast. By amassing a minimum number of points, a production can qualify as ‘Australian’. In this context the participation of Australian financial and creative resources acts as a proxy for ‘Australian content’. Different points systems apply to the production of live action drama, documentary and animation, reflecting the importance of particular roles specific to each genre.\n\nAustralia was a relatively late entrant into the sphere of official co-production. Its first agreement was signed with France in 1986. France itself entered into a co-production agreement with Italy in 1949 while Canada, a leading co-production country, entered its first agreement in 1963 and now has agreements with 53 other countries.\n\nAs of April 2007, Australia had engaged in 96 official co-productions that were either completed or in production. Feature films and television drama are the production types most likely to be co-productions: they total 35 and 21 productions respectively, with total budgeted costs of A$385.15 million and A$294.71 million. Australia has partnered most frequently with Canada and the United Kingdom. Australia and Canada have produced 31 co-productions with budgets totalling A$347 million and Australia and the United Kingdom have co-produced 30 productions, with budgets of A$323.43 million.\n\nAustralia’s official co-production record is modest by international standards. In 2005–2006 Australia engaged in 10 co-productions with total budgets of $60 million and an Australian spend of $35m. Canada, by comparison, had 58 co-productions in 2006 with total budgets in excess of C$404 million and a Canadian share of C$166 million. In the same year, the United Kingdom had 57 productions with total budgets of ₤124.8 million.\n\nFurther, co-productions represent a small proportion of the Australian industry. In 2005–2006, 32 feature films were made in Australia. Of these, four were foreign and only three were co-productions. Domestic expenditure for local films was A$97 million and for foreign films was A$23 million, while co-productions totalled a modest A$13 million. Similarly, local television drama in the six years to 2005–2006 had an average annual spend of A$202 million, while foreign drama and co-productions amounted to A$37 million apiece.\n\nAlthough co-productions contributed only a small proportion of total production budgets in Australia, individual co-productions tend to have higher budgets. Of the 35 co-produced feature films, 49 per cent had budgets in excess of $10m. By comparison, only 18% of all Australian-produced features between 1988/89 and 2005/06 reached this level. Mini-series showed a similar bias: 90% of co-productions had budgets between $6 and $20m compared with just 61% of all series over the same period.\n\nCo-production is a more common production mode for children’s television drama. In the six years to 2005/06, the Australian industry averaged 96 hours of co-produced TV drama, at budgets of $61.8m. Of this, 27 hours were dedicated to children’s drama, at average annual budgets of $16.1m. The higher reliance on co-production for children’s content stems from the difficulty of financing children’s programs, and the ability of children’s animation to translate easily into different cultures.\n\nWhile the trend through the 1990s was for a greater total spend in Australia for co-productions, reaching a high of $111m in 2001/2002, the trend since then has been downward, with only $36m being spent in 2005/06. This is largely due to a fall in television drama co-production from a high of $83m in 2001/02 to just $23m in 2005/06. Feature films, on the other hand, have experienced a revival from 2000/01, but have only averaged a modest $22.2m in Australian spend in the six years from 2001/02.\n\nA number of economic, industry and cultural factors influence decisions to undertake an official co-production. These factors include the value of the Australian dollar, the availability of skilled crews, access to tax offsets and other financial incentives, the generation of creative content and the signing of further bilateral agreements. Higher production budgets, falling television licence fees and lower distribution guarantees are all factors that will continue to drive the international demand for co-productions. As discussed by Hoskins, McFadyen, & Finn, Australian producers find financial pooling the most important benefit of co-production and it is likely that this will be pursued more vigorously in the future.\n\nThe recently introduced Producer Offset is also expected to drive a higher level of co-production. Australian production companies making official co-productions will be automatically entitled to a tax offset of 40% of qualifying Australian production expenditure (QAPE) for feature films and 20% of QAPE for documentary, television series, telemovies and short animation.\n\nAn increase in the number of countries with which Australia has co-production agreements may also encourage greater levels of co-production. Australia recently entered into agreements with China and Singapore, increasing the number of agreements to 11. Further, Australia has signed agreements with a number of European countries which are parties to the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production. Indirectly, this convention may provide further opportunities for collaboration with other European Union countries.\n\nNoting the favourable performance results for Australian co-productions, Hoskins, McFadyen and Finn advocate 'greater government initiative in treaty negotiation and increased official openness to international co-production'. As the Australian film financing landscape shifts over the coming period, there is every chance that these policy issues will provide the grist for further discussions. At the same time, we can expect that Australian producers and their international partners will seek out innovative ways to harness the benefits of co-production, particularly in light of the new tax regime.\n"}

{"id": "36628582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36628582", "title": "Plastic Brit", "text": "Plastic Brit\n\nPlastic Brit, or Plastic Briton, is a pejorative term used to describe athletes who choose to represent Great Britain in international sport despite having personal connections to another country. Some media critics believe it undermines the purpose of international sport for the purpose of medals. The term came into popular use in 2012 when it was reported that 61 out of 542 (11%) of the British Olympic team had been born abroad.\n\nThe term \"Plastic Brit\" is derived from Plastic Paddy, which is used to describe people who claim to be Irish despite not residing in that country. While the concept gained the British media's attention in the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics, it had also been used in describing members of other British sporting teams. England's cricket team had a perceived problem of having too many foreign-born players. The England and Wales Cricket Board responded to the issue by lengthening the residency period before a foreign player can be accepted to play for England to seven years.\n\nThe term was popularised in the United Kingdom through its usage in the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper to describe athletes born outside the UK who had been selected to represent Great Britain at the London 2012 Summer Olympics. The term originally had foundations from South African-born Zola Budd having her British citizenship application fast tracked in order to represent Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nSeveral athletes have been described by the press as \"Plastic Brits\". Tiffany Porter was selected as the captain of Great Britain's athletics team at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships despite being born in the United States. She was described as a \"Plastic Brit\" in the media for refusing to recite the words of the British national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\", at a press conference. After Porter broke the British record for the 100 metres hurdles, the previous record holder Angela Thorp said that she felt \"devastated\" that Porter had broken her record because she had expected Jessica Ennis to break it.\n\nThe term was used to describe a number of amateur wrestlers such as Myroslav Dykun and Yana Stadnik who had not been born in the UK and had been given British citizenship. Only one wrestler had competed for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, Ukrainian-born Olga Butkevych. British Wrestling had the majority of its host nation berths removed by the British Olympic Association because of British Wrestling's failing to reach set performance targets. The term \"Plastic Brit\" was also used when there were calls for Arsenal's Spanish goalkeeper Manuel Almunia to play for the England national football team in 2009.\n\nIt was argued by some newspaper reporters that selecting athletes born outside of the UK was discriminatory against British-born athletes and was against the spirit of the Olympics. In 2012, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) imposed a mandatory three-year waiting period before athletes could compete in the Olympics for another country.<ref name=\"Magnay/Telegraph\"></ref> In response, International Olympic Committee chairman Jacques Rogge said, \"Then there are cases where there is support [for athletes competing for other countries] but they go because there is a bigger gain [for the athlete] in another country. Legally we can't stop it but it doesn't mean we love it.\" In 2015, the term was also erroneously levelled at sprinter Zharnel Hughes by some newspapers despite Hughes having British citizenship by virtue of being born in Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory without IOC recognition.\n\nThe term \"Plastic Brit\" has been criticised in the British media. The \"Daily Telegraph\" suggested that fans overlook athletes' places of birth if they perform well for Great Britain. \"The Guardian\" newspaper criticised the \"Daily Mail\"s usage of the term, saying that the definition of a \"Plastic Brit\" was inconsistent and that under some definitions, some British-born athletes such as Ryan Giggs would be classed as \"Plastic Brits\" for failing to sing \"God Save the Queen\". The \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper also said that the \"Daily Mail\", along with other newspapers, had supported the selection of Zola Budd to represent Great Britain at the 1984 Olympic Games. \"The Independent\" newspaper said that a third of Great Britain's gold medal winners at the Olympics and Paralympic games had a non-British parent or had been born outside of the UK.\n\nA number of athletes were also critical of the term. Triple jumper Yamilé Aldama, who had been described as a \"Plastic Brit\", openly criticised the term in an article in \"The Guardian\" newspaper. She said, \"I have lived in this country for 11 years, I am married to a British man, I have British children, I train under a British coach, at a British club. This is my home. What are they talking about?\". She also said that a number of other athletes, including Farah and Kevin Pietersenwho had represented Great Britain and the England cricket team respectivelyhad not been born in the United Kingdom but were not branded as \"Plastic Brits\".<ref name=\"Aldama/Guardian\"></ref> Marathon runner Paula Radcliffe also criticised the term, asking for Great Britain supporters at the Olympics to support every athlete representing Great Britain, regardless of their countries of origin. Long-distance runner Mo Farah, when asked by a journalist if he should run for Somalia, said, \"Look mate, this is my country. This is where I grew up, this is where I started life. This is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest I'm proud. I'm very proud.\" Fijian-born Paralympic discus thrower Derek Derenalagi said in the \"Evening Standard\" that he was a \"Titanium Brit\" after he lost his legs in an explosion while serving with the British Army.\n"}
{"id": "9776805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9776805", "title": "Quirky subject", "text": "Quirky subject\n\nIn linguistics, quirky subjects (also called oblique subjects) are a phenomenon where certain verbs specify that their subjects are to be in a case other than the nominative.\n\nFor example, a sentence like \"*Me like him\" is ungrammatical in Standard English because the subject is ordinarily in the nominative. In many or most modern nominative–accusative languages, this rule is inflexible: the subject is indeed in the nominative case, and almost all treat the subjects of all verbs the same. Icelandic has been argued to be the only modern language with quirky subjects, and is thus of interest to linguistics.\n\nThe class of quirky subjects in Icelandic is a large one, consisting of hundreds of verbs in a number of distinct classes: experiencer verbs like \"vanta\" (need/lack), motion verbs like \"reka\" (drift), change of state verbs like \"ysta\" (curdle), verbs of success/failure like \"takast\" (succeed/manage to), verbs of acquisition like \"áskotnast\" (acquire/get by luck), and many others.\n\nIn superficially similar constructions of the type seen in Spanish \"me gusta\" \"I like\", the analogous part of speech (in this case \"me\") is not a true syntactical subject. \"Me\" is instead the object of the verb \"gusta\" which has a meaning closer to \"please\", thus, \"me gusta\" could be translated as \"(he/she/it) pleases me\".\n\nMany linguists, especially from various persuasions of the broad school of cognitive linguistics, do not use the term \"quirky subjects\" since the term is biased towards languages of nominative–accusative type. Often, \"quirky subjects\" are semantically motivated by the predicates of their clauses. Dative-subjects, for example, quite often correspond with predicates indicating sensory, cognitive, or experiential states across a large number of languages. In some cases, this can be seen as evidence for the influence of active–stative typology.\n\nIn Icelandic, verbs can require a non-nominative subject. The following examples show an accusative subject and a dative subject, respectively. \n\nQuirky subject can also occur when verbs taking a dative or genitive argument occur in the passive.\n\n"}

For example, in \"the red car is fancier than the blue one\", \"red\" and \"blue\" are restrictive, because they restrict which cars \"car\" and \"one\" are referring to. (\"The car is fancier than the one\" would make little sense.) By contrast, in \"John's beautiful mother\", \"beautiful\" is non-restrictive; \"John's mother\" identifies her sufficiently, whereas \"beautiful\" only serves to add more information.\n\nRestrictive modifiers are also called \"defining\", \"identifying\", \"essential\", or \"necessary\"; non-restrictive ones are also called \"non-defining\", \"non-identifying\", \"descriptive\", or \"unnecessary\" (though this last term can be misleading). In certain cases, generally when restrictiveness is marked syntactically through the lack of commas, restrictive modifiers are called \"integrated\" and non-restrictive ones are called \"non-integrated\" or \"supplementary\".\n\nEnglish does not generally mark modifiers for restrictiveness, with the exception of relative clauses: non-restrictive ones are set off in speech through intonation (with a pause beforehand and ) and in writing by using commas, whereas restrictive clauses are not. Furthermore, although restrictive clauses can be headed by any of the relative pronouns \"who(m)\", \"which\", \"that\" or by a zero, non-restrictive clauses can only be headed by \"who(m)\" or \"which\". For example:\n\n\nAlthough English does not consistently mark ordinary adjectives for restrictiveness, they can be marked periphrastically by moving them into relative clauses. For example, \"John's beautiful wife\" can be rewritten as \"John's wife, who is beautiful\", to avoid the suggestion of disambiguation between John's various wives. A sentence unmarked for restrictiveness, like \"The red car is fancier than the blue one,\" can—if necessary—be rephrased to make it explicitly restrictive or non-restrictive: \n\nEnglish speakers do not generally find such locutions necessary, however.\n\n\nOn the intonation question, see Beverly Colins and Inger M.

Saul, the eldest son, was given an education in both the Talmud and secular subjects. His brother, Solomon Hirschell, eventually became Chief Rabbi of Great Britain.\n\nSaul Berlin was ordained as a rabbi at 20. By 1768, aged 28, he had a rabbinic post in Frankfort-on-the-Oder in the Prussian province of Brandenburg. He married Sarah, the daughter of Rabbi Joseph Jonas Fraenkel of Breslau.\n\nIn Berlin and Breslau (where he frequently went to visit his father-in-law, R. Joseph Jonas Fränkel), he came into personal contact with the representatives of the Jewish Enlightenment, and became one of its most enthusiastic adherents.\n\nBerlin began his literary career with an anonymous circular letter, \"Ketav Yosher\" (An Epistle of Justice) (printed in Berlin, 1794, after the death of the author), which Hartwig Wessely warmly defended in his own contention with the rabbis while pleading for German education among the Jews. Berlin used humor to describe what he viewed as the absurd methods of the Jewish schools, and alleges how the rabbinic casuistry—which then constituted the greater part of the curriculum—injures the sound common sense of the pupils and deadens their noblest aspirations. \n\nHe later wrote the pseudonymous work, \"Mitzpeh Yekutiel\" (The Watch-Tower of Yekutiel) (published by David Friedländer and his brother-in-law Itzig, Berlin, 1789), a polemic against the \"Torat Yekutiel\" of Raphael Kohen. The latter, one of the most zealous advocates of rabbinic piety, was a rival candidate with Levin for the Berlin rabbinate, which induced Levin's son to represent ha-Kohen as a forbidding example of rabbinism. \n\nUnder the name \"Ovadiah b. Baruch of Poland,\" Berlin attempted in this work to ridicule Talmudic science, and to stigmatize one of its foremost exponents not only as ignorant, but also as dishonest. The publishers declared in the preface that they had received the work from a traveling Polish Talmudist, and had considered it their duty to print it and submit it to the judgment of specialists. To secure the anonymity more thoroughly, Berlin and his father were named among those who were to pass upon it.\nBerlin's statements, especially his personal attacks against those he disagreed with, undermined his cause. When it reached Altona and Hamburg, where Raphael was chief rabbi, the work and its author was placed under the ban. The dispute that then arose concerning the validity of the ban turned entirely on the question of whether a personal element, like the attack upon the rabbi of Altona, justified such a punishment.\n\nSome Polish rabbis supported the ban, while some declared the ban invalid as did Ezekiel Landau, chief rabbi of Prague and a near relation of Berlin. Even the former censured Berlin's actions after circumstances forced him to acknowledge authorship.\nBefore the excitement over this affair had subsided, Berlin created a new sensation by another work. In 1793 he published in Berlin, under the title \"Besamim Rosh\" (Incense of Spices), 392 responsa purporting to be by Asher ben Jehiel, with many glosses and comments that he called \"Kassa de-Harsna\" (Fish Fare). Berlin says, for instance, ( in No. 257) that an insight into the principles of the Torah and its commands can not be gained directly from it or from tradition, but only by means of the philosophico-logical training derived from non-Jewish sources. However, Asher ben Jehiel had condemned the study of philosophy and even of the natural sciences as being un-Jewish and pernicious (compare No. 58 of Asher's genuine responsa). Besamim Rosh ascribes the following opinions are ascribed to the neo-Talmudists of the thirteenth century: \"Articles of faith [creed] must be adapted to the times; and at present the most essential article is that we all are utterly worthless and depraved, and that our only duty consists in loving truth and peace and learning to know God and His works\" (l.c.). R. Asher is also alleged to be the author of the two responsa concerning the modification of the ceremonial laws, especially of such as were burdensome to the Berlin youth. Thus, for instance, it should be permitted to shave (No. 18), to drink non-kosher wine, \"yayin nesek\" (No. 36), and to ride on \"Shabbat\". Berlin aroused a storm of indignation by thus fraudulently using the name of one of the most famous rabbis of the Middle Ages to combat rabbinism. \n\nMordecai Benet first attempted to prevent the printing of the book in Austria, and then argued deception in a circular letter addressed to Berlin's father, by critically analyzing the responsa and arguing that they were spurious. Levin tried in vain to defend his son. Berlin resigned his rabbinate and, to end the dispute, went to London where he died a few months later. In a letter found in his pocket, he warned everybody against looking into his papers, requesting that they be sent to his father. He expressed the wish to be buried not in a cemetery, but in some lonely spot, and in the same garments in which he died. The exact historicity of Besamin Rosh is still disputed, with it being unclear which parts are forgeries.\n\nTo understand this unique personality, note that, as a modern historian remarks, that Berlin was a focal point for the rays of a sinking and rising period in Jewish history. Being a great Talmudist, he knew better how to attack rabbinism, and was filled with a burning desire to lead his people toward intellectual freedom. Mendelssohn's and Wessely's timid attempts to inaugurate a new era did not appeal to him. With his youthful ardor he could not understand that the development of the popular consciousness is a slow process. An open championship of his ideas, however, would have meant a breach with father, wife, and children—in short, with all his associates; it being after all doubtful whether his sacrifices would have helped his cause. His anonymous and pseudonymous authorship was a measure of policy and not of cowardice. He could not, however, escape the consequences of such a mode of warfare. It is debasing and embittering to attack secretly those whom one is forced to praise in public. Hence Berlin became personal in his polemics, and nervous and dissatisfied with himself and the world because he knew he was misunderstood through his own fault.\n\nBesides the works mentioned above, Berlin is said to have written a large number of rabbinic works, including notes to the whole Talmud.\n\n\n"}

These three blows could be preceded by eleven hammered ones (the twelve Apostles minus Judas). They may also be a tribute to the nine muses of ancient Greece. Hence, there would be nine rapid blows plus the \"trois coups\", thus twelve blows. Twelve, being a perfect number in its symbolism, symbolized the unity of theatre.\n\nAnother explanation matches the three blows with the three bows that comedians performed before playing in front of the Court: the first one to the contender (, left), the second one to the machinist (, right), and the third to the audience.\n\nIn French classical theatre, the dramaturge pounded the ground with twelve quick blows to announce to the machinists the start of the performance. Then a first blow came in response from the fly system operators; a second response rose from below the stage and a third one came from the opposite wing. Each machinist being in their position for the performance, the dramaturge could open the curtain. \n\nThe military rank of \"brigadier\" was given to a worker leading a team. The dramaturge, using a stick to hit the three blows, gathered the theatre staff to begin the show, like a brigadier gathering his men. Through metonymy, the stick itself was called a \"brigadier\".\n\nThe theatre brigadier is traditionally made of wood with a piece of theatre pole, decorated with red velvet and gold studded nails.\n\nFor years the Comédie-Française would hit six blows in order to commemorate the uniting of the two troupes, that of the Hôtel de Bourgogne and Molière's company, previously associated with that of the Théâtre du Marais under Louis XIV, allowing for daily performances.\n\n\n"}
