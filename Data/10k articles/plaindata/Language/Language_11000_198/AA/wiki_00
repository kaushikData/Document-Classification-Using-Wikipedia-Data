{"id": "381552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=381552", "title": "Allopathic medicine", "text": "Allopathic medicine\n\nAllopathic medicine or allopathy is a term used to refer to modern scientific systems of medicine, such as the use of pharmacologically active agents or physical interventions to treat or suppress symptoms or pathophysiologic processes of diseases or conditions, by proponents of alternative medicine. The expression was coined in 1810 by the creator of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843). In such circles, the expression \"allopathic medicine\" is still used to refer to \"the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, biomedicine, evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine\".\n\nAllopathic medicine and allopathy (from the Greek prefix \"ἄλλος\", \"állos\", \"other\", \"different\" + the suffix \"πάϑος\", \"páthos\", \"suffering\") are terms coined in the early 19th century by Samuel Hahnemann, the inventor of homeopathy, as a synonym for the European heroic medicine, the mainstream medicine of the time. Heroic medicine was based on balance of the four \"humours\" (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) where disease was caused by an excess of one humour, and would thus be treated with its opposite. This description continued to be used to describe anything that was not homeopathy.\n\nThe practice of medicine in both Europe and North America during the early 19th century is sometimes referred to as heroic medicine because of the extreme measures (such as bloodletting) sometimes employed in an effort to treat diseases. The term \"allopath\" was used by Hahnemann and other early homeopaths to highlight the difference they perceived between homeopathy and the medicine of that time.\n\nWith the term allopathy (meaning \"other than the disease\"), Hahnemann intended to point out how physicians with conventional training employed therapeutic approaches that, in his view, merely treated symptoms and failed to address the disharmony produced by the underlying disease. Homeopaths saw such symptomatic treatments as \"opposites treating opposites\" and believed these conventional methods were harmful to patients.\n\nPractitioners of alternative medicine have used the term \"allopathic medicine\" to refer to the practice of conventional medicine in both Europe and the United States since the 19th century. The term allopathic was used throughout the 19th century as a derogatory term for the practitioners of heroic medicine,<ref name=\"DOI 10.1177/0002716202583001002\"></ref> a precursor to modern medicine that did not rely on evidence.\n\nJames Whorton discusses this historical pejorative usage: \n\nThe controversy surrounding the term can be traced to its original usage during a heated 19th-century debate between practitioners of homeopathy and those they derisively referred to as \"allopaths.\"\n\nHahnemann used \"allopathy\" to refer to what he saw as a system of medicine that combats disease by using remedies that produce effects in a healthy subject that are different (hence Greek root \"allo-\" \"different\") from the effects produced by the disease to be treated. The distinction comes from the use in homeopathy of substances that are meant to cause similar effects as the symptoms of a disease to treat patients (\"homeo\" - meaning similar).\n\nAs used by homeopaths, the term \"allopathy\" has always referred to the principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for fever may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an antibiotic) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). A homeopathic treatment for fever, by contrast, is one that uses a diluted and succussed dosage of a substance, usually containing no actual particles of that substance, that in an undiluted and unsuccussed form would induce fever in a healthy person. Hahnemann used this term to distinguish medicine as practiced in his time from his use of infinitesimally small (or nonexistent) doses of substances to treat the spiritual causes of illness.\n\nThe \"Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine\" states that \"[Hahnemann] gave an all-embracing name to regular practice, calling it 'allopathy'. This term, however imprecise, was employed by his followers and other unorthodox movements to identify the prevailing methods as constituting nothing more than a competing 'school' of medicine, however dominant in terms of number of practitioner proponents and patients.\" In the nineteenth century, some pharmacies labeled their products with the terms allopathic or homeopathic.\n\nContrary to the present usage, Hahnemann reserved the term \"allopathic medicine\" to the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs inducing symptoms unrelated (i.e., neither similar nor opposite) to those of the disease. He called the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs producing symptoms opposite to those of the patient \"enantiopathic\" or \"antipathic medicine\". After Hahnemann's death, the term \"enantiopathy\" fell into disuse and the two concepts of allopathy and enantiopathy have been more or less unified. Both, however, indicate what Hahnemann thought about contemporary conventional medicine, rather than the current ideas of his colleagues. Conventional physicians had never assumed that the therapeutic effects of drugs were necessarily related to the symptoms they caused in the healthy: e.g., James Lind in 1747 systematically tested several common substances and foods for their effect on scurvy and discovered that lemon juice was specifically active; he clearly did not select lemon juice because it caused symptoms in the healthy man, either similar or opposite to those of scurvy.\n\nUse of the term remains common among homeopaths and has spread to other alternative medicine practices. The meaning implied by the label has never been accepted by conventional medicine and is still considered pejorative by some. William Jarvis, an expert on alternative medicine and public health, states that \"although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle\" and that the label \"allopath\" was \"considered highly derisive by regular medicine.\"\n\nMany conventional medical treatments clearly do not fit the nominal definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or remove the cause of an illness by acting on the cause of disease.\n"}

The same concept has been adopted in Japanese law under the name shinkokuzai, in South Korean law under the name chingojoe, and in the law of the Republic of China (both during the early Republic period and on Taiwan) using various terms.\n\nThe term comes from the German language words \"Antrag\" (petition) and \"Delikt\" (offence). \"Antragsdelikte\" are similar to, but not identical to \"Ermächtigungsdelikte\". For example, in Austria the latter category includes such offences as trespass or fraud committed in an emergency situation. The victim's consent is required for investigation of an \"Antragsdelikt\" to begin; no such consent is required in the case of an \"Ermächtigunsdelikt\", though the prosecutor will inform the victim. In both cases, actual prosecution of the offence will only proceed with the consent of the victim. Another term is \"Privatklagedelikte\".\n\n\"Antragsdelikt\" is somewhat analogous to the concept of a compoundable offence in Thai law, though different from that same term in Malaysian law or Singaporean law.\n\nThe German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) lists the following as offences which will only be prosecuted on request:\n\nIn addition, the German Criminal Code states that the following offences will be prosecuted on the request of the victim or in the case of \"special public interest\":\n\nThe concept of \"shinkokuzai\" first entered into Japanese law in the early Meiji period. The 1870 criminal code , though it did not use the term directly, stated that the prosecution of a number of violent offences between husband and wife depended on a complaint by the person in question. The phrase used to express this condition, \"mizukara tsugeru wo mate\", is probably the origin of the modern term \"shinkokuzai\"; \"mizukara tsugeru\" (to inform personally) contains two of the same kanji used to write \"shinkokuzai\". The draft criminal code of November 1877 used the term \"shinkokuzai\" directly in the definitions of various offences. Under modern Japanese law, sexual offences such as simple rape or indecent assault are categorised as \"shinkokuzai\", lest a prosecution against the victim's will result in secondary victimisation or infringement of privacy.\n\nIn South Korea, the following offences are categorised as \"chingojoe\":\n\nThe term \"qīn'gàozuì\" was used in laws in China's early Republic era (1912–1928), for example in the 1921 Criminal Procedure Ordinance or the 1928 Criminal Procedure Law. However, in modern terminology, the concept of a crime for which there will be no trial without complaint is usually expressed as \"gàosunǎilùn zhī zuì\" (告訴乃論之罪). A 1999 amendment to Taiwan's Criminal Code removed indecent assault and rape (with the exception of spousal rape) from this category.\n\nThe Criminal Code of the People's Republic of China uses the term \"gàosù cái chǔlǐ\" (告诉才处理, lit. \"action only if complained\"). There are currently five offenses in this category, all minor offenses against individuals: insult, defamation, infringement of freedom of marriage (usually by parents), maltreat (of family members) and ordinary embezzlement. However, the Criminal Code does state that any such offense resulting in serious consequences (e.g. serious injury or death) is prosecutable without complaint.\n\nWhile no formal class of law equivalent to the \"Antragsdelikt\" exists in the law of Egypt, several religious crimes, including apostasy, cannot be prosecuted on the initiative of the public prosecutor; the case must instead be raised by another citizen.\n\n"}

{"id": "58133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58133", "title": "Cancellation (mail)", "text": "Cancellation (mail)\n\nA cancellation (or cancel for short; French: \"oblitération\") is a postal marking applied on a postage stamp or postal stationery to deface the stamp and prevent its re-use. Cancellations come in a huge variety of designs, shapes, sizes and colors. Modern United States cancellations commonly include the date and post office location where the stamps were mailed, in addition to lines or bars designed to cover the stamp itself. The term \"postal marking\" sometimes is used to refer specifically to the part that contains the date and posting location, although the term often is used interchangeably with \"cancellation.\" The portion of a cancellation that is designed to deface the stamp and does not contain writing is also called the \"obliteration\" or killer. Some stamps are issued pre-cancelled with a printed or stamped cancellation and do not need to have a cancellation added. Cancellations can affect the value of stamps to collectors, positively or negatively. The cancellations of some countries have been extensively studied by philatelists and many stamp collectors and postal history collectors collect cancellations in addition to the stamps themselves.\n\nThe first adhesive postage stamp was the Penny Black, issued in 1840 by Great Britain. The postal authorities recognized there must be a method for preventing reuse of the stamps and simultaneously issued handstamps for use to apply cancellations to the stamps on the envelopes as they passed through the postal system. The cancels were handmade and depicted a Maltese cross design. Initially, the ink used was red, but it was found that this could be cleaned off and the stamps reused, and so after a series of experiments, early in 1841 black cancelling ink was used, which was more permanent. The color of the stamps was also changed to red-brown so as to ensure that the cancellation showed clearly.\n\nBritain soon abandoned the Maltese crosses and in 1844 began to employ cancellations displaying numbers which referred to the location of mailing. A similar scheme was used for British stamps used abroad in its colonies and foreign postal services, with locations being assigned a specific letter followed by a number, such as A01 used in Kingston, Jamaica, or D22 for Venezuela.\nEarly cancellations were all applied by hand, commonly using hand stamps. Where hand stamps were not available, stamps often were cancelled by marking over the stamp with pen, such as writing an \"x\". Pen cancellations were used in the United States into the 1880s, and in a sense continue to this day, when a postal clerk notices a stamp has escaped cancellation and marks it with a ball point pen or marker.\n\nIn the early period of the issuance of postage stamps in the United States a number of patents were issued for cancelling devices or machines that increased (or were purported to increase) the difficulty of washing off and reusing postage stamps. These methods generally involved the scraping or cutting-away of part of the stamp, or perhaps punching a hole through its middle. (These forms of cancellation must be distinguished from perfins, a series of small holes punched in stamps, typically by private companies as an anti-theft device.)\n\nHigh speed cancellation machines were first used in Boston between 1880–1890 and subsequently throughout the country.\n\nToday, cancellations may either be applied by hand or machine. Hand cancellation is often used when sending unusually shaped mail or formal mail (e.g., wedding invitations) to avoid damage caused by machine cancellation.\n\nPostal meter stamps and similar modern printed to order stamps are not ordinarily cancelled by postal authorities because such stamps bear the date produced and can not readily be re-used.\n\n\nThe United States Postal Service distinguishes between special cancellations which have a caption publicizing an event, and pictorial cancellations, which contain an image of some sort. Special cancellations are essentially a type of slogan cancellations.\nIn the United States, official pictorial cancellations are almost invariably applied at special \"stations\", i.e., post offices existing only for a limited time, usually one day, at special events, although there are frequently other pictorial cancellations that are not officially described as such — they are among what are called special cancellations and are special die-hubs added to machine cancels, which usually contain merely a slogan but sometimes contain a picture.\nThere are a very few exceptions in which a particular post office uses a pictorial cancellation on all its mail. \n\nThe range of allowable subjects is very broad, and may include a variety of commercial tie-ins, such as to movie characters.\n\nCanada Post uses automated cancellations with computer-printed messaging. In this way, the corporation can automatically print promotional messages on each envelope while simultaneously cancelling the piece of mail. Messages change throughout the year, and include seasonal messages (\"Merry Christmas / Joyeux Noel\") and promotional messages (such as Canada Post's web address).\n\nOther post offices such as the Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau also create special pictorial cancellations as they did in 1985 to mark the anniversary of the aircraft Douglas DC-3. A special handstamp was created depicting a Dakota flying \"free\" and not \"boxed in\".\n\nGeneralist stamp collectors usually prefer lightly cancelled stamps which have the postmark on a corner or small portion of the stamp without obscuring the stamp itself, which ordinarily are more valuable than heavily-cancelled stamps. In order to get the postal clerk to cancel the stamps lightly, collectors may rubber-stamp or write \"philatelic mail\" on the envelope.\n\nCancellations may significantly affect the value of the stamps. Many stamps are rarer, and consequently much more expensive, in unused condition, such as the Penny Black, which in 1999, catalogued for $1,900 mint and $110 used. The reverse is true for some stamps, such as the hyperinflation stamps of Germany, which may be worth many times more if genuinely postally used. Where stamps are much more valuable in used condition than unused, it may be advisable to have such stamps expertised to confirm that the cancellation is genuine and contemporary.\n\nSome stamp collectors are interested in the cancellations themselves, on or off cover, of a particular country or issue, or collect a specific type of cancellation, such as fancy cancels. There have been many published studies of the cancellations of many countries, some of which are listed below. Collectors who are interested in the cancellations themselves prefer bold, readable cancellations. Cancellations also are an integral part of the collection of postal history. \n\nHistorically, collectors disliked pen cancels and removed many of them, making the stamp appear unused or to add a fake cancellation. Today, early United States pen cancelled stamps still are worth considerably less than examples with hand stamped cancels.\n\nCollectors generally view modern cancelled-to-order stamps or CTOs as philatelic junk, and they rarely have any significant value. Stamp catalogs commonly state whether their values for used stamps are for CTOs or for postally used examples. For example, the Scott Catalog used value listings for the German Democratic Republic are for CTOs from 1950 through mid-1990, over 2700 stamps.\n\nForgers have not only manufactured stamps for the philatelic market, they have added forged cancellations to those stamps. This was especially common in the late 19th century and early 20th century, when huge numbers of inexpensive stamps were forged for the packet trade.\n\nForged cancellations have also been applied to genuine stamps, in cases where the stamps are worth much more postally used. In addition, where rare cancellations are desired by collectors, those cancellations have also been forged.\n\nCancellations may also be used to prove that certain philatelic items are genuine. For example, forgers have fabricated many supposedly valuable postal covers by adding genuine stamps and forged postal markings to pre-stamp covers. A cover can be shown to be genuine if a genuine cancellation \"ties\" the stamp or stamps to the cover; that is, if a genuine cancellation runs continuously over the stamp and adjacent portion of the envelope, although one still may need to rule out the possibility that the cancellation was added later. Similarly, stamps that were cut in parts and used for a portion of the full value as splits can only be shown to have been so used if a genuine cancel ties the stamp to the cover or piece of cover.\n\nGreat Britain, Ireland & Commonwealth\n\nUnited States\n\nAustria-Hungary\n\nBelgium\n\nCanada\n\nFrance\n\nGerman States\n\nNetherlands\n\nSouth America\n\nElsewhere\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "229459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229459", "title": "Clear-channel station", "text": "Clear-channel station\n\nA clear-channel station is an AM radio station in North America that has the highest protection from interference from other stations, particularly concerning night-time skywave propagation. The system exists to ensure the viability of cross-country or cross-continent radio service, and is enforced through a series of treaties and statutory laws. Now known as Class A stations since 1982, they are occasionally still referred to by their former classifications of Class I-A (the highest classification), Class I-B (the next highest class), or Class I-N (for stations in Alaska too far away to cause interference to the primary clear-channel stations in the lower 48 states). The term \"clear-channel\" is used most often in the context of North America and the Caribbean, where the concept originated.\n\nSince 1941, these stations have been required to maintain at least 10,000 watts of power to retain their status. Nearly all these stations in the United States, Canada and The Bahamas broadcast at 50,000 watts, with several clear-channel stations in Mexico going as high as 150,000 watts and XEW in Mexico City operating at 250,000 watts for over 80 years. (Cuba was originally included in the plan and had several stations given clear-channel status, but Cuba stopped participating after 1959.)\n\nSixty medium wave frequencies were set aside in 1941 under the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) for nighttime use by only one, two or three specific AM stations, covering a wide area via skywave propagation. These frequencies were known as the \"clear channels\", and the stations on them are thus clear-channel stations. NARBA set aside 37 Class I-A frequencies and 27 Class I-B frequencies. The Class I-N stations in Alaska shared those same frequencies. Where only one station was assigned to a clear channel, the treaty provides that it must operate with a nominal power of 50 kilowatts or more. These were for the most part Class I-A. Stations on the other clear channels, with two or more stations, must use between 10 kW and 50 kW, and most often use a directional antenna so as not to interfere with each other. In addition to the frequencies, the treaty also specified the specific locations where stations on Class I-B channels could be built.\n\nSome of the original NARBA signatories, including the United States, Canada and Mexico, have implemented bilateral agreements that supersede NARBA's terms, eliminating among other things the distinction between the two kinds of clear channel: the original \"I-A\" and \"I-B\" classes, and the newer, U.S.-only \"I-N\" class, which are now all included in class A. Classes \"I-A\" and \"I-B\" still mandate a minimum efficiency of 362.10 mV/m/kW at 1 km, whereas Class \"I-N\" is permitted to use the lower Class B minimum efficiency of 281.63 mV/m/kW at 1 km. There exist exceptions, where a former Class B station was elevated to Class A, yet it maintained its previous antenna system, or made only minor changes thereto.\n\nClear-channel stations, unlike all other AM stations in North America, have a \"secondary service area\"; that is, they are entitled to protection from interference to their nighttime skywave signals. Other stations are entitled, at most, to protection from nighttime interference in their \"primary service area\"—that which is covered by their groundwave signal.\n\nMany stations beyond those listed in the treaty have been assigned to operate on a clear channel (and some had been long before NARBA came into effect in 1941). In most cases, those stations operate during the daytime only, so as not to interfere with the primary stations on those channels. Since the early 1980s, many such stations have been permitted to operate at night with such low power as to be deemed not to interfere; these stations are still considered \"daytimers\" and are not entitled to any protection from interference to their nighttime signals. Another group of stations, formerly known as \"class II\" stations, were licensed to operate on the former \"I-B\" clear channels with significant power at night, provided that they use directional antenna systems to minimize radiation towards the primary stations.\n\niHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Communications until September 2014), a San Antonio, Texas-based company that owns over 1000 U.S. radio stations, was originally formed to purchase one clear-channel station, 1200 WOAI in its home city of San Antonio. The company now owns more than a dozen such stations.\n\nFor the U.S., a form of clear channels first appeared in 1922 when the Commerce Department moved stations which had all used three (initially two) frequencies (two for entertainment stations, one for \"weather and crop reports\") onto 52 frequencies. Two were set aside for low-power local and regional stations, while the large stations in major cities each got their own frequency. A few frequencies were used on both the East and West coasts, which were considered far enough apart to limit interference. At that time, large stations were limited to 1000 watts and some licences were revoked.\n\nOn November 11, 1928 the United States implemented General Order 40, which classified each allocation in the AM band as either Local, Regional or Clear. The classification system considered stations in Canada as well. Gradually maximum power was increased to 50,000 watts: additionally there were some short-lived experiments with 250–500 kilowatt \"super-power\" operations. This system was continued in the 1941 NARBA system, although almost all stations shifted broadcast frequencies. The FCC's intent behind licensing 50,000 watt \"clear-channel\" stations was to provide reliable radio service to the thousands of Americans who lived in the vast rural areas of the United States. As a result, these stations usually reached large portions of North America at night. Radio fans often call such stations \"flamethrowers\" or \"blowtorches\" because of their high power.\n\nAs early as the 1930s, debate raged in Washington, D.C., and in the U.S. broadcasting industry over whether continuation of the clear-channel system was justifiable. The licensees of clear-channel stations argued that, without their special status, many rural areas would receive no radio service at all. Rural broadcasters pointed out that most of the clear-channel stations were licensed to serve large cities on the two coasts, which made little sense for a service that was meant to provide radio to the vast rural areas in the middle of the country. The clear-channel licensees requested that the power limit on the \"I-A\" channels in the U.S., set at 50 kW by the FCC, be lifted entirely. They pointed to successful experiments made by WLW in Cincinnati before the war, and in later years successful implementation by state broadcasters in Europe and the Middle East, as evidence that this would work and improve the service received by most Americans. Other broadcasters, particularly in the western states, argued to the contrary; that if the special status of the clear-channel stations was eliminated, \"they\" would be able to build facilities to provide local service to those rural \"dark areas\".\n\nOne of the most outspoken of the small-town broadcasters, Ed Craney of KGIR in Butte, Montana, went so far as to apply to move his station, then on the 1370 kHz regional channel, to a class I-A signal on 660 kHz, asking the FCC to downgrade the NBC New York flagship, WEAF, to make way for the Butte station. The FCC denied Craney's petition.\n\nIn 1941 several existing clear-channel stations applied for power increases to between 500 and 750 kW; dissemination of national defense information is cited as one reason this would be in the public interest. In October 1941 the FCC's engineering department presented a report on a complete reorganization of the clear-channel service; the report considered the possibility of \"some 25 superpower stations of 500,000 watts or more, strategically located to provide maximum service\" (as \"Broadcasting\" described it), and suggested that stations would have to be relocated away from the east and west coasts in such a scenario, as coastal stations waste energy over the oceans. One complication the FCC considered was the \"Wheeler resolution\", passed by the United States Senate in 1938, expressing the view of the Senate that radio stations should be limited to a maximum power of 50 kW.\n\nOne station, KOB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, fought a long legal battle against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and New York's WABC for the right to move from a regional channel to a clear channel, 770 kHz, arguing that the New York signal was so weak in the mountain west that it served no one. KOB eventually won the argument in the late 1960s; it and several other western stations were allowed to move to eastern clear channels. (Western clear channels, such as 680 in San Francisco, had been \"duplicated\" in the eastern states for many years.) These new \"class II-A\" assignments (in places like Boise, Idaho; Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada; Lexington, Nebraska; Casper, Wyoming; Kalispell, Montana; and others) began what would later be called \"the breakdown of the clear channels\". The class I-A station owners' proposal to increase power fifteenfold was not immediately quashed, but the new II-A stations would make it effectively impossible for stations on the duplicated channels to do so, and the owners eventually lost interest. That proposal was finally taken off the FCC's docket in the late 1970s.\n\nOn May 29, 1980 the FCC voted to limit the protection for all clear-channel stations to a 750-mile (1 207 km) radius around the transmitter. Stations on those frequencies outside the area of protection were no longer required to sign off or power down after sundown.\n\nIn 1987 the FCC changed its rules to prohibit applications for new \"class-D\" stations. (Class-D stations have night power between zero and 250 watts, and frequently operate on clear channels.) However, any existing station could voluntarily relinquish nighttime authority, thereby becoming a class-D, and several have done so since the rule change.\n\nDaytimers (also known as daytime-only stations) are AM radio stations that are limited to broadcasting during the daytime only, as their signals would interfere with clear-channel and other radio stations at night, when solar radiation is reduced, and medium wave radio signals can propagate much farther. Such stations are usually supposed to do one of three things: sign off, reduce power (sometimes dramatically, to only a few watts), or switch to another (typically near-by) frequency, such as the Detroit area's WNZK (690 day, 680 night). Their broadcast class is Class D. A number of these stations also broadcast on the internet and have separate streams that air when the station's over-the-air signal has signed-off.\n\nDaytime-only stations first originated in the late 1920s shortly after General Order 40 was imposed. One of the first to do so was WKEN in Kenmore, New York (now WUFO). WKEN proposed the concept to avoid the then-common practice of having to share one frequency between multiple stations; under General Order 40, WKEN would have had to share its frequency with WKBW, and the daytime-only proposal allowed both stations their own frequency. WUFO remains a daytime-only station to the present day.\n\nAs of 2013, daytimers only exist in the United States and Mexico. The last Canadian daytime station, CKOT, signed off on February 17 of that year after converting to the FM band. There were 61 daytimers in Mexico in 2015.\n\nThe following two tables show all of the class-A stations in North America.\n\nFirst is the Canada, Mexico, and contiguous United States table, for the former class I-A and class I-B stations. General Order 40 allocations are in bold.\n\nSecond is the Alaska table, for the former class I-N stations.\n\nUnder the most recent treaty, Mexican Class A stations which previously operated with 50 kW or less (but a minimum of 10 kW nights) may increase power to 100 kW days while retaining their 10 kW night operation. This created some anomalies where stations licensed for 10 kW during all hours could increase power to 100 kW days and 10 kW nights, unless a directional antenna system was installed for nights, in which case the maximum night power was 50 kW. Additionally, one Class B station which had been operating non-directionally with 100 kW days and 50 kW nights was required to reduce power to 50 kW during all hours.\n\nThese allocations have been downgraded rather than transferred to a different station.\n\n"}
{"id": "994191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=994191", "title": "Consent decree", "text": "Consent decree\n\nA consent decree is an agreement or settlement that resolves a dispute between two parties without admission of guilt (in a criminal case) or liability (in a civil case), and most often refers to such a type of settlement in the United States. The plaintiff and the defendant ask the court to enter into their agreement, and the court maintains supervision over the implementation of the decree in monetary exchanges or restructured interactions between parties. It is similar to and sometimes referred to as an antitrust decree, stipulated judgment, settlement agreements, or consent judgment. Consent decrees are frequently used by federal courts to ensure that businesses and industries adhere to regulatory laws in areas such as antitrust law, employment discrimination, and environmental regulation.\n\nThe process of introducing a consent decree begins with negotiation. One of the three happens: a lawsuit is filed and the parties concerned reach an agreement prior to adjudication of the contested issues; a lawsuit is filed and actively contested, and the parties reach an agreement after the court has ruled on some issues; or the parties settle their dispute prior to the filing of a lawsuit and they simultaneously file a lawsuit and request that the court agree to the entry of judgment. The court is meant to turn this agreement into a judicial decree. In many cases, the request for entry of a consent decree prompts judges to sign the documents presented then and there. In some cases, however, such as criminal cases, the judge must make some sort of assessments before the court’s entry of the agreement as a consent decree.\n\nThe usual consent decree is not self-executing. A consent decree is implemented when the parties transform their agreements from paper to reality. The judge who signed the decree may have no involvement or may monitor the implementation. The judge can only step in to assist in enforcement if a party complains to the court that an opponent has failed to perform as agreed. In this case, the offending party would be committed for contempt.\n\nDecrees by consent are more binding than those issued \"in invitum\", or against an unwilling party, which are subject to modification by the same court, and reversal by higher courts. The decree issued by consent cannot be modified, except by consent. If the decree was obtained by means of fraud or given by mistake, it may be set aside by a court. Errors of law or of inferences from the facts may invalidate it completely.\n\nTypically, a consent decree dispenses with the necessity of having proof in court, since by definition the defendant agrees to the order. Thus, the use of a consent decree is not a sentence or admission of guilt. Likewise, the consent decree prevents a finding of facts, so the decree cannot be pleaded as \"res adjudicata\".\n\nBecause judicial decrees are part of government civil enforcement in settlements that two parties typically agree to before litigation is filed, they act as a hybrid between a judicial order and a settlement without a party conceding criminal responsibility.\n\nFrederick Pollock and Frederic Maitland describe how courts during the twelfth century of Medieval Europe used \"fines\" as a form of court orders to settle land disputes among litigants with the punitive power and legitimacy of courts through the use of consent decree. In the United States, 19th and 20th century legal treatises show that consent decrees and the role of the court in the parties' settlement was ambiguous. The 1947 \"Corpus Juris Secundum\" declares that although consent decrees are \"not the judgment of the court,\" they do have the \"force and effect of a judgment.\"\n\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which both went into effect in 1938, lay many of the legal foundations that govern the use of consent decree. Creating space for courts, which are important actors in implementing a consent decree, to enter into a settlement, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gives federal district courts the power to approve class action settlements as long as they are \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" Rule 54(b) defines \"judgment\", which refers to consent decree, and allows the court to \"direct entry of a final judgment\" when multiple parties are involved, and Rule 58 describes the procedure of how parties may enter judgment. Additionally, Rule 60 describes conditions under which parties can be granted \"relief from a judgment or order\" (such as a consent decree). As Rule 48 in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, stipulates that dismissals in criminal cases may not occur without \"leave of court,\" simultaneously, Rule 41 allows, if all the parties agree, the court to dismiss any suit (besides class action suits, shareholder derivative suits, or bankruptcy action). Many of these rules create the space for consent decree by establishing the role of judges within the settlement of two parties.\n\nMany of the early court cases involving consent decree set precedents for the roles that judges would play in the negotiating, approving, interpreting, and modifying a settlement between two parties. The role of the judge in regard to consent decree wavers between \"rubber stamping\" versus applying their own judgments to a proposed settlement. In 1879, \"Pacific Railroad of Missouri v. Ketchum\" bound the court's role in consent decrees to simply supporting to an agreement that parties have already established on their own. In regard to antitrust decrees, the first consent decree used in antitrust regulation under the Sherman Antitrust Act was \"Swift & Co. v. United States\". With \"Swift & Co. v. United States\", the Supreme Court ruled that a consent decree could be modified or terminated only when new developments over time bring out a \"grievous wrong\" in how the ruling of the consent decree affects the parties of the suit. The Supreme Court supported this limited flexibility of consent decrees in \"United States v. Terminal R.R. Ass'n\": \"[A] decree will not be expanded by implication or intendment beyond the meaning of its terms when read in the light of the issues and the purposes for which the suit was brought.\"\n\nIn 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in \"United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.\", that to promote finality, a court's changes to consent a decree should be rare—but the courts can modify a consent decree or frame injunctive relief to ensure the litigation achieves its purpose. Before a judge can enter a consent decree, according to the rulings in \"Firefighters v. City of Cleveland\" and \"Firefighters v. Stotts\" they must have subject-matter jurisdiction, and they cannot modify a consent decree when one of the parties object. The Supreme Court's position on how much authority a judge possesses in regard to influencing how the settlement is agreed upon is conflicting. In \"Firefighters v. City of Cleveland\", the Supreme Court ruled that consent decrees \"have attributes both of contracts and of judicial decrees\", so consent decrees should be treated differently for different purposes. In \"Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail\", the Supreme Court decided that courts could take into account the changing times and circumstances for more flexibility in the administration of consent decrees.\n\nIn regard to litigation in performance rights organizations such as American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and Broadcast Music, Inc. in \"United States v. ASCAP\", which began in 1941, the Department of Justice used consent decrees (which are amended according to the times and technology) to regulate how they issued blanket licenses to ensure that trade is not restrained and that the prices of licenses would not be competitive.\n\nViolations of antitrust law are typically resolved through consent decrees, which began to be more widely used after 1914 with the enactment of the Clayton Antitrust Act. This act began to address the complexities of antitrust economic regulation by recognizing the use of consent decrees as a method for the enforcement of federal antitrust legislation. In amending the antitrust statutes laid out in the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) and its supplement, the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), the Tunney Act further specified how consent decrees could be used by establishing that the courts must demonstrate that consent decrees serve the \"public interest\" in antitrust cases filed by the Justice Department. In regard to antitrust decrees, the first consent decree used in antitrust regulation under the Sherman Antitrust Act was \"Swift & Co. v. United States\" in which the Court used its power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the Chicago meat trust as an unlawful economic monopoly. In \"Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States\", the government used consent decrees to dissolve the horizontal monopoly that John D. Rockefeller had established. Other examples of antitrust consent decrees can be found in a wide range of areas, including their involvement in corporations specializing in technology, the film industry, and the motor vehicle industry.\n\nThe effort to desegregate American public schools began in 1954 with \"Brown v. Board of Education\". This landmark Supreme Court case established that racial segregation of children in public schools was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires that states must not \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" To properly enforce this legislation, the Supreme Court allowed district courts to use desegregation decrees obligating states to actively transition into racially nondiscriminatory school systems, with \"all deliberate speed\". Since the original decree did not include specific ways this could be done, beginning with \"Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education\" in 1971, the Supreme Court specifically defined the objective as eliminating \"all vestiges of state imposed segregation\" within school systems, including the limited use of busing, racial quotas, the creation of magnet schools and judicial placement of new schools, and the redrawing of school attendance zones. To stop judicial intervention in schools and end the consent decree through a court order, districts must demonstrate desegregation within six criteria defined in the \"Green v. County School Board\" ruling—which include, student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities.\n\nConsent decrees have been signed by a number of cities concerning their police departments' use of force policies and practices, including New Orleans, Oakland, Los Angeles—whose consent decree was lifted in 2013—and Albuquerque.\n\nConsent decrees have been used to remedy various social issues that deal with public and private organizations, where a large number of people are often concerned even if they may not be members of either party involved. Examples have included Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and environmental safety provisions.\n\nTitle VII prohibits discrimination by employers on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. Most often, the remedies to workplace discrimination carried out under this Act take place in the form of consent decrees, where employers may have to provide monetary awards or introduce policies and programs that eliminate and prevent future discrimination. These may include decrees that require the creation of new recruitment and hiring procedures to gain a more diverse pool of job applicants, upgrading job and promotion assignment systems, or offering training programs focusing on discrimination and diversity Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was created to be a major advocate and enforcer of the previously mentioned Title VII remedies. In a landmark decision in 1973, the EEOC, Department of Labor and AT&T compromised on a consent decree that phased out discrimination within recruiting, hiring and employment methods in regard to minorities and women. This established a precedent for other large, private U.S companies to avoid litigation and government oversight by creating decrees in cooperation with Title VII.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a civil rights law passed in 1990 that prohibits discrimination and ensures that people with disabilities have equal access to the opportunities and benefits available to the wider American population. Institutions that violate the requirements of the ADA enter consent decrees typically resulting in a payment from the corporation to those wronged, which may serve to discourage future discrimination, in addition to a change in policy to avoid future payouts. Examples of altered practices through the use of a decree have included restructuring building property or the removal of barriers to allow for physical accessibility for all persons, providing supplemental communication tools such as sign language interpreters for those that are hard of hearing, and eliminating discriminatory practices against those that have a disability.\n\nConsent decrees have been used to alter environmental policy, one example being the \"Flannery Decision\", or the Toxics Consent Decree, entered into by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. This decree, signed in 1976, highly restructured the way the EPA dealt with harmful substances by requiring the agency to list and regulate 65 toxic pollutants and to regulate harmful substances on an industry-by-industry basis rather than by singular pollutants. This decree went on to shape the regulations and administration procedures of water policy within the United States, particularly through the Clean Water Act.\n\nScholars find advantages and disadvantages to using the consent decree. In addition, consent decrees can affect those outside of the litigants, such as third parties and public interests.\n\nThe following are advantages of using consent decrees:\n\nIn contrast, the following are disadvantages of using consent decrees:\n\nThe consent decree can impact those outside of the parties, who resolve their disputes with a consent decree, especially in settling institutional reform and antitrust cases. From \"Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail\" and \"Swift & Co. v. United States\", the Supreme Court acknowledges that \"the effects of the decree on third parties and the public interest should be taken into account when determining whether or not a change in fact warrants... the decree.\" There is criticism that \"the antitrust consent decree is an opaque form of government regulation that operates without many of the checks and balances that constrain and shape ordinary regulatory programs.\" So, some argue that the use of consent decrees in antitrust cases and with public institutions can negatively affect third parties and public interests.\n"}
{"id": "13314050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13314050", "title": "Conversation theory", "text": "Conversation theory\n\nConversation theory is a cybernetic and dialectic framework that offers a scientific theory to explain how interactions lead to \"construction of knowledge\", or \"knowing\": wishing to preserve both the dynamic/kinetic quality, and the necessity for there to be a \"knower\". This work was proposed by Gordon Pask in the 1970s.\n\nConversation theory regards social systems as symbolic, language-oriented systems where responses depend on one person's interpretation of another person's behavior, and where meanings are agreed through conversations. But since meanings are agreed, and the agreements can be illusory and transient, scientific research requires stable reference points in human transactions to allow for reproducible results. Pask found these points to be the understandings which arise in the conversations between two participating individuals, and which he defined rigorously.\n\nConversation theory describes interaction between two or more cognitive systems, such as a teacher and a student or distinct perspectives within one individual, and how they engage in a dialog over a given concept and identify differences in how they understand it.\n\nConversation theory came out of the work of Gordon Pask on instructional design and models of individual learning styles. In regard to learning styles, he identified conditions required for concept sharing and described the learning styles \"holist\", \"serialist\", and their optimal mixture \"versatile\". He proposed a rigorous model of analogy relations.\n\nConversation theory as developed by Pask originated from this cybernetics framework and attempts to explain learning in both living organisms and machines. The fundamental idea of the theory was that learning occurs through conversations about a subject matter which serves to make knowledge explicit.\n\nConversations can be conducted at a number of different levels:\n\n\nThrough recursive interactions called \"conversation\" their differences may be reduced until agreement—that is, agreement up to a point which Pask called \"agreement over an understanding\"—may be reached. A residue of the interaction may be captured as an \"entailment mesh\", an organized and publicly available collection of resultant knowledge, itself a major product of the theory as devotees argue they afford many advantages over semantic networks and other, less formalized and non-experimentally based \"representations of knowledge\".\n\nLastly, a formal analogy is shown where the derivations of the concept triples are indicated. The diamond shape denotes analogy and can exist between any three topics because of the shared meanings and differences.\nThe relation of one topic to another by an analogy can also be seen as a restriction on a mapping and a distinction to produce the second topic or concept.\n\nFrom conversation theory, Pask developed what he called a \"Cognitive Reflector\". This is a virtual machine for selecting and executing concepts or topics from an entailment mesh shared by at least a pair of participants. It features an external modelling facility on which agreement between, say, a teacher and pupil may be shown by reproducing public descriptions of behaviour. We see this in essay and report writing or the \"practicals\" of science teaching.\n\nLp was Pask's protolanguage which produced operators like Ap which concurrently executes Con, the concept of a Topic, T, to produce a Description, D. Thus:\n\nAp(Con(T)) => D(T), where => stands for produces.\n\nA succinct account of these operators is presented in Pask Amongst many insights he points out that three indexes are required for concurrent execution, two for parallel and one to designate a serial process. He subsumes this complexity by designating participants A, B, etc.\n\nIn Commentary toward the end of Pask, he states:\n\nIn order to facilitate learning, Pask argued that subject matter should be represented in the form of structures which show what is to be learned. These structures exist in a variety of different levels depending upon the extent of the relationships displayed. The critical method of learning according to Conversation Theory is \"teachback\" in which one person teaches another what they have learned.\n\nPask identified two different types of learning strategies:\n\nThe ideal is the versatile learner who is neither vacuous holist \"globe trotter\" nor serialist who knows little of the context of his work.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48761", "title": "Denazification", "text": "Denazification\n\nDenazification () was an Allied initiative to rid German and Austrian society, culture, press, economy, judiciary, and politics of the National Socialist ideology (Nazism). It was carried out by removing those who had been Nazi Party or SS members from positions of power and influence and by disbanding or rendering impotent the organizations associated with Nazism. The program of denazification was launched after the end of the Second World War and was solidified by the Potsdam Agreement.\n\nThe term \"denazification\" was first coined as a legal term in 1943 in the Pentagon, intended to be applied in a narrow sense with reference to the post-war German legal system. Soon afterward, it took on the more general meaning.\n\nVery soon after the program started, due to the emergence of the Cold War, the western powers and the United States in particular began to lose interest in the program, and it was carried out in an increasingly lenient and lukewarm way until being officially abolished in 1951. The American government soon came to view the program as ineffective and counterproductive. Additionally, the program was hugely unpopular in Germany and was opposed by the new West German government of Konrad Adenauer.\n\nDenazification in Germany was attempted through a series of directives issued by the Allied Control Council, seated in Berlin, beginning in January 1946. \"Denazification directives\" identified specific people and groups and outlined judicial procedures and guidelines for handling them. Though all the occupying forces had agreed on the initiative, the methods used for denazification and the intensity with which they were applied differed between the occupation zones.\n\nThe term \"denazification\" also refers to the removal of the physical symbols of the Nazi regime. For example, in 1957 the West German government re-issued World War II Iron Cross medals, among other decorations, without the swastika in the center.\n\nAbout 8.5 million Germans, or 10% of the population, had been members of the Nazi Party. Nazi-related organizations also had huge memberships, such as the German Labour Front (25 million), the National Socialist People's Welfare organization (17 million), the League of German Women, Hitler Youth, the Doctors' League, and others. It was through the Party and these organizations that the Nazi state was run, involving as many as 45 million Germans in total. In addition, Nazism found significant support among industrialists, who produced weapons or used slave labour, and large landowners, especially the Junkers in Prussia. Denazification after the surrender of Germany was thus an enormous undertaking, fraught with many difficulties.\n\nThe first difficulty was the enormous number of Germans who might have to be first investigated, then penalized if found to have supported the Nazi state to an unacceptable degree. In the early months of denazification there was a great desire to be utterly thorough, to investigate every suspect and hold every supporter of Nazism accountable; however, it turned out that the numbers simply made this goal impractical. It soon became evident, further, that pursuing denazification too scrupulously would make it impossible to create a functioning, economically-efficient democratic society in Germany. Enforcing the strictest sanctions against lesser offenders would prevent too many talented people from participating in the reconstruction process. The Morgenthau Plan had recommended that the Allies create a post-war Germany with all its industrial capacity destroyed, reduced to a level of subsistence farming; however, that plan was soon abandoned as unrealistic and, because of its excessive punitive measures, liable to give rise to German anger and aggressiveness. As time went on, another consideration that moderated the denazification effort in the West was the concern to keep enough good will of the German population to prevent the growth of communism.\n\nThe denazification process was often completely disregarded by both the Soviets and the Western powers for German rocket scientists and other technical experts, who were taken out of Germany to work on projects in the victor's own country or simply seized in order to prevent the other side from taking them. The U.S. took 785 scientists and engineers from Germany to the United States, some of whom formed the backbone of the U.S. space program (see Operation Paperclip).\n\nIn the case of the top-ranking Nazis, such as Göring, Hess, von Ribbentrop, Streicher, and Speer, the initial proposal by the British was to simply arrest them and shoot them, but that course of action was replaced by putting them on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials in order to publicize their crimes while demonstrating that the trials and the sentences were just, especially to the German people. However, the legal foundations of the trials were questioned, and most Germans were not convinced that the trials were anything more than \"victors' justice\".\nMany refugees from Nazism were Germans and Austrians, and some had fought for Britain in the Second World War. Some were transferred into the Intelligence Corps and sent back to Germany and Austria in British uniform. However, German-speakers were small in number in the British zone, which was hampered by the language deficit. Due to its large German-American population, the U.S. authorities were able to bring a larger number of German-speakers to the task of working in the Allied Military Government, although many were poorly trained. They were assigned to all aspects of military administration, the interrogation of POWs, collecting evidence for the War Crimes Investigation Unit and the search for war criminals.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive 1067 directed U.S. Army General Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of denazification. A report of the Institute on Re-education of the Axis Countries in June 1945 recommended: \"Only an inflexible long-term occupation authority will be able to lead the Germans to a fundamental revision of their recent political philosophy.\" The United States military pursued denazification in a zealous, albeit bureaucratic, fashion, especially during the first months of the occupation. It had been agreed among the Allies that denazification would begin by requiring Germans to fill out a questionnaire () about their activities and memberships during the Third Reich. Five categories were established: \"Major Offenders\", \"Offenders\", \"Lesser Offenders\", \"Followers\", and \"Exonerated Persons\". The Americans, unlike the British, French, and Soviets, interpreted this to apply to every German over the age of eighteen in their zone. Eisenhower initially estimated that the denazification process would take 50 years.\n\nWhen the nearly complete list of Nazi Party memberships was turned over to the Allies (by a German anti-Nazi who had rescued it from destruction in April 1945 as American troops advanced on Munich), it became possible to verify claims about participation or non-participation in the Party. The 1.5 million Germans who had joined before Hitler came to power were deemed to be hard-core Nazis.\n\nProgress was slowed by the overwhelming numbers of Germans to be processed, but also by difficulties such as incompatible power systems and power outages, with the Hollerith IBM data machine that held the American vetting list in Paris. As many as 40,000 forms could arrive in a single day to await processing. By December 1945, even though a full 500,000 forms had been processed, there remained a backlog of 4,000,000 forms from POWs and a potential case load of 7,000,000. The \"Fragebögen\" were, of course, filled out in German. The number of Americans working on denazification was inadequate to handle the workload, partly as a result of the demand in the U.S. by families to have soldiers returned home. Replacements were mostly unskilled and poorly trained. In addition, there was too much work to be done to complete the process of denazification by 1947, the year American troops were expected to be completely withdrawn from Europe.\n\nPressure also came from the need to find Germans to run their own country. In January 1946 a directive came from the Control Council entitled \"Removal from Office and from Positions of Responsibility of Nazis and Persons Hostile to Allied Purposes\". One of the punishments for Nazi involvement was to be barred from public office and/or restricted to manual labour or \"simple work\". At the end of 1945, 3.5 million former Nazis awaited classification, many of them barred from work in the meantime. By the end of the winter of 1945–46, 42% of public officials had been dismissed. Malnutrition was widespread, and the economy needed leaders and workers to help clear away debris, rebuild infrastructure, and get foreign exchange to buy food and other essential resources.\n\nAnother concern leading to the Americans relinquishing responsibility for denazification and handing it over to the Germans arose from the fact that many of the American denazifiers were German Jews, former refugees returning to administer justice against the tormentors and killers of their relatives. It was felt, both among Germans and top American officials, that their objectivity might be contaminated by a desire for revenge.\n\nAs a result of these various pressures, and following a 15 January 1946 report of the Military Government decrying the efficiency of denazification, saying, \"The present procedure fails in practice to reach a substantial number of persons who supported or assisted the Nazis\", it was decided to involve Germans in the process. In March 1946 the Law for Liberation from National Socialism and Militarism () came into effect, turning over responsibility for denazification to the Germans. Each zone had a Minister of Denazification. On 1 April 1946, a special law established 545 civilian tribunals under German administration (), with a staff of 22,000 of mostly lay judges, enough, perhaps, to start to work but too many for all the staff themselves to be thoroughly investigated and cleared. They had a case load of 900,000. Several new regulations came into effect in the setting up of the German-run tribunals, including the idea that the aim of denazification was now rehabilitation rather than merely punishment, and that someone whose guilt might meet the formal criteria could also have their specific actions taken into consideration for mitigation. Efficiency thus improved, while rigor declined.\n\nMany people had to fill in a new background form, called a \"Meldebogen\" (replacing the widely disliked \"Fragebogen\"), and were given over to justice under a \"Spruchkammer\", which assigned them to one of five categories:\n\n\nAgain because the caseload was impossibly large, the German tribunals began to look for ways to speed up the process. Unless their crimes were serious, members of the Nazi Party born after 1919 were exempted on the grounds that they had been brainwashed. Disabled veterans were also exempted. To avoid the necessity of a slow trial in open court, which was required for those belonging to the most serious categories, more than 90% of cases were judged not to belong to the serious categories and therefore were dealt with more quickly. More \"efficiencies\" followed. The tribunals accepted statements from other people regarding the accused's involvement in National Socialism. These statements earned the nickname of \"Persilscheine\", after advertisements for the laundry and whitening detergent Persil. There was corruption in the system, with Nazis buying and selling denazification certificates on the black market. Nazis who were found guilty were often punished with fines assessed in Reichsmarks, which had become nearly worthless. In Bavaria the Denazification Minister, Anton Pfeiffer, bridled under the \"victor's justice\", and presided over a system that reinstated 75% of officials the Americans had dismissed and reclassified 60% of senior Nazis. The denazification process lost a great deal of credibility, and there was often local hostility against Germans who helped administer the tribunals.\n\nBy early 1947, the Allies held 90,000 Nazis in detention; another 1,900,000 were forbidden to work as anything but manual labourers.\n\nBy 1948, the Cold War was clearly in progress and the US began to worry more about a threat from the Eastern Bloc rather than the latent Nazism within occupied Germany. The remaining cases were tried through summary proceedings that left insufficient time to thoroughly investigate the accused, so that many of the judgments of this period have questionable judicial value. For example, by 1952 members of the SS like Otto Skorzeny could be declared formally denazified () \"in absentia\" by a German government arbitration board and without any proof that this was true. \n\nThe delicate task of distinguishing those truly complicit in or responsible for Nazi activities from mere \"followers\" made the work of the courts yet more difficult. US President Harry S. Truman alluded to this problem: \"though all Germans might not be guilty for the war, it would be too difficult to try to single out for better treatment those who had nothing to do with the Nazi regime and its crimes.\" Denazification was from then on supervised by special German ministers, like the Social Democrat Gottlob Kamm in Baden-Württemberg, with the support of the US occupation forces.\n\nContemporary American critics of denazification denounced it as a \"counterproductive witch hunt\" and a failure; in 1951 the provisional West German government granted amnesties to lesser offenders and ended the program.\n\nWhile judicial efforts were handed over to German authorities, the US Army continued its efforts to denazify Germany through control of German media. The Information Control Division of the US Army had by July 1946 taken control of 37 German newspapers, six radio stations, 314 theaters, 642 cinemas, 101 magazines, 237 book publishers, and 7,384 book dealers and printers. Its main mission was democratization but part of the agenda was also the prohibition of any criticism of the Allied occupation forces. In addition, on May 13, 1946, the Allied Control Council issued a directive for the confiscation of all media that could contribute to Nazism or militarism. As a consequence a list was drawn up of over 30,000 book titles, ranging from school textbooks to poetry, which were then banned. All copies of books on the list were confiscated and destroyed; the possession of a book on the list was made a punishable offense. All the millions of copies of these books were to be confiscated and destroyed. The representative of the Military Directorate admitted that the order was in principle no different from the Nazi book burnings.\n\nThe censorship in the U.S. zone was regulated by the occupation directive JCS 1067 (valid until July 1947) and in the May 1946 order valid for all zones (rescinded in 1950), Allied Control Authority Order No. 4, \"No. 4 – Confiscation of Literature and Material of a Nazi and Militarist Nature\". All confiscated literature was reduced to pulp instead of burning. It was also directed by Directive No. 30, \"Liquidation of German Military and Nazi Memorials and Museums\". An exception was made for tombstones \"erected at the places where members of regular formations died on the field of battle\".\n\nArtworks were under the same censorship as other media:\n\nThe directives were very broadly interpreted, leading to the destruction of thousands of paintings and thousands more were shipped to deposits in the U.S. Those confiscated paintings still surviving in U.S. custody include for example a painting \"depicting a couple of middle aged women talking in a sunlit street in a small town\". Artists were also restricted in which new art they were allowed to create; \"OMGUS was setting explicit political limits on art and representation\".\n\nThe publication \"Der Ruf\" (\"The Call\") was a popular literary magazine first published in 1945 by Alfred Andersch and edited by Hans Werner Richter. \"Der Ruf\", also called \"Independent Pages of the New Generation\", claimed to have the aim of educating the German people about democracy. In 1947 its publication was blocked by the American forces for being overly critical of occupational government. Richter attempted to print many of the controversial pieces in a volume entitled \"Der Skorpion\" (\"The Scorpion\"). The occupational government blocked publication of \"Der Skorpion\" before it began, saying that the volume was too \"nihilistic\".\n\nPublication of \"Der Ruf\" resumed in 1948 under a new publisher, but \"Der Skorpion\" was blocked and not widely distributed. Unable to publish his works, Richter founded Group 47.\n\nThe Allied costs for occupation were charged to the German people. A newspaper which revealed the charges (including, among other things, thirty thousand bras) was banned by the occupation authorities for revealing this information.\n\nFrom the beginning, denazification in the Soviet zone was considered a critical element of the transformation into a socialist society and was quickly and effectively put into practice. Members of the Nazi Party and its organizations were arrested and put in internment. The NKVD was directly in charge of this process, and oversaw the camps. In 1948, the camps were placed under the same administration as the gulag in the Soviet government. According to official records, 122,600 people were interned. 34,700 of those interned in this process were considered to be Soviet citizens, with the rest being German. This process happened at the same time as the expropriation of large landowners and Junkers, who were also often former Nazi supporters.\n\nBecause part of the intended goal of denazification in the Soviet zone was also the removal of anti-socialist sentiment, the committees in charge of the process were politically skewed. A typical panel would have one member from the Christian Democratic Union, one from the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany, three from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and three from political mass organizations (who were typically also supportive of the Socialist Unity Party). \n\nFormer Nazi officials quickly realized that they would face fewer obstacles and investigations in the zones controlled by the Western Allies. Many of them saw a chance to defect to the West on the pretext of anti-communism. Conditions in the internment camps were terrible, and between 42,000 and 80,000 prisoners died. When the camps were closed in 1950, prisoners were handed over to the East German government.\n\nEven before denazification was officially abandoned in West Germany, East German propaganda frequently portrayed itself as the only true anti-fascist state, and argued that the West German state was simply a continuation of the Nazi regime, employing the same officials that had administered the government during the Nazi dictatorship. These accusations would be vindicated, as during the 1950s many former functionaries of Nazi regime were employed in positions in the West German government. However, East German propaganda also attempted to denounce as Nazis even politicians like Kurt Schumacher, who had been imprisoned by the Nazi regime himself. Such allegations appeared frequently in the official Socialist Unity Party of Germany newspaper, the \"Neues Deutschland\". The riots of 17 June 1953 in Berlin were officially blamed on Nazi \"agents provocateurs\" from West Berlin, who the \"Neues Deutschland\" alleged were then working in collaboration with the Western government with the ultimate aim of restoring Nazi rule throughout Germany. The Berlin Wall was officially called the Anti-Fascist Security Wall () by the East German government.\n\nNot all former Nazis faced judgment. Doing special tasks for the Soviet government could protect Nazi members from prosecution, enabling them to continue working. Having special connections with the occupiers in order to have someone vouch for them could also shield a person from the denazification laws. In particular, the districts of Gera, Erfurt, and Suhl had significant amounts of former Nazi Party members in their government.\n\nThe British prepared a plan from 1942 onwards, assigning a number of quite junior civil servants to head the administration of liberated territory in the rear of the Armies, with draconian powers to remove from their post, in both public and private domains, anyone suspected, usually on behavioural grounds, of harbouring Nazi sympathies. For the British government, the rebuilding of German economic power was more important than the imprisonment of Nazi criminals. Economically hard pressed at home after the war, they did not want the burden of feeding and otherwise administering Germany.\n\nIn October 1945, in order to constitute a working legal system, and given that 90% of German lawyers had been members of the Nazi Party, the British decided that 50% of the German Legal Civil Service could be staffed by \"nominal\" Nazis. Similar pressures caused them to relax the restriction even further in April 1946. In industry, especially in the economically crucial Ruhr area, the British began by being lenient about who owned or operated businesses, turning stricter by autumn of 1945. In order to reduce the power of industrialists, the British expanded the role of trade unions, giving them some decision-making powers.\n\nThey were, however, especially zealous during the early months of occupation in bringing to justice anyone, soldiers or civilians, who committed war crimes against POWs or captured Allied aircrew. In June 1945 an\ninterrogation centre at Bad Nenndorf was opened, where ex-Nazis and suspected communist agents were tortured with beatings, whippings, thumb-screws, cold, starvation, etc. A public scandal ensued but only one person was found guilty of neglect.\n\nThe British to some extent avoided being overwhelmed by the potential numbers of denazification investigations by requiring that no one need fill out the \"Fragebogen\" unless they were applying for an official or responsible position. This difference between American and British policy was decried by the Americans and caused some Nazis to seek shelter in the British zone.\n\nIn January 1946, the British handed over their denazification panels to the Germans.\n\nThe French were less vigorous, for a number of reasons, than the other Western powers, not even using the term \"denazification\", instead calling it \"épuration\" (purification). They did not view it as critical to distinguish Nazis from non-Nazis, since in their eyes Germans were all to blame. At the same time, some French occupational commanders had served in the collaborationist Vichy regime during the war where they had formed friendly relationships with Germans. As a result, in the French zone mere membership in the Nazi party was much less important than in the other zones.\n\nBecause teachers had been strongly Nazified, the French began by removing three-quarters of all teachers from their jobs. However, finding that the schools could not be run without them, they were soon rehired, although subject to easy dismissal. A similar process governed technical experts. The French were the first to turn over the vetting process to Germans, while maintaining French power to reverse any German decision. Overall, the business of denazification in the French zone was considered a \"golden mean between an excessive degree of severity and an inadequate standard of leniency\", laying the groundwork for an enduring reconciliation between France and Germany. In the French zone only thirteen Germans were categorized as \"major offenders\".\n\nIn 2017, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office investigated a German Army Lieutenant known as \"Franco A.\" allegedly a right-wing extremist accused by the authorities to have been involved in a conspiracy to carry out a serious violent acts that endangered state security. Commenting on the case the German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said \"When [Franco A.] master's thesis says that immigration leads to the genetic genocide of Western peoples, then it should be crystal clear to everyone that we are dealing with Nazi ideas\". After her ministry has issued a report on the incidents detailing examples of soldiers performing the Nazi salute and racially abusing service members from minority backgrounds; she stated in April 2017 that the ministry would make significant changes. \n\nIn May 2017, the German Ministry of Defence (\"Bundesministerium der Verteidigung\") halted the publication of an Army (\"Bundeswehr\") songbook that included some songs from the Nazi period such as \"Panzerlied\" and stated that \"As part of the critical and sensitive handling of the content it was recognized that some passages no longer correspond to our values\". Although the ministry denied it stating that the review had been initiated months before, the magazine \"Der Spiegel\" linked this action to the investigation to the Franco A. case.\n\nIn 1965, the National Front of the German Democratic Republic published what became known as the \"Brown Book: War and Nazi Criminals in West Germany: State, Economy, Administration, Army, Justice, Science\". As the title would indicate, the presence of former Gestapo members in the \"Volkspolizei\" and ex-Nazis at all levels of the Socialist Unity Party was not covered. The book, among other things, mentioned 1,800 names of former Nazis who held positions of authority in West Germany. These included 15 ministers and deputy ministers, 100 generals and admirals of the armed forces, 828 senior judges and prosecutors, 245 leading members of the Foreign Ministry, embassies and consulates officials, and 297 senior police officers and Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution officials. The listing was inaccurate; many of the military names had not been Party members, as the armed forces did not permit its officers to join, while many low level Party members in other groups were overlooked altogether. As revealed by BKA official Dieter Senk in 1989, \"today we know that [the] Brown Book didn't contain even approximately all the relevant names ... For example it mentions only 3 names from the BKA\". The book had a controversial impact in West Germany. Reflecting this, a judge ordered the seizure of the volume from the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1967.\n\nThe culture of denazification strongly influenced the parliamentary council charged with drawing up a constitution for those occupation zones that would become West Germany.\n\nThis Constitution (, Basic Law) was completed on May 8, 1949, ratified on May 23, and came into effect the next day. This date effectively marks the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe end of denazification saw the \"ad hoc\" creation initially of the Western Union (not to be confused with the commercial operation of that name) which would be institutionalised as the Western European Union in 1947 and 1955, with a broad socio-economic remit actually implemented in the strict domain of arms control.\n\nThe ideas of collective guilt and collective punishment originated not with the US and British people, but on higher policy levels. Not until late in the war did the U.S. public assign collective responsibility to the German people. The most notable policy document containing elements of collective guilt and collective punishment is JCS 1067 from early 1945. Eventually horrific footage from the concentration camps would serve to harden public opinion and bring it more in line with that of policymakers.\n\nAlready in 1944, prominent U.S. opinion makers had initiated a domestic propaganda campaign (which was to continue until 1948) arguing for a harsh peace for Germany, with a particular aim to end the apparent habit in the U.S. of viewing the Nazis and the German people as separate entities.\n\nStatements made by the British and U.S. governments, both before and immediately after Germany's surrender, indicate that the German nation as a whole was to be held responsible for the actions of the Nazi regime, often using the terms \"collective guilt\" and \"collective responsibility\".\n\nTo that end, as the Allies began their post-war denazification efforts, the Psychological Warfare Division (PWD) of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force undertook a psychological propaganda campaign for the purpose of developing a German sense of collective responsibility.\n\nThe Public Relations and Information Services Control Group of the British Element (CCG/BE) of the Allied Control Commission for Germany began in 1945 to issue directives to officers in charge of producing newspapers and radio broadcasts for the German population to emphasize \"the moral responsibility of all Germans for Nazi crimes\". Similarly, among U.S. authorities, such a sense of collective guilt was \"considered a prerequisite to any long-term education of the German people\".\n\nUsing the German press, which was under Allied control, as well as posters and pamphlets, a program was conducted to acquaint ordinary Germans with what had taken place in the concentration camps. For example, using posters with images of concentration camp victims coupled to text such as \"YOU ARE GUILTY OF THIS!\" or \"These atrocities: your fault!\"\n\nThe introduction text of one pamphlet published in 1945 by the American War Information Unit (Amerikanischen Kriegsinformationsamt) entitled \"Bildbericht aus fünf Konzentrationslagern\" (\"Photo Report from Five Concentration Camps\") contained this explanation of the pamphlet's purpose:\nA number of films showing the concentration camps were made and screened to the German public, such as \"Die Todesmühlen\", released in the U.S. zone in January 1946, and \"Welt im Film No. 5\" in June 1945. A film that was never finished due partly to delays and the existence of the other films was \"Memory of the Camps\". According to Sidney Bernstein, chief of PWD, the object of the film was:\n\nDelays led to the decision that the approach to the film was not as good as other extant films, and the footage and unread script were shelved.\n\nPart of the reason the film was scrapped was that the harsh attitudes toward Germans had changed. Initially the denazification had a more harsh goal. English writer James Stern recounted an example in a German town soon after the German surrender.\n\nImmediately upon the liberation of the concentration camps, many German civilians were forced to see the conditions in the camps, bury rotting corpses and exhume mass graves. In some instances, civilians were also made to provide items for former concentration camp inmates.\n\nThe U.S. conducted opinion surveys in the American zone of occupied Germany. Tony Judt, in his book \"Postwar: a History of Europe since 1945\", extracted and used some of them.\n\nBritish historian Ian Kershaw in his book \"The \"Hitler Myth\": Image and Reality in the Third Reich\" writes about the various surveys carried out at the German population:\n\nHowever, in \"Hitler, Germans, and the \"Jewish Question\"\", Sarah Ann Gordon notes the difficulty of drawing conclusions from the surveys. For example, respondents were given three alternatives from which to choose, as in question 1:\nTo the question of whether an Aryan who marries a Jew should be condemned, 91% responded \"No\". To the question of whether \"All those who ordered the murder of civilians or participated in the murdering should be made to stand trial\", 94% responded \"Yes\".\n\nGordon singles out the question \"Extermination of the Jews and Poles and other non-Aryans was not necessary for the security of the Germans\", which included an implicit double negative to which the response was either yes or no. She concludes that this question was confusingly phrased (given that in the German language the affirmative answer to a question containing a negative statement is \"no\"): \"Some interviewees may have responded 'no' they did not agree with the statement, when they actually did agree that the extermination was not necessary.\" She further highlights the discrepancy between the antisemitic implications of the survey results (such as those later identified by Judt) with the 77% percent of interviewees who responded that actions against Jews were in no way justified.\n\nGordon states that if the 77 percent result is to be believed then an \"overwhelming majority\" of Germans disapproved of extermination, and if the 37 percent result is believed to be correct then over one third of Germans were willing to exterminate Poles and Jews and others for German security. She concludes that the phrasing of the question on German security lowers the confidence in the latter interpretation.\n\nGordon follows this with another survey where interviewees were asked if Nazism was good or bad (53% chose bad) and reasons for their answer. Among the nine possible choices on why it was bad, 21% chose the effects on the German people before the war, while 3–4 percent chose the answer \"race policy, atrocities, pogroms\". However, Gordon highlights the issue that it is difficult to pin down at which point in time respondents became aware of the exterminations, before or after they were interviewed: questionnaire reports indicate that a significant minority had no knowledge until the Nuremberg trials.\n\nShe also notes that when confronted with the exterminations there was an element of denial, disbelief, and confusion. Asked about concentration camps, very few Germans associated them with the Jews, leading to the conclusion that they did not understand how they had been used against the Jews during the war and instead continued to think of them as they were before the war, the place where political opponents to the Nazis were kept. \"This naivete is only understandable if large numbers of Germans were truly ignorant of the existence of these camps\". A British study on the same attitudes concluded that\n\nThose who said National Socialism was a good idea pointed to social welfare plans, the lack of unemployment, the great construction plans of the Nazis ... Nearly all those who thought it a good idea nevertheless rejected Nazi racial theories and disagreed with the inhumanity of the concentration camps and the 'SS'.\n\nSarah Gordon writes that a majority of Germans appeared to approve of nonviolent removal of Jews from civil service and professions and German life. The German public also accepted the Nuremberg laws because they thought they would act as stabilizers and end violence against Jews. The German public had as a result of the Nazi antisemitic propaganda hardened their attitudes between 1935 and 1938 from the originally favorable stance. By 1938, the propaganda had taken effect and antisemitic policies were accepted, provided no violence was involved. Kristallnacht caused German opposition to antisemitism to peak, with the vast majority of Germans rejecting the violence and destruction, and many Germans aiding the Jews.\n\nThe Nazis responded by intimidation in order to discourage opposition, those aiding Jews being victims of large-scale arrests and intimidation. With the start of the war the anti-Semitic minority that approved of restrictions on Jewish domestic activities was growing, but there is no evidence that the general public had any acceptance for labor camps or extermination. As the number of antisemites grew, so too did the number of Germans opposed to racial persecution, and rumors of deportations and shootings in the east led to snowballing criticism of the Nazis. Gordon states that \"one can probably conclude that labor camps, concentration camps, and extermination were opposed by a majority of Germans\".\n\nGordon concludes in her analysis on German public opinion based German SD-reports during the war and the Allied questionnaires during the occupation:\n\nit would appear that a majority of Germans supported elimination of Jews from the civil service; quotas on Jews in professions, academic institutions, and commercial fields; restrictions on intermarriage; and voluntary emigration of Jews. However, the rabid antisemites' demands for violent boycotts, illegal expropriation, destruction of Jewish property, pogroms, deportation, and extermination were probably rejected by a majority of Germans. They apparently wanted to restrict Jewish rights substantially, but not to annihilate Jews.\n\nThe West German political system, as it emerged from the occupation, was increasingly opposed to the Allied denazification policy. As denazification was deemed ineffective and counterproductive by the Americans, they did not oppose the plans of the West German chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, to end the denazification efforts. Adenauer's intention was to switch government policy to reparations and compensation for the victims of Nazi rule (\"Wiedergutmachung\"), stating that the main culprits had been prosecuted. In 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. Officials were allowed to retake jobs in the civil service, with the exception of people assigned to Group I (Major Offenders) and II (Offenders) during the denazification review process.\n\nSeveral amnesty laws were also passed which affected about 792,176 people. Those pardoned included people with six-month sentences, 35,000 people with sentences of up to one year and include more than 3,000 functionaries of the SA, the SS, and the Nazi Party who participated in dragging victims to jails and camps; 20,000 other Nazis sentenced for \"deeds against life\" (presumably murder); 30,000 sentenced for causing bodily injury, and 5,200 who committed \"crimes and misdemeanors in office\". As a result, many people with a former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of Western Germany.\n\nMembership in Nazi organizations is still not an open topic of discussion. In the 1980s former UN Secretary General and President of Austria Kurt Waldheim was confronted with allegations he had lied about his wartime record in the Balkans. \n\nIt was not until 2006 that famous German writer Günter Grass, often viewed as a spokesman of \"the nation's moral conscience\", spoke publicly about the fact that he had been a member of the Waffen SS (even though his involvement appears to have been less than criminal; he was conscripted into the Waffen SS while barely seventeen years old and his duties were strictly military in nature). Statistically it is likely that there are many more Germans of Grass's generation (also called the \"Flakhelfer-Generation\") with biographies similar to his.\n\nJoseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), on the other hand, has been open about his membership at the age of fourteen in Hitler Youth, when his church youth group was forced to merge with them.\n\nIn practice, denazification was not limited to Germany and Austria; in every European country with a vigorous Nazi or Fascist party, measures of denazification were carried out. In France the process was called épuration légale (\"legal cleansing\"). Prisoners of war held in detention in Allied countries were also subject to denazification qualifications before their repatriation.\n\nDenazification was also practised in many countries which came under German occupation, including Belgium, Norway, Greece and Yugoslavia, because satellite regimes had been established in these countries with the support of local collaborators.\n\nIn Greece, for instance, Special Courts of Collaborators were created after 1945 to try former collaborators. The three Greek \"quisling\" prime ministers were convicted and sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Other Greek collaborators after German withdrawal underwent repression and public humiliation, besides being tried (mostly on treason charges). In the context of the emerging Greek Civil War however, most wartime figures from the civil service, the Greek Gendarmerie and the notorious Security Battalions were quickly integrated into the strongly anti-Communist postwar establishment.\n\nAn attempt to ban the swastika across the EU in early 2005 failed after objections from the British government and others. In early 2007, while Germany held the European Union presidency, Berlin proposed that the European Union should follow German Criminal Law and criminalize the denial of the Holocaust and the display of Nazi symbols including the swastika, which is based on the Ban on the Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations Act (see Strafgesetzbuch section 86a). This led to an opposition campaign by Hindu groups across Europe against a ban on the swastika. They pointed out that the swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace. The proposal to ban the swastika was dropped by Berlin from the proposed European Union wide anti-racism laws on 29 January 2007.\n\nIn part inspired by the idea behind denazification, several central and eastern European countries have adopted policies following the revolutions of 1989 aimed at dismantling the legacies of the communist state establishments, culture, and psychology, and to some extent to punish communist perpetrators, referred to as decommunization.\n\n\n"}

Speakers of Dulong are generally in all domains and all ages with positive attitudes. Dulong is closely related to the Rawang language of Myanmar (Burma). Although almost all ethnic Derung people speak the language to some degree, most are multilingual, also speaking Burmese, Lisu, and Mandarin Chinese except for a few very elderly people\n\nDulong is also called: Taron, Kiu, Qui, Kiutze, Qiuzi, Kiupa, Kiao, Metu, Melam, Tamalu, Tukiumu, Qiu, Nung, Nu-tzŭ.\n\nDulong belongs to the Nungish language family of the Central Tibeto-Burman branch of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. The other two languages in the same family are Anong and Rawang.\n\nDulong/Rawang is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken on both sides of the China/Myanmar (Burma) border just south and east of Tibet. Within Myanmar, the people who speak the Dulong language (possibly up to 100,000 people) live in northern Kachin State, particularly along the Mae Hka ('Nmai Hka) and Mach Hka (Mali Hka) River valleys. In the past, they had been called 'Hkanung' or 'Nung', and have often been considered to be a subgroup of the Kachm (Jinghpaw). Around 2000, speakers of this language in Myanmar have begun a movement to use the name /rəwɑŋ/ (spelled 'Rvwang' in the Rawang orthographies) to represent all of its speakers. The speakers in China, though, continue to use the name 'Dulong'.\n\nThere are 14,000 (2,000 census) people speaking in two dialects: 8,500 in Nu River dialect, and 5,500 in Dulong River dialect. The locations of Dulong are Yunnan province (Gongshan Dulong-Nu autonomous county), Xizang Autonomous Region (Gongshan Dulong-Nu autonomous county west to Chayu (Zayü) county), Gongshan county, Bingzhongluo, and Tibet (Chayu county, Chawalong district). In the past, the Dulong River was known as the Kiu (Qiu) river, and the Dulong people were known as the Kiu (Qiu), Kiutze (Qiuzi), Kiupa, or Kiao.\n\nDulong has two dialects: Dulong River (Central Dulongjiang, Derung River, Northern Dulongjiang, Southern Dulongjiang), and Nu River (Nujiang Dulong). Dialects reportedly inherently intelligible (Thurgood and LaPolla 2003). Other possible dialect names are Melam, Metu, Tamalu, and Tukiumu.\n\nDulong has twenty-four initial consonants at six points of articulation, plus the consonant clusters /pr, br, mr, kr, xr, gr, pl, bl, ml, kl, gl/ in initial position; only the consonants /p, t, ʔ, k, n, m, ŋ, r, l/ occur in final position.\n\nDulong has seven vowels, /i, ε, ə, ɑ, ɔ, ɯ, u/, and three diphthongs, /əi, ɑi, ɯi/, which only appear in open syllables.\n\nDulong has 3 tones: high level, high falling, and low falling. In the Dulong language, tone has the role of differentiating the meaning of a few words, with about 8% words (out of about 4000) completely relying on tones to distinguish them.\n\nWords can be formed by prefixation, suffixation, or compounding. Word classes include nouns, defined by the ability to appear with a numeral classifier; verbs, defined by the ability to appear with negation and the person and tense marking; postpositions, which are enclitic to NPs, numerals, and classifiers. Adjectives are a subset of stative verbs for which reduplication means intensification or adverbialization rather than the perfective aspect (reduplication with nouns has a distributive meaning, ‘every’). Adjectives can be used as predicates or can appear nominalized in a copula clause.\n\nLexical similarity: 74% with Matwang dialect of Rawang.\n\nSimons, Gary F. and Charles D.

He was born in San Sebastian, Spain on March 17, 1703 and died in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany on September 21, 1772. His father was an Irish merchant, who had settled in the Basque city.\n\nAt 14, he and his brother Daniel joined the Society of Jesus. In 1736 he went on to profess the Society's vows in San Sebastian. He became a professor of philosophy at the University of Santiago and professor of theology at the universities of Salamanca and Valladolid. He eventually returned to the Jesuit community in his hometown. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 he went into exile along with his companions, dying a few years later, on September 21, 1772, in Florence at 69 years of age. In his hometown, San Sebastian, a square, the Father Meagher/Aita Meagher Plaza was dedicated to his memory in 1994.\n\nBesides teaching, Father Meagher also produced prose and poetry. There is evidence that he produced various writings but most of them were lost following the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 which involved the loss of many of the company's writings. Among his works the following are cited:\n\n\n\n\nFather Meagher managed to fill a small gap in the history of Basque literature, having preserved the language in several poems written in Basque. These managed to retain its popularity and were transcribed in songbooks and magazines during the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth.\n\nIt is told that Meagher, recovering from an illness, was taking wine as a prescription to relieve his ailments. Meagher was able to recover from the illness and, grateful for the relief he had found in wine, wrote some verses in which he praised the qualities of wine. Meagher's poems in Basque all deal with the same theme, for this they can be described as Basque poetry:\n"}
{"id": "41408839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41408839", "title": "Dump months", "text": "Dump months\n\nThe dump months are what the film community calls the two periods of the year when there are lowered commercial and critical expectations for most new releases from American filmmakers and distributors. Domestic audiences during these periods are smaller than the rest of the year, so no tentpole movies are released. January and February are usually most commonly described this way, with August and September sometimes included. Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at test screenings, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly horror), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which has fewer entertainment options outside the home.\n\nSeveral factors combine to create the dump months, most of them circumstances particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of year in which the distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterward, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.\n\nThe dump months evolved over the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major releases followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like \"The Kid\", \"Shadow of a Doubt\" and \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is \"The Silence of the Lambs\", a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, \"Dirty Dancing\" and \"Fatal Attraction\" became hits following releases in August and September respectively.\n\nFilms released during the dump months have not always been consigned to cinematic oblivion. Some, like \"Tremors\" and \"Office Space\", have become cult classics. Starting with \"Cloverfield\", some 21st-century dump-months releases have managed to exceed $100 million on box office receipts. The similar success of low-budget horror films like \"The Devil Inside\" and \"Mama\" in the early 2010s has prompted studios to release films in that genre at times of the year other than Halloween and the dump months.\n\nThe term \"dump months\" comes from the belief that studios use the time periods in question as a \"dumping ground\" for movies they are contractually obligated to release but believe to have limited commercial prospects at best. \"The big studios would never in a million years use this phrase\", Dade Hayes, coauthor of \"Open Wide: How Hollywood Box Office Became A National Obsession\", told \"Newsday\" in August 2017. \"[B]ut they do view [these times of year] as a dumping ground.\"\n\nCritics and journalists have no such reservations. \"The first months of the year are known as the 'dump months' in Hollywood,\" wrote \"Vegas Seven\" critic Una LaMarche in early 2013, a period characterized by \"movies that studios dislike, and want to release with little fanfare.\" Likewise, Paul Shirey at JoBlo.com dismisses September as \"one of the most worthless months at the box office.\"\n\nThe earliest use of the term to turn up in a Google search is a 2007 article in the British newspaper \"The Guardian\".\n\"In the US, January is 'dump month' at the movies,\" critic Jonathan Bernstein wrote. \"The films no studios believe in or care about ... suddenly become the sole choice available to regular filmgoers hungry for fresh fare.\" Use of the term became more common in the early 2010s.\n\nWhile both dump-month periods immediately follow periods of greater movie attendance when event movies expected to be critical and/or commercial successes are released, and periods of greater consumer spending generally there are also reasons specific to both periods that further dampen movie attendance to limit the expected box office returns to the extent that movies with strong potential will be scheduled for other times of year.\n\nThe main impediment to the release of highly anticipated or high-quality films in January and February is the calendar of the two major film awards, the Golden Globe Awards (January) and the Academy Awards, or \"Oscars\" (late February or early March), which overlap with those months. The winter weather also adds uncertainty to estimates of potential box office. Two holidays during the time provide some slight relief; however, they are offset by the distraction of Super Bowl weekend, which depresses spending on movies. The combined gross for all January releases 2002–2012 has averaged $387 million; for February it is $615 million. By comparison December, with its holiday releases, averages $1.2 billion.\n\nSpending is low to begin with since many consumers are cutting back and repaying debts incurred during the preceding holiday season, as well as having less free time, Jeremy Kirk of Firstshowing.net, when asked to explain the dearth of good films in January, notes that moviegoers are returning to their work and school routines during the month. C. Robert Cargill of Ain't It Cool News adds that only those over 35, \"who have savings accounts and weren't tapped out by Christmas,\" can afford to go to the movies regularly then. He attributes the early-year success of \"Taken\" and its sequels to that market, as well as that of many of Clint Eastwood's recent films, to that older market.\n\nThe website \"Box Office Mojo\", which publishes reports on film grosses, divides the movie year into five seasons. It defines the winter season as lasting from the first day after New Year's week or weekend ends through the Thursday before the first Friday in March. The site's data go back to 1982, and in every year the winter season has had the lowest box office grosses. The weakest winter was 1983, when \"The Entity\"'s $13 million take led the way to a total of $93.4 million in domestic grosses for all movies released during that season. On the other end, 2012 had the strongest winter, at $1.24 billion, topped by \"Safe House\", which took in $124 million.\n\nAt the end of the year comes the holiday movie season, when the studios release both tentpole movies, such as the latest installments in popular franchises that are expected to be highly successful and \"Oscar bait\" movies that are seen as likely to earn critical praise and, more importantly, nominations for major awards such as the Golden Globes and Oscars, the industry's most prestigious. Those nominations are then used to promote the film. But while the former nominations are announced in December with the awards themselves given in early January, the Academy Award nominations are announced \"after\" the Golden Globes, and the actual awards are not given until late February leaving most of the first two months of the year as Oscar season: a period during which any Golden Globes received as well as Oscar nominations can be used to promote the film to audiences, while studios lobby Academy members to vote for their nominees.\n\nTo be eligible for award consideration, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requires that a film be shown in a theater in Los Angeles County, California, for at least seven consecutive days during which it is advertised in print media. Studios hoping to position a film for some nominations usually satisfy that minimum requirement, then ease them into wide release from then until the nominations and/or awards ceremony. The flexibility this marketing strategy requires means that screens be available, and studios limit their releases of new films during this time to that end. As critic Ty Burr explained in a 2013 \"New York Times Magazine\" article on the mediocrity of new releases in the first month of the year: \"[T]he studios ... know our attention is elsewhere.\"\n\nNew films shown publicly anywhere for the first time after January 1 themselves are ineligible for Oscars until the following year, by which time they will likely have been forgotten by critics, audiences and voters. \"The Silence of the Lambs\", winner of the 1991 Academy Award for Best Picture, is a rare exception, as the only film in the post-studio era released in the first two months of its year to go on to win that Oscar. Burr calls it \"the grand exception to the January Movies Will Never Amount to Anything rule,\" and finds that only one other classic of the late 20th century, \"Dr. Strangelove\", was a January release.\n\nTheaters will also still be running any holiday-season hits even if they had not been nominated for awards, further reducing the screens available for new movies. Ray Subers, an editor at \"Box Office Mojo\", says there are two types of January moviegoer that keep December releases on screens throughout the months. \"Discerning adult audiences\", he told \"The Atlantic\" in 2012, spend the month congregating to those films on critics' lists for the best of the year they have not yet gotten to see, while \"the general moviegoers are seeing the event films of December.\"\n\nDuring January and February winter storms become more likely than they are in December. While they do not affect the entire U.S., the Northeast and Midwest are particularly prone to them, along with most neighboring areas of Canada. This includes many major metropolitan areas, and movie markets, in both countries.\n\nWhen winter storms hit, bringing with them combinations of precipitation that making driving difficult and sometimes dangerous, moviegoers often prefer to stay home. Non-essential travel is officially discouraged, and in severe enough weather all non-emergency driving can be banned in some areas until the situation improves. In anticipation of the February 2013 nor'easter, which struck on the month's first weekend, three large chains closed down many of their theaters in the Northeast.\n\nIndustry analysts feared that the storm could seriously impact the box office prospects of two films opening that weekend, \"Identity Thief\" and \"Side Effects\", both of which were seen as having potential to do better than most winter movies. While it afterwards appeared that the two films were not seriously affected, and did better than expected, with \"Identity Thief\" even winning the weekend, despite generally poor reviews and word of mouth, with $36 million in receipts, overall box office was down 45% from the same weekend the previous year. \"Side Effects\" finished a distant third with a quarter of \"Identity Thief\"'s take. The clearest sign of the storm's effect, according to \"Box Office Mojo\", was the 35% drop in earnings for \"Silver Linings Playbook\", then in wide release after several Oscar nominations.\n\nWhile holiday weekends in the US generally increase film audiences and thus attract major releases throughout the year, the two that occur during these months—Martin Luther King Day in January and Presidents' Day in February—offer only a modest prospect for improvement. The most lucrative take by any movie on Martin Luther King Day weekend is $107.2 million by \"American Sniper\" in 2015, its first weekend in wide release; the previous best opening weekend was \"Ride Along\" the previous year, taking in $41.5 million ($48.6 million if the entire three-day holiday weekend is counted).\n\nPresidents' Day benefits by its proximity to Valentine's Day (which, as it is always February 14, is often a weekday), which offers the studios enough chance of a payoff, usually from romantic comedies and other \"chick flicks\" marketed towards women as date movies. \"[Some years] it's been six straight weeks of dreck until\" that holiday, says Cargill. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", the 2015 adaptation of the bestselling erotic novel, took in $93 million on its opening weekend, the largest take for a Presidents' Day weekend until \"Deadpool\" broke that record the year later. \"Valentine's Day\", the 2010 romantic comedy with a large ensemble cast, is third with $63.1 million. Third among opening weekends is \"Ghost Rider\", which took in $52 million in 2007; the best performance by a previously released film on President's Day weekend is the $62.4 million take by \"The Lego Movie\", a week after its release in 2014. In 2018, the superhero film, \"Black Panther\" set a new record for that holiday weekend with $235 million In addition to the consistent popularity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, the critical praise and the holiday weekend, Marvel Studios took advantage of the fact that despite the month's supposed poor reputation for audience interest, it is also Black History Month, a cultural event that made it an ideal time to release a film with such obvious African themes.\n\nAny boost movie grosses get from those two holidays, however, is offset by what typically comes between them. The Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League, has been in recent years played on either the last Sunday of January or the first one of February. It is accompanied by heavy media attention and frequent gatherings all over the country to watch the game on television, accompanied with food and beverages purchased with money that might otherwise be spent on movie tickets. \"Does the Super Bowl affect ticket sales?\" asks Scott Gwin at Cinemablend. \"The answer, of course, is yes. In fact, there's a decent chance Budweiser spends more on advertising that Sunday than America does in theaters.\"\n\nThe most successful film to open during Super Bowl weekend is the 2008 concert film \"\", which took in $31.1 million, almost half the total it would earn during a released limited to just that weekend and the following week. In a close second is \"Dear John\", grossing $30.5 million in 2010, for the strongest Super Bowl weekend opening for a conventional release. Both films had strong appeal to female moviegoers, an audience more receptive to moviegoing on a weekend dominated by a sporting event. The 2008 action film \"Taken\", which Cargill noted for its success in appealing to an older audience, took in $24.7 million on its opening weekend on its way to total receipts of over $100 million, making it a distant third.\n\n\"As we enter the dog days of summer, we get the summer movie season dregs as well,\" wrote PopMatters editor Bill Gibron, anticipating August 2013. The year's other dump period straddles summer and fall, and does not lend itself to being as clearly delineated as the winter dump months. In the past, it was usually considered to include all of August and September, and in some years still may. But, in years with many major summer movies, some may open on the first or second weekend of August to avoid competing with other such movies, such as \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", the first-ever August release by Marvel Studios, which took in $94 million on the first weekend of that month in 2014. It was the most successful August opening weekend, and it became one of the year's top-grossing films.\n\nBy the end of the summer seasonal jobs end, just as with the winter dump months, and moviegoers under the age of 24, who make up 41% of the audience, a larger share than their overall portion of the population, begin to return to school. Tuition payments, and retailers' back-to-school sales further cut into movie grosses; Huntington Bank's annual Backpack Index found in 2017 that costs for school supplies and activity fees, not including taxes or clothing, ranged from $662 for elementary-school students to almost $1,500 for those in high school.\n\n\"The prevailing wisdom is that people don't go to the movies in August\" due to family vacations (on which Americans spend almost $2,000 a year, on average), summer camp, among other factors, \"Vulture\" complained as it pondered another potentially dreary month in 2008. While an August release can open as successfully as a film earlier in the summer, \"[i]t just doesn't have the ability to run five or six weeks so there's a scramble for June and July,\" Ted Mundorff, head of Landmark Theatres, told the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" in 2014. The type of films that interest younger audiences in the early summer, he elaborates, do not do well after Labor Day.\n\nIt is the month's last two weekends that are more universally seen as the beginning of the late-summer dump months, when only forgettable films are likely to be released, with occasional exceptions like \"Dirty Dancing\", which went on to make $63 million domestically from its release in late August 1987, and spawn several sequels and a franchise.\n\nAt the end of August is the annual American celebration of Labor Day, the only holiday weekend during this period. Of all the year's holiday weekends it is reliably the weakest in terms of movie box office, with the top grosser for the weekend being the 2007 Rob Zombie-directed reimagining of \"Halloween\", at $30.5 million. \"The Sixth Sense\", then in its fourth week, is a close second after pulling in $29 million in 1999; in a distant second for opening weekends is yet another horror film, 2012's \"The Possession\" with $21.1 million.\n\nOnce September begins, younger moviegoers are preoccupied with starting the school year and thus less likely to go to the movies on weeknights than they were in summertime. As with the winter months, football also has an impact at the box office as not only NFL teams but college and high school teams resume play, all on weekends. \"[W]e are left with a series of movies competing for box office scraps in a month when Hollywood assumes no one goes to the movies,\" says a Yahoo critic.\n\nSome September movies have triumphed critically and commercially. In 1987, \"Fatal Attraction\", which opened in wide release on September 18 not only succeeded at the box office, staying in theaters through June of the next year and garnering six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Twelve years later, in 1999, the similarly successful \"American Beauty\", which had been in limited release through September before going wide in October, won that award and four others.\n\nSeptember's counterpart to Sundance, the Toronto International Film Festival, is held at the end of the month. The film community's attention is focused on the Canadian city. Critics gather to see potential Oscar contenders among the many independent films on the program and studio executives look to line up distribution deals with the same prize in mind. Some of the best are released within a week or so, ending the September dump period.\n\nIn past years, October also was when eagerly anticipated horror films reached screens, to capitalize on the approach of Halloween at the end of the month. However, this began to change in the 2000s due to the way series such as the \"Saw\" and \"Paranormal Activity\" films dominated that period, prompting distributors of other horror films to consider releasing them during the winter dump months instead. In 2012 Paramount enjoyed huge success with the unheralded \"The Devil Inside\", released right after New Year's Day despite a strongly negative critical and audience reaction; the next year \"Mama\" was received enthusiastically by critics and filmgoers when it came out on Martin Luther King Day weekend after being rescheduled from the previous October to avoid going up against \"Sinister\" and \"Paranormal Activity 4\". Only one major horror film, the third adaptation of Stephen King's \"Carrie\", was released in October 2013, and it underperformed. \"At your local multiplex, the spirit of Halloween is, sadly, dead,\" Matt Barone wrote in \"Complex\". \"Horror's now too big of a business for major studios to care much about October.\"\n\nThe dump months' obstacles are reflected in their box office totals, particularly the success of movies opening during those months. January's strongest domestic opening weekend ever was the $90 million \"American Sniper\" took in when it went into wide release on Martin Luther King Day weekend in 2015. The best opening weekend for a movie seeing screens for the first time in January was the $42 million pulled in by \"Ride Along\" the year before; it is the lowest best opening weekend gross for any month. September's best was the $48 million that \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" took in following its 2015 release, until the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's \"It\" eclipsed it with $123 million, August and February are fourth and fifth, respectively, with \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" at $94 million and \"Deadpool\" at $132 million respectively (the all-time champion is December, reflecting \"\"' massive $248 million it made during its 2015 opening weekend).\n\nIn January 2010, \"Metacritic\" editor Jason Dietz undertook a statistical analysis of whether films released in that month were, as perceived, inferior. He compared the site's aggregate scores, based on critical and audience consensus, for films released in January, February, and March from 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released in the first month of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.\n\nIt did not seem to Dietz as if there was any relationship between critical praise and audience enthusiasm for January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical \"Teacher's Pet\", was a commercial failure, as was 2001's \"The Pledge\". \"Cloverfield\", the third entry, was a success, and behind it \"Freedom Writers\" had ridden its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however \"How She Move\" had flopped that same year.\n\nConversely, some of the successful January releases did not meet with critical acclaim. \"Taken\" had been highly successful at the end of the month in 2009 despite reviews that ranged across the spectrum. And two weeks before that film's release, the universally panned comedy \"\" had opened strong on its way to a total take over $150 million.\n\nContemplating the offerings for January 2013, Adam Raymond at \"Vulture\" undertook a ranking of a quarter-century of Januarys based on scores at Rotten Tomatoes (RT), another review aggregator. He averaged the ratings for all films released in a particular January, with the best and worst scores noted. By this method the best and worst Januarys were both in the earliest years for which the site kept scores. \"[T]his could be more a result of the fact that far fewer movies used to be released then, so it took less to sway the average,\" Raymond noted.\n\nThe best January was also the first, 1987, whose 79% average was led by Woody Allen's acclaimed \"Radio Days\". At 95%, it was also the best-rated January film during the survey period. That month's lowest-rated new release, \"Outrageous Fortune\", still managed a 50% rating, better than the average for all but one of the other years.\n\nAt the other end was January 1989, where the 26% achieved by \"Gleaming the Cube\" and the 0% awarded to \"DeepStar Six\" bracketed a 16% average. Five other January films joined it at the bottom of the scale. It was recognized as a nadir among Januarys even at the time. In a contemporary essay in \"The New York Times\" after the month had concluded, an exasperated Janet Maslin presciently noted that \"the January that has just ended really looks like one for the record books.\"\n\nAmong the 21st-century Januarys, 2011 did the best at 39%, led by \"The Way Back\"'s 75%. The worst was 2003, when \"Final Destination 2\" led the pack to a 23% average with its score of 47%. \"Kangaroo Jack\" brought up the rear at 8%.\n\nLooking ahead to the movies of February 2014, Chris Kirk and Kim Thompson at \"Slate\" argued that February's movies were statistically the worst of any month. Their evidence was the average RT ratings for all movies for each month between 2000 and 2013. February's averaged 45%, three points lower than January and September and four below August. February also had the worst month in the entire sample period, with the 2001 releases from that month coming in at 31%; 2010 and 2012 tied for the best February at 54%.\n\nNo comparable analysis has ever been done on films released during the late-summer dump months. At the end of July 2008, \"Vulture\" again greeted the coming month with two posts on the drop in movie quality historically associated with the month, and its theories for what might explain that. One was a history of the previous 15 Augusts, with movies released in each month subjectively rated as \"halfway-decent\" or \"lousy\". It concluded that over that time there had been 169 lousy movies, and 26 halfway-decent ones. \"That's 11.2 movies per August that make you want to claw your eyes out.\"\n\nMost of the Augusts in the time period in question had one or two \"halfway-decent\" movies, with the other 9–11 movies discarded as \"lousy\". The exceptions were the consecutive years 1998–99. The former was regarded as the worst August, with no halfway-decent movies and all its releases (\"The Avengers\", \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" and \"\", among others) considered lousy. But in August 1999, there were five halfway-decent films: \"The Sixth Sense\", \"The Thomas Crown Affair\", \"The Iron Giant\", \"Dick\" and \"Bowfinger\".\n\nAccording to Burr, from the earliest days of the studio system major releases had largely followed the same calendar modern audiences would recognize, clustered during spring, summer, and the end-of-year holidays. \"Yet January was still in the mix,\" he observes. \"Silent-era Charlie Chaplin hits like \"The Kid\" (1921) and \"The Circus\" (1928), the Garbo/John Gilbert melodrama \"Flesh and the Devil\" (1927) and Josef von Sternberg's \"Last Command\" (1928) all came out during the first month of the year.\"\n\nThe best decade for January movies, Burr writes, may well have been the 1940s. It began with what he suggests was best January in cinema history. \"The Grapes of Wrath\", \"His Girl Friday\" and \"The Shop Around the Corner\", all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as \"Sullivan's Travels\", \"Shadow of a Doubt\" and \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\".\n\nA few months after \"Treasure\"'s release, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in \"United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.\", holding that it was a violation of antitrust law for the studios to own theater chains as well. This has historically been seen as the beginning of the end of the studio system. Burr found that after it, with movies having less of a guaranteed box office since an adequate theatrical run was no longer a certainty, \"release patterns began to clump more formally around big weekends, warmer weather and national holidays.\"\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the studios discovered the summer blockbuster via the success of \"Jaws\" and \"Star Wars\". In the following decade the rise of independent producers dedicated to quality such as Merchant Ivory and Harvey Weinstein made the October–December the year's other highlight. But those two concentrations left the post-holiday winter and late summer as the lows that followed the highs. By the 2010s, Burr said, \"August is death by ennui. And January is suicide.\" Similarly, \"The A.V. Club\" had noted at the same time, \"over the past few decades, the American movie schedule has calcified ... January and February are when studios dump their discards, the movies they have low hopes for and want to disavow.\"\n\nProducer Daniel Melnick, whose \"Altered States\" was moved up a month into the 1980 Christmas season by the studio over his objections, complained about this in an interview at the time. \"I would rather go at a time when there are fewer people attending movies and offer them pictures they want to see, rather than to divide a larger audience with ten other desirable films ... [A]s an industry we have very often shown the instinct of lemmings ... We're all convinced that people go to the movies primarily at Christmas time, so we release our big pictures then ...\"\n\nBy the end of that decade critics had taken notice as well. After January 1989, the month that \"Vulture\" would 24 years later find to be the movies' worst January ever, \"New York Times\" critic Janet Maslin had had enough. Her idea of \"movie hell\" she said, included among other indignities having to watch only January releases. \"It's well known that January films have a character that is, let us say, distinctive ... What is it that leads film distributors to regard January as just the right resting place for so many flukes, black sheep, wild cards and also-rans?\" She allowed that recent years had allowed some good films, such as \"Radio Days\" and \"El Norte\", to get attention they might not have in other months of the year. However, that January had had as one its major releases \"The January Man\", a thriller she characterized as aptly titled, despite not even being the worst the month had to offer (that dubious honor, she suggested, went to \"Deepstar Six\").\n\nDespite the critical and commercial success of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" in 1991, Burr qualified it as an exception that proved the rule. First, it had been released at the very end of January; and second, it had only gone into wide release two weeks later. Such a strategy is typical of January, Burr writes. \"[It']s a studio's way of gritting its teeth and ripping off the Band-Aid.\"\n\nSome observers have suggested that studios and distributors' insistence on seasonal patterns of release is counterproductive. In a 2015 \"New Yorker\" article, James Surowiecki suggested that the lack of moveigoers' interest during the dump months may result from audiences' lowered expectations rather than any external factors: \"[I]f you release blockbusters in July and dogs in January, no wonder people go to the movies more often in July.\"\n\nSurowiecki cited a 2002 study by Stanford economist Liran Einav, who analyzed 15 years of ticket sales and found that while there is indeed a seasonal fluctuation in demand, it is not significant enough to validate the prevalent patterns of release; instead it seemed to him that distributors are responding to \"the observed pattern of sales and \"not\" ... the estimated underlying demand.\" The cyclical variations in revenue, he found, result primarily from the clustering of highly anticipated releases during winter holiday season and the summertime.\n\nA 2010 economic study of North American film release date patterns by two French economists, Manuel Cartier and Sébastien Liarte, agreed with Einav that the \"temporal agglomeration\" of potential blockbuster movies was not driven by realistic understanding of annual demand patterns. Instead, the authors came to believe that it was more socially driven, \"normative mimicry whose end is to respect the beliefs, habits and norms of the [industry].\" Exposing movies released at those times to films that could compete most effectively with them, they concluded, resulted in less overall profit for the studios than they might earn otherwise.\n\nIndustry insiders do not disagree with this assessment; in 2013, Viacom's then-chief executive officer, Philippe Dauman, said publicly that the clustering of tentpole releases was keeping those films from making all the money they could if they were not in such close competition. Ten years earlier, Tom Ortenberg, then head of distribution for Lionsgate Films, told \"The New York Times Magazine\" that \"there is never a bad time to release a good film—and there is never a good time to release a bad film.\"\n\nBut Surowiecki noted that Cartier and Liarte's conclusions that social factors within the industry played a part i the continuation of the release cycles that result in the dump months, due to the many uncertainties involved in producing and distributing a major motion picture and studio executives' desire to avoid blame for a big-budget film's commercial failure. \"If you open a blockbuster on Memorial Day and it fails, no one is going to blame you for your release strategy\", Einav, who in his paper likened this phenomenon to the maxim on Wall Street that no one ever gets fired for recommending investors buy shares of IBM, told him. \"If you open a potential blockbuster in February and it fails you're going to be on the hook.\"\n\nIn 2013, John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), criticized the dump months (among several other studio practices) at CinemaCon, the annual gathering of film exhibitors hosted by NATO. The theaters had come off a first quarter where receipts had been down 12% from the first quarter of 2012. He faulted the studios for their insufficiently diverse offerings in 2013 as compared to the first quarter of the year before, which he connected to the dump-months phenomenon. \"Any month can produce a $100 million movie,\" he said in his speech. \"In 2012, distributors spread their movies over the calendar, and we had a record year.\"\n\nResponding later, in an indieWIRE panel discussion hosted by Anne Thompson, Universal Studios chairman Adam Fogelson agreed in principle with Fithian, saying \"there are very few reasons other than historical behavior why almost any film can't work on almost any weekend ...\" he said. He pointed to the 2005 success of \"White Noise\" on the first weekend of January as having opened that time up to similar low-budget horror films.\n\nHowever, he called the belief among some exhibitors that the theaters' slump was attributable to a plethora of R-rated films saved for January, a criticism repeated by Fithian, \"simplistic.\" The problem was the movies in question, not their ratings. \"Django Unchained\", he insisted, would have been a hit regardless of the month it opened. \"It happens to be about the movies,\" Fogelson said. \"People tend to, if not forget, minimize how complicated this is.\"\n\nSurowiecki credits another Universal executive, former distribution chief Nikki Rocco, for livening up the dump months. She, he wrote, believed that people would go see a movie at any time of year if it was good enough, and that that could make lesser movies hits if they came out at less competitive times of year. Not only did Rocco move apparent summer releases like 1999's \"The Mummy\" to the beginning of May, she also found success for the studio in August with \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" and scheduled \"Ride Along\", \"Identity Thief\" and \"Safe House\" for what wound up being successful runs following January release dates. Surowiecki compared her to Billy Beane. former general manager of Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics, who likewise found a way for a smaller, less wealthy team to compete at the highest levels by using analytics to identify undervalued assets.\n\nCritics and movie fans have observed that studios and other distributors have leaned on particular types of movies, or particular genres, to get them through the dump months. Some of them overlap:\n\nNot all films released in the dump months were originally intended for that period, however. Movies that failed to live up to studios' hopes for a competitive summer release often come out in the winter. \"Vegas Seven\"'s Una LaMarche pointed at the beginning of 2013 to the then-upcoming \"\" as such a film. \"If [it] were any good,\" she wrote, \"it would be coming out in June.\" It indeed fared poorly in the U.S., but better abroad.\n\nShe also suspected that \"Broken City\", another upcoming release that starred Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Mark Wahlberg, had been consigned to a January release due to adverse reactions from test audiences, and correctly anticipated the failure of the ensemble comedy \"Movie 43\" for the same reason. For his part, Meslow points to \"Season of the Witch\", a $40 million horror film starring Nicolas Cage which failed to recoup even that amount, and \"Untraceable\" as emblematic of that kind of big-budget bust buried during dump months. \"The marketing plan for a film like this is often just a formal wake, the last stop before a film's reincarnation as generic product for the on-demand/DVD/streaming after-markets,\" says Burr in his \"Times Magazine\" piece.\n\nOthers that were not originally intended for the dump months get shifted there anyway not because they are bad but because the studios cannot figure out how to market them or are not sure they will succeed. C. Robert Cargill, a former critic for Ain't It Cool News who scripted the successful 2012 horror film \"Sinister\", points to \"Chronicle\", which had a surprisingly strong opening on Super Bowl weekend earlier that year, an example.\n\nSimilarly, LaMarche points to two other types of movies difficult to market to large audiences. \"Winter can be a boon to little movies with niche audiences,\" she writes, pointing to Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, \"Quartet\", which received a limited U.S. release in January 2013, and \"Struck by Lightning\", released at the same time. Movies that also blend genres or defy such categorization, such as the zombie–human \"Romeo and Juliet\" retelling, \"Warm Bodies\", or the limited-release Charlie Sheen comedy \"A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\", are also ideal for their dump-months release time frame.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" had the most successful August opening weekend ever, until 2016's \"Suicide Squad\". It went on to become the highest grossing August release ever as well as 2014's top-grossing film domestically. These accomplishments led industry observers to reconsider whether they should be so dismissive of August, a trend that had been building even before that year. Cary Carling noted afterwards in the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" that recent Augusts had seen a number of critical and commercial successes, not only franchise movies such as \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" and \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" but films that appealed to adult audiences such as \"Blue Jasmine\", \"The Help\", and the James Brown biopic \"Get on Up\", whose $14 million opening weekend against \"Guardians\" \"met expectations.\"\n\n\"[Is] the summer movie season ... expanding out from its traditional boundaries?\" Jordan Smith asked before the month began on \"Hollywood.com\". He noted that some big-budget movies released in the late spring and early summer of recent years, like \"After Earth\", \"White House Down\", \"R.I.P.D.\" and \"The Lone Ranger\", had struggled at the box office against similar competition. He believed a \"point of saturation\" had been reached, with too many of those movies being released in the early summer. But \"audiences are proving that they'll line up at any time of the year to watch Captain America save the day.\"\n\nDave Farger of Fandango.com believes moviegoers are already adapting. When a film like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" comes out at the time of summer it does, \"[it] feels like an event, regardless of the month.\" He sees it as similar to what has happened to the TV schedule, where both broadcast and cable networks have begun airing new scripted shows during the summer, which was once relegated to reruns due to small audiences. \n\nHopes for more success in late August are dependent, however, on new releases during the month. In 2017, with only two new studio films in wide release that August, the last weekend of the month yielded the worst box office results in 16 years, with all films taking in only $65 million, led by \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\", at $10.1 million in receipts, for the second straight week. Around $1.7 million of the total came from \"Wonder Woman\", rereleased to promote its upcoming home media debut.\n\nOne genre regularly mentioned in connection with the dump months is horror. Once a staple of the periods, yet frequently limited to them, recent successes during the dump months have actually led studios to reevaluate this scheduling limitation and release horror movies at other times of the year. \"It seems this time of the year has become the 'other October.'\" said Brian Salisbury of Hollywood.com at the end of February 2013. LaMarche attributes this to winter's \"cold, dark landscape.\"\n\nCritically praised and commercially successful horror films such as 2008's \"Cloverfield\", which had the best January opening weekend for six years until \"Ride Along\", and 2013's January champion \"Mama\", have done well by the dump months. But other horror movies have still succeeded in the face of critical condemnation, starting with \"White Noise\" in 2005. As a result, \"the only new release is usually one crappy horror movie,\" on the year's first weekend, says Will Goss of Film.com.\n\nIn reviewing 2016's \"The Forest\", David Ehrlich of \"Slate\" took note of its release at that time of year. \"[A]nybody with access to a calendar already knows that \"The Forest\" is bad,\" he wrote. \"[A]t this point, that's less of a presumption than it is a tradition.\" In that vein, playing on the movie's Japanese setting, he likened it to the supposed ancient custom of \"ubasute\" in that country, by which elderly people who could no longer care for themselves were purposely abandoned on mountainsides.\n\nIn 2012, \"The Devil Inside\", a low-budget found footage horror film following in the steps of \"Cloverfield\", opened the weekend after New Year's Day. Critics, for whom it had not been screened, reviewed it harshly if and when they did see it, and audiences reacted angrily to the film's abrupt ending, which directed them to a website for more information. Yet, as Cargill notes, its success was proof that even on that low-potential weekend, a disengaged audience will \"throw money at a terrible movie if it looks like it's good.\" The film's opening weekend take of $33.7 million ranks in the top ten for January. \"The Devil Inside\" went on to make over $50 million domestically and almost that much abroad to break $100 million in total receipts.\n\nThe success of both films outside of October, usually the month when studios released their quality horror films to capitalize on Halloween's approach, has actually led studios to rethink that approach and release horror films at other times of year. During the 2000s October, and the weekend before Halloween, had come to be dominated by the \"Saw\" and \"Paranormal Activity\" franchises. \"You would never come up against them because you would be killed,\" recalls Rock Alvarez, producer of \"A Haunted House 2\".\n\nFor that reason, \"Mama\" was rescheduled from October 2012 to the following January. In October 2013, Paramount decided to delay the release of \"\" from the weekend before Halloween to March 2014, and replaced it not with another horror offering but the comedy \"\", leaving the month with only one highly anticipated horror film, the third adaptation of Stephen King's \"Carrie\".\n\nTiffany Smith of Fandango.com's House of Screams says studios are finding holidays with horror associations elsewhere in the year, like Friday the 13th, regardless of season. \"\" had actually opened well on that weekend in September. \"That weekend actually played as a bigger movie weekend than Halloween is this year,\" she told \"USA Today\". In July, \"The Conjuring\" had also done well amidst the summer movies. \"A lot of people are moving [horror movies] everywhere,\" said \"Mama\" producer Guillermo del Toro.\n\nSome movie critics have called on the studios to change their release schedules and improve the quality of new films during the dump months. Paul Shirey of JoBlo.com calls on the studios start releasing better films then. \"Rather than saving them to win statues, why not put them out to reap some box office and fill an otherwise dead month with something worth seeing?\"\n\nTy Burr suggested that in January 2013 that no new movies should be released in January. Instead, \"studios would have to rerelease their most underrated entertainments from the previous year for a second chance.\" He gave \"The Cabin in the Woods\" or \"Chronicle\", itself a January release in 2012, as examples of such films. Failing that happening, he wrote that he was using home media to catch up on older films.\n\nOther critics have tried to look for worthwhile, overlooked films amid the dump-months releases, which do exist, Vegas Seven's Una LaMarche assures readers. In January 2013, \"The Onion\"'s \"A.V. Club\" compiled a list of such overlooked dump months films. It includes many that have since become cult classics, like the 1991 Kevin Bacon horror film \"Tremors\", 1999's \"Office Space\" and 2000's \"Boiler Room\", all released in late February. They also recommend the January 1993 release \"Matinee\", starring John Goodman as legendary gimmick-using film producer William Castle, and \"The Pledge\", a January 2001 film starring Jack Nicholson. \"It is Sean Penn's best film as director, an uncompromising depiction of faith and devotion curdled into something monstrous.\"\n\nOne critic, Matt Singer of \"indieWIRE\", said in January 2013 that he has \"started to look at January with anticipation rather than dread.\" He argues that even the month's bad movies are bad in their own way. Unlike failed summer blockbusters, which have \"way too much money riding on [them] to be anything but mediocre and boring,\" January movies are often spectacular in their failure since the studios do not expect them to do well. \"Why throw good money after bad?\" he asks rhetorically. \"Just cut your losses and let the thing really suck.\" Such benign neglect, he suggests, led to \"The Devil Inside\", \"so intensely stupid it's almost brilliant—and entirely entertaining.\" He likened January movies to trainwrecks, while bad movies in June were more like \"controlled demolitions.\" \"Cloverfield\", he asserted, had begun reversing the trend of forgettable January movies. In more recent years he had been impressed by \"The Grey\" and \"Mama.\"\n\n\"While it's easy to complain about a stretch of so-so movies,\" wrote Matt Patches at Hollywood.com as 2012 began, \"the twist is we should really be \"thanking\" the studios for catering to niche audiences all month.\" For most viewers, it is a chance to catch up on the major awards contenders released in December. But studios and the filmgoers who have already seen those two films can benefit from creative risk-taking by filmmakers. He points to \"Cloverfield\" as one such gamble that succeeded. Smaller film distributors also take advantage of the dump months to bring little-seen but highly praised films like \"Kill List\" to wider audiences via home-media releases.\n\nScott Mendelson at \"Forbes\" said in January 2014 that only critics in large markets have reason to complain during the dump months. \"For the rest\" he claimed \"January is in fact a deluge of high quality movies\" owing to the combination of awards contenders reaching the mass market for the first time, the possibility for unusual successes among the new releases, and overlooked films from the previous year reaching home markets. In that last category, he highly recommended the August 2013 release \"Short Term 12\".\n\nUntil 2010, the Chinese film industry also experienced sluggish domestic ticket sales during January and February, when that country celebrates the traditional New Year, or today the Spring Festival. That year, James Cameron's \"Avatar\" earned US$16 million in one week during that period, leading Chinese filmmakers to reconsider whether audiences were as disinterested in going to theaters at that time of year than they had long believed. They began to make movies that might succeed during this period, realizing that the country's recent economic growth had given people more leisure time.\n\nSince then, that period has become more profitable. Most of the successful films have been domestic productions—no Hollywood production has been released in China during the Spring Festival since \"Frozen\" in 2014. A Chinese critic told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that she believes Hollywood deliberately refrains from releasing its major films in her country during this time since they now know the market will be saturated with high-profile domestic films, much as China itself informally excludes foreign-made films from the summer months.\n\nIn February 2018 the Spring Festival period set new box office records for China. It had its highest-grossing week ever, at (US$890 billion); its highest single-day gross (US$200 million), and its highest attendance ever, with 30 million going to theaters at some point during the week in mid-month. \"Monster Hunt 2\" set the country's opening weekend record with receipts of (US$86 million).\n"}

One of the drivers for floodplain restoration is the EU Water Framework Directive. Early floodplain restoration schemes were undertaken in the mid-1990s in the Rheinvorland-Süd on the Upper Rhine, the Bourret on the Garonne, and as part of the Long Eau project in England. Ongoing schemes in 2007 include Lenzen on the Elbe, La Basse on the Seine and the Parrett Catchment Project in England. On the Elbe River near Lenzen (Brandenburg) 420 hectares of floodplain were restored in order to prevent a recurrence of the Elbe floods of 2002. A total of 20 floodplain restoration projects on the Elbe River were envisaged after the 2002 floods, but only two have been implemented as of 2009 according to the environmental group .\n\nIn the United States examples of floodplain restoration can be found in the catchment area of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, in the Emiquon Preserve on the Illinois River, in Charlotte, North Carolina and along the Baraboo River in Wisconsin.\n\n"}

Born in Palamós, Girona, he travelled through Europe and stayed for a long time in Paris. He was involved in \"Joventut\" (1900–1906), the best \"modernisme\" review of Catalonia. During World War I, he fought with the French army.\n\nVallès wrote \"Homes Artificials\" (\"Artificial Men\") which is the first short science fiction novel in the canon of Catalan literature. It was originally published in 1912, by Biblioteca Joventut in Barcelona. In this novel, the protagonist Doctor Pericart wants to obtain a new society, unsocialized and perfect. Transformed into a demigod, he creates a group of individualized androids, which will be the seeds of the new society.\n\nIn 1914, he was in Paris with his first wife, where he was organizing en International Convention of Esperanto. When that very year the 1914-1918 war broke out, he enlisted as an infantry soldier and took part at the first battles against the German army.\nLater on, as he could read and write the Morse alphabet, he was transferred to Communications between detachments of the French Army. It was during this period that, as a war correspondent of the daily paper \"El Diluvio\" he wrote a series of articles in Spanish about how was life in the trenches.\nWhen he returned to Barcelona, he was appointed Staff editor of that newspaper, which was favourable to a federal system for Spain.\nWhen in 1941 the fascist armies entered into Barcelona, they closed \"El Diluvio\", because Franco considered Federalism to be an offense. Consequently, Frederic Pujulà Vallès was sent to prison, together with the owner of the paper and the owner's two sons.\nFrederic Pujulà received the death penalty, which was two weeks later conmuted to twenty years and one day.\nAt the end, he was set free two years and two months since he was imprisoned.\n\nVallès died in Bargemon, France, in 1962.\n\n\n\n"}

The goal of this \"Human Interference Task Force\" was to find a way to reduce the likelihood of future humans unintentionally intruding on radioactive waste isolation systems.\n\nSpecifically, the task force was to research ways to prevent future access to the planned, but stalled, deep geological nuclear repository project of Yucca Mountain.\n\nWhen atomic or fusion bombs are detonated in a war, or nuclear power plants are used in times of peace, an unnaturally high amount of radioactive waste is produced. This material will threaten human life and health for thousands of years. Consequently, nuclear technology necessitates the creation of a secure means of terminal storage for such materials for an unusually long time period.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no method available to continuously provide the necessary knowledge about the location of nuclear waste over thousands of years. The culture of earlier centuries becomes incomprehensible when it is not translated into new languages every few generations. National institutions do not exist longer than a few hundred years. Even religions are not older than a few millennia and do not typically hand down scientific knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, the necessary length of storage is disputed among specialists. One work group in Germany concluded that nuclear waste must be separated from the biosphere up to one million years – about 30,000 human generations. Earlier assumptions were based on a period of 10,000 years, which seems to be too short given the half-life of certain radioactive isotopes (e.g. Plutonium-239 at 24,000 years).\n\nThe written historical tradition of humanity, in contrast, is only about 5000 years. Warnings in cuneiform script could be interpreted by some specialists, but others, such as the writing of the Indus Valley civilization, are already illegible after a few thousand years.\n\nThree parts of any communication about nuclear waste must be conveyed to posterity:\n\nTo determine how to convey these three things, the \"\"Zeitschrift für Semiotik\" (Tübingen, Germany) issued a poll in 1982 and 1983 asking how a message might be communicated for a duration of 10,000 years. The poll asked the following question: \"How would it be possible to inform our descendants for the next 10,000 years about the storage locations and dangers of radioactive waste?\" \"leading to the following answers.\n\nThe linguist Thomas Sebeok was a member of the Bechtel working group. Building on earlier suggestions made by Alvin Weinberg and Arsen Darnay he proposed the creation of an \"atomic priesthood\", a panel of experts where members would be replaced through nominations by a council. Similar to the Catholic church - which has preserved and authorized its message for over 2000 years — the \"atomic priesthood\" would have to preserve the knowledge about locations and dangers of radioactive waste by creating rituals and myths. The priesthood would indicate off-limits areas and the consequences of disobedience.\n\nThis approach has a number of critical problems:\n\nPolish science-fiction author Stanisław Lem proposed the creation of artificial satellites that would transmit information from their orbit to Earth for millennia. He also described a biological coding of DNA in a mathematical sense, which would reproduce itself automatically. \"Information Plants\" would only grow near a terminal storage site and would inform humans about the dangers. The DNA of the so-called atomic flowers would contain the necessary data about both the location and its contents.\n\nLem acknowledged the problem with his idea that humans would be unlikely to know the meaning of atomic flowers 10,000 years later, and thus unlikely to decode their DNA in a search for information.\n\nFrench author Françoise Bastide and the Italian semiotician Paolo Fabbri proposed the breeding of so called \"radiation cats\" or \"ray cats\". Cats have a long history of cohabitation with humans, and this approach assumes that their domestication will continue indefinitely. These radiation cats would change significantly in color when they came near radioactive emissions and serve as living indicators of danger. In order to transport the message, the importance of the cats would need to be set in the collective awareness through fairy tales and myths. Those fairy tales and myths in turn could be transmitted through poetry, music and painting. The story of this original project was depicted in the 2016 short documentary \"The Ray Cat Solution\".\n\nVilmos Voigt from Loránd-Eötvös university (Budapest) proposed the installation of warning signs in the most important global languages in a concentric pattern around the terminal storage location. After a certain time span new signs with translations would be installed, but the old signs would not be removed. Newer signs would be posted farther away from the location, thus the warning would be understandable as languages change and it would be possible to understand the older languages through the translation.\n\nPhysicist Emil Kowalski from Baden, Switzerland proposed that terminal storage locations be constructed in such a way that future generations could reach them only with a high technical ability. The probability of an unwanted breach would then become extremely small. Furthermore, cultures able to perform such excavations and drillings would most certainly be able to detect radioactive material and be aware of its dangers.\n\n"}

{"id": "27162678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27162678", "title": "Jejemon", "text": "Jejemon\n\nJejemon () is a popular culture phenomenon in the Philippines. According to Urban Dictionary, a Jejemon is a person \"who has managed to subvert the English language to the point of incomprehensibility.\" The \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" describes Jejemons as a \"new breed of hipster who have developed not only their own language and written text but also their own subculture and fashion.\"\n\nThe origins of short-handed typing was through the short messaging service, in which each text message sent by a cellphone is limited to 160 characters, evident in popular phone models in the early 2000s such as Nokia 5110. As a result, an \"SMS language\" developed in which words were shortened in order to fit the 160-character limit. However, some jejemons are not really \"conserving\" characters; instead, they are lengthening their message. On April 14, 2010, on a Pinoy Tumblr, a post about vice presidential candidate Jejomar Binay indicated that he was the Jejemon's preferred vice presidential candidate, complete with a fake poster with him called as \"Makki Autors\". Later the use of word \"jejemon\" to refer to such people made rounds in various Filipino internet message boards.\n\nThe word Jejemon is a portmanteau of the Japanese animated series, Pokémon, and \"hehe\" is an expression of laughter.\n\nSuch short-handed language is not limited to Filipinos: Thais use \"5555\" to denote \"hahahaha,\" since the number 5 in Thai language is pronounced as \"ha.\"\n\nThe Jejemons are said to be the new \"jologs\", a term used for Filipinos of the lower income class. The parameters of being classified as a Jejemon are still unclear, and how the different \"levels\" of \"Jejemonism\" are reached, although there are named levels such as \"mild,\" \"moderate\" and \"severe\" or \"terminal.\"\n\nThe sociolect of the Jejemons, called \"Jejenese\", is derived from English, Filipino and their code-switched variant, Taglish. It has its own, albeit unofficial, orthography, known as \"Jejebet\", which uses the Filipino variant of the Roman alphabet, Arabic numerals and other special characters. Words are created by rearranging letters in a word, alternating capitalization, over-usage of the letters H, X or Z. Superfluous as well as the presence of silent letters characterize its spelling convention. It has similarities with Leetspeak, primarily the alphanumeric nature of its writing.\n\nIT and information security experts have found a certain usefulness of \"jejetyping\" in the creation of strong passwords for user logins.\n\nSeveral Facebook fan pages were created both in support and against the group. Celebrities such as Alessandra de Rossi, Ces Drilon, and Lourd de Veyra have condemned the wholesale ridicule of the subculture. Due to the sudden existence of jejemons, 'Jejebusters' were created, a group of internet grammar vigilantes, typically Filipinos, dedicating their internet lives towards the eradication of jejetyping and jejemon existence.\n\nYouTube videos were also uploaded parodying the Jejemons, connecting them to the 2010 election campaign. Edited television advertisements of Nacionalista Party proclaiming their disdain, and an edited photograph of Gilberto Teodoro with him holding a sign saying that the Jejemons should be \"brought back to elementary school\" went viral. In 2010, the Filipino GMA Network broadcast the situational comedy \"JejeMom\", headlined by Eugene Domingo.\n\nAs part of the pre-school year clean-up of schools for the upcoming 2010–11 school year, the Department of Education (DepEd) strongly discourages students from using Jejemon spelling and grammar, especially in text messaging. Communicating with others using Jejemon \"language\" is said to cause deterioration of young Filipino students’ language skills.\n\nFrom early 2013 onwards, with the rise of smartphones which began to overtake feature phones in terms of sales in the country, the phenomenon seems to have made a gradual decline in mainstream popularity. Some social media accounts use such spellings to this date, but most of them are used for sarcasm particularly by . The term \"jejemon\" would gradually shift definition to a pejorative term to describe a stereotype of poorly educated young people wearing hip-hop clothing, roughly similar to the British slang term chav for sportswear. As of 2017, the Jejemon are also called \"hypebeasts\" and are recognizable for wearing counterfeit skateboarding or car culture-related brands.\n"}

He was also a scholar in Sanskrit as well and a court poet (\"Aasthaana kavi\") in the Hoysala Court.\n\nKesiraja was born in a literary family, comprising several well-known Kannada writers. His father, Mallikarjuna (C. 1245 CE), was a Kannada poet and brother-in-law of the epic writer Janna. Kesiraja was also the grandson on his mother's side of another noted poet, Śankara (Sumanōbana), who was priest of the Yadava capital and poet laureate to Hoysala King Narasimha I. In some of his works, Kesiraja has referred to himself as \"Kesava\".\n\n\"Shabdamanidarpana\" (), (\"Jewel-mirror of Grammar\") was authored by Kesiraja in 1260 CE. This work remains a comprehensive, authoritative work on Kannada grammar. The rules mentioned therein were penned in \"kanda\" metre and followed a \"vrutti\" style (illustrative commentary by the author himself). Though Kesiraja followed the model of Sanskrit grammar of the Katantra school, and that of earlier writings on Kannada grammar, his work has an originality of its own.\n\nThe text of \"Shabdamanidarpana\" begins with poetry ehalting earlier generations of writer who are cited by Kesiraja as authoritative examples:\n\nAn attempt at vocabulary building is provided in several parts of the work. There is a list of verbal roots and words containing ḷ and ḹ sounds. There is also a chapter called \"PrayŌgasāra\" where Kesiraja has quoted a number of rare words along with their meanings.\n\nKesiraja had a passion for grammar, which is evident from his writings through his work \"Shabdamanidarpana\".\nApart from his extant grammar \"Shabdamanidarpana\", Kesiraja authored several other writings in Kannada, though they are deemed lost:\n\n"}

{"id": "161684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161684", "title": "Language isolate", "text": "Language isolate\n\nA language isolate, in the absolute sense, is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical (or \"genetic\") relationship with other languages, one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common with any other language. Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language. Commonly cited examples include Ainu, Basque, Korean, Sumerian, and Elamite, though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages.\n\nSome sources use the term \"language isolate\" to indicate a branch of a larger family with only one surviving member. For instance, Albanian, Armenian and Greek are commonly called Indo-European isolates. While part of the Indo-European family, they do not belong to any established branch (such as the Romance, Indo-Iranian, Celtic, Slavic or Germanic branches), but instead form independent branches. Similarly, within the Romance languages, Sardinian is a relative isolate. However, without a qualifier, \"isolate\" is understood to be in the absolute sense of having no demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language.\n\nSome languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families. This happened with Japanese (now included in the Japonic family along with Ryukyuan languages such as Okinawan) and Georgian (now the most dominant or standard of the Kartvelian languages of the Caucasus). The Etruscan language of Italy has long been considered an isolate, but some have proposed that it is related to the so-called Tyrsenian languages, an extinct family of closely related ancient languages proposed by Helmut Rix (1998), including the Rhaetian, formerly spoken in the central Alps, and the Lemnian language, formerly spoken on the Greek island of Lemnos. The Japonic and Kartvelian families are widely accepted by linguists, but since the ancient family that includes Etruscan has not received a similar level of acceptance, Etruscan is still included in the list of language isolates.\n\nLanguage isolates may be seen as a special case of unclassified languages that remain unclassified even after extensive efforts. If such efforts eventually do prove fruitful, a language previously considered an isolate may no longer be considered one, as happened with the Yanyuwa language of northern Australia, which has been placed in the Pama–Nyungan family. Since linguists do not always agree on whether a genetic relationship has been demonstrated, it is often disputed whether a language is an isolate or not.\n\nThe term \"genetic relationship\" is meant in the genealogical sense of historical linguistics, which groups most languages spoken in the world today into a relatively small number of families, according to reconstructed descent from common ancestral languages. A \"genetic relationship\" is a connection between languages, like similarities in vocabulary or grammar, that can be attributed to a common ancestral proto-language that diverged into multiple languages or branches. For example, English is related to other Indo-European languages and Mandarin Chinese is related to other Sino-Tibetan languages. By this criterion, each language isolate constitutes a family of its own, which explains the exceptional interest that these languages have received from linguists.\n\nIt is possible that all natural languages spoken in the world today are related by direct or indirect descent from a single ancestral tongue. The established language families would then be only the upper branches of the genealogical tree of all languages, or, equally, lower progeny of a parent tongue. For this reason, language isolates have been the object of numerous studies seeking to uncover their genealogy. For instance, Basque has been compared with every living and extinct Eurasian language family known, from Sumerian to Kartvelian, without conclusive results.\n\nThere are some situations in which a language with no ancestor might arise. This frequently happens with sign languages, most famously in the case of Nicaraguan Sign Language, where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language. Similarly, if deaf parents were to raise a group of hearing children who have no contact with others until adulthood, they might develop an oral language among themselves and keep using it later, teaching it to their children, and so on. Eventually, it could develop into the full-fledged language of a population. With unsigned languages, this is not very likely to occur at any one time but, over the tens of thousands of years of human prehistory, the likelihood of this occurring at least a few times increases. There are also creole languages and constructed languages such as Esperanto, which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population; however, they do take elements from existing languages.\n\nCaution is required when speaking of extinct languages as isolates. Despite their great age, Sumerian and Elamite can be safely classified as isolates, as the languages are well enough known that, if modern relatives existed, they would be recognizably related .\n\nHowever, many extinct languages are very poorly attested, and the fact that they cannot be linked to other languages may be a reflection of our poor knowledge of them. Etruscan, for example, is sometimes claimed to be Indo-European. Although most historical linguists believe this is unlikely, it is not yet possible to resolve the issue. Hattic, Gutian, Hurrian, Mannean and Kassite are also believed to be isolates by mainstream majority, but their status is disputed by a minority of linguists. Similar situations pertain to many extinct isolates of the Americas such as Beothuk and Cayuse. A language thought to be an isolate may turn out to be relatable to other languages once enough material is recovered, but material is unlikely to be recovered if a language was not documented in writing.\n\nA number of sign languages have arisen independently, without any ancestral language, and thus are true language isolates. The most famous of these is the Nicaraguan Sign Language, a well documented case of what has happened in schools for the deaf in many countries. In Tanzania, for example, there are seven schools for the deaf, each with its own sign language with no known connection to any other language. Sign languages have also developed outside schools, in communities with high incidences of deafness, such as Kata Kolok in Bali, the Adamorobe Sign Language in Ghana, the Urubu Sign Language in Brazil, several Mayan sign languages, and half a dozen sign languages of the hill tribes in Thailand including the Ban Khor Sign Language.\n\nStudies are also being conducted on Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL) in an isolated village in Israel. The language was developed in isolation for over 75 years by both deaf and hearing people within the village.\n\nThese and more are all presumed isolates or small local families, because many deaf communities are made up of people whose hearing parents do not use sign language, and have manifestly, as shown by the language itself, not borrowed their sign language from other deaf communities during the recorded history of these languages.\n\nBelow is a list of known language isolates, arranged by continent, along with notes on possible relations to other languages or language families.\n\nWith few exceptions, all of Africa’s languages have been gathered into four major phyla: Afroasiatic, Niger–Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan. However, the genetic unity of some language families, like Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan, is questionable, and so there may be many more language families and isolates than currently accepted. Data for several African languages, like Kwadi and Kwisi, are not sufficient for classification. In addition, Jalaa, Shabo, Laal, Kujargé, and a few other languages within Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic-speaking areas may turn out to be isolates upon further investigation. Defaka and Ega are highly divergent languages located within Niger-Congo-speaking areas, and may also possibly be language isolates.\nThe languages of New Guinea are poorly studied, and candidates for isolate status are likely to change when more becomes known about them. \n\n\n"}

The term lavender marriage dates from the early 20th century and is used almost exclusively to characterize certain marriages of public celebrities in the first half of the 20th century, primarily before World War II. At the time, public attitudes toward homosexuality made it impossible for a person to pursue a public career, notably in the Hollywood film industry, while acknowledging homosexuality. One of the earliest uses of the phrase appeared in the British press in 1895, at a time when lavender was associated with homosexuality.\n\nWith the inclusion of morality clauses in the contracts of Hollywood actors in the 1920s, some closeted stars contracted marriages of convenience to protect their public reputations and preserve their careers. A noteworthy exception that demonstrated the precarious position of the public homosexual was that of William Haines, who brought his career to a sudden end at the age of 35. He refused to end his relationship with his male partner, Jimmy Shields, and enter into a marriage at the direction of his studio employer, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nThe term lavender marriage has been used to characterize these couples/individuals:\n\n\n"}

According to Ethnologue, seven varieties of Romani are divergent enough to be considered languages of their own. The largest of these are Vlax Romani (about 500,000 speakers), Balkan Romani (600,000), and Sinte Romani (300,000). Some Romani communities speak mixed languages based on the surrounding language with retained Romani-derived vocabulary – these are known by linguists as Para-Romani varieties, rather than dialects of the Romani language itself.\n\nThe differences between the various varieties can be as large as, for example, the differences between the Slavic languages.\n\nSpeakers of the Romani language usually refer to the language as ' \"the Romani language\" or ' \"in a Rom way\". This derives from the Romani word ', meaning either \"a member of the (Romani) group\" or \"husband\". This is also where the term \"Roma\" derives in English, although some Roma groups refer to themselves using other demonyms (e.g. 'Kaale', 'Sinti', etc.). The English spelling \"Rromani language\" (with two initial Rs) may also be found, reflecting a different transcription of the Romani phoneme '.\n\nBefore the late nineteenth century, English-language texts usually referred to the language as the \"Gypsy language\". While it is derogatory, in the USA, \"gypsy\" is still the most-understood term, as \"Romani\" is not in common use there.\n\nIn the 18th century, it was shown by comparative studies that Romani belongs to the Indo-European language family. In 1763 Vályi István, a Calvinist pastor from Satu Mare in Transylvania, was the first to notice the similarity between Romani and Indo-Aryan by comparing the Romani dialect of Győr with the language (perhaps Sinhalese) spoken by three Sri Lankan students he met in the Netherlands. This was followed by the linguist Johann Christian Christoph Rüdiger (1751–1822) whose book ' (1782) proved Romani was descended from Sanskrit. This prompted the philosopher Christian Jakob Kraus to collect linguistic evidence by systematically interviewing the Roma in Königsberg prison. Kraus's findings were never published, but they may have influenced or laid the groundwork for later linguists, especially August Pott and his pioneering ' (1844–45). Research into the way the Romani dialects branched out was started in 1872 by the Slavicist Franc Miklošič in a series of essays. However, it was the philologist Ralph Turner's 1927 article “The Position of Romani in Indo-Aryan” that served as the basis for the integrating Romani into the history of Indian languages.\n\nRomani is an Indo-Aryan language that is part of the Balkan sprachbund. It is the only New Indo-Aryan spoken exclusively outside the Indian subcontinent.\n\nRomani is sometimes classified in the Central Zone or Northwestern Zone Indo-Aryan languages, and sometimes treated as a group of its own.\n\nRomani shares a number of features with the Central Zone languages. The most significant isoglosses are the shift of Old Indo-Aryan \"r̥\" to \"u\" or \"i\" (Sanskrit ', Romani ' 'to hear') and \"kṣ-\" to \"kh\" (Sanskrit ', Romani ' 'eye'). However, unlike other Central Zone languages, Romani preserves many dental clusters (Romani ' 'three', ' 'brother', compare Hindi ', '). This implies that Romani split from the Central Zone languages before the Middle Indo-Aryan period. However, Romani shows some features of New Indo-Aryan, such as erosion of the original nominal case system towards a nominative/oblique dichotomy, with new grammaticalized case suffixes added on. This means that the Romani exodus from India could not have happened until late in the first millennium.\n\nMany words are similar to the Marwari and Lambadi languages spoken in large parts of India. However, Romani is nearer to the Marwari spoken in Rajasthan, India.\n\nRomani also shows some similarity to the Northwestern Zone languages. In particular, the grammaticalization of enclitic pronouns as person markers on verbs (' 'done' + ' 'me' → \"\" 'I did') is also found in languages such as Kashmiri and Shina. This evidences a northwest migration during the split from the Central Zone languages consistent with a later migration to Europe.\n\nBased on these data, Matras (2006) views Romani as \"kind of Indian hybrid: a central Indic dialect that had undergone partial convergence with northern Indic languages.\"\n\nIn terms of its grammatical structures, Romani is conservative in maintaining almost intact the Middle Indo-Aryan present-tense person concord markers, and in maintaining consonantal endings for nominal case – both features that have been eroded in most other modern Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nRomani shows a number of phonetic changes that distinguish it from other Indo-Aryan languages – in particular, the devoicing of voiced aspirates (\"bh dh gh\" > \"ph th kh\"), shift of medial \"t d\" to \"l\", of short \"a\" to \"e\", initial \"kh\" to \"x\", rhoticization of retroflex \"ḍ, ṭ, ḍḍ, ṭṭ, ḍh\" etc. to \"r\" and \"ř\", and shift of inflectional \"-a\" to \"-o\".\n\nAfter leaving the Indian subcontinent, Romani was heavily affected by contact with European languages. The most significant of these was Medieval Greek, which contributed lexically, phonemically, and grammatically to Early Romani (10th–13th centuries). This includes inflectional affixes for nouns, and verbs that are still productive with borrowed vocabulary, the shift to VO word order, and the adoption of a preposed definite article. Early Romani also borrowed from Armenian and Persian.\n\nRomani and Domari share some similarities: agglutination of postpositions of the second layer (or case marking clitics) to the nominal stem, concord markers for the past tense, the neutralisation of gender marking in the plural, and the use of the oblique case as an accusative. This has prompted much discussion about the relationships between these two languages. Domari was once thought to be the \"sister language\" of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the Indian subcontinent, but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the Central Zone (Hindustani) group of languages. The Dom and the Rom therefore likely descend from two different migration waves out of India, separated by several centuries.\n\nThe first attestation of Romani is from 1542 AD in western Europe. The earlier history of the Romani language is completely undocumented, and is understood primarily through comparative linguistic evidence.\n\nLinguistic evaluation carried out in the nineteenth century by Pott (1845) and Miklosich (1882–1888) showed the Romani language to be a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA), not a Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA), establishing that the ancestors of the Romani could not have left India significantly earlier than AD 1000.\n\nThe principal argument favouring a migration during or after the transition period to NIA is the loss of the old system of nominal case, and its reduction to just a two-way case system, nominative vs. oblique. A secondary argument concerns the system of gender differentiation. Romani has only two genders (masculine and feminine). Middle Indo-Aryan languages (named MIA) generally had three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), and some modern Indo-Aryan languages retain this old system even today.\n\nIt is argued that loss of the neuter gender did not occur until the transition to NIA. Most of the neuter nouns became masculine while a few feminine, like the neuter (') in the Prakrit became the feminine (') in Hindi and \"\" in Romani. The parallels in grammatical gender evolution between Romani and other NIA languages have been cited as evidence that the forerunner of Romani remained on the Indian subcontinent until a later period, perhaps even as late as the tenth century.\n\nThere is no historical proof to clarify who the ancestors of the Romani were or what motivated them to emigrate from the Indian subcontinent, but there are various theories. The influence of Greek, and to a lesser extent of the Iranian languages (like Persian and Kurdish) and Armenian, points to a prolonged stay in Anatolia after the departure from South Asia.\n\nThe Mongol invasion of Europe beginning in the first half of the thirteenth century triggered another westward migration. The Romani arrived in Europe and afterwards spread to the other continents. The great distances between the scattered Romani groups led to the development of local community distinctions. The differing local influences have greatly affected the modern language, splitting it into a number of different (originally exclusively regional) dialects.\n\nToday Romani is spoken by small groups in 42 European countries. A project at Manchester University in England is transcribing Romani dialects, many of which are on the brink of extinction, for the first time.\n\nToday's dialects of Romani are differentiated by the vocabulary accumulated since their departure from Anatolia, as well as through divergent phonemic evolution and grammatical features. Many Roma no longer speak the language or speak various new contact languages from the local language with the addition of Romani vocabulary.\n\nDialect differentiation began with the dispersal of the Romani from the Balkans around the 14th century and on, and with their settlement in areas across Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The two most significant areas of divergence are the southeast (with epicenter of the northern Balkans) and west-central Europe (with epicenter Germany). The central dialects replace ' in grammatical paradigms with '. The west-northern dialects append ', simplify ' to ', retain ' in the nominalizer ' / ', and lose adjectival past-tense in intransitives (', ' → \"\" 'he/she went'). Other isoglosses (esp. demonstratives, 2/3pl perfective concord markers, loan verb markers) motivate the division into Balkan, Vlax, Central, Northeast, and Northwest dialects.\n\nA long-standing common categorisation was a division between the \"Vlax\" (from \"Vlach\") and \"non-Vlax\" dialects. \"Vlax\" are those Roma people who lived many centuries in the territory of Romania in slavery. The main distinction between the two groups is the degree to which their vocabulary is borrowed from Romanian. Bernard Gilliath-Smith first made this distinction, and coined the term \"Vlax\" in 1915 in the book \"The Report on the Gypsy tribes of North East Bulgaria\". The Vlax dialect group, now seen as just one of about ten groups (see below), has nevertheless become very widespread geographically.\n\nMatras (2002, 2005) has argued for a theory of geographical classification of Romani dialects, which is based on the diffusion in space of innovations. According to this theory, Early Romani (as spoken in the Byzantine Empire) was brought to western and other parts of Europe through population migrations of Rom in the 14th–15th centuries.\n\nThese groups settled in the various European regions during the 16th and 17th centuries, acquiring fluency in a variety of contact languages. Changes emerged then, which spread in wave-like patterns, creating the dialect differences attested today. According to Matras, there were two major centres of innovations: some changes emerged in western Europe (Germany and vicinity), spreading eastwards; other emerged in the Wallachian area, spreading to the west and south. In addition, many regional and local isoglosses formed, creating a complex wave of language boundaries. Matras points to the prothesis of ' in ' > ' 'egg' and ' > ' 'he' as typical examples of west-to-east diffusion, and of addition of prothetic ' in ' > ' as a typical east-to-west spread. His conclusion is that dialect differences formed in situ, and not as a result of different waves of migration.\n\nAccording to this classification, the dialects are split as follows:\n\nSIL Ethnologue has the following classification:\n\nIn a series of articles (beginning from 1982), Marcel Courthiade proposed a different kind of classification. He concentrates on the dialectal diversity of Romani in three successive strata of expansion, using the criteria of phonological and grammatical changes. Finding the common linguistic features of the dialects, he presents the historical evolution from the first stratum (the dialects closest to the Anatolian Romani of the 13th century) to the second and third strata. He also names as \"pogadialects\" (after the \"\" dialect of Great Britain) those with only a Romani vocabulary grafted into a non-Romani language (normally referred to as Para-Romani).\n\nA table of some dialectal differences:\nThe first stratum includes the oldest dialects: ' (of Tirana), ' (of Korça), ', ', ', ', ', ' (of Pristina), ' ('), ' ('), ', ', ' (from Finland), ', and the so-called \"Baltic dialects\".\n\nIn the second there are ' (of Podgorica), ', ', ', \" (of Agia Varvara)\n\nThe third comprises the rest of the so-called Gypsy dialects, including ', ', \".\n\nSome Romanies have developed mixed languages (chiefly by retaining Romani lexical items and adopting second language grammatical structures), including:\n\nRomani is the only Indo-Aryan language spoken almost exclusively in Europe (apart from emigrant populations).\n\nThe most concentrated areas of Romani speakers are found in Romania. Although there are no reliable figures for the exact number of Romani speakers, it may be the largest minority language of the European Union.\n\nThe language is recognized as a minority language in many countries. At present the only places in the world where Romani is employed as an official language are the Republic of Kosovo (only regionally, not nationally) and the Šuto Orizari Municipality within the administrative borders of the Macedonian capital of Skopje.\n\nThe first efforts to publish in Romani were undertaken in the interwar Soviet Union (using the Cyrillic script) and in communist Yugoslavia.\n\nSome traditional communities have expressed opposition to codifying Romani or having it used in public functions. However, the mainstream trend has been towards standardization.\n\nDifferent variants of the language are now in the process of being codified in those countries with high Romani populations (for example, Slovakia). There are also some attempts currently aimed at the creation of a unified standard language.\n\nA standardized form of Romani is used in Serbia, and in Serbia's autonomous province of Vojvodina, Romani is one of the officially recognized languages of minorities having its own radio stations and news broadcasts.\n\nIn Romania, a country with a sizable Romani minority (3.3% of the total population), there is a unified teaching system of the Romani language for all dialects spoken in the country. This is primarily a result of the work of Gheorghe Sarău, who made Romani textbooks for teaching Romani children in the Romani language. He teaches a purified, mildly prescriptive language, choosing the original Indo-Aryan words and grammatical elements from various dialects. The pronunciation is mostly like that of the dialects from the first stratum. When there are more variants in the dialects, the variant that most closely resembles the oldest forms is chosen, like ', instead of ', ', ' instead of ', ' instead of ' or ', etc.\n\nAn effort is also made to derive new words from the vocabulary already in use, \"i.e.\", ' (airplane), ' (slide rule), ' (retrospectively), ' (adjective). There is an ever-changing set of borrowings from Romanian as well, including such terms as ' (weather, time), ' (town hall), ' (cream), ' (saint, holy). Hindi-based neologisms include ' (bulb, electricity), ' (example), ' (drawing, design), ' (writing), while there are also English-based neologisms, like \"\" < \"to print\".\n\nRomani is now used on the internet, in some local media, and in some countries as a medium of instruction.\n\nHistorically, Romani was an exclusively unwritten language; for example, Slovakian Romani's orthography was codified only in 1971.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of academic and non-academic literature produced currently in Romani is written using a Latin-based orthography.\nThe proposals to form a unified Romani alphabet and one standard Romani language by either choosing one dialect as a standard, or by merging more dialects together, have not been successful - instead, the trend is towards a model where each dialect has its own writing system. Among native speakers, the most common pattern for individual authors to use an orthography based on the writing system of the dominant contact language: thus Romanian in Romania, Hungarian in Hungary and so on.\n\nTo demonstrate the differences, the phrase [romaɲi tʃʰib], which means \"Romani language\" in all the dialects, can be written as ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', \"\" and so on.\n\nA currently observable trend, however, appears to be the adoption of a loosely English and Czech-oriented orthography, developed spontaneously by native speakers for use online and through email.\n\nThe Romani sound system is not highly unusual among European languages. Its most marked features are a three-way contrast between unvoiced, voiced, and aspirated stops: \"p t k č\", \"b d g dž\", and \"ph th kh čh\", and the presence in some dialects of a second rhotic \"ř\", realized as uvular [ʀ], a long trill [r:], or retroflex [ɽ] or [ɻ].\n\nThe following is the core sound inventory of Romani. Phonemes in parentheses are only found in some dialects:\n\nEastern and Southeastern European Romani dialects commonly have palatalized consonants, either distinctive or allophonic. Some dialects add the central vowel or . Vowel length is often distinctive in Western European Romani dialects. Loans from contact languages often allow other non-native phonemes.\n\nConservative dialects of Romani have final stress, with the exception of some unstressed affixes (e.g. the vocative ending, the case endings added on to the accusative noun, and the remoteness tense marker). Central and western European dialects often have shifted stress earlier in the word.\n\nAt the end of the word, voiced consonants become voiceless and aspirated ones lose aspiration. However, both are kept written as voiced / aspirated one. Examples:\n\nNominals in Romani are nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals. Some sources describe articles as nominals.\n\nThe indefinite article is often borrowed from the local contact language.\n\nGeneral Romani is an unusual language, in having two classes of nominals, based on the historic origin of the word, that have a completely different morphology. The two classes can be called \"inherited\" and \"borrowed\", but this article uses names from Matras (2006), \"ikeoclitic\" and \"xenoclitic\". The class to which a word belongs is obvious from its ending.\n\nThe first class is the old, Indian vocabulary (and to some extent Persian, Armenian and Greek loanwords). The ikeoclitic class can also be divided into two sub-classes, based on the ending.\n\nThe ending of words in this sub-class is -o with masculines, -i with feminines, with the latter ending triggering palatalisation of preceding \"d, t, n, l\" to \"ď, ť, ň, ľ\".\n\nExamples:\n\nAll words in this sub-class have no endings, regardless of gender.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe second class is loanwords from European languages. (Matras adds that the morphology of the new loanwords might be borrowed from Greek.)\n\nThe ending of borrowed masculine is -os, -is, -as, -us, and the borrowed feminine ends in -a.\n\nExamples from Slovakian Romani:\n\nRomani has two grammatical genders (masculine / feminine) and two numbers (singular / plural).\n\nAll nominals can be singular or plural.\n\nNouns are marked for case, the most important being the nominative and the accusative case.\n\nThe vocative, nominative and indirect case are a bit \"outside\" of the case system as are produced only by adding a suffix to the root.\n\nExample: the suffix for singular masculine vocative of ikeoclitic types is .\n\nThe other five cases are a little different. They are all derived from an \"indirect root\", that is made a little differently for each type; the indirect root is the same as the accusative case. To this root, every case adds its own suffix, with disregard to gender or type: ' / ' (locative and prepositional), ' / ' (dative), ' (ablative), ' (instrumental and comitative), and ' / ' (genitive).\n\nExample: The endings for o/i ending nominals are as follows:\nExample: the suffix for indirect root for masculine plural for all inherited words is ', the dativ suffix is '.\n\nThere are many declension classes of nouns that decline differently, and show dialectal variation.\n\nSlovakian Romani also uses these nine cases:\n\nThe indirect case is used when a word functions as an attribute before a word, and is not considered a case in some literature.\n\nRomani shows the typically Indo-Aryan pattern of the genitive agreeing with its head noun.\n\nExample:\n\nAdjectives and the definite article show agreement with the noun they modify.\n\nExample:\n\nRomani derivations are highly synthetic and partly agglutinative. However, they are also sensitive to recent development - for example, in general, Romani in Slavic countries show an adoption of productive aktionsart morphology.\n\nThe core of the verb is the lexical root, verb morphology is suffixed.\n\nThe verb stem (including derivation markers) by itself has non-perfective aspect and is present or subjunctive.\n\nSimilarly to nominals, verbs in Romani belong to several classes, but unlike nominals, these are not based on historical origin. However, the loaned verbs can be recognized, again, by specific endings, which some argue are Greek in origin.\n\nSome words are irregular, like \"\" - to be.\n\nThe next three classes are recognizable by suffix in 3rd person singular.\n\nThe first class, called I., has a suffix \"\" in 3rd person singular.\n\nExamples, in 3 ps. sg:\n\nWords in the second category, called II., have a suffix \"\" in 3rd person singular.\n\nExamples, in 3 ps. sg:\n\nAll the words in the third class are semantically causative passive.\n\nExamples:\n\nBorrowed verbs from other languages are marked with affixes taken from Greek tense/aspect suffixes, including ', ', and \".\n\nThe Romani verb has three persons and two numbers, singular and plural. There is no verbal distinction between masculine and feminine.\n\nRomani tenses are, not exclusively, present tense, future tense, two past tenses (perfect and imperfect), present or past conditional and present imperative.\n\nDepending on the dialect, the suffix ' marks the present, future, or conditional. There are many perfective suffixes, which are determined by root phonology, valency, and semantics: e.g. ' 'did'.\n\nThere are two sets of personal conjugation suffixes, one for non-perfective verbs, and another for perfective verbs. The non-perfective personal suffixes, continued from Middle Indo-Aryan, are as follows:\nThese are slightly different for consonant- and vowel-final roots (e.g. ' 'you eat', ' 'you want').\n\nThe perfective suffixes, deriving from late Middle Indo-Aryan enclitic pronouns, are as follows:\nVerbs may also take a further remoteness suffix ' / ' / ' / '. With non-perfective verbs this marks the imperfect, habitual, or conditional. With the perfective, this marks the pluperfect or counterfactual.\n\nAll the persons and numbers of present tense of the word \"\"\nVarious tenses of the same word, all in 2nd person singular.\n\nAll the persons and numbers of present tense of the word \"\nVarious tenses of the word \"\", all in 2nd person singular.\n\nAll the persons and numbers of present tense of the word '. Note the added ', which is typical for this group.\nVarious tenses of the same word, all in 2nd person singular again.\n\nValency markers are affixed to the verb root either to increase or decrease valency. There is dialectal variation as to which markers are most used; common valency-increasing markers are ', ', and ', and common valency-decreasing markers are ' and \"\". These may also be used to derive verbs from nouns and adjectives.\n\nRomani syntax is quite different from most Indo-Aryan languages, and shows more similarity to the Balkan languages.\n\nŠebková and Žlnayová, while describing Slovakian Romani, argues that Romani is a free word order language and that it allows for theme-rheme structure, similarly to Czech, and that in some Romani dialects in East Slovakia, there is a tendency to put a verb at the end of a sentence.\n\nHowever, Matras describes it further. According to Matras, in most dialects of Romani, Romani is a VO language, with SVO order in contrastive sentences and verb-subject-object order in thetic sentences. The tendency to put verb on the end in some dialects is the Slavic influence.\n\nExamples, from Slovakian Romani:\n\nClauses are usually finite. Relative clauses, introduced by the relativizer \"kaj\", are postponed. Factual and non-factual complex clauses are distinguished.\n\nRomani has lent several words to English such as \"pal\" (ultimately from Sanskrit ' \"brother\") and \"nark\" \"informant\" (from Romani ' \"nose\"). Other Romani words in general slang are \"gadgie\" (originally meaning \"person who's not Roma\", currently used as a gender-neutral term for boyfriend/girlfriend in Bulgaria), \"shiv\" or \"chiv\" (knife). Urban British slang shows an increasing level of Romani influence, with some words becoming accepted into the lexicon of standard English (for example, \"chav\" from an assumed Anglo-Romani word, meaning \"small boy\", in the majority of dialects). There are efforts to teach and familiarise Vlax-Romani to new generation of Romani so that Romani spoken in different parts of the world are connected through a single dialect of Romani. Indian Institute of Romani Studies, Chandigarh published several Romani language lessons through its journal \"Roma\" during the 1970s.\nOccasionally loanwords from other Indo-Iranian languages such as Hindi are mistakenly labelled as Romani due to surface similarities (due to a shared root), such as \"cushy\", which is from Hindi (itself a loan from Persian \"\") meaning \"excellent, healthy, happy\".\n\n\n\n"}

Semiotics of photography is the observation of symbolism used within photography or \"reading\" the picture. This article refers to realistic, unedited photographs not those that have been manipulated in any way.\nRoland Barthes was one of the first people to study the semiotics of images. He developed a way to understand the meaning of images. Most of Barthes' studies related to advertising, but his concepts can apply to photography as well.\n\nDenotation refers to the meaning hidden in symbols or images. A denotation is \"what we see\" in the picture or what is \"there\" in the picture. According to author Clive Scott, this is another way of saying that a photograph has both a signified and a referent, is both coded and encoded. This is to re-emphasize the co-existence of the iconic and idexical. In photography the photo itself is the signifier, the signified is what the image is or represents. The literal meaning of the image.\n\nConnotation (Semiotics) is arbitrary in that the meanings brought to the image are based on rules or conventions that the reader has learnt. Connotation attaches additional meaning to the first signifier, which is why the first signifier is often described in multiple words that include things like camera angle, color, lighting, etc. It is the immediate cultural meaning from what is seen in the picture, but not what is actually there. Connotation is what is implied by the image.\n\nAccording to Roland Barthes the coded iconic message is the story that the image portrays. This message is easily understood and the images represent a clear relationship. The \"reader\" of the image applies their knowledge to the encoding of the photo. An image of a bowl of fruit for example might imply still life, freshness or market stalls.\n\nNoncoded iconic is another part of Barthes' theory of understanding images. Noncoded has nothing to do with the emotions from the image as a whole. It is the \"literal\" denotation, the recognition of identifiable object in the photograph, irrespective of the larger societal code. Using the bowl of fruit example, this photograph is just that, a bowl of fruit. A non-coded iconic has no deeper meaning, the image is exactly what it shows.\n\n\n"}
