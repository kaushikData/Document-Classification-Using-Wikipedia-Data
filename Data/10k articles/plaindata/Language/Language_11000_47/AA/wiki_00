(died 1078 AD) was a renowned Persian scholar of the Arabic language, literary theorist, grammarian and Shafi'i Muslim. al-Jurjānī was an Ahsa'ari descendant, and born in the town of Gorgan in Iran.\n\nAl-Jurjānī is said not to have left his home town of Gorgan all his life, yet his reputation reached many Arabic scholars who came to see him. He excelled in the two sciences of \"ilm al balaghah\" (eloquence and rhetorical art) and \"ilm al bayan\" (a branch of Arabic rhetoric dealing with metaphorical language), which he explained in his two books \"Asrār al-Balāghah\" (\"Secrets of Rhetoric\"), and \"Dalāʾīl al-ʿIjāz fi-l-Qurʾān\" (\"Arguments of the Miraculous Inimitability of the Quran\"). Al-Jurjānī was influenced by his predecessors such as the grammarian Sibawayh, the critic Abi Helal al-'Askari al Balaghi, and the linguist and literary theorist Abu Ali al-Farisi, known for his book \"al-Idah\" (\"Elucidation\").\n\nAli al-Farisi's nephew, Abi al-Hussein Muhammad Bin al-Hassan Bin Abd al-Wareth al-Faressi al-Nawawi, was al-Jurjānī's teacher, and taught al-Jurjānī the \"al-Idah\".

At the surface level there are five distinctive tones: high, low, falling, rising and mid. Mid tone is the result of downstep of a high tone after a low tone. The contour tones (falling and rising) either occur on long vowels or diphthongs, from a sequence of high+low or low+high, or on short vowels produced from the contraction of such a long vowel or diphthong. Rising tones are rather uncommon, as they tend to be replaced by high, low or mid.\n\nConsonants of the Ekpheli dialect are:\nThe consonants marked long have been analyzed in various ways, including 'tense' or 'fortis' and paired up with 'lax' or 'lenis' partners, though there is no phonological basis for grouping the supposed 'long' consonants together, or for partnering them with particular 'short' consonants.

However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his metaphysical or physical nature, but rather in his work.

Thus man should be defined as \"animal symbolicum\" (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). \nOn this basis, Cassirer sought to understand human nature by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience.

{"id": "2697067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2697067", "title": "Botanical nomenclature", "text": "Botanical nomenclature\n\nBotanical nomenclature is the formal, scientific naming of plants. It is related to, but distinct from taxonomy. Plant taxonomy is concerned with grouping and classifying plants; botanical nomenclature then provides names for the results of this process. The starting point for modern botanical nomenclature is Linnaeus' \"Species Plantarum\" of 1753. Botanical nomenclature is governed by the \"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\" (\"ICN\"), which replaces the \"International Code of Botanical Nomenclature\" (\"ICBN\"). Fossil plants are also covered by the code of nomenclature.\n\nWithin the limits set by that code there is another set of rules, the \"International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP)\" which applies to plant cultivars that have been deliberately altered or selected by humans (see cultigen).\n\nBotanical nomenclature has a long history, going back beyond the period when Latin was the scientific language throughout Europe, to Theophrastus (c. 370–287 BC), Dioscorides (c. 40 – 90 AD) and other Greek writers. Many of these works have come down to us in Latin translations. The principal Latin writer on botany was Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD). From Mediaeval times, Latin became the universal scientific language (lingua franca) in Europe. Most written plant knowledge was the property of monks, particularly Benedictine, and the purpose of those early herbals was primarily medicinal rather than plant science \"per se\". It would require the invention of the printing press (1450) to make such information more widely available.\n\nLeonhart Fuchs, a German physician and botanist is often considered the originator of Latin names for the rapidly increasing number of plants known to science. For instance he coined the name \"Digitalis\" in his \"De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes\" (1542).\n\nA key event was Linnaeus’ adoption of binomial names for plant species in his \"Species Plantarum\" (1753).\n\nIn the nineteenth century it became increasingly clear that there was a need for rules to govern scientific nomenclature, and initiatives were taken to refine the body of laws initiated by Linnaeus. These were published in successively more sophisticated editions. For plants, key dates are 1867 (\"lois\" de Candolle) and 1906 (\"International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature\", 'Vienna Rules'). The most recent is the \"Melbourne Code\", adopted in 2011.\n\nAnother development was the insight into the delimitation of the concept of 'plant'. Gradually more and more groups of organisms are being recognised as being independent of plants. Nevertheless, the formal names of most of these organisms are governed by the (ICN), even today. Some protists that do not fit easily into either plant or animal categories are treated under either or both of the ICN and the ICZN. A separate \"Code\" was adopted to govern the nomenclature of Bacteria, the \"International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria\".\n\nBotanical nomenclature is closely linked to plant taxonomy, and botanical nomenclature serves plant taxonomy, but nevertheless botanical nomenclature is separate from plant taxonomy. Botanical nomenclature is merely the body of rules prescribing which name applies to that taxon (see correct name) and if a new name may (or must) be coined.\n\nPlant taxonomy is an empirical science, a science that determines what constitutes a particular taxon (taxonomic grouping, plural: taxa): e.g. \"What plants belong to this species?\" and \"What species belong to this genus?\". The definition of the limits of a taxon is called its 'circumscription'. For a particular taxon, if two taxonomists agree exactly on its circumscription, rank and position (i.e. the higher rank in which it is included) then there is only one name which can apply under the \"ICN\". Where they differ in opinion on any of these issues, one and the same plant may be placed in taxa with different names. As an example, consider Siehe's Glory-of-the-Snow, \"Chionodoxa siehei\":\n\n\nIn summary, if a plant has different names or is placed in differently named taxa: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "9051857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9051857", "title": "Carnival game", "text": "Carnival game\n\nA carnival game is a game of chance or skill that can be seen at a traveling carnival, charity fund raiser, amusement arcade and amusement park, or on a state and county fair midway. They are also commonly played on holidays such as Mardi Gras, Saint Patrick's Day, and Oktoberfest.\n\nCarnival games are usually operated on a \"pay per play\" basis. Prices may range from a small amount, for example 25 cents, to a few dollars per play. Most games offer a small prize to the winner. Prizes may include items like stuffed animals, toys, or posters. Continued play is encouraged as multiple small prizes may be traded in for a larger prize. Multiplayer games—the \"Watergun\" game is one example—may change the size of the prize with the number of players. In a more difficult game, including the \"Baseball and Basket\" or \"Stand the Bottle\", a large prize may be awarded to any winner.\n\nCarnival games have a poor reputation in some areas. This may be that some carnival games utilize optical illusions or physical relationships that make it hard for a player to judge the game's difficulty. Also, some operators have run games that are rigged to take advantage of unsuspecting players. In many areas, these games are tested by local law enforcement to find unfairly run games.\n\nAt amusement parks, the carnival games are usually owned and operated by the park owner. The games are usually installed in permanent buildings stationed around the park. A traveling carnival may, however, be made up of multiple independent game concession owners. These independents owners contract their games with the carnival operator. Carnival games of this type are mounted to towable trailers that enable the game to be moved from site to site. However, there a still some free-standing game booths that are assembled on site. These carnival games are usually set up in rows along the midway area along with the rides.\n\nGames of chance are favorite carnival games. A random outcome gives all players the chance of winning a prize. An example of a carnival game of chance is the \"Dime Pitch\" game. The objective is to toss a coin (typically a dime or quarter) onto a horizontal board that has random marks on it. The marks on the board are the same diameter as the coin thrown. By completely covering the mark on the board with the coin, the player wins. Another example of a game of chance is the \"Birthday\" game. Players place their bets on a rail mounted strip that has months, colors and holidays written on it. Many players choose the month of their birth for their bet. A random player is then selected to throw a large multisided die into a designated center area (play area) of the booth. The die thrown has corresponding months, colors and holidays written on the different sides. The month, color or holiday that shows on the top of the thrown die, when it stops, will indicate the winner.\n\nIn the \"Pingpong Ball and Fish Bowl\", players throw pingpong balls at a table filled with rows of empty small fish bowls. If the player gets a ball in the bowl, they usually win a goldfish. A game like the \"Duck Pond\", which is geared for young children, may offer a winner every time. The player selects a rubber duck that is floating at random in water. Writing on the bottom of the duck reveals the prize won.\n\nGames of skill are another favorite carnival game. These games may test a players aim at hitting a target with either a ball or a weapon. Some games of this type are the \"Cross Bow Shoot\", the \"Milk Bottle\" game, or the \"Balloon and Dart\" game.\n\nOther skill testing games challenge the physical abilities of the player. One example of this type of game is the \"Rope Ladder Climb\". In this game, the player must keep their balance while climbing an angled rope ladder that can pivot and invert the player. The object of the game is to climb the ladder, without falling off, and ring a bell at the end of the climb. Another game that tests the physical abilities of the player is \"Ring the Bell\". The player uses a large mallet to strike a pivot board on the game, this causes an indicator to be driven vertically up an indicator scale board. By hitting the pivot hard enough, the indicator will ring a bell mounted at the top of the indicator scale board indicating a win. Cover the spot is a game that involves covering a giant red spot with five smaller discs dropped by hand; all red (or color) must be covered to win.\n\nCarnival games are often viewed or portrayed as dishonest, due to past history that may not necessarily apply to modern-day games and operators. The term \"mark\" (meaning sucker) originated with the carnival.\n\nWhen dishonest carnival game operators found someone who they could entice to keep playing their rigged (slang term: \"gaffed\") game, they would then \"mark\" the individual by patting their back with a hand that had chalk on it. Other game operators would then look for these chalk marks and entice the individuals to also play their rigged game.\n\nRigging a carnival game may be done in many different manners depending on the game. For example, the \"Ball and Basket\" game may be rigged by moving the \"A\" frame onto which the basket is mounted. This would change the trajectory of the ball. Another method has the operator leaving a ball in the basket for the demonstration which absorbs the energy of the tossed ball, enabling the ball to stay in the basket, and then remove it when the mark plays, which makes the ball much more susceptible to bouncing out. In a game like \"Ring Toss\", the blocks that the prizes are attached to are cut in such a way as to ensure the ring will not fit. The \"Balloon and Dart\" game can be rigged by underinflating the balloons or by using dull point darts. Some games may be rigged to play honestly or dishonestly and can be switched by the game operator. The \"Milk Bottle\" game can be rigged this way. On a rigged game, one of the milk bottles is heavier than the others. Depending on how the bottles are stacked will determine if the player will win.\n\nSome games are simply impossible to win. One such game is the \"Push 'em Up\" (or \"Stand the Bottle\") game, which requires the player to stand up a bottle with a 2-tine plastic fork, was featured in episode 5 of Penn & Teller Tell a Lie. The bottles used in the game are weighted on one side, which makes it impossible to stand the bottles upright without tipping them over when the heavier side is rotated to the top. The \"Bottle Up,\" often confused with this game, is simply a skill game where the player uses a fishing pole with a ring attached to the end of the string to stand up the bottle.\n\nBy rigging the game, the game operators can vastly increase the money they take in.\n\nIn many areas, local law enforcement will test the carnival games prior to and during the carnival to help eliminate rigged games. However, there are still some dishonest game operators. One method they use to avoid law enforcement is to give legitimate instruments or make the carnival game \"fair-and-square\" during testing, but rig it for other people.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "489748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=489748", "title": "Coprolalia", "text": "Coprolalia\n\nCoprolalia is involuntary swearing or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. Coprolalia comes from the Greek κόπρος (\"kopros\") meaning \"feces\" and λαλιά (\"lalia\") from \"lalein\", \"to talk\".\n\nCoprolalia is an occasional characteristic of tic disorders, in particular Tourette syndrome, although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia. It is not unique to tic disorders; it is also a rare symptom of other neurological disorders.\n\nRelated involuntary actions are copropraxia, performing obscene or forbidden gestures, and coprographia, making obscene writings or drawings.\n\nCoprolalia encompasses words and phrases that are culturally taboo or generally unsuitable for acceptable social use, when used out of context. The term is not used to describe contextual swearing. It is usually expressed out of social or emotional context, and may be spoken in a louder tone or different cadence or pitch than normal conversation. It can be a single word, or complex phrases. A person with coprolalia may repeat the word mentally rather than saying it out loud; these subvocalizations can be very distressing.\n\nCoprolalia is an occasional characteristic of Tourette syndrome, although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's. In Tourette syndrome, compulsive swearing can be uncontrollable and undesired by the person uttering the phrases. Involuntary outbursts, such as racial or ethnic slurs in the company of those most offended by such remarks, can be particularly embarrassing. The phrases uttered by a person with coprolalia do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of the person.\n\nCases of deaf Tourette patients swearing in sign language have been described, showing that coprolalia is not just a consequence of the short and sudden sound pattern of many swear words.\n\nCoprolalia is not unique to tic disorders; it is also a rare symptom of other neurological disorders. It may occur after injuries to the brain such as stroke and encephalitis; in other neurological conditions such as choreoacanthocytosis, seizures, and Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; and rarely in persons with dementia or obsessive-compulsive disorder in the absence of tics.\n\nOnly about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia, but it tends to attract more attention than any other symptom. There is a paucity of epidemiological studies of Tourette syndrome; ascertainment bias affects clinical studies. Studies on people with Tourette's often \"came from tertiary referral samples, the sickest of the sick\". Further, the criteria for a diagnosis of Tourette's were changed in 2000, when the impairment criterion was removed from the DSM-IV-TR for all tic disorders, resulting in increased diagnoses of milder cases. Further, many clinical studies suffer from small sample size. These factors combine to render older estimates of coprolalia—biased towards clinical populations of the more severe cases—outdated. An international, multi-site database of 3,500 individuals with Tourette syndrome drawn from clinical samples found 14% of patients with Tourette's accompanied by comorbid conditions had coprolalia, while only 6% of those with uncomplicated (\"pure\") Tourette's had coprolalia. The same study found that the chance of having coprolalia increased linearly with the number of comorbid conditions: patients with four or five other conditions—in addition to tics—were four to six times more likely to have coprolalia than persons with only Tourette's. One study of a general pediatric practice found an 8% rate of coprolalia in children with Tourette syndrome, while another study found 60% in a tertiary referral center (where typically more severe cases are referred). A more recent Brazilian study of 44 patients with Tourette syndrome found a 14% rate of coprolalia; a Costa Rican study of 85 subjects found 20% had coprolalia; a Chilean study of 70 patients found an 8.5% rate of coprolalia; older studies in Japan reported a 4% incidence of coprolalia; and a still older clinical study in Brazil found 28% of 32 patients had coprolalia. Most studies indicate a prevalence >30%. Considering the methodological issues affecting all of these reports, the consensus of the Tourette Syndrome Association is that the actual number is below 15 percent.\n\nSome patients have been treated by injecting botulinum toxin (botox) near the vocal cords. This does not prevent the vocalizations, but the partial paralysis that results helps to control the volume of any outbursts. Surprisingly, botox injections result in more generalized relief of tics than the vocal relief expected.\n\nThe severity and frequency of outbursts can also be decreased by surgically disabling nuclei in the thalamus, the globus pallidus and the cingulate cortex.\n\nThe entertainment industry often depicts those with Tourette syndrome as being social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered stigmatization and the public's misunderstanding of those with Tourette's. The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette's are also fodder for radio and television talk shows.\n\n"}

These remade songs are known as cover songs. New or unknown bands often find the format marketable for smaller venues, such as pubs, clubs, or parks. The bands also perform at private events, for example, weddings and birthday parties and may be known as a wedding band, party band, function band or band-for-hire. A band whose covers consist mainly of songs that were chart hits is often called a top 40 band. Some bands, however, start as cover bands, then grow to perform original material. For example, The Rolling Stones released three albums consisting primarily of covers before recording one with their own original material.\n\nCover bands play several types of venues. When a band is starting out, they might play private parties and fundraisers, often for little or no money, or in return for food and bar privileges, although many professional musicians refuse to do this. With enough experience, a band will begin to \"play out\" professionally at bars and night clubs. Some cover bands are made up of full-time professional musicians. These bands are usually represented by an entertainment agency.\n\nUnlike some famous bands, when the cover bands consist of professional musicians they often do not have a fixed line up of musicians, rather they are often made up of a flexible line up of session musicians, utilizing \"dep\" (deputy, that is, stand-in) musicians where necessary. The music industry is considered by many musicians as a relatively difficult industry to make an income in, and cover bands can be a good source of income for professional musicians alongside other work.\n\nCover bands play songs written and recorded by other artists, usually well-known songs (as compared to \"original\" bands which play music they themselves have written). There are a wide variety of cover bands – some cover bands play material from particular decades, for example, a 1980s cover band. Others focus exclusively on the music of a particular group, usually iconic groups, and are called tribute bands. It is not uncommon to find tribute bands performing the songs of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Oasis, Duran Duran, Aerosmith, or U2. Some cover bands will play a variety of song styles, from different artists, genres, and decades. Another type of cover band is one that plays songs in a different genre or style than that of the original composition (e.g., jazz versions of what were originally hard rock songs).\n\nSome cover bands perform covers that are of a different musical genre from the originals.

The causes are varied and might demonstrate either the expansion or contraction of a species range.\n\nAlso called range fragmentation, disjunct distributions may be caused by changes in the environment, such as mountain building and continental drift or rising sea levels; it may also be due to an organism expanding its range into new areas, by such means as rafting, or other animals transporting an organism to a new location (plant seeds consumed by birds and animals, can be moved to new locations during bird or animals migrations, and those seeds can be deposited in new locations in fecal matter). Other conditions that can produce disjunct distributions include: flooding, or changes in wind, stream, and current flows, plus others such as anthropogenic introduction of alien introduced species either accidentally or deliberately (agriculture and horticulture).\n\nDisjunct distributions can occur when suitable habitat is fragmented, which produces fragmented populations, and when that fragmentation becomes so divergent that species movement between one suitable habitat to the next is disrupted, isolated population can be produced. Extinctions can cause disjunct distribution, especially in areas where only scattered areas are habitable by a species; for instance, island chains or specific elevations along a mountain range or areas along a coast or between bodies of water like streams, lakes and ponds.\n\nThere are many patterns of disjunct distributions at many scales: Irano-Turanian disjunction, Europe - East Asia, Europe-South Africa (e.g. genus \"Erica\"), Mediterranean-Hoggart disjunction (genus \"Olea\"), etc.\n\nThis kind of disjunct distribution of a species, such that it occurs in Iberia and in Ireland, without any intermediate localities, is usually called \"Lusitanian\" (named after the Roman Province Lusitania, corresponding to modern day Portugal).\n\nExamples of animal species with a Lusitanian distribution are: the Kerry slug \"Geomalacus maculosus\" and the Pyrenean glass snail \"Semilimax pyrenaicus\". Plant species with this kind of distribution include several heather species (\"Calluna\" spp.) and the strawberry tree (\"Arbutus unedo\").\n\nThe theory behind the name \"Lusitanian\" is now discredited; it posited that there was an ice-free land mass that served as a refugium off of the south-west of Ireland during the Quaternary (last) glaciation. In this refugium, relic fauna and flora from a previous ice-free period survived until the present warmer interstadial period. Although the theory is no longer accepted, the term Lusitanian is still used as a descriptive term for faunal elements such as the Kerry slug.\nRecently a better explanation of the occurrence of the Kerry slug and similar faunal elements in southwestern Ireland has been developed. This new theory is supported by two recent discoveries: the genetic similarity of much of Ireland’s fauna to that of northern Spain, and the genetic similarity of much of Ireland’s human population to that of northern Spain.\n\nMascheretti et al. (2003) examined the genotypes of Eurasian pygmy shrew, a small mammal, across its range in Europe. The Irish population showed close genetic affinity to a population from Andorra but not to that of Britain or other places in Europe. The genetic structure of the population further showed that the entire Irish population of the Eurasian pygmy shrew had originated from a single founder event. The authors concluded that it had been introduced in the early (Palaeolithic) or middle (Mesolithic) Stone Age, by boat, probably from south-west Europe. This coincides with work on human populations, which found a strong genetic similarity in make-up between populations in western Ireland and in northern Spain. This would be explained by a human migration from Spain to Ireland in the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic.\n\nIt seems increasingly likely that much of Ireland’s Lusitanian fauna is in reality an artefact of this era of human expansion in the early part of the Postglacial era. In other words, it seems likely that these species were introduced accidentally with trade items or goods brought by boat from Iberia.\n\n"}
{"id": "1343957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1343957", "title": "Dominance and submission", "text": "Dominance and submission\n\nDominance and submission (also called D/s) is a set of behaviours, customs, and rituals involving the submission of one person to another in an erotic episode or lifestyle. It is a subset of BDSM.\n\nPhysical contact is not necessary, and D/s can be conducted anonymously over the telephone, email, or other messaging systems. In other cases, it can be intensely physical, sometimes crossing into sadomasochism. In D/s, both parties take pleasure or erotic enjoyment from either dominating or being dominated. Those who take the superior position are called dominants—Doms (male) or Dommes (female)—while those who take the subordinate position are called submissives—or subs (male or female). A switch is an individual who plays either role. Two switches together may negotiate and exchange roles several times in a session. A dominatrix is usually a female sex worker who dominates others for pay.\n\nIt is common for writers to capitalise the \"D\" in Dominant but leave the \"s\" in lowercase for the submissive. Many extend this to His/Hers, Him/Her, He/She, etc., to make it clear when they are referring to a Dominant.\n\nThe inner conflict and surrender connected with dominance and submission are enduring themes in human culture and civilization. In human sexuality, this has broadened to include mutual exploration of roles, emotions, and activities that would be difficult or impossible to act out without a willing partner taking an opposing role.\n\nA 1985 study suggests that only about 30 percent of participants in BDSM activities are females. A 1995 study indicates that 89% of heterosexual females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for the submissive-recipient role in sexual bondage, expressing also a preference for a dominant male, and that 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role.\n\nA \"safeword\" is usually given to the submissive partner to prevent the dominant from overstepping physical and emotional boundaries. The safeword is especially important when engaging in verbal humiliation or playing \"mind-games\", because the dominant may not be aware of an emotional boundary until it is crossed. If an emotional boundary is breached and the safeword spoken, the dominant should cease all play immediately and discuss the emotional breach with the submissive in a tender and understanding manner. Negotiating limits in advance is also an important element in a D/s relationship.\n\nIt is important to note that for a safe, sane, and consensual environment to be maintained, all participants should have a safeword of which the other is aware; this includes the Dominant partner. While it may not seem so from the outside, Dominants will also have limits and boundaries of their own, and should not only have a safeword but also be comfortable calling it if their own limits are exceeded. This includes cases where the dominant may feel things have gone too far and is uncomfortable continuing. As with any other participant, the dominant's safeword call should herald the stopping of all play and the start of a recuperative discussion between the participants.\n\nD/s may be ritualized or freeform. It is usually a negotiated lifestyle, with people discussing their wishes, limits, and needs in order to find commonality. A D/s relationship may be sexual or non-sexual, long- or short-term, and intimate or anonymous. Most adherents search for the essential intensity, trust, and intimacy that are required to make any deep relationship possible.\n\nBased on gender (of the dominant or submissive), D/s can be divided into the following sub-types:-\n\n\nD/s participants often refer to their activity as \"play\", with an individual play session being called a \"scene\". In addition to \"dominant\" and \"submissive\", a \"switch\" is a person who can take either role. A scene between two switches can involve trading off the dominant and submissive roles, possibly several times. In contrast, the terms \"top\" and \"bottom\" refer to the active (agent) and passive (patient) roles, respectively. In a given scene, there is no requirement that the dominant also be the top, or that the submissive be the bottom, although this is often the case.\n\nThe term \"vanilla\" refers to normative (\"non-kinky\") sex and relationships, the vanilla world being mainstream society outside of the BDSM subculture. The term comes from vanilla ice cream being considered the \"default\" flavor.\n\nSome people in the D/s world capitalize words and names that refer to dominants, and do not capitalize those that refer to submissives, hence the capitalization of D/s; others do not. It was popularized in internet chatrooms, to make it easier to identify the orientation of the writer or the person being written about.\n\nAlso, some submissives eschew personal pronouns, instead referring to themselves as \"this slave\" or \"Master Bob's girl\". This is sometimes considered an expression of modesty, but it is an entirely optional method of depersonalizing a submissive during \"play\". It may have roots in the military, where new recruits are required to refer to themselves as \"this recruit\", rather than \"I\" or \"me\".\n\nThere can be any number of partners in a D/s relationship: one dominant may have several submissives, who may in turn dominate others, or a submissive may have multiple dominants. Relationships may be monogamous or polyamorous. Romantic love is not necessarily a feature in D/s: partners might be very much in love or have no romantic relationship at all. Some D/s relationships are sexual, others completely chaste.\n\nFantasy role play can be an element, with partners taking classic dominant or submissive roles, or classic authority-figure roles such as teacher and student, police officer and suspect, or parent and child. Animal play, where one partner takes the role of owner or caretaker and the other takes the part of a pet or animal, can also be D/s play.\n\nA classic example of a D/s role is the \"sissy\" maid, where an adult male dresses in cartoonish female clothing and performs stereotypical female chores such as housecleaning or serving tea. It should be noted that cross-dressing in D/s does not always involve a desire to be sissified or made into caricatures of women or to serve: for example, others may desire to be made as beautiful as possible and interact on a \"girlfriend-to-girlfriend\" non-sexual basis.\n\nVariation in D/s is virtually limitless and the activities take many forms, and may be combined with other forms of BDSM. These variations may include:\n\nThere are some risks commonly associated with D/s. Because it is mostly a mental activity, many of the risks associated with D/s involve mental health. Others involve abuses of the trust inherent in a D/s relationship. Some examples are:\n\nConsent is a vital element in all psychological play, and consent can be granted in many ways. Some employ a written form known as a \"Dungeon negotiation form\", for others a simple verbal commitment is sufficient. Consent can be limited both in duration and content.\n\nConsensual non-consensuality is a mutual agreement to act as if consent has been waived within safe, sane limits. It is an agreement that consent is given in advance, sometimes without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned, though within defined limits subject to a safeword, reasonable care, common sense, or other restrictions. The consent is given with the intent of its being irrevocable under normal circumstances. As such, it is a show of extreme trust and understanding and is usually undertaken only by partners who know each other well, or otherwise agree to set clear, safe limits on their activities.\n\nIt's not unusual to grant consent only for an hour or for an evening. When a scene lasts for more than a few hours, it's common to draft a \"scene contract\" that defines what will happen and who is responsible for what. It's a good way to work out what all the parties want, and usually improves the experience. Some contracts can become quite detailed and run for many pages, especially if a scene is to last a weekend or more.\n\nFor long term consent, a \"slave contract\" may be drawn up. BDSM \"contracts\" are only an agreement between consenting people and are usually not legally binding; in fact, the possession of one may be considered illegal in some areas. Slave contracts are simply a way of defining the nature and limits of the relationship and are not intended to carry legal force.\n\nAfter a slave contract is drafted, some celebrate the event with a \"collaring ceremony\", in which the local D/s community is invited to witness the commitment made in the document. Some ceremonies become quite elaborate, and can be as involved as a wedding or any similar ritual.\n\nSome people maintain a special room or area, called a dungeon, which contains special equipment (shackles, handcuffs, whips, queening stools, and spanking benches or a Berkley horse, for example) used for play scenes, or they may visit a BDSM club that maintains such facilities.\n\nMany submissives wear a collar to denote their status and commitment. It can be much like a wedding band, except that only the submissive partner wears one. The traditional collar is a neck band in leather or metal, chosen, designed, and even crafted by the dominant partner. Some subs wear a \"symbolic collar\", often a bracelet or ankle chain, which is more subdued than the traditional collar and can pass in non-BDSM situations. It is not uncommon for a sub to have several collars for special occasions. Dog collars are integral for K-9 roleplaying—pup-play.\n\nMany people—for example, some in the punk rock and goth subcultures—wear collars for other reasons, such as fashion. So, one cannot assume that all people wearing collars are involved in BDSM. Members of the furry fandom may also wear collars as a part of costuming or as fashion. Use of collars in the sexual aspects of furry lifestyle may or may not be connected to BDSM, depending on the individual's preferences.\n\nOne of the most famous works in this area is Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's \"Venus im Pelz\" (\"Venus in Furs\", 1869), in which the protagonist, Severin, persuades a woman, Wanda, to take him on as her slave, serves her, and allows her to degrade him. The book has elements of both social and physical submission, and is the genesis of the term \"masochism\" coined by the 19th century psychiatrist Krafft-Ebing.\n\n\nThe Velvet Underground's song \"Venus In Furs\" is based on Sacher-Masoch's novel and discusses sadomasochism, the character Severin, and common bondage practices in a detached, objective, and non-judgmental manner.\n\nThe Rolling Stones song \"Under my Thumb\" (M. Jagger, 1966) is supposedly about a D/s relationship.\n\nThe Green Day song \"All By Myself/Dominated Love Slave\" (written and sung by Tré Cool) describes Cool's feelings for female dominance.\n\nDwele's \"Obey\" is a Neo-Soul song based on the mind of a Dominant in a D/s relationship.\n\nThe Run The Jewels song \"Love Again (Akinyele Back)\" is a 2014 hip-hop release with verses about sexual dominance by Killer Mike, El-P and Gangsta Boo.\n\nThe Rihanna song \"S&M\" denotes the artist's arousal in BDSM play.\n\nThe DNCE song \"Be Mean\" is written about the artist's desire to be dominated.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9638", "title": "Epimenides paradox", "text": "Epimenides paradox\n\nThe Epimenides paradox reveals a problem with self-reference in logic.\n\nIt is named after the Cretan philosopher Epimenides of Knossos (alive circa 600 BC) who is credited with the original statement.\n\nA typical description of the problem is given in the book \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", by Douglas Hofstadter:\n\nA paradox of self-reference arises when one considers whether it is possible for Epimenides to have spoken the truth.\n\nThomas Fowler (1869) states the paradox as follows: \"Epimenides the Cretan says, 'that all the Cretans are liars,' but Epimenides is himself a Cretan; therefore he is himself a liar. But if he is a liar, what he says is untrue, and consequently the Cretans are veracious; but Epimenides is a Cretan, and therefore what he says is true; saying the Cretans are liars, Epimenides is himself a liar, and what he says is untrue. Thus we may go on alternately proving that Epimenides and the Cretans are truthful and untruthful.\"\n\nThe Epimenides paradox in this form, however, can be solved. There are two options: it is either true or false. First, assume that it is true, but then Epimenides, being a Cretan, would be a liar, and making the assumption that liars only make false statements, the statement is false. So, assuming the statement is true leads us to conclude that the statement is false. This is a contradiction, so the option of the statement being true is not possible. This leaves the second option: that it is false.\n\nIf we assume the statement is false and that Epimenides is lying about all Cretans being liars, then there must exist at least one Cretan who is honest. This does not lead to contradiction since it is not required that this Cretan be Epimenides. This means that Epimenides can say the false statement that all Cretans are liars while knowing at least one honest Cretan and lying about this particular Cretan. Hence, from the assumption that the statement is false, it does not follow that the statement is true. So we can avoid a paradox as seeing the statement \"all Cretans are liars\" as a false statement, which is made by a lying Cretan, Epimenides. The mistake made by Thomas Fowler (and many other people) above is to think that the negation of \"all Cretans are liars\" is \"all Cretans are honest\" (a paradox) when in fact the negation is \"there exists a Cretan who is honest\", or \"not all Cretans are liars\". The Epimenides paradox can be slightly modified as to not allow the kind of solution described above, as it was in the first paradox of Eubulides but instead leading to a non-avoidable self-contradiction. Paradoxical versions of the Epimenides problem are closely related to a class of more difficult logical problems, including the liar paradox, Socratic paradox, and the Burali-Forti paradox, all of which have self-reference in common with Epimenides. Indeed, the Epimenides paradox is usually classified as a variation on the liar paradox, and sometimes the two are not distinguished. The study of self-reference led to important developments in logic and mathematics in the twentieth century.\n\nIn other words, it is not a paradox once one realizes \"All Cretans are liars\" being untrue only means \"Not all Cretans are liars\" instead of the assumption that \"All Cretans are honest\".\n\nPerhaps better put, for \"All Cretans are liars\" to be a true statement, it does not mean that all Cretans must lie all the time. In fact Cretans could tell the truth quite often but still all be liars in the sense that liars are people prone to deception for dishonest gain. Considering that “All Cretans are liars” has been seen as a paradox only since the 19th century, this seems to resolve the alleged paradox. Of course if ‘all Cretans are continuous liars’ is actually true, then asking a Cretan if they are honest would always elicit the dishonest answer ‘yes’. So arguably the original proposition is not so much paradoxical as invalid. \n\nA contextual reading of the contradiction may also provide an answer to the paradox. The original phrase, \"The Cretans, always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies!\" asserts not an intrinsic paradox, but rather an opinion of the Cretans from Epimenides. A stereotyping of his people not intended to be an absolute statement about the people as a whole. Rather it is a claim made about their position regarding their religious beliefs and socio-cultural attitudes. Within the context of his poem the phrase is specific to a certain belief, a context that Callimachus repeats in his poem regarding Zeus. Further, a more poignant answer to the paradox is simply that to be a \"liar\" is to state falsehoods, nothing in the statement asserts everything said is false, but rather they're \"always\" lying. This is not an absolute statement of fact and thus we cannot conclude there's a true contradiction made by Epimenides with this statement.\n\nEpimenides was a 6th-century BC philosopher and religious prophet who, against the general sentiment of Crete, proposed that Zeus was immortal, as in the following poem:\nDenying the immortality of Zeus, then, was the lie of the Cretans.\n\nThe phrase \"Cretans, always liars\" was quoted by the poet Callimachus in his \"Hymn to Zeus\", with the same theological intent as Epimenides:\n\nThe logical inconsistency of a Cretan asserting all Cretans are always liars may not have occurred to Epimenides, nor to Callimachus, who both used the phrase to emphasize their point, without irony, perhaps meaning that all Cretans lie routinely, but not exclusively.\n\nIn the 1st century AD, the quote is mentioned by Paul as having been spoken truly by \"one of their own prophets.\"\n\nClement of Alexandria, in the late 2nd century AD, fails to indicate that the concept of logical paradox is an issue:\n\nDuring the early 4th century, Saint Augustine restates the closely related liar paradox in \"Against the Academicians\" (III.13.29), but without mentioning Epimenides.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, many forms of the liar paradox were studied under the heading of insolubilia, but these were not explicitly associated with Epimenides.\n\nFinally, in 1740, the second volume of Pierre Bayle's \"Dictionnaire Historique et Critique\" explicitly connects Epimenides with the paradox, though Bayle labels the paradox a \"sophisme\".\n\nAll of the works of Epimenides are now lost, and known only through quotations by other authors. The quotation from the \"Cretica\" of Epimenides is given by R.N. Longenecker, \"Acts of the Apostles\", in volume 9 of \"The Expositor's Bible Commentary\", Frank E. Gaebelein, editor (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Corporation, 1976–1984), page 476. Longenecker in turn cites M.D. Gibson, \"Horae Semiticae X\" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1913), page 40, \"in Syriac\". Longenecker states the following in a footnote:\n\nAn oblique reference to Epimenides in the context of logic appears in \"The Logical Calculus\" by W. E. Johnson, \"Mind\" (New Series), volume 1, number 2 (April, 1892), pages 235–250. Johnson writes in a footnote,\n\nThe Epimenides paradox appears explicitly in \"Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types\", by Bertrand Russell, in the \"American Journal of Mathematics\", volume 30, number 3 (July, 1908), pages 222–262, which opens with the following:\n\nIn that article, Russell uses the Epimenides paradox as the point of departure for discussions of other problems, including the Burali-Forti paradox and the paradox now called Russell's paradox. Since Russell, the Epimenides paradox has been referenced repeatedly in logic. Typical of these references is \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" by Douglas Hofstadter, which accords the paradox a prominent place in a discussion of self-reference.\n"}

Her doctoral thesis was in French literature, discussing the work of Armand Robin. She later wrote another thesis on the work on François-Marie Luzel.\n\nHer subsequent works typically fall into five different areas of literature:\n\nHer translation of Eugene O'Neill's \"Desire Under the Elms\" led her to translate other dramatic literature, such as John Millington Synge and parts Seán O'Casey. She has also created new translations of Chekhov and Shakespeare in collaboration with André Markowicz. She won the 2006 Molière prize for best theatrical adaptation with André Markowicz for her version of Chekhov's \"Platonov\", directed by Alain Francon.\n\nShe also creates shows for Breton theatre troupes, notably \"Le Pain des âmes, D'un Buisson de ronces\" (\"Spiritual Bread: of a Thornbush\"). She also adapted the myth of \"Sainte Tryphine et le roi Arthur\" (\"Saint Tryphine and King Arthur\") from the writings of Luzel.\n\nShe published editions of the works of Armand Robin, including his manuscripts, which she first published in their full original form, which had previously been truncated.\n\nShe has also published the prose works of François-Marie Luzel (eighteen volumes) by scrupulously adhering to Luzel's manuscripts, given in facsimile and always giving the original text where they exist in both the French and Breton languages (Tales of Brittany, Rennes University Press).\n\nShe has also published works by Danielle Collobert, and has contributed over a hundred prefaces, articles and essays to scholarly editions of poetry and literature.\n\nShe has also published translations of Marie de France and the poems of Sylvia Plath.\n\n\"La Gavotte du mille pattes\" (The thousand footed gavotte) was the first of her books of songs, followed by books of stories \"La Femme du loup gris\" (The Woman of the gray wolf), \"L'École des loisirs\" (School of recreation) and \"Lutins et lutines\" (Elves and goblins). She worked in collaboration with illustrators.\n\nEditing Luzel led her to continue her research in the folklore of the fantastic and supernatural, especially fairies and elves, as in \"Vie et mœurs des lutins Bretons\" (Life and manners of Breton elves) and \"La douce vie des fées des eaux\" (The sweet life of water-fairies). She considered authentic folk traditions to be an increasingly frail barrier against the commercialization of folklore. She aspired to authenticity by basing her studies on journals giving precise references and citing them specifically in the texts, while including her own form of humour and poetry based on these sources.\n\nShe has expanded her work in folklore beyond Brittany to France as a whole and initiated the series \"The Great Collections\" published by \"Ouest-France\": it has published the folk-story collections of Jean-François Blade (Gascony), of Amélie Bosquet (Normandy) and Henry Carnoy (Picardy).\n\nFrançoise Morvan has published a provisional autobiographical memoir, which is subtitled \"drifting identity and nationalism in Brittany\". She has published on the same theme an article which was reproduced by the Breton Information Group (Groupe information Bretagne, or GRIB), which she helped to found. She defended linguist François Falc'hun from numerous \"telephone harassment campaigns\" by Breton nationalists.\n\nHer memoir \"Le Monde comme si\" (The world as if) caused controversy in Brittany bewcause of its attacks on the Breton regionalist movement (emsav). She discusses the arguments about the authenticity of \"Barzaz Breiz\", the cultural and political movements in Brittany, their attitude during World War II, the creation of the unified Breton spelling, the Cultural Institute of Brittany, the subsidies given for the Breton language, the Flag of Brittany, among other things.\n\n"}

Although the term can in some contexts refer to either positive or negative crowd reactions, heat is usually used specifically to mean a negative crowd response (booing etc.), with its opposite being a \"pop\" or positive reaction (cheering, clapping, etc.). \n\nAs heat typically refers to a negative reaction that a wrestling character gets from a crowd in a performance setting, it has also become slang for a negative reaction that a wrestler gets backstage from colleagues, management or both. Backstage heat can be garnered for both real and perceived slights and transgressions.\n\nHeels can draw \"cheap heat\" (called \"cheap\" because it is an easy way for the villains to receive boos) by blatantly insulting the fans, a local sports team, or the town in which they are performing. Fan favorites would sometimes do the equivalent, referred to as a \"cheap pop\", by referring to the town (which Mick Foley popularized) or promising to \"win one for the fans\". The villains can also draw cheap heat by referring to a mainstream news event as part of their promo, especially if the event has strongly emotional or political ramifications (e.g. a natural disaster), although they sometimes do not mention it by name. Historically, another common practice of villains to draw cheap heat involves using racial and ethnic slurs to offend the collective sensibility of wrestling fans. For example, in 1972, when the American Indian Movement was gaining momentum, Baron von Raschke was known to refer to Native American WWA World Heavyweight Champion Billy Red Cloud as a \"dirty low down Injun\" as a means of drawing cheap heat.\n\nAnother example of a wrestler using cheap heat was Sgt. Slaughter, who often delivered anti-American promos during the Gulf War (and Operation Desert Shield immediately before it) as part of his Iraqi sympathizer gimmick; one of those promos came at the 1990 Survivor Series, where Slaughter insulted servicemen stationed in Iraq for Thanksgiving. In 2003, The Rock used the Lakers-Kings rivalry to gain cheap heat during a WWE Raw show in Sacramento (The Rock even claimed that he was friends with Laker star Shaquille O'Neal) when he was singing a song about leaving the city; the song's last lyrics were: \"I'll be sure to come back when the Lakers beat the Kings in May.\" In 2004 during a WWE live event in Germany, John Bradshaw Layfield used Nazi salutes and was booed heavily by the crowd. In April 2006 during his feud with Shawn Michaels, Mr. McMahon used religion and the city to get heat from the crowd in St. Louis, Missouri by saying he went to hell that morning when his driver \"got lost and ended up in East St. Louis\".\n\nMore recent examples include CM Punk and Paul Heyman in March 2013 mocking through displays of flippancy and disrespect towards Paul Bearer (who had just died), stealing his trademark urn and with Punk going as far as assaulting The Undertaker and constantly beat him with the urn (with Heyman being dressed up as Bearer) before then boldly opened the urn and emptied its contents over a fallen Undertaker. In November 2015, Paige mocked then Divas Champion Charlotte about her late younger brother Reid.\n\n\"Canned heat\" refers to playing a recording of cheering or booing through the arena sound system or adding it to a taped show, to either amplify a crowd reaction or mask silence from the crowd. Pre-taped crowd reactions from other events are also spliced in with the programming to make the crowd look more energetic than it actually is, or if promoters want a storyline to go in a particular direction.\n\nFor example, in early 1992 the World Wrestling Federation was attempting to push Sid Justice as a villain. During the Royal Rumble match in January, Justice – who had become popular due to his charisma – was loudly cheered when he eliminated Hulk Hogan, and commentators Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan and Gorilla Monsoon picked up on this as a fair act. However, the reaction was edited in future television replays, with Sid being booed heavily and Monsoon describing him as a \"jerk.\"\n\nBefore \"SmackDown\" went live in 2016, WWE usually overdubbed cheers on it and professional wrestling magazine \"Power Slam\" joked that the company has had to \"fire up the Fake Crowd Roar Machine™ to add an artificial atmosphere\".\n\n\"Go home heat\" (sometimes called \"go away heat\" or \"nuclear heat\") occurs when fans boo or jeer a legitimately disliked character or, sometimes, the wrestler playing that character. Go home heat can be given to wrestlers who are viewed negatively, either for their booking, their character, or even their actions outside of the show; thus, both heroes and villains can get this kind of heat. However, nuclear heat can also mean a heel character getting genuine disdain from fans, simply from great character work. This is much less common in the present day, as fans may be more clued in to the inner workings of professional wrestling, and this type of heat is transformed into a pop. This is due to smarks realizing how good the character work is, and cheering instead of booing.\n\nGenerally speaking, go home heat happens either because the fans feel the promotion has been too aggressively pushing a certain wrestler (regardless of his character alignment) who they feel is undeserving of their push, or because the character has become stale, boring, and uninteresting. While it can be difficult to distinguish the good heat for the villain from go away heat, with some fans and critics claiming it is indeed go away heat and others claiming it is good heat, there are a few example which are closer to be go away heat, most notably in WWE because of its major exposure. Notorious examples of the concept are The Rock as Rocky Maivia, X-Pac (who popularized the term in the early 2000s so much that go away heat is also known as \"X-Pac heat\"), Triple H, John Bradshaw Layfield, Stephanie McMahon, and more recently Roman Reigns (see Persona and reception of Roman Reigns).\n\nBetween 1996 and 1997, Rocky Maivia was the first major example of go away heat and also the best example of turning the go away heat into a star by 1998. Hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler, Maivia was a clean-cut heroic character who was pushed heavily from the start and won the Intercontinental Championship despite his wrestling inexperience. This was during a transitional, but more edgy period that would lead to the Attitude Era, therefore audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of \"Die, Rocky, die!\" and \"Rocky sucks!\" being heard during his matches. After suffering a legit injury in April 1997, Maivia would return as a villain character in August 1997 by joining the Nation of Domination and refusing to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as The Rock, insulting the audience in his promos as well as WWF television interviewers. The Rock would eventually become the Nation's leader and draw good heat, then starting getting cheered while still being a villain before being officially turned back into a fan favorite character by September 1998. During his time in the Nation, The Rock would get back the Intercontinental Championship and held it for 265 days (the second longest in the 1990s and the longest ever since), with his second reign being better reviewed and the ladder match in which he lost the title to Triple H at SummerSlam being rated ****1/4 out of five stars by journalist Dave Meltzer of \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" (\"WON\").\n\nDespite now getting the desired reaction, the WWF would turn him back into a villain (from November 1998 to April 1999) to feud with Mankind (Mick Foley) and become the top villain to main event WrestleMania XV as WWF Champion and drop the title to the company's \"poster boy\" Stone Cold Steve Austin. In April 1999, The Rock would turn back into a heroic character and would become one of the most successful characters of both the Attitude Era and WWE history. Despite getting some mixed reactions and being booed a few times in 2001 and 2002, most notably against Austin in the main event of WrestleMania X-Seven at Austin's homestate, \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8 and Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam, The Rock would never draw go away heat and would instead use both the fans turning on him and him getting more successful in his actor career to turn back into a villain in 2003 to end his full-time career, before becoming once again a fan favorite ever since 2004.\n\nDespite this occurring during the Invasion, where the WWF side was mostly portrayed as the heroes, the fans were vocal in their disapproval of X-Pac, which was acknowledged on-screen by both Alliance member Billy Kidman and later by WWF member Edge.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2001, Triple H had a successful run as the main villain of the WWF—especially in 2000, when he became the first villain to win the main event of WrestleMania and thus retain the WWF Championship, as well as winning the \"Feud of the Year\" award by both \"PWI\" (with Kurt Angle) and \"WON\" (with Mick Foley) and the \"WON\" \"Wrestler of the Year\" award due his accomplishments and performances. Dave Meltzer would rank Triple H's drawing power as the number one of the 2000s.\n\nHowever, by late 2002 he would be criticized for the Katie Vick angle with Kane, with his following feuds with Scott Steiner and Booker T being criticized as well. Thus his \"reign of terror\" with the World Heavyweight Championship (he was the inaugural holder, being awarded the title by Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff in September 2002) by December 2002 to September 2003 would often being described as go away heat due his mediocre angles and matches.\n\nAs result of his go away heat, between 2002 and 2004 Triple H would win the \"Worst Feud of the Year\" with Kane (including the \"Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic\"), as well as the \"Worst Worked Match of the Year\" (with Scott Steiner in January 2003) and being voted by \"WON\"'s readers as the \"Most Overrated\" (2002–2004) and the \"Readers' Least Favorite Wrestler\" (2002 and 2003). It would stay with him despite getting in a better phsycal condition and thus having better matches and feuds by 2004—due him winning the title five times for a total of 616 days—until he put over Batista (whose storyline building and eventual feud was high acclaimed, winning the \"WON\" \"Feud of the Year\" award) at WrestleMania 21, Backlash and Vengeance. After his Hell in a Cell match with Batista at Vengeance, Triple H was given a standing ovation. Triple H would be getting cheered during his feud with Cena in 2006 despite still being a villain, which would lead to his return as a fan favorite.\n\nJohn Bradshaw Layfield's push in 2004 that would change him from a predominantly tag team division competitor to a SmackDown main eventer who went on to hold the WWE Championship for 280 days (the longest reign in a decade) is often seen as go away heat due the push being perceived as forced and undeserving. It was noted that Layfield's push came at a time where SmackDown's talent roster was short of heel main eventers due to Brock Lesnar leaving the company and Kurt Angle due once again suffering from legitimate neck problems. It came to light that then-reigning WWE Champion and top babyface Eddie Guerrero felt a lot of pressure as he felt he was responsible for the drop in crowd attendance at SmackDown's live events at the time and wanted to drop the title. Layfield would not improve things on SmackDown during his reign and actually drew even less than Guerrero. Furthermore, Layfield's matches on pay-per-view were not well received, including his WrestleMania 21 match with John Cena in which he lost the title. However, the subsequent rematch between Layfield and Cena in an \"I Quit\" match at Judgment Day was better received.\n\nAs a villainess, Stephanie McMahon has been able to draw many boos, but her run with The Authority from 2013 to 2016, as well as her run as Raw Commissioner, has been criticized and critics and fans alike saw her heat during this period as go away heat.\n\nHulk Hogan, the face of the WWF that would lead to a boom in professional wrestling during the 1980s, may be included as well due receiving less positive reactions by the early 1990s, including the Sid incident at the 1992 Royal Rumble, even getting some boos, especially in his early years with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). This was mostly due a stale character, which was turned as a villain in July 1996, becoming the leader of the New World Order (nWo) and eventually turning back into a fan favorite in 1999.\n\nCuriously, the last two WWE wrestlers billed as \"the face of the company\" or \"the top guy\" (John Cena and Roman Reigns) have been linked to have had go away heat, as both have in common the fact to be billed as heroic characters and staying as such despite getting jeers for years, unlike Rocky Maivia who was turned into a villain less than a year after his failed run as fan favorite. Cena had a brief run as a villain between late 2002 and late 2003, when he was turned back into a fan favorite to acclaim, much like The Rock in 1998. Cena would also win his first world title to a pop from the crowd, eventually surpassing Batista's popularity in 2005 that would see him being moved from SmackDown to the Raw brand. By mid-2005, due a change of character not appreciated by fans that would see Cena changing from \"The Doctor of Thuganomics\" (a rapper) to a more clean-cut character (described by Cena as a \"goody-two shoes Superman\") who would often \"overcome the odds\", thus getting his first boos and jeers. In the following years, Cena would get mostly real \"mixed reaction\" rather than go away heat, oftentimes still getting more cheers than boos, with the notorious exception of Rob Van Dam's Money in the Bank cash-in at ECW's One Night Stand (with ECW being Van Dam's \"home promotion\"), Tables, Ladders and Chairs match against Edge at Unforgiven in Edge's hometown and against CM Punk at Money in the Bank in CM Punk's hometown. Eventually, by the 2010s he would be revaluted (ironically, also due Reigns being described as \"even worse\") and getting more cheers, especially during his run as United States Champion in 2015 and even when winning his 16th world championship against popular and respected veteran AJ Styles at the Royal Rumble in January 2017.\n\nReigns, while actually debuting on WWE's main roster as a villain in November 2012, would never actually have a villain single run due debuting as part of The Shield. By late 2013, Reigns would be getting the biggest push between the three members of The Shield (Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins), as he got to win as sole survivor his Survivor Series 5-on-5 elimination match and the most elimination at 4, being the only member of The Shield to defeat CM Punk and breaking another record at the Royal Rumble for the most elimination in a single Royal Rumble match at 12, also eliminating both Ambrose and Rollins from the match and ending up being the runner-up (Reigns would get cheered over eventual winner Batista, as fans wanted fan favorite and popoular Daniel Bryan to win instead of Batista), being eventually billed as the leader of The Shield during their feud with Evolution (Batista, Randy Orton and Triple H) between April and May 2014. After The Shield broke up in June 2014, the heroic Ambrose and the now villain Rollins would change their ring attire and theme music (unlike Reigns, who retained much of The Shield's aesthetic including ring attire, a remixed version of the group's theme music and ring entrance), eventually evolving their characters during their high acclaimed feud that won the \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" (\"PWI\") award for the \"Best Feud\". While Ambrose was being voted by \"PWI\"'s reader as the \"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\" in 2014 and 2015 and Rollins as both the \"Wrestler of the Year\" and the \"Most Hated Wrestler of the Year\" in 2015, Reigns had finished in second place for the \"WON\" \"Most Overrated\" award in both 2014 and 2015. When breaking up The Shield, WWE thought Reigns was the most popular between the three and thus pushed Reigns in the main event, immediately going after the world title. However, as soon as his singles career on WWE's main roster started, Reigns' positive reactions started to diminish, culminating in Orton getting cheered over him during their match at SummerSlam. After suffering a legit incarcerated hernia in September 2014, Reigns' positive crowd reactions following his return in December further diminished, culminating in Reigns \"getting booed out of the building\" after winning the 2015 Royal Rumble.\n\nFor those arguing that Reigns is getting go away heat, their reason is due his perceived forced push, as he would headline WrestleMania 31 after wrestling only two singles matches on pay-per-view despite having a \"very limited\" in-ring moveset, \"forced promo delivery\" and a \"petulant and annoyed\" attitude ill-befitting of a top fan favorite. Reigns' first coronation was set to happen in the main event of WrestleMania 31, but WWE ultimately decided to go with Rollins chashing-in his Money in the Bank contract and win the title to avoid further negative reactions towards Reigns. Reigns would eventually win three world titles and two consecutive WrestleMania main events (against Triple H at WrestleMania 32 and The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33) despite the continuing negative reactions by both critics and fans alike, which has led \"PWI\" readers to vote him as \"Most Hated Wrestler of the Year\" for 2016, a first for a heroic character since the award was devised in 1972. It should also be noted that \"business went up\" with Cena, who has been also one of the best merchandising seller in WWE history, whereas the period in which WWE tried to push Reigns as the new face of the company and gave him multiple coronations at WrestleMania saw a much quickly decline in \"Raw\" viewership by late 2015, when Reigns was made the number one contender for the world title in October and eventually winning the title three times between November and April 2016.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2418846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2418846", "title": "Indo-Pakistani Sign Language", "text": "Indo-Pakistani Sign Language\n\nIndo-Pakistani Sign Language (IPSL) is the predominant sign language in South Asia, used by at least several hundred thousand deaf signers (2003). As with many sign languages, it is difficult to estimate numbers with any certainty, as the Census of India does not list sign languages and most studies have focused on the north and on urban areas.\n\nThe Indian deaf population of 1.1 million is 98% illiterate. In line with oralist philosophy, deaf schools attempt early intervention with hearing aids etc., but these are largely dysfunctional in an impoverished society. As of 1986, only 2% of deaf children attended school. \n\nPakistan has a deaf population of 0.24 million, which is approximately 7.4% of the overall disabled population in the country.\n\nDeaf schools in the region are overwhelmingly oralist in their approach.\nUnlike American Sign Language (ASL) and sign languages of European countries, ISL is in rudimentary stage of its development. The Deaf communities of India are still struggling for ISL to gain the status of sign language as a minority language. Though sign language is used by many deaf people in India, it is not used officially in schools for teaching purposes.In 2005, India the National Curricular Framework (NCF) gave some degree of legitimacy to sign language education, by hinting that sign languages may qualify as an optional third language choice for hearing students. NCERT in March 2006 launched a class III text includes a chapter on sign language, emphasising the fact that it is a language like any other and is \"yet another mode of communication.\" The aim was to create healthy attitudes towards the differently abled.\nMany efforts have been made by the Deaf communities, NGO's, researchers and other organisations working for deaf people, including All India Federation of Deaf (AIFD), National association of the Deaf (NAD) in the direction of encouraging ISL.Until 2001, no formal classes for teaching ISL were conducted in India. During this period, Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing Handicapped (AYJNIHH), Mumbai, established ISL cell. It started a course \"Diploma in Sign Language Interpreter Course\". The curriculum designed for the course aims to develop professional communicative competence in Sign language and ability to interpret professionally. It also focused on the basic understanding of Deaf community and Deaf culture. Later, the course was offered in the regional centres in Hyderabad, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata and Delhi.\nBesides AYJNIHH, organisations like Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore and several other organisations are offering ISL classes. Many NGO's all over the India use ISL to teach English and various academic and vocational courses. These include ISHARA, Mumbai; Deaf Way Foundation, Delhi; Noida Deaf Society; Leadership Education Empowerment of Deaf (LEED), Pune; Speaking Hands Institute for the Deaf, Punjab, etc. (Randhawa, 2014) . The associations like Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) and Indian Sign Language Interpreters Association (ISLIA) were established in 2006 and 2008 respectively for the professional development of Interpreters in India.\nThe two schools have been established in India which is following bilingual approach to teach deaf students. One is Bajaj Institute of Learning (BIL) in Dehradun and the other is Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore. \nApart from the establishment of organisations working for Deaf people there has been a spurt in research on sign language in India. Recent additions are the research studies by research scholars of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and University of Delhi including Wallang, 2007 ; Sinha,2003,2008/2013 ; Hidam,2010 ; Kulsheshtra, 2013 . There is also work on problems and awareness of ISL and typology of ISL verbs (Morgan 2009,2010) . Apart from these there have been continued works by scholars on linguistic aspects of ISL as well as on varieties of ISL (Bhattacharya and Hidam 2010, Aboh, Pfau, and Zeshan 2005, Zeshan and Panda 2011, Panda 2011, Panda 2012).\nThe earnest step taken by the Government of India to promote sign language was establishment of the ISLRTC. However, currently the autonomy of the Research centre is a contentious issue, yet to be resolved.\n\nThere are many varieties of sign language in the region, including many pockets of home sign and local sign languages, such as Ghandruk Sign Language, Jhankot Sign Language, and Jumla Sign Language in Nepal, and Alipur Sign Language in India, which appear to be language isolates. There are also various Sri Lankan sign languages which may not even be related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal (Nepalese Sign Language), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for Nepalese Sign Language at least, it is not clear whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the sign system in ISL appears to be largely indigenous, elements in ISL are derived from British Sign Language. For example, most ISL signers nowadays use fingerspelling based on British Sign Language fingerspelling, with only isolated groups using an indigenous devanagari-based fingerspelling system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in Vadodara/Baroda, Gujarat). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from American Sign Language. A small number of the Deaf in and around Bengaluru are often said to use American Sign Language (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct to say that they use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or Signed English), while incorporating also a not inconsequential ISL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly ISL and not ASL.\n\nThe Delhi Association for the Deaf is reportedly working with Jawaharlal Nehru University to identify a standard sign language for India.\n\nAlthough discussion of sign languages and the lives of deaf people is extremely rare in the history of South Asian literature, there are a few references to deaf people and gestural communication in texts dating from antiquity. Symbolic hand gestures known as mudras have been employed in religious contexts in Hinduism, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism for many centuries, although these religious traditions have often excluded deaf people from participation in ritual or religious membership. In addition, classical Indian dance and theatre often employs stylised hand gestures with particular meanings.\n\nAn early reference to gestures used by deaf people for communication appears in a 12th-century Islamic legal commentary, the Hidayah. In the influential text, deaf (or \"dumb\") people have legal standing in areas such as bequests, marriage, divorce and financial transactions, if they communicate habitually with intelligible signs.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, a high incidence of deafness was observed among communities of the Naga hills. As has happened elsewhere in such circumstances (see, for example, Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language), a village sign language had emerged and was used by both deaf and hearing members of the community. Ethnologist and political officer John Henry Hutton wrote:\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that any of these sign systems are related to modern IPSL, and deaf people were largely treated as social outcasts throughout South Asian history.\n\nDocumented deaf education began with welfare services, mission schools and orphanages from the 1830s, and \"initially worked with locally-devised gestural or signed communication, sometimes with simultaneous speech.\" Later in the 19th century, residential deaf schools were established, and they tended (increasingly) to adopt an oralist approach over the use of sign language in the classroom. These schools included The Bombay Institution for Deaf-Mutes, which was founded by Bishop Leo Meurin in the 1880s, and schools in Madras and Calcutta which opened in the 1890s. Other residential schools soon followed, such as the \"School for Deaf and Dumb Boys\" at Mysore, founded in 1902, a school in Dehiwala in what is now Sri Lanka, founded in 1913, and \"The Ida Rieu School for blind, deaf, dumb and other defective children\", founded in 1923 in Karachi, in what is now Pakistan.\n\nWhile a few students who were unable to learn via the oralist method were taught with signs, many students preferred to communicate with each other via sign language, sometimes to the frustration of their teachers. The first study of the sign language of these children, which is almost certainly related to modern IPSL, was in 1928 by British teacher H. C. Banerjee. She visited three residential schools for deaf children, at Dacca, Barisal and Calcutta, observing that \"in all these schools the teachers have discouraged the growth of the sign language, which in spite of this official disapproval, has grown and flourished.\" She compared sign vocabularies at the different schools and described the signs in words in an appendix.\n\nA rare case of a public event conducted in sign language was reported by a mission in Palayamkottai in 1906: \"Our services for the Deaf are chiefly in the sign language, in which all can join alike, whether learning Tamil, as those do who belong to the Madras Presidency, or English, which is taught to those coming from other parts.\"\n\nDespite the common assumption that Indian Sign Language is the manual representation of spoken English or Hindi, it is in fact unrelated to either language and has its own grammar. Zeshan (2014) discusses three aspects of ISL: its lexicon, syntax and spatial grammar. Some distinct features of ISL that differ from other sign languages include:\n\n1) Number Signs: The numbers from zero to nine are formed in ISL by holding up a hand with the appropriate handshape for each number. From one to five the corresponding number of extended fingers forms the numeral sign, whereas for zero and the numbers from six to nine special handshapes are used that derive from written numbers. Ten may either be expressed by two 5-hands or by ‘1+0’. (Zeshan, 2000)\n\n2) Family Relationship: The signs for family relationship are preceded by the sign for ‘male/man’ and ‘female/woman’.\n\nE.g.: \n\n3) Sign families: Several signs belong to same family if they share one or more parameters including handshapes, place of articulation and movement.\n\nE.g.: \n\n4) The ISL consists of various non-manual gestures including mouth pattern, mouth gesture, facial expression, body posture, head position and eye gaze (Zeshan, 2001)\n\n5) There is no temporal inflection in ISL. The past, present and future is depicted by using signs for before, then, and after.\n\n6) The question words like WHAT, WHERE, WHICH, HOW etc. are placed at the end of interrogative sentences.\n\n7) The use of space is a crucial feature of ISL.\n\nIndian Sign language has appeared in numerous Indian films such as:\n\n\nIchalkaranj, India: Deaf Foundation.\nSinha, Samar (2005), A Skeletal Grammar of Indian Sign Language, MPhil dissertation.

{"id": "27582332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27582332", "title": "Ismael Urbain", "text": "Ismael Urbain\n\nIsmael Urbain (born Thomas Urbain, December 31, 1812 – January 28, 1884) was a French journalist and interpreter.\n\nBorn in Cayenne, French Guiana Urbain was the illegitimate son of a merchant from Marseille named Urbain Brue and a free colored woman from French Guiana named Appoline. Ismael who bore his father's first name as his surname, was brought by him to Marseille when he was eight, and there he received an education. In 1830, his father returned him to French Guiana where he hoped that he would turn to business. However, with the pitiful state of his father's affairs, Urbain wasn't allowed back, and the following year he again returned to Marseille.\n\nAfter having discovered Saint-Simonianism, Urbain took the road to Paris where he became the secretary of Gustave d'Eichthal. He was with the Saint-Simonists before embarking with them to the Orient. He took up residence in Damietta in Egypt and taught French there until 1836. The year before he left he converted to Islam and took the name Ismael.\n\nBack in Paris he worked for a time at Édouard Charton's \"Le Magasin pittoresque\", \"Le Temps\", \"la Charte de 1839\" and \"la Revue du XIXe siècle\".\n\nAfter learning Arabic in Egypt he obtained the post of military interpreter in Algeria for which he had applied. He served as interpreter to several generals: Bugeaud, Rumilly and Changarnier. In 1840 he married a young Algerian woman with whom he had a daughter in 1843. His vast knowledge and experience of Islam led him to participate in the Algerian administration at a high level. Having become a member of the Governor General's advisory board he took part in most major decisions in Algeria.\n\nIn 1845, Urbain was summoned to the Ministry of War and he returned to France where his wife was to follow. Unable to conjoin the Muslim family with the French family he resolved to marry his wife before civil status on May 20, 1857, and the next day his daughter who was constantly being teased by her schoolmates at the private school run by Sœurs de la Doctrine Chrétienne in Constantine, was baptized. This act, however, was not enough to appease the Roman Catholic community, made up of Spaniards, Maltese and people from the South of France who composed the new society of colonists in Algeria, who accused him of failing to obtain the blessing of the church for his marriage and the lack of a baptism for his wife.\n\nUrbain has been largely attributed as the source of the arabophilia of Napoleon III to whom he was a personal adviser. He corresponded with many key political, military and cultural people in the Algeria of his time. In an 1857 article in \"Revue de Paris\" Urbain denounced the term \"Kabylie\" as an invention due to the French spirit of systematization used neither by the Arabs nor by the Berbers of Algeria. In 1861 he published under the pen name Georges Voisin \"l’Algérie pour les Algériens\" (\"Algeria for the Algerians\") where he defends the ideas of an Arab Kingdom that Napoleon III, influenced by the ideas of the Saint-Simonists, had wanted to implement at the instigation of Urbain, but which was fiercely opposed by the colonists and economic interests in Algeria. The renewed attacks by Urbain in 1870 in \"l’Algérie française: indigènes et immigrants\" (\"French Algeria: natives and immigrants\") provoked very violent agitation in the colony. The writings of Urbain aroused such passionate reactions that they almost completely overshadowed the ideas which were developed in the ensuing polemics.\n\nUrbain died in Algeria. On his death Émile Masqueray rejoined the fight for the rights of the Algerians against the repressive behavior of the colonists.\n\n\n"}

It is a dialect of Ligurian, and is somewhat similar to Italian.\n\nBecause the Monégasques are only a minority in Monaco, their tongue was threatened with extinction in the 1970s. However, the language is now being taught in schools. In the old part of Monaco, the street signs are marked with Monégasque in addition to French.\n\nDuring his accession ceremonies in 2005, Albert II, Prince of Monaco, made a speech to his people in Monégasque.\n\nStandard Italian is also a major language in Monaco.

{"id": "179401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179401", "title": "Malayalam literature", "text": "Malayalam literature\n\nMalayalam literature () comprises those literary texts written in Malayalam, a South-Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala.\n\nThe earliest known extant literary work in Malayalam is \"Ramacharitam\", an epic poem written by Cheeraman in 1198 CE. In the subsequent centuries, besides a popular \"pattu\" (\"song\") literature, the \"manipravalam\" poetry also flourished. \"Manipravalam\" (translates \"ruby coral\") style mainly consisted of poetry in an admixture of Malayalam and Sanskrit. Then came works such as \"champus\" and \"sandeshakavyas\" in which prose and poetry were interspersed. Later, poets like Cherusseri introduced poems on devotional themes. There were also other important works, similar to \"manipravalam\", in Arabi Malayalam like Muhyadheen Mala. Ezhuthachan, a strong proponent of Bhakti movement, is known as the father of Malayalam. His poems are classified under the genre of \"kilippattu\".\n\nModern literary movements in Malayalam literature began in the late 19th century with the rise of the famous Modern Triumvirate consisting of Kumaran Asan, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer and Vallathol Narayana Menon. Kumaran Asan was temperamentally a pessimist—a disposition reinforced by his metaphysics—yet all his life was active in promoting his downtrodden Hindu-Ezhava community. Ullor wrote in the classical tradition, on the basis of which he appealed for universal love, while Vallathol responded to the human significance of social progress. Contemporary Malayalam poetry records the encounter with problems of social, political, and economic life. The tendency of the modern poetry is often regarded as toward political radicalism. Malayalam spelled backward is still Malayalam.\n\nFor the first 600 years of the Malayalam calendar, Malayalam literature remained in a preliminary stage. During this time, Malayalam literature consisted mainly of various genres of songs (\"Pattu\"). The most prominent among these were songs praising the goddesses of the land, ballads of brave warriors, songs related to the work of a particular caste and songs intended just for entertainment. \"Bhadrakali pattu, thottam pattu,Mappila pattu, mavaratham pattu, sasthanga pattu, nizhalkoothu pattu, sarpa pattu, sastham pattu, thiyyattu pattu, pulluvar pattu, mannar pattu, panar pattu, krishi pattu, thamburan pattu, pada pattu, villadichan pattu, onappattu, kummi\" and lullaby were some of the major subgenres. These names were not used historically, but are used in modern times to describe the song genres of that time.\n\n\"Ramacharitham\" is a collection of poems written at the end of the preliminary stage in Malayalam literature's evolution. It is the oldest Malayalam book available. The collection has 1,814 poems in it. \"Ramacharitham\" mainly consists of stories from the Yuddha Kanda of the \"Ramayana\". It was written by a poet with the pen name \"Cheeramakavi\" who, according to poet Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer, was Sree Veerarama Varman, a king of Travancore from AD 1195 to 1208. Other experts, like Dr. K.M. George and P.V. Krishnan Nair, claim that the origins of the book can be found in north Kerala. They cite the use of certain words in the book and also the fact that the manuscript of the book was recovered from Neeleshwaram in north Kerala. Some experts consider it a Tamil literary piece. A. R. Rajaraja Varma, who heavily contributed to the development of Malayalam grammar, is of the opinion that Malayalam originated from ancient Tamil. \"Ramacharitham\" is considered a book written during the formative years of Malayalam. According to Rev. Dr. Hermann Gundert, who compiled the first dictionary of the Malayalam language, \"Ramacharitham\" shows the ancient style of the Malayalam language.\n\nWhile the \"Pattu\" school flourished among certain sections of the society, the literature of the elite was composed in the curious mixture of Sanskrit and Malayalam which is referred to as \"Manipravalam\", \"mani\" meaning ruby (Malayalam) and \"pravalam\" meaning coral (Sanskrit). \"Lilathilakam\", a work on grammar and rhetoric, written in the last quarter of the 14th century discusses the relationship between \"Manipravalam\" and \"Pattu\" as poetic forms. It lays special emphasis on the types of words that blend harmoniously. It points out that the rules of Sanskrit prosody should be followed in \"Manipravalam\" poetry. This particular school of poetry was patronised by the upper classes, especially the Nambudiris. Dramatic performances given in \"Koothambalams\", known by the names of \"Koothu\" and \"Koodiyattom\", often used Sanskrit and Malayalam. In \"Koodiyattom\", the clown (\"vidooshaka\") is allowed to use Malayalam while the hero recites \"slokas\" in Sanskrit. Tholan, a legendary court poet in the period of the Kulasekhara kings, is believed to have started this practice.\n\nThe earliest of these works in the \"Manipravalam\" school is \"Vaisika Tantram\" written in the 13th century. It contains about 200 quatrains in Sanskrit metres and is in the form of professional advice given to a prostitute or courtesan by her mother. Each quatran is composed with care and due weight is given to the rules of rhetoric. Several quatrains of this type are quoted in \"Lilathilakam\" by way of illustration for the several rules of grammar and rhetoric.\n\nThe most representative of the early \"Manipravalam\" works are the tales of courtesans (\"Achi Charitams\") and the Message Poems (\"Sandesa Kavyas\"). \"Unniyachi Charitam, Unnichiruthevi Charitam\" and \"Unniyadi Charitam\" are examples of the former type which is known by the name \"champu\". The \"Padya\" (verse) portion is in Sanskrit metres and the \"Gadya\" (prose) portion is mostly in Dravidian metres. Authorship of \"Unniyachi Charitam\" and \"Unnichiruthevi Charitam\" is not known and only a portion of the works is now available. \"Unniyadi Charitam\", which also exists in a fragmented form, is supposed to be written by Damodara Chakkiar. The \"Sandesa Kavyas\" are an important poetic genre in Sanskrit, and on the model of Kalidasa's \"Meghadūta\" and Lakshmidasa's \"Sukasandesa\", a number of message poems came to be written first in \"Manipravalam\" and later in pure Malayalam. The best-known among these \"sandesas\" is perhaps \"Unnuneeli Sandesam\" written in the 14th century. The poem is written under the pen-name Amruthanilakshi, and some believe that it was written in 1362 CE. The exact identity of the author remains a mystery, but it is widely believed that one of the members of the Travancore Royal Family wrote it.\n\nThe next work to be mentioned is \"Ramakathapattu\", as it is popularly known, though the author calls it \"Ramayanakavyam\". The author is Ayyappilli Asan who lived sometime about 1400 CE at Auvatutura near Kovalam and whom P. K. Narayana Pillai, who discovered the full text of the book in 1965, calls \"the Homer of Malayalam.\" \"Ramakathapattu\" contains 3163 songs in 279 \"Vrittas\" or parts.\n\nWhile the Manipravala poetry flourished as a diversion from the mainstream, the tradition set up by Cheeraman of \"Ramacharitam\"and the more enlightened among the anonymous folk poets was resumed and replenished by three writers commonly referred to as Niranam poets, being Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar. They were influenced by the Bhakti movement. The \"Bhakti\" school was thus revived, and in the place of the excessive sensuality and eroticism of the \"Manipravalam\" poets, the seriousness of the poetic vocation was reasserted by them. It is believed that they all belonged to the same Kannassa family and that Madhava Panikkar and Sankara Panikkar were the uncles of Rama Panikkar, the youngest of the three. Their most important work is \"Kannasa Ramayanam\" which is an important link between \"Ramacharitam\", \"Ramakathapattu\" and Ezhuthachan's \"Adhyathmaramayanam\". Ulloor has said that Rama Panikkar holds the same position in Malayalam literature that Edmund Spenser has in English literature.\n\nThe 15th century CE saw two paralleled movements in Malayalam literature: one spearheaded by the \"Manipravalam\" works, especially the \"Champus\", and the other emanating from the \"Pattu\" school and adumbrated in Cherusseri's magnum opus, \"Krishnagatha\" (Song of Krishna). The language of the later \"Champus\" reads more like modern Malayalam than that of the earlier \"Champus\" and \"Sandesa Kavyas\". \"Champus\" were mostly works of satire and hyperbole was a regular feature of it. The greatest \"Champus\" of the 15th century is Punam Nambudiri's \"Ramayanam\" which uses Puranic themes and episodes unlike the 14th century \"Champus\" which were tales of the courtesans. Punam also wrote a \"Bharatam Champoo\". There are also many others, the authorship of which is ascribed to him. The later \"Champus\" came to be used for dramatic oral narration by performing artists in their \"Koothu\" and \"Patakam\". Mahishamangalam (or Mazhamangalam) Narayanan Nambudiri who lived in the 16th century is the author of some of the best \"Champus\" of all time. The most widely known of these is \"Naishadham\" followed by \"Rajaratnavaliyam\" and \"Kodia Viraham\". \"Chandrotsavam\", whose authorship is unknown, is a long narrative poem written in \"Manipravalam\".\n\nThe elitist \"Manipravala\" \"Champu\" school disappeared by the end of the 16th century. The average readers without much grounding in Sanskrit had their favourite poems and poets in the so-called \"Pattu\" school. With the writing of \"Krishnagatha\" by Cherusseri, the validity of the use of spoken Malayalam for literary purposes received its ultimate justification. Unlike the language of \"Ramacharitam\" and the works of the Niranam poets, the language of \"Krishnagatha\" marks the culmination of a stage of evolution. There is some dispute about the author's name and his identity. Some scholars are of opinion that he was the same as the Punam Nambudiri of the \"Champus\". It is widely believed that Cherusseri lived in the 15th century CE and was the court poet of Udayavarma of Kolathunadu.\n\nMalayalam literature passed through a tremendous process of development in the 15th and 16th centuries. Cherusseri's \"Krishnagatha\" bore witness to the evolution of modern Malayalam language as a proper medium for serious poetic communication. Alongside this, there flourished numerous Sanskrit poets who were very active during this period. The greatest of them was Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri (1559–1665), the author of \"Narayaniyam\". The most significant development of the time took place in the field of Malayalam poetry. Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan wrote his two great epics \"Adhyathmaramayanam\" and \"Srimahabharatam\" and two shorter pieces, \"Irupathinalu Vrittam\" and \"Harinama Kirtanam\" and thereby revolutionised Malayalam language and literature at once. Ezhuthachan refined the style of Malayalam language and it was during his period that Malayalam literature attained its individuality and Malayalam became a fully fledged independent language. Today he is known as the father of Malayalam language and its literature. The \"Kilippattu\" form he adopted in \"Ramayanam\" and \"Bharatam\" may be a pointer to his recognition of the importance of sound effect in poetry. Ezhuthachan is perhaps the greatest spokesman of the Bhakti movement in Malayalam but he is more than a writer of devotional hymns. K. Ayyappa Paniker has noted that \"the transition from Cherrusseri to Ezhuthachan marks the triumph of modernism over medievalism.\" Another important poet of this period was Poonthanam Nambudiri (1547–1640). His chief poems are \"Jnanappana\" (The Song of Divine Wisdom), \"Bhasha Karnamritam\" and \"Kumaraharanam\" or \"Santanagopalam Pana\".\n\nThe 16th century also saw the writing of some dramatic works in \"Manipravalam\" and pure Malayalam, \"Bharatavakyam\", often described as a choral narration, is a work in \"Manipravalam\" which was used for stage performance. The main development in the cultural field in Kerala in the 17th century was the growth of a new form of visual art called Kathakali, which brought into being a new genre of poetry called Attakkatha consisting of the libretto used for a Kathakali performance. The origins of \"aattakatha\" literature dates back to the 12th century and it emerged as a literary genre in the 17th century. The earliest of the \"aattakathas\" is believed to be a cycle of eight \"Ramayana\" stories (collectively known as \"Ramanattam\"), composed by Kottarakkara Tampuran and about whose date there is an ongoing controversy. Next in importance are the works of Kottayathu Tampuran whose period is about the middle of the seventeenth century. Since the four \"aattakatha\"s he wrote \"Bakavadham, Kalyanasaugandhikam, Kirmeeravadham\" and \"Kalakeyavadham\" punctiliously conform to the strict rules of Kathakali, they are particularly favoured by orthodox artistes and their patrons. Another poet of this category is Irayimman Thampi (1783–1863). Unnayi Variyar’s \"Nalacharitham Aattakatha\" is one of the most famous works in this genre. \"Margamkali\" was the form of ritual and entertainment among the Syrian Christians corresponding to the \"Sanghakali\" of the Brahmins. \"Margamkalippattu\" is the song for this performance depicting the story of Thomas the Apostle. This was one of the numerous pieces of Christian literature that must have gained currency in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nIn the court of Travancore king Marthanda Varma (1706–1758) and his successor Dharma Raja Kartika Tirunal Rama Varma, there flourished a number of poets distinguished in several ways. Ramapurathu Warrier (1703–1753), the author of \"Kuchela Vrittam Vanchippattu\", was one of them. The \"Vanchippattu\" or Boat song is a poetic form of folk origin composed entirely in the Dravidian metre \"nathonnata\". Kunchan Nambiar (1705–1770), the founder of Thullal and its rich literature, is often considered as the master of Malayalam satirist poetry. Born in Killikkurussimangalam, he spent his boyhood at Kudamalur and youth at Ambalappuzha. 1748 he moved to the court of Marthanda Varma and later to the court of his successor Dharma Raja. The word \"Thullal\" literally means \"dance\", but under this name Nambiar devised a new style of verse narration with a little background music and dance-like swinging movement to wean the people away from the Chakkiyar Koothu, which was the art form popular till then. He used pure Malayalam as opposed to the stylised and Sanskritised Malayalam language of Chakkiyar Koothu. He also adopted many elements from Padayani and Kolam Thullal and certain other local folk arts. There are three kinds of Tullal distinguished on the basis of the performer's costume and the style of rendering, viz., \"Ottan, Sitankan\" and \"Parayan\". Dravidian metres are used throughout although there is a quatrain in a Sanskrit metre.\n\nThere was a great lull in the field of literary creation in Malayalam for nearly a century after the death of Kunchan Nambiar. There was however a consistent and steady development of prose at this time. The evolution of prose literature in the early centuries was a very slow process. In the wake of \"Bhashakautaliyam\" several translations began to appear in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The prose of \"Attaprakarams\" was meant to aid the Chakiyars in learning the art of Koodiyattom. \"Doothavakyam\" (14th century CE) is one of the earliest of these works. 15th century Malayalam prose is represented by \"Brahmanda Puranam\", a summary of the original in Sanskrit. A large number of prose works appeared during this period, most of which are either narrative based on \"puranas\" and religious works in Sanskrit or commentaries on similar works. With the starting of the first printing presses in the 16th century by Christian missionaries, prose literature received a great boost. Several regional versions of \"Keralolpathi\", tracing the beginnings of Kerala history, began to appear in the 18th century. Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar (1737–1799) wrote the first travelogue in Malayalam, \"Varthamanapustakam\" (Book of News). The works of Christian missionaries like Arnos Patiri (Johann Ernst Hanxleden), 1699–1732) and Paulinose Patiri (John Philip Wesdin, 1748–1806) also led to a widening of the range of topics and themes in Malayalam literature.\n\nThe third quarter of the nineteenth century bore witness to the rise of a new school of poets devoted to the observation of life around them and the use of pure Malayalam. The major poets of the Venmani school were Venmani Achhan Nambudiripad (1817–1891), Venmani Mahan Nambudiripad (1844–1893), Poonthottam Achhan Nambudiri (1821–1865), Poonthottam Mahan Nambudiri (1857–1896) and the members of the Kodungallur Kovilakam (Royal Family) such as Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran. The style of these poets became quite popular for a while and influenced even others who were not members of the group like Velutheri Kesavan Vaidyar (1839–1897) and Perunlli Krishnan Vaidyan (1863–1894). The Venmani school pioneered a style of poetry that was associated with common day themes, and the use of pure Malayalam rather than Sanskrit. The poetry was therefore easily understood by the common man. The works were known for its humour, wit, and lyrical metre.\n\nNineteenth century was not a very creative period for Malayalam literature (except towards the end) from the point of view of imaginative writing. But the foundations for the great renaissance that began at the end of the century were laid during this period. The establishment of colleges for imparting English education, the translation of the Bible and other religious works, the compilation of dictionaries and grammars, the formation of the text book committee, the growth of printing presses, the starting of newspapers and periodicals, the introduction of science and technology, the beginning of industrialization and the awakening of social and political consciousness: these constitute the giant strides towards modernisation. Like his predecessors Swathi Thirunal and Uthram Thirunal, Ayilyam Thirunal (1832–1880) and Visakham Thirunal (1837–1885) were great patrons of letters and were themselves talented writers. Christian missionaries Benjamin Bailey (1805–1871), Joseph Peet, Richard Collins and George Mathen (1819–1870) were responsible for many works on Malayalam language based on western models. Perhaps the most important of these missionaries was Herman Gundert (1814–1893). Born in Stuttgart in Germany and educated at Tübingen and Switzerland, Gundert came to India in 1836. He wrote over twenty books in Malayalam, the most important of which are \"A Malayalam-English Dictionary, A Grammar of Malayalam, Keralappazhama\" and \"Pazhamcholmala\". The first authoritative grammar of Malayalam was also Gundert’s contribution (1851). This led to the production of a number of grammatical works in Malayalam. Vaikkam Patchu Moothathu (1814–1883) published his \"Grammar of Malayalam\" in 1876, \"Kerala Kaumudi\" by Kovunni Nedungadi (1831–1889) came out in 1878. This was soon followed by the first history of the language by P. Govinda Pillai (1849–1897) published in 1881. The first work on rhetoric in Malayalam on the European model was brought out by Father Gerad under the title \"Alankara Sastram\" in the same year. By the end of the 19th century two different traditions could be clearly distinguished in Malayalam literature: the western school and the oriental or traditionalist school. Writers such as Kerala Varma Valiya Koyithampuran represent the confluence of these two major traditions. His major works include \"Mayurasandesam\" (Peacock Message) and the translations of Kalidasa's \"Abhijñānaśākuntalam\" (which got him the title of Kerala Kalidasa), and of Von Limburg Brower's \"Akbar\". Meanwhile, many literary magazines were established to encourage all kinds of writers and writings, such as C. P. Achutha Menon's \"Vidyavinodini\", Kandathil Varghese Mappillai's \"Bhashaposhini\" and Appan Thampuran's \"Rasikaranjini\".\n\nIn the wake of Kerala Varma's translation of \"Abhijñānaśākuntalam\", several attempts were made to translate numerous plays from Sanskrit and English into Malayalam. These plays were seldom acted. The stage conditions of those days were crude and unfit to project a performance. As if irritated by this imitation plays of low quality, P. Rama Kurup wrote \"Chakki Chankaram\" (1893). Kerala Varma's nephew A. R. Raja Raja Varma went a step further than his uncle in the promotion of a synthesis between the different trends current in the literature of his time. A professor in the His Highness Maharaja's University College, Thiruvananthapuram, he had to modernize the process of teaching Malayalam language and literature; this made him write books on grammar and rhetoric (which earned him the title of Kerala Panini) and eventually prepare the ground for an enlightened renaissance in Malayalam poetry and literary criticism. A close associate of both Kerala Varma and Raja Raja Varma, K. C. Kesava Pillai wrote \"Kesaviyam\" (a \"mahakavya\") and a number of \"attakkathas\". Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup (1869–1932: author of \"Ramachandravilasam\"), Pandalam Kerala Varma (1879–1919: author of \"Rukmangatha Charitam\"), Kattakkayam Cherian Mappila (1859 – 1937: author of \"Sri Yesu Vijayam\"), Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer (1877–1949 : author of \"Umakeralam\") and Vallathol Narayana Menon (1879–1958: author of \"Chitrayogam\"), all paid their obeisance to this neoclassicist trend.\n\nThe developments in prose at this time were very significant, Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar (1861–1895), more famous under his pseudonym Kesari, was one of the first to explore the essay form in Malayalam. He was closely associated with periodicals like \"Kerala Chandrika\" (started in 1879 at Thiruvananthapuram), \"Kerala Patrika\" (started in 1884 by C. Kunhiraman Menon (1854–1936) and Appu Nedungadi (1866–1934) at Kozhikode), \"Kerala Sanchari\" (after 1898 under the editorship of Murkoth Kumaran) and the English Journal \"Malabar Spectator\". His \"Vasanavikriti\" is considered by historians and literary experts as the first short story in Malayalam literature. It was published in \"Vidyavinodini\" in 1891. \"Fulmoni Ennum Koruna Ennum Peraya Randu Sthreekalude Katha\" (Phulmōni ennuṁ kōruṇa ennuṁ pērāya ranṭu strīkaḷuṭe katha), a translation of Hana Catherine Mullens's Bengali novel \"Fulmoni O Korunar Biboron\" by Rev. Joseph Peet, is believed to be the first novel printed and released in Malayalam (1858). \"Ghathakawadham\" (\"Ghātakavadhaṁ\", 1877) by Rev. Richard Collins was the first novel printed and published in Malayalam with a story based in Kerala and around Malayalis.\n\nThe first novel conceived and published in Malayalam was Appu Nedungadi's \"Kundalatha\" (1887). Though \"Kundalatha\" is not considered a major novel, it gets the pride of place as the first work in the language having the basic characteristics of a novel. O. Chandhu Menon's \"Indulekha\" was the first major novel in Malayalam language. It was a landmark in the history of Malayalam literature and initiated the novel as a new flourishing genre. The title refers to the main character in this novel, a beautiful, well educated Nair lady of 18 years. C. V. Raman Pillai's \"Marthandavarma\" (1891) had many distinctions: it was the first historical novel in any South Indian languages, first novel from Travancore, first Malayalam novel to be a part of a trilogy and the first Malayalam novel to have a masculine title. \"Marthandavarma\" was completed even before \"Indulekha\" but could not be published until 1891 owing to lack of finance. The novel recounted the history of Venad (Travancore) during the final period of Rajah Rama Varma's reign and subsequently to the accession of Marthanda Varma. The novel had a film adaptation of the same name in 1933 and was the first Malayalam novel to be adapted into film. During the early 20th century, Malayalam received outstanding novels, either as translations or adaptations of Western literature. The post-independence period saw a fresh start in the history of longer fiction in Malayalam as in many other Indian languages, parallel to the evolution of post-world war fiction in other parts of the world. It was both a break and a continuation. P. Kesava Dev, who was a Communist in the thirties and forties turned away from diehard ideologies and wrote a symbolic novel called \"Arku Vendi?\" (For Whose Sake?) in 1950, challenging the philosophy of Stalinist liquidation of political enemies. It had a special significance in the context of the 'Calcutta thesis'. After portraying the class struggle of farm labourers in \"Randidangazhi\" (Two Measures) in 1949, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai turned away from party politics and produced a moving romance in \"Chemmeen\" (Shrimps) in 1956. For S. K. Pottekkatt and Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, who had not dabbled in politics, the continuity is marked in the former's \"Vishakanyaka\" (Poison Maid, 1948) and the latter's \"Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu\" (My Grandpa had an Elephant, 1951). The non-political social or domestic novel was championed by P. C. Kuttikrishnan (Uroob) with his \"Ummachu\" (1955) and \"Sundarikalum Sundaranmarum\" (Men and Women of Charm, 1958). In 1957 Basheer’s \"Pathummayude Aadu\" (Pathumma’s Goat) brought in a new kind of prose tale, which perhaps only Basheer could handle with dexterity. The fifties thus mark the evolution of a new kind of fiction, which had its impact on the short stories as well. This was the auspicious moment for the entry of M. T. Vasudevan Nair and T. Padmanabhan upon the scene. Front runners in the post-modern trend include Kakkanadan, O. V. Vijayan, M. Mukundan and Anand.\n\nList of early prose literature in the 19th century.\n\ndrbalakrishnankg writer Malayalam-Language articles and poetry\nmajor works\nente kavithakal vol.1 (2017) \nente kavithakal vol.2 (2017)\nente kavithakal vol.3 (2017)\npublished by createspace amazon \navailable worldwide\n\n\n"}

Middle Persian is classified as a Western Iranian language. It descends from Old Persian and is the linguistic ancestor of Modern Persian.\n\nTraces of Middle Persian, or Parsik, are found in remnants of Sasanian inscriptions and Egyptian papyri, coins and seals, fragments of Manichaean writings, and treatises and Zoroastrian books from the Sasanian era, as well as in the post-Sasanian Zoroastrian variant of the language sometimes known as Pahlavi, which originally referred to the Pahlavi scripts, and that was also the preferred writing system for several other Middle Iranian languages. Aside from the Aramaic alphabet-derived Pahlavi script, Zoroastrian Middle Persian was occasionally also written in Pazend, a system derived from the Avestan alphabet that, unlike Pahlavi, indicated vowels and did not employ logograms. Manichaean Middle Persian texts were written in the Manichaean alphabet, which also derives from Aramaic but in an Eastern Iranian form via the Sogdian alphabet.\n\n\"Middle Iranian\" is the name given to middle stage of development of the numerous Iranian languages and dialects. The middle stage of Iranian languages begins around 450 BCE and ends around 650 CE. One of those Middle Iranian languages is Middle Persian, i.e. the middle stage of the language of the Persians, an Iranian peoples of Persia proper, which lies in the south-western highlands on the border with Babylonia. The Persians called their language \"Parsik\", meaning \"Persian\".\n\nAnother Middle Iranian language was Parthian, i.e. the language of the northwestern Iranian peoples of Parthia proper, which lies along the southern/south-eastern edge of the Caspian sea and is adjacent to the boundary between western and eastern Iranian languages. The Parthians called their language \"Parthawik\", meaning \"Parthian\". Via regular sound changes \"Parthawik\" became \"Pahlawik\", from which the word 'Pahlavi' eventually evolved. The \"-ik\" in \"parsik\" and \"parthawik\" was a regular Middle Iranian appurtenant suffix for \"pertaining to\". The New Persian equivalent of \"-ik\" is \"-i\".\n\nWhen the Arsacids (who were Parthians) came to power in the 3rd-century BCE, they inherited the use of written Greek (from the successors of Alexander the Great) as the language of government. Under the cultural influence of the Greeks (Hellenization), some Middle Iranian languages, such as Bactrian, also had begun to be written in Greek script. But yet other Middle Iranian languages began to be written in a script derived from Aramaic. This occurred primarily because \"written\" Aramaic had previously been the written language of government of the former Achaemenids, and the government scribes had carried that practice all over the empire. This practice had led to others adopting Imperial Aramaic as the language of communications, both between Iranians and non-Iranians, as well as between Iranians. The transition from Imperial Aramaic to Middle Iranian took place very slowly, with a slow increase of more and more Iranian words so that Aramaic with Iranian elements gradually changed into Iranian with Aramaic elements. Under Arsacid hegemony, this Aramaic-derived writing system for Iranian languages came to be associated with the Parthians in particular (it may have originated in the Parthian chancellories), and thus the writing system came to be called \"pahlavi\" \"Parthian\" too.\n\nAside from Parthian, Aramaic-derived writing was adopted for at least four other Middle Iranian languages, one of which was Middle Persian. In the 3rd-century CE, the Parthian Arsacids were overthrown by the Sassanids, who were natives of the south-west and thus spoke Middle Persian as their native language. Under Sassanid hegemony, the Middle Persian language became a prestige dialect and thus also came to be used by non-Persian Iranians. In the 7th-century, the Sassanids were overthrown by the Arabs. Under Arab influence, Iranian languages began be written in Arabic script (adapted to Iranian phonology), while Middle Persian began to rapidly evolve into New Persian and the name \"parsik\" became Arabicized \"farsi\". Not all Iranians were comfortable with these Arabic-influenced developments, in particular, members of the literate elite, which in Sassanid times consisted primarily of Zoroastrian priests. Those former elites vigorously rejected what they perceived as 'Un-Iranian', and continued to use the \"old\" language (i.e. Middle Persian) and Aramaic-derived writing system. In time, the name of the writing system, \"pahlavi\" \"Parthian\", began to be applied to the \"old\" Middle Persian language as well, thus distinguishing it from the \"new\" language, \"farsi\". Consequently, 'pahlavi' came to denote the particularly Zoroastrian, exclusively written, late form of Middle Persian. Since almost all surviving Middle Persian literature is in this particular late form of exclusively written Zoroastrian Middle Persian, in popular imagination the term 'Pahlavi' became synonymous with Middle Persian itself. \n\nThe ISO 639 language code for Middle Persian is \"pal\", which reflects the post-Sasanian era use of the term Pahlavi to refer to the language and not only the script.\n\nIn the classification of the Iranian languages, the Middle Period includes those languages which were common in Iran from the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in the fourth century BCE up to the fall of the Sasanian Empire in the seventh century CE.\n\nThe most important and distinct development in the structure of Iranian languages of this period is the transformation from the synthetic form of the Old Period (Old Persian and Avestan) to an analytic form:\n\nThe modern-day descendant of Middle Persian is New Persian. The changes between late Middle and Early New Persian were very gradual, and in the 10th-11th centuries, Middle Persian texts were still intelligible to speakers of Early New Persian. However, there are definite differences that had taken place already by the 10th century:\n\n\n\"Pahlavi Middle Persian\" is the language of quite a large body of literature which details the traditions and prescriptions of Zoroastrianism, which was the state religion of Sasanian Iran (224 to c. 650) before the Muslim conquest of Persia. The earliest texts in Zoroastrian Middle Persian were probably written down in late Sasanian times (6th–7th centuries), although they represent the codification of earlier oral tradition. However, most texts, including the translated versions of the Zoroastrian canon, date from the ninth to the 11th century, when Middle Persian had long ceased to be a spoken language, so they reflect the state of affairs in living Middle Persian only indirectly. The surviving manuscripts are usually 14th-century copies. Other, less abundantly attested varieties are \"Manichaean Middle Persian\", used for a sizable amount of Manichaean religious writings, including many theological texts, homilies and hymns (3rd–9th, possibly 13th century), and the Middle Persian of the Church of the East, evidenced in the Pahlavi Psalter (7th century); these were used until the beginning of the second millennium in many places in Central Asia, including Turpan and even localities in South India. All three differ minimally from one another and indeed the less ambiguous and archaizing scripts of the latter two have helped to elucidate some aspects of the Sasanian-era pronunciation of the former.\n\nBelow is transcription and translation of the first page of the facsimile known as \"Book of Arda Viraf\", originally written in a Pahlavi script.\n\nA sample Middle Persian poem from manuscript of Jamasp Asana:\n\nThere are a number of affixes in Middle Persian that did not survive into Modern Persian:\n\nThere are a number of phonological differences between Middle Persian and New Persian. The long vowels of Middle Persian did not survive in many present-day dialects. Also, initial consonant clusters were very common in Middle Persian (e.g. spās \"thanks\"). However, New Persian does not allow initial consonant clusters, whereas final consonant clusters are common (e.g. asb \"horse\").\n\nThere is a number of Persian loanwords in English, many of which can be traced to Middle Persian. The lexicon of Classical Arabic also contains many borrowings from Middle Persian. In such borrowings Iranian consonants that sound foreign to Arabic, \"g\", \"č\", \"p\", and \"ž\", have been replaced by \"q/k\", \"j\", \"š\", \"f/b\", and \"s/z\". Here is a parallel word list of such terms:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "415847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415847", "title": "Rewriting", "text": "Rewriting\n\nIn mathematics, computer science, and logic, rewriting covers a wide range of (potentially non-deterministic) methods of replacing subterms of a formula with other terms. The objects of focus for this article include rewriting systems (also known as rewrite systems, rewrite engines or reduction systems). In their most basic form, they consist of a set of objects, plus relations on how to transform those objects.\n\nRewriting can be non-deterministic. One rule to rewrite a term could be applied in many different ways to that term, or more than one rule could be applicable. Rewriting systems then do not provide an algorithm for changing one term to another, but a set of possible rule applications. When combined with an appropriate algorithm, however, rewrite systems can be viewed as computer programs, and several theorem provers and declarative programming languages are based on term rewriting.\n\nIn logic, the procedure for obtaining the conjunctive normal form (CNF) of a formula can be implemented as a rewriting system. The rules of an example of such a system would be:\n\nwhere the symbol (formula_6) indicates that an expression matching the left hand side of the rule can be rewritten to one formed by the right hand side, and the symbols each denote a subexpression. In such a system, each rule is chosen so that the left side is equivalent to the right side, and consequently when the left side matches a subexpression, performing a rewrite of that subexpression from left to right maintains logical consistency and value of the entire expression.\n\nIn linguistics, rewrite rules, also called phrase structure rules, are used in some systems of generative grammar, as a means of generating the grammatically correct sentences of a language. Such a rule typically takes the form A → X, where A is a syntactic category label, such as noun phrase or sentence, and X is a sequence of such labels or morphemes, expressing the fact that A can be replaced by X in generating the constituent structure of a sentence. For example, the rule S → NP VP means that a sentence can consist of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase; further rules will specify what sub-constituents a noun phrase and a verb phrase can consist of, and so on.\n\nFrom the above examples, it is clear that we can think of rewriting systems in an abstract manner. We need to specify a set of objects and the rules that can be applied to transform them. The most general (unidimensional) setting of this notion is called an abstract reduction system, (abbreviated ARS), although more recently authors use abstract rewriting system as well. (The preference for the word \"reduction\" here instead of \"rewriting\" constitutes a departure from the uniform use of \"rewriting\" in the names of systems that are particularizations of ARS. Because the word \"reduction\" does not appear in the names of more specialized systems, in older texts reduction system is a synonym for ARS).\n\nAn ARS is simply a set \"A\", whose elements are usually called objects, together with a binary relation on \"A\", traditionally denoted by →, and called the reduction relation, rewrite relation or just reduction. This (entrenched) terminology using \"reduction\" is a little misleading, because the relation is not necessarily reducing some measure of the objects; this will become more apparent when we discuss string-rewriting systems further in this article.\n\nExample 1. Suppose the set of objects is \"T\" = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"} and the binary relation is given by the rules \"a\" → \"b\", \"b\" → \"a\", \"a\" → \"c\", and \"b\" → \"c\". Observe that these rules can be applied to both \"a\" and \"b\" in any fashion to get the term \"c\". Such a property is clearly an important one. Note also, that \"c\" is, in a sense, a \"simplest\" term in the system, since nothing can be applied to \"c\" to transform it any further. This example leads us to define some important notions in the general setting of an ARS. First we need some basic notions and notations.\n\n\nAn object \"x\" in \"A\" is called reducible if there exists some other \"y\" in \"A\" such that formula_20; otherwise it is called irreducible or a normal form. An object \"y\" is called a normal form of \"x\" if formula_21, and \"y\" is irreducible. If \"x\" has a \"unique\" normal form, then this is usually denoted with formula_22. In example 1 above, \"c\" is a normal form, and formula_23. If every object has at least one normal form, the ARS is called normalizing.\n\nA related, but weaker notion than the existence of normal forms is that of two objects being joinable: \"x\" and \"y\" are said to be joinable if there exists some \"z\" with the property that formula_24. From this definition, it is apparent that one may define the joinability relation as formula_25, where formula_26 is the composition of relations. Joinability is usually denoted, somewhat confusingly, also with formula_27, but in this notation the down arrow is a binary relation, i.e. we write formula_28 if \"x\" and \"y\" are joinable.\n\nOne of the important problems that may be formulated in an ARS is the word problem: given \"x\" and \"y\", are they equivalent under formula_29? This is a very general setting for formulating the word problem for the presentation of an algebraic structure. For instance, the word problem for groups is a particular case of an ARS word problem. Central to an \"easy\" solution for the word problem is the existence of unique normal forms: in this case if two objects have the same normal form, then they are equivalent under formula_15. The word problem for an ARS is undecidable in general.\n\nAn ARS is said to possess the Church–Rosser property if formula_31 implies formula_28. In words, the Church–Rosser property means that any two equivalent objects are joinable. Alonzo Church and J. Barkley Rosser proved in 1936 that lambda calculus has this property; hence the name of the property. (That lambda calculus has this property is also known as the Church–Rosser theorem.) In an ARS with the Church–Rosser property the word problem may be reduced to the search for a common successor. In a Church–Rosser system, an object has \"at most one\" normal form; that is the normal form of an object is unique if it exists, but it may well not exist.\n\nSeveral different properties are equivalent to the Church–Rosser property, but may be simpler to check in some particular setting. In particular, \"confluence\" is equivalent to Church–Rosser. An ARS formula_33 is said:\n\n\nTheorem. For an ARS the following conditions are equivalent: (i) it has the Church–Rosser property, (ii) it is confluent.\n\nCorollary. In a confluent ARS if formula_31 then\n\nBecause of these equivalences, a fair bit of variation in definitions is encountered in the literature. For instance, in Bezem \"et al.\" 2003 the Church–Rosser property and confluence are defined to be synonymous and identical to the definition of confluence presented here; Church–Rosser as defined here remains unnamed, but is given as an equivalent property; this departure from other texts is deliberate. Because of the above corollary, in a confluent ARS one may define a normal form \"y\" of \"x\" as an irreducible \"y\" with the property that formula_31. This definition, found in Book and Otto, is equivalent to common one given here in a confluent system, but it is more inclusive more in a non-confluent ARS.\n\nLocal confluence on the other hand is not equivalent with the other notions of confluence given in this section, but it is strictly weaker than confluence.\nThe relation formula_41 is locally confluent, but not confluent, as formula_42 and formula_43 are equivalent, but not joinable.\n\nAn abstract rewriting system is said to be terminating or noetherian if there is no infinite chain formula_44. In a terminating ARS, every object has at least one normal form, thus it is normalizing. The converse is not true. In example 1 for instance, there is an infinite rewriting chain, namely formula_45, even though the system is normalizing. A confluent and terminating ARS is called convergent. In a convergent ARS, every object has a unique normal form. \n\nTheorem (Newman's Lemma): A terminating ARS is confluent if and only if it is locally confluent.\n\nA string rewriting system (SRS), also known as semi-Thue system, exploits the free monoid structure of the strings (words) over an alphabet to extend a rewriting relation, formula_46 to \"all\" strings in the alphabet that contain left- and respectively right-hand sides of some rules as substrings. Formally a semi-Thue systems is a tuple formula_47 where formula_48 is a (usually finite) alphabet, and formula_46 is a binary relation between some (fixed) strings in the alphabet, called rewrite rules. The one-step rewriting relation relation formula_50 induced by formula_46 on formula_52 is defined as: for any strings formula_53 formula_54 if and only if there exist formula_55 such that formula_56, formula_57, and formula_58. Since formula_50 is a relation on formula_52, the pair formula_61 fits the definition of an abstract rewriting system. Obviously formula_46 is subset of formula_50. If the relation formula_46 is symmetric, then the system is called a Thue system.\n\nIn a SRS, the reduction relation formula_65 is compatible with the monoid operation, meaning that formula_66 implies formula_67 for all strings formula_55. Similarly, the reflexive transitive symmetric closure of formula_50, denoted formula_70, is a congruence, meaning it is an equivalence relation (by definition) and it is also compatible with string concatenation. The relation formula_70 is called the Thue congruence generated by formula_46. In a Thue system, i.e. if formula_46 is symmetric, the rewrite relation formula_65 coincides with the Thue congruence formula_70.\n\nThe notion of a semi-Thue system essentially coincides with the presentation of a monoid. Since formula_70 is a congruence, we can define the factor monoid formula_77 of the free monoid formula_52 by the Thue congruence in the usual manner. If a monoid formula_79 is isomorphic with formula_80, then the semi-Thue system formula_47 is called a monoid presentation of formula_79.\n\nWe immediately get some very useful connections with other areas of algebra. For example, the alphabet {\"a\", \"b\"} with the rules { \"ab\" → ε, \"ba\" → ε }, where ε is the empty string, is a presentation of the free group on one generator. If instead the rules are just { \"ab\" → ε }, then we obtain a presentation of the bicyclic monoid. Thus semi-Thue systems constitute a natural framework for solving the word problem for monoids and groups. In fact, every monoid has a presentation of the form formula_47, i.e. it may always be presented by a semi-Thue system, possibly over an infinite alphabet.\n\nThe word problem for a semi-Thue system is undecidable in general; this result is sometimes known as the Post-Markov theorem.\n\nA term rewriting system (TRS) is a rewriting system whose objects are \"terms\", which are expressions with nested sub-expressions. For example, the system shown under \"\" above is a term rewriting system. The terms in this system are composed of binary operators formula_84 and formula_85 and the unary operator formula_86. Also present in the rules are \"variables\",\nthese each represent any possible term (though a single variable always represents the same term throughout a single rule).\n\nIn contrast to string rewriting systems, whose objects are sequences of symbols, the objects of a term rewriting system form a term algebra. A term can be visualized as a tree of symbols, the set of admitted symbols being fixed by a given signature.\n\nA term rewriting rule is a pair of terms, commonly written as formula_87, to indicate that the left-hand side formula_88 can be replaced by the right-hand side formula_89. A term rewriting system is a set formula_46 of such rules. A rule formula_87 can be applied to a term formula_92 if the left term formula_88 matches some subterm of formula_92, that is, if formula_95\nfor some position formula_96 in formula_92 and some substitution formula_98. The result term formula_99 of this rule application is then obtained as formula_100;\nsee picture 1. In this case, formula_92 is said to be rewritten in one step, or rewritten directly, to formula_99 by the system formula_46, formally denoted as formula_104, formula_105, or as formula_106 by some authors. \nIf a term formula_107 can be rewritten in several steps into a term formula_108, that is, if formula_109, the term formula_107 is said to be rewritten to formula_108, formally denoted as formula_112.\nIn other words, the relation formula_113 is the transitive closure of the relation formula_50;\noften, also the notation formula_65 is used to denote the reflexive-transitive closure of formula_50, that is,\nformula_117 if formula_118 or \nA term rewriting given by a set formula_46 of rules can be viewed as an abstract rewriting system as defined above, with terms as its objects and formula_50 as its rewrite relation.\n\nFor example, formula_121 is a rewrite rule, commonly used to establish a normal form with respect to the associativity of formula_122.\nThat rule can be applied at the numerator in the term formula_123 with the matching substitution formula_124, see picture 2.\nApplying that substitution to the rule's right hand side yields the term formula_125, and replacing the numerator by that term yields formula_126, which is the result term of applying the rewrite rule.\nAltogether, applying the rewrite rule has achieved what is called \"applying the associativity law for formula_122 to formula_123\" in elementary algebra.\nAlternatively, the rule could have been applied to the denominator of the original term, yielding formula_129.\n\nBeyond section Termination and convergence, additional subtleties are to be considered for \"term\" rewriting systems.\n\nTermination even of a system consisting of one rule with a linear left-hand side is undecidable. \nTermination is also undecidable for systems using only unary function symbols; however, it is decidable for finite ground systems.\nThe following term rewrite system is normalizing, but not terminating, and not confluent:\n\nThe following two examples of terminating term rewrite systems are due to Toyama: \nand \nTheir union is a non-terminating system, since formula_136. This result disproves a conjecture of Dershowitz, who claimed that the union of two terminating term rewrite systems formula_137 and formula_138 is again terminating if all left-hand sides of formula_137 and right-hand sides of formula_138 are linear, and there are no \"overlaps\" between left-hand sides of formula_137 and right-hand sides of formula_138. All these properties are satisfied by Toyama's examples.\n\nSee Rewrite order and Path ordering (term rewriting) for ordering relations used in termination proofs for term rewriting systems.\n\nA generalization of term rewrite systems are graph rewrite systems, operating on graphs instead of (ground-) terms / their corresponding tree representation.\n\nTrace theory provides a means for discussing multiprocessing in more formal terms, such as via the trace monoid and the history monoid. Rewriting can be performed in trace systems as well.\n\nRewriting systems can be seen as programs that infer end-effects from a list of cause-effect relationships. In this way, rewriting systems can be considered to be automated causality provers.\n\n\n\n"}

It has a grammar unlike the (spoken or written) Russian language, with much stricter word order and word formation rules. Russian Sign Language belongs to the French Sign Language family. Vocabulary from Austrian Sign Language also heavily influences Russian Sign Language.\n\nRussian Sign Language (РЖЯ) has its own grammar and is used by Deaf Russians in everyday communication. However, there is a \"signed Russian\" which is mainly used in official communications, such as sign language lectures at universities, conference papers, and in the past it was used on television in interpreted news programs.\n\n RSL is thought to have started ca. 1806, when a school for the deaf was opened at Pavlovsk near St. Petersburg. It was exported to Bulgaria in 1920, where it has become a separate language (Bulgarian Sign Language) rather than a dialect of Russian Sign Language, though Russian Sign Language is also used there.\n\nThe Moscow Bilingual School for the Deaf, which uses Russian Sign Language in classrooms, was opened in 1992.\n\nMuch of the early research on Russian Sign Language was done by Galina Lazarevna Zaitseva, who wrote her 1969 PhD thesis on spatial relationships in Russian Sign Language, and in 1992 devised the now standard term for Russian Sign Language \"Russkii Zhestovyi Yazyk\" (Russian: Русский Жестовый Язык). Ongoing research into the language takes place at the Centre for Deaf Studies in Moscow.\n\nRegional variation of Russian Sign appears to be relatively wide, comparable to the regional variants within Polish Sign Language or Estonian Sign Language, but greater than a more homogeneous ASL. One study reported lexical similarity between two Russian signers of 70–80%, in the same range as between those two signers and signers from Ukraine and Moldova, but due to the limited sample stopped short of drawing any conclusions as to whether they constituted the same or different languages.\n\nActive status of Russian sign language is as follows: \n\nThere are several problems concerning the study and application of sign language in Russia, which Valery Nikitich Rukhledev, President of the All-Russian Society of the Deaf cited: \n\nHowever, there is hope that the situation can change. On April 4, 2009 at the Russian Council on The Disabled, President Dmitry Medvedev discussed the issue of the status of sign language in Russia. In his closing remarks, the President of the Russian Federation expressed his opinion: \"There is indeed, a distinct lack of sign language translators. This level of need necessitates changes. There are considerations and proposals for implementation to resolve the need of training sign language interpreters to provide translation services. But I agree with what has been said: it is necessary to reconsider the preparation of the interpreters at the Ministry of Education Institutions and universities. These teachers should be prepared in virtually every federal district, because we have a huge country and it is impossible to imagine having all sign language interpreters trained in Moscow, for example, and this is the only way we can solve this problem. I am glad that the State Duma supported the initiatives of the President, so we will continue to work in the same unity, in which we have previously worked to resolve this issue.\" \n\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for his historical romance and adventure novels, often set in the times of the Chola and Pandya empires.\n\nSandilyan was born in Thirukovilur, Tamil Nadu on 10 November 1910 to Ramanujam Iyengar and Poongovilvalli. His family was from Thiruindalur village near Mayiladuthurai. He did his schooling in Chennai Pachaiyappa's School and Saidapet Model School. His college education came from Tiruchirappalli St. Joseph's College. While in college, he was influenced by the visit of C. Rajagopalachari and joined the Indian independence movement. He became a member of the Indian National Congress. He married Ranganayaki in 1929.\n\nAfter finishing college he moved to T. Nagar in the 1930s. He became friends with his neighbours V.Swaminatha Sharma who was working in Thiru. Vi. Ka's weekly magazine \"Navasakthi\" and the noted Tamil writer Kalki Krishnamurthy. With their encouragement he wrote his first short story titled \"Shantha Seelan\". Impressed with his work, Kalki published his short stories like \"Kannammavin Kadhal\", \"Adhirshtam\" in Ananda Vikatan. Encouraged by this success Sandilyan started learning the Tamil language formally from a Tamil Pandit named Thirukannapuram Srinivachariar. He started writing Tamil short stories in the Tamil Weekly \"Sudesamithran\" and also worked as a reporter in \"Sudesamithran\" from 1935 to 1942. Later he became a sub-editor at the English daily newspaper Hindustan Times.\n\nDuring his time at the Hindustan Times he became friends with B N Reddy of Vijaya Studios and Chittor V. Nagaiah. This bought him into the world of films. He co-wrote the screenplays of films like Swarga Seema (1945) and En Veedu (1953). He later wrote about his film world experiences in his book \"Cinema Valarndha Kadhai\" (1985). Later he also produced a documentary titled \"Birth of a Newspaper\".\n\nAfter his stint at the Hindustan Times he returned to work at \"Sudesamithran\" and started writing full-length novels. One of his first works was a self-published political novel called \"Balathkaaram\". He also started publishing in other magazines like \"Amudhasurabi\". \"Paalaivanathu pushpam\" and \"Sandha deepam\" were his earliest historical novels. Sandilyan's most famous novels were serialised in \"Kumudam\", a weekly Tamil magazine and was instrumental in increasing the circulation to a greater extent. He was one of the very few Tamil writers to get a monthly salary from \"Kumudam\" for his novels. After leaving \"Kumudam\", he unsuccessfully ran a weekly magazine called \"Kamalam\". His historical novels were published in book form by Vanadhi Padhippagam and became best sellers. As of 2009, many of them still remain in print, four decades after being first published. Kamil Zvelebil once called him as the \"fourth most popular Tamil Writer\".\n\nIn 2009, The Tamil Nadu Government announced its intention to nationalise Sandilyan's works (along with those of 28 other authors) and provide compensation to his legal heirs. This caused criticism from the legal heirs of Sundara Ramasami and Kannadasan. The Government soon retracted its position saying that the offer was optional and that it would force those who did not want to lose royalty. Sandilyan's legal heirs declined the Government's offer to nationalise and provide solatium.\n\n\n\n\n\n (45)\n\n"}
{"id": "2452154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2452154", "title": "Semi-Thue system", "text": "Semi-Thue system\n\nIn theoretical computer science and mathematical logic a string rewriting system (SRS), historically called a semi-Thue system, is a rewriting system over strings from a (usually finite) alphabet. Given a binary relation formula_1 between fixed strings over the alphabet, called rewrite rules, denoted by formula_2, an SRS extends the rewriting relation to all strings in which the left- and right-hand side of the rules appear as substrings, that is formula_3, where formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 are strings.\n\nThe notion of a semi-Thue system essentially coincides with the presentation of a monoid. Thus they constitute a natural framework for solving the word problem for monoids and groups.\n\nAn SRS can be defined directly as an abstract rewriting system. It can also be seen as a restricted kind of a term rewriting system. As a formalism, string rewriting systems are Turing complete. The semi-Thue name comes from the Norwegian mathematician Axel Thue, who introduced systematic treatment of string rewriting systems in a 1914 paper. Thue introduced this notion hoping to solve the word problem for finitely presented semigroups. It wasn't until 1947 the problem was shown to be undecidable— this result was obtained independently by Emil Post and A. A. Markov Jr.\n\nA string rewriting system or semi-Thue system is a tuple formula_8 where \n\nIf the relation is symmetric, then the system is called a Thue system.\n\nThe rewriting rules in can be naturally extended to other strings in formula_9 by allowing substrings to be rewritten according to . More formally, the one-step rewriting relation relation formula_14 induced by on formula_9 for any strings formula_16:\n\nSince formula_14 is a relation on formula_9, the pair formula_24 fits the definition of an abstract rewriting system. Obviously is a subset of formula_14. Some authors use a different notation for the arrow in formula_14 (e.g. formula_14) in order to distinguish it from itself (formula_28) because they later want to be able to drop the subscript and still avoid confusion between and the one-step rewrite induced by .\n\nClearly in a semi-Thue system we can form a (finite or infinite) sequence of strings produced by starting with an initial string formula_29 and repeatedly rewriting it by making one substring-replacement at a time: \n\nA zero-or-more-steps rewriting like this is captured by the reflexive transitive closure of formula_14, denoted by formula_32 (see abstract rewriting system#Basic notions). This is called the rewriting relation or reduction relation on formula_9 induced by .\n\nIn general, the set formula_9 of strings on an alphabet forms a free monoid together with the binary operation of string concatenation (denoted as formula_35 and written multiplicatively by dropping the symbol). In a SRS, the reduction relation formula_32 is compatible with the monoid operation, meaning that formula_37 implies formula_38 for all strings formula_18. Since formula_32 is by definition a preorder, formula_41 forms a monoidal preorder.\n\nSimilarly, the reflexive transitive symmetric closure of formula_14, denoted formula_43 (see abstract rewriting system#Basic notions), is a congruence, meaning it is an equivalence relation (by definition) and it is also compatible with string concatenation. The relation formula_43 is called the Thue congruence generated by . In a Thue system, i.e. if is symmetric, the rewrite relation formula_32 coincides with the Thue congruence formula_43.\n\nSince formula_43 is a congruence, we can define the factor monoid formula_48 of the free monoid formula_9 by the Thue congruence in the usual manner. If a monoid formula_50 is isomorphic with formula_51, then the semi-Thue system formula_8 is called a monoid presentation of formula_50.\n\nWe immediately get some very useful connections with other areas of algebra. For example, the alphabet {\"a\", \"b\"} with the rules { \"ab\" → ε, \"ba\" → ε }, where ε is the empty string, is a presentation of the free group on one generator. If instead the rules are just { \"ab\" → ε }, then we obtain a presentation of the bicyclic monoid.\n\nThe importance of semi-Thue systems as presentation of monoids is made stronger by the following:\n\nTheorem: Every monoid has a presentation of the form formula_8, thus it may be always be presented by a semi-Thue system, possibly over an infinite alphabet.\n\nIn this context, the set formula_55 is called the set of generators of formula_50, and formula_1 is called the set of defining relations formula_50. We can immediately classify monoids based on their presentation. formula_50 is called\n\nThe word problem for semi-Thue systems can be stated as follows: Given a semi-Thue system formula_63 and two words (strings) formula_64, can formula_6 be transformed into formula_7 by applying rules from formula_1? This problem is undecidable, i.e. there is no general algorithm for solving this problem. This even holds if we limit the input to finite systems.\n\nMartin Davis offers the lay reader a two-page proof in his article \"What is a Computation?\" pp. 258–259 with commentary p. 257. Davis casts the proof in this manner: \"Invent [a word problem] whose solution would lead to a solution to the halting problem.\"\n\nA semi-Thue system is also a term-rewriting system—one that has monadic words (functions) ending in the same variable as the left- and right-hand side terms, e.g. a term rule formula_68 is equivalent to the string rule formula_69.\n\nA semi-Thue system is also a special type of Post canonical system, but every Post canonical system can also be reduced to an SRS. Both formalisms are Turing complete, and thus equivalent to Noam Chomsky's unrestricted grammars, which are sometimes called \"semi-Thue grammars\". A formal grammar only differs from a semi-Thue system by the separation of the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals, and the fixation of a starting symbol amongst non-terminals. A minority of authors actually define a semi-Thue system as a triple formula_70, where formula_71 is called the \"set of axioms\". Under this \"generative\" definition of semi-Thue system, an unrestricted grammar is just a semi-Thue system with a single axiom in which one partitions the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals, and makes the axiom a nonterminal. The simple artifice of partitioning the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals is a powerful one; it allows the definition of the Chomsky hierarchy based on what combination of terminals and non-terminals the rules contain. This was a crucial development in the theory of formal languages.\n\nSemi-Thue systems were developed as part of a program to add additional constructs to logic, so as to create systems such as propositional logic, that would allow general mathematical theorems to be expressed in a formal language, and then proven and verified in an automatic, mechanical fashion. The hope was that the act of theorem proving could then be reduced to a set of defined manipulations on a set of strings. It was subsequently realized that semi-Thue systems are isomorphic to unrestricted grammars, which in turn are known to be isomorphic to Turing machines. This method of research succeeded and now computers can be used to verify the proofs of mathematic and logical theorems.\n\nAt the suggestion of Alonzo Church, Emil Post in a paper published in 1947, first proved \"a certain Problem of Thue\" to be unsolvable, what Martin Davis states as \"...the first unsolvability proof for a problem from classical mathematics -- in this case the word problem for semigroups.\" (Undecidable p. 292)\n\nDavis [ibid] asserts that the proof was offered independently by A. A. Markov (C. R. (Doklady) Acad. Sci. U.S.S.R. (n.s.) 55(1947), pp. 583–586.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The landlord was obligated to provide protection, in exchange for the serfs' labor and goods. The Serfdom Patent, issued by the enlightened absolutist Emperor Joseph II, diminished the long-established mastery of the landlords; thus allowing the serfs to independently choose marriage partners, pursue career choices, and move between estates.\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II ruled as co-regent of the Habsburg Monarchy with his mother, Maria Theresa, from 1765 to 1780. The queen's July Decree of 1770 granted the peasants the right to justice through royal officials rather than their lords' courts. The Patent of 1772 even granted them the right to appeal to the sovereign, and limited the \"robot\" (labour that lords could demand of their serfs) to three days a week and twelve hours a day. The October Decree of 1773 capped the price of letters of release, which serfs could buy from their lords to gain their freedom.\n\nFollowing her death in 1780, Joseph II pursued further liberal reforms. His policies included the 1781 Edict of Toleration, in which the Roman Catholic Emperor granted Protestant denominations more equality than in the past. This represented a tremendous change from the Catholic-centered policies of his mother. Joseph was an enlightened absolutist ruler, incorporating reason and Enlightenment ideals into his administration. Emperor Joseph’s enlightened despot contemporaries, Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia, both claimed to detest feudalism yet chose to appease their noble classes by strengthening the serfdom system during their years in power. Author T. K. E. Blemming describes the rulers' compromises, arguing that \"in exchange for absolute power at a national level it was necessary to hand over to them [nobles] absolute power on their estates.\" Joseph refused to give in to the nobles’ demands, which would soon create difficulties in the implementation of his decrees.\n\nMuch of the Habsburg economy was based on agriculture in the 18th century. The nobles and clerics were traditionally exempt from taxes, and the burden fell mainly on the peasants. After paying dues to the landlord, the serfs were unable to create high tax revenues for Joseph's centralized state. The Emperor recognized that the abolishment of the feudal system would allow peasants to pay higher tax rates to the state. Joseph’s primary objection to feudalism was economic, but his moral objections also arose from witnessing the “inhumanity of serfdom”. He abolished beatings and hoped to allow serfs to appeal court rulings to the throne following a reorganization of the landlord judicial system.\n\nThe Patent was enforced differently amongst all of the various Habsburg lands. The nobility in Bohemia refused to enact its provisions, while the Transylvanian nobles simply refused to notify the peasants in their region about this emancipation document. The Hungarian estates claimed that their peasants were not serfs, but “tenants in fee simple, who were fully informed as to their rights and duties by precise contracts” and continued to restrict these “tenants”. In contrast, the peasants of the German-speaking provinces were actually aided by the Patent. The 1781 Serfdom Patent allowed the serfs legal rights in the Habsburg monarchy, but the document did not affect the financial dues and the physical corvée (unpaid labor) that the serfs legally owed to their landlords. Joseph II recognized the importance of these further reforms, continually attempting to destroy the economic subjugation through related laws, such as his Tax Decree of 1789. This new law would have finally realized Emperor Joseph II’s ambition to modernize Habsburg society, allowing for the end of corvée and the beginning of lesser tax obligations. Joseph’s latter reforms were withdrawn upon his death, but the personal freedom of serfs remained guaranteed through the first half of the nineteenth century due to the consequences of the 1781 Serfdom Patent.\n"}

Because of this, a stipulative definition cannot be \"correct\" or \"incorrect\"; it can only differ from other definitions, but it can be useful for its intended purpose.\n\nFor example, in the riddle of induction by Nelson Goodman, \"grue\" was \"stipulated\" to be \"a property of an object that makes it appear green if observed before some future time \"t\", and blue if observed afterward\". \"Grue\" has no meaning in standard English; therefore, Goodman created the new term and gave it a \"stipulative definition\".\n\nStipulative definitions of existing terms are useful in making theoretical arguments, or stating specific cases.

The other side of such an argument is likely to use a different stipulative definition for the same term: \"the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought\" or \"the premeditated killing of a human being\".

The set of all decimal numbers of arbitrary length is an example for an infinite language.\n\nThe alphabet of a string is the set of all of the characters that occur in a particular string. If \"s\" is a string, its alphabet is denoted by\n\nThe alphabet of a language formula_9 is the set of all characters that occur in any string of formula_9, formally:\nformula_26.\n\nFor example, the set formula_27 is the alphabet of the string formula_28,\nand the above formula_29 is the alphabet of the above language formula_22 as well as of the language of all decimal numbers.\n\nLet \"L\" be a language, and let Σ be its alphabet. A string substitution or simply a substitution is a mapping \"f\" that maps characters in Σ to languages (possibly in a different alphabet). Thus, for example, given a character \"a\" ∈ Σ, one has \"f\"(\"a\")=\"L\" where \"L\" ⊆ Δ is some language whose alphabet is Δ. This mapping may be extended to strings as\n\nfor the empty string ε, and\n\nfor string \"s\" ∈ \"L\" and character \"a\" ∈ Σ. String substitutions may be extended to entire languages as \n\nRegular languages are closed under string substitution. That is, if each character in the alphabet of a regular language is substituted by another regular language, the result is still a regular language.\nSimilarly, context-free languages are closed under string substitution.\n\nA simple example is the conversion \"f\"(.) to uppercase, which may be defined e.g. as follows:\n\nFor the extension of \"f\" to strings, we have e.g.\nFor the extension of \"f\" to languages, we have e.g.\n\nA string homomorphism (often referred to simply as a homomorphism in formal language theory) is a string substitution such that each character is replaced by a single string. That is, formula_32, where formula_2 is a string, for each character formula_34.\n\nString homomorphisms are monoid morphisms on the free monoid, preserving the empty string and the binary operation of string concatenation. Given a language formula_35, the set formula_36 is called the homomorphic image of formula_35. The inverse homomorphic image of a string formula_2 is defined as\n\nformula_39\n\nwhile the inverse homomorphic image of a language formula_35 is defined as\n\nformula_41\n\nIn general, formula_42, while one does have\n\nformula_43\n\nand\n\nformula_44\n\nfor any language formula_35.\n\nThe class of regular languages is closed under homomorphisms and inverse homomorphisms. \nSimilarly, the context-free languages are closed under homomorphisms and inverse homomorphisms.\n\nA string homomorphism is said to be ε-free (or e-free) if formula_46 for all \"a\" in the alphabet formula_47. Simple single-letter substitution ciphers are examples of (ε-free) string homomorphisms.\n\nAn example string homomorphism \"g\" can also be obtained by defining similar to the above substitution: \"g\"(‹a›) = ‹A›, ..., \"g\"(‹0›) = ε, but letting \"g\" be undefined on punctuation chars. \n\nExamples for inverse homomorphic images are\nFor the latter language, \"g\"(\"g\"({ ‹A›, ‹bb› })) = \"g\"({ ‹a› }) = { ‹A› } ≠ { ‹A›, ‹bb› }.\nThe homomorphism \"g\" is not ε-free, since it maps e.g. ‹0› to ε.\n\nA very simple string homomorphism example that maps each character to just a character is the conversion of an EBCDIC-encoded string to ASCII.\n\nIf \"s\" is a string, and formula_47 is an alphabet, the string projection of \"s\" is the string that results by removing all characters that are not in formula_47. It is written as formula_50. It is formally defined by removal of characters from the right hand side:\n\nHere formula_1 denotes the empty string. The projection of a string is essentially the same as a projection in relational algebra.\n\nString projection may be promoted to the projection of a language. Given a formal language \"L\", its projection is given by\n\nThe right quotient of a character \"a\" from a string \"s\" is the truncation of the character \"a\" in the string \"s\", from the right hand side. It is denoted as formula_54. If the string does not have \"a\" on the right hand side, the result is the empty string. Thus:\n\nThe quotient of the empty string may be taken:\n\nSimilarly, given a subset formula_57 of a monoid formula_58, one may define the quotient subset as\n\nLeft quotients may be defined similarly, with operations taking place on the left of a string.\n\nHopcroft and Ullman (1979) define the quotient \"L\"/\"L\" of the languages \"L\" and \"L\" over the same alphabet as \"L\"/\"L\" = { \"s\" | ∃\"t\"∈\"L\". \"st\"∈\"L\" }.\nThis is not a generalization of the above definition, since, for a string \"s\" and distinct characters \"a\", \"b\", Hopcroft's and Ullman's definition implies {\"sa\"} / {\"b\"} yielding {}, rather than { ε }.\n\nThe left quotient (when defined similar to Hopcroft and Ullman 1979) of a singleton language \"L\" and an arbitrary language \"L\" is known as Brzozowski derivative; if \"L\" is represented by a regular expression, so can be the left quotient.\n\nThe right quotient of a subset formula_57 of a monoid formula_58 defines an equivalence relation, called the right syntactic relation of \"S\". It is given by\n\nThe relation is clearly of finite index (has a finite number of equivalence classes) if and only if the family right quotients is finite; that is, if\n\nis finite. In the case that \"M\" is the monoid of words over some alphabet, \"S\" is then a regular language, that is, a language that can be recognized by a finite state automaton. This is discussed in greater detail in the article on syntactic monoids.\n\nThe right cancellation of a character \"a\" from a string \"s\" is the removal of the first occurrence of the character \"a\" in the string \"s\", starting from the right hand side. It is denoted as formula_64 and is recursively defined as\n\nThe empty string is always cancellable:\n\nClearly, right cancellation and projection commute:\n\nThe prefixes of a string is the set of all prefixes to a string, with respect to a given language:\n\nwhere formula_69.\n\nThe prefix closure of a language is\n\nExample: \nformula_71\n\nA language is called prefix closed if formula_72.\n\nThe prefix closure operator is idempotent:\n\nThe prefix relation is a binary relation formula_74 such that formula_75 if and only if formula_76.

This makes \"subject\" a fundamental term in this field. Library and information specialists assign subject labels to documents to make them findable. There are many ways to do this and in general there is not always consensus about which subject should be assigned to a given document. To optimize subject indexing and searching, we need to have a deeper understanding of what a subject is. The question: \"what is to be understood by the statement 'document A belongs to subject category X'?\" has been debated in the field for more than 100 years (see below).\n\nHjørland defined subjects as the \"epistemological potentials of documents\". This definition is in line with the request oriented understanding of indexing quoted below. The idea is that a document is assigned a subject to ease retrieval and findability. And the criteria for what should be found – what constitutes knowledge – is in the end an epistemological question.\n\nFor Cutter the stability of subjects depends on a social process in which their meaning is stabilized in a name or a designation. A subject \"referred [...] to those intellections [...] that had received a name that itself represented a distinct consensus in usage\" (Miksa, 1983a, p. 60) and: the \"systematic structure of established subjects\" is \"resident in the public realm\" (Miksa, 1983a, p. 69); \"[s]ubjects are by their very nature locations in a classificatory structure of publicly accumulated knowledge (Miksa, 1983a, p. 61). Bernd Frohmann adds: \n\n\"The stability of the public realm in turn relies upon natural and objective mental structures which, with proper education, govern a natural progression from particular to general concepts. \nSince for Cutter, mind, society, and SKO [Systems of Knowledge Organization] stand one behind the other, each supporting each, all manifesting the same structure, his discursive construction of subjects invites connections with discourses of mind, education, and society. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), by contrast, severs those connections. Melvil Dewey emphasized more than once that his system maps no structure beyond its own; there is neither a \"transcendental deduction\" of its categories nor any reference to Cutter's objective structure of social consensus. It is content-free: Dewey disdained any philosophical excogitation of the meaning of his class symbols, leaving the job of finding verbal equivalents to others. His innovation and the essence of the system lay in the notation. The DDC is a poorly semiotic system of expanding nests of ten digits, lacking any referent beyond itself. In it, a subject is wholly constituted in terms of its position in the system. The essential characteristic of a subject is a class symbol which refers only to other symbols. Its verbal equivalent is accidental, a merely pragmatic characteristic...\nThe conflict of interpretations over \"subjects\" became explicit in the battles between \"bibliography\" (an approach to subjects having much in common with Cutter's) and Dewey's \"close classification\". William Fletcher spoke for the scholarly bibliographer... Fletcher's \"subjects\", like Cutter's, referred to the categories of a fantasized, stable social order, whereas Dewey's subjects were elements of a semiological system of standardized, techno-bureaucratic administrative software for the library in its corporate, rather than high culture, incarnation\". (Frohmann, 1994, 112–113). \n\nCutter's early view on what a subject is, is probably wiser than most understandings that dominated the 20th century – and also the understanding reflected in the ISO-standard quoted below. The early statements quoted by Frohmann indicate that subjects are somehow shaped in social processes. When that is said, it should be added that they are not particularly detailed or clear. We only get a vague idea of the social nature of subjects.\n\nA system, which has en explicit theoretical foundation is Ranganathan's Colon Classification. Ranganathan provided an explicit definition of the concept of \"subject\":\nA related definition is given by one of Ranganathan's students: \n\nRanganathan's definition of \"subject\" is strongly influenced by his Colon Classification system. The colon system is based on the combination of single elements from facets to subject designation. This is the reason why the combined nature of subjects are emphasized so strongly. It leads, however, to absurdities such as the claim that gold cannot be a subject (but is alternatively termed \"an isolate\"). This aspect of the theory has been criticized by Metcalfe (1973, p. 318). Metcalfe's skepticism regarding Ranganathan's theory is formulated in hard words (op. cit., p. 317): \"This pseudo-science imposed itself on British disciples from about 1950 on...\". \n\nIt seems unacceptable that Ranganathan defines the word subject in a way that favors his own system. A scientific concept like \"subject\" should make it possible to compare different ways of establishing access to information. Whether or not subjects are combined or not should be examined once their definition has been given, it should not determined a priori, in the definition.\n\nBesides the emphasis on the combined, organizing and systematizing nature of subjects contains Ranganathan's definition of subject the pragmatic demand, that a subject should be determined in a way that suits a normal person's competency or specialization. Again we see a strange kind of wishful thinking mixing a general understanding of a concept with demands put by his own specific system. One thing is what the word subject means, quite another issue is how to provide subject descriptions that fulfill demands such as the specificity of a given information retrieval language which fulfill demands put on the system, such as precision and recall. If researchers too often define terms in ways that favor specific kinds of systems, that are such definitions not useful to provide more general theories about subjects, subject analysis and IR. Among other things are comparative studies of different kinds of systems made difficult. \n\nBased on these arguments (as well as additional arguments which have been used in the literature) we may conclude that Ranganathan's definition of the concept \"subject\" is not suited for scientific use. Like the definition of \"subject\" given by the ISO-standard for topic maps may Ranganathan's definition be useful within his own closed system. The purpose of a scientific and scholarly field is, however, to examine the relative fruitfulness of systems such as topic maps and Colon classification. For such purpose is another understanding of \"subject\" necessary.\n\nIn his book Wilson (1968) examined – in particular by thought experiments – the suitability of different methods of examining the subject of a document. The methods were:\n\n\nPatrick Wilson shows convincingly that each of these methods are insufficient to determine the subject of a document and is led to conclude ( p. 89): \"The notion of the subject of a writing is indeterminate...\" or, on p. 92 (about what users may expect to find using a particular position in a library classification system): \"For nothing definite can be expected of the things found at any given position\". In connection to the last quote has Wilson an interesting footnote in which he writes that authors of documents often use terms in ambiguous ways (\"hostility\" is used as an example). Even if the librarian could personally develop a very precise understanding of a concept, he would be unable to use it in his classification, because none of the documents use the term in the same precise way. Based on this argumentation is Wilson led to conclude: \"If people write on what are for them ill-defined phenomena, a correct description of their subjects must reflect the ill-definedness\". \n\nWilson's concept of subject was discussed by Hjørland (1992) who found that it is problematic to give up the precise understanding of such a basic term in LIS. Wilson's arguments led him to an agnostic position which Hjørland found unacceptable and unnecessary. Concerning the authors' use of ambiguous terms, the role of the subject analysis is to determine which documents would be fruitful for users to identify whether or not the documents use one or another term or whether a given term in a document is used in one or another meaning. Clear and relevant concepts and distinctions in classification systems and controlled vocabularies may be fruitful even if they are applied to documents with ambiguous terminology.\n\nRequest oriented indexing is indexing in which the anticipated request from users is influencing how documents are being indexed. The indexer ask himself: \"Under which descriptors should this entity be found?\" and \"think of all the possible queries and decide for which ones the entity at hand is relevant\" (Soergel, 1985, p. 230).\n\nRequest oriented indexing may be indexing that is targeted towards a particular audience or user group. For example, a library or a database for feminist studies may index documents different compared to a historical library. It is probably better, however, to understand request oriented indexing as policy based indexing: The indexing is done according to some ideals and reflects the purpose of the library or database doing the indexing. In this way it is not necessarily a kind of indexing based on user studies. Only if empirical data about use or users are applied should request oriented indexing be regarded as a user-based approach.\n\nThe problem of whether the subject is in the content of a document (objectively) or in the mind of the individual users (subjectively) or in a community (intersubjectively, as a social construction) is a part of the philosophical subject–object problem.\n\nRowley & Hartley (2008, p. 109) wrote \"In order to achieve good consistent indexing, the indexer must have a through appreciation of the structure of the subject and the nature of the contribution that the document is making to the advancement of knowledge within a particular discipline\". This is accordance with Hjørland's definition given above.\n\nIn the ISO-standard for topic maps the concept of subject is defined this way: \n\n\"Subject\nAnything whatsoever, regardless of whether it exists or has any other specific characteristics, about which anything whatsoever may be asserted by any means whatsoever.\" ISO 13250-1, here cited from draft: http://www1.y12.doe.gov/capabilities/sgml/sc34/document/0446.htm#overview)\n\nThis definition may work well with the closed system of concepts provided by the topic maps standard. In broader contexts, however, is not fruitful because it does not contain any specification of what to identify in a document or in a discourse when ascribing subject identification terms or symbols to it. If different methods of subject analysis imply different results, which of these results can then be said to reflect the (true) subject? (Given that the expression \"a true subject assignment\" is meaningful at all, which is an important part of the problem). Different persons may have different opinions about what the subject of a specific document is. How can a theoretical understanding of the term \"subject\" be helpful deciding principles of subject analysis?\n\nA proposal for the differentiation between concept indexing and subject indexing was given by Bernier (1980). In his opinion subject indexes are different from, and can be contrasted with, indexes to concepts, topics and words. Subjects are what authors are working and reporting on. A document can have the subject of Chromatography if this is what the author wishes to inform about. Papers using Chromatography as a\nresearch method or discussing it in a subsection do not have Chromatography as subjects. Indexers can easily drift into indexing concepts and words rather than subjects, but this is not good indexing. Bernier does not, however, differentiate author's subjects from those of the information seeker. A user may want a document about a subject, which is different from the one intended by its author. From the point of view of information systems, the subject of a document is related to the questions that the document can answer for the users (cf. the distinction between a content oriented and a request-oriented approach). \n\nHjørland & Nicolaisen (2005) investigated the concept of subject in relation to Bradford's law of scattering and made a distinction between three kinds of scattering:\n\n\"The FRSAR Working Group is aware that some controlled vocabularies provide terminology to express other aspects of works in addition to subject (such as form, genre, and target audience of resources). While very important and the focus of many user queries, these aspects describe isness or what class the work belongs to based on form or genre (e.g., novel, play, poem, essay, biography, symphony, concerto, sonata, map, drawing, painting, photograph, etc.) rather than what the work is about.\" (IFLA, 2010, p. 10).\n\n\"Those LIS authors who have focused on the subjects of visual resources, such as artworks and photographs, have often been concerned with how to distinguish between the \"aboutness\" and the \"ofness\" (both specific and generic depiction or representation) of such works (Shatford, 1986). In this sense, \"aboutness\" has a narrower meaning than that used above. A painting of a sunset over San Francisco, for instance, might be analyzed as being (generically) \"of\" sunsets and (specifically) \"of\" San Francisco, but also \"about\" the passage of time.\" (IFLA, 2010, p. 11).\nSee also: Baca & Harpring (2000) and Shatford (1986).\n\n\nDrake, C.

{"id": "18962147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18962147", "title": "Water footprint", "text": "Water footprint\n\nThe water footprint shows the extent of water use in relation to consumption by people. The water footprint of an individual, community or business is defined as the total volume of fresh water used to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business. Water use is measured in water volume consumed (evaporated) and/or polluted per unit of time. A water footprint can be calculated for any well-defined group of consumers (e.g., an individual, family, village, city, province, state or nation) or producers (e.g., a public organization, private enterprise or economic sector), for a single process (such as growing rice) or for any product or service.\n\nTraditionally, water use has been approached from the production side, by quantifying the following three columns of water use: water withdrawals in the domestic, agricultural and industrial sector. While this does provide valuable data, it is a limited way of looking at water use in a globalised world, in which products are not always consumed in their country of origin. International trade of agricultural and industrial products in effect creates a global flow of virtual water, or \"embodied water\" (akin to the concept of embodied energy). \n\nIn 2002, the water footprint concept was introduced in order to have a consumption-based indicator of water use, that could provide useful information in addition to the traditional production-sector-based indicators of water use. It is analogous to the ecological footprint concept introduced in the 1990s. The water footprint is a geographically explicit indicator, not only showing volumes of water use and pollution, but also the locations. Thus, it gives a grasp on how economic choices and processes influence the availability of adequate water resources and other ecological realities across the globe (and vice versa).\n\nGlobally, about 4 percent of precipitation falling on land each year (about ), is used by rain-fed agriculture and about half is subject to evaporation and transpiration in forests and other natural or quasi-natural landscapes. The remainder, which goes to groundwater replenishment and surface runoff, is sometimes called “total actual renewable freshwater resources”. Its magnitude was in 2012 estimated at /year. It represents water that can be used either in-stream or after withdrawal from surface and groundwater sources. Of this remainder, about were withdrawn in 2007, of which , or 69 percent, were used by agriculture, and , or 19 percent, by other industry. Most agricultural use of withdrawn water is for irrigation, which uses about 5.1 percent of total actual renewable freshwater resources. World water use has been growing rapidly in the last hundred years (see graph from \"New Scientist\" article).\n\nThe \"blue water footprint\" is the volume of water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources (lakes, rivers, wetlands and aquifers) and has either evaporated (for example while irrigating crops), incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another, or returned at a different time. Irrigated agriculture, industry and domestic water use can each have a blue water footprint.\n\nThe \"green water footprint\" is the amount of water from precipitation that, after having been stored in the root zone of the soil (green water), is either lost by evapotranspiration or incorporated by plants. It is particularly relevant for agricultural, horticultural and forestry products.\n\nThe \"grey water footprint\" is the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants (industrial discharges, seepage from tailing ponds at mining operations, untreated municipal wastewater, or nonpoint source pollution such as agricultural runoff or urban runoff) to such an extent that the quality of the water meets agreed water quality standards. It is calculated as:\n\nwhere \"L\" is the pollutant load (as mass flux), \"c\" the maximum allowable concentration and \"c\" the natural concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water body (both expressed in mass/volume).\n\nThe water footprint of a process is expressed as volumetric flow rate of water. That of a product is the whole footprint (sum) of processes in its complete supply chain divided by the number of product units. For consumers, businesses and geographic area, water footprint is indicated as volume of water per time, in particular:\n\nThe concept of a \"water footprint\" was coined in 2002, by Arjen Hoekstra, Professor in water management at the University of Twente, Netherlands, and co-founder and scientific director of the Water Footprint Network, whilst working at the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, as a metric to measure the amount of water consumed and polluted to produce goods and services along their full supply chain. Water footprint is one of a family of ecological footprint indicators, which also includes carbon footprint and land footprint. The water footprint concept is further related to the idea of virtual water trade introduced in the early 1990's by Professor John Allan (2008 Stockholm Water Prize Laureate). The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004 report on the \"Water footprint of nations\" from UNESCO-IHE, the 2008 book \"Globalization of Water\", and the 2011 manual \"The water footprint assessment manual: Setting the global standard\". Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008.\n\nThe Water Footprint Network is an international learning community (non-profit foundation under Dutch law) that serves as a platform for sharing knowledge, tools and innovations among governments, businesses and communities that are concerned about growing water scarcity and increasing water pollution levels and their impacts on people and nature. The network consists of around 100 partners from all sectors – producers, investors, suppliers and regulators – as well as non-governmental organisations and academia. It describes its mission as follows: To provide science-based, practical solutions and strategic insights that empower companies, governments, individuals and small-scale producers to transform the way we use and share fresh water within earth’s limits.\n\nIn February 2011, the Water Footprint Network, in a global collaborative effort of environmental organizations, companies, research institutions and the UN, launched the \"Global Water Footprint Standard\". In July 2014, the International Organization for Standardization issued \"ISO 14046:2014, Environmental management—Water footprint—Principles, requirements and guidelines\", to provide practical guidance to practitioners from various backgrounds, such as large companies, public authorities, non-governmental organizations, academic and research groups as well as small and medium enterprises, for carrying out a water footprint assessment. The ISO standard is based on life-cycle assessment (LCA) principles and can be applied for different sorts of assessment of products and companies.\n\nLife-cycle assessment (LCA) is a systematic, phased approach to assessing the environmental aspects and potential impacts that are associated with a product, process or service. “Life cycle” refers to the major activities connected with the product’s life-span, from its manufacture, use, and maintenance, to its final disposal, and also including the acquisition of raw material required to manufacture the product. Thus a method for assessing the environmental impacts of freshwater consumption was developed. It specifically looks at the damage to three areas of protection: human health, ecosystem quality, and resources. The consideration of water consumption is crucial where water-intensive products (for example agricultural goods) are concerned that need to therefore undergo a life-cycle assessment. In addition, regional assessments are equally as necessary as the impact of water use depends on its location. In short, LCA is important as it identifies the impact of water use in certain products, consumers, companies, nations, etc. which can help reduce the amount of water used.\n\nThe water footprint of a product is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the product, summed over the various steps of the production chain. The water footprint of a product refers not only to the total volume of water used; it also refers to where and when the water is used. The Water Footprint Network maintains a global database on the water footprint of products: WaterStat.\n\nThe water footprints involved in various diets vary greatly, and much of the variation tends to be associated with levels of meat consumption. The following table gives some examples of estimated global average water footprints of some agricultural products.\n\nThe water footprint of a business, the 'corporate water footprint', is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used directly or indirectly to run and support a business. It is the total volume of water use to be associated with the use of the business outputs. The water footprint of a business consists of water used for producing/manufacturing or for supporting activities and the indirect water use in the producer’s supply chain.\n\nThe Carbon Trust argue that a more robust approach is for businesses to go beyond simple volumetric measurement to assess the full range of water impact from all sites. Its work with leading global pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) analysed four key categories: water availability, water quality, health impacts, and licence to operate (including reputational and regulatory risks) in order to enable GSK to quantitatively measure, and credibly reduce, its year-on-year water impact.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company operates over a thousand manufacturing plants in about 200 countries. Making its drink uses a lot of water. Critics say its water footprint has been large. Coca-Cola has started to look at its water sustainability. It has now set out goals to reduce its water footprint such as treating the water it uses so it goes back into the environment in a clean state. Another goal is to find sustainable sources for the raw materials it uses in its drinks, such as sugarcane, oranges, and corn. By making its water footprint better, the company can reduce costs, improve the environment, and benefit the communities in which it operates.\n\nThe water footprint of an individual refers to the sum of their direct and indirect freshwater use. The direct water use is the water used at home, while the indirect water use relates to the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed.\n\nThe average global water footprint of an individual is 1,385 m per year. Residents of some example nations have water footprints as shown in the table:\n\nThe water footprint of a nation is the amount of water used to produce the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of that nation. Analysis of the water footprint of nations illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution, by showing that several countries rely heavily on foreign water resources and that (consumption patterns in) many countries significantly and in various ways impact how, and how much, water is being consumed and polluted elsewhere on Earth. International water dependencies are substantial and are likely to increase with continued global trade liberalisation. The largest share (76%) of the virtual water flows between countries is related to international trade in crops and derived crop products. Trade in animal products and industrial products contributed 12% each to the global virtual water flows. The four major direct factors determining the water footprint of a country are: volume of consumption (related to the gross national income); consumption pattern (e.g. high versus low meat consumption); climate (growth conditions); and agricultural practice (water use efficiency).\n\nThe assessment of total water use in connection to consumption can be approached from both ends of the supply chain. The water footprint of production estimates how much water from local sources is used or polluted in order to provide the goods and services produced in that country. The water footprint of consumption of a country looks at the amount of water used or polluted (locally, or in the case of imported goods, in other countries) in connection with all the goods and services that are consumed by the inhabitants of that country. The water footprint of production and that of consumption, can also be estimated for any administrative unit such as a city, province, river basin or the entire world.\n\nThe absolute water footprint is the total sum of water footprints of all people. A country's per capita water footprint (that nation's water footprint divided by its number of inhabitants) can be used to compare its water footprint with those of other nations.\n\nThe global water footprint in the period 1996–2005 was 9.087 Gm3/yr (Billion Cubic Metres per year, or 9.087.000.000.000.000 liters/year), of which 74% was and green, 11% blue, 15% grey. This is an average amount per capita of 1.385 Gm3/yr., or 3.800 liters per person per day. On average 92% of this is embedded in agricultural products consumed, 4.4% in industrial products consumed, and 3.6% is domestic water use. The global water footprint related to producing goods for export is 1.762 Gm3∕y. \n\nIn absolute terms, India is the country with the largest water footprint in the world, a total of 987 Gm3/yr. In relative terms (i.e. taking population size into account), the people of the USA have the largest water footprint, with 2480 m3/yr per capita, followed by the people in south European countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain (2300–2400 m3/yr per capita). High water footprints can also be found in Malaysia and Thailand. In contrast, the Chinese people have a relatively low per capita water footprint with an average of 700 m3/yr. (These numbers are also from the period 1996-2005)\n\nThe internal water footprint is the amount of water used from domestic water resources; the external water footprint is the amount of water used in other countries to produce goods and services imported and consumed by the inhabitants of the country. When assessing the water footprint of a nation, it is crucial to take into account the international flows of virtual water (also called \"embodied water\", i.e. the water used or polluted in connection to all agricultural and industrial commodities) leaving and entering the country. When taking the use of domestic water resources as a starting point for calculating a nation’s water footprint, one should subtract the virtual water flows that leave the country and add the virtual water flows that enter the country.\n\nThe external part of a nation's water footprint varies strongly from country to country. Some African nations, such as Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi and Chad have hardly any external water footprint, simply because they have little import. Some European countries on the other hand, e.g. Italy, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands have external water footprints that constitute 50–80% of their total water footprint. The agricultural products that on average contribute most to the external water footprints of nations are: bovine meat, soybean, wheat, cocoa, rice, cotton and maize.\nThe top 10 gross virtual water exporting nations, which together account for more than half of the global virtual water export, are the United States (314 Gm3∕year), China (143 Gm3∕year), India (125 Gm3∕year), Brazil (112 Gm3∕year), Argentina (98 Gm3∕year), Canada (91 Gm3∕year), Australia (89 Gm3∕year), Indonesia (72 Gm3∕year), France (65 Gm3∕year), and Germany (64 Gm3∕year).\n\nThe top 10 gross virtual water importing nations are the United States (234 Gm3∕year), Japan (127 Gm3∕year), Germany (125 Gm3∕year), China (121 Gm3∕year), Italy (101 Gm3∕year), Mexico (92 Gm3∕year), France (78 Gm3∕year), the United Kingdom (77 Gm3∕year), and The Netherlands (71 Gm3∕year).\n\nEach EU citizen consumes 4,815 litres of water per day on average; 44% is used in power production primarily to cool thermal plants or nuclear power plants. Energy production annual water consumption in the EU 27 in 2011 was, in billion m³: for gas 0.53, coal 1.54 and nuclear 2.44. Wind energy avoided the use of 387 million cubic metres (mn m³) of water in 2012, avoiding a cost of €743 million.\n\nAlthough agriculture’s water use includes provision of important terrestrial environmental values (as discussed in the “Water footprint of products” section above), and much “green water’ is used in maintaining forests and wild lands, there is also direct environmental use (e.g. of surface water) that may be allocated by governments. For example, in California, where water use issues are sometimes severe because of drought, about 48 percent of “dedicated water use” in an average water year is for the environment (somewhat more than for agriculture). Such environmental water use is for keeping streams flowing, maintaining aquatic and riparian habitats, keeping wetlands wet, etc.\n\nAccording to Dennis Wichelns of the International Water Management Institute: \"Although one goal of virtual water analysis is to describe opportunities for improving water security, there is almost no mention of the potential impacts of the prescriptions arising from that analysis on farm households in industrialized or developing countries. It is essential to consider more carefully the inherent flaws in the virtual water and water footprint perspectives, particularly when seeking guidance regarding policy decisions.\"\n\nThe application and interpretation of water footprints may sometimes be used to promote industrial activities that lead to facile criticism of certain products. For example, the 140 litres required for coffee production for one cup might be of no harm to water resources if its cultivation occurs mainly in humid areas, but could be damaging in more arid regions. Other factors such as hydrology, climate, geology, topography, population and demographics should also be taken into account. Nevertheless, high water footprint calculations do suggest that environmental concern may be appropriate.\n\nThe use of the term \"footprint\" can also confuse people familiar with the notion of a carbon footprint, because the water footprint concept includes sums of water quantities without necessarily evaluating related impacts. This is in contrast to the carbon footprint, where carbon emissions are not simply summarized but normalized by CO emissions, which are globally identical, to account for the environmental harm. The difference is due to the somewhat more complex nature of water; while involved in the global hydrological cycle, it is expressed in conditions both local and regional through various forms like river basins, watersheds, on down to groundwater (as part of larger aquifer systems).\n\nSustainable water use involves the rigorous assessment of all source of clean water to establish the current and future rates of use, the impacts of that use both downstream and in the wider area where the water may be used and the impact of contaminated water streams on the environment and economic well being of the area. It also involves the implementation of social policies such as water pricing in order to manage water demand. In some localities, water may also have spiritual relevance and the use of such water may need to take account of such interests. For example, the Maori believe that water is the source and foundation of all life and have many spiritual associations with water and places associated with water. On a national and global scale, water sustainability requires strategic and long term planning to ensure appropriate sources of clean water are identified and the environmental and economic impact of such choices are understood and accepted. The re-use and reclamation of water is also part of sustainability including downstream impacts on both surface waters and ground waters.\n\nSeveral nations estimate sectoral distribution of use of water withdrawn from surface and groundwater sources. For example, in Canada, in 2005, 42 billion m³ of withdrawn water were used, of which about 38 billion m³ were freshwater. Distribution of this use among sectors was: thermoelectric power generation 66.2%, manufacturing 13.6%, residential 9.0%, agriculture 4.7%, commercial and institutional 2.7%, water treatment and distribution systems 2.3%, mining 1.1%, and oil and gas extraction 0.5%. The 38 billion cu.m of freshwater withdrawn in that year can be compared with the nation’s annual freshwater yield (estimated as streamflow) of 3,472 billion cu.m. Sectoral distribution is different in many respects in the US, where agriculture accounts for about 39% of fresh water withdrawals, thermoelectric power generation 38%, industrial 4%, residential 1%, and mining (including oil and gas) 1%.\n\nWithin the agricultural sector, withdrawn water use is for irrigation and for livestock. Whereas all irrigation in the US (including loss in conveyance of irrigation water) is estimated to account for about 38 percent of US withdrawn freshwater use, the irrigation water used for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9 percent, and other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector (for drinking, washdown of facilities, etc.) is estimated at about 0.7 percent. Because agriculture is a major user of withdrawn water, changes in the magnitude and efficiency of its water use are important. In the US, from 1980 (when agriculture’s withdrawn water use peaked) to 2010, there was a 23 percent reduction in agriculture’s use of withdrawn water, while US agricultural output increased by 49 percent over that period.\n\nIn the US, irrigation water application data are collected in the quinquennial Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, conducted as part of the Census of Agriculture. Such data indicate great differences in irrigation water use within various agricultural sectors. For example, about 14 percent of corn-for-grain land and 11 percent of soybean land in the US are irrigated, compared with 66 percent of vegetable land, 79 percent of orchard land and 97 percent of rice land.\n\n"}
{"id": "34740676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34740676", "title": "Zolgokh", "text": "Zolgokh\n\nZolgokh () is a traditional Mongolian formal greeting. Two people hold both their arms out, and the younger person's arms are placed under the elder person's and grasps their elbows to show support for their elder. The two people then touch each other's cheeks, usually accompanied with the phrase \"Amar mend üü\" (), meaning \"Are you well and peaceful?\".\nIn Modern contexts, the greeting is usually reserved for Tsagaan sar celebrations, where people greet each other with zolgokh, while sometimes holding a khadag and suutei tsai.\n\nZolgokh is usually first performed among family members on the morning of the festival (the husband and wife do not perform the greeting with each other). The greeting is first performed with the eldest people in the family, sometimes accompanied with a gift of money and/or khadag.\n\nThe greeting would more accurately be termed \"Zolgolt\", but the word \"Zolgokh\" has become more widespread in English. The verb form in Mongolian is \"Zolgo\", and the \"-kh\" is added to mean \"to \"zolgo\"\". The noun form of the greeting in Mongolian is thus \"Zolgolt\", the suffix \"-lt\" being added to form a noun.\n\n"}
