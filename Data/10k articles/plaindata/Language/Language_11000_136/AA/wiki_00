It is uncertain when he lived; but he appears to have been a Christian, and it is not improbable from some expressions which he uses, that he lived at the latter part of the 4th century. There are three extant works ascribed to him. \"Aggeni Urbici in Julium Frontinum Commentarius,\" a commentary upon the work \"De Agrorum Qualitate,\" which is ascribed to Frontinus. Aggenus' commentary was not well regarded by later writers; Karl Lachmann called it \"the wretched work of some Christian schoolmaster\". The other two works are \"In Julium Frontinum Commentariorum Liber secundus qui Diazographus dicitur\"; and \"Commentariorum de Controversiis Agrorum Pars prior et altera\". The latter of which Carsten Niebuhr supposes to have been actually been written by Frontinus, and in the time of Domitian, that is, the end of the 1st century, since the author speaks of \"praestantissimus Domitianus,\" an expression which some feel would be unlikely to have been applied to this tyrant after his death.\n"}
{"id": "51812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51812", "title": "Amphora", "text": "Amphora\n\nAn amphora (; Greek: ἀμφορεύς, \"amphoréus\"; English plural: amphorae or amphoras) is a type of container of a characteristic shape and size, descending from at least as early as the Neolithic Period. Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine. They are most often ceramic, but examples in metals and other materials have been found. Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in Ancient Greek vase painting. \n\nThe amphora complements the large storage container, the pithos, which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than 50 kilograms (100 lbs). The bodies of the two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs for fastening a rope harness, the amphora has two expansive handles joining the shoulder of the body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters.\n\nStoppers of perishable materials, which have rarely survived, were used to seal the contents. Two principal types of amphorae existed: the \"neck amphora\", in which the neck and body meet at a sharp angle; and the \"one-piece amphora\", in which the neck and body form a continuous curve. Neck amphorae were commonly used in the early history of ancient Greece, but were gradually replaced by the one-piece type from around the 7th century BC onward.\n\nMost were produced with a pointed base to allow upright storage by embedding in soft ground, such as sand. The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright or on their sides in as many as five staggered layers. If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with suspended solid particles, such as olive oil and wines.\n\nAmphorae are of great use to maritime archaeologists, as they often indicate the age of a shipwreck and the geographic origin of the cargo. They are occasionally so well preserved that the original content is still present, providing information on foodstuffs and mercantile systems. Amphorae were too cheap and plentiful to return to their origin-point and so, when empty, they were broken up at their destination. At a breakage site in Rome, Testaccio, close to the Tiber, the fragments, later wetted with Calcium hydroxide (Calce viva), remained to create a hill now named Monte Testaccio, high and more than 1 kilometre in circumference.\n\nAmphora is a Greco-Roman word developed in ancient Greek during the Bronze Age. The Romans acquired it during the Hellenization that occurred in the Roman Republic. Cato is the first known literary person to use it. The Romans turned the Greek form into a standard -a declension noun, \"amphora\", pl. \"amphorae\". Undoubtedly, the word and the vase were introduced to Italy through the Greek settlements there, which traded extensively in Greek pottery.\n\nIt is remarkable that even though the Etruscans imported, manufactured, and exported amphorae extensively in their wine industry, and other Greek vase names were Etruscanized, no Etruscan form of the word exists. There was perhaps an as yet unidentified native Etruscan word for the vase that pre-empted the adoption of \"amphora\".\nThe Latin word derived from the Greek \"amphoreus\" (), a shortened form of \"amphiphoreus\" (), a compound word combining \"amphi-\" (\"on both sides\", \"twain\") and \"phoreus\" (\"carrier\"), from \"pherein\" (\"to carry\"), referring to the vessel's two carrying handles on opposite sides. The amphora appears as , \"a-pi-po-re-we\", in the Linear B Bronze Age records of Knossos, , \"a-po-re-we\", at Mycenae, and the fragmentary \"]-re-we\" at Pylos, designated by , Bennett's AMPHORA, which has a number of scribal variants. The two spellings are transcriptions of amphiphorēwes (plural) and amphorēwe (dual) in Mycenaean Greek from which it may be seen that the short form prevailed on the mainland. Homer uses the long form for metrical reasons, and Herodotus has the short form. Ventris and Chadwick's translation is \"carried on both sides.\"\n\nAmphorae varied greatly in height. The largest stands as tall as 1.5 metres (5 ft) high, while some were less than 30 centimetres (12 in) high - the smallest were called amphoriskoi (literally \"little amphorae\"). Most were around 45 centimetres (18 in) high.\n\nThere was a significant degree of standardisation in some variants; the wine amphora held a standard measure of about 39 litres (41 US qt), giving rise to the amphora quadrantal as a unit of measure in the Roman Empire. In all, approximately 66 distinct types of amphora have been identified.\n\nFurther, the term also stands for an ancient Roman unit of measurement for liquids. The volume of a Roman amphora was one cubic foot, c. 26.026 L.\n\nRoman amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then left to dry partially. Then coils of clay were added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles. Once the amphora was complete, the maker then treated the interior with resin that would prevent permeation of stored liquids. The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on the study of modern amphora production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nAmphorae often were marked with a variety of stamps, sgraffito, and inscriptions. They provided information on the production, content, and subsequent marketing. A stamp usually was applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage. It indicates the name of the \"figlina\" (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, \"tituli picti\", recorded the weight of the container and the contents, and were applied after the amphora was filled.\n\nThe first systematic classification of Roman amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar Heinrich Dressel. Following the exceptional amphora deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\". In his studies of the amphora deposit he was the first to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called \"Dressel table\", which still is used today for many types.\n\nSubsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications, which usually are named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Maña published in 1951, and the revised classification by van der Werff in 1977-1978. The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989, whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat. Beltràn studied the Spanish types in 1970. Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955. For a general analysis of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella, and Peacock and Williams.\n\nCeramics of shapes and uses falling within the range of amphorae, with or without handles, are of prehistoric heritage across Eurasia, from the Caucasus to China. For example, the kvevri, common in the Republic of Georgia and the Caucasus, may be traced back to approximately 6000 BC. Amphorae dated to approximately 4800 BC have been found in Banpo, a Neolithic site of the Yangshao culture in China. Amphorae first appeared on the Phoenician coast at approximately 3500 BC.\n\nIn the Bronze and Iron Ages amphorae spread around the ancient Mediterranean world, being used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as the principal means for transporting and storing grapes, olive oil, wine, oil, olives, grain, fish, and other commodities. They were produced on an industrial scale until approximately the 7th century AD. Wooden and skin containers seem to have supplanted amphorae thereafter.\n\nThey influenced Chinese ceramics and other East Asian ceramic cultures, especially as a fancy shape for high-quality decorative ceramics, and continued to be produced there long after they had ceased to be used further west.\n\nBesides coarse amphorae used for storage and transport, the vast majority, high-quality painted amphorae were produced in Ancient Greece in significant numbers for a variety of social and ceremonial purposes. Their design differs vastly from the more functional versions; they are typified by wide mouth and a ring base, with a glazed surface and decorated with figures or geometric shapes. They normally have a firm base on which they can stand. amphorae were used as prizes in the Panathenaic Festivals held between the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC, filled with olive oil from a sacred grove. Surviving examples bear the inscription \"I am one of the prizes from Athens\", and usually depict the particular event they were awarded for. \n\nPainted amphorae were also used for funerary purposes, often in special types such as the \"loutrophoros\". Especially in earlier periods, outsize vases were used as grave markers, while some amphorae were used as containers for the ashes of the dead. By the Roman period vase-painting had largely died out, and utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.\n\nVarious different types of amphorae were popular at different times:\n\nOn a neck amphora, the handles are attached to the neck, which is separated from the belly by an angular carination. There are two main types of neck amphorae:\nThere are also some rarer special types of neck amphora, distinguished by specific features, for example:\n\nIn contrast to the neck amphora, a belly amphora does not have a distinguished neck; instead the belly reaches the mouth in a continuous curve. After the mid-5th century BC, this type was rarely produced. The \"pelike\" is a special type of belly amphora, with the belly placed lower, so that the widest point of the vessel is near its bottom. The \"pelike\" was introduced around the end of the 6th century BC.\n\nAnother special type is the Panathenaic prize amphora, with black-figure decoration, produced exclusively as prize vessels for the Panathenaia and retaining the black-figure technique for centuries after the introduction of red-figure vase painting. Some examples bear the inscription \"ΤΩΝ ΑΘΗΝΗΘΕΝ ΑΘΛΩΝ\" meaning \"[I am one] of the prizes from [the goddess] Athena\". They contained the prize of oil from the sacred olive tree of the goddess Athena for the winners of the athletic contests held to honour the goddess, and were evidently kept thereafter, and perhaps used to store wine, before being buried with the prize-winner. They depicted goddess Athena on one side (as seen on the second image on this page) and the athletic event on the other side, e.g. a scene of wrestling or running contest etc.\nBy the Roman period utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.\n\nThe first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC. This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, although also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so-called Dressel 2-4 starts to become widely used. This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6000 Dressel 2-4 in the same space.</ref> Dressel 2-4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which quickly ceased to be used.\n\nAt the same time in Cuma (southern Italy) the production of the \"cadii cumani\" type starts (Dressel 21-22). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called Spello amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times.\n\nIn the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2-4, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in Marseille during late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types. Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in late Republican times. The \"Hispania Baetica\" and \"Hispania Tarraconensis\" regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC due to the distribution of land to military veterans and the founding of new colonies. Spanish amphorae were widespread in the Mediterranean area during early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in Baetica and among these there were the Dressel 20, a typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7-13, for garum (fish sauce), and the Haltern 70, for defrutum (fruit sauce). In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped on the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2-4.\n\nNorth-African production was based on an ancient tradition which may be traced back to the Phoenician colony of Carthage. Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions, which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in Tripolitania and Northern Tunisia are the Maña C1 and C2, later renamed van Der Werff 1, 2, and 3. In the Aegean area the types from the island of Rhodes were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC due to local wine production which flourished over a long period. These types developed into the \"Camulodunum\" 184, an amphora used for the transportation of Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2-4 were produced on the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th century BC until middle imperial times. Cretan containers also were popular for the transportation of wine and can be found around the Mediterranean from Augustan times until the 3rd century AD. During the late empire period, north-African types dominated amphora production. The so-called African I and II types were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased.\n\nSome modern winemakers and brewers are using amphoras to provide a different palate and tastes to their products than are available with other aging methods.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "367085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367085", "title": "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", "text": "Atlantis: The Lost Empire\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire is a 2001 American animated science fantasy action adventure film created by Walt Disney Feature Animation—the first science fiction film in Disney's animated features canon and the 41st overall. Written by Tab Murphy, directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and produced by Don Hahn, the film features an ensemble cast with the voices of Michael J. Fox, Cree Summer, James Garner, Leonard Nimoy, Don Novello, Phil Morris, Claudia Christian, Jacqueline Obradors, Jim Varney (in his final role before his death), Florence Stanley, John Mahoney, David Ogden Stiers and Corey Burton. Set in 1914, the film tells the story of a young man who gains possession of a sacred book, which he believes will guide him and a crew of mercenaries to the lost city of Atlantis.\n\nDevelopment of the film began after production had finished on \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1996). Instead of another musical, the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of Jules Verne. \"Atlantis\" was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator Mike Mignola. At the time of its release, the film had made greater use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any of Disney's previous traditionally animated features; it remains one of the few to have been shot in anamorphic format. Linguist Marc Okrand created a language specifically for use in \"Atlantis\", with James Newton Howard providing the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from hand-drawn animation toward films with full CGI.\n\n\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on June 3, 2001, and went into general release on June 15. Released by Walt Disney Pictures, \"Atlantis\" performed modestly at the box office. Budgeted at around , the film grossed over worldwide, of which was earned in North America. Due to the film's lackluster box office performance, Disney quietly canceled both a spin-off television series and an underwater attraction at its Disneyland theme park. Some critics praised it as a unique departure from typical Disney animated features, while others disliked it due to the unclear target audience and absence of songs. \"Atlantis\" was nominated for a number of awards, including seven Annie Awards, and won Best Sound Editing at the 2002 Golden Reel Awards. The film was released on VHS and DVD on January 29, 2002; the Blu-ray released on June 11, 2013. \"Atlantis\" is considered to be a cult favorite, due in part to Mignola's unique artistic influence. A direct-to-video sequel, \"\", was released in 2003.\n\nMany centuries ago, a tsunami threatens to drown the island of Atlantis. In the midst of an evacuation from the capital city, the Queen of Atlantis is caught by a strange, hypnotic blue light and lifted up into the \"Heart of Atlantis\", a powerful crystal protecting the city. The crystal consumes her and creates a dome barrier that protects the city's innermost district. She leaves behind her young daughter, Princess Kida, as the island sinks beneath the ocean.\n\nIn 1914, Milo Thatch, a cartographer and linguist at the Smithsonian Institution who is marginalized for his research on Atlantis, believes that he has found The Shepherd's Journal, an ancient manuscript that contains directions to the lost island. Though the museum board declines his proposal to search for the journal, a mysterious woman, Helga Sinclair, introduces Milo to Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire. Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's grandfather, recruiting Milo to lead an expedition to Atlantis, as soon as he receives it.\n\nThe expedition departs with a team of specialists led by Commander Lyle Rourke, who also led the journal recovery expedition. They set out in the \"Ulysses\", a massive submarine. During the journey, they are attacked by the monstrous Leviathan, a robotic lobster-like creature that guards Atlantis' entrance. The \"Ulysses\" is subsequently destroyed, but Milo, Rourke, and part of the crew escape to an underground cavern, described in the journal as the entrance to Atlantis.\n\nAfter traveling through a network of caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis, where they are greeted by Kida. However, Kida's father, the King of Atlantis, is not pleased with the team's visit, but agrees with Rourke for a one-night stay. Kida enlists Milo in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By diving deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.\n\nReturning to the surface with Kida, Milo discovers Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the crew betray Milo, intending to bring the crystal to the surface and sell it. Rourke mortally wounds the King while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds it himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. The crystal detects a threat and merges with Kida, whom Rourke and the mercenaries lock in a crate, and then prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when the crystal is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates the crew for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that the crystal has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective emotions of the Atlanteans and will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted to use it as a weapon of war. As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Milo rallies the crew and Atlanteans to stop Rourke.\n\nIn the ensuing battle inside the volcano, Helga, and the accomplices die, while Rourke is destroyed after turning into a rock monster and being chopped by the propeller. Milo and the others successfully fly the crystal back to the city, as the volcano erupts. With lava flowing towards the city, Kida (in her crystal form) rises into the air and creates a protective shield. The lava freezes and breaks away harmlessly, showing a restored Atlantis, and the crystal returns Kida to Milo. The surviving crew members return to the surface and promise to keep the discovery of Atlantis a secret. Having fallen in love with Kida, Milo becomes the new king of Atlantis, along with Kida as the new queen, and stays behind to help her rebuild the lost empire.\n\n\nThe idea for \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" was conceived in October 1996 when Don Hahn, Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise, and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in Burbank, California. Having recently completed \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" the producer and directors wanted to keep the \"Hunchback\" crew together for another film with an Adventureland setting. Drawing inspiration from Jules Verne's \"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\" (1864), they set out to make a film which would fully explore Atlantis (compared to the brief visit depicted in Verne's novel). While primarily utilizing the Internet to research the mythology of Atlantis, the filmmakers became interested in the clairvoyant readings of Edgar Cayce and decided to incorporate some of his ideas—notably that of a mother-crystal which provides power, healing, and longevity to the Atlanteans—into the story. They also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early 20th century (the film's time period), and traveled 800 feet underground in New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would serve as a model for the approach to Atlantis in the film.\n\nThe filmmakers wanted to avoid the common depiction of Atlantis as \"crumbled Greek columns underwater\", said Wise. \"From the get-go, we were committed to designing it top to bottom. Let's get the architectural style, clothing, heritage, customs, how they would sleep, and how they would speak. So we brought people on board who would help us develop those ideas.\" Art director David Goetz stated, \"We looked at Mayan architecture, styles of ancient, unusual architecture from around the world, and the directors really liked the look of Southeast Asian architecture.\" The team later took ideas from other architectural forms, including Cambodian, Indian, and Tibetan works. Hahn added, \"If you take and deconstruct architecture from around the world into one architectural vocabulary, that's what our Atlantis looks like.\" The overall design and circular layout of Atlantis were also based on the writings of Plato, and his quote \"in a single day and night of misfortune, the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depths of the sea\" was influential from the beginning of production. The crew wore T-shirts which read \"ATLANTIS—Fewer songs, more explosions\" due the film's plan as an action-adventure (unlike previous Disney animated features, which were musicals).\n\nMarc Okrand, who developed the Klingon language for the \"Star Trek\" films, was hired to devise the Atlantean language for \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\". Guided by the directors' initial concept for it to be a \"mother-language\", Okrand employed an Indo-European word stock with its own grammatical structure. He would change the words if they began to sound too much like an actual, spoken language. John Emerson designed the written component, making hundreds of random sketches of individual letters from among which the directors chose the best to represent the Atlantean alphabet. The written language was boustrophedon: designed to be read left-to-right on the first line, then right-to-left on the second, continuing in a zigzag pattern to simulate the flow of water.\n\nJoss Whedon was the first writer to be involved with the film but soon left to work on other Disney projects. According to him, he \"had not a shred\" in the movie. Tab Murphy completed the screenplay, stating that the time from initially discussing the story to producing a script that satisfied the film crew was \"about three to four months\". The initial draft was 155 pages, much longer than a typical Disney film script (which usually runs 90 pages). When the first two acts were timed at 120 minutes, the directors cut characters and sequences and focused more on Milo. Murphy said that he created the centuries-old \"Shepherd's Journal\" because he needed a map for the characters to follow throughout their journey. A revised version of the script eliminated the trials encountered by the explorers as they navigated the underground caves to Atlantis. This gave the film a faster pace because Atlantis is discovered earlier in the story.\n\nThe character of Milo J. Thatch was originally supposed to be a descendant of Edward Teach, otherwise known as Blackbeard the pirate. The directors later related him to an explorer so he would discover his inner talent for exploration. The character of Molière was originally intended to be \"professorial\" but Chris Ure, a story artist, changed the concept to that of a \"horrible little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with extending eyeballs\", said Wise. Don Hahn pointed out that the absence of songs presented a challenge for a team accustomed to animating musicals, as solely action scenes would have to carry the film. Kirk Wise said it gave the team an opportunity for more on-screen character development: \"We had more screen time available to do a scene like where Milo and the explorers are camping out and learning about one another's histories. An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed. That is not typically something we would have the luxury of doing.\"\n\nHahn stated that the first animated sequence completed during production was the film's prologue. The original version featured a Viking war party using \"The Shepherd's Journal\" to find Atlantis and being swiftly dispatched by the Leviathan. Near the end of production, story supervisor Jon Sanford told the directors that he felt this prologue did not give viewers enough emotional involvement with the Atlanteans. Despite knowing that the Viking prologue was finished and it would cost additional time and money to alter the scene, the directors agreed with Sanford. Trousdale went home and completed the storyboards later that evening. The opening was replaced by a sequence depicting the destruction of Atlantis, which introduced the film from the perspective of the Atlanteans and Princess Kida. The Viking prologue is included as an extra feature on the .\n\nAt the peak of its production, 350 animators, artists and technicians were working on \"Atlantis\" at all three Disney animation studios: Walt Disney Feature Animation (Burbank, California), Disney Feature Animation Florida (Orlando), and Disney Animation France (Paris). The film was one of the few Disney animated features produced and shot in 70mm anamorphic format. The directors felt that a widescreen image was crucial, as a nostalgic reference to old action-adventure films presented in the CinemaScope format (2.35:1), noting \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" as an inspiration. Because switching to the format would require animation desks and equipment designed for widescreen to be purchased, Disney executives were at first reluctant about the idea. The production team found a simple solution by drawing within a smaller frame on the same paper and equipment used for standard aspect ratio (1.66:1) Disney-animated films. Layout supervisor Ed Ghertner wrote a guide to the widescreen format for use by the layout artists and mentioned that one advantage of widescreen was that he could keep characters in scenes longer because of additional space to walk within the frame. Wise drew further inspiration for the format from filmmakers David Lean and Akira Kurosawa.\n\nThe film's visual style was strongly based upon that of Mike Mignola, the comic book artist behind \"Hellboy\". Mignola was one of four production designers (along with Matt Codd, Jim Martin, and Ricardo Delgado) hired by the Disney studio for the film. Accordingly, he provided style guides, preliminary character and background designs, and story ideas. \"Mignola's graphic, angular style was a key influence on the 'look' of the characters,\" stated Wise. Mignola was surprised when first contacted by the studio to work on \"Atlantis\". His artistic influence on the film would later contribute to a cult following.\nThe final pull-out scene of the movie, immediately before the end-title card, was described by the directors as the most difficult scene in the history of Disney animation. They said that the pullout attempt on their prior film, \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", \"struggled\" and \"lacked depth\"; however, after making advances in the process of multiplaning, they tried the technique again in \"Atlantis\". The scene begins with one 16-inch (40.5 cm) piece of paper showing a close-up of Milo and Kida. As the camera pulls away from them to reveal the newly restored Atlantis, it reaches the equivalent of an 18,000-inch (45,720 cm) piece of paper composed of many individual pieces of paper (24 inches [61 cm] or smaller). Each piece was carefully drawn and combined with animated vehicles simultaneously flying across the scene to make the viewer see a complete, integrated image.\nAt the time of its release, \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" was notable for using more computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any other Disney traditionally animated feature. To increase productivity, the directors had the digital artists work with the traditional animators throughout the production. Several important scenes required heavy use of digital animation: the Leviathan, the \"Ulysses\" submarine and sub-pods, the Heart of Atlantis, and the Stone Giants. During production, after Matt Codd and Jim Martin designed the \"Ulysses\" on paper, Greg Aronowitz was hired to build a scale model of the submarine, to be used as a reference for drawing the 3D \"Ulysses\". The final film included 362 digital-effects shots, and computer programs were used to seamlessly join the 2D and 3D artwork. One scene that took advantage of this was the \"sub-drop\" scene, where the 3D \"Ulysses\" was dropped from its docking bay into the water. As the camera floated toward it, a 2D Milo was drawn to appear inside, tracking the camera. The crew noted that it was challenging to keep the audience from noticing the difference between the 2D and 3D drawings when they were merged. The digital production also gave the directors a unique \"virtual camera\" for complicated shots within the film. With the ability to operate in the z-plane, this camera moved through a digital wire-frame set; the background and details were later hand-drawn over the wire frames. This was used in the opening flight scene through Atlantis and the submarine chase through the undersea cavern with the Leviathan in pursuit.\n\nSince the film would not feature any songs, the directors hired James Newton Howard to compose the score. Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard decided to have different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would have a number of key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen.\n\nGary Rydstrom and his team at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film's sound production. Like Howard, Rydstrom employed different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, he felt that the Atlanteans should have a \"more organic\" sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a semi-truck drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a water pick.\n\n\"Atlantis\" was among Disney's first major attempts to utilize internet marketing. The film was promoted through Kellogg's, which created a website with mini-games and a movie-based video game give-away for UPC labels from specially marked packages of \"Atlantis\" breakfast cereal. The film was one of Disney's first marketing attempts through mobile network operators, and allowed users to download games based on the film. McDonald's (which had an exclusive licensing agreement on all Disney releases) promoted the film with Happy Meal toys, food packaging and in-store decor. The McDonald's advertising campaign involved television, radio, and print advertisements beginning on the film's release date. Frito-Lay offered free admission tickets for the film on specially marked snack packages.\n\nBefore the film's release, reporters speculated that it would have a difficult run due to competition from DreamWorks' \"Shrek\" (a wholly CGI feature) and \"\" (an action-adventure film from Paramount Pictures). Regarding the market's shift from traditional animation and competition with CGI films, Kirk Wise said, \"Any traditional animator, including myself, can't help but feel a twinge. I think it always comes down to story and character, and one form won't replace the other. Just like photography didn't replace painting. But maybe I'm blind to it.\" Jeff Jensen of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted that CGI films (such as \"Shrek\") were more likely to attract the teenage demographic typically not interested in animation, and called \"Atlantis\" a \"marketing and creative gamble\".\n\n\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" had its world premiere at Disney's El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on June 3, 2001 and a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on June 8; a wider release followed on June 15. At the premiere, \"Destination: Atlantis\" was on display, featuring behind-the-scenes props from the film and information on the legend of Atlantis with video games, displays, laser tag, and other attractions. The Aquarium of the Pacific also loaned a variety of fish for display within the attraction. With a budget of $100 million, the film opened at #2 on its debut weekend, behind \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\" earning $20.3 million in 3,011 theaters. The film's international release began September 20 in Australia and other markets followed suit. During its 25-week theatrical run, \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" grossed over $186 million worldwide ($84 million from the United States and Canada). Responding to its disappointing box-office performance, Thomas Schumacher, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, said, \"It seemed like a good idea at the time to not do a sweet fairy tale, but we missed.\"\n\n\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" was released on VHS and DVD January 29, 2002. During the first month of its home release, the film led in VHS sales and was third in VHS and DVD sales combined. Sales and rentals of the VHS and DVD combined would eventually accumulate $157 million in revenue by mid-2003. Both a single-disc DVD edition and a two-disc collector's edition (with bonus features) were released. The single-disc DVD gave the viewer the option of viewing the film either in its original theatrical 2.35:1 aspect ratio or a modified 1.33:1 ratio (utilizing pan and scan). Bonus features available on the DVD version included audio and visual commentary from the film team, a virtual tour of the CGI models, an Atlantean-language tutorial, an encyclopedia on the myth of Atlantis, and the deleted Viking prologue scene. The two-disc collector's edition DVD contained all the single-disc features and a disc with supplemental material detailing all aspects of the film's production. The collector's-edition film could only be viewed in its original theatrical ratio, and also featured an optional DTS 5.1 track. Both DVD versions, however, contained a Dolby Digital 5.1 track and were THX certified. Disney digitally remastered and released \"Atlantis\" on Blu-ray on June 11, 2013, bundled with its sequel \"\".\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49% of 141 professional critics have given \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" a positive review; the average rating is 5.5/10. The site's consensus is: \"\"Atlantis\" provides a fast-paced spectacle, but stints on such things as character development and a coherent plot\". Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 29 reviews from mainstream critics; this was considered \"mixed or average reviews\". CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinema-goers gave \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" was an \"A\" on an A+-to-F scale.\n\nWhile critics had mixed reactions to the film in general, some praised it for its visuals, action-adventure elements, and its attempt to appeal to an older audience. Roger Ebert gave \"Atlantis\" three-and-half stars out of four. He praised the animation's \"clean bright visual look\" and the \"classic energy of the comic book style\", crediting this to the work of Mike Mignola. Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote, \"The story of \"Atlantis\" is rousing in an old pulp science fiction sort of way, but the climactic scene transcends the rest, and stands by itself as one of the great animated action sequences.\" In \"The New York Times\", Elvis Mitchell gave high praise to the film, calling it \"a monumental treat\", and stated, \"\"Atlantis\" is also one of the most eye-catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four-fingered glove.\" Internet film critic James Berardinelli wrote a positive review of the film, giving it three out of four stars. He wrote, \"On the whole, \"Atlantis\" offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment, once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live-action movies, they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division.\" Wesley Morris of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote positively of the film's approach for an older audience: \"But just beneath the surface, \"Atlantis\" brims with adult possibility.\"\n\nOther critics felt that the film was mediocre in regards to its story and characters, and that it failed to deliver as a non-musical to Disney's traditional audience. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a C+ rating, writing that the film had \"gee-whiz formulaic character\" and was \"the essence of craft without dream\". Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the storyline and characterizations were \"old-fashioned\" and the film had the retrograde look of a Saturday-morning cartoon, but these deficiencies were offset by its \"brisk action\" and frantic pace. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" wrote, \"Disney pushes into all-talking, no-singing, no-dancing and, in the end, no-fun animated territory.\" Stephanie Zacharek of \"Salon\" wrote of Disney's attempt to make the film for an adult audience, \"The big problem with Disney's latest animated feature, \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\", is that it doesn't seem geared to kids at all: It's so adult that it's massively boring.\" Rita Kempley of \"The Washington Post\" panned the film, calling it a \"new-fashioned but old-fangled hash\" and wrote, \"Ironically Disney had hoped to update its image with this mildly diverting adventure, yet the picture hasn't really broken away from the tried-and-true format spoofed in the far superior \"Shrek\".\"\n\nSeveral critics and scholars have noted that \"Atlantis\" plays strongly on themes of anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism. M. Keith Booker, academic and author of studies about the implicit messages conveyed by media, views the character of Rourke as being motivated by \"capitalist greed\" when he pursues \"his own financial gain\" in spite of the knowledge that \"his theft [of the crystal] will lead to the destruction of [Atlantis]\". Religion journalist Mark Pinsky, in his exploration of moral and spiritual themes in popular Disney films, says that \"it is impossible to read the movie ... any other way\" than as \"a devastating, unrelenting attack on capitalism and American imperialism\". Max Messier of FilmCritic.com observes, \"Disney even manages to lambast the capitalist lifestyle of the adventurers intent on uncovering the lost city. Damn the imperialists!\" According to Booker, the film also \"delivers a rather segregationist moral\" by concluding with the discovery of the Atlanteans kept secret from other surface-dwellers in order to maintain a separation between the two highly divergent cultures. Others saw \"Atlantis\" as an interesting look at utopian philosophy of the sort found in classic works of science fiction by H. G. Wells and Jules Verne.\n\nWhen the film was released, some viewers noticed that \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" bore a number of similarities to the 1990–1991 Japanese anime television program \"\" and the 1986 film \"Castle in the Sky\" from Studio Ghibli, particularly in its character design, setting, and story. Although Disney never responded formally to claims of plagiarism, co-director Kirk Wise posted on a Disney animation newsgroup in May 2001, \"Never heard of \"Nadia\" till it was mentioned in this [newsgroup]. Long after we'd finished production, I might add.\" Both \"Atlantis\" and \"Nadia\" were inspired, in part, by the 1870 Jules Verne novel \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\", of which Lee Zion (reporting for Anime News Network) wrote, \"There are too many similarities \"not\" connected with \"20,000 Leagues\" for the whole thing to be coincidence.\" Critics also saw parallels with the 1994 film \"Stargate\". Milo's characteristics were said to resemble those of Daniel Jackson, the protagonist of \"Stargate\" and its spinoff television series \"Stargate SG-1\"—which coincidentally launched its own spinoff, titled \"Stargate Atlantis\".\n\n\"Atlantis: the Lost Empire\" was meant to provide a springboard for an animated television series entitled \"Team Atlantis\", which would have presented the further adventures of its characters. However, because of the film's under-performance at the box office, the series was not produced. On May 20, 2003, Disney released a direct-to-video sequel called \"\", consisting of three episodes planned for the aborted series. In addition, Disneyland planned to revive its Submarine Voyage ride with an \"Atlantis\" theme with elements from the movie and the ride was promoted with a meet-and-greet by the movie's characters. These plans were canceled and the attraction was re-opened in 2007 as the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, its theme based on the 2003 Disney·Pixar animated film \"Finding Nemo\".\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" was released on May 22, 2001. It consists primarily of James Newton Howard's score and includes \"Where the Dream Takes You\", written by Howard and Diane Warren and performed by Mýa. It was also available in a limited edition of 20,000 numbered copies with a unique 3D album cover insert depicting the Leviathan from the film. A rare promotional edition (featuring 73 minutes of material, compared to the 53 minutes on standard commercial editions) was intended only for Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters but was bootlegged and distributed with fan-created artwork. Concerning the promotional edition, Filmtracks said, \"Outside of about five minutes of superior additional material (including the massive opening, \"Atlantis Destroyed\"), the complete presentation is mostly redundant. Still, \"Atlantis\" is an accomplished work for its genre.\"\n\nThere are several video games based on the film. \"\" (commonly known as \"Atlantis: Search for the Journal\") was developed by Zombie Studios and published by Buena Vista Games, a subsidiary of Disney Interactive. It was released on May 1, 2001, for the Microsoft Windows platform and was a first-person shooter game, the first of two games based on the film developed by Zombie Studios and released for UPC labels from Kellogg's products for promotion. \"\" (commonly known as \"Atlantis: Trial by Fire\") was the second game developed by Zombie Studios and published by Disney Interactive, and was released May 18, 2001, for the Microsoft Windows platform.\n\n\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" is an action game developed by Eurocom for the PlayStation console which was released June 14, 2001. The player controls Milo, Audrey, Molière, Kida and Vinny as they traverse Atlantis, unlocking its secrets. Some features in the game unlock others (such as a movie) by finding items hidden throughout the game. THQ released \"Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" for the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color. It is a platform game in which the player controls Milo and three other characters from the film across 14 levels on a quest to discover Atlantis. The game was met with average to mixed reviews upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 74% and 73 out of 100 for the PlayStation version; 65% for the Game Boy Color version; and 56% and 51 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version.\n\n"}
{"id": "12810360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12810360", "title": "Ballet blanc", "text": "Ballet blanc\n\nIn ballet, a ballet blanc (, \"white ballet\") is a scene in which the ballerina and the female \"corps de ballet\" all wear white dresses or tutus. Typical in the Romantic style of ballet from the nineteenth century, \"ballets blancs\" are usually populated by ghosts, dryads, naiads, enchanted maidens, fairies, and other supernatural creatures and spirits.\n\nA precursor of the genre was \"Ballet of the Nuns\", an episode in act 3 of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera \"Robert le Diable\". The ghosts of cloistered nuns who, in life, were unfaithful to their vows are summoned from their graves to tempt the hero, Robert, with dancing, gambling, drink, and love making. Choreographed by Filippo Taglioni and first presented in Paris in November 1831, it starred his daughter, Marie Taglioni, as Helena, the abbess of the ruined convent of Saint Rosalia. Costumes in modern productions are usually white dresses with black sashes and headpieces.\n\nThe next year, 1832, Marie Taglioni appeared in the title role of \"La Sylphide\", the story of a wood nymph (a sylphide) who tempts a Scottish farmer, James, to abandon his rural sweetheart and follow her into the woods, in pursuit of ethereal beauty. Dance historians consider this work, as the first fully-fledged \"ballet blanc\", to be the beginning of the Romantic movement in ballet. The name of the genre is derived from the white costume designed by Eugène Lami for Taglioni, which became the recognized dress for dancers of the academic school. The skirt of the Romantic tutu is either mid-calf or ankle length in design. Despite the introduction of Romantic elements of otherworldly spirits, the dancing in \"La Sylphide\" was of the purely classical school.\n\nGhosts, shades, shadows, spirits, and other elemental beings dominated ballet stages for decades after \"La Sylphide\". Famous \"ballets blancs\" were staged in act 2 of \"Giselle\" (1842), in acts 2 and 4 of \"Swan Lake\" (1877/1895), in act 2 of \"La Bayadère\" (1877), and in act 1 of \"The Nutcracker\" (1892). In modern productions, dancers in the lakeside scenes of \"Swan Lake\" and the Kingdom of the Shades scene of \"La Bayadère\" sometimes wear short, classical tutus rather than the traditional calf-length or ankle-length ballet dresses, but the visually stunning effect of the \"ballet blanc\" is undiminished. In 1908, Michel Fokine revived the genre in a ballet set to the music of Frédéric Chopin that he entitled \"Chopiniana\". When a revised version was presented in Paris in 1909 by the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev, it was given the more Romantic title of \"Les Sylphides\". It has remained a popular staple of the ballet repertory for the past century and more.\n"}

Examples of common classes of biological targets are proteins and nucleic acids. The definition is context-dependent, and can refer to the biological target of a pharmacologically active drug compound, the receptor target of a hormone (like insulin), or some other target of an external stimulus.

In this context, the biological target is often referred to as a drug target. The most common drug targets of currently marketed drugs include:\n\n\nIdentifying the biological origin of a disease, and the potential targets for intervention, is the first step in the discovery of a medicine using the reverse pharmacology approach. Potential drug targets are not necessarily disease causing but must by definition be disease modifying. An alternative means of identifying new drug targets is forward pharmacology based on phenotypic screening to identify \"orphan\" ligands whose targets are subsequently identified through target deconvolution.\n\nDatabases containing biological targets information:\n\nThese biological targets are conserved across species, making pharmaceutical pollution of the environment a danger to species who possess the same targets. For example, the synthetic estrogen in human contraceptives, 17-R-ethinylestradiol, has been shown to increase the feminization of fish downstream from sewage treatment plants, thereby unbalancing reproduction and creating an additional selective pressure on fish survival. Pharmaceuticals are usually found at ng/L to lowµg/L concentrations in the aquatic environment. Adverse effects may occur in non-target species as a consequence of specific drug target interactions. Therefore, evolutionarily well-conserved drug targets are likely to be associated with an increased risk for non-targeted pharmacological effects.\n\n"}
{"id": "53086307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53086307", "title": "Bong (term)", "text": "Bong (term)\n\nBong is a neologism that originated in cosmopolitan India in the 1980s as a slightly pejorative exonym for the educated middle-class Bengalis from the Indian state of West Bengal. In the 21st century, the term became a self-appellation of pride through the use of satire and self-reflexive irony by the Bengali blogging community, which came to stand for the Bengali Hindu people as a whole. Bong has been noted as a word of Indian English, used in the Indian newspapers.\n\nThe usage of Bong as an ethnic quip has been noted in the India Today in 1989. Sociologist Prasanta Roy has noted that the word was used in New Delhi in the 1990s. According to lexicographer Ashoke Mukhopadhyay, Bong is a distortion of the word Bengali that originated among the NRIs. Writer Nabarun Bhattacharya believed that the term originated either in the IITs or some other pan-Indian educational institutes. According to a 1999 report in The Indian Express, the gradual extinction of Bengali language and culture and the growing cosmopolitanism in Kolkata have resulted in Bengalis called Bongs by the non-Bengalis. According to blogger Arnab Ray, the Bengalis were traditionally reluctant to leave West Bengal for livelihood. However, in the 1980s, the political scenario changed in West Bengal and the Bengalis were forced to leave the state in search of better career options. This led to the development of Bong identity, which is characterized by their emotional attachment towards West Bengal and at the same time well integrated with the cosmopolitan environment of India and abroad.\n\nLexicographer Ashoke Mukhopadhyay believes that the term is slightly pejorative. It has a similar pejorative term as the Hindi term 'Bongali babu' (literally meaning educated Bengali gentleman). According to sociologist Prasanta Roy, the term conveys hostility, prejudice, political and intellectual dislike. Nabarun Bhattacharya believed that the term was used to tease the Bengalis, who themselves harboured chauvinistic attitude towards others. According to the 1999 report in The Indian Express, the Bengalis disliked the term.\n\nIn the 21st century, the use of Bong has gained currency among the young generation of West Bengal. Bengali bloggers re-invented their social identity as Bongs. Through satire they have turned the derisive term as a marker of their own ethnic identity. Filmmaker Anjan Dutt believes that Bengalis are okay with calling themselves Bongs. He used the term Bong instead of Bengali for the title of his 2006 film The Bong Connection because it was something that can be used with jest just like Yank. According to him terms like Bong or Yank stand for certain quirks and attributes of the person coming from a particular region. According to New Delhi-based writer Samit Basu, the people who identify themselves as Bong should fight against the age-old stereotypes of the Bengalis. Bengalis had become proud to be known as Bong, as it was no longer an offensive parochial label.\n\nBong is generally perceived to stand for the global cosmopolitan Bengali. Blogger Arnab Ray believes that Bong stands for the globalized Bengali. According to a Bengali civil servant who blogs as Sadoldbong, Bong stands for the Bengali in exile. However, according to Anjan Dutt, there is no cultural or generation gap between the Bong and the Bengali identity.Blogger Sandeepa Mukherjee Datta who blogs as Bong Mom in Bong Mom's Cook Book describes Bong as an identity limited to the Bengali people of West Bengal. Durga Puja has been described as a Bong festival. The prohibition on eating the seasonal Indian plum before the Saraswati Puja has been referred to as Bong cultural heritage.\n\nBong is listed as a notable word in Indian English. Contemporary Indian English uses several words that are derived from Bong. Examples include Bongdom (Bengali domination), Bongness (attachment to Bengali culture), Bonglish (pidgin Indian English consisting of Bengali loanwords), hon-Bong (abbreviation for honorary Bong, a person who is not a Bong, but can be considered a Bong by virtue of his/her acquaintance and closeness to Bongs and Bong culture).\n\nThe Bengali Hindus as Bongs are often stereotyped especially in Bollywood and the Internet. A popular Internet joke goes like this. One Bengali is a poet, two Bengalis are a film society, three Bengalis are a political party and four Bengalis are two political parties! One common stereotype is that Bongs are invariably fish eaters and often referred to as \"Machher Jhol\", literally meaning fish curry in Bengali.\n\n"}

Even then, the authors considered the notion could be extended to other types of prepositional complements such as: \n- \"moi-même\" ‘myself’ in \"J’ai fait ça (de/par) moi-même\" ‘I have done this myself’, where a redundant reflexive pronoun reinstates the subject NP; or\n- in \"J’ai un apartment à moi\" ‘I have my own apartment/I have an apartment of my own’, where a redundant/emphatic oblique pronoun (in French) recovers both the subject NP and the possession relation of avoir ‘to have’. The same term and analysis are more recently retaken by Laporte (2004).\n\nIn another work (Guillet and Leclère 1992, p. 109), the authors use the term in yet another syntactic setting, v.g. \"mettre du beurre sur\" = \"beurrer\" ‘to put butter over/on = to butter’, where \"mettre\" 'put' is analysed as a support-verb. This relation, however, could correspond to the \"Fusion\" operation. Theoretical considerations apart, the relevant observation is that the verbal sentence allows a prepositional complement with the noun whence the verb is derived (V-n). This complements usually zeroed unless it is given a specifying modifier, e.g. \"Max beurre sa tar tine de de beurre (salé/de ferme)\" ‘Max buttered his toast with salted/farm butter’.\n\nThe term has been adopted for Portuguese by Baptista (2005b, pp. 157–162), to name apparently facultative human complements introduced by compound preposition \"para com\" ‘towards’ (lit:‘for with’), in support verb constructions, e.g. \"O gesto do Pedro para com o João foi de uma grande delicadeza\" = \"O gesto do Pedro foi de uma grande delicadeza para com o João\" ‘Peter’s gesture towards John was of great delicacy = Peter’s gesture was of great delicacy towards John’. \nNevertheless, in the same work (Baptista 2005b, p. 165), when referring to the distinction between symmetrical and reciprocal constructions, calls the type of complement here addressed, \"pronominal copy\".\n\nWhile other authors, namely Guillet and Leclère (1992), Laporte (2004), and Baptista (2005a,b), may have used the term \"echo complement\" to describe different linguistic phenomena, and apparently have not used it for the specific type of complement here addressed, the term could fit the first definition provided by Guillet and Leclère (1981, pp. 116–117). Though briefly noted, the term was then used to designate a type of prepositional complement that “renders more “precise” while recovering, at least partially, the meaning of the utterance” (our translation).\n\nMore recently (Baptista 2005a), the term was used for anaphoric expressions in reciprocal constructions, analysable as the result of the reduction of two coordinated sentences with same predicate but with two constituents in symmetrical position:\n\n\"Peter talked with John and John talked with Peter\" → \"Peter and John talked with each other\"\n"}

{"id": "2531784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2531784", "title": "Franciszka Arnsztajnowa", "text": "Franciszka Arnsztajnowa\n\nFranciszka Arnsztajnowa (; in full: \"Franciszka Hanna Arnsztajnowa\"; 19 February 1865 – August 1942) was a Polish poet, playwright, and translator of Jewish descent. Much of her creative \"oeuvre\" falls within the Young Poland period, stylistically encompassing the twilight of neo-romanticism. She is called \"the legend of Lublin\".\n\nFranciszka Arnsztajnowa was the daughter of the Lublin-based novelist Malwina Meyerson (real name, Małka Meyerson, \"née\" Horowicz (Horowitz); 18391921), a Lublin native, and Bernard (Berek, or Ber) Meyerson (b. 1837), a native of Tykocin, an international trader and a major Lublin financier. Her brother was the French philosopher, Émile Meyerson, based in Paris. She attended high school for girls in Lublin, and went to Germany for higher studies in biology, travelling extensively in Europe. On 7 January 1885 she married Marek Arnsztein (alternative spellings: Arnsztejn, Arnsztajn, Arnstein; 18551930), a physician educated in Warsaw, Vienna, Berlin, and Paris, and a political and social activist, a native of Kazimierz Dolny based in Lublin from 1884. They had a daughter, Stefanja Arnsztajnówna (\"c.\"18901942; married name Mieczysławska), and a son, Jan Arnsztajn (18971934), much beloved of Arnsztajnowa and whose death from tuberculosis left her devastated.\n\nAs a poet Arnsztajnowa debuted at the age of 23 with the poem \"Na okręcie\" (On Board a Ship) published in the newspaper \"Kuryer Codzienny\" of 1 October 1888. She issued her first collection of poetry in book form in 1895 under the title \"Poezye\", a volume which she dedicated to her mother, the novelist Malwina Meyerson. The book is divided into six distinct sections under such headings as \"Sonety\" (Sonnets), \"Melodye\" (Melodies), \"Historye\" (Histories), and \"Z gór Tyrolu\" (From the Mountains of Tyrol). The opening poem, untitled but beginning with the words \"O nie płacz...\" (Weep thou not...; p. 7), sets the tone for the entire collection as she tries, with uncommon tenderness and filial piety, to soothe her mother's pain at having her own songs dispersed by the winds of time to the farthermost recesses of the soul: the implication is that the poems in this collection will become her mother's own, which the daughter will now sing for her, the lute in hand, sitting at her feet. (In the very last poem of the collection the poet again addresses her mother directly, \"O mother, why give me a heart so | Tender...\") The chief characteristic of the collection, thematically speaking, was however the preoccupation and love she evinced for the people living close to the land, their ordinary lives and folkloric customs. At the same time she delicately touched upon the social questions of the day employing language in the balladic-melancholic key. The volume will instantly establish Arnsztajnowa as a major voice in Polish poetry among those exploring the nation's folk themes.\n\nHer next collection appeared in 1899 under the title \"Poezye: serya druga\" (\"Verses: Second Series\"; 2nd ed., 1911). The latter volume contains the poem \"Z nocy bezsennych\" (Out of the Sleepless Nights) dedicated to her husband, Marek Arnsztein, as well as the memorable \"Wspomnienie Meranu\" (A Remembrance of Merano) that evokes her travels in the Trentino-Alto Adige region of Italy, and which begins:\n<poem>\n\"Meran… pamiętam… nieraz dziś w zimy rozgwarze,\n\"Mroźnem tchnieniem owiana, nagle zamknę oczy,\n\"I o błogosławionej dolinie zamarzę.\"\n__________________________________\n\nMeran… I recall… as nowadays oft by winter's clamorous decree\nFrosty gusts me shroud, I soon close my eyes asudden\nAnd slip down the blessed valley into reverie.\n</poem>\n\nWacław Gralewski (19001972), a poet and prominent Lublin \"littérateur\", cites a report (which he qualifies as uncorroborated) that Arnsztajnowa was supposed to undergo a (successful) therapy for tuberculosis at Merano, an option open only to the very rich.\n\nDuring the First World War Arnsztajnowa (\"nom de guerre\" Ara) participated in armed struggle for the independence of Poland as a member of the secret Polish Military Organisation in Lublin (her town house in the Old Town of Lublin served as a secret archive of the POW and a hub for other organizations, such as the Union of Armed Struggle and the clandestine Polish boy scout movement; the expansive basement served as an arsenal). Some of the patriotic feelings and motivations that actuated her participation in the freedom struggle will later find an echo in her collection of poetry entitled \"Archanioł jutra\" (\"The Archangel of the Morrow\"), comprising verses written during the war, which she will publish in 1924 dedicating it to the alumni of the Lublin schools who had fallen in that struggle. With two compositions included in the volume Arnsztajnowa paid tribute to the luminaries of Polish literature, Marja Konopnicka and Bolesław Prus, both recently deceased then. However, it is to Stefan Żeromski (after \"his\" death in 1925) that Arnsztajnowa will in the latter part of her life acknowledge her indebtedness for the general character of her \"oeuvre\" and the direction she followed in creating it.\n\n\"Archanioł jutra\" contains verses of great strength and incisiveness, unparalleled in her prior work, the composition \"O Dniu Jutrzejszy\" (O, Thou Day of the Morrow!), written in 1914, belonging to the most beautiful among them in the opinion of the historian of literature, Feliks Araszkiewicz. The poem speaks of the brethren's (comrades-in-arms') blood shed in the struggle, whose rising vapours conceal the mystery of tomorrow (the day is personified in the poem, addressed as \"you\", and conceived of as a day of reckoning, indeed, as a metonymy for retributive justice itself): the mystery of tomorrow will be revealed once we tear down your deadly veil to look you directly in the face, without the sort of fear that makes the victim bow his head before the executioner: for tomorrow we know full well will be the day of payback for today. (The poem, heavily dependent on stylized linguistics and medieval vocabulary (e.g., \"gzło\", line 3, a medieval term for a kind of female garment, here used figuratively in the sense of \"veil\"), does not lend itself easily to verse translation but is reproduced in the original to the left.) Thus the archangel of the title of the entire collection, \"Archanioł jutra\" (“The Archangel of the Morrow”), can easily be construed as the avenging angel.\n\nAnother composition belonging to this period is the poem entitled \"Powrót\" (The Return) published in a literary journal in April 1916. Comprising five \"ottava rima\" stanzas, the 40-line poem brought her the Silver Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature, a (now historical) body awarding the most prestigious literary honours of the land at the time.\n\nDuring the Interbellum Arnsztajnowa collaborated with the newspapers and literary magazines \"Dziennik Lubelski\", \"Kamena\", and \"Kurjer Lubelski\"; she was the editor-in-chief of the literary supplement \"Dodatek Literacki\" to the newspaper \"Ziemia Lubelska\". At the same time she was the moving spirit of the literary life of the city of Lublin, a fact recognized by outside observers, co-founding in 1932, together with the poet Józef Czechowicz, the Lublin section of the writers' union, the Związek Literatów (see Polish Writers' Union), of which she served as the president. To this period, in addition to the aforementioned collection \"Archanioł jutra\" (1924), belong also her volumes of poetry entitled \"Odloty\" (\"Flying Away\"; 1932), a compilation of verses published in literary journals between 1902 and 1926, and the collection produced jointly with Józef Czechowicz, \"Stare kamienie\" (\"Old Stones\"; 1934) which was at once a tribute to her beloved Lublin, a city in which she continued to reside until 1934, epitomized in the poem \"Tobie śpiewam, Lublinie\" (To You do I Sing, O Lublin!), and a form of a literary farewell. Contemporary critics observed that the unspecified nature of the collaboration between the two famous poets gave the publication an anonymous tinge, and although subsequent scholarship clearly differentiated between the pieces written by Arnsztajnowa and those written by Czechowicz mistakes of attribution did occur in succeeding years and decades.\n\n\"Odloty\" represents a continuation of the modernist esthetics that dominated the first phase of Arnsztajnowa's literary life, as evidenced in the imagery employed and in the method of shaping of the lyrical persona, as well as in the return of the fairy-tale motifs favoured by the Young Poland poets, such as lakes, mirrors, and shadows. Although on occasion she adopts a new cadence closer to the spirit of the Skamander circle then gaining an ascendancy over Polish poetics, such diversions are rare. The title poem, \"Odloty\" (Flying Away), first printed in a literary magazine in 1905, is a mystical allegory on the inevitability of the departure, of parting despite the ties thereby shattered.\n\nArnsztajnowa was co-founder of the historically important Kraków periodical \"Życie\" famously associated with the artistic avant-garde and with the person of Stanisław Przybyszewski, for which she wrote a programmatic poem, and had close ties to the literary magazine \"Kamena\" (see ), founded and edited by K. A. Jaworski: the journal began publication in 1933 with a poem by Arnsztajnowa, \"Na Olejnej\" (In Olejna Street), on the first page of the first issue.\n\nRight-wing critics (such as Juljan Babiński, 19001943) accused Arnsztajnowa of left-wing bias against the \"szlachta\", in favour of the common people.\n\nArnsztajnowa's innumerable writings in prose, strewn across innumerable journals and magazines, frequently published under pseudonyms that even Arnsztajnowa could not keep track of during her lifetime, present an impossible task for a compiler wishing to present a reasonably comprehensive picture of her bibliography as observed by the historian of literature and her contemporary, Feliks Araszkiewicz (18951966). Among the pen-names she is known to have used are J. Górecka, and Stefan Orlik.\n\nArnsztajnowa's dramatic works remain largely confined to manuscript, including her award-winning play \"Na wyżynach (Krystyna)\" (\"On the Heights: Christina\") which was staged to great acclaim in Lvov in 1899. Her other plays which were seen on the stages of Kraków and Łódź, in addition to those of Lublin and Lvov, but which remain unpublished, are (with dates of theatre production) \"Na kuracji\" (\"A Stay at a Spa\"; 1894), \"Perkun\" (\"Perkūnas\"; 1896), and \"W stojącej wodzie\" (\"In the Stagnant Water\"; 1901). Only two one-act plays have been published (in literary journals), \"Widmo: Ballada w I akcie\" (\"The Spectre: A Ballad in One Act\"; published in \"Ateneum\" in 1905, a dialogue between two characters identified only as male and female), and \"Luxoniolo\" (published in the \"Kurjer Lubelski\" in 1911). The play \"Córka\" (\"The Daughter\") has never been staged or published.\n\nArnsztajnowa participated in the women's suffrage movement, supporting with readings from her poems the meetings and events of organizations involved in the movement, including the Związek Równouprawnienia Kobiet Polskich (Union for the Equal Rights of Polish Women) founded in 1907 by Paulina Kuczalska-Reinschmit (18591921). In 1912 Arnsztajnowa participated in a feminist exhibition mounted by Polish women writers in Prague.\n\nApart from her own extensive poetic \"oeuvre\", Arnsztajnowa produced several translations from English literature. Her translation of Douglas Jerrold's famous \"\", published in 1923 as \"Nauki małżeńskie pani Caudle\", was issued with the name of the translator concealed under a pseudonym (Stefan Orlik) as she did not wish to lend the prestige that her name enjoyed in the domain of poetry to what she considered to be her avocation. Her translations of H. G. Wells's \"The Sea Lady: A Tissue of Moonshine\" (published as \"Syrena: księżycowa opowieść\" in 1927), and of W. Somerset Maugham's novel \"The Painted Veil\" (published as \"Malowana zasłona\" in 1935, 2 vols.), were issued with the name of the translator fully identified. She also collaborated with Helena Niemirowska in the translation of Rudyard Kipling's \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" (published as \"Puk\" in 1924) for which she provided verse translations. Despite their being overshadowed by the larger translations of whole novels, Professor Araszkiewicz considered Arnsztajnowa's translations of those relatively small poetic fragments and not the large bodies of prose translation to be among her most notable achievements in the field. Her versions of Kipling's \"Cities and Thrones and Powers\" and \"Harp Song of the Dane Women\" (poems from \"Puck of Pook's Hill\") were published separately in literary magazines. Similarly, her 1932 translation of a 12-verse excerpt from the French of \"Les Stances\" by Jean Moréas (Book 3; XII), beginning\n<poem>\n\"O toi qui sur mes jours de tristesse et d'épreuve\n</poem>\nreads better than the original:\n<poem>\n\"O, ty, co dni mych smutkom i zmaganiom\n\"blaskiem przyświecasz wytrwałym...\"\n</poem>\n\nAlways respectful of and ready to honour others for their achievement in their field, in 1899 Arnsztajnowa contributed to the \"liber amicorum\" for Aleksander Świętochowski on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his editorial work, a sumptuously produced volume that opens with her poem \"Grajek\" (The Fiddler; from the \"Poezye\" of 1895). Some of her tributes in verse, even when marked by a high level of artistic accomplishment, were entirely private, meant solely for the honouree. Her poem composed in tribute to the Polish geographer, Wacław Nałkowski (18511911), the father of the writer Zofja Nałkowska, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his scholarly work in January 1903, did not come to light until 55 years later, for example. Her patriotic feelings found expression in the contribution she made to the collective volume published by the Teachers' Union to commemorate the school strikes in Partitioned Poland mounted in protest against marginalization of Polish culture by the occupying powers; while in 1935 Arnsztajnowa served on the editorial board of a commemorative volume for the Polish Military Organisation, to which she contributed the keynote poem (on the theme of the Unknown Soldier) serving as a motto for the publication.\n\nArnsztajnowa's patriotic fervour carried her so far as to contribute three technically accomplished, genuinely high-calibre poems \"Jego Imię\" (His Name), \"O, Wodzu!\" (O Leader!), and \"Wodzowi-twórcy\" (To the Leader-Creator) to the collection of panegyrics in honour of Józef Piłsudski published in 1924, two years before his \"coup d'état\" of May 1926. Among the 33 contributors to the collection (some of them not established poets), only the names of Józef Czechowicz, Jan Lechoń and Kazimierz Tetmajer stand in the same rank with Arnsztajnowa's. After the \"coup d'état\" of May 1926, during a visit to Lublin in June 1931 of Piłsudski's figurehead president, Ignacy Mościcki, she wrote in poetic prose a fulsome welcome for him in a local newspaper (\"whole streets are running out to Him with open arms while ancient city walls silvered by age reverberate with the Good News: hail Thou the visible manifestation of the Independence!\", etc.).\n\nIn 1910 and 1911 Arnsztajnowa was the object of a book boycott motivated by antisemitic sentiment and spearheaded by the Endecja circles.\n\nIn the summer of 1937 Arnsztajnowa, then a 72-year-old \"grande dame\" of Polish literature (a recipient of the Silver Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature and a decorated veteran of the Polish war of independence), was the victim of antisemitic attacks from the Endecja literary circles connected with the literary magazine \"Prosto z mostu\" of Warsaw, a publication billing itself in the masthead as an artistic-literary weekly, edited and published by Stanisław Piasecki (19001941). In its edition of 25 July 1937 the magazine in question carried a quasi-anonymous racist and in parts scurrilously versified polemic signed only \"(st. p.)\" (which would have been universally understood by readers to refer to Piasecki) in which Arnsztajnowa was called, sarcastically, the \"erector of the edifice of the Polish language\" (\"sc.\", one of the primary forces shaping the mother tongue) without being Polish. Although other Polish writers of Jewish descent were held up to ridicule by name as well, Arnsztajnowa was selected for special treatment. \"Consider this efflorescence of Polish speech from under the \"aegis\" of Arnsztajnowa\", jeered the writer of the article, presenting his readers with a sentence taken out of context from one of Arnsztajnowa's articles (on the complex subject of the phenomenology of contemporary French culture), which was supposed to offend against linguistic norm (it had, in fact, a typographical error involving the omission of a single letter). The attack on Arnsztajnowa continued under the guise of an attack on Ludwik Fryde (19121942), despite his young age already a distinguished literary critic of Jewish descent, whose surname was altered to \"frydek\" so that it might rhyme with \"żydek\" (\"the little jew\", the lower-case initials employed for their added insulting value) while the author went on: \"so it is among us that every common-or-garden pederast, if he has talent, he bandies it about\", etc. The incident generated a groundswell of support for her from the Polish reading public, including an open letter signed by many writers and poets, some of whom also published individual expressions of support as did, for example, Józef Łobodowski, calling the attack \"outrageous and revolting\".\n\nAfter Łobodowski's protest published in the most prestigious literary journal of the interbellum epoch, the \"Wiadomości Literackie\", Piasecki remained unrepentant, and a fresh antisemitic attack on Arnsztajnowa was printed with additional vitriol in the \"Prosto z mostu\" edition of 8 August 1937. The antisemitic and homophobic attack on Arnsztajnowa and others was originally authored by Jerzy Pietrkiewicz and published in the ultra-nationalist and antisemitic periodical \"Myśl Narodowa\" (\"National Thought\"), but \"Prosto z mostu\" went beyond the text of the original racist pasquinade in its attempt to disseminate, defend and justify it. For its part \"Myśl Narodowa\" will continue its attack on Arnsztajnowa on other fronts, bemoaning (in its issue of 29 August 1937) \"the pernicious Jewish dispensation (\"gospodarka żydów\") in the field of literature\" for which the evidence was to be the supposed falsification by Niemirowska and Arnsztajnowa of Kipling (through their alleged toning down or expurgation of antisemitic passages in the works of this author).\n\nPublished sources differ on the circumstances of her death, but there is a consensus that she did not die in Lublin, all the sources citing the Warsaw Ghetto a place where she had gone proudly \"and of her own accord\", \"to be with everybody\" as either the place of her death or the place of her deportation immediately before her death. In some accounts she would have died in the Warsaw Ghetto of an infectious disease (typhus); according to other accounts she would have been violently murdered there by the Nazis, or have taken poison out of despair after seeing her daughter, Stefanja (who in all accounts accompanied her in the Warsaw Ghetto), shot dead by the Nazis. In some sources she would have been murdered after having been deported from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp (the most common narrative, but not invested with greater evidentiary credibility than the other versions). Most authorities agree that she died in 1942, at the age of 77, however one otherwise well informed writer cites 1943 as the year of her death. In what is perhaps the most reliable eyewitness report, that of the poet Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa (19051968), at the moment of her death during the mass murder of patients at a hospital near All Saints' Church in Warsaw where she lay ill Arnsztajnowa had two books with her, Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" and her own collection of poetry published in 1932, \"Odloty\" (\"Flying Away\"), on the poetics of departure.\n\nArnsztajnowa's first book, \"Poezye\" (1895), published when she was 30, contains this reference to Dante Alighieri:\n<poem>\n\"I ja byłem w piekle… we śnie, czy na jawie\n\"Niewiem… lecz, zaprawdę, Danta piekieł kręgi\n\"Mąk takich nie mieszczą, nie szarpią tak krwawie…\"\n___________________________\n\nTo hell I've also been… in dream or waking hours\nCan't say… but, forsooth, Dante's infernal circles\nContain not such torment as bloodily overpowers…\n</poem>\n\nFranciszka Arnsztajnowa was decorated by the government of the Second Polish Republic with the Cross of Valour (\"Krzyż Walecznych\"), the Cross of Independence (\"Krzyż Niepodległości\"), as well as the Knight's Cross (\"Krzyż Kawalerski\") of the Order of Polonia Restituta, one of the country's highest honours. She was the recipient of the Silver Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature in 1936. She has a street named after herself in Lublin, the ulica Franciszki Arnsztajnowej.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As such the standardized registers of the Hindustani language (Hindi-Urdu) share a common vocabulary, especially on the colloquial level. However, in formal speech, Hindi tends to draw on Sanskrit, while Urdu turns to Persian and sometimes Arabic. This difference lies in the history of Hindustani, in which the Khariboli dialect started to gain more Persian words in urban areas (such as Lucknow and Hyderabad), under the Delhi Sultanate; this dialect came to be termed Urdu.\n\nThe original Hindi dialects continued to develop alongside Urdu and according to Professor Afroz Taj, \"the distinction between Hindi and Urdu was chiefly a question of style. A poet could draw upon Urdu's lexical richness to create an aura of elegant sophistication, or could use the simple rustic vocabulary of dialect Hindi to evoke the folk life of the village. Somewhere in the middle lay the day to day language spoken by the great majority of people. This day to day language was often referred to by the all-encompassing term \"Hindustani\".\" In Colonial India, Hindi-Urdu acquired vocabulary introduced by Christian missionaries from the Germanic and Romanic languages, e.g. \"pādrī\" (Devanagari: पादरी, Nastaleeq: پادری) from \"padre\", meaning pastor.\n\nWhen describing the state of Hindi-Urdu under the British Raj, Professor Śekhara Bandyopādhyāẏa stated that \"Truly speaking, Hindi and Urdu, spoken by a great majority of people in north India, were the same language written in two scripts; Hindi was written in Devanagari script and therefore had a greater sprinkling of Sanskrit words, while Urdu was written in Persian script and thus had more Persian and Arabic words in it. At the more colloquial level, however, the two languages were mutually intelligible.\" After the partition of India, political forces within India tried to further Sanskritize Hindi, while political forces in Pakistan campaigned to remove Prakit/Sanksrit derived words from Urdu and supplant them with Persian and Arabic words. Despite these government efforts, the film industry, Bollywood continues to release its films in the original Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) language, easily understood and enjoyed by speakers of both registers; in addition many of the same television channels are viewed across the border.\n\nHindi (हिन्दी \"Hindi\") is one of the Indo-Aryan languages of the Indo-European language family. The core of Hindi vocabulary is thus etymologically Indo-European. However, centuries of borrowing has led to the adoption of a wide range of words with foreign origins.\n\nThe typical Hindi dictionary lists 75,000 separate words, of which 50,000 (30%) are considered तत्सम \"tatsama\" (words directly reborrowed from Sanskrit), 21,100 (28%) are तद्भव \"tadbhav\" (native Hindi vocabulary with Sanskrit cognates), and the rest being borrowings from देशज \"deshaj\" \"indigenous\" (i.e. Austroasiatic) or विदेशी \"Videshi\" \"foreign\" sources.\n\nHowever, these figures do not take into account the fact that a huge chunk of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimizing their actual usage. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of native \"tadbhabo\" words, while \"tatshamo\" reborrowings only make up 25% of the total. \"Deshaj\" and \"Videshi\" borrowings together make up the remaining 15% of the vocabulary used in modern Hindi literature.\n\nDue to centuries of contact with Europeans, Turkic peoples, Arabs, Persians, and East Asians, Hindi has absorbed countless words from foreign languages, often totally integrating these borrowings into the core vocabulary. The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. Close contact with neighboring peoples facilitated the borrowing of words from other Indian languages, Chinese, Burmese, and several indigenous Austroasiatic languages of North India. After centuries of invasions from Persia and the Middle East, particularly under the Mughal Empire, numerous Turkish, Arabic, and Persian words were absorbed and fully integrated into the lexicon.

{"id": "17507782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17507782", "title": "Kakistocracy", "text": "Kakistocracy\n\nA kakistocracy () is a system of government which is run by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous citizens. The word was coined as early as the seventeenth century. It also was used by English author Thomas Love Peacock in 1829, but gained significant use in the first decades of the twenty-first century to criticize populist governments emerging in different democracies around the world.\n\nThe word is derived from two Greek words, \"kakistos\" (; worst) and \"kratos\" (; rule), with a literal meaning of government by the worst people. Linguistic equivalents of the English word \"kakistocracy\" are as follows: its Greek equivalent is \"kakistokratia\" (), Catalan \"caquistocràcia\", Spanish \"kakistocracia\", French \"kakistocratie\", German \"Kakistokratie\", and Russian \"kakistokratiya\" ().\n\nThe earliest use of the word dates to the seventeenth century, in Paul Gosnold's \"A sermon Preached at the Publique Fast the ninth day of Aug. 1644 at St. Maries:\"\"Therefore we need not make any scruple of praying against such: against those Sanctimonious Incendiaries, who have fetched fire from heaven to set their Country in combustion, have pretended Religion to raise and maintaine a most wicked rebellion: against those Nero's, who have ripped up the wombe of the mother that bare them, and wounded the breasts that gave them sucke: against those Cannibal's who feed upon the flesh and are drunke with the bloud of their own brethren: against those Catiline's who seeke their private ends in the publicke disturbance, and have set the Kingdome on fire to rost their owne egges: against those tempests of the State, those restlesse spirits who can no longer live, then be stickling and medling; who are stung with a perpetuall itch of changing and innovating, transforming our old Hierarchy into a new Presbytery, and this againe into a newer Independency; and our well-temperd Monarchy into a mad kinde of Kakistocracy. Good Lord!\"\n\nEnglish author Thomas Love Peacock later used the term in his 1829 novel \"The Misfortunes of Elphin\", in which he explains kakistocracy represents the opposite of aristocracy, as \"aristos\" (ἄριστος) means \"excellent\" in Greek. In his 1838 \"Memoir on Slavery\" (which he supported), U.S. Senator William Harper compared kakistocracy to anarchy, and said it had seldom occurred:\n\nAmerican poet James Russell Lowell used the term in 1876, in a letter to Joel Benton, writing, \"What fills me with doubt and dismay is the degradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of Democracy? Is ours a 'government of the people by the people for the people,' or a Kakistocracy rather, for the benefit of knaves at the cost of fools?\"\n\nUse of the word was rare in the early part of the 20th century, but it regained popularity in 1981 with criticism of the Reagan administration. Since then it has been employed to negatively describe various governments around the world. It was frequently used by conservative commentator Glenn Beck to describe the Obama administration.\n\nThe word returned to use during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, particularly by opponents and critics of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nIn May 2016, academic and blogger Amro Ali argued that kakistocracy was a word that needed to be revived.\"Salon\" would later credit Ali's blog post with initiating a wider conversation on the term.\n\nIn August 2016, Dan Leger of the Halifax newspaper \"The Chronicle Herald\" suggested that a Trump victory in the U.S. presidential election would require renewed use of the term \"kakistocracy.\"\n\nSince November 2016, the word has been used to describe the Trump administration by critics of that administration on multiple occasions.\n\nOn 29 June 2017, \"Merriam-Webster\" reported that searches for the word on its online dictionary had spiked to an all-time high that day. \"The Washington Post\" reported on the use of the word going viral to describe the Trump administration on 13 April 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "9705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9705", "title": "Languages of Europe", "text": "Languages of Europe\n\nMost languages of Europe belong to the Indo-European language family. \nOut of a total population of 744 million (as of 2018), some 94% are native speakers of an Indo-European language;\nwithin Indo-European, the three largest phyla are Slavic, Romance and Germanic, with more than 200 million speakers each, between them accounting for close to 90% of Europeans. Smaller phyla of Indo-European found in Europe include Hellenic (Greek, c. 10 million), Baltic (c. 7 million), Albanian (c. 5 million), Indo-Aryan (Romani, c. 1.5 million) and Celtic (including Welsh, c. 1 million). \n\nOf c. 45 million Europeans speaking non-Indo-European languages, around 20 million each fall within the Uralic and Turkic families. Still smaller groups (such as Basque and various languages of the Caucasus) account for less than 1% of European population between them. Immigration has added sizeable communities of speakers of African and Asian languages, amounting to about 4% of the population, with Arabic being the most widely spoken of them.\nFive languages have more than 50 million native speakers in Europe: Russian, German, French, Italian and English. While Russian has the largest number of native speakers (more than 100 million in Europe), English in Europe has the largest number of speakers in total, including some 200 million speakers of English as a second language.\n\nThe Indo-European language family is descended from Proto-Indo-European, which is believed to have been spoken thousands of years ago. Early speakers of Indo-European daughter languages most likely expanded into Europe with the incipient Bronze Age, around 4,000 years ago (Bell-Beaker culture). \n\nSlavic languages are spoken in large areas of Central Europe, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. An estimated 250 million Europeans are native speakers of Slavic languages, the largest groups being \nRussian (c. 110 million in European Russia and adjacient parts of Eastern Europe, Russian forming the largest linguistic community in Europe), \nPolish (c. 55 million),\nUkrainian (c. 40 million), \nSerbo-Croatian (c. 21 million),\nCzech (c. 11 million),\nBulgarian (c. 9 million), \nSlovak (c. 5 million)\nBelarusian and Slovene (c. 3 million each)\nand Macedonian (c. 2 million).\n\nPhylogenetically, Slavic is divided into three subgroups:\n\nRoughly 225 million Europeans (primarily in Southern and Western Europe) are native speakers of Romance languages, the largest groups including\nFrench (c. 76 million),\nItalian (c. 65 million),\nSpanish (Castilian) (c. 40 million), \nRomanian (c. 25 million),\nPortuguese (c. 10 million),\nSicilian (c. 5 million, also subsumed under Italian),\nCatalan (c. 4 million),\nGalician (c. 2 million),\nSardinian (c. 1 million),\nOccitan (c. 500,000),\nbesides numerous smaller communities.\n\nThe Romance languages are descended from varieties of Vulgar Latin spoken in the various parts of the Roman Empire in Late Antiquity. Latin was itself part of the (otherwise extinct) Italic branch of Indo-European.\nRomance is divided phylogenetically into Italo-Western, Eastern Romance (including Romanian) and Sardinian. The Romance-speaking area in Europe is often referred to as Latin Europe.\n\nItalo-Western in turn has the sub-branches Italo-Dalmatian (sometimes grouped with Eastern Romance), including Tuscan-derived Italian and numerous local Romance lects in Italy as well as Dalmatian, and the Western Romance languages.\n\nThe Western Romance languages in turn separate into:\n\nThe Germanic languages make up the predominant language family in northwestern Europe.\nAn estimated 200 million Europeans are native speakers of Germanic languages, the largest groups being German (c. 95 million), English (c. 65 million) and Dutch (c. 24 million), Swedish (c. 10 million), Danish (c. 6 million) and Norwegian (c. 5 million). \n\nThere are two extant major sub-divisions: West Germanic and North Germanic. A third group, East Germanic, is now extinct; the only known surviving East Germanic texts are written in the Gothic language.\nWest Germanic is divided into Anglo-Frisian (including English), Low German and Low Franconian (including Dutch) and High German (including Standard German).\n\n\nGerman is spoken throughout Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the East Cantons of Belgium, much of Switzerland (including the northeast areas bordering on Germany and Austria) and northern Italy (South Tyrol).\n\nThere are several groups of German dialects:\n\nLow German (including Low Saxon) is spoken in various regions throughout Northern Germany and the North and East of the Netherlands. It is an official language in Germany. \nIt may be separated into Low Saxon (West Low German) and East Low German.\n\nDutch is spoken throughout the Netherlands, northern Belgium, as well as the Nord-Pas de Calais region of France, and around Düsseldorf in Germany. In Belgian and French contexts, Dutch is sometimes referred to as Flemish. Dutch dialects are varied and cut across national borders. \n\n\nThe Anglo-Frisian language family is now mostly represented by English (Anglic), descended from the Old English language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons:\nThe Frisian languages are spoken by about 500,000 Frisians, who live on the southern coast of the North Sea in the Netherlands and Germany. These languages include West Frisian, Saterlandic, and North Frisian.\n\nThe North Germanic languages are spoken in Scandinavian countries and include Danish (Denmark), Norwegian (Norway), Swedish (Sweden and parts of Finland), or Elfdalian (in a small part of central Sweden), Faroese (Faroe Islands), and Icelandic (Iceland).\n\nEnglish has a long history of contact with Scandinavian languages, given the immigration of Scandinavians early in the history of Britain, and has similar structure with Scandinavian languages.\n\n\n\n\n\nUralic is native to northern Eurasia. Finno-Ugric groups the Uralic languages other than Samoyedic. \nFinnic languages include Finnish and Estonian. The Sami languages are closely related to Finnic.\n\nThe Ugric languages are represented in Europe with the Hungarian language, historically introduced with the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin of the 9th century.\n\nThe Samoyedic Nenets language is spoken in Nenets Autonomous Okrug in the far northeastern corner of Europe (as delimited by the Ural Mountains).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Middle Ages the two most important defining elements of Europe were \"Christianitas\" and \"Latinitas\". Thus language—at least the supranational language—played an elementary role.\nThe earliest dictionaries were glossaries, i.e., more or less structured lists of lexical pairs (in alphabetical order or according to conceptual fields). The Latin-German (Latin-Bavarian) \"Abrogans\" was among the first. A new wave of lexicography can be seen from the late 15th century onwards (after the introduction of the printing press, with the growing interest in standardizing languages).\n\nThe concept of the nation state begins to emerge in the early modern period. Nations adopted particular dialects as their national language. This, together with improved communications, led to official efforts to standardise the national language, and a number of language academies were established (e.g., 1582 \"Accademia della Crusca\" in Florence, 1617 \"Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft\" in Weimar, 1635 \"Académie française\" in Paris, 1713 \"Real Academia Española\" in Madrid). Language became increasingly linked to nation as opposed to culture, and was also used to promote religious and ethnic identity (e.g., different Bible translations in the same language for Catholics and Protestants).\n\nThe first languages for which standardisation was promoted included Italian (\"questione della lingua\": Modern Tuscan/Florentine vs. Old Tuscan/Florentine vs. Venetian → Modern Florentine + archaic Tuscan + Upper Italian), French (the standard is based on Parisian), English (the standard is based on the London dialect) and (High) German (based on the dialects of the chancellery of Meissen in Saxony, Middle German, and the chancellery of Prague in Bohemia (\"Common German\")). But several other nations also began to develop a standard variety in the 16th century.\n\nEurope has had a number of languages that were considered linguae francae over some ranges for some periods according to some historians. Typically in the rise of a national language the new language becomes a lingua franca to peoples in the range of the future nation until the consolidation and unification phases. If the nation becomes internationally influential, its language may become a lingua franca among nations that speak their own national languages. Europe has had no lingua franca ranging over its entire territory spoken by all or most of its populations during any historical period. Some linguae francae of past and present over some of its regions for some of its populations are:\n\n\nHistorical attitudes towards linguistic diversity are illustrated by two French laws: the Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts (1539), which said that every document in France should be written in French (neither in Latin nor in Occitan) and the Loi Toubon (1994), which aimed to eliminate anglicisms from official documents. States and populations within a state have often resorted to war to settle their differences. There have been attempts to prevent such hostilities: two such initiatives were promoted by the Council of Europe, founded in 1949, which affirms the right of minority language speakers to use their language fully and freely. The Council of Europe is committed to protecting linguistic diversity. Currently all European countries except France, Andorra and Turkey have signed the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, while Greece, Iceland and Luxembourg have signed it, but have not ratified it; this framework entered into force in 1998. Another European treaty, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, was adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the Council of Europe: it entered into force in 1998, and while it is legally binding for 24 countries, France, Iceland, Italy, Macedonia, Moldova and Russia have chosen to sign without ratifying the convention.\n\n \nThe main scripts used in Europe today are the Latin and Cyrillic. \n\nThe Greek alphabet was derived from the Phoenician alphabet, and Latin was derived from the Greek via the Old Italic alphabet. In the Early Middle Ages, Ogham was used in Ireland and runes (derived the Old Italic script) in Scandinavia. Both were replaced in general use by the Latin alphabet by the Late Middle Ages. The Cyrillic script was derived from the Greek with the first texts appearing around 940 AD.\nAround 1900 there were mainly two typeface variants of the Latin alphabet used in Europe: Antiqua and Fraktur. Fraktur was used most for German, Estonian, Latvian, Norwegian and Danish whereas Antiqua was used for Italian, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese, English, Romanian, Swedish and Finnish. The Fraktur variant was banned by Hitler in 1941, having been described as \"Schwabacher Jewish letters\". Other scripts have historically been in use in Europe, including Phoenician, from which modern Latin letters descend, Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs on Egyptian artefacts traded during Antiquity various runic systems used in Northern Europe preceding Christianisation, and Arabic during the era of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHungarian rovás was used by the Hungarian people in the early Middle Ages, but it was gradually replaced with the Latin-based Hungarian alphabet when Hungary became a kingdom, though it was revived in the 20th century and has certain marginal, but growing area of usage since then.\n\nThe European Union (as of 2016) had 28 member states accounting for a population of 510 million, or about 69% of the population of Europe. \n\nThe European Union has designated by agreement with the member states 24 languages as \"official and working:\" Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish. This designation provides member states with two \"entitlements:\" the member state may communicate with the EU in the designated one of those languages and view \"EU regulations and other legislative documents\" in that language.\n\nThe European Union and the Council of Europe have been collaborating in education of member populations in languages for \"the promotion of plurilingualism\" among EU member states, The joint document, \"Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR)\", is an educational standard defining \"the competencies necessary for communication\" and related knowledge for the benefit of educators in setting up educational programs. \nIn a 2005 independent survey requested by the EU's Directorate-General for Education and Culture regarding the extent to which major European languages were spoken in member states. The results were published in a 2006 document, \"Europeans and Their Languages\", or \"Eurobarometer 243\". In this study, statistically relevant samples of the population in each country were asked to fill out a survey form concerning the languages that they spoke with sufficient competency \"to be able to have a conversation\".\n\nThe following is a table of European languages.

It was established in 1935, in honour of Lawrence Campbell, a famous teacher of elocution in various schools in Sydney, in the early twentieth century. Between 2006 and 2013, in all but one year (2009), the competition was won by a student in year 11. At the 2015 World University Debating Championships in Malaysia, three of the eight speakers in the Grand Final (representing Sydney, Oxford, and Harvard) were former Lawrence Campbell winners – a testament to the quality of the Lawrence Campbell competition.\n\nThe Lawrence Campbell Oratory is widely regarded as the most prestigious, and difficult of the New South Wales Public Speaking Competitions. Each candidate is required to give a speech of eight minutes length of one of three topics given to him or her 15 minutes beforehand. In this competition, the emphasis is on oratory, the art of speech, and so the manner of delivery counts at least equally with the subject matter. The emphasis is on giving a speech that combines humour with pathos, dramatic elements with more conversational moments, serious commentary with light-hearted asides, quotations drawn from a variety of sources, but all around a common thread based on the chosen topic, and showing the style of the candidate. Accordingly, the style of speech is very different from many other public speaking competitions in which candidates research and prepare speeches of their own in advance, often on questions of current affairs or public policy. With only fifteen minutes to prepare and without the aid of books or references, the content of the speech will test the candidates' general knowledge and ingenuity.\n\nEach school is represented by one speaker. Saint Ignatius’ College has the most distinguished history, with twenty-two winning candidates in the competition's history. In recent years, Sydney Grammar, Newington College and Barker College have been the most successful schools. Waverley College and The Armidale School have never fielded a winning candidate.\n\nBecause of the emphasis on oratory, the topics usually admit of wide latitude for the candidates to be creative. Often, quotations from literature, public figures, and popular culture are chosen as topics, along with proverbs or even single words. Past topics include:\n\nThe Lawrence Campbell oratory competition has many distinguished previous winners, particularly in the areas of law, politics, and the arts. Famous past winners include:\n\n\nThe only people to have won the competition on two occasions are:\n\n\nThere have been many controversies in the history of the competition. These usually arise out of allegations of plagiarism and the use of prepared material in the speech.\n\nOften, the candidate is given the benefit of any doubt, if only because candidates train intensively for the competition and must necessarily think of themes, quotations, and one-liners that may emerge in the speech the candidate later gives at the competition. However, the wholesale repetition of prepared material is strongly discouraged, and with enough proof, a winner may be stripped of the title if wholesale preparation is shown.\n\n"}

Among hackers, the word \"luser\" takes on a broad meaning, referring to any normal user (in other words, not a \"guru\"), with the implication the person is also a loser. The term is partially interchangeable with the hacker term \"lamer\". \n\nIt can also signify a layman with only user account privileges, as opposed to a power user or administrator, who has knowledge of, and access to, superuser accounts; for example, an end luser who cannot be trusted with a root account for system administration. This term is popular with technical support staff who have to deal with lusers as part of their job, often metaphorically employing a LART (Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool, also known as a clue-by-four, cluestick, or cluebat), meaning turning off the user's access to computer resources and the like.\n\nThe Jargon File states that the word was coined around 1975 at MIT. Under ITS, when a user first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed control-Z to get the computer's attention, it printed out some status information, including how many people were already using the computer. A patch to the system was then written to print \"14 losers\" instead of \"14 users\", as a joke. For a while, several hackers who disagreed on the appropriateness of the change struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the backs of the others; any time a user logged into the computer it was equally probable that a user would see, say, \"users\" or \"losers\". Finally, someone tried the compromise \"lusers\", and it stuck. Later, ITS also had the command \"luser\", which attempted to summon assistance from a list of designated helpers.\n\nAlthough ITS ceased to be used in the mid-1990s, use of the term continued to spread, partly because in Unix-style computer operating systems, \"user\" designates all unprivileged accounts, while the superuser, or root, is the special user account used for system administration. \"root\" is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions (to all files and programs) in all modes (single- or multi-user). The usage lives on, however, and the term \"luser\" is often seen in program comments and on Usenet.\n\nOn IRC, /lusers (which abbreviates \"list users\") is a common command to get the number of users connected to a server or network. On Windows operating systems, lusrmgr.msc is the MMC snap-in used to manage local users.\n\n\n"}

It is essential to look to the history of this development in order to appreciate the Maltese dialect spoken in Australia.\n\nAs a sailor nation, the Maltese began to travel many centuries ago. Many Maltese found work in the navy of the Order of St. John. Pre-dating this, the Maltese people were known as good sailors in the Mediterranean region. However, modern forms of transportation and sudden economic changes prompted mass emigration from Malta.\n\nIn 1882 Australia welcomed the first official group of immigrants from Malta, 8 immigrants sent there as part of an experiment conducted by the Maltese Imperial Government. 40 years after that first emigration to Australia, emigration began on a larger scale. Between 1911 and 1939 6,000 Maltese people emigrated to Australia and in the ten years between 1940 and 1949 numbers rose to 8,000. In the twenty years after 1949 Australia welcomed over 61,000 emigrants. 1956 saw 10,300 emigrants from Malta enter Australia. Later numbers of emigrants decreased until, in the early 1970s, the Australian authorities closed the doors for all European emigrants.\n\nThe first trace of a change in the Maltese language in Australia was evidenced in 1929 with the publication of Charles Parnis's books, the first Maltese journalist in Australia. These writings included various expressions and vocabulary not included in standard Maltese. This documentation of an Australian-Maltese dialect in journals suggest that its origins go back before 1929.\n\nAfter these first publications in Maltese by Charles Parnis and some other writers who wrote from 1929 to 1935, there was a pause in work published by Australian-Maltese authors, due to the Second World War. Publication of Australian-Maltese works resumed (in the Maltese language) after 1949, in Melbourne.\n\nThe Maltese language in Australia developed a different style from the Standard Maltese, in part due to the Australian social environment.\n\nMaltralian divergences from standard Maltese include:\n\n\n"}

This sociolect of Vernacular Brazilian Portuguese brings possible simplifications in the grammatical structures, since the vehicles in which \"miguxês\" is used are nearly universally colloquial, often space-delimited (such as SMS messages, instant messengers or social networks). It also tends to have \"simpler\" orthography in comparison to standard Portuguese orthography, which leads to the most strong criticism to it (\"miguxês\" without its common alternative spellings is associated with the just normal Internet and/or youth slang).\n\nThere are identitarian and orthographic differences between the so-called leetspeak, \"miguxês\", \"tiopês\" and \"internetês\" — Brazilian Portuguese for netspeak, which is by far the one that most closely resembles standard Portuguese —, all common sociolects found in the Portuguese-speaking digital network community, the three latter ones created in it.\n\nBasically, the use of each category depends on the individual choice and the environment in which people are interacting. While in the Internet, in a general manner, there is a handful of a different phenomenon in which users communicate with abbreviations to simplify writing, \"miguxês\" carries with it an effective intention, that is, to express an infantile language in a conversation between friends, or even satirize this style of communication. In certain subcultures in Brazil, especially in the case of what is called 'emo' there, \"miguxês\" is an item of group identification. So it would not be unusual for someone which opposes such subcultures to also develop a distaste for \"miguxês\". Brazilian 'anti-emo' groups usually satirize 'emo' teenagers with use of \"miguxês\".\n\nTogether with the cited urban tribes, they started to fell out of the mainstream in the early 2010s, so that they have much lower popularity with the following teen generation that did not see its spreading as a frequent Internet meme.\n\nAlthough orthography rules of \"miguxês\" may vary individually, and also in each region and in different urban tribes since it is plain broken Portuguese, there are certain characteristics often commonly found as:\n\n\nBrazilian indie and scene kids use a related Internet sociolect, the \"tiopês\" (from \"tiop\", which is a corruption of Portuguese \"tipo\", or equivalent to English \"like, totally\", in \"tiopês\"), which mainly uses ingroup memes as well purposeful ridiculous-sounding misspellings to add humor or irony to the message and bring group identification, much like teh of English-derived leetspeak. As it is common for the \"miguxês\", there are detractors of \"tiopês\", although much less numbered and for different reasons (usually, people which are detractors at the same time of different youth subcultures deemed as alienated, including 'emo' teenagers, scene kids and indie kids). \"Tiopês\" is also much less common in the Portuguese-speaking Internet community, and is said to be a phenomenon limited to Brazil.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "585571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=585571", "title": "Minimalist program", "text": "Minimalist program\n\nIn linguistics, the minimalist program (MP) is a major line of inquiry that has been developing inside generative grammar since the early 1990s, starting with a 1993 paper by Noam Chomsky.\n\nChomsky presents MP as a program, not as a theory, following Imre Lakatos's distinction. The MP seeks to be a mode of inquiry characterized by the flexibility of the multiple directions that its minimalism enables. Ultimately, the MP provides a conceptual framework used to guide the development of linguistic theory. In minimalism, Chomsky attempts to approach universal grammar from below—that is, proposing the question \"what would be the optimal answer to what the theory of i-Language should be?\"\n\nFor Chomsky, there are minimalist questions, but the answers can be framed in any theory. Of all these questions, the two that play the most crucial role are: \n\nThe MP appeals to the idea that the language ability in humans shows signs of being incorporated under an optimal design with exquisite organization, which seems to suggest that the inner workings conform to a very simple computational law or a particular mental organ. In other words, the MP works on the assumption that universal grammar constitutes a perfect design in the sense that it contains only what is necessary to meet humans' conceptual and physical (phonological) needs.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, and in the context of generative grammar, the MP draws on the minimalist approach of the principles and parameters program, considered to be the ultimate standard theoretical model that generative linguistics has developed since the 1980s. What this approach suggests is the existence of a fixed set of principles valid for all languages, which, when combined with settings for a finite set of binary switches (parameters), may describe the specific properties that characterize the language system a child eventually comes to attain.\n\nThe MP aims to get to know how much of the principles and parameters model can be taken as a result of this hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty. In turn, more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach provide technical principles from which the MP can be seen to follow.\n\nThe MP aims at the further development of ideas involving \"economy of derivation\" and \"economy of representation\", which had started to become significant in the early 1990s, but were still peripheral aspects of transformational grammar.\n\nThe exploration of minimalist questions has led to several radical changes in the technical apparatus of transformational generative grammatical theory. Some of the most important are:\n\nA major development of MP inquiry is bare phrase structure (BPS), a theory of phrase structure (sentence building prior to movement) developed by Noam Chomsky. The introduction of BPS has moved the Chomskyan tradition toward the dependency grammar tradition, which operates with significantly less structure than most phrase structure grammars.\n\nThis theory contrasts with X-bar theory, which preceded it, in four important ways:\n\n\nBPS incorporates two basic operations: \"merge\" and \"move\". Although there is active debate on exactly how \"move\" should be formulated, the differences between the current proposals are relatively minute. The following description follows Chomsky's original proposal.\n\nMerge is a function that takes two objects (say α and β) and merges them into an unordered set with a label (either α or β, in this case α). The label identifies the properties of the phrase.\n\nFor example, \"merge\" can operate on the lexical items \"drink\" and \"water\" to give \"drink water\". Note that the phrase \"drink water\" behaves more like the verb \"drink\" than like the noun \"water\". That is, wherever the verb \"drink\" can be put, so too can the phrase \"drink water\":\n\nI like to _____________ (drink)/(drink water).<br>\n(Drinking/Drinking water) __________ is fun.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase \"drink water\" can not typically be put in the same places as the noun \"water\":\n\nIt can be said, \"There's some \"water\" on the table\", but not \"There's some \"drink water\" on the table\".\n\nSo, the phrase is identified with a label. In the case of \"drink water\", the label is \"drink\" since the phrase acts as a verb. For simplicity, this phrase is called a verb phrase (VP). If \"cold\" and \"water\" were merged to get \"cold water\", this would be a noun phrase (NP) with the label \"water\"; it follows that the phrase \"cold water\" can appear in the same environments as the noun \"water\" in the three test sentences above. So, for \"drink water\", there is the following:\n\nThis can be represented in a typical syntax tree as follows:\n\nor, with more technical terms, as:\n\nMerge can also operate on structures already built. If it could not, then such a system would predict only two-word utterances to be grammatical. If a new head is merged with a previously formed object (a phrase), the function has the form\n\nMerge codice_1\n\nHere, γ is the label, so that γ \"projects\" from the label of the head. This corresponds to the following tree structure:\n\nMerge operates blindly, projecting labels in all possible combinations. The subcategorization features of the head then license certain label projections and eliminate all derivations with alternate projections.\n\nA \"phase\" is a syntactic domain first hypothesized by Noam Chomsky in 1998. A simple sentence is often decomposed into two phases, CP and \"v\"P (see X-bar theory). Movement of a constituent out of a phase is (in the general case) only permitted if the constituent has first moved to the left edge of the phase. This condition is described in the \"phase impenetrability condition\", which has been variously formulated within the literature. In its original conception, only the \"v\"P in transitive and unergative verbs constitute phases. The \"v\"P in passives and unaccusative verbs (if even present) are not phases. This topic is, however, currently under debate in the literature.\n\nIn the late 1990s, David E. Johnson and Shalom Lappin published the first detailed critiques of Chomsky's minimalist program. This technical work was followed by a lively debate with proponents of minimalism on the scientific status of the program. The original article provoked several replies and two further rounds of replies and counter-replies in subsequent issues of the same journal.\n\nLappin et al. argue that the minimalist program is a radical departure from earlier Chomskyan linguistic practice that is not motivated by any new empirical discoveries, but rather by a general appeal to \"perfection\", which is both empirically unmotivated and so vague as to be unfalsifiable. They compare the adoption of this paradigm by linguistic researchers to other historical paradigm shifts in natural sciences and conclude that of the minimalist program has been an \"unscientific revolution\", driven primarily by Chomsky's authority in linguistics. The several replies to the article in \"Natural Language and Linguistic Theory\" Volume 18 number 4 (2000) make a number of different defenses of the minimalist program. Some claim that it is not in fact revolutionary or not in fact widely adopted, while others agree with Lappin and Johnson on these points, but defend the vagueness of its formulation as not problematic in light of its status as a research program rather than a theory (see above).\n\n\nMuch research has been devoted to the study of the consequences that arise when minimalist questions are formulated. This list is not exhaustive.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4330353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4330353", "title": "Northwest Germanic", "text": "Northwest Germanic\n\nNorthwest Germanic is a proposed grouping of the Germanic languages, representing the current consensus among Germanic historical linguists. It does not challenge the late 19th-century tri-partite division of the Germanic dialects into North Germanic, West Germanic and East Germanic, but proposes additionally that North and West Germanic (i.e. all surviving Germanic languages today) remained as a subgroup after the southward migration of the East Germanic tribes, only splitting into North and West Germanic later. Whether this subgroup constituted a unified proto-language, or simply represents a group of dialects that remained in contact and close geographical proximity, is a matter of debate, but the formulation of Ringe and Taylor probably enjoys widespread support:\n\nThere is some evidence that North and West Germanic developed as a single\nlanguage, Proto-Northwest Germanic, after East Germanic had begun to\ndiverge. However, changes unproblematically datable to the PNWGmc period\nare few, suggesting that that period of linguistic unity did not last long. On the\nother hand, there are some indications that North and West Germanic\nremained in contact, exchanging and thus partly sharing further innovations,\nafter they had begun to diverge, and perhaps even after West Germanic had\nitself begun to diversify.\n\nThis grouping was proposed by Hans Kuhn as an alternative to the older view of a Gotho-Nordic versus West Germanic division. This older view is represented by mid 20th-century proposals to assume the existence by 250 BC of five general groups to be distinguishable: North Germanic in Southern Scandinavia excluding Jutland; North Sea Germanic along the middle Rhine and Jutland; Rhine-Weser Germanic; Elbe Germanic; and East Germanic. The Northwest Germanic theory challenges these proposals, since it is strongly tied to runic inscriptions dated from AD 200 onwards.\nMost scholars agree that East Germanic broke up from the rest of the languages in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC. The Runic Inscriptions (being written from the 2nd century) may mean that the north and West broke up in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The Migration Period started around the 4th and 5th centuries; an event which probably help diversify the Northwest Germanic (maybe even the West Germanic) languages even more.\nThe date by which such a grouping must have dissolved—in that innovations ceased to be shared—is also contentious, though it seems unlikely to have persisted after 500 AD, by which time the Anglo-Saxons had migrated to England and the Elbe Germanic tribes had settled in Southern Germany.\n\nThe evidence for Northwest Germanic is constituted by a range of common linguistic innovations in phonology, morphology, word formation and lexis in North and West Germanic, though in fact there is considerable debate about which innovations are significant. An additional problem is that Gothic, which provides almost the sole evidence of the East Germanic dialects, is attested much earlier than the other Germanic languages, with the exception of a few runic inscriptions. This means that direct comparisons between Gothic and the other Germanic languages are not necessarily good evidence for subgroupings, since the distance in time must also be taken into account.\n\nAmong the common innovations cited as evidence for Northwest Germanic are:\n\nPostulated common innovations in North Germanic and Gothic, which therefore challenge the Northwest Germanic hypothesis, include:\n\nA minority opinion is able to harmonize these two hypotheses by denying the genetic reality of both Northwest Germanic and Gotho-Nordic, seeing them rather as mere cover terms indicating close areal contacts. (Such areal contacts would have been quite strong among the early Germanic languages, given their close geographic position over a long period of time.) Under such an assumption, an early close relationship between Nordic and Gothic dialects does not exclude a later similar relationship between remaining North and West Germanic groups, once the Gothic migration had started in the 2nd or 3rd century.\n\nThere are also common innovations in Old High German and Gothic, which would appear to challenge both the Northwest Germanic and the Gotho-Nordic groupings. However, these are standardly taken to be the result of late areal contacts, based the cultural contacts across the Alps in the 5th and 6th centuries, reflected in the Christian loanwords from Gothic into Old High German.\n\n\n"}

The logical object may be a thing, person, relation, event, situation, or a string of these at any conceivable level of complexity. A relatively simple example is the conventional — successful, appropriate, and mundanely “true” — linking of a proper name to the person of whom it is a conventional designation.\n\nThere are three parts to this process when it succeeds. There is the abstract symbol which is used to represent something else (the name or the entire signifying predication, for instance); there is the something else that is represented by that symbol (whatever is signified); and there is the act of using the symbol in a conventional way to represent whatever it usually represents (the act of signifying). Pragmatic mapping is the process by which any material argument, or any imagined one, comes to be associated with a predicate that purports to be and succeeds in being about it. That is the predicate must be appropriate (\"true\" in the most mundane sense relative) to its logical object. The predication may be as simple as a naming act or as complex as a representation consisting of many distinct propositions with many associated clauses.\n\nFor instance, if we say \"Jesse James was an American outlaw\" the name \"Jesse James\" purports to be about a certain historical person whom we may know to have been shot by another individual named Robert Ford. We may know that a movie featuring Brad Pitt as Jesse James was released in September 2007 in select theaters across America. If the pragmatic mapping of the name \"Jesse James\" is complete, i.e., if it succeeds, it is mapped onto that certain individual that was actually shot by Robert Ford.\n\nNothing of importance changes in the pragmatic mapping process if it turns out that Jesse James and Robert Ford are figments of someone’s imagination, excepting, of course, the truth value of the propositions that include the logical object of the name, Jesse James. In ordinary conversation and human communication in general, it has been demonstrated logically and mathematically that meaning is utterly dependent on the true and appropriate pragmatic mapping of symbols to their conventional logical objects. Infants depend on exemplification of such mapping relations to acquire languages and all meaningful linguistic representations have been proved to depend on such mappings.\n\n\n"}

It is the visual effect of the relationships of the various objects and spaces that make up a structure to one another and to the whole. These relationships are often governed by multiples of a standard unit of length known as a \"module\".\n\nProportion in architecture was discussed by Vitruvius, Alberti, Andrea Palladio and Le Corbusier among others.\n\nArchitecture in Roman antiquity was rarely documented except in the writings of Vitruvius' treatise \"De Architectura\". Vitruvius served as an engineer under Julius Caesar during the first Gallic Wars (58-50 BC). The treatise was dedicated to Emperor Augustus. As Vitruvius defined the concept in the first chapters of the treatise, he mentioned the three prerequisites of architecture are firmness (\"firmitas\"), commodity (\"utilitas\"), and delight (\"vernustas\"), which require the architects to be equipped with a varied kind of learning and knowledge of many branches. Moreover, Vitruvius identified the \"Six Principles of Design\" as order (\"ordinatio\"), arrangement (\"dispositio\"), proportion (\"eurythmia\"), symmetry (\"symmetria\"), propriety (\"decor\") and economy (\"distributio\"). Among the six principles, proportion interrelates and supports all the other factors in geometrical forms and arithmetical ratios.\n\nThe word \"symmetria\", usually translated to \"symmetry\" in modern renderings, in ancient times meant something more closely related to \"mathematical harmony\" and measurable proportions. Vitruvius tried to describe his theory in the makeup of the human body, which he referred to as the perfect or golden ratio. The principles of measurement units digit, foot, and cubit also came from the dimensions of a Vitruvian Man. More specifically, Vitruvius used the total height of 6 feet of a person, and each part of the body takes up a different ratio. For example, the face is about 1/10 of the total height, and the head is about 1/8 of the total height. Vitruvius used these ratios to prove that the composition of classical orders mimicked the human body, thereby ensuring aesthetic harmonization when people viewed architectural columns.\n\nIn classical architecture, the module was established as the radius of the lower shaft of a classical column, with proportions expressed as a fraction or multiple of that module.\n\nIn his \"Le Modulor\" (1948), Le Corbusier presented a system of proportions which took the golden ratio and a man with a raised arm as the scalable modules of proportion. \n\n\n"}

Joshi describing it as a \"singularly unfortunate coinage\" and noting that the correct analogy to telekinesis would \"not be “pyrokinesis” but “telepyrosis” (fire from a distance)\". King is the first person to give the idea a name as neither the term pyrokinesis nor any other term describing the idea have been found in prior works. Parapsychologists describe pyrokinesis as the ability to excite the atoms within an object until they generate enough energy to burst into flame. Science fiction works define pyrokinesis as speeding up the movement of molecules in order to increase temperature.\n\nA. W. Underwood, a 19th-century African-American, achieved minor celebrity status with the purported ability to set items ablaze. Magicians and scientists have suggested concealed pieces of phosphorus may have instead been responsible. The phosphorus could be readily ignited by breath or rubbing. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that Underwood may have used a \"chemical-combustion technique, and still other means. Whatever the exact method — and the phosphorus trick might be the most likely — the possibilities of deception far outweigh any occult powers hinted at by Charles Fort or others.\"\n\nThe medium Daniel Dunglas Home was known for performing fire feats and handling a heated lump of coal taken from a fire. The magician Henry R. Evans wrote that the coal handling was a juggling trick, performed by Home using a hidden piece of platinum. Hereward Carrington described Evans hypothesis as \"certainly ingenious\" but pointed out William Crookes, an experienced chemist, was present at a séance whilst Home performed the feat and would have known how to distinguish the difference between coal and platinum. Frank Podmore wrote that most of the fire feats could have easily be performed by conjuring tricks and sleight of hand but hallucination and sense-deception may have explained Crookes' claim about observing flames from Home's fingers.\n\nJoseph McCabe has written that Home's alleged feats of pyrokinesis were weak and unsatisfactory, he noted that they were performed in dark conditions amongst unreliable witnesses. McCabe suggested the coal handling was probably a \"piece of asbestos from Home's pocket\".\n\nIn March 2011, a three-year-old girl in Antique Province, Philippines gained media attention for the supposed supernatural power to predict or create fires. The town mayor said he witnessed a pillow ignite after the girl said \"fire... pillow.\" Others claimed to have witnessed the girl either predicting or causing fire without any physical contact with the objects.\n\nSometimes claims of pyrokinesis are published in the context of fire ghosts, such as Canneto di Caronia fires and earlier Italian case of young nanny, Carole Compton.\n\nThere is no scientifically plausible method for the brain to trigger explosions or fires.\n\n\n"}

This described the practice of signatories to petitions against authority (usually Government officials petitioning the Crown) appending their names on a document in a non-hierarchical circle or ribbon pattern (and so disguising the order in which they have signed) so that none may be identified as a ringleader.\n\nThis practice was adopted by sailors petitioning officers in the Royal Navy (first recorded 1731).\n\nA round robin letter was authored in Cuba after the cessation of hostilities in 1898 by a committee of 10 brigade commanders of the American Army's V Corps including acting brigade commander Theodore Roosevelt during the Spanish–American War, to accelerate the departure of the American Army back to the United States during the rainy disease-plagued summer season.

Semantic overload is related to the linguistic concept of polysemy. Overloading is related to the psychological concept of information overload, and the computer science concept of an overloaded expression. A term that is semantically overloaded is a kind of \"overloaded expression\" in language that causes a certain small degree of \"information overload\" in the receiving audience.\n\nAn example of this is the Basque word \"herri\" which can be translated as \"nation; country, land; people, population\"; and \"town, village, settlement\", amongst other things leading to difficulties in translating the indigenous term Euskal Herria. Another example is the term \"memory\", especially as used in scholarship.\n\nExpletives are also notable for this quality, and conversely this quality is also a contributor to why such terms may be regarded as crude or inappropriate.\n\nMeanings associated with a semantically overloaded word have different qualities: those the word itself refers directly to, and other meanings inferred from its use in context.\n\nMinority languages that spread into new domains frequently suffer from semantic overloading by attempting to adapt existing terms to cover new concepts. One such example from Scottish Gaelic is the over-use of the word \"comhairle\" (originally \"advice, counsel\") for concepts such as \"committee\", \"council\", and \"consultation\" as exemplified by Donald MacAulay in \"dh'iarr a' chomhairle comhairle air a’ chomhairle chomhairleachaidh\": \"The committee sought advice from the consultative council\"—a sentence that is opaque in meaning.\n"}

During this period he founded Lisbon's Centro Nacionalista Hindu (in 1926) and the periodical \"Índia Nova\" (alongside Adeodato Barreto and other émigré Goan intellectuals). Through the 1930s and 1940s, Mascerenhas worked in the Portuguese judicial system, first in the Algarve and then in the Alentejo.\n\nAfter India's independence from Britain in 1948, Mascerenhas returned to the Subcontinent and actively participated in Goa Liberation Movement. Although he spent some time in Goa, he was forced into exile and spent the years 1950-58 in Bombay. During his years of exile in Bombay, he published clandestinely \"Ressurge Goa\", a political newspaper from 1950 to 1959. Returning to Goa in 1959, he was arrested, and the Portuguese rulers deported him to Portugal where he was jailed, first in Aljube and then in Caxias. Some years after the liberation of Goa he was released by the Government of Portugal in 1970 in exchange for the release of the Goan Padre Francisco 'Chico' Monteiro, who had been placed under house arrest by the Indian authorities for refusing to give up his Portuguese nationality.\n\nOn his return to Goa from Portugal in 1970, he founded the Círculo de Amizade Indo-Portuguesa (the Indo-Portuguese Friendship Society) and restarted \"Ressurge Goa\" as a cultural and political paper.\n\nMascerenhas was a prolific poet in Portuguese and also did a Portuguese translation of the autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi and of many novels by Tagore.\n\nMascerenhas published two volumes of poetry: \"Poemas de Desespero e Concolação\" (Poems of Despair and Consolation, 1971) and \"Ciclo Goês\" (Goan Cycle, 1973).\n\n\nMascarenhas published an English-language autobiography, \"When the Mango-Trees Blossomed\", in 1975.

The novel, \"Jogos Malabares\" (Malarbar Games), which he had to hide from the prison authorities, appears to have been lost. The novella was his \"Sinfonia Goesa\", written in 1962 while Mascerenhas was imprisoned in Aljube gaol.

Though mostly unknown to later American writers, his short story \"Le Mulâtre\" (\"The Mulatto\") is the earliest known work of fiction by a Creole author.\n\nOn 2 June 1817 Juan Victor Séjour was born in New Orleans to François Marcou, a free mulatto father from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), and Eloisa Philippe Ferrand, a New Orleans quadroon. His parents were wealthy, and had him educated in a private school. At the age of nineteen he moved to Paris to continue his education and find work. There he met members of the Parisian literary elite, including Cyrille Bissette, publisher of the black-owned journal \"La Revue des Colonies\". Bisette published \"Le Mulâtre\", Séjour's first work, in 1837. The story of a loyal slave exacting revenge on his cruel master/father for the death of his wife, \"Le Mulâtre\" contains an indictment of New World slavery that is found in none of Séjour's subsequent work.\n\nSéjour then turned away from written fiction, and composed an ode to Napoleon in 1841 and the verse drama \"The Jew of Seville\" in 1844. The latter cemented his reputation as a playwright; he went on to write \"Richard III\", a Shakespeare-inspired costume drama about Richard III of England, that became Séjour's most acclaimed work. Towards the end of his life, however, Séjour's plays fell out of favor, resulting in a decline in his status.\n\nWritten in French, \"Le Mulâtre\" had little effect on American literature, and was not even translated into English until the late 20th century. Its condemnation of slavery, however, anticipates the work of later African-American writers such as Frederick Douglass and William Wells Brown.\n\nSéjour tended to leave racism discussions out of his plays, as exemplified by his play \"The Brown Overcoat\". It was a typical artificial comedy of the time period with witty comments and puns; however, it has nothing to do with race or greater issues of the world. This being so, Séjour is still known as a great African-American playwright who led a successful career.\n\n\n\n"}

The dialects of Loya Paktia like Zadrani are also very closely related, except that they are of the harsh northern variety.\n\nWaziristani differs significantly in pronunciation and grammar from the standard literary Pashto based on the larger Kandahar, Kabul and Yousafzai dialects. The vowels [a], [ɑ], [u] and [o] of standard Pashto yield [ɑ], [o], [i] and [e] respectively, so [paʂto] becomes [pɑɕte] in Waziristani. A special feature of Waziristani is that the phonemes [ʃ] and [ʂ], along with their voiced counterparts, [ʒ] and [ʐ], have merged into the phonemes [ɕ] and [ʑ], both of which also exist in the nearby Ormuri language of Kaniguram, South Waziristan. The Pashto alphabet has no symbol for their expression and the regular symbols of ژ and ش may be used.\n\nThe standard Pashto word for \"boy\", \"هلک\" [halək], is rarely heard in Waziristani, instead, \"وېړکی\" [weɻkai] meaning \"little one\" is used. The word \"ləshki\" [ləɕki] is used instead of the standard \"لږ\" [ləʐ], \"a little bit\". The pronoun موږ ([muʐ] or [mung]), meaning \"we\", is pronounced [miʑ] in Waziristani.\n\nWaziristani, like many other obscure Pashto dialects, is almost never written and its speakers may use standard Pashto as a literary language. Waziristani Pashto is spoken by various tribes, and it is also called \"Maseedwola\" by the Mahsuds and \"Dawarwola\" by the Dawari. There are slight differences in pronunciation, for example, the phonemes [t͡s] and [d͡z] can become [s] and [z], or even [t͡ʃ] and [d͡ʒ], depending on the tribe or area the speaker is from.\n\n\n"}

Her mother was a singer and concubine called Maknūna (herself the \"jāriya\" of one al-Marwānīya). It appears that, with her father dying early in her life, ‘Ulayya was brought up by her half-brother Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-809).\n\n‘Ulayya was a princess, and, like her half-brother Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi (779–839), a noted musician, and poet. It has been claimed that she surpassed her brother in skills and while 'not the only princess known to have composed poetry and songs', nonetheless 'the most gifted'. 'Much of her poetry consists of short pieces designed to be sung; in the \"muḥdath\" style, it treats of love, friendship and longing for home, but also includes praise of Hārūn, the caliph, celebration of wine and sharp attacks on enemies.'\n\nThe main source for ‘Ulayya's life is the tenth-century \"Kitāb al-Aghānī\" of Abū ’l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī. This and other sources tend to portray ‘Ulayya as an accomplished woman who could readily hold her own in court society, but who tended to shy from too prominent a role in public life. She was wealthy and clearly possessed slave-girls, and had an intimate relationship with her powerful brothers; although there is little evidence of her communing with religious scholars, 'various reports in ‘Ulayya's \"tarājim\" refer to her piety and adherence to ritual obligations'.\n\n‘Ulayya was married to an ‘Abbāsid prince, but 'love-poems of her addressed to two slaves have been preserved'. One of the best known anecdotes about her concerns\n\nher relationship with a member of al-Rashīd's palace staff, a \"khādim\" named Ṭall, with whom she would correspond in verse. When al-Rashīd forbids her from uttering his name, she follows his order to the letter even when it precludes her from uttering a line of \"Sūrat al-Baqara\" in which the term \"ṭall\" occurs. When the caliph learns of this, he is swayed and presents Ṭall to her as a gift. In this case, her piety become the means to winning a quite worldly reward.\n\nAs example of ‘Ulayya's poetry is:\n\n"}
