{"id": "1834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834", "title": "Allophone", "text": "Allophone\n\nIn phonology, an allophone (; from the Greek , \"állos\", \"other\" and , \"phōnē\", \"voice, sound\") is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds, or \"phones\", or signs used to pronounce a single phoneme in a particular language. For example, (as in \"stop\" ) and (as in \"Letter \") are allophones for the phoneme in English, while these two are considered to be different phonemes in Spanish. On the other hand (as in \"dolor\" ) and (as in \"nada\" ) are allophones for the phoneme in Spanish, while these two are considered to be different phonemes in English.\n\nThe specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context, with such allophones being called positional variants, but some allophones occur in free variation. Replacing a sound by another allophone of the same phoneme usually does not change the meaning of a word, but the result may sound non-native or even unintelligible.\n\nNative speakers of a given language perceive one phoneme in the language as a single distinctive sound and are \"both unaware of and even shocked by\" the allophone variations that are used to pronounce single phonemes.\n\nThe term \"allophone\" was coined by Benjamin Lee Whorf in the 1940s. In doing so, he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by George L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition.\n\nWhenever a user's speech is vocalized for a given phoneme, it is slightly different from other utterances, even for the same speaker. That has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are (see phoneme for details). Only some of the variation is significant, by being detectable or perceivable, to speakers.\n\nThere are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has the unconscious freedom to choose the allophone that is used.\n\nIf a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context, and using a different allophone for a phoneme would cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native, the allophones are said to be \"complementary\". The allophones then complement each other, and one of them is not used in a situation in which the usage of another is standard. For complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a phonological process.\n\nIn other cases, the speaker can freely select from \"free variant\" allophones on personal habit or preference.\n\nAnother example of an allophone is assimilation, in which a phoneme is to sound more like another phoneme. One example of assimilation is consonant voicing and devoicing, in which voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants, and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.\n\nAn allotone is a tonic allophone, such as the neutral tone in Standard Mandarin.\n\nThere are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.\n\n\nBecause the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme : unreleased as in \"cat\", aspirated as in \"top\", glottalized as in \"button\", flapped as in American English \"water\", nasalized flapped as in \"winter\", and none of the above as in \"stop\". However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n\nA flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated \"nitrate\" than for the unaspirated \"night rate.\" The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a Mandarin-speaker, for whom and are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.\n\nAllophones of English may be noticed if the 'light' of \"leaf\" is contrasted with the 'dark' of \"feel\" . Again, the difference is much more obvious to a Turkish-speaker, for whom and are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\nThere are many examples for allophones in languages other than English. Typically, languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation: examples are Hawaiian and Toki Pona. Here are some examples (the links of language names go to the specific article or subsection on the phenomenon):\n\nSince phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct phonetic transcription. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple broad transcription is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.\n\nHowever, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the \"elsewhere condition\" to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The \"elsewhere\" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.\n\nFor example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the \"elsewhere\" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.\n\nIn other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.\n\nAn alternative, which is commonly used for archiphonemes, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [ŋ].\n\nIn rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as dingbats, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6800164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6800164", "title": "Barranquenho", "text": "Barranquenho\n\nBarranquenho (\"Barranquenhu\"; English: Barranquian) is a Romance linguistic variety spoken in the Portuguese town of Barrancos, near the Spanish border. It is a mixed language, and can be considered either a variety of Portuguese (Alentejan Portuguese) heavily influenced by the Spanish dialects of neighbouring areas in Spain in Extremadura and Andalusia (especially those from Encinasola and Rosal de la Frontera), or a Spanish dialect (Extremaduran / Andalusian) heavily influenced by Portuguese.\n\nBarranquian speakers say that they speak neither Spanish nor Portuguese but a third language altogether different. Although unlike some sources may state, Barranquenho is very easy to understand by speakers of both Portuguese and Spanish, as it is very close to both, and especially similar to the Andalusian dialect. Ethnologue lists Barranquian as a dialect of Extremaduran, perhaps because Barrancos was populated by settlers from Badajoz, a city in Extremadura, though not in a Extremaduran language speaking area.\n\nThe development of Barranquenho seems to be relatively recent (in the past 200 years), unlike other minority linguistic varieties in the Iberian Peninsula which have medieval roots.\n\nThe Portuguese base of this dialect is extremely hidden behind the Spanish dialects that mold it. The most characteristic aspect of this dialect is the aspiration of the 's' and 'z' in the end of the words, like in the Extremaduran and Andalusian dialects: 'cruh' (Portuguese/Spanish: cruz; English: cross), 'buhcá' (Portuguese/Spanish: buscar; English: search) ... \nSometimes the letters can be completely muted: 'uma bê' (Portuguese: uma vez; English: once).\nThe Portuguese 'j', 'ge' and 'gi' are pronounced like the Spanish [x].\n\nThe 'l' and 'r' in the end of the words are not pronounced: 'Manué' (Manuel), 'olivá' (olivar). But they appear again in the plural form: 'olivareh' (olivares). If the 'l' is at the end of a syllable it turns into 'r': 'argo' (algo). Like in Spanish, there is no differentiation between 'b' and 'v': vaca ['baka']. Just like in Extremaduran (or Brazilian Portuguese), the '-e' (English 'eh') in the end is pronounced like '-i' (English 'ee'): 'pobri' (pobre).\n\nThe Portuguese form of the first person of the plural 'nós' is replaced by 'nusotrus' - a variation of the Spanish 'nosotros'. The placing of the pronouns is closer to the Spanish norm than to the Portuguese: 'se lavô' (Portuguese: lavou-se; Spanish: se lavó; English: has been washed).\n\nIt also contains many verbal forms of clearly Spanish conjugation: 'andubi' (Portuguese: andei, Spanish: anduve); 'supimos' (Portuguese: soubemos; Spanish: supimos).\n\nThe Portuguese government does not recognize nor protect the use of Barranquenho.\n\n"}

Those items on the list are denied access. The opposite is a whitelist, which means only items on the list are let through whatever gate is being used. A greylist contains items that are temporarily blocked (or temporarily allowed) until an additional step is performed.\n\nBlacklists can be applied at various points in a security architecture, such as a host, web proxy, DNS servers, email server, firewall, directory servers or application authentication gateways. The type of element blocked is influenced by the access control location. DNS servers may be well-suited to block domain names, for example, but not URLs. A firewall is well-suited for blocking IP addresses, but less so for blocking malicious files or passwords.\n\nExample uses include a company that might prevent a list of software from running on its network, a school that might prevent access to a list of web sites from its computers, or a business that wants to ensure their computer users are not choosing easily guessed, poor passwords.\n\nBlacklists are used to protect a variety of systems in computing. The content of the blacklist is likely needs to be targeted to the type of system defended.\n\nAn information system includes end-point hosts like user machines and servers. A blacklist in this location may include certain types of software that are not allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist peer to peer file sharing on its systems. In addition to software, people, devices and Web sites can also be blacklisted.\n\nMost email providers have a anti-spam feature that essentially blacklists certain email addresses if they are deemed unwanted. How this happens is when a successful phishing attack (from an address that is forged from reliable accounts to try to recover personal information) is executed, then the email device deems the address to be spam, and proceeds to blacklist the address.\n\nAn e-mail spam filter may keep a blacklist of email addresses, any mail from which would be prevented from reaching its intended destination. It may also use sending domain names or sending IP addresses to implement a more general block.\n\nIn addition to private email blacklists, there are lists that are kept for public use, examples are\n\n\nThe goal of a blacklist in a web browser is to prevent the user from visiting a malicious or deceitful web page via filtering locally. A common web browsing blacklist is Google's Safe Browsing, which is installed by default in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.\n\nBlacklisting can also apply to user credentials. It is common for systems or websites to blacklist certain reserved usernames that are not allowed to be chosen by the system or website's user populations. These reserved usernames are commonly associated with built-in system administration functions.\n\nPassword blacklists are very similar to username blacklists but typically contain significantly more entries than username blacklists. Password blacklists are applied to prevent users from choosing passwords that are easily guessed or are well known and could lead to unauthorized access by malicious parties. Password blacklists are deployed as an additional layer of security, usually in addition to a password policy, which sets the requirements of the password length and/or character complexity. This is because there are a significant number of password combinations that fulfill many password policies but are still easily guessed (i.e., Password123, Qwerty123).\n\nBlacklists are distributed in a variety of ways. Some use simple mailing lists. A DNSBL is a common distribution method that leverages the DNS itself. Some lists make use of rsync for high-volume exchanges of data. Web-server functions may be used; either simple GET requests may be used or more complicated interfaces such as a RESTful API.\n\n\nAs expressed in a recent conference paper focusing on blacklists of domain names and IP addresses used for Internet security, \"these lists generally do not intersect. Therefore, it appears that these lists do not converge on one set of malicious indicators.\" This concern combined with an economic model means that, while blacklists are an essential part of network defense, they need to be used in concert with whitelists and greylists.\n\nAn example would be the Adblock Plus blocklist that includes a number of features including whitelists within the blacklist by adding a prefix of two at symbols and two pipe symbols e.g. \"@@||www.blocksite.com\".\n\n"}

{"id": "741716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=741716", "title": "Cherokee syllabary", "text": "Cherokee syllabary\n\nThe Cherokee syllabary is a syllabary invented by Sequoyah to write the Cherokee language in the late 1810s and early 1820s. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy as he could not previously read any script. He first experimented with logograms, but his system later developed into a syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a syllable rather than a single phoneme; the 85 (originally 86) characters provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Although some symbols resemble Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic letters, the relationship between symbols and sounds is different.\n\nEach of the characters represents one syllable, as in the Japanese \"kana\" and the Bronze Age Greek Linear B writing systems. The first six characters represent isolated vowel syllables. Characters for combined consonant and vowel syllables then follow.\n\nThe charts below show the syllabary in recitation order, left to right, top to bottom as arranged by Samuel Worcester, along with his commonly used transliterations. He played a key role in the development of Cherokee printing from 1828 until his death in 1859.\n\nThe Latin letter 'v' in the transcriptions, seen in the last column, represents a nasal vowel, /ə̃/.\n\nThe Cherokee character Ꮩ \"do\" has a different orientation in old documents, resembling a Greek Λ (or barless A) rather than a Latin V as in modern documents.\n\nNote that the 86th character (Ᏽ, \"mv\") is obsolete. There is also a handwritten cursive form of the syllabary; notably, the handwritten glyphs bear little resemblance to the printed forms.\n\nThe phonetic values of these characters do not equate directly to those represented by the letters of the Latin script. Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others may represent multiple variations of the same syllable. Not all phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are represented. For example, while /d/ + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from /t/+vowel by use of different graphs, syllables beginning with /g/ are all conflated with those beginning with /k/, so that in most cases, /k/ is written with a glyph in the \"g\" row. Also, long vowels are not ordinarily distinguished from short vowels, tones are not marked, and there is no regular rule for representing consonant clusters. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon.\n\nSix distinctive vowel qualities are represented in the Cherokee syllabary based on where they are pronounced in the mouth, including the high vowels \"i\" and \"u\", mid vowels \"e, v\", and \"o\", and low vowel \"a\". The syllabary also does not distinguish among syllables that end in vowels, \"h,\" or glottal stop. For example, the single symbol, Ꮡ, is used to represent \"su\" in \"su:dali\", meaning \"six\" (ᏑᏓᎵ). This same symbol Ꮡ represents \"suh\" as in \"suhdi,\" meaning 'fishhook' (ᏑᏗ). Therefore, there is no differentiation among the symbols used for syllables ending in a single vowel versus that vowel plus \"h.\"\n\nWhen consonants other than \"s, h,\" or glottal stop arise with other consonants in clusters, the appropriate consonant plus a \"dummy vowel\" is used. This dummy vowel is not pronounced and is either chosen arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel). For example, ᏧᎾᏍᏗ (tsu-na-s-di) represents the word \"ju:nsdi\", meaning 'small.' \"Ns\" in this case is the consonant cluster that requires the following dummy vowel, \"a\". \"Ns\" is written as ᎾᏍ /nas/. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced in the word (\"ju:nsdi\"). (The transliterated \"ts\" represents the affricate \"j\"). Adult speakers can distinguish words by context.\n\nIf a labial consonant such as \"p\" or \"b\" appears in a borrowed word or name, it is written using the \"qu\" row. This /kw/ ~ /p/ correspondence is a known linguistic phenomenon that exists elsewhere (cf. P-Celtic, Osco-Umbrian, Telerin).\n\nSome Cherokee words pose a problem for transliteration software because they contain adjacent pairs of single letter symbols that (without special provisions) would be combined when doing the back conversion from Latin script to Cherokee. Here are a few examples:\nFor these examples, the back conversion is likely to join \"s-a\" as \"sa\" or \"s-i\" as \"si\". One solution is to use an apostrophe to separate the two, as is done in Japanese (e.g.: Man'yogana): \"itsalis'anedi\".\n\nOther Cherokee words contain character pairs that entail overlapping transliteration sequences. Examples:\nIf the Latin script is parsed from left to right, longest match first, then without special provisions, the back conversion would be wrong for the latter. There are several similar examples involving these character combinations: \"naha nahe nahi naho nahu nahv\".\n\nA further problem encountered in transliterating Cherokee is that there are some pairs of different Cherokee words that transliterate to the same word in the Latin script. Here are some examples:\nWithout special provision, a round trip conversion may change ᎠᏍᎡᏃ to ᎠᏎᏃ and change ᎨᏍᎥᎢ to ᎨᏒᎢ.\n\n\nCherokee uses Arabic numerals (0–9). Sequoyah proposed a system of numerals for Cherokee, but his system was never adopted. Sequoyah's system included symbols for 1–20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 as well as a symbol for three zeros for numbers in the thousands and a symbol for six zeros for numbers in the millions. These last two symbols representing 000 and 000,000 are made up of three separate symbols each.\n\nAround 1809, impressed by the \"talking leaves\" of European written languages, Sequoyah began work to create a writing system for the Cherokee language. After attempting to create a character for each word, Sequoyah realized this would be too difficult and eventually created characters to represent syllables. Sequoyah took some ideas from his copy of the Bible, which he studied for characters to use in print, noticing the simplicity of the Roman letters and adopting them to make the writing of his syllabary easier. He worked on the syllabary for twelve years before completion, and dropped or modified most of the characters he originally created.\n\nAfter the syllabary was completed in the early 1820s, it achieved almost instantaneous popularity and spread rapidly throughout Cherokee society. By 1825, the majority of Cherokees could read and write in their newly developed orthography.\n\nSome of Sequoyah's most learned contemporaries immediately understood that the syllabary was a great invention. For example, when Albert Gallatin, a politician and trained linguist, saw a copy of Sequoyah's syllabary, he believed it was superior to the English alphabet. He recognized that even though the Cherokee student must learn 85 characters instead of 26 for English, the Cherokee could read immediately after learning all the symbols. The Cherokee student could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing might require two years to achieve.\n\nIn 1828, the order of the characters in a chart and the shapes of the characters were modified by Cherokee author and editor Elias Boudinot to adapt the syllabary to printing presses. The 86th character was dropped entirely. Following these changes, the syllabary was adopted by the \"Cherokee Phoenix\" newspaper, later \"Cherokee Advocate\", followed by the \"Cherokee Messenger\", a bilingual paper printed in Indian Territory in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn 1834, Worcester made changes to several characters in order to improve the readability of Cherokee text. Most notably, he inverted the \"do\" character (Ꮩ) so that it could not be confused with the \"go\" character (Ꭺ). Otherwise, the characters remained remarkably invariant until the advent of new typesetting technologies in the 20th century.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Cherokee Phoenix Press began publishing literature in the Cherokee syllabary, including the \"Cherokee Singing Book\". A Cherokee syllabary typewriter ball was developed for the IBM Selectric in the late 1970s. Computer fonts greatly expanded Cherokee writers' ability to publish in Cherokee. In 2010, a Cherokee keyboard cover was developed by Roy Boney, Jr. and Joseph Erb, facilitating more rapid typing in Cherokee. The keyboard cover is now used by students in the Cherokee Nation Immersion School, where all coursework is written in syllabary.\n\nIn August 2010, the Oconaluftee Institute for Cultural Arts in Cherokee, North Carolina acquired a letterpress and had the Cherokee syllabary recast to begin printing one-of-a-kind fine art books and prints in syllabary. Artists Jeff Marley and Frank Brannon completed a collaborative project on October 19, 2013, in which they printed using Cherokee syllabary type from Southwestern Community College in the print shop at New Echota. This was the first time syllabary type has been used at New Echota since 1835.\n\nIn 2015 the Unicode Consortium encoded a lowercase version of the script, since typists would often set Cherokee with two different point sizes, so as to mark beginnings of sentences and given names (as in the Latin alphabet). Handwritten Cherokee also shows a difference in lower- and uppercase letters, such as descenders and ascenders. Lowercase Cherokee has already been encoded in the font Everson Mono.\n\nThe syllabary is finding increasingly diverse usage today, from books, newspapers, and websites to the street signs of Tahlequah, Oklahoma and Cherokee, North Carolina. An increasing corpus of children's literature is printed in Cherokee syllabary to meet the needs of Cherokee students in the Cherokee language immersion schools in Oklahoma and North Carolina.\n\nIn recent years evidence has emerged suggesting that the Cherokee syllabary provided a model for the design of the Vai syllabary in Liberia, Africa. The Vai syllabary emerged about 1832/33. The link appears to have been Cherokee who emigrated to Liberia after the invention of the Cherokee syllabary (which in its early years spread rapidly among the Cherokee) but before the invention of the Vai syllabary. One such man, Austin Curtis, married into a prominent Vai family and became an important Vai chief himself. It is perhaps not coincidence that the \"inscription on a house\" that drew the world's attention to the existence of the Vai script was in fact on the home of Curtis, a Cherokee. There also appears to be a connection between an early form of written Bassa and the earlier Cherokee syllabary.\n\nCherokee languages classes typically begin with a transliteration of Cherokee into Roman letters, only later incorporating the syllabary. The Cherokee language classes offered through Haskell Indian Nations University, Northeastern State University, the University of Oklahoma, the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, Western Carolina University, and the elementary school immersion classes offered by the Cherokee Nation and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Immersion School all teach the syllabary. The fine arts degree program at Southwestern Community College incorporates the syllabary in its printmaking classes.\n\nCherokee was added to the Unicode Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0. On June 17, 2015, with the release of version 8.0, Cherokee was redefined as a bicameral script; the character repertoire was extended to include a complete set of lowercase Cherokee letters as well as the archaic character (Ᏽ).\n\nThe first Unicode block for Cherokee is U+13A0–U+13FF. It contains all 86 uppercase letters, together with six lowercase letters:\nThe Cherokee Supplement block is U+AB70–U+ABBF. It contains the remaining 80 lowercase letters.\nA single Cherokee Unicode font, Plantagenet Cherokee, is supplied with macOS, version 10.3 (Panther) and later. Windows Vista also includes a Cherokee font. Several free Cherokee fonts are available including Digohweli, Donisiladv, and Noto Sans Cherokee.

It can also be described in a positive sense as a report from a consumer providing documentation about a problem with a product or service. In fact, some modern business consultants urge businesses to view customer complaints as a gift.\n\nConsumer complaints are usually informal complaints directly addressed to a company or public service provider, and most consumers manage to resolve problems with products and services in this way, but it sometimes requires persistence.\n\nIf the grievance is not addressed in a way that satisfies the consumer, the consumer sometimes registers the complaint with a third party such as the Better Business Bureau, a county government (if it has a \"consumer protection\" office) and Federal Trade Commission (in the United States). These and similar organizations in other countries accept for consumer complaints and assist people with customer service issues, as do government representatives like attorneys general. Consumers however rarely file complaints in the more formal legal sense, which consists of a formal legal process (see the article on complaint).\n\nIn some countries (for example Australia, the United Kingdom, and many countries of the European Community), the making of consumer complaints, particularly regarding the sale of financial services, is governed by statute (law). The statutory authority may require companies to reply to complaints within set time limits, publish written procedures for handling customer dissatisfaction, and provide information about arbitration schemes.\n\nInternet forums and the advent of social media have provided consumers with a new way to submit complaints. Consumer news and advocacy websites often accept and publish complaints. Publishing complaints on highly visible websites increases the likelihood that the general public will become aware of the consumer's complaint. If, for example, a person with many \"followers\" or \"friends\" publishes a complaint on social media, it may go \"viral\". Internet forums in general and on complaint websites have made it possible for individual consumers to hold large corporations accountable in a public forum.\n\n"}

Generally a starting player will be listed first or on top while a back-up will be listed below. Depth charts also tend to resemble the actual position locations of certain players.\n\nThe typical Major League Baseball depth chart consists of a list of players at each position, with the starter or first-string player listed first, followed by replacement and platoon players. For fantasy baseball, typical preseason projection systems such as PECOTA construct depth charts that specify not just the order of the players at each position (starter, replacement or bench player) but also the amount of playing time each person at that position will have. For example, at first base one player may be projected as playing 60 percent of the innings, and another 40 percent for the coming season, while at catcher one player may be projected as playing 80 percent of the innings, and another 20 percent. For pitchers, the depth charts project the number of innings each roster player will pitch.\n\nThe line system in ice hockey follows the same structure as a depth chart.\n\nThe term depth chart is now also being used from the perspective of management theory, to address the process of key positioning leaders within the organization, considering a dynamic life cycle perspective which includes developmental tasks such as those cited in books and articles related to the leadership pipeline subject. A depth chart analysis for key positioning leaders should affect the development of leadership training programs and high performance development initiatives in modern corporations and enterprises.\n"}

In his \"Introduction to Semantics\" (Harvard Uni.

He received the Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak in 1940 and the Narmad Suvarna Chandrak in 1957.\n\nDhansukhlal Mehta was born on October 20th, 1890 in the city of Wadhwan, which is on the Kathiawar peninsula (now in Surendranagar district, Gujarat). His family was native to Surat. After completing his schooling in Wadhwan, Palitana and Surat, he obtained a diploma from Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute, Mumbai. From 1914 to 1925, he worked at various places in Mumbai, before joining Scindia Steam Navigation Company Ltd. in 1925.\n\nHe died on August 29th, 1974.\n\nDhansukhlal Mehta wrote short stories, plays, literary criticism, book reviews, an autobiography, and humorous essays. According to Mansukhlal Jhaveri, he was a pioneer of Gujarati short stories, and one of the first writers who depicted psychological conflicts in his characters. His short stories dealt with contemporary family life. However, according to the \"Encyclopedia of Indian Literature\", he couldn't develop the short stories as an art form. He began earnestly studying humorous writers of the West and wrote humorous essays, short stories, and sketches. In 1908, his short stories appeared in \"Jnanasudha\", a magazine edited by Ramanlal Desai. Krishnalal Jhaveri wrote in \"Further Milestone in Gujarati Literature\", \"Dhansukhlal Mehta never goes far afield in search of humor, but finds it in the actual work-a-day life around him. His art can be fully enjoyed only by a man who has lived in a small town in Gujarat, and as one read his works, he almost comes to love the everyday life of modern Gujarat in spite of its shortcomings.\" \n\nHis collections of short stories include \"Hu, Sarla ane Mitramandal\" (1920) and \"Asadharan Anubhav ane Biji Vato\" (1924). In 1936, he co-wrote \"Ame Badha\" (lit. We All), a humorous autobiographical novel, with Jyotindra Dave. It was highly acclaimed and is widely regarded as one of the best humorous novels in Gujarati literature. It was the second humorous novel in Gujarati, after \"Bhadrambhadra\" by Ramanbhai Neelkanth. According to Harshavadan Trivedi, it was the first co-written Gujarati novel.\n\nIn collaboration with Gulabdas Broker, he wrote \"Dhumraser\", a dramatization of Broker's short story of the same name. His selected humorous works were edited by Vinod Bhatt and published as \"Hasya Visesha: Dhansukhlal Mehta\" in 2017.\n\nHe was awarded the Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak in 1940 for contributions to Gujarati literature.

{"id": "1779632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1779632", "title": "East Flemish", "text": "East Flemish\n\nEast Flemish (, ) is a collective term for the two easternmost subdivisions (\"true\" East Flemish, also called Core Flemish, and Waaslandic and their transitional and city dialects) of the so-called Flemish dialects, native to the southwest of the Dutch language area, which also include West Flemish. Their position between West Flemish and Brabantian has caused East Flemish dialects to be grouped with the latter as well. They are spoken mainly in the province of East Flanders and a narrow strip in the southeast of West Flanders in Belgium and eastern Zeelandic Flanders in the Netherlands. Even though the dialects of the Dender area are often discussed together with the East Flemish dialects because of their location, the latter are actually South Brabantian.\n\nBefore the occurrence of written records, the dialect continuum that took shape in the Old Dutch language area was characterised mainly by differences from east to west, with the east showing more continental Germanic traits and the west having more coastal Germanic features. In East Flanders, it can be noted that not a single typical eastern Low Franconian trait has reached the region, but coastal characteristics are fairly common, albeit less so than more to the west.\n\nIn the 15th century, the dominant position in the Low Countries shifted from the County of Flanders to the Duchy of Brabant, which brought an expansian of linguistic traits from Brabant, the so-called 'Brabantic Expansion'. As the Scheldt formed a large barrier in the north, those traits were introduced mainly from South Brabant, particularly the city of Brussels. The Dender area probably already started the process in the 14th century, but Ghent (and probably the rest of the province) resisted those changes for at least another century, as writings from Ghent still indicated a phonology that was typically West Flemish phonology in the mid-16th century. Eventually, two processes caused the spread of Brabantian traits in eastern Flanders:\n\nWhile the second process has caused a fairly wide extension of some traits, the traits spread by the first process have reached only the eastern quarter of the province: the Dender and Waasland areas.\n\nHaving been dominated by the French, the Austrians and the Spanish, their languages have been other influences on the vocabulary of East Flemish.\n\n\nA special mention should go to continental West Flemish, which, despite being a West Flemish dialect, has some East Flemish colouring, as Kortrijk was historically governed under Ghent.\n\nEven though the East Flemish dialect area is one of the most diverse linguistic landscapes in Belgium, the dialects share some traits that set them apart from Standard Dutch as well as the neighbouring dialects:\n\nAs the realisation of phonemes can be quite divergent in different East Flemish dialects, the phonemes represented here are based on the most common Core East Flemish realisations.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe following table gives an overview of some common phonemes in stressed syllables. Many East Flemish dialects have lost the phonemic vowel length distinction, but the distincition is made in the following table for the dialects that have kept it. Also, the central vowel /ə/ occurs only in unstressed syllables and is often heavily reduced or even omitted in many dialects.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe following table shows the common diphthong phonemes in East Flemish, but it also includes some allophones or alternative realisations of the vowels mentioned above.\n\nNotes:\n\nAs in many other southern Dutch dialects, verbal constructions can take several forms, depending on stress, the position of the subject and the next word. Unlike West Flemish, however, there is no subjunctive mood. The following table gives the general rules of conjugation in the present tense and the regular example of \"zwieren\" (\"to toss\"). The spelling is based on Dutch orthography with the addition of  ̊  to show devoicing and  ̆  to show vowel shortening.\n\nNotes:\n\nLike most other Germanic languages, East Flemish differentiates between strong verbs and weak verbs. Even though there are a few strong verbs in East Flemish that are weak in Standard Dutch, the overall tendency is that East Flemish has more weak verbs. Unlike many other Germanic languages, the rules for the conjugation of the strong preterite are exactly the same as in the present tense. The weak preterite is formed by adding the suffix \"-\"dege\"\" (\"-\"tege\"\" when the stem ends in a voiceless consonant) to the verbal stem. While an \"-n\" is usually added in the first-person and the third-person plural, the t-ending is not added except in a few southwestern dialects.\n\nThe dialect of the province's capital, Ghent, is also different from the language of the surrounding region. The Brabantic expansion is believed to have started in Ghent, which has separated its speech from the other Flemish dialects. Some Brabantic traits were exported to other East Flemish dialects, but many were not. The most notable differences include \"n\"-dropping and the more extreme diphthongisation of \"ii\" and \"uu\". At the same time, Ghent resisted many innovations characteristic for rural East Flanders. In the 19th and the early 20th centuries, the French uvular \"r\" was adopted.\n"}
{"id": "36171096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36171096", "title": "Example-based machine translation", "text": "Example-based machine translation\n\nExample-based machine translation (EBMT) is a method of machine translation often characterized by its use of a bilingual corpus with parallel texts as its main knowledge base at run-time. It is essentially a translation by analogy and can be viewed as an implementation of a case-based reasoning approach to machine learning.\n\nAt the foundation of example-based machine translation is the idea of translation by analogy. When applied to the process of human translation, the idea that translation takes place by analogy is a rejection of the idea that people translate sentences by doing deep linguistic analysis. Instead, it is founded on the belief that people translate by first decomposing a sentence into certain phrases, then by translating these phrases, and finally by properly composing these fragments into one long sentence. Phrasal translations are translated by analogy to previous translations. The principle of translation by analogy is encoded to example-based machine translation through the example translations that are used to train such a system.\n\nOther approaches to machine translation, including statistical machine translation, also use bilingual corpora to learn the process of translation.\n\nExample-based machine translation was first suggested by Makoto Nagao in 1984. He pointed out that it is especially adapted to translation between two totally different languages, such as English and Japanese. In this case, one sentence can be translated into several well-structured sentences in another language, therefore, it is no use to do the deep linguistic analysis characteristic of rule-based machine translation.\n\nExample-based machine translation systems are trained from bilingual parallel corpora containing sentence pairs like the example shown in the table above. Sentence pairs contain sentences in one language with their translations into another. The particular example shows an example of a \"minimal pair\", meaning that the sentences vary by just one element. These sentences make it simple to learn translations of portions of a sentence. For example, an example-based machine translation system would learn three units of translation from the above example:\n\nComposing these units can be used to produce novel translations in the future. For example, if we have been trained using some text containing the sentences:\n\n\"President Kennedy was shot dead during the parade.\" and \"The convict escaped on July 15th.\" We could translate the sentence \"The convict was shot dead during the parade.\" by substituting the appropriate parts of the sentences.\n\nExample-based machine translation is best suited for sub-language phenomena like phrasal verbs. Phrasal verbs have highly context-dependent meanings. They are common in English, where they comprise a verb followed by an adverb and/or a preposition, which are called the particle to the verb. Phrasal verbs produce specialized context-specific meanings that may not be derived from the meaning of the constituents. There is almost always an ambiguity during word-to-word translation from source to the target language.\n\nAs an example, consider the phrasal verb \"put on\" and its Urdu/Hindi meaning. It may be used in any of the following ways:\n\n\n"}

(Compare with other vernacularisms from publishing lingo, such as the British \"penny dreadful\" and the American \"dime novel\".) This loanword, with its various corruptions, persists in numerous modern languages.\n\nIn England, with the 1665 founding of \"The Oxford Gazette\" (which became the \"London Gazette\"), the word \"gazette\" came to indicate a public journal of the government; today, such a journal is sometimes called a government gazette. For some governments, publishing information in a gazette was or is a legal necessity by which official documents come into force and enter the public domain. Such is the case for documents published in \"Royal Thai Government Gazette\" (est. 1858), and in \"The Gazette of India\" (est. 1950).\n\nThe government of the United Kingdom requires government gazettes of its member countries. Publication of the \"Edinburgh Gazette\", the official government newspaper in Scotland, began in 1699. The \"Dublin Gazette\" of Ireland followed in 1705, but ceased when the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom in 1922; the \"Iris Oifigiúil\" (Irish: \"Official Gazette\") replaced it. The \"Belfast Gazette\" of Northern Ireland published its first issue in 1921.\n\nIn English, the transitive verb \"to gazette\" means \"to announce or publish in a gazette\"; especially where \"gazette\" refers to a public journal or a newspaper of record. For example, \"Lake Nakuru was gazetted as a bird sanctuary in 1960 and upgraded to National Park status in 1968.\" British Army personnel decorations, promotions, and officer commissions are gazetted in the \"London Gazette\", the \"Official Newspaper of Record for the United Kingdom\". \"Gazettal\" (a noun) is the act of gazetting; for example, \"the gazettal of the bird sanctuary\".\n\n"}

Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.\n\nThe implementation of a grammar checker makes use of natural language processing.\n\nThe earliest \"grammar checkers\" were programs that checked for punctuation and style inconsistencies, rather than a complete range of possible grammatical errors. The first system was called Writer's Workbench, and was a set of writing tools included with Unix systems as far back as the 1970s. The whole \"Writer's Workbench\" package included several separate tools to check for various writing problems. The \"diction\" tool checked for wordy, trite, clichéd or misused phrases in a text. The tool would output a list of questionable phrases, and provide suggestions for improving the writing. The \"style\" tool analyzed the writing style of a given text. It performed a number of readability tests on the text and output the results, and gave some statistical information about the sentences of the text.\n\nAspen Software of Albuquerque, NM released the earliest version of a diction and style checker for personal computers, \"Grammatik\", in 1981. \"Grammatik\" was first available for a Radio Shack - TRS-80, and soon had versions for CP/M and the IBM PC. Reference Software of San Francisco, CA, acquired \"Grammatik\" in 1985. Development of \"Grammatik\" continued, and it became an actual grammar checker that could detect writing errors beyond simple style checking.\n\nOther early diction and style checking programs included \"Punctuation & Style\", \"Correct Grammar\", \"RightWriter\" and \"PowerEdit\". While all the earliest programs started out as simple diction and style checkers, all eventually added various levels of language processing, and developed some level of true grammar checking capability.\n\nUntil 1992, grammar checkers were sold as add-on programs. There were a large number of different word processing programs available at that time, with WordPerfect and Microsoft Word the top two in market share. In 1992, Microsoft decided to add grammar checking as a feature of Word, and licensed CorrecText, a grammar checker from Houghton Mifflin that had not yet been marketed as a standalone product. WordPerfect answered Microsoft's move by acquiring Reference Software, and the direct descendant of \"Grammatik\" is still included with WordPerfect.\n\nThere are free and open-source grammar checking software like LanguageTool.\n\nThe earliest writing style programs checked for wordy, trite, clichéd, or misused phrases in a text. This process was based on simple pattern matching. The heart of the program was a list of many hundreds or thousands of phrases that are considered poor writing by many experts. The list of questionable phrases included alternative wording for each phrase. The checking program would simply break text into sentences, check for any matches in the phrase dictionary, flag suspect phrases and show an alternative. These programs could also perform some mechanical checks. For example, they would typically flag doubled words, doubled punctuation, some capitalization errors, and other simple mechanical mistakes.\n\nTrue grammar checking is more complex. While a computer programming language has a very specific syntax and grammar, this is not so for natural languages. One can write a somewhat complete formal grammar for a natural language, but there are usually so many exceptions in real usage that a formal grammar is of minimal help in writing a grammar checker. One of the most important parts of a natural language grammar checker is a dictionary of all the words in the language, along with the part of speech of each word. The fact that a natural word may be used as any one of several different parts of speech (such as \"free\" being used as an adjective, adverb, noun, or verb) greatly increases the complexity of any grammar checker.\n\nA grammar checker will find each sentence in a text, look up each word in the dictionary, and then attempt to parse the sentence into a form that matches a grammar. Using various rules, the program can then detect various errors, such as agreement in tense, number, word order, and so on. It is also possible to detect some stylistic problems with the text. For example, some popular style guides such as The Elements of Style deprecate excessive use of the passive voice. Grammar checkers may attempt to identify passive sentences and suggest an active-voice alternative.\n\nThe software elements required for grammar checking are closely related to some of the development issues that need to be addressed for voice recognition software. In voice recognition, parsing can be used to help predict which word is most likely intended, based on part of speech and position in the sentence. In grammar checking, the parsing is used to detect words that fail to follow accepted grammar usage.\n\nRecently, research has focused on developing algorithms which can recognize grammar errors based on the context of the surrounding words. Context-based grammar checkers appear in Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Office 2007, Google Wave, Ghotit Dyslexia Software, Grammarly, SpellCheckPlus.com, Nounplus.net, GrammarCheck.net, PaperRater, Ginger Software, VirtualWritingTutor.com, and WhiteSmoke.\n\nGrammar checkers are considered as a type of foreign language writing aid which non-native speakers can use to proofread their writings as such programs endeavor to identify syntactical errors. However, as with other computerized writing aids such as spell checkers, popular grammar checkers are often criticized when they fail to spot errors and incorrectly flag correct text as erroneous. The linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum argued in 2007 that they were generally so inaccurate as to do more harm than good: \"for the most part, accepting the advice of a computer grammar checker on your prose will make it much worse, sometimes hilariously incoherent.\"\n\n"}

Gorin, and later ported to the C programming language and expanded by many others.\nIt is currently maintained by Geoff Kuenning.\nThe generalized affix description system introduced by ispell has since been imitated by other spelling\ncheckers such as MySpell.\n\nLike most computerized spelling checkers, ispell works by reading an input file word by word, stopping when a word is not found in its dictionary. Ispell then attempts to generate a list of possible corrections and presents the incorrect word and any suggestions to the user, who can then choose a correction, replace the word with a new one, leave it unchanged, or add it to the dictionary.\n\nIspell pioneered the idea of a programming interface, which was originally intended for use by emacs. Other applications have since used the feature to add spell-checking to their own interface, and GNU Aspell has adopted the same interface so that it can be used with the same set of applications.\n\nThere are ispell dictionaries for most widely spoken Western languages.\n\nIspell is available under a specific open-source license.\n\n\n"}

Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon, and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling. General Australian serves as the standard dialect. \n\nAccording to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for close to 73% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are: Mandarin (2.5%), Arabic (1.4%), Cantonese (1.2%), Vietnamese (1.2%) and Italian (1.2%). \n\nA considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual.\n\nOver 250 Indigenous Australian languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact, of which less than 20 are still in daily use by all age groups. About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people. At the time of the 2006 census, 52,000 Indigenous Australians, representing 12% of the Indigenous population, reported that they spoke an Indigenous language at home. Australia has a sign language known as Auslan, which is the main language of about 5,500 deaf people.\n\nIt is believed that there were almost 400 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait languages at the time of first European contact. Most of these are now either extinct or moribund, with only about fifteen languages still being spoken among all age groups of the relevant tribes.\n\nAn indigenous language remains the main language for about 50,000 (0.25%) people. Australia has a sign language known as Auslan, which is the main language that approximately 10,000 deaf people use. Chinese is by far the most spoken foreign language, with 715,000 speakers as of 2016, and has even been considered to be put on signs across Australia, to encourage tourists to explore and interact with other people.\n\nThe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island languages with the most speakers today are Upper Arrernte, Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Tiwi, Walmajarri, Warlpiri, and the Western Desert language.\n\nTwo languages are spoken on the islands of the Torres Strait, within Australian territory, by the Melanesian inhabitants of the area: Kalaw Lagaw Ya and Meriam. Meriam Mir is a Papuan language, while Kalaw Lagaw Ya is an Australian language.\n\nTwo English-based creoles have arisen in Australia after European contact: Kriol and Torres Strait Creole. Kriol is spoken in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, and Torres Strait Creole in Queensland and south-west Papua.\n\nBroome Pearling Lugger Pidgin was a pidgin used as a lingua franca between Malays, Japanese, Vietnamese, Torres Strait Islanders and Aborigines on pearling boats.\n\nThere has been a steady decline in the percentage of Australians who speak only English at home since at least 2001. According to the 2001 census, English was the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. By the 2006 census it had fallen to close to 79%, while in the 2011 census, that number had fallen to 76.8%. According to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for close to 72.7% of the population.

{"id": "551448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=551448", "title": "Liana", "text": "Liana\n\nA liana is any of various long-stemmed, woody vines that are rooted in the soil at ground level and use trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the canopy to get access to well-lit areas of the forest. Lianas are characteristic of tropical moist deciduous forests (especially seasonal forests), but may be found in temperate rainforests. There are also temperate lianas, for example the members of the \"Clematis\" or \"Vitis\" (wild grape) genera. Lianas can form bridges amidst the forest canopy, providing arboreal animals with paths across the forest. These bridges can protect weaker trees from strong winds. Lianas compete with forest trees for sunlight, water and nutrients from the soil. Forests without lianas grow 150% more fruit; trees with lianas have twice the probability of dying.\n\nThe term \"liana\" is not a taxonomic grouping, but rather a description of the way the plant grows – much like \"tree\" or \"shrub\". Lianas may be found in many different plant families. One way of distinguishing lianas from trees and shrubs is based on the stiffness, specifically, the Young's modulus of various parts of the stem. Trees and shrubs have young twigs and smaller branches which are quite flexible and older growth such as trunks and large branches which are stiffer. A liana often has stiff young growths and older, more flexible growth at the base of the stem.\n\nDescribed genera containing liana species include:\n\nGnetophyta\n\nAcanthaceae\nAncistrocladaceae\nAnnonaceae\nApocynaceae\nArecaceae (Palmae)\nAraceae\nAristolochiaceae\nBignoniaceae\nCapparaceae\nConnaraceae\nDilleniaceae\nDioscoreaceae\n\nFabaceae: perhaps not surprisingly, leguminous vines are well represented:<br>\n– Caesalpinioideae\n– Cercidoideae\n– Faboideae (Papilionoideae)\n\nFlagellariaceae (order Poales)\nLoganiaceae\nNepenthaceae\nOleaceae\nPolygalaceae\nSapindaceae\nRhamnaceae\nRubiaceae\nRutaceae\nSchlegeliaceae\nSmilacaceae\nVitaceae\n\nLianas compete intensely with trees, greatly reducing tree growth and tree reproduction, greatly increasing tree mortality, preventing tree seedlings from establishing, altering the course of regeneration in forests, and ultimately affecting tree population growth rates. Lianas also provide access routes in the forest canopy for many arboreal animals, including ants and many other invertebrates, lizards, rodents, sloths, monkeys, and lemurs. For example, in the Eastern tropical forests of Madagascar, many lemurs achieve higher mobility from the web of lianas draped amongst the vertical tree species. Many lemurs prefer trees with lianas for their roost sites. Lianas also provide support for trees when strong winds blow. However, they may be destructive in that when one tree falls, the connections made by the lianas may cause many other trees to fall.\n\nAs noted by Charles Darwin, because lianas are supported by other plants, they may conserve resources that other plants must allocate to the development of structure and use them instead for growth and reproduction. In general, lianas are detrimental to the trees that support them. Growth rates are lower for trees with lianas; they directly damage hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. Lianas also make the canopy of trees more accessible to animals which eat leaves. Because of these negative effects, trees which remain free of lianas are at an advantage; some species have evolved characteristics which help them avoid or shed lianas.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "22024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22024", "title": "Novial", "text": "Novial\n\nNovial [\"nov-\" (\"new\") + \"IAL, International Auxiliary Language\"] is a constructed international auxiliary language (IAL) for universal communication between speakers of different native languages. It was devised by Otto Jespersen, a Danish linguist who had been involved in the Ido movement, and later in the development of Interlingua de IALA.\n\nIts vocabulary is based largely on the Germanic and Romance languages and its grammar is influenced by English.\n\nNovial was introduced in Jespersen's book \"An International Language\" in 1928. It was updated in his dictionary \"Novial Lexike\" in 1930, and further modifications were proposed in the 1930s, but the language became dormant with Jespersen's death in 1943. In the 1990s, with the revival of interest in constructed languages brought on by the Internet, some people rediscovered Novial.\n\nNovial was first described in Jespersen’s book \"An International Language\" (1928). Part One of the book discusses the need for an IAL, the disadvantages of ethnic languages for that purpose, and common objections to constructed IALs. He also provides a critical overview of the history of constructed IALs with sections devoted to Volapük, Esperanto, Idiom Neutral, Ido, Latino sine Flexione and Occidental (Interlingue). The author makes it clear that he draws on a wealth of earlier work on the problem of a constructed IAL, not only the aforementioned IALs.\n\nPart Two of \"An International Language\" describes Novial in detail. Alternative possible solutions for problems in the phonology, orthography, grammar and vocabulary are considered. The choices made are explained by comparison with ethnic languages and previously constructed IALs.\n\nJespersen suggested that it might be possible instead of the digraph SH to use the phonetic symbol ʃ.\n\nIn Novial, nominative and oblique pronouns are identical.\n\nThe standard word order is subject-verb-object, as in English. Therefore, the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject:\nE.g.:\n\nThe accusative (direct object) is therefore most often identical to the nominative (subject). However, in case of an ambiguity problem, an optional accusative ending, -m (-em after a consonant), is available but is rarely used. The preposition em is equivalent to this ending.\n\nThe personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding -n or after a consonant -en. This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so \"men\" means both \"my\" and \"mine\" (\"of me\"):\nE.g.:\n\nPossession may also be expressed with the preposition de: \"de me\", \"de vu\", and so on.\n\nVerb forms never change with person or number. Most verb tenses, moods and voices are expressed with auxiliary verbs preceding the root form of the main verb. The auxiliaries follow the same word order as the English equivalent. The pronouns are indicated with parentheses and are given for example purposes.\n\n\nNovial clearly distinguishes the passive of becoming and the passive of being. In English the forms are often the same, using the auxiliary verb \"to be\" followed by the past participle. However, the passive of becoming is also often expressed with the verb \"to get\" which is used in the examples below.\n\nThe passive voice of becoming is formed with the auxiliary bli followed by the root verb form.\n\nThe passive voice of being is formed with the auxiliary es followed by the past passive participle (stem + -t).\n\nThe definite article is \"li\" which is invariant. It is used as in English.\n\nThere is no indefinite article, although \"un\" (one) can be used.\n\nThe plural noun is formed by adding –s to the singular (-es after a consonant).\n\nThe accusative case is generally identical to the nominative but can optionally be marked with the ending -m (-em after a consonant) with the plural being -sem (-esem after a consonant) or with the preposition em.\n\nThe genitive is formed with the ending -n (-en after a consonant) with the plural being -sen (-esen after a consonant) or with the preposition de.\n\nOther cases are formed with prepositions.\n\nAll adjectives end in -i, but this may be dropped if it is easy enough to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun qualified. Adjectives do not agree with the noun but may be given noun endings if there is no noun present to receive them.\n\nComparative adjectives are formed by placing various particles (\"plu, tam,\" and \"min\") in front of the adjective receiving the comparison. Likewise, the superlative particles (\"maxim\" and \"minim\") precede the adjective. The adjective does not receive an inflection to its ending.\n\nAn adjective is converted to a corresponding adverb by adding -m after the -i ending of the adjective.\n\nComparative and superlative adverbs are formed in the same manner as comparative and superlative adjectives: by placing a specific particle before the adverb receiving the comparison.\n\nSee the and at the Novial Wikibook.\n\nJespersen was a professional linguist, unlike Esperanto's creator. He disliked the arbitrary and artificial character that he found in Esperanto and Ido. Additionally, he objected to those languages' inflectional systems, which he found needlessly complex. He sought to make Novial at once euphonious and regular while also preserving useful structures from natural languages.\n\nIn Novial:\n\nA major difference between Novial and Esperanto/Ido concerns noun endings. Jespersen rejected a single vowel to terminate all nouns (-o in Esperanto/Ido), finding it unnatural and potentially confusing. Instead, Novial nouns may end in \"-o\", \"-a\", \"-e\", or \"-u\" or \"-um\". These endings may be taken to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages. Also there is no grammatical gender or requirement for adjectives to agree with nouns.\n\nHere is the Lord's Prayer in Novial and several related languages:\nAs Jespersen relates in his autobiography, in 1934 he proposed an orthographic reform to Novial, which displeased a part of the users. Jespersen abandoned the essential principle of \"one sound, one letter\" :\n\n\n"}

Like other sign languages, FSL is a unique language with its own grammar, syntax and morphology; it is neither based on nor resembles Filipino or English. Some researchers consider the indigenous signs of FSL to be at risk of being lost due to the increasing influence of foreign sign languages such as ASL.\n\nThe Republic Act 11106 or The Filipino Sign Language Act, effective November 27, 2018, declared FSL as the national sign language of the Filipino Deaf.\nFSL is believed to be part of the French Sign Language family. It has been strongly influenced by American Sign Language since the establishment in 1907 of the School for the Deaf and Blind (SDB) (now the Philippine School for the Deaf) by Delia Delight Rice (1883-1964), an American Thomasite teacher born to deaf parents. The school was run and managed by American principals until the 1940s. In the 1960s, contact with American Sign Language continued through the launching of the Deaf Evangelistic Alliance Foundation and the Laguna Christian College for the Deaf. Another source of ASL influence was the assignment of volunteers from the United States Peace Corps, who were stationed at various places in the Philippines from 1974 through 1989, as well as religious organizations that promoted ASL and Manually Coded English. Starting in 1982, the International Deaf Education Association (IDEA), led by former Peace Corps volunteer G. Dennis Drake, established a series of residential elementary programs in Bohol using Philippine Sign Language as the primary language of instruction. The Bohol Deaf Academy also primarily emphasizes Philippine Sign Language.\n\nAccording to sign language researcher Dr. Lisa Martinez, FSL and ASL deviate across three important metrics: different overall form (especially a differing handshape inventory), different methods of sign formation, and different grammar.\n\nUsage of Filipino Sign Language was reported in 2009 as being used by 54% of sign-language users in the Philippines. In 2011, the Department of Education declared Signing Exact English the language of deaf education in the Philippines. In 2011, Department of Education officials announced in a forum that hearing-impaired children were being taught and would continue to be taught using Signing Exact English (SEE) instead of Filipino Sign Language (FSL). In 2012, House Bill No. 450 was introduced in the Philippine House of Representatives to declare FSL as the National Sign Language of the Philippines and to mandate its use as the medium of official communication in all transactions involving the deaf and the language of instruction of deaf education. , that bill was pending with the Committee on Social Services.\n\nOn October 30, 2018, Republic Act 11106 or The Filipino Sign Language Act was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte declaring the Filipino Sign Language as the national sign language of the Filipino Deaf. The law also declares the country's national sign language as the official sign language of the government in all transactions involving the deaf.\n\nThe law, which seeks to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the Filipino Deaf, also mandates the use of the Filipino Sign Language in schools, broadcast media, and workplaces. It also mandates the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino, in consultation with the stakeholders, to establish a national system of standards and procedures for the interpretation of the Filipino Sign Language. The University of the Philippines and other education agencies are tasked to develop guidelines for the development of training materials in the education of the Deaf. The law also require the availability of qualified sign language interpreters in all hearings, proceedings, and government transactions involving the Deaf. \n\n“The FSL shall be recognized, promoted and supported as the medium of official communication in all transactions involving the deaf, and as the language of instruction of deaf education, without prejudice to the use of other forms of communications depending on individual choice or preference,” the law states. The Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHEd), Technical Education, and Skills Development Authority (Tesda), and all other national and local government agencies involved in the education of the deaf, are tasked to use and coordinate with each other on the use of FSL as the medium of instruction in deaf education.\n\nThe law will become effective on November 27, 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27530710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27530710", "title": "Phoenix club (sports)", "text": "Phoenix club (sports)\n\nThe term phoenix club is one used in professional team sports to refer to a new parent company that is set up to replace the parent company of a club that has failed in business terms but not in sporting terms, ideally while maintaining the continuity of the sporting activity. In some cases, the phoenix club is created by the supporters of the club which has ended (or appears to be on the point of ending). A phoenix club will often have the same or similar name, logo and playing uniform to the original club. The term is particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom in relation to association football, though it is also used in other countries.\n\nThe term is also occasionally used to refer to a club formed by disgruntled supporters of a major team when a change of ownership or policy causes them to lose faith in the management of their favoured side (as happened in 2005 when F.C. United of Manchester were formed by fans of Manchester United as a protest at the sale of the latter to Malcolm Glazer). although their status as such may be disputed if the original club is still in existence at the time.\n\nThe term is taken from the mythical phoenix bird, which is said to resurrect itself from its own ashes. In the Australia-New Zealand A-League the demise of the sole New Zealand team, New Zealand Knights, resulted in the newly created club actually calling itself the Phoenix, albeit that the club moved to a different city, Wellington.\n\nIn some cases, phoenix clubs will retain the name of the club which they replaced, implying a continuation from the former team. In other cases, name changes occur, perhaps due to proprietorial ownership existing on the old club's name. An American football example is the Cleveland Browns, the original franchise of which moved to Baltimore in 1995 to become the Baltimore Ravens; the NFL however stipulated as part of the move the franchise would not be able to keep the team history and records of the Browns, a cornerstone NFL franchise. In 1999, the \"new\" Browns were granted an expansion franchise and were awarded all of the former team's history by the league, even though the extant Ravens had the original Browns players and personnel.\n\nIt does not also include teams that relocated and/or have been renamed as a going concern, although many of the former may have their founding date as the day they have moved and still have strong links to their past, however they are considered to be the same club and therefore cannot be a phoenix (unless their previous entity officially folded and was liquidated).\n\nHowever, the term \"phoenix club\" is one that could be disputed depending on the criteria used, as there is no single universally accepted definition. Furthermore, there may be changes in what each country's football governing body and legal system defines as a phoenix club and not a resurrected club.\n\n A.D. Generaleña merged with A.D. Pérez Zeledón to become Municipal Pérez Zeledón, \"de facto\" only continuing the Pérez Zeledón heritage.\n\n Wimbledon F.C. became Milton Keynes Dons F.C. in 2004, two years after the foundation of AFC Wimbledon; see Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes.\n\nIn the early 21st century, several Italian clubs endured severe economic problems. Some, most notably Fiorentina, Napoli, Parma and Torino were each declared bankrupt and had to reapply to play at a lower level with new owner and new corporate entity. All are considered to be the same clubs before and after the bankruptcy rather than separate phoenix entities; They obtained the \"sports title\" to remain in the Italy football pyramid using clauses in the Article 52 of N.O.I.F..\n\n Airdrieonians F.C. (1878) were liquidated in 2002 but their owners bought Clydebank and rebranded it as Airdrie United (now known as Airdrieonians F.C. (2002)); therefore that club is not a phoenix as it took the place of an existing entity. However the current incarnation of Clydebank is a phoenix, as it was founded by supporters to replace the entity which had moved to Airdrie and had to restart at the bottom of the (Junior) league pyramid.\n\nDuring the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club plc in 2012, a new company, set up for the purpose, bought the assets of the business and secured the transfer of its SFA membership, which allowed Rangers F.C. to continue playing, albeit having to start again in the lowest national division of the Scottish football league system. It is regarded as a continuation of the same club by the relevant authorities.\n"}

{"id": "44816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44816", "title": "Pragmatics", "text": "Pragmatics\n\nPragmatics is a subfield of linguistics and semiotics that studies the ways in which context contributes to meaning. Pragmatics encompasses speech act theory, conversational implicature, talk in interaction and other approaches to language behavior in philosophy, sociology, linguistics and anthropology. Unlike semantics, which examines meaning that is conventional or \"coded\" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (e.g., grammar, lexicon, etc.) of the speaker and listener, but also on the context of the utterance, any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred intent of the speaker, and other factors. In this respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent ambiguity, since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.\n\nThe ability to understand another speaker's intended meaning is called \"pragmatic competence\".\n\nThe sentence \"You have a green light\" is ambiguous. Without knowing the context, the identity of the speaker or the speaker's intent, it is difficult to infer the meaning with certainty. For example, it could mean:\nSimilarly, the sentence \"Sherlock saw the man with binoculars\" could mean that Sherlock observed the man by using binoculars, or it could mean that Sherlock observed a man who was holding binoculars (\"syntactic ambiguity\"). The meaning of the sentence depends on an understanding of the context and the speaker's intent. As defined in linguistics, a sentence is an abstract entity—a string of words divorced from non-linguistic context—as opposed to an utterance, which is a concrete example of a speech act in a specific context. The more closely conscious subjects stick to common words, idioms, phrasings, and topics, the more easily others can surmise their meaning; the further they stray from common expressions and topics, the wider the variations in interpretations. This suggests that sentences do not have intrinsic meaning, that there is no meaning associated with a sentence or word, and that either can only represent an idea symbolically. \"The cat sat on the mat\" is a sentence in English. If someone were to say to someone else, \"The cat sat on the mat,\" the act is itself an utterance. This implies that a sentence, term, expression or word cannot symbolically represent a single true meaning; such meaning is underspecified (which cat sat on which mat?) and potentially ambiguous. By contrast, the meaning of an utterance can be inferred through knowledge of both its linguistic and non-linguistic contexts (which may or may not be sufficient to resolve ambiguity). In mathematics, with Berry's paradox, there arises a similar systematic ambiguity with the word \"definable\".\n\nThe word \"pragmatics\" derives via Latin \"pragmaticus\" from the Greek πραγματικός (\"pragmatikos\"), meaning amongst others \"fit for action\", which comes from πρᾶγμα (\"pragma\"), \"deed, act\", and that from πράσσω (\"prassō\"), \"to pass over, to practise, to achieve\".\n\nPragmatics was a reaction to structuralist linguistics as outlined by Ferdinand de Saussure. In many cases, it expanded upon his idea that language has an analyzable structure, composed of parts that can be defined in relation to others. Pragmatics first engaged only in synchronic study, as opposed to examining the historical development of language. However, it rejected the notion that all meaning comes from signs existing purely in the abstract space of \"langue\". Meanwhile, historical pragmatics has also come into being. This field only gained linguists' attention in the 70s. This is when two different schools emerged; notably the Anglo-American pragmatic thought and the European continental pragmatic thought (also called the perspective view).\n\n\nWhen we speak of the referential uses of language we are talking about how we use signs to refer to certain items. Below is an explanation of, first, what a sign is, second, how meanings are accomplished through its usage.\n\nA sign is the link or relationship between a signified and the signifier as defined by Saussure and Huguenin. The signified is some entity or concept in the world. The signifier represents the signified. An example would be:\n\nThe relationship between the two gives the sign meaning. This relationship can be further explained by considering what we mean by \"meaning.\" In pragmatics, there are two different types of meaning to consider: semantico-referential meaning and indexical meaning. Semantico-referential meaning refers to the aspect of meaning, which describes events in the world that are independent of the circumstance they are uttered in. An example would be propositions such as:\n\nIn this case, the proposition is describing that Santa Claus eats cookies. The meaning of this proposition does not rely on whether or not Santa Claus is eating cookies at the time of its utterance. Santa Claus could be eating cookies at any time and the meaning of the proposition would remain the same. The meaning is simply describing something that is the case in the world. In contrast, the proposition, \"Santa Claus is eating a cookie right now,\" describes events that are happening at the time the proposition is uttered.\n\nSemantico-referential meaning is also present in meta-semantical statements such as:\n\nIf someone were to say that a tiger is a carnivorous animal in one context and a mammal in another, the definition of tiger would still be the same. The meaning of the sign tiger is describing some animal in the world, which does not change in either circumstance.\n\nIndexical meaning, on the other hand, is dependent on the context of the utterance and has rules of use. By rules of use, it is meant that indexicals can tell you when they are used, but not what they actually mean.\n\nWhom \"I\" refers to depends on the context and the person uttering it.\n\nAs mentioned, these meanings are brought about through the relationship between the signified and the signifier. One way to define the relationship is by placing signs in two categories: referential indexical signs, also called \"shifters,\" and pure indexical signs.\n\nReferential indexical signs are signs where the meaning shifts depending on the context hence the nickname \"shifters.\" 'I' would be considered a referential indexical sign. The referential aspect of its meaning would be '1st person singular' while the indexical aspect would be the person who is speaking (refer above for definitions of semantico-referential and indexical meaning). Another example would be:\n\nA pure indexical sign does not contribute to the meaning of the propositions at all. It is an example of a \"non-referential use of language.\"\n\nA second way to define the signified and signifier relationship is C.S. Peirce's Peircean Trichotomy. The components of the trichotomy are the following:\n\nThese relationships allow us to use signs to convey what we want to say. If two people were in a room and one of them wanted to refer to a characteristic of a chair in the room he would say \"this chair has four legs\" instead of \"a chair has four legs.\" The former relies on context (indexical and referential meaning) by referring to a chair specifically in the room at that moment while the latter is independent of the context (semantico-referential meaning), meaning the concept chair.\n\nMichael Silverstein has argued that \"nonreferential\" or \"pure\" indices do not contribute to an utterance's referential meaning but instead \"signal some particular value of one or more contextual variables.\" Although nonreferential indexes are devoid of semantico-referential meaning, they do encode \"pragmatic\" meaning.\n\nThe sorts of contexts that such indexes can mark are varied. Examples include:\n\nIn all of these cases, the semantico-referential meaning of the utterances is unchanged from that of the other possible (but often impermissible) forms, but the pragmatic meaning is vastly different.\n\nJ.L. Austin introduced the concept of the performative, contrasted in his writing with \"constative\" (i.e. descriptive) utterances. According to Austin's original formulation, a performative is a type of utterance characterized by two distinctive features:\n\n\nExamples:\n\nTo be performative, an utterance must conform to various conditions involving what Austin calls felicity. These deal with things like appropriate context and the speaker's authority. For instance, when a couple has been arguing and the husband says to his wife that he accepts her apology even though she has offered nothing approaching an apology, his assertion is infelicitous—because she has made neither expression of regret nor request for forgiveness, there exists none to accept, and thus no act of accepting can possibly happen.\n\nRoman Jakobson, expanding on the work of Karl Bühler, described six \"constitutive factors\" of a speech event, each of which represents the privileging of a corresponding function, and only one of which is the referential (which corresponds to the context of the speech event). The six constitutive factors and their corresponding functions are diagrammed below.\n\nThe six constitutive factors of a speech event\n\nAddresser---------------------Addressee\n\nThe six functions of language\n\nEmotive-----------------------Conative\n\n\nThere is considerable overlap between pragmatics and sociolinguistics, since both share an interest in linguistic meaning as determined by usage in a speech community. However, sociolinguists tend to be more interested in variations in language within such communities.\n\nPragmatics helps anthropologists relate elements of language to broader social phenomena; it thus pervades the field of linguistic anthropology. Because pragmatics describes generally the forces in play for a given utterance, it includes the study of power, gender, race, identity, and their interactions with individual speech acts. For example, the study of code switching directly relates to pragmatics, since a switch in code effects a shift in pragmatic force.\n\nAccording to Charles W. Morris, pragmatics tries to understand the relationship between signs and their users, while semantics tends to focus on the actual objects or ideas to which a word refers, and syntax (or \"syntactics\") examines relationships among signs or symbols. Semantics is the literal meaning of an idea whereas pragmatics is the implied meaning of the given idea.\n\nSpeech Act Theory, pioneered by J.L. Austin and further developed by John Searle, centers around the idea of the performative, a type of utterance that performs the very action it describes. Speech Act Theory's examination of Illocutionary Acts has many of the same goals as pragmatics, as outlined above.\n\nComputational Pragmatics, as defined by Victoria Fromkin, concerns how humans can communicate their intentions to computers with as little ambiguity as possible. This process, integral to the science of natural language processing (seen as a sub-discipline of artificial intelligence), involves providing a computer system with some database of knowledge related to a topic and a series of algorithms which control how the system responds to incoming data, using contextual knowledge to more accurately approximate natural human language and information processing abilities. Reference resolution, how a computer determines when two objects are different or not, is one of the most important tasks of computational pragmatics. \n\nThere has been a great amount of discussion on the boundary between semantics and pragmatics and there are many different formalizations of aspects of pragmatics linked to context dependence. Particularly interesting cases are the discussions on the semantics of indexicals and the problem of referential descriptions, a topic developed after the theories of Keith Donnellan. A proper logical theory of formal pragmatics has been developed by Carlo Dalla Pozza, according to which it is possible to connect classical semantics (treating propositional contents as true or false) and intuitionistic semantics (dealing with illocutionary forces). The presentation of a formal treatment of pragmatics appears to be a development of the Fregean idea of assertion sign as formal sign of the act of assertion.\n\nPragmatics (more specifically, Speech Act Theory's notion of the performative) underpins Judith Butler's theory of gender performativity. In \"Gender Trouble\", she claims that gender and sex are not natural categories, but socially constructed roles produced by \"reiterative acting.\"\n\nIn she extends her theory of performativity to hate speech and censorship, arguing that censorship necessarily strengthens any discourse it tries to suppress and therefore, since the state has sole power to define hate speech legally, it is the state that makes hate speech performative.\n\nJacques Derrida remarked that some work done under Pragmatics aligned well with the program he outlined in his book \"Of Grammatology\".\n\nÉmile Benveniste argued that the pronouns \"I\" and \"you\" are fundamentally distinct from other pronouns because of their role in creating the subject.\n\nGilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari discuss linguistic pragmatics in the fourth chapter of \"A Thousand Plateaus\" (\"November 20, 1923--Postulates of Linguistics\"). They draw three conclusions from Austin: (1) A performative utterance does not communicate information about an act second-hand—it is the act; (2) Every aspect of language (\"semantics, syntactics, or even phonematics\") functionally interacts with pragmatics; (3) There is no distinction between language and speech. This last conclusion attempts to refute Saussure's division between \"langue\" and \"parole\" and Chomsky's distinction between surface structure and deep structure simultaneously.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43038", "title": "Propitiation", "text": "Propitiation\n\nPropitiation, also called expiation, is the act of appeasing or making well-disposed a deity, thus incurring divine favor or avoiding divine retribution.\n\nIn the NASB translates \"propitiation\" from the Greek word \"hilasterion\". Concretely it specifically means the lid of The Ark of The Covenant. The only other occurrence of \"hilasterion\" in the NT is in , where the NASB translates it as \"mercy seat\".\n\nFor many Christians it has the meaning of \"that which expiates or propitiates\" or \"the gift which procures propitiation\". (KJV) reads: \"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.\" There is frequent similar use of \"hilasterion\" in the Septuagint, ff. The mercy seat was sprinkled with blood on Yom Kippur (), representing that the righteous sentence of the Law had been executed, changing a judgment seat into a mercy seat (; compare with \"throne of grace\" in ; place of communion, ().\n\nAnother Greek word, \"hilasmos\", is used for Christ as our propitiation in 1 John 2:2; 4:10; and in the Septuagint (; ; ). The thought in the OT sacrifices and in the NT fulfillment, is that Christ completely satisfied the just demands of the Holy Father for judgment on sin, by his death at Calvary (). \"TDNT,\" however, takes a different view of \"Hebrews: \"\"If the author uses the ritual as a means to portray Christ’s work, he also finds that in the new covenant the literal offerings of the ritual are replaced by the obedience of Christ (10:5ff.; cf. Ps. 40) and the Christian ministry of praise and mutual service (13:15-16; cf. Ps. 50). In other words, total self-giving, first that of Christ, and then, on this basis, that of his people, is the true meaning of sacrifice.\n\nGod, in view of the cross, is declared righteous in having been able to justify sins in the OT period, as well as in being able to forgive sinners under the New Covenant (; cf. , note).\n\nThe case for translating \"hilasterion\" as \"expiation\" instead of \"propitiation\" was put forward by C. H. Dodd in 1935 and at first gained wide support. \"Hilasterion\" is translated as \"expiation\" in the New American Bible (Revised Edition) and as \"sacrifice of atonement\" in the New Revised Standard Version. Dodd argued that in pagan Greek the translation of \"hilasterion\" was indeed to propitiate, but that in the Septuagint (the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew OT) that \"kapporeth\" (Hebrew for \"covering\") is often translated with words that mean \"to cleanse or remove\". This view was challenged by Leon Morris who argued that because of the focus in the book of Romans on God's wrath, that the concept of \"hilasterion\" needed to include the appeasement of God's wrath. Dodd's study is also criticized by David Hill in his semantic study of \"hilasterion\", in the book \"Greek Words and Hebrew Meanings: Studies in the Semantics of Soteriological Terms\". Hill claims that Dodd leaves out several Septuagint references to propitiation, and also cites apocryphal sources.\n\nTheologians stress the idea of propitiation because it specifically addresses dealing with God's wrath. Critics of penal substitutionary atonement state that seeing the Atonement as appeasing God is a pagan idea that makes God seem tyrannical.\n\nJ.I. Packer in \"Knowing God\" designates a distinct difference between pagan and Christian propitiation: \"In paganism, man propitiates his gods, and religion becomes a form of commercialism and, indeed, of bribery. In Christianity, however, God propitiates his wrath by his own action. He set forth Jesus Christ... to be the propitiation of our sins.\"\n\nJohn Stott writes that propitiation \"does not make God gracious...God does not love us because Christ died for us, Christ died for us because God loves us\". John Calvin, quoting Augustine from \"John's Gospel\" cx.6, writes, \"Our being reconciled by the death of Christ must not be understood as if the Son reconciled us, in order that the Father, then hating, might begin to love us\". Continuing the quote: \"... but that we were reconciled to him already, loving, though at enmity with us because of sin. To the truth of both propositions we have the attestation of the Apostle, 'God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,' (Rom. 5: 8.) Therefore he had this love towards us even when, exercising enmity towards him, we were the workers of iniquity. Accordingly in a manner wondrous and divine, he loved even when he hated us.\" \n\nPacker also cites God's love as the impetus that provides Christ's sacrifice for the reconciliation of mankind and hence the removal of God's wrath. According to Packer, propitiation (and the wrath of God that propitiation implies) is necessary to properly define God's love; God could not be righteous and \"His love would degenerate into sentimentality (without Christ's death containing aspects of propitiation).The wrath of God is as personal, and as potent, as his Love.\"\n\nThus the definition of Christian propitiation asserted by Calvin, Packer and Murray holds that within God there is a dichotomy of love and anger, but through propitiation love trumps anger, abolishing it. \"'The doctrine of the propitiation is precisely this that God loved the objects of His wrath so much that He gave His own Son to the end that He by His blood should make provision for the removal of this wrath... (John Murray, The Atonement, p.15)'\"\n\nThe \"New Jerome Biblical Commentary\" consistently argues that in the NT sacrifice (\"hilasterion\") does not appease God’s wrath but is best expressed from its Jewish roots (76.89-95) as atonement or expiation (82.73). Recent Catholic studies have depended heavily on the Trinitarian perspective presented by Edward J. Kilmartin:\n\n"}

{"id": "210960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210960", "title": "Recoil", "text": "Recoil\n\nRecoil (often called knockback, kickback or simply kick) is the backward movement of a gun when it is discharged. In technical terms, the recoil momentum acquired by the gun exactly balances the forward momentum of the projectile and exhaust gases (ejecta), according to Newton's third law, known as conservation of momentum. In hand-held small arms, the recoil momentum is transferred to the ground through the body of the shooter; while in heavier guns such as mounted machine guns or cannons, recoil momentum is transferred to the ground through the mount. \n\nIn order to bring the rearward moving gun to a halt, the momentum acquired by the gun is dissipated by a forward acting counter-recoil force applied to the gun over a period of time after the projectile exits the muzzle. To apply this counter-recoiling force, modern mounted guns may employ recoil buffering comprising springs and hydraulic recoil mechanisms, similar to shock absorbing suspension on automobiles. Early cannons used systems of ropes along with rolling or sliding friction to provide forces to slow the recoiling cannon to a stop. Recoil buffering allows the maximum counter-recoil force to be lowered so that strength limitations of the gun mount are not exceeded. Gun chamber pressures and projectile acceleration forces are tremendous, on the order of tens of thousands of pounds per square inch and tens of thousands of times the acceleration of gravity (g's), both necessary to launch the projectile at useful velocity during the very short travel distance of the barrel. However, the same pressures acting on the base of the projectile are acting on the rear face of the gun chamber, accelerating the gun rearward during firing. Practical weight gun mounts are typically not strong enough to withstand the maximum forces accelerating the projectile during the short time the projectile is in the barrel, typically only a few milliseconds. To mitigate these large recoil forces, recoil buffering mechanisms spread out the counter-recoiling force over a longer time, typically ten to a hundred times longer than the duration of the forces accelerating the projectile. This results in the required counter-recoiling force being proportionally lower, and easily absorbed by the gun mount. Modern cannons also employ muzzle brakes very effectively to redirect some of the propellant gasses rearward after projectile exit. This provides a counter-recoiling force to the barrel, allowing the buffering system and gun mount to be more efficiently designed at even lower weight. \"Recoilless\" guns, (recoilless rifle), also exist where much of the high pressure gas remaining in the barrel after projectile exit is vented rearward though a nozzle at the back of the chamber, creating a large counter-recoiling force sufficient to eliminate the need for heavy recoil mitigating buffers on the mount. \n\nThe same physics affecting recoil in mounted guns and cannons applies to hand-held guns. However, the shooter's body assumes the role of gun mount, and must similarly dissipate the gun's recoiling momentum over a longer period of time than the bullet travel-time in the barrel, in order not to injure the shooter. Hands, arms and shoulders have considerable strength and elasticity for this purpose, up to certain practical limits. Nevertheless, \"perceived\" recoil limits vary from shooter to shooter, depending on body size, the use of recoil padding, individual pain tolerance, the weight of the firearm, and whether recoil buffering systems and muzzle brakes are employed. For this reason, establishing recoil safety standards for small arms remains challenging, in spite of the straight-forward physics involved.\n\nA change in momentum of a mass requires a force; according to Newton's first law, known as the law of inertia, inertia simply being another term for mass. That force, applied to a mass, creates an acceleration, which when applied over time, changes the velocity of a mass. According to Newton's second law, the law of momentum -- changing the velocity of the mass changes its momentum, (mass multiplied by velocity). It is important to understand at this point that velocity is not simply speed. Velocity is the speed of a mass in a particular direction. In a very technical sense, speed is a scalar (mathematics), a magnitude, and velocity is a vector (physics), magnitude and direction. Newton's third law, known as conservation of momentum, recognizes that changes in the motion of a mass, brought about by the application of forces and accelerations, does not occur in isolation; that is, other bodies of mass are found to be involved in directing those forces and accelerations. Furthermore, if all the masses and velocities involved are accounted for, the vector sum, magnitude and direction, of the momentum of all the bodies involved does not change; hence, momentum of the system is conserved. This conservation of momentum is why gun recoil occurs in the opposite direction of bullet projection -- the mass times velocity of the projectile in the positive direction equals the mass times velocity of the gun in the negative direction. In summation, the total momentum of the system equals zero, surprisingly just as it did before the trigger was pulled. From a practical engineering perspective, therefore, through the mathematical application of conservation of momentum, it is possible to calculate a first approximation of a gun’s recoil momentum and kinetic energy, and properly design recoil buffering systems to safely dissipate that momentum and energy, simply based on estimates of the projectile speed (and mass) coming out the barrel. To confirm analytical calculations and estimates, once a prototype gun is manufactured, the projectile and gun recoil energy and momentum can be directly measured using a ballistic pendulum and ballistic chronograph.\n\nThere are two conservation laws at work when a gun is fired: conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. Recoil is explained by the law of conservation of momentum, and so it is easier to discuss it separately from energy.\n\nThe nature of the recoil process is determined by the force of the expanding gases in the barrel upon the gun (recoil force), which is equal and opposite to the force upon the ejecta. It is also determined by the counter-recoil force applied to the gun (e.g. an operator's hand or shoulder, or a mount). The recoil force only acts during the time that the ejecta are still in the barrel of the gun. The counter-recoil force is generally applied over a longer time period and adds forward momentum to the gun equal to the backward momentum supplied by the recoil force, in order to bring the gun to a halt. There are two special cases of counter recoil force: Free-recoil, in which the time duration of the counter-recoil force is very much larger than the duration of the recoil force, and zero-recoil, in which the counter-recoil force matches the recoil force in magnitude and duration. Except for the case of zero-recoil, the counter-recoil force is smaller than the recoil force but lasts for a longer time. Since the recoil force and the counter-recoil force are not matched, the gun will move rearward, slowing down until it comes to rest. In the zero-recoil case, the two forces are matched and the gun will not move when fired. In most cases, a gun is very close to a free-recoil condition, since the recoil process generally lasts much longer than the time needed to move the ejecta down the barrel. An example of near zero-recoil would be a gun securely clamped to a massive or well-anchored table, or supported from behind by a massive wall. However, employing zero-recoil systems is often neither practical nor safe for the structure of the gun, as the recoil momentum must be absorbed directly through the very small distance of elastic deformation of the materials the gun and mount are made from, perhaps exceeding their strength limits. For example, placing the butt of a large caliber gun directly against a wall and pulling the trigger risks cracking both the gun stock and the surface of the wall. \n\nThe recoil of a firearm, whether large or small, is a result of the law of conservation of momentum. Assuming that the firearm and projectile are both at rest before firing, then their total momentum is zero. Assuming a near free-recoil condition, and neglecting the gases ejected from the barrel, (an acceptable first estimate), then immediately after firing, conservation of momentum requires that the total momentum of the firearm and projectile is the same as before, namely zero. Stating this mathematically:\nwhere formula_2 is the momentum of the firearm and formula_3 is the momentum of the projectile. In other words, immediately after firing, the momentum of the firearm is equal and opposite to the momentum of the projectile.\n\nSince momentum of a body is defined as its mass multiplied by its velocity, we can rewrite the above equation as:\nwhere:\n\nA force integrated over the time period during which it acts will yield the momentum supplied by that force. The counter-recoil force must supply enough momentum to the firearm to bring it to a halt. This means that:\n\nwhere:\n\nA similar equation can be written for the recoil force on the firearm:\n\nwhere:\n\nAssuming the forces are somewhat evenly spread out over their respective durations, the condition for free-recoil is formula_15, while for zero-recoil, formula_16.\n\nFor a gun firing under free-recoil conditions, the force on the gun may not only force the gun backwards, but may also cause it to rotate about its center of mass or recoil mount. This is particularly true of older firearms, such as the classic Kentucky rifle, where the butt stock angles down significantly lower than the barrel, providing a pivot point about which the muzzle may rise during recoil. Modern firearms, such as the M16 rifle, employ stock designs that are in direct line with the barrel, in order to minimize any rotational effects. If there is an angle for the recoil parts to rotate about, the torque (formula_17) on the gun is given by:\n\nwhere formula_19 is the perpendicular distance of the center of mass of the gun below the barrel axis, formula_20 is the force on the gun due to the expanding gases, equal and opposite to the force on the bullet, formula_21 is the moment of inertia of the gun about its center of mass, or its pivot point, and formula_22 is the angle of rotation of the barrel axis \"up\" from its orientation at ignition (aim angle). The angular momentum of the gun is found by integrating this equation to obtain:\n\nwhere the equality of the momenta of the gun and bullet have been used. The angular rotation of the gun as the bullet exits the barrel is then found by integrating again:\n\nwhere formula_25 is the angle above the aim angle at which the bullet leaves the barrel, formula_26 is the time of travel of the bullet in the barrel and \"L\" is the distance the bullet travels from its rest position to the tip of the barrel. The angle at which the bullet leaves the barrel above the aim angle is then given by:\n\nThe momentum of the ejected gases will not contribute very much to this result, since the ejected gases have relatively low mass compared to the bullet, and only that portion of gas exiting closely behind the bullet has significantly high velocity to contribute to recoil momentum. However, one should understand that total recoil momentum is slightly more than the simple product of the mass and velocity of the exiting projectile, for this reason.\n\nA consideration of the energy released during the firing of a gun leads to an additional equation useful in recoil analysis. Using Newton's second law, force equals mass times acceleration, the energy within a moving body due to its velocity change caused by that acceleration can be stated mathematically from the translational kinetic energy as:\nwhere:\n\nThis equation is known as the \"classic statement\" and yields a measurement of energy in joules (or foot-pound force in non-SI units). formula_33 is the amount of work (physics), force acting through a distance, that can be done by the recoiling firearm, firearm system, or projectile because of its momentum, and is also called the translational kinetic energy. In the firearms lexicon, the energy of a recoiling firearm can be described as \"felt recoil\", (what the shooter literally feels from the force applied to the shooter's hand, arms and shoulder during the distance the gun recoils to a stop), free recoil, and recoil energy. This same energy equation applies to the projectile exiting the barrel and is called: muzzle energy, bullet energy, remaining energy. Further along on the trajectory, the energy of the projectile at the point of impact is known as the down range energy or impact energy and generally will be slightly smaller than the muzzle energy due to wind resistance slowing the projectile.\n\nAgain assuming free-recoil conditions and assuming all forward momentum is due to the projectile, the energy of the projectile will be formula_34 and the energy of the firearm due to recoil will be formula_35. Since, by Newton's third law, formula_36, it follows that the ratios of the energies is given by:\n\nThe mass of the firearm (formula_38) is generally much greater than the projectile mass (formula_39) which means that most of the kinetic energy produced by the firing of the gun is given to the projectile. (This, of course, is the design intent, to deliver a projectile a great distance forward, as opposed to sending a launcher uselessly rearward). The source of the kinetic energy is the heat energy rapidly released during propellant combustion. Rapidly burning propellant in a sealed container generates tremendous pressure. Pressure is a force applied over an area; in this case the base area of the projectile, driving the projectile down the barrel at high speed. However, whereas momentum is balanced between the projectile and the recoiling firearm, energy is not. Energy of the system is certainly conserved, conservation of energy, but in only the general sense that all the energy in the system, kinetic and potential energy, before the event equals all the energy after the event. That is, some of the potential energy stored in the propellant is released to create kinetic energy in the subsequently moving parts. Some of the propellant energy, by creating high pressure and recoiling forces, briefly deforms the barrel, gun mount, and projectile materials, which heats these materials internally in the process. Additional excess heat energy from the propellant escapes through the muzzle blast as the hot gases exit behind the projectile. All of this heat energy, that does not directly become system kinetic energy, slowly dissipates into the atmosphere as the gun cools. Therefore, whereas momentum between the gun and projectile balances, through conservation of momentum, kinetic energy does not balance between the two. For example, with a rifle weighing 5 pounds firing a 150 grain bullet, at 2840 feet per second, the recoil energy will be only about 0.43 percent of the total kinetic energy developed. The bullet receives about 2685 foot-pounds of energy, and the rifle only 11.5 ft-lbs of energy, even though the rifle and the bullet both receive about 1.89 pound-sec momentum. Given the following calculations:\n\nconvert the bullet and rifle weights to slug (mass)\n\nthe bullet: 150 grains/7000 grains per pound/32.17 ft/sec^2(g) = .000666 slugs\n\nthe rifle: 5 lbs/32.17 = .155 slugs\n\ncalculate the bullet momentum first, as its velocity is easiest to estimate from interior ballistics or directly measure at a firing range:\n\nMomentum (bullet) = mass x velocity = .000666 x 2840 ft/sec = 1.89 pound-second\n\nWorking backwards to find the recoil velocity of the rifle:\n\nMomentum (rifle) = 1.89 = .155 x V(rifle); V(rifle) = 12.2 ft/sec\n\nCalculate bullet and rifle kinetic energy: 1/2 M V^2; 2685 foot-pounds and 11.5 ft-lbs, respectively. Of the total kinetic energy developed (2685 + 11.5), the rifle receives only 0.43%.\n\nUnderstanding where all the energy goes during the combustion process is important to properly designing gun and recoil systems. Recoil energy is initially absorbed by the springs and hydraulic cylinders of the buffering system, or the body of the shooter, which produces the counter-recoil force. The kinetic energy of recoil is then slowly dissipated as heat energy. For a hand-held firearm, the energy is absorbed by the shooter's body, creating a small amount of heat in muscles and bones. For the naval cannon from the figure above, it will roll backwards and the recoil energy will be mostly absorbed by the friction forces in the wheel axles and between the wheel and the ship deck and this energy is again converted to heat.\n\nThe backward momentum applied to the firearm is actually equal and opposite to the momentum of not only the projectile, but the ejected gas created by the combustion of the charge as well. Likewise, the recoil energy given to the firearm is affected by the ejected gas. By conservation of mass, the mass of the ejected gas will be equal to the original mass of the propellant. As a rough approximation, the ejected gas can be considered to have an effective exit velocity of formula_40 where formula_41 is the muzzle velocity of the projectile and formula_42 is approximately constant. The total momentum formula_43 of the propellant and projectile will then be:\n\nwhere: formula_45 is the mass of the propellant charge, equal to the mass of the ejected gas.\n\nThis expression should be substituted into the expression for projectile momentum in order to obtain a more accurate description of the recoil process. The effective velocity may be used in the energy equation as well, but since the value of α used is generally specified for the momentum equation, the energy values obtained may be less accurate. The value of the constant α is generally taken to lie between 1.25 and 1.75. It is mostly dependent upon the type of propellant used, but may depend slightly on other things such as the ratio of the length of the barrel to its radius.\n\nFor small arms, the way in which the shooter perceives the recoil, or \"kick\", can have a significant impact on the shooter's experience and performance. For example, a gun that is said to \"kick like a mule\" is going to be approached with trepidation, and the shooter may anticipate the recoil and flinch in anticipation as the shot is released. This leads to the shooter jerking the trigger, rather than pulling it smoothly, and the jerking motion is almost certain to disturb the alignment of the gun and may result in a miss. The shooter may also be physically injured by firing a weapon generating recoil in excess of what the body can safely absorb or restrain; perhaps getting hit in the eye by the rifle scope, hit in the forehead by a handgun as the elbow bends under the force, or soft tissue damage to the shoulder, wrist and hand; and these results vary for individuals. In addition, as pictured on the right, excessive recoil can create serious range safety concerns, if the shooter cannot adequately restrain the firearm in a down-range direction.\n\nPerception of recoil is related to the deceleration the body provides against a recoiling gun, deceleration being a force that slows the velocity of the recoiling mass. Force applied over a distance is energy. The force that the body feels, therefore, is dissipating the kinetic energy of the recoiling gun mass. A heavier gun, that is a gun with more mass, will manifest lower recoil kinetic energy, and, generally, result in a lessened perception of recoil. Therefore, although determining the recoiling energy that must be dissipated through a counter-recoiling force is arrived at by conservation of momentum, kinetic energy of recoil is what is actually being restrained and dissipated. The ballistics analyst discovers this recoil kinetic energy through analysis of projectile momentum.\n\nOne of the common ways of describing the felt recoil of a particular gun-cartridge combination is as \"soft\" or \"sharp\" recoiling; soft recoil is recoil spread over a longer period of time, that is at a lower deceleration, and sharp recoil is spread over a shorter period of time, that is with a higher deceleration. Like pushing softer or harder on the brakes of a car, the driver feels less or more deceleration force being applied, over a longer or shorter distance to bring the car to a stop. However, for the human body to mechanically adjust recoil time, and hence length, to lessen felt recoil force is perhaps an impossible task. Other than employing less safe and less accurate practices, such as shooting from the hip, shoulder padding is a safe and effective mechanism that allows sharp recoiling to be lengthened into soft recoiling, as lower decelerating force is transmitted into the body over a slightly greater distance and time, and spread out over a slightly larger surface. \n\nKeeping the above in mind, you can generally base the relative recoil of firearms by factoring in a small number of parameters: bullet momentum (weight times velocity), (note that momentum and impulse are interchangeable terms), and the weight of the firearm. Lowering momentum, lowers recoil, all else being the same. Increasing the firearm weight also lowers recoil, again all else being the same. The following are base examples calculated through the Handloads.com free online calculator, and bullet and firearm data from respective reloading manuals (of medium/common loads) and manufacturer specs:\n\n\nIn addition to the overall mass of the gun, reciprocating parts of the gun will affect how the shooter perceives recoil. While these parts are not part of the ejecta, and do not alter the overall momentum of the system, they do involve moving masses during the operation of firing. For example, gas-operated shotguns are widely held to have a \"softer\" recoil than fixed breech or recoil-operated guns. (Although many semi-automatic recoil and gas-operated guns incorporate recoil buffer systems into the stock that effectively spreads out peak felt recoil forces.) In a gas-operated gun, the bolt is accelerated rearwards by propellant gases during firing, which results in a forward force on the body of the gun. This is countered by a rearward force as the bolt reaches the limit of travel and moves forwards, resulting in a zero sum, but to the shooter, the recoil has been spread out over a longer period of time, resulting in the \"softer\" feel.\n\nA recoil system absorbs recoil energy, reducing the peak force that is conveyed to whatever the gun is mounted on. Old-fashioned cannons without a recoil system roll several meters backwards when fired. First was introduced in Russia as Baranovsky gun by Wladimir Baranovsky in 1872 (short recoil operation) and later in France (based on Baranovsky construction) - 75mm field gun of 1897 (long recoil operation). The usual recoil system in modern quick-firing guns is the hydro-pneumatic recoil system. In this system, the barrel is mounted on rails on which it can recoil to the rear, and the recoil is taken up by a cylinder which is similar in operation to an automotive gas-charged shock absorber, and is commonly visible as a cylinder mounted parallel to the barrel of the gun, but shorter and smaller than it. The cylinder contains a charge of compressed air, as well as hydraulic oil; in operation, the barrel's energy is taken up in compressing the air as the barrel recoils backward, then is dissipated via hydraulic damping as the barrel returns forward to the firing position. The recoil impulse is thus spread out over the time in which the barrel is compressing the air, rather than over the much narrower interval of time when the projectile is being fired. This greatly reduces the peak force conveyed to the mount (or to the ground on which the gun has been emplaced).\n\nIn a \"soft-recoil system\", the spring (or air cylinder) that returns the barrel to the forward position starts out in a nearly fully compressed position, then the gun's barrel is released free to fly forward in the moment before firing; the charge is then ignited just as the barrel reaches the fully forward position. Since the barrel is still moving forward when the charge is ignited, about half of the recoil impulse is applied to stopping the forward motion of the barrel, while the other half is, as in the usual system, taken up in recompressing the spring. A latch then catches the barrel and holds it in the starting position. This roughly halves the energy that the spring needs to absorb, and also roughly halves the peak force conveyed to the mount, as compared to the usual system. However, the need to reliably achieve ignition at a single precise instant is a major practical difficulty with this system; and unlike the usual hydro-pneumatic system, soft-recoil systems do not easily deal with hangfires or misfires. One of the early guns to use this system was the French 65 mm mle.1906; it was also used by the World War II British PIAT man-portable anti-tank weapon.\n\nRecoilless rifles and rocket launchers exhaust gas to the rear, balancing the recoil. They are used often as light anti-tank weapons. The Swedish-made Carl Gustav 84mm recoilless gun is such a weapon.\n\nIn machine guns following Hiram Maxim's design - e.g. the Vickers machine gun - the recoil of the barrel is used to drive the feed mechanism.\n\nHollywood and video game depictions of firearm shooting victims being thrown several feet backwards are inaccurate, although not for the often-cited reason of conservation of energy, which would also be in error because conservation of momentum would apply. Although energy (and momentum) must be conserved (in a closed system), this does not mean that the kinetic energy or momentum of the bullet must be fully deposited into the target in a manner that causes it to fly dramatically away. \n\nFor example, a bullet fired from an M16 rifle has approximately 1763 Joules of kinetic energy as it leaves the muzzle, but the recoil energy of the gun is less than 7 Joules. Despite this imbalance, energy is still conserved because the total energy in the system before firing (the chemical energy stored in the propellant) is equal to the total energy after firing (the kinetic energy of the recoiling firearm, plus the kinetic energy of the bullet and other ejecta, plus the heat energy from the explosion). In order to work out the distribution of kinetic energy between the firearm and the bullet, it is necessary to use the law of conservation of momentum in combination with the law of conservation of energy.\n\nThe same reasoning applies when the bullet strikes a target. The bullet may have a kinetic energy in the hundreds or even thousands of joules, which in theory is enough to lift a person well off the ground. This energy, however, cannot be efficiently given to the target, because total momentum must be conserved, too. Approximately, the fraction of energy transferred to the target (energy transferred to the target divided by the total kinetic energy of the bullet) cannot be larger than the inverse of the ratio of the masses of the target and the bullet itself.\n\nThe rest of the bullet's kinetic energy is spent in the deformation or shattering of the bullet (depending on bullet construction), damage to the target (depending on target construction), and heat dissipation. In other words, because the bullet strike on the target is an inelastic collision, only a minority of the bullet energy is used to actually impart momentum to the target. This is why a ballistic pendulum relies on conservation of bullet momentum and pendulum energy rather than conservation of bullet energy to determine bullet velocity; a bullet fired into a hanging block of wood or other material will spend much of its kinetic energy to create a hole in the wood and dissipate heat as friction as it slows to a stop.\n\nGunshot victims frequently (but not always) simply collapse when shot, which is usually due to psychological expectation when hit, a direct hit to the central nervous system, or rapid blood pressure drop causing immediate unconsciousness (see stopping power), or the bullet shatters a leg bone, and not the result of the momentum of the bullet pushing them over.\n\n\n"}

They are essentially virtual master objects that can, at various times, have physical incarnations of themselves. An object can be considered a spime when all of its essential information is stored in the cloud. Bruce Sterling sees spimes as coming through the convergence of six emerging technologies, related to both the manufacturing process for consumer goods, and through identification and location technologies. Depending on context, the term \"spime\" can refer to both—the archetype, as designed by the developer, or a user-specific instance of it.\n\nThe term spime was coined for this concept by author Bruce Sterling. It is a contraction of “space” and “time” which derives from his thought of a spime being an “object precisely localized in time and space [...] always associated with a history.” The term was probably first used in a large public forum by Sterling at SIGGRAPH Los Angeles, August 2004. The idea was further expanded upon in his book Shaping Things. Since, the use of the term by researchers and in industry has grown.\n\nThe six facets of spimes are:\n\n\nWith all six of these, one could track the entire existence of an object, from before it was made (its virtual representation), through its manufacture, its ownership history, its physical location, until its eventual obsolescence and breaking-down back into raw material to be used for new instantiations of objects. If recorded, the lifetime of the object can be archived and queried.\n\nSpimes are not defined merely by these six technologies; rather, if these technologies converge within the manufacturing process then spimes could indeed arise. Due to physical limitations and cost-effectiveness, objects that perform similar functions to a spime but exist in a heterogeneous ecosystem where some of their spime-like functionality is performed by and/or shared with other entities may be precursors to spimes. For example, integrating a GPS receiver into every object is currently impractical because of size, power, and cost, among other reasons, but a base station that provides location services for one or many nearby devices may be more practical. \n\n\n\n\n"}
