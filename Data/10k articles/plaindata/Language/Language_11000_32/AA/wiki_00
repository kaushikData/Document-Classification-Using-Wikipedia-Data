Souren went to Bamako and met people at a community center. He paid each person willing to write an article $1 U.S. The authors had no internet connections and no Wikipedia usernames. They wrote articles in Microsoft Word and gave the files to Souren. Souren uploaded each article and credited the authors. Souren wrote \"I can’t understand 100 percent of what they wrote, but I could estimate that it was right.

Noam Cohen of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"Most of the people who have heard about Mr. Souren’s decision to pay for entries lauded his goal but questioned his tactics, saying that they undercut the Wikipedia spirit, and that, ultimately, a Bambara Wikipedia would work only if there was a voluntary community to support it.\" This project resulted in the partial translation of the interfaces of the Bambara and Fula Wikipedias and the creation of some articles for those Wikipedias.

{"id": "3317481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3317481", "title": "Christmas creep", "text": "Christmas creep\n\nChristmas creep is a merchandising phenomenon in which merchants and retailers introduce Christmas-themed merchandise or decorations before the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, which in the United States is on the day after Thanksgiving. The term was first used in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe phenomenon is associated with a desire of merchants to take advantage of particularly heavy Christmas-related shopping well before Black Friday in the United States and before Halloween in Canada. The term ‘Black Friday’ was not used until recently in the UK and Ireland. The increased usage can be traced to the internet being more widespread, as well as growing Americanization, as neither country celebrates Thanksgiving. Previously, retailers referred to Christmas as the \"golden quarter\", that is, the three months of October through December is the quarter of the year in which the retail industry hopes to make the most profit. The lack of Thanksgiving as a ‘barrier’ between holidays has caused several retailers to put up Christmas sales earlier in the year. For instance, Irish retailer Brown Thomas opens its Christmas store in mid-August.\nThis phenomenon can apply for other holidays as well, notably Valentine's Day, Easter and Mother's Day. The motivation for holiday creep is for retailers to lengthen their selling interval for seasonal merchandise in order to maximize profit and to give early-bird shoppers a head start on that holiday. However, it is not clear that this practice has been consistently beneficial for retailers.\n\nSeasonal creep is not limited to the northern hemisphere winter holiday season and other popular holidays and observances, but is also becoming more common for merchandise associated with a general season of the year. Advertising for winter-, spring-, summer-, and fall-related goods generally now begins midway through the previous season. For example, many supermarkets in the United Kingdom begin selling Easter eggs even before Christmas, and in the US, stores begin selling 4th of July products before Easter, and the next major holiday is marketed as soon as or before the previous has ended. Such a phenomenon is known under the more general name of holiday creep.\n\nIn Australia, shops have been known to have their Christmas merchandise available as early as late September, mainly because older Australians generally don't celebrate Halloween compared to younger Australians, though by the 2010s, Halloween merchandise has cropped up alongside Christmas merchandise during the same periods. The department store, David Jones Limited even begins selling Christmas merchandise at the start of September.\n\nIn United States retail, the phenomenon was pioneered by stores like Sam's Club, which introduced early Christmas sales to support resellers. The hardware chain Lowe's followed in 2000 with a policy of setting out Christmas trees and decorations by October 1, mainly because the Halloween and Thanksgiving holidays do not provide enough merchandise or sales to fill retail space between the end of the summer season and the Christmas season. In 2002–2003, Christmas creep accelerated markedly with retailers such as Walmart, J. C. Penney, and Target beginning their Christmas sales in October. In 2006 the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, said that 40 percent of consumers planned to start their holiday shopping before Halloween. Since the 2010s, there has been a growing trend for retailers to start selling holiday merchandise in mid- to late-September, with retailers such as Walmart, Sam's Club, Kmart, Costco, J.C. Penney, Sears, and Lowe's now beginning their Christmas sales earlier than October 1.\n\nChristmas creep has also been cited as a phenomenon in radio broadcasting. Prior to the early 21st century, radio stations commonly began adding some Christmas songs to their regular playlists in early December and then playing an all-Christmas playlist on December 24 and 25. In 2000 some stations began playing an exclusively Christmas format for the entire month of December, a practice that became more widespread in 2001. In subsequent years, such stations have commonly shifted to an all-Christmas playlist after Thanksgiving, or even several weeks earlier. A handful of American radio stations have, since 2006, earned a reputation for regularly switching to Christmas music on November 1, the day after Halloween; as of 2011, this has not become the norm for most of North America (mid-November is the typical start time for Christmas music on most radio stations in the United States and Canada), and it is still extremely rare to hear stations (other than those pulling a stunt between changing formats) change to Christmas music in October.\n\nSome of the channels on the cable radio service Music Choice begin playing Christmas music continually from the end of Halloween up until the first week of January (with the Internet age, the network maintains an exclusive Christmas music channel through some providers and their TV Everywhere platform year-round). Likewise, the U.S. cable channel Hallmark Channel begins airing continuous Christmas movies through the whole months of November and December and since 2018, Freeform airs Christmas movies from November 1 to December 25.\n\nAlthough not often broadcast in the summer, the animated special \"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July\" is based on the concept and set in July.\n\nThis market trend is satirized in the 1974 animated special \"It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown\", when the characters go shopping at a department store and discover that it has its Christmas displays up in the middle of April, including a sign forewarning that there were only a mere 246 days left until Christmas. Additionally, in 1973's \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\", Sally complains that she was looking for a turkey tree for Thanksgiving but had only found Christmas supplies.\n\nSeveral songs satirize the phenomenon, including Loudon Wainwright III's \"Suddenly It's Christmas\" (from his 1993 live album \"Career Moves\"), Straight No Chaser's \"The Christmas Can-Can\" (from their 2009 album \"Christmas Cheers\"), Paul and Storm's \"The Way-Too-Early Christmas Song\" (from their 2010 album \"Do You Like Star Wars?\"). Christian singer/songwriter Brandon Heath voiced his feelings on Christmas creep in the song \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" (from his 2013 album \"Christmas Is Here\").\n\nIn Jim Butcher's 2012 novel \"Cold Days\", Santa Claus himself declares that he's drawing the line at Halloween.\n\n\n"}

A mere forty years later, in 1879, Volapük took English for basis. Second, Schipfer's project reflects a new conscience of greater possibilities of the international communication which appeared by the invention of the railway and steam ship. He even recommended that his project be used on these \"new means of voyage\".\n\nCommunicationssprache is based on (or a simplification of) French (See French orthography), making heavy (even exclusive) use of respelled French vocabulary, which Schipfer considered to be nearly universal among the educated classes of the world of his time. Silent letters were removed, one sound for one letter, circumflexes and diaereses were removed, graves to distinguish homographs were removed, the letter w was added (as in English), vowels \"e\" instead of \"é\", \"ä\" instead of French \"è\", \"ö\" instead of French \"œ\", \"u\" instead of French \"ou\", \"ü\" instead of French \"u\", \"oa\" instead of French \"oi\", the inclusion of macrons for long vowels, and one sound per letter. Although the final orthography can be read and spelled easily due to this one-sound-per-letter principle, the actual conversion of French words is inconsistent, being based sometimes on pronunciation and sometimes on orthography, for example word-final silent <c> is deleted, as in Estoma \"stomach\" < éstomac, but silent <h> is kept, as in Homa \"man\" < homme.\n\nSome of its characteristics are:\n\n\nThe declension of nouns works as follows, using Masona \"house\" as an example:\n\n\nPater Noster:\n\nNumbers from one to ten:\nA Response to a Dear Friend\n\n\"Communicationssprache\": Cher Amia!

In the 1910-1920s she enjoyed some popularity as a novelist; currently her literary contribution is considered of very little value. Over decades she contributed to some 40 periodicals and launched a short-lived feminine review on her own. Briefly engaged in setting up schools for the middle- and low-class girls, later she remained active advocating the presence of females in public life, especially in culture and education. Politically she sided with the Carlists, for decades contributing to their periodicals. All her activities were flavored with zealous Catholicism.\n\nHer father, Carlos Gortázar y Campillo, was member of the urban middle-class. The Gortázar family is one of the oldest ones in Spain, its first representatives noted in the 12th century as related to Vizcaya. Over centuries the Gortázars held various civil and religious posts in Biscay, Alava and Cantabria; the family became very branched and scattered across the North of Spain, some branches renamed to Cortázar. It is not clear which branch the Dolores ascendants belonged to, apart that they were linked to Santander and Biscay. Her father joined the press corps, working as reporter and journalist; in the late 1850s and early 1860s he contributed from La Habana, later settling in León. It is there he married a local girl, Juliana Serantes y de Cadórniga (died 1916), descendant to a Leonese family distinguished especially along her maternal line.\n\nThe marriage settled in León; it is not clear how many children they had, though it is likely that Dolores was the only one. She frequented the Carmelitan college in her native city and from childhood demonstrated a talent for letters. Her 1882 poem, dedicated to Jesus, was published in local press; her 1884 comedy was played at the Carmelitan theatre in León; her religious polemics was also acknowledged in print.\n\nIn 1888 she got married; none of the sources consulted offers any information on motives for such an early decision. The groom was Fernando Valcárcel Saavedra Fajardo Ladrón de Guevara (1865-1895), descendant to a noble Levantine family; the couple settled in Mula. Valcárcel was soon diagnosed with mental disorder and in 1892 he was placed in a psychiatric hospital, where he passed away in 1895. Dolores’ only child, Carolina, was born either posthumously or shortly before Valcárcel’s death.\n\nDolores returned to León; with her father already defunct, she joined her mother in the native city; she resumed education, training to be a teacher. In 1899 she completed the curriculum in León, becoming Maestra Superior; in 1903 she reportedly became Maestra Normal in Burgos, though her title was later questioned. She referred to herself as \"doctora in filosofia y letras\", yet it is not known whether, when and where she graduated.\n\nIn 1910 Dolores remarried with a Madrid lawyer and Catholic writer Francisco Pol. The groom either passed away shortly or the couple separated, as the last information on the marriage comes from 1911; Dolores’ personal life is vaguely described as \"larga serie de calamidades\". The last of these calamities was the premature 1936 death of Carolina; Dolores passed away two months after her daughter. At that point she had 5 grandchildren, born since 1918; none of them grew to prominence.\n\nGortázar wrote poetic pieces throughout all of her life. They are scattered across various periodicals from the 1890s to the 1930s, sometimes featured on front pages; the only major volume she published was \"Nimias\" (1898). Her poetry keeps revolving around Christian virtues, advantages of family life, beauty of Spain and patriotic values; fairly conventional if not banal in terms of style, in terms of content it advances the praise of traditional orthodoxy, even if at times flavored with some melancholy. One more literary genre she followed was drama; she is known to have written two one-act comedies featuring \"tipos y costumbres leonesas\", played in León and perhaps also in Madrid. \n\nIn terms of public and scholarly recognition Gortázar was first noticed as a translator; her Spanish \"El arte poética\" (1901) version of Horace’s \"Ars poëtica\" won awards at the León Juegos Florales and was acknowledged with praise by Real Academia Española. She tried her hand in historiography, especially in paleography; entrusted with specific tasks by Real Academia de la Historia, she published two studies on San Miguel de Escalada (1899) and the Valvanera monastery (1907). Other historiographic works were a mid-size biographical study on St. Frances of Rome (1911) and a piece on Incarnation (1902).\nIn literature Gortázar obtained her biggest success as a novelist, the author of \"El Cristo de la roca\" (1911) and \"La roca del amor\" (1924). Both are in fact one and the same novel, the latter slightly re-edited to provide a sense of novelty; the disguise proved successful, as in contemporary press \"La roca\" was acknowledged as original. The novel is a love story, vaguely set in a milieu of Valencian aristocracy; it features a complex family intrigue. The plot is about overcoming a series of mysterious tragedies and misfortunes; Christian backbone of the protagonists, one of them a Catholic priest, enabled them to succeed. Falling into the typical genre fiction of the era, \"El Cristo\" / \"La roca\" is perhaps most interesting due to its narrative technique, as the story is made of different recollective accounts. Other Gortázar’s prosaic attempts, a shorter novel and a collection of stories, were far less successful. \n\nFor some 40 years Gortázar contributed to numerous press titles; according to one source she published in some 35 periodicals in Spain and in America. Only some of them can be identified; the ones to be named due to her longtime collaboration are local dailies \"El Porvenir\" (León) and \"El Diario de Zamora\", Carlist periodicals \"\" and \"\", and women’s reviews like \"Gloria Femenina\". The title which stands out is \"Roma\", her own initiative formatted as one of the first Spanish feminine reviews and issued in 1912-1914. Gortázar’s contributions are mostly poems, travel correspondence. short stories, pieces on literature, arts, culture and education, all invariably formatted along Catholic lines and generally steering clear of controversial topics. As she usually published under various pen-names the scale of her production is yet to be assessed, though it was probably massive.\n\nIn course of the usual contest, in 1902 Gortázar emerged successful and commenced teaching in an unidentified Madrid state college. The same year she floated an idea of setting up a school for poor and handicapped children in Madrid, the concept which in 1904 was somewhat re-formatted to a high-quality state school for girls from middle class, daughters of \"viudas, empleados, familias de militares y á veces la nobleza hundida\". Already at that time the queen-mother Maria Christina was envisioned as a noble patron of the enterprise. In 1905 the project took shape of Centro Nacional de Instrucción de María Cristina, with Gortázar as its directora; she supervised preparation works, which in 1906 led to opening of Escuela María Cristina, in some sources referred to as Real Colegio de María Cristina. The establishment, apparently financed by private sponsors, was hailed in the press as state-of-the-art school; initially it admitted only 19 girls. Its curriculum was fairly standard, though it was allegedly the first one to include cooking lessons.\n\nThough in 1907 Gortázar was still the headmaster, in 1908 and in unclear circumstances she left the establishment and returned to León. The same year she was appointed profesora provisional of Escuela Normal de Maestras in her native city, entering also the jury of Universidad de Oviedo, a body supervising the college opposiciones. In 1909 she was nominated profesora provisional in Escuela Normal de Maestras in Soria, yet her career was rather short. In 1910 she was charged with abuse of power and sacked. The issue is not entirely clear; in private letters Gortázar claimed her problems resulted from the ministry changing formal requirements. The episode seems to have terminated Gortázar’s teaching career, though she was later reported as engaged in opening schools for the working class in Covadonga in 1914 and in Madrid in 1918.\n\nSince the 1910s Gortázar was engaged in countless organizations marked by their feminine, Catholic, educational and at times social character. In 1910 she was co-founder of Fundación San Francisco de Paula, in the mid-1910s headed Acción Social Católica Feminista, known also as Acción Social Católica de la Mujer Española, in the late 1910s acted in La Mujer Católica, since the early 1920s campaigned for hygiene and sanity, in 1927 co-launched Cruzada de Buenas Lecturas and as its president remained active in the organization until the early 1930s, in 1931 co-founded Club Feminista and was president of Sociedad Femenina Aspiraciones, while in 1932 she became president of Agrupación Femenina Paz Social. On top of this she contributed to feminine press, kept giving lectures on cultural topics, took part in various veladas culturales and was member of . Over time her engagements assumed somewhat non-traditional tone; in 1931-1933 she campaigned for female suffrage.\n\nGortázar’s father was a Liberal, active republican and friend of Castelar. It is not clear how the young Dolores developed Traditionalist sympathies; in the 1890s she was already a declared Carlist. Initially her activity was about organizing prayers and donations for the Spanish army fighting in Cuba, yet already in 1899 she engaged in veladas artisticas of the León círculo carlista. Successful proselytizing in private she took up propaganda works also in public, commencing cooperation with the semi-official Carlist mouthpiece, \"El Correo Español\". In 1900 rumored even to launch her own Traditionalist daily, at that time she was already known as \"ilustre dama carlista\".\n\nHer translation of Horace was acknowledged in a 1902 congratulation letter from the Carlist heir to the throne, Don Jaime, two years her senior; since the prince has never developed particular interest in letters and it does not seem that the two had met before, the expression of sympathy remains somewhat mysterious. For the time being her Carlist zeal cooled down. During the Madrid schooling episode she seemed on perfect terms with the Alfonsist royal family and in the 1910s she published in Maurista and national-Catholic press. However, Gortázar retained her Carlist link, together with the party pundits sporadically giving lectures at Traditionalism-flavored events.\n\nThe climax of her Carlist activity fell on the years following the Mellista secession. In a huge 1919 front-page \"El Correo Español\" article she hailed Cid-style loyalty to the king as a genuine virtue; in 1920 she was listed active on numerous Jaimista meetings; in 1921 she became president of the Madrid Margaritas, the Carlist feminine organization. The same year she took part in Junta de Lourdes, a grand Carlist assembly supposed to set a new political direction; immediately afterwards she published \"La Regeneración de España\", a pamphlet assailing Mellismo and applauding the Lourdes program. During some of the 1922 meetings she was seated next to the Jaimista leader, marqués de Villores.\n\nCollapse of \"El Correo Español\" deprived Gortázar of her key press tribune and advent of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship brought political life to a standstill. She switched to other conservative periodicals, proudly boasting her friendship with Don Jaime, hailing him as \"nuestro caudillo\" and at times taking part in Traditionalism-flavored events. In the late 1920s she commenced close collaboration with a new Carlist weekly from Madrid, \"El Cruzado Español\", hoping to convert it into a daily. At that time she was also awarded Ordén de la Legitimidad Proscrita, a high Carlist honor. During late primoderiverismo and dictablanda she resumed more active stand, opening círculos, featuring in headlines and presiding over the Madrid Margaritas, mobilizing against \"grandes privilegios a las mujeres rojas\", especially after declaration of the Republic. In course of its first years she remained active in the Carlist realm, though rather in the second if not the third row: Gortázar contributed to \"Cruzado\", presided over some meetings, opened new círculos, and gave lectures. Since 1933 she was honorary president of the Madrid círculo; in 1935 she contributed to electoral mobilization.\n\nIn 1901 Gortázar won her first awards with \"Ars Poetica\" appreciated at the León Juegos Florales and by the Academy; in public discourse the work earned her the prestige of \"distinguida latinista\". Her dramas were recognized only locally in León; her poetry went largely unnoticed, though in one case it was acknowledged as \"escritas con soltura y buen gusto\". Her only literary work which gained nationwide recognition and became sort of a bestseller was \"El Cristo de la Roca\", published in 3 editions and followed by the next 2 under the title of \"El roca del amor\". In contemporary press she was referred to as \"insigne literata\", \"distinguida escritora\" \"conocida escritora\", \"insigne escritora\", \"laureada escritora\", \"unas de las más galanas plumas de nuestra floreciente literatura\", \"dama de gran cultura\", \"novelista de empuje y de maestría\", \"gran novelista\", \"eminente poetisa\", \"insigne poetisa\" and \"inspirada poetisa\". Most of the above seem marketing slogans rather than opinion of informed critics, though Gortázar is known to have exchanged a friendly correspondence with Marcelino Menendez Pelayo and to have collaborated with .\n\nIn more detailed reviews her novels were appreciated for educational and human values, adhering to \"profoundly Catholic\" moral standards, much needed in time of false idols and \"libros insulsos o criminales\". In terms of literary value, they were noted for suggestive, graceful, elegant, natural style, flesh-and-blood personalities, social observations and in-depth psychological background, but especially for lively narration and interesting plot, allegedly corresponding to \"historial de su autora\"; all that rendered the work \"highly recommended\". The anti-clerical \"\" also recommended the novel, having found in it a criticism of conventual education, which ensures luxury of religious establishment and pushes the secular one into poverty. One newspaper claimed that a US company intended to buy a copyright and produce a movie.\n\nIn history of literature Gortázar was initially treated very briefly, acknowledged by in the 1920s; in 1925 she also featured in \"Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana\". Afterwards she fell into oblivion, barely mentioned in single works covering specific topics, not necessarily related to literature. None of the present-day numerous encyclopedias, dictionaries or synthetic works on Spanish literature mentions her name; even volumes dedicated to modern Spanish feminine poetry or to popular Spanish novel do not consider her worth noting. She earned biographical entries in two studies, perhaps due to her sex rather than because of the quality of her writings, and was twice dedicated articles in the Leonese press, named \"principal escritora leonesa de su tiempo\". In scholarly realm she is noted in historiography rather than literature, as her paleographic studies are at times quoted in nowadays works. The school she co-founded and directed in 1906-1908 is active until today as Real Centro Universitario María Cristina, though the institution does not mention her on its web page. In the Carlist realm she is entirely forgotten.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2957537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2957537", "title": "Dream telepathy", "text": "Dream telepathy\n\nDream telepathy is the purported ability to communicate telepathically with another person while one is dreaming. The first person in modern times to document telepathic dreaming was Sigmund Freud. In the 1940s it was the subject of the Eisenbud-Pederson-Krag-Fodor-Ellis controversy, named after the preeminent psychoanalysts of the time who were involved Jule Eisenbud, Geraldine Pederson-Krag, Nandor Fodor, and Albert Ellis. There is no scientific evidence that dream telepathy is a real phenomenon. Parapsychological experiments into dream telepathy have not produced replicable results.\n\nThe notion and speculation of communication via dreaming was first mooted in psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud in 1921. He produced a model to express his ideas about telepathic dreaming. His 1922 paper \"Dreams and Telepathy\" is reproduced in the book \"Psychoanalysis and the Occult\" (1953) and was intended to be a lecture to the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society, although he never delivered it. Freud considered that a connection between telepathy and dreams could be neither proven nor disproven. He was distinctly suspicious of the whole idea, noting that he himself had never had a telepathic dream. (His two dreams that were potentially telepathic, where he dreamed of the deaths of a son and of a sister-in-law, which did not occur, he labeled as \"purely subjective anticipations\".) His ideas were not widely accepted at the time, but he continued to publicly express his interest and findings about telepathic dreaming. He also observed that he had not encountered any evidence of dream telepathy in his patients. Freud claims neutrality about the phenomenon itself, states that the sleep milieu has special likely properties for it if it does exist, and discounts all of the cases presented to him on standard psychoanalytic grounds (e.g. neurosis, transference, etc.).\n\nIn the 1940s Jule Eisenbud, Geraldine Pederson-Krag and Nandor Fodor described alleged cases of dream telepathy. Albert Ellis regarded their conclusions to have been based upon flimsy evidence, and that they could be better explained by bias, coincidence and unconscious cues than by dream telepathy. He also accused them of an emotional involvement in the notion, resulting in their observations and judgement being clouded. Psychologist L. Börje Löfgren also criticised dream telepathy experiments of Eisenbud. He stated that coincidence was a more likely explanation and the \"assumption of paranormal forces to explain them is unnecessary.\"\n\nThere have been many experiments done to test the validity of dream telepathy and its effectiveness, but with significant issues of blinding. Many test subjects find ways to communicate with others to make it look like telepathic communication. Attempts to cut off communication between the agent, sender, and receiver of information failed because subjects found ways to get around blindfolds no matter how intricate and covering they were. In studies at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York led by Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman, patients were monitored and awakened after a period of REM then separated to study the claimed ability to communicate telepathically. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy.\n\nThe picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed; however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.\n\nAn attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level. Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.\n\nIn 2003, Simon Sherwood and Chris Roe wrote a review that claimed support for dream telepathy at Maimonides. However, James Alcock noted that their review was based on \"extreme messiness\" of data. Alcock concluded the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and \"lack of replication is rampant.\"\n\nThe psychologist and noted skeptic Richard Wiseman took part in a dream telepathy experiment. It was conducted by Caroline Watt at a sleep laboratory in an attempt to replicate the results of Krippner and Ullman. The experiment was a complete failure. According to Wiseman \"after monitoring about twenty volunteers for several nights on end, the study didn't discover any evidence in support of the supernatural.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11273", "title": "Faroese language", "text": "Faroese language\n\nFaroese (; , ) is a North Germanic language spoken as a first language by about 72,000 people, 51,000 of whom reside on the Faroe Islands and 21,000 in other areas, mainly Denmark. It is one of five languages descended from Old West Norse spoken in the Middle Ages, the others being Norwegian, Icelandic, and the extinct Norn and Greenlandic Norse. Faroese and Icelandic, its closest extant relative, are not mutually intelligible in speech, but the written languages resemble each other quite closely, largely owing to Faroese's etymological orthography.\n\nAround 900, the language spoken in the Faroes was Old Norse, which Norse settlers had brought with them during the time of the settlement of Faroe Islands (\"landnám\") that began in 825. However, many of the settlers were not from Scandinavia, but descendants of Norse settlers in the Irish Sea region. In addition, women from Norse Ireland, Orkney, or Shetland often married native Scandinavian men before settling in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. As a result, the Irish language has had some influence on both Faroese and Icelandic. There is some debatable evidence of Irish language place names in the Faroes: for example, the names of Mykines, Stóra Dímun, Lítla Dímun and Argir have been hypothesized to contain Celtic roots. Other examples of early-introduced words of Celtic origin are: \"blak/blaðak\" (buttermilk), cf. Middle Irish \"bláthach\"; \"drunnur\" (tail-piece of an animal), cf. Middle Irish \"dronn\"; \"grúkur\" (head, headhair), cf. Middle Irish \"gruaig\"; \"lámur\" (hand, paw), cf. Middle Irish \"lámh\"; \"tarvur\" (bull), cf. Middle Irish \"tarbh\"; and \"ærgi\" (pasture in the outfield), cf. Middle Irish \"áirge\".\n\nBetween the 9th and the 15th centuries, a distinct Faroese language evolved, although it was probably still mutually intelligible with Old West Norse, and remained similar to the Norn language of Orkney and Shetland during Norn's earlier phase.\n\nFaroese ceased to be a written language after the union of Norway with Denmark in 1380, with Danish replacing Faroese as the language of administration and education. The islanders continued to use the language in ballads, folktales, and everyday life. This maintained a rich spoken tradition, but for 300 years the language was not used in written form.\n\nIn 1823 the Danish Bible Society published a diglot of the Gospel of Matthew, with Faroese on the left and Danish on the right.\n\nVenceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb and the Icelandic grammarian and politician Jón Sigurðsson published a written standard for Modern Faroese in 1854, which still exists. They set a standard for the orthography of the language, based on its Old Norse roots and similar to that of Icelandic. This had the advantage of being etymologically clear, as well as keeping the kinship with the Icelandic written language. The actual pronunciation, however, often differs from the written rendering. The letter ð, for example, has no specific phoneme attached to it.\n\nJakob Jakobsen devised a rival system of orthography, based on his wish for a phonetic spelling, but this system was never taken up by the speakers.\n\nIn 1908 Scripture Gift Mission published the Gospel of John in Faroese.\n\nIn 1937, Faroese replaced Danish as the official school language, in 1938 as the church language, and in 1948 as the national language by the Home Rule Act of the Faroes. However, Faroese did not become the common language of media and advertising until the 1980s. Today Danish is considered a foreign language, although around 5% of residents on the Faroes learn it as a first language, and it is a required subject for students in third grade and up.\n\nThe Visit Faroese tourism organisation launched the Faroe Islands Translate online service in 2017, available in English and another 13 languages including Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and Portuguese. A Faroese video database has also been built.\n\nOld Faroese (\"miðaldarføroyskt\", ca. mid-14th to mid-16th centuries) is a form of Old Norse spoken in medieval times in the Faroe Islands. The language shares many features with both Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian; Old Norwegian appears closer to Old Faroese, whereas Old Icelandic remained rather archaic compared to other medieval varieties of Old West Norse. The most crucial aspects of the development of Faroese are diphthongisation and palatalisation.\n\nThere is not enough data available to establish an accurate chronology of Faroese, but a rough one may be developed through comparison to the chronologies of Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian. In the 12th/13th centuries, \"á\" and \"ǫ́\" merged as ; later on at the beginning of the 14th century, delabialization took place: \"y\", \"øy\", \"au\" > /i, ɔi, ɛi/; \"í\" and \"ý\" merged in addition to \"i\" and \"y\", but in the case of \"í\" and \"ý\", it appears that labialisation took place instead as is documented by later development to . Further, the language underwent a palatalisation of \"k\", \"g\" and \"sk\" before Old Norse \"e\", \"i\", \"y\", \"ø\", \"au\" > > > . Before the palatalisation \"é\" and \"ǽ\" merged as and approximately in the same period epenthetic \"u\" is inserted into word-final and clusters. The Great Quantity Shift operated in the 15th/16th centuries. In the case of \"skerping\", it took place after delabialization but before loss of post-vocalic \"ð\" and \"g\" . The shift of \"hv\" to , the deletion of in (remaining) word-initial –sonorant clusters (\"hr\", \"hl\", \"hn\" > \"r\", \"l\", \"n\"), and the dissolution of \"þ\" (\"þ\" > \"t\"; \"þ\" > \"h\" in demonstrative pronouns and adverbs) appeared before the end of the 13th century. Another undated change is the merger of \"ǫ\", \"ø\" and \"ǿ\" into ; pre-nasal \"ǫ\", \"ǫ́\" > \"o\", \"ó\". \"enk\", \"eng\" probably became \"eing\", \"eink\" in the 14th century; the development of \"a\" to before \"ng\", \"nk\" appeared after the palatalisation of \"k\", \"g\", and \"sk\" had been completed, such a change is quite a recent development, as well as change \"Cve\" > \"Cvø\".\n\nThe Faroese alphabet consists of 29 letters derived from the Latin script:\n\nAs with most other Germanic languages, Faroese has a large number of vowels, with 26 in total. Vowel distribution is similar to other North Germanic languages in that short vowels appear in closed syllables (those ending in consonant clusters or long consonants) and long vowels appearing in open syllables. provides the following alternations:\n\nFaroese shares with Icelandic and Danish the feature of maintaining a contrast between stops based exclusively on aspiration, not voicing. Geminated stops may be pre-aspirated in intervocalic and word-final position. Intervocalically the aspirated consonants become pre-aspirated unless followed by a closed vowel. In clusters, the preaspiration merges with a preceding nasal or apical approximant, rendering them voiceless.\n\nThere are several phonological processes involved in Faroese, including:\n\nFaroese grammar is related and very similar to that of modern Icelandic and Old Norse. Faroese is an inflected language with three grammatical genders and four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A fugitive from justice, also known as a wanted person, can be a person who is either convicted or accused of a crime and hiding from law enforcement in the state or taking refuge in a different country in order to avoid arrest.\n\nA fugitive from justice alternatively has been defined as a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control of the national or sub-national government or international criminal tribunal with an interest in his or her arrest. This latter definition adopts the perspective of the pursuing government or tribunal, recognizing that the charged (versus escaped) individual does not necessarily realize that they are officially a wanted person (e.g., due to a case of mistaken identity or reliance on a sealed indictment), and therefore may not be fleeing, hiding, or taking refuge to avoid arrest. The fugitive from justice is ‘international’ (versus ‘domestic’) if wanted by law enforcement authorities across a national border.\n\nInterpol is the international organization with no legal authority to directly pursue or detain fugitives of any kind. Europol is the European authority for the pursuit of fugitives who are on the run within Europe, and coordinates their search, while national authorities in the probable country of their stay coordinate their arrest. In the United States, the U.S. Marshals Service is the primary law enforcement agency that tracks down federal fugitives, though the Federal Bureau of Investigation also tracks fugitives.\n\nAs a verbal metaphor and psychological concept, one might also be described as a \"fugitive from oneself\". Finally, the literary sense of \"fugitive\" includes the meaning of simply \"fleeing\".\nIn many jurisdictions, a fugitive who flees custody while a trial is underway loses the right to appeal any convictions or sentences imposed on him, since the act of fleeing is deemed to flout the court's authority. Recently, convicted rapist Andrew Luster had his appeals denied on the basis that he spent six months as a fugitive (he was convicted \"in absentia\").\n\nWhile a person is being sought for potential arrest, the person may be described variously as being \"at large\" or as a \"person of interest\" to law enforcement. The latter term is frequently used in an \"All-points bulletin\" issued to other law enforcement persons or agencies. A person who has jumped bail after arraignment in court may be hunted or pursued by his bail bondsman, and a bounty may be \"on his head.\" The act of fleeing from the jurisdiction of a court is described colloquially as \"fleeing justice\" or \"running from the Law.\" A \"wanted poster\" may be issued, especially by the FBI, culminating in the \"FBI's Most Wanted List\" of fugitives.\n\n\"On the lam\" or \"on the run\" often refers to fugitives. Mencken's \"The American Language\" and \"The Thesaurus of American Slang\" proclaim that lam, lamister, and \"on the lam\"—all referring to a hasty departure—were common in thieves' slang before the turn of the 20th century. Mencken quotes a newspaper report on the origin of 'lam' which actually traces it indirectly back to Shakespeare's time.\n\nMencken also quotes a story from the \"New York Herald Tribune\" newspaper in 1938 which reported that \"one of the oldest police officers in New York said that he had heard 'on the lam' thirty years ago.\"\n\nVarious methods can be used to find fugitives. Phone taps and pen registers can be used on relatives. Credit card and cell phone activities and electronic transfer of money can also be traced. Wanted posters and rewards can also be used. Jail records are also sometimes used; for instance, after the U.S. Government determined that Timothy McVeigh had perpetrated the Oklahoma City Bombing, he was found in a local jail.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11709017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11709017", "title": "Global language system", "text": "Global language system\n\nThe global language system is the \"ingenious pattern of connections between language groups\". Dutch sociologist Abram de Swaan developed this theory in 2001 in his book \"Words of the World: The Global Language System\" and according to him, \"the multilingual connections between language groups do not occur haphazardly, but, on the contrary, they constitute a surprisingly strong and efficient network that ties together – directly or indirectly – the six billion inhabitants of the earth.\" The global language system draws upon the world system theory to account for the relationships between the world's languages and divides them into a hierarchy consisting of four levels, namely the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages.\n\nAccording to de Swaan, the global language system has been constantly evolving since the time period of the early 'military-agrarian' regimes. Under these regimes, the rulers imposed their own language and so the first 'central' languages emerged, linking the peripheral languages of the agrarian communities via bilingual speakers to the language of the conquerors. Then was the formation of empires, which resulted in the next stage of integration of the world language system.\n\nFirstly, Latin emerged from Rome. Under the rule of the Roman Empire, under which an extensive group of states were ruled by, the usage of Latin stretched along the Mediterranean coast, the southern half of Europe, and more sparsely to the North and then into the Germanic and Celtic lands. Thus, Latin evolved to become a central language in Europe from 27 BC to 476 AD.\n\nSecondly, there was the widespread usage of the pre-classical version of Han Chinese in contemporary China due to the unification of China in 221 BC by Qin Shi Huang.\n\nThirdly, Sanskrit started to become widely spoken in South Asia from the widespread teaching of Hinduism and Buddhism in South Asian countries.\n\nFourthly, the expansion of the Arabic empire also led to the increased usage of Arabic as a language in the Afro-Eurasian land mass.\n\nMilitary conquests of preceding centuries generally determine the distribution of languages today.\nSupercentral languages spread by land and sea. Land-bound languages spread via marching empires: German, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and Japanese. However, when the conquerors were defeated and were forced to move out of the territory, the spread of the languages receded. As a result, some of these languages are currently barely supercentral languages and are instead confined to their remaining state territories, as is evident from German, Russian and Japanese.\n\nOn the other hand, sea-bound languages spread by conquests overseas: English, French, Portuguese, Spanish. Consequently, these languages became widespread in areas settled by European colonisers and relegated the indigenous people and their languages to peripheral positions.\n\nBesides, the world-systems theory also allowed the global language system to expand further. It focuses on the existence of the core, semi-peripheral and peripheral nations. The core countries are the most economically powerful and the wealthiest countries. Besides, they also have a strong governmental system in the country, which oversees the bureaucracies in the governmental departments. There is also the prevalent existence of the bourgeois, and core nations have significant influence over the non-core, smaller nations. Historically, the core countries were found in northwestern Europe and include countries such as England, France and the Netherlands. They were the dominant countries that had colonized many other nations from the early 15th century to the early 19th century.\n\nThen is the existence of the periphery countries, the countries with the slowest economic growth. They also have relatively weak governments and a poor social structure and often depend on primary industries as the main source of economic activity for the country.\n\nThe extracting and exporting of raw materials from the peripheral nations to core nations is the activity bringing about the most economic benefits to the country. Much of the population that is poor and uneducated, and the countries are also extensively influenced by core nations and the multinational corporations found there. Historically, peripheral nations were found outside Europe, the continent of colonial masters. Many countries in Latin America were peripheral nations during the period of colonization, and today peripheral countries are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nLastly, the presence of the semiperiphery countries, those in between the core and the periphery. They tend to be those which started out as peripheral nations and are currently moving towards industrialization and the development of more diversified labour markets and economies. They can as well come about from declining core countries. They are not dominant players in the international trade market. As compared to the peripheral nations, semi-peripheries are not as susceptible to manipulation by the core countries. However, most of these nations have economic or political relations with the core. Semi-peripheries also tend to exert influence and control over peripheries and can serve to be a buffer between the core and peripheral nations and ease political tensions. Historically, Spain and Portugal were semi-peripheral nations after they fell from their dominant core positions. As they still maintained a certain level of influence and dominance in Latin America over their colonies, they could still maintain their semi-peripheral position.\n\nAccording to Immanuel Wallerstein, one of the most well-known theorists who developed the world-systems approach, a core nation is dominant over the non-core nations from its economic and trade dominance. The abundance of cheap and unskilled labour in the peripheral nations makes many large multinational corporations (MNCs), from core countries, often outsource their production to the peripheral countries to cut costs, by employing cheap labour. Hence, the languages from the core countries could penetrate into the peripheries from the setting up of the foreign MNCs in the peripheries. A significant percentage of the population living in the core countries had also migrated to the core countries in search of jobs with higher wages.\n\nThe gradual expansion of the population of migrants makes the language used in their home countries be brought into the core countries, thus allowing for further integration and expansion of the world language system. The semi-peripheries also maintain economic and financial trade with the peripheries and core countries. That allows for the penetration of languages used in the semi-peripheries into the core and peripheral nations, with the flow of migrants moving out of the semi-peripheral nations to the core and periphery for trade purposes.\n\nThus, the global language system examines rivalries and accommodations using a global perspective and establishes that the linguistic dimension of the world system goes hand in hand with the political, economic, cultural and ecological aspects. Specifically, the present global constellation of languages is the product of prior conquest and domination and of ongoing relations of power and exchange.\n\nformula_1 is the communicative value of a language \"i\", its potential to connect a speaker with other speakers of a constellation or subconstellation, \"S\". It is defined as follows:\n\nformula_2\n\nThe prevalence formula_3 of language \"i\", means the number of competent speakers in \"i\", formula_4, divided by all the speakers, formula_5 of constellation \"S\". Centrality, formula_6 is the number of multilingual speakers formula_7 who speak language \"i\" divided by all the multilingual speakers in constellation \"S\", formula_8.\n\nThus, the Q-value or communication value is the product of the prevalence formula_3 and the centrality formula_6 of language \"i\" in constellation \"S\".\n\nConsequently, a peripheral language has a low Q-value and the Q-values increase along the sociology classification of languages, with the Q-value of the hypercentral language being the highest.\n\nDe Swaan has been calculating the Q-values of the official European Union(EU) languages since 1957 to explain the acquisition of languages by EU citizens in different phases.\n\nIn 1970, when there were only four language constellations, Q-value decreased in the order of French, German, Italian, Dutch. In 1975, the European Commission enlarged to include Britain, Denmark and Ireland. English had the highest Q-value followed by French and German.\nIn the following years, the European Commission grew, with the addition of countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden. Q-value of English still remained the highest, but French and German swapped places.\n\nIn EU23, which refers to the 23 official languages spoken in the European Union, the Q-values for English, German and French were 0.194, 0.045 and 0.036 respectively.\n\nDe Swaan likens the global language system to contemporary political macrosociology and states that language constellations are a social phenomenon, which can be understood by using social science theories. In his theory, de Swaan uses the Political Sociology of Language and Political Economy of Language to explain the rivalry and accommodation between language groups.\n\nThis theoretical perspective centres on the interconnections among the state, nation and citizenship. Accordingly, bilingual elite groups try to take control of the opportunities for mediation between the monolingual group and the state. Subsequently, they use the official language to dominate the sectors of government and administration and the higher levels of employment. It assumes that both the established and outsider groups are able to communicate in a shared vernacular, but the latter groups lack the literacy skills that could allow them to learn the written form of the central or supercentral language, which would, in turn allow, them to move up the social ladder.\n\nThis perspective centres on the inclinations that people have towards learning one language over the other. The presumption is that if given a chance, people will learn the language that gives them more communication advantage. In other words, a higher Q-Value. Certain languages such as English or Chinese have high Q-values since they are spoken in many countries across the globe and would thus be more economically useful than to less spoken languages, such as Romanian or Hungarian.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, languages are ‘hypercollective’ goods since they exhibit properties of collective goods and produce external network effects. Thus, the more speakers a language has, the higher its communication value for each speaker. The hypercollective nature and Q-Value of languages thus help to explain the dilemma that a speaker of a peripheral language faces when deciding whether to learn the central or hypercentral language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also help to explain the accelerating spread and abandonment of various languages. In that sense, when people feel that a language is gaining new speakers, they would assign a greater Q-value to this language and abandon their own native language in place of a more central language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also explain, in an economic sense, the ethnic and cultural movements for language conservation.\n\nSpecifically, a minimal Q-value of a language is guaranteed when there is a critical mass of speakers committed to protecting it, thus preventing the language from being forsaken.\n\nThe global language system theorises that language groups are engaged in unequal competition on different levels globally. Using the notions of a periphery, semi-periphery and a core, which are concepts of the world system theory, de Swaan relates them to the four levels present in the hierarchy of the global language system: peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral.\n\nDe Swaan also argues that the greater the range of potential uses and users of a language, the higher the tendency of an individual to move up the hierarchy in the global language system and learn a more \"central\" language. Thus, de Swaan views the learning of second languages as proceeding up rather than down the hierarchy, in the sense that they learn a language that is on the next level up. For instance, speakers of Catalan, a peripheral language, have to learn Spanish, a central language to function in their own society, Spain. Meanwhile, speakers of Persian, a central language, have to learn Arabic, a supercentral language, to function in their region. On the other hand, speakers of a supercentral language have to learn the hypercentral language to function globally, as is evident from the huge number of non-native English speakers.\n\nAccording to de Swaan, languages exist in \"constellations\" and the global language system comprises a sociological classification of languages based on their social role for their speakers. The world's languages and multilinguals are connected in a strongly ordered, hierarchical pattern. There are thousands of peripheral or minority languages in the world, each of which are connected to one of a hundred central languages. The connections and patterns between each language is what makes up the global language system. The four levels of language are the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages.\n\nAt the lowest level, peripheral languages, or minority languages, form the majority of languages spoken in the world; 98% of the world's languages are peripheral languages and spoken by less than 10% of the world’s population. Unlike central languages, these are \"languages of conversation and narration rather than reading and writing, of memory and remembrance rather than record\". They are used by native speakers within a particular area and are in danger of becoming extinct with increasing globalisation, which sees more and more speakers of peripheral languages acquiring more central languages in order to communicate with others.\n\nThe next level constitutes about 100 central languages, spoken by 95% of the world's population and generally used in education, media and administration. Typically, they are the 'national' and official languages of the ruling state. These are the languages of record, and much of what has been said and written in those languages is saved in newspaper reports, minutes and proceedings, stored in archives, included in history books, collections of the 'classics', of folk talks and folk ways, increasingly recorded on electronic media and thus conserved for posterity.\n\nMany speakers of central languages are multilingual because they are either native speakers of a peripheral language and have acquired the central language, or they are native speakers of the central language and have learned a supercentral language.\n\nAt the second highest level, 13 supercentral languages are very widely spoken languages that serve as connectors between speakers of central languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Malay, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili and Turkish.\n\nThese languages often have colonial traces and \"were once imposed by a colonial power and after independence continued to be used in politics, administration, law, big business, technology and higher education\".\n\nAt the highest level is the language that connects speakers of the supercentral languages. Today, English is the only example of a hypercentral language as the standard for science, literature, business, and law, as well as being the most widely spoken second language.\n\nAccording to David Graddol (1997), in his book titled \"The Future of English\", the languages of the world comprise a \"hierarchical pyramid\", as follows:\n\n\nThe global language system is also seen in the international translation process as explained by Johan Heilbron, a historical sociologist: \"translations and the manifold activities these imply are embedded in and dependent on a world system of translation, including both the source and the target cultures\".\n\nThe hierarchical relationship between global languages is reflected in the global system for translations. The more \"central\" a language, the greater is its capability to function as a bridge or vehicular language to facilitate communication between peripheral and semi-central languages.\n\nHeilbron's version of the global system of language in translations has four levels:\n\nLevel 1: Hypercentral position — \nEnglish currently holds the largest market share of the global market for translations; 55–60% of all book translations are from English. It strongly dominates the hierarchical nature of book translation system.\n\nLevel 2: Central position — \nGerman and French each hold 10% of the global translation market.\n\nLevel 3: Semi-central position — \nThere are 7 or 8 languages \"neither very central on a global level nor very peripheral\", making up 1 to 3% of the world market (like Spanish, Italian and Russian).\n\nLevel 4: Peripheral position — \nLanguages from which \"less than 1% of the book translations worldwide are made\", including Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Despite having large populations of speakers, \"their role in the translation economy is peripheral as compared to more central languages\".\n\nAccording to the Google Scholar website, de Swaan's book, \"Words of the world: The global language system\", has been cited by 546 other papers, as of 16 October 2014.\n\nHowever, there have also been several concerns regarding the global language system:\n\nVan Parijs (2004) claimed that 'frequency' or likelihood of contact is adequate as an indicator of language learning and language spread. However, de Swaan (2007) argued that it alone is not sufficient. Rather, the Q-value, which comprises both frequency (better known as prevalence) and 'centrality', helps to explain the spread of (super)central languages, especially former colonial languages in newly independent countries where in which only the elite minority spoke the language initially. Frequency alone would not be able to explain the spread of such languages, but Q-value, which includes centrality, would be able to.\n\nIn another paper, Cook and Li (2009) examined the ways to categorise language users into various groups. They suggested two theories: one by Siegel (2006) who used 'sociolinguistic settings', which is based on the notion of dominant language, and another one by de Swaan (2001) that used the concept of hierarchy in the global language system. According to them, de Swaan's hierarchy is more appropriate, as it does not imply dominance in power terms. Rather, de Swaan's applies the concepts of geography and function to group languages and hence language users according to the global language system. De Swaan (2001) views the acquisition of second languages (L2) as typically going up the hierarchy.\n\nHowever, Cook and Li argues that this analysis is not adequate in accounting for the many groups of L2 users to whom the two areas of territory and function hardly apply. The two areas of territory and function can be associated respectively with the prevalence and centrality of the Q-value. This group of L2 users typically doez not acquire an L2 going up the hierarchy, such as users in an intercultural marriage or users who come from a particular cultural or ethnic group and wish to learn its language for identity purposes. Thus, Cook and Li argue that de Swaan's theory, though highly relevant, still has its drawbacks in that the concept behind Q-value is insufficient in accounting for some L2 users.\n\nThere is disagreement as to which languages should be considered more central. The theory states that a language is central if it connects speakers of \"a series of central languages\". Robert Phillipson questioned why Japanese is included as one of the supercentral languages but Bengali, which has more speakers, is not on the list.\n\nMichael Morris argued that while it is clear that there is language hierarchy from the \"ongoing interstate competition and power politics\", there is little evidence provided that shows that the \"global language interaction is so intense and systematic that it constitutes a global language system, and that the entire system is held together by one global language, English\". He claimed that de Swaan's case studies demonstrated that hierarchy in different regions of the world but did not show the existence of a system within a region or across regions. The global language system is supposed to be part of the international system but is \"notoriously vague and lacking in operational importance\" and therefore cannot be shown to exist. However, Morris believes that this lack of evidence could be from the lack of global language data and not negligence on de Swaan's part. Morris also believes that any theory on a global system, if later proved, would be much more complex than what is proposed by de Swaan. Questions on how the hypercentral language English holds together the system must also be answered by such a global language system.\n\nRobert Phillipson states that the theory is based on selective theoretical foundations. He claimed that there is a lack of consideration about the effects of globalization, which is especially important when the theory is about a global system: \"De Swaan nods occasionally in the direction of linguistic and cultural capital, but does not link this to class or linguistically defined social stratification (linguicism) or linguistic inequality\" and that \"key concepts in the sociology of language, language maintenance and shift, and language spread are scarcely mentioned\".\n\nOn the other hand, de Swaan's work in the field of sociolinguistics has been noted by other scholars to be focused on \"issues of economic and political sociology\" and \"politic and economic patterns\", which may explain why he makes only 'cautious references to socio-linguistic parameters\".\n\n"}

It is a designation used by Medicare/Medicaid in the US for determining MS-DRG reimbursement beginning with version 26 (October 1, 2008). Not only hospital-acquired infections but also any other situation or condition, such as pressure ulcers, blood type mismatch, or iatrogenic injury, can be a HAC.\n\nA patient at a hospital can be infected or otherwise degraded by hospital conditions and/or personnel in ways that are sometimes diagnosed as a \"complication.\" The US Medicare system designates some 1000+ ICD-9-CM diagnoses, out of over 14000 (as of 2009), as possible HACs. On February 8, 2006, the President signed the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005. Section 5001(c) of DRA requires the Secretary to identify conditions that are: (a) high cost or high volume or both, (b) result in the assignment of a case to a DRG that has a higher payment when present as a secondary diagnosis, and (c) could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines. Section 5001(c) provides that CMS can revise the list of conditions from time to time, as long as it contains at least two conditions. On July 31, 2008, in the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) fiscal year (FY) 2009 Final Rule, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) selected 10 categories of conditions for a HAC payment provision. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008, hospitals no longer receive additional payment for cases in which one of the selected conditions was not present on admission. That is, the case would be paid as though the secondary diagnosis were not present.\n\nThe following are the current, as of October 1, 2009 (MS-DRG v27), Hospital-Acquired Conditions:\n\nConditions selected for implementation\nThese conditions will have payment implications beginning in October 1, 2008.\nObject left in during surgery (998.4 CC) \nAir embolism (999.1 MCC) \n\nBlood incompatibility (999.6 CC)\n\nCatheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection, \n996.64 CC & one of the following specific infection codes: 112.2, 590.10, 590.11, 590.2, 590.3, \n590.80, 590.81, 590.9, 595.0, 595.3, 595.4, 595.81, 590.89, 595.9, 597.0, 597.80, 599.0 \nPressure Ulcers (707.00-.01 & 7-7.09 CCs; 707.02-09 MCCs) \n\nVascular Catheter Associated Infection (999.31 CC) \n\nSurgical Site Infection – Mediastinitis after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery (519.2 MCC & 36.10-.19) \n\nFalls and Trauma – Fractures, Dislocations, Intracranial Injuries, Crushing Injuries, and Burns (Codes will be considered in FY2009 IPPS Proposed Rule)\nAlmost all of the 1000+ diagnoses that are possible HACs are designated \"Falls and trauma.\"\n\nWhen a diagnosis is recorded, it is designated either \"Present on Admission\" (POA) or not. If the diagnosis is POA, it is not demoted.\n\nHowever, if a diagnosis is \"not\" POA, it might be demoted. Most HAC diagnoses are demoted if they are not POA. Some that are not so simple are designated above with the tag \"Proc,\" \"Diag,\" or both. In those situations, a diagnosis must also be accompanied by one of a specific set of diagnoses, procedures, or both to be demoted.\n\nFor instance, if a patient falls out of bed while in a hospital, the consequent broken hip was not present on admission, so the \"complication\" of \"broken hip\" would be demoted as a \"Falls and trauma\" HAC. The hospital would not be compensated for treatment of the injury. The intent of this sort of classification is to force hospitals to prevent such problems in the first place.\n\n"}

The occurrence of failures in the machinery can be costly and even catastrophic. In order to avoid them, there needs to be a system which analyzes the behavior of the machine and provides alarms and instructions for preventive maintenance. Analyzing the behavior of the machines has become possible by means of advanced sensors, data collection systems, data storage/transfer capabilities and data analytic tools developed for such purpose. More information on the related data analytic tools can be found in prognostics. The aggregation of data collection, storage, transformation, analysis and decision making for smart maintenance is called an intelligent maintenance system (IMS).\n\nAn intelligent maintenance system is a system that utilizes the history data by facilitating data analytics and decision support tools to predict and prevent the potential failure of the machines. With the growing complexity of manufacturing processes and machinery, the role of monitoring systems and intelligent maintenance is becoming more crucial. The recent advancements in information technology, computers and electronics have facilitated the design and implementation of such systems.\n\nBased on the industries growing demand in sustainability of the assets, different maintenance practices have been designed and implemented. The maintenance practices generally include condition-based maintenance (CBM), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), corrective maintenance, scheduled or planned maintenance and predictive maintenance. An intelligent maintenance system enhances the performance of predictive maintenance systems by utilizing the advancements in computer science, electronics and information technology.\nThe key research elements of intelligent maintenance systems consist of:\n\nCenter for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS Center) is an Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) that consists of the University of Cincinnati, the University of Michigan, and Missouri University of Science and Technology. Since 2001, IMS has been a frontrunner in advancing methods, tools and technologies for enabling the products and systems to achieve and sustain near-zero breakdown. The techniques and technologies developed by the IMS Center have been validated in over 70 projects conducted with research and industry partners across the globe. These projects include various applications from a wide range including manufacturing, energy, rotating machinery etc. [www.imscenter.net]. A complete list of publications by IMS Center can be found in its website. In 2012, a feasibility study conducted at North Carolina State University showed that among the NSF I/UCRC research centers across the U.S., IMS Center has had the biggest economic impact with the benefit of $238.3 for every dollar invested on it (238.3:1). Berkley Sensors and Actuators Center (BSAC) at UC Berkley and Industry-University Center for Surfactants (IUCS) at Columbia University were ranked second and third with economic impacts of 36.2:1 and 2.8:1 respectively.\n\nThe methodology for developing intelligent maintenance systems consist of finding the critical assets within a machine or process, instrumentation for collecting the suitable data, pre-processing and analyzing the collected data and extracting indicative features, applying the relevant machine-learning algorithms for health assessment, predicting the performance of the assets, and finally devising the appropriate maintenance action based on the obtained knowledge of the assets.\n\nThe \"5S\" approach was devised by the IMS Center in order to address the needs of future maintenance services. This systematic approach consists of five key elements: Streamline, Smart Processing, Synchronize, Standardize and Sustain.\n\nWatchdog Agent is the IMS Center's collection of tools and techniques for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). For developing intelligent maintenance systems, a major step is to properly select such tools for data analysis and facilitate a decision support system. This toolbox can be customized and reconfigured for nearly any application – from products and assets, to complex systems, processes or manufacturing lines. The Watchdog Agent® includes four categories of analytical tools that can be used to assess and predict the performance or degradation of machines and processes by extracting the performance-related features from inputs such as measured sensor data, controller signals, and also expert knowledge, etc. Prediction results are then used for maintenance decision-making infrastructure operations IMS Brochure. The Watchdog Agent® conducts its performance assessment based on the readings from multiple sensors that measure the critical properties of a process, machine or component. Since the degradation process alters the sensor measurements, the Watchdog Agent® is capable of quantitatively describing such changes in the sensor readings by using analytical tools and extracting those changes by means of appropriate tools and methods.\n\nAn intelligent maintenance system should have the flexibility of being reconfigured for different platforms and software languages. The platforms are divided into three categories: stand-alone, embedded and cloud-based. RPP is a designed platform that can be used for heath assessment and performance prediction. RPP can be installed on equipment and is capable of converting the data to information related to the performance. Such information can then be integrated into an asset management system proper maintenance decision-making.\n\nThe concept of closed-loop life cycle design refers to one of the aspects in the future of maintenance where an intelligent maintenance system can lead to redesigning the products for increased reliability and serviceability.\n\nThere are several important issues to be addressed for the effective maintenance of production systems. They include (1) how to assess the impact of a machine breakdown on the factory throughput and determine what to do first, (2) if an unscheduled machine failure occurs, or if several events occur simultaneously, which reactive maintenance job has the highest priority (3) which machine failure is most seriously endangering the production schedule, (4) where are the opportunities for maintenance without affecting production throughput, and (5) how to efficiently utilize the factory resources (e.g., maintenance crews) on the critical sections of the systems. IMS center has developed maintenance policies to answer these questions. Moreover, the developed policies have been successfully implemented to several automotive manufacturing plants, which have also won three \"BOSS\" Kettering awards given by General Motors.\n\nThe goal of intelligent maintenance systems is to achieve and sustain near-zero breakdown. This is defined as the future of maintenance in which an intelligent system can equip the machines and systems to achieve highest performance and near-zero breakdown with self-maintenance capabilities. Such goal can be achieved by the transformation of raw data to valuable information regarding the current and future condition of the asset or process being monitored.\nSuch vision has been introduced by Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati, and is summarized as a transformation of fail and fix maintenance practices to predict and prevent by focusing on frontier technologies in embedded and remote monitoring, prognostics, and intelligent decision support tools. The center also has trademarked Watchdog Agent prognostics toolbox and device-to-business (D2B) infotronics platform for e-maintenance systems.\nThe \"unmet needs\" to be addressed in the scope of future maintenance rely on three aspects:\n\nWith evolving applications of tether-free communication technologies e.g. Internet, the e-intelligence is gaining bigger impact on industries. Such impact has become a driving force for companies to shift the manufacturing operations from traditional factory integration practices towards an e-factory and e-supply chain philosophy. Such change is transforming the companies from a local factory automation to a global business automation. “It transforms companies from a local factory automation to a global enterprise and business automation. The technological advances for achieving this highly collaborative design and manufacturing environment are based on multimedia-type information-based engineering tools and a highly reliable communication system for enabling distributed procedures in concurrent engineering design, remote operation of manufacturing processes, and operation of distributed production systems.” The goal of e-manufacturing is to plant floor assets, predict the deviation of the quality of the products and possible loss of any equipment. This brings about the predictive maintenance capability for the machines. Utilizing such e-maintenance capability with a dynamic rescheduling of maintenance and operation can lead to achieving lower downtime.\n\nThe major functions and objectives of e-manufacturing are: “(a) provide a transparent, seamless and automated information exchange process to enable an only handle information once (OHIO) environment; (b) improve the utilization of plant floor assets using a holistic approach combining the tools of predictive maintenance techniques; (c) links entire SCM operation and asset optimization; and (d) deliver customer services utilizing the latest predictive intelligence methods and tether-free technologies”.\nThe e-Maintenance infrastructure consists of several information sectors:\n\nAs an effort to promote the science of PHM and contribute to the development of intelligent maintenance systems, the Prognostics and Health Management Society (PHM Society) sponsors an annual competition data challenge to both professional and student participants. Participants use the available data and their prior experience and algorithm knowhow for developing their health monitoring algorithms for the given application. The accuracy of the health monitoring algorithm output is compared with the true health state; the true health state is unknown to the participants but is known by the organizers of the data challenge.\n\nThe 2008 data challenge was the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction of jet engines. The simulated data set consisted of multivariate time series that were collected from multiple engine units. There were three operational settings that have a substantial effect on unit performance. The data for each cycle of each unit included the unit ID, cycle index, 3 values for the operational settings and 21 values for 21 sensor measurements. Each unit started with unknown degrees of initial degradation and manufacturing variation. The units were operating normally at the start of each time series, and developed a fault at some point during the series. The data set was further divided into training and testing subsets. In the training data set (218 units), the fault grew in magnitude until system failed. There is no \"hard\" failure in the data set; however, the remaining useful life of the last operational cycle of each unit in the training data was considered as zero. In the testing data set, the time series ended some time prior to system failure. The objective of the problem was to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the testing data set. A portion of the testing data set (218 units) was provided first to assist algorithm development and the rest (435 units) was released towards the end of the competition as the validation data set to score the algorithm.\n\nWinning team in student category and overall: Tianyi Wang from Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems at the University of Cincinnati.

The objective of the competition was to develop accurate health monitoring and diagnostic methods for gearbox components. The data provided consisted of 560 data sets, in which the gearbox was tested under 5 different speeds, 2 different loads, and two different gear types. The 560 data sets consisted of data in which the gearbox was under different conditions of the mechanical components. No training data set was provided for the data challenge and fault detection was to be performed by analyzing the available vibration and speed signals and comparing the results against the known gearbox signatures in the literature.\nWinning team in professional category and overall: Fangji Wu from Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems, University of Cincinnati.

The provided data consisted of collected force and acceleration signals in three directions along with the acoustic emission signals. The data was provided from six cutters and the participants were expected to estimate the remaining useful life of the cutters as they cut the work-piece. The actual wear measurement for three of the cutters was already provided along with the data to be used for training the models.

The objective of this challenge was to develop accurate sensor health monitoring methods for specific applications in anemometers. The data set provided for this challenge consisted of data from anemometers from two different configurations. The two configurations consist of the “paired” data set in which two anemometers are positioned at the same height, and the “shear” data set, which includes an array of anemometers at different heights. Various wind speed statistics, wind direction, and ambient temperature information are provided, in which the objective is to classify the anemometer health status during a set of samples from a 5 day period. More information about this data challenge can be found in.\nWinning team in student category and overall: David Siegel from Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems at University of Cincinnati\nWinning team in professional category: Danny Parker from Miltec Research and Technology\n\nIn 2012, no data challenge was organized by [www.phmsociety.org PHM Society] but instead, IEEE Reliability Society and FEMTO-ST Institute organized a data challenge focusing on the RUL estimation of bearings. The data was collected from 3 different loads (rotating speed and load force). Participants were provided with 6 run-to-failure datasets in order to build their prognostics models, and were asked to estimate accurately the RUL of 11 remaining bearings. Monitoring data of the 11 test bearings were truncated so that participants were supposed to predict the remaining life, and thereby perform RUL estimates. Also, no assumption about the type of failure to be occurred was given. The challenge datasets were characterized by a small amount of training data and a high variability in experiment durations (from 1h to 7h). Thereby, performing good estimates was quite di cult and this made the challenge more exciting. Note also that theoretical framework (L10, BPFI, BPFE, etc.) mismatches the experimental observations.\nWinning team in industrials category: Sergey Porotsky from A.L.D Ltd.\n\nWinning team in academic category: Arvind Sai Sarathi Vasan from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE), University of Maryland\n\nThe 2013 data challenge focused on maintenance action recommendation based on historical cases and the algorithms were evaluated on their ability to recommend confirmed problem types. This data was generated from an industrial piece of equipment with a sensor network to measure several parameters and an onboard condition monitoring system. The measured data goes through a control logic in order to monitor the equipment's operating regime. At any time instant when some of these parameters meet a specific condition, the control system generates a unique event ID/code. Each case is described by a set of event codes which characterize the atypical operating condition of the equipment. Some of these cases with specific event code combinations may be operationally significant and could be indicative of \"problem types\", some of which are assumed to be known to the subject matter experts.

{"id": "1306941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1306941", "title": "Kievian Letter", "text": "Kievian Letter\n\nThe Kievian Letter is an early 10th-century (ca. 930) letter thought to be written by representatives of the Jewish community in Kiev. The letter, a Hebrew-language recommendation written on behalf of one member of their community, was part of an enormous collection brought to Cambridge by Solomon Schechter from the Cairo Geniza. It was discovered in 1962 during a survey of the Geniza documents by Norman Golb of the University of Chicago. The letter is dated by most scholars to around 930 CE. Some think (on the basis of the \"pleading\" nature of the text, mentioned below) that the letter dates from a time when Khazars were no longer a dominant force in the politics of the city. According to Marcel Erdal, the letter does not come \"from\" Kiev but was sent \"to\" Kiev.\n\nSome scholars point to a district in Kievan Podil named after the Khazars (called \"Kozare\"), which indicates to some that Turkic Khazars did live in Kiev. The Khazars apparently played a significant role in the economic vitality of the city, importing caviar, fish, and salt into Kiev.\n\nIf so, it might at first glance suggest that Khazar control over Kiev, in some form or another, continued well into the tenth century, significantly later than the traditional date for conquest by Oleg, 882. On the other hand, from the letter itself it seems that the Khazar authorities could do little to help the Jewish community of Kiev; the letter itself had ended up in Egypt, and the beleaguered alms-seeker had presumably travelled thousands of miles in his search for relief. The identity and status of the reviewing, turcophone officer is therefore ambiguous. It would seem more likely that the letter was reviewed in Khazaria at a time when Khazar Jewish power had waned not only in Kiev but in the heartland itself (sometime in the 11th century).\n\nLinguists are interested in the letter because the names of the community members are of Turkic, Slavic, and Hebrew origins (for example, names such as: \"Hanukkah,\" \"Yehudah,\" \"Gostata,\" and \"Kiabar\"). There is some disagreement as to whether these Jews were Israelites who had taken local names, or whether their names indicate Turkic or Slavic origins. The debate is complicated by the presence of the name Kiabar Kohen. According to Omeljan Pritsak, this name indicates that non-Israelite Khazars adopted the status of Kohen, possibly because they had formed a pre-conversion priestly caste. An alternative scenario is that Israelite Jews in Khazaria adopted Khazar Turkic names, much in the same way that Jews, including prominent rabbis, had adopted Aramaic, Persian, Arabic, Greek, and German names. Recent studies determined that at least one of the names of signatories is Slavic and that it is likely that the signatories with non-Jewish names, were Jews who adopted local names.\n\nThe letter may contain the only written record of the Khazar language extant today - the single word-phrase \"I have read (it),\" though Erdal argues against this hypothesis and favours Bolgar-Chuvash (\"hakurüm\" from the reconstructed verb *\"okï-\", 'call out, recite, read'), and suggests that it originated in the Danube-Bulgar region. (Similar inscriptions, in Latin and Greek are found in Byzantine documents from roughly the same period.)\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are general descriptions of ergativity in Kurdish, as well as in specific forms of Kurdish, such as Sorani and Kurmanjî. \n\nSorani Kurdish has a split-ergative system. Transitive verbs show nominative/accusative marking in the present tense, and ergative marking in the past tense.\n\n\nEzafe is used with nouns to indicate possession. Ezafe (-y) joins the possessive noun with its possessed noun\n\njēgā-y pāsā = the king's place (\"Lit: place of king)\"\n\nEzafe is also used alongside pronouns to show possession. Ezafe (-y) joins the possessor pronoun with its possessed noun.\n\njēgā-y min = my place (\"Lit: place of me\")\n\nKurmanji uses two types of personal pronouns.\n\nThe \"ez\" forms (NOM.) are used as subjects in the present and future tenses. They are also used as subjects in past tenses when the verb is an intransitive one. They are used as objects in past tenses when employed with a transitive verb.\nThe \"min\" forms (OBL.) are used with any preposition or postposition. They are also employed as objects in present and future tenses, but as subjects of the transitive verbs in past tenses.\n\nKurmanji has lost the suffixes for OBL pronouns, whereas Sorani has lost nominative normal pronouns.\n\nSorani personal pronouns have three persons and both singular and plural form. Gender is not marked. \nIn Sorani, adjectives follow the head noun and may be joined by 'ezafe' or an open compound structure. The following example shows the Ezafe construction:\n\npyāw-ī  čak = a good fellow (\"Lit: man of good\")\n\nDemonstrative pronouns when followed by postpositions (attached to the nouns) become demonstrative adjectives.\n\nAs demonstrative adjectives, Sorani Kurdish does not use OBL forms (though for demonstrative pronouns it does use OBL. plural forms); neither Kurmanji uses nominative plural forms.\n\nKurdish verbs agree with their subjects in person and number. They have the following major characteristics:\n\n\nPresent and future tenses for the verb \"zanîn\" ( to know).\n\nPast tenses for intransitive verb of \"hatin\" (to come).\nIf a past transitive verb accepts a nominative personal suffix, it agrees with the object of the sentence.\nTransitive past verbs in Sorani have OBL connected/dependent(not independent) personal pronouns on the object, if object is not mentioned they are on prefix or first part of the verb if the verb was compound, if there were not any prefix so they will be on the same place as th NOM ones.\nOBL connected pronouns: -m, -t, -y, -man, -tan, -yan.\n\nThe normal word order in Kurdish is Subject-Object-Verb (S-O-V). Modifiers follow the nouns they modify.\n\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, Oraons depended on the forest and farms for their ritual and economic livelihood, but in recent times, a few of them have become mainly settled agriculturalists. Small numbers of Oraons have migrated to the northeastern part of India, where they are mainly employed in tea estates. Population estimates are unreliable, but the total population is estimated to be around 3.5 to 4.5 million people.\n\n\"Oraon\" is an exonym assigned by neighboring Munda peoples, meaning \"to roam.\"\n\nAccording to the Indian Anthropological Society, Konkan is said to be the original home of the Kurukh tribes, Kurukh Brahmins and Kshatriyas, from where they migrated to Northern India. A Kurukh substratum is very prominent in the Konkani language.\n\nKurukhar are divided into many totemistic clans. They live all throughout the Chota Nagpur Plateau in east-central India: in Raigarh, Surguja, and Jashpur districts of Chhattisgarh; Ranchi district of Jharkhand; Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal; Sundergarh district of Odisha, Bihar; Rakhine State in Myanmar, and Bangladesh. A sizable number of Oraon have migrated to the northeastern part of India, where they are mainly employed in tea estates of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura.\n\nGotra or Totem system plays very important role in the social structure of the Kurukh. Among the Oraons, the Gotra system is believed to directly relate to their god Lord Dharmesh’s desire to keep the social structure of the tribe pious. Gotra means that every single family in the Oraon tribe trace their roots to their ancestors’ respective families, each of these families further traced their roots to their unique Gotra. It is also believed that these auspicious living beings helped their ancestors’ families to come out of the difficult times and as a result the entire generations of the families of a certain Gotra are indebted to them.\n\nSince time immemorial The Oraon people have a rich range of folk songs, dances and tales, as well as traditional musical instruments. Both men and women participate in dances, which are performed at social events and festivals. The Mandar, Nagara and Kartal are the main musical instruments. During festivals or any occasions of celebration they consume an alcoholic drink called \"handiya\", a rice wine made from fermented rice, which distributed among all villagers in a \"Dona\", a bowl of leaves.\n\nKurukh Brahmins and Kshatriya follow Lord Shiva and Goddess Durga. But, they are not related to Kurukh Tribes.\n\nA unit of 5 villages represented a sector like today's Gram Panchayat. The unit of 33 villages was called RajiParha and it was headed by the king himself. With the help of this federal structured Parha the king was able to implement various schemes for\nthe development of the subjects. The citizens were provided due justice through these Parha units. The law and order were perfectly maintained by the employed heads of each Parha unit. These administrative units of the Parha were, however, paralysed\nin the course of the Muslim invasions. The Orams establish concrete link of the history of Parha with that of the Indian independence movement.\n\nMahatma Gandhi, according to them, came to know about the merits of the Parha organization when he visited Chotanagpur. Imbibing the functioning pattern of this old Parha organization, Mahatma Gandhi discovered a system of 'Panchayat Raj'. Due to PESA Padaha system of is still the best and cheapest justice system of Oraon tribe. They resolve their differences, set priority areas and take decisions for the welfare of the community.\n\nThe Oraon follow the Sarna Dharam (Sarnaism), which is based on nature worship. Some of the groups started following Sarnaism in a Hindu style, as the sects of the Bishnu Bhagats, Bacchinda Bhagats, Karmu Bhagats and Tana Bhagats. The Oraons have established several Sarna sects. Oraons worship Sun biri (a name given for Dharmesh). Kurukhar also believe in Animism.\n\nMost of population is Sarna, which is a religion that is indigenous to Adivasis in Central India.\nSarna perform religious rituals under the shade of a sacred grove. They worship the sun as Biri and the moon as Chando, and call the earth Dharti Aayo (Earth as mother). Chando Biri are the words which are used in Sarna pujas. Dharmesh is their supreme almighty god.\n\nKamru Bhagats (Oaron or Munda devotees) originated when Oarons acquired special powers after making a pilgrimage to Kamakhya in Assam to pay respect to Durga.\n\nThe Kurukh Brahmin and Kshatriya are a caste of Hinduism. They believed in Lord Shiva and Goddess Durga.\n\nThe Tana Bhagat was formed by Oaron saints Jatra Bhagat and Turia Bhagat. Tana Bhagats opposed the taxes imposed on them by the British and staged a Satyagraha movement even before Mahatma Gandhi. All Tana Bhagats were followers of Gandhi during the Independence movement. Tana Bhagats still wear a khadi kurta, dhoti and Gandhi topi (cap) with tricoloured flag in their topi. All Tana Bhagats perform puja to the Mahadeo and the tricolour with a chakra symbol on it, which is fixed at their courtyard.\n\nAmong Christian Oraons, there are Roman Catholics and Protestants, the latter of which having several denominations.\n\nIn 1957, film-maker Ritwik Ghatak shot a preparatory test film named \"Oraon\" on the life of the Adivasis of the Ranchi region in Jharkhand and on the Oraons of Rani Khatanga Village in Jharkhand.\n\n\n\n\n\"This article includes material from the 1995 public domain Library of Congress Country Study on India.\"\n"}

Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (judiciary, legislature, administration). Since \"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\", the term \"official language\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government.\n\nAbout half the countries of the world have declared one or more official languages. The government of Italy officialised Italian only in 1999, and some nations (such as the United States) have never declared official languages at the national level. Other nations have declared non-indigenous official languages. \"The Philippines and parts of Africa live with a peculiar cultural paradox. Although the official languages [in Africa] may be French or English, these are not the languages most widely spoken by [the country's] residents.\"\n\nWorldwide, 178 countries have at least one official language, and 101 of these countries recognise more than one language. Many of the world's constitutions mention one or more official or national languages. Some countries use the official language designation to empower indigenous groups by giving them access to the government in their native languages. In countries that do not formally designate an official language, a \"de facto\" national language usually evolves. English is the most common official language, with recognized status in 51 countries. Arabic, French, and Spanish are also widely recognized.\n\nAn official language that is also an indigenous language is called \"endoglossic\", one that is not indigenous is \"exoglossic\". An instance is Nigeria which has three endoglossic official languages. By this the country aims to protect the indigenous languages although at the same time recognising the English language as its lingua franca.\n\nAround 500 BC, when Darius the Great annexed Mesopotamia to the Persian Empire, he chose a form of the Aramaic language (the so-called Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic) as the vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. Aramaic script was widely employed from Egypt in the southwest to Bactria and Sogdiana in the northeast. Texts were dictated in the native dialects and written down in Aramaic, and then read out again in the native language at the places they were received.\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin standardized the written language of China after unifying the country in 221 BC. Classical Chinese would remain the standard written language for the next 2000 years. Standardization of the spoken language received less political attention, and Mandarin developed on an \"ad hoc\" basis from the dialects of the various imperial capitals until being officially standardized in the early twentieth century.\n\nAccording to an undated chart by the American pro-English-only organization known as U.S. English, 178 countries have an official language at the national level. Among those, English is the most common with 67 nations giving it official status. French is second with 29 countries, Arabic is third with 26 countries and Spanish is fourth with 19 countries, Portuguese is the official language of 9 countries and German is official in 6. Some countries—like Australia, United Kingdom and the United States—have no official language recognized as such at national level. On the other extreme, Bolivia officially recognizes 37 languages, the most by any country in the world. Second to Bolivia is India with 23 official languages. South Africa is the country with the most official languages, all at equal status to one another, in the world. As Bolivia gives primacy to Spanish and India gives primacy to both English and Hindi.\n\nThe selection of an official language (or no official language) is often contentious. An alternative to having a single official language is \"official multilingualism\", where a government recognizes multiple official languages. Under this system, all government services are available in all official languages. Each citizen may choose their preferred language when conducting business. Most countries are multilingual and many are officially multilingual. Taiwan, Canada, Philippines, Belgium, Switzerland, and the European Union are examples of official multilingualism. This has been described as controversial and, in some other areas where it has been proposed, the idea has been rejected. It has also been described as necessary for the recognition of different groups or as an advantage for the country in presenting itself to outsiders.\n\nIn accordance with \"Chapter 1, Article 16\" of the Constitution of Afghanistan, the Afghan government gives equal status to Pashto and Dari as official languages.\n\nBelarusian and Russian have official status in the Republic of Belarus.\n\nIn accordance with the \"Constitution Act, 1982\" the (federal) Government of Canada gives equal status to English and French as official languages. The Province of New Brunswick is also officially bilingual, as is the Yukon. Nunavut has four official languages. The Northwest Territories has eleven official languages. All provinces, however, offer some necessary services in both English and French.\n\nCanadian advocates of a single official language say it promotes national identity. In Canada, debate has focused on whether the local majority language should be made the exclusive language of public business. In the Canadian province of Quebec, for example, laws restrict the use of the minority English in education, on signs, and in the workplace.\n\nAccording to the Finnish constitution, Finnish and Swedish are the official languages of the republic. Citizens have the right to communicate in either language with government agencies. \n\nGerman is the official language of Germany. However, its minority languages include Sorbian (Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian), Romani, Danish and North Frisian, which are officially recognised. Migrant languages like Turkish, Russian and Spanish are widespread, but are not officially recognised languages.\n\nHong Kong has two official languages: English and Chinese. Hong Kong Cantonese is used in daily conversation and Traditional Chinese used to be the only writing system in Hong Kong before the 1997 handover. However, in Mainland China the official language is Mandarin and Simplified Chinese is used as the standard writing system. As time goes by, signage in simplified characters has gained some popularity in a few areas. Some companies may have changed the characters of the signs whilst nearly all Hong Kong people continue to use traditional characters.\n\nThe Constitution of India (part 17) designates the official language of the Government of India as English as well as Standard Hindi written in the Devanagari script.\n\nThe Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement. In addition, the Government of India has awarded the distinction of classical language to Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Odia.\n\nOn 19 July 2018, the Knesset passed a basic law under the title , which defines Hebrew as \"the State's language\" and Arabic as a language with \"a special status in the State\" (article 4). The law further says that it should not be interpreted as compromising the status of the Arabic language in practice prior to the enactment of the basic law, namely, it preserves the status quo and changes the status of Hebrew and Arabic only nominally.\n\nBefore the enactment of the aforementioned basic law, the status of official language in Israel was determined by the 82nd paragraph of the \"Palestine Order in Council\" issued on 14 August 1922, for the British Mandate of Palestine, as amended in 1939:\n\nThis law, like most other laws of the British Mandate, was adopted in the State of Israel, subject to certain amendments published by the provisional legislative branch on 19 May 1948. The amendment states that:\n\nIn most public schools, the main teaching language is Hebrew, English is taught as a second language, and most students learn a third language, usually Arabic but not necessarily. Other public schools have Arabic as their main teaching language, and they teach Hebrew as a second language and English as a third one. There are also bilingual schools which aim to teach in both Hebrew and Arabic equally. \n\nSome languages other than Hebrew and Arabic, such as English, Russian, Amharic, Yiddish and Ladino enjoy a somewhat special status, but are not considered to be official languages. For instance, at least 5% of the broadcasting time of privately owned TV-channels must be translated into Russian (a similar privilege is granted to Arabic), warnings must be translated to several languages, signs are mostly trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic and English), and the government supports Yiddish and Ladino culture (alongside Hebrew culture and Arabic culture).\n\nThe Constitution of Latvia (or Satversme) designated Latvian as the state language. In 2012 there was initiative to hold a referendum on constitutional amendments, elevating Russian as a state language. Kristīne Jarinovska in her analysis describes the proposal in the following way: \n\nIt proposed several constitutional amendments for introducing Russian as Latvia's second official language—i.e., amendments to the Satversme’s Articles 4 (on Latvian as the state language), 18 (on the solemn promise of a member of Parliament to strengthen the Latvian language), 21 (on Latvian as the working language of the Parliament), 101 (on Latvian as the working language of local governments), and 104 (on the right to receive a reply to a petition in Latvian). Obviously, the proposed amendments would have influenced other constitutional norms as well. Moreover, since Article 4 of the Satversme alike norms of independence, democracy, sovereignty, territorial wholeness, and basic principles of elections that form the core of the Satversme (according to Article 77 of the Satversme), the initiative, in fact, proposed discontinuing an existing state and establishing a new one that is no longer a nation-state wherein Latvians exercise their rights to self-determination, enjoying and maintaining their cultural uniqueness\n\nNew Zealand has three official languages. English is the \"de facto\" and principle official language, accepted in all situations. The Māori language and New Zealand Sign Language both have limited \"de jure\" official status under the Māori Language Act 1987 and New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006\n\nUrdu is the national language of Pakistan. Urdu and English both are official languages in Pakistan. Pakistan has more than 60 languages. 52 of them are types of Punjabi.\n\nRussian is the official language of the Russian Federation and in all federal subjects, however many minority languages have official status in the areas where they are indigenous. One type of federal subject in Russia,\nrepublics, are allowed to adopt additional official languages alongside Russian in their own constitutions. Republics are often based around particular native ethnic groups, and are often areas where ethnic Russians and native Russian-language speakers are a minority.\n\nSouth Africa has eleven official languages that are mostly indigenous. Due to limited funding, however, the government rarely produces documents in most of the languages. Accusations of mismanagement and corruption have been leveled against the Pan South African Language Board, which is in charge of maintaining the system.\n\nStandard Chinese is the de facto official language of Taiwan. Note that Standard Chinese spoken in Taiwan is slightly different from that in Mainland China, and variant forms of the former are called Taiwanese Mandarin, locally known as 國語. The Hakka Basic Act and the Indigenous Languages Development Act have recognized the Formosan languages and Taiwanese Hakka (variant forms of Hakka Chinese) as national languages of Taiwan.\n\nIn 2012 debate over adopting Russian as a regional language in Ukraine caused \"an all-out brawl in Parliament\", protests, and the resignation of a lawmaker in attempt to block the bill.\n\nThe de facto official language of the United Kingdom is English.\nIn Wales, the Welsh language, spoken by approximately 20% of the population, has limited de jure official status..\n\nEnglish is the de facto national language of the United States. While there is no official language at the federal level, 32 of the 50 U.S. states and all six inhabited U.S. territories have designated English as one, or the only, official language, while courts have found that residents in the 50 states do not have a right to government services in their preferred language. Public debate in the last few decades has focused on whether Spanish should be recognized by the government, or whether all business should be done in English.\n\nCalifornia allows people to take their driving test in the following 32 languages: Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Laotian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.\n\nNew York state provides voter-registration forms in the following five languages: Bengali, Chinese, English, Korean and Spanish. The same languages are also on ballot papers in certain parts of the state (namely, New York City).\n\nThe pro-English-only website U.S. English sees a multilingual government as one in which its \"services actually encourage the growth of linguistic enclaves...[and] contributes to racial and ethnic conflicts\". Opponents of an official language policy in the United States argue that it would hamper \"the government's ability to reach out, communicate, and warn people in the event of a natural or man-made disaster such as a hurricane, pandemic, or...another terrorist attack\". Professor of politics Alan Patten argues that disengagement (officially ignoring the issue) works well in religious issues but that it is not possible with language issues because it must offer public services in some language. Even if it makes a conscious effort not to establish an official language, a \"de facto\" official language, or the \"national language\", will nevertheless emerge. Indeed, two-thirds of Americans believe that English is the United States' official language.\n\nSometimes an official language definition can be motivated more by national identity than by linguistic concerns. When Yugoslavia dissolved in 1991, the country had four official languages—Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Albanian and Macedonian. Serbo-Croatian was used as a \"lingua franca\" for mutual understanding and was also the language of the military. \n\nWhen Croatia declared independence (1991) it defined its official language as Croatian, and Serbia likewise defined its official language as Serbian. Bosnia-Herzegovina defined three official languages: Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian. From the linguistic point of view, the different names refer to national varieties of the same language, which is known under the appellation of Serbo-Croatian. It is said by some that the Bosnian government chose to define three languages to reinforce ethnic differences and keep the country divided.\nThe language used in Montenegro, traditionally considered a dialect of Serbian, became standardized as the Montenegrin language upon Montenegro's declaration (2006) of independence.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45059", "title": "Part of speech", "text": "Part of speech\n\nIn traditional grammar, a part of speech (abbreviated form: PoS or POS) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) which have similar grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar behavior in terms of syntax—they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences—and sometimes in terms of morphology, in that they undergo inflection for similar properties. Commonly listed English parts of speech are \"noun\", \"verb\", \"adjective\", \"adverb\", \"pronoun\", \"preposition\", \"conjunction\", \"interjection\", and sometimes \"numeral\", \"article\" or \"determiner\".\n\nEssentially all these word classes exist within all Indo-European languages, even though articles might sometimes be considered as a part of a noun. Other European languages such as Hungarian and Finnish that belong to the Uralic language family may completely lack prepositions or only have very few of them; rather, they have postpositions.\n\nA part of speech—particularly in more modern classifications, which often make more precise distinctions than the traditional scheme does—may also be called a word class, lexical class, or lexical category, although the term \"lexical category\" refers in some contexts to a particular type of syntactic category, and may thus exclude parts of speech that are considered to be functional, such as pronouns. The term form class is also used, although this has various conflicting definitions. Word classes may be classified as open or closed: \"open classes\" (like nouns, verbs and adjectives) acquire new members constantly, while \"closed classes\" (such as pronouns and conjunctions) acquire new members infrequently, if at all.\n\nAlmost all languages have the word classes \"noun\" and \"verb\", but beyond these there are significant variations in different languages. For example, Japanese has as many as three classes of adjectives where English has one (not to be confused with the seven (7) types of English adjectives, or the fact that English adjectives can modify both nouns and pronouns); Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese have a class of nominal classifiers; many languages lack a distinction between adjectives and adverbs, or between adjectives and verbs (see stative verb). This variation in the number of categories and their identifying properties means that analysis needs to be done for each individual language. Nevertheless, the labels for each category are assigned on the basis of universal criteria.\n\nThe classification of words into lexical categories is found from the earliest moments in the history of linguistics.\n\nIn the \"Nirukta\", written in the 5th or 6th century BC, the Sanskrit grammarian Yāska defined four main categories of words:\n\nThese four were grouped into two larger classes: inflectable (nouns and verbs) and uninflectable (pre-verbs and particles).\n\nThe ancient work on the grammar of the Tamil language, \"Tolkāppiyam\", argued to have been written around 2,500 years ago, classifies Tamil words as \"peyar\" (பெயர்; noun), \"vinai\" (வினை; verb), \"idai\" (part of speech which modifies the relationships between verbs and nouns), and \"uri\" (word that further qualifies a noun or verb).\n\nA century or two after the work of Nirukta, the Greek scholar Plato wrote in his \"Cratylus\" dialog that \"... sentences are, I conceive, a combination of verbs [\"rhêma\"] and nouns [\"ónoma\"]\". Aristotle added another class, \"conjunction\" [\"sýndesmos\"], which included not only the words known today as conjunctions, but also other parts (the interpretations differ; in one interpretation it is pronouns, prepositions, and the article).\n\nBy the end of the 2nd century BC grammarians had expanded this classification scheme into eight categories, seen in the \"Art of Grammar\", attributed to Dionysius Thrax:\n\n\nIt can be seen that these parts of speech are defined by morphological, syntactic and semantic criteria.\n\nThe Latin grammarian Priscian (fl. 500 AD) modified the above eightfold system, excluding \"article\" (since the Latin language, unlike Greek, does not have articles), but adding \"interjection\".\n\nThe Latin names for the parts of speech, from which the corresponding modern English terms derive, were \"nomen\", \"verbum\", \"participium\", \"pronomen\", \"praepositio\", \"adverbium\", \"conjunctio\" and \"interjectio\". The category \"nomen\" included substantives (\"nomen substantivum\", corresponding to what are today called nouns in English), adjectives \"(nomen adjectivum)\" and numerals \"(nomen numerale)\". This is reflected in the older English terminology \"noun substantive\", \"noun adjective\" and \"noun numeral\". Later the adjective became a separate class, as often did the numerals, and the English word \"noun\" came to be applied to substantives only.\n\nWorks of English grammar generally follow the pattern of the European tradition as described above, except that participles are now usually regarded as forms of verbs rather than as a separate part of speech, and numerals are often conflated with other parts of speech: nouns (cardinal numerals, e.g., \"one\", and collective numerals, e.g., \"dozen\"), adjectives (ordinal numerals, e.g., \"first\", and multiplier numerals, e.g., \"single\") and adverbs (multiplicative numerals, e.g., \"once\", and distributive numerals, e.g., \"singly\"). Eight or nine parts of speech are commonly listed:\n\n\nSome modern classifications define further classes in addition to these. For discussion see the sections below.\n\nThe classification below, or slight expansions of it, is still followed in most dictionaries: \nEnglish words are not generally marked as belonging to one part of speech or another; this contrasts with many other European languages, which use inflection more extensively, meaning that a given word form can often be identified as belonging to a particular part of speech and having certain additional grammatical properties. In English, most words are uninflected, while the inflected endings that exist are mostly ambiguous: \"-ed\" may mark a verbal past tense, a participle or a fully adjectival form; \"-s\" may mark a plural noun or a present-tense verb form; \"-ing\" may mark a participle, gerund, or pure adjective or noun. Although \"-ly\" is a frequent adverb marker, some adverbs (e.g. \"tomorrow\", \"fast\", \"very\") do not have that ending, while some adjectives do have that ending (e.g. \"friendly\", \"ugly\", \"lovely\").\n\nMany English words can belong to more than one part of speech. Words like \"neigh\", \"break\", \"outlaw\", \"laser\", \"microwave\", and \"telephone\" might all be either verbs or nouns. In certain circumstances, even words with primarily grammatical functions can be used as verbs or nouns, as in, \"We must look to the \"hows\" and not just the \"whys\".\" The process whereby a word comes to be used as a different part of speech is called conversion or zero derivation.\n\nLinguists recognize that the above list of eight or nine word classes is drastically simplified. For example, \"adverb\" is to some extent a catch-all class that includes words with many different functions. Some have even argued that the most basic of category distinctions, that of nouns and verbs, is unfounded, or not applicable to certain languages. Modern linguists have proposed many different schemes whereby the words of English or other languages are placed into more specific categories and subcategories based on a more precise understanding of their grammatical functions.\n\nCommon lexical categories defined by function may include the following (not all of them will necessarily be applicable in a given language):\n\nWithin a given category, subgroups of words may be identified based on more precise grammatical properties. For example, verbs may be specified according to the number and type of objects or other complements which they take. This is called subcategorization.\n\nMany modern descriptions of grammar include not only lexical categories or word classes, but also \"phrasal categories\", used to classify phrases, in the sense of groups of words that form units having specific grammatical functions. Phrasal categories may include noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP) and so on. Lexical and phrasal categories together are called syntactic categories.\n\nWord classes may be either open or closed. An open class is one that commonly accepts the addition of new words, while a closed class is one to which new items are very rarely added. Open classes normally contain large numbers of words, while closed classes are much smaller. Typical open classes found in English and many other languages are nouns, verbs (excluding auxiliary verbs, if these are regarded as a separate class), adjectives, adverbs and interjections. Ideophones are often an open class, though less familiar to English speakers, and are often open to nonce words. Typical closed classes are prepositions (or postpositions), determiners, conjunctions, and pronouns.\n\nThe open–closed distinction is related to the distinction between lexical and functional categories, and to that between content words and function words, and some authors consider these identical, but the connection is not strict. Open classes are generally lexical categories in the stricter sense, containing words with greater semantic content, while closed classes are normally functional categories, consisting of words that perform essentially grammatical functions. This is not universal: in many languages verbs and adjectives are closed classes, usually consisting of few members, and in Japanese the formation of new pronouns from existing nouns is relatively common, though to what extent these form a distinct word class is debated.\n\nWords are added to open classes through such processes as compounding, derivation, coining, and borrowing. When a new word is added through some such process, it can subsequently be used grammatically in sentences in the same ways as other words in its class. A closed class may obtain new items through these same processes, but such changes are much rarer and take much more time. A closed class is normally seen as part of the core language and is not expected to change. In English, for example, new nouns, verbs, etc. are being added to the language constantly (including by the common process of verbing and other types of conversion, where an existing word comes to be used in a different part of speech). However, it is very unusual for a new pronoun, for example, to become accepted in the language, even in cases where there may be felt to be a need for one, as in the case of gender-neutral pronouns.\n\nThe open or closed status of word classes varies between languages, even assuming that corresponding word classes exist. Most conspicuously, in many languages verbs and adjectives form closed classes of content words. An extreme example is found in Jingulu, which has only three verbs, while even the modern Indo-European Persian has no more than a few hundred simple verbs, a great deal of which are archaic. (Some twenty Persian verbs are used as light verbs to form compounds; this lack of lexical verbs is shared with other Iranian languages.) Japanese is similar, having few lexical verbs. Basque verbs are also a closed class, with the vast majority of verbal senses instead expressed periphrastically.\n\nIn Japanese, verbs and adjectives are closed classes, though these are quite large, with about 700 adjectives, and verbs have opened slightly in recent years. Japanese adjectives are closely related to verbs (they can predicate a sentence, for instance). New verbal meanings are nearly always expressed periphrastically by appending to a noun, as in , and new adjectival meanings are nearly always expressed by adjectival nouns, using the suffix when an adjectival noun modifies a noun phrase, as in . The closedness of verbs has weakened in recent years, and in a few cases new verbs are created by appending to a noun or using it to replace the end of a word. This is mostly in casual speech for borrowed words, with the most well-established example being , from . This recent innovation aside, the huge contribution of Sino-Japanese vocabulary was almost entirely borrowed as nouns (often verbal nouns or adjectival nouns). Other languages where adjectives are closed class include Swahili, Bemba, and Luganda.\n\nBy contrast, Japanese pronouns are open class—if they can even be considered a class—and nouns become used as pronouns with some frequency; a recent example , now used by some young men as a first-person pronoun. The status of Japanese pronouns as a distinct class is disputed, however, with some considering it only a use of nouns, not a distinct class. The case is similar in languages of Southeast Asia, including Thai and Lao, in which, like Japanese, pronouns and terms of address vary significantly based on relative social standing and respect.\n\nSome word classes are universally closed, however, including demonstratives and interrogative words.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4275352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4275352", "title": "Paumarí language", "text": "Paumarí language\n\nPaumarí (also Paumari, Purupuru, Kurukuru, Pamari, Purupurú, Pammari, Curucuru, Palmari) is an Arauan language spoken in Brazil by about 300 older adults out of an ethnic population of 900. It is spoken by the Paumari Indians, who call their language “Pamoari”. The word “Pamoari” has several different meanings in the Paumarí language: ‘man,’ ‘people,’ ‘human being,’ and ‘client.’ These multiple meanings stem from their different relationships with outsiders; presumably it means ‘human being’ when they refer to themselves to someone of ostensibly equal status, and ‘client’ when referring to their people among river traders and Portuguese speakers.\n\nIncreasingly, speakers of Arawan languages, particularly Paumarí (who have had the most contact with non-natives) are beginning to speak Portuguese. The result, for many of the speakers in Paumarí, is a hybrid of Portuguese and Paumarí, incorporating vocabulary from both languages while retaining the syntax of neither (Chapman, a researcher from the Summer Institute of Linguistics, claims that, at the time of her arrival in 1964, all Paumarí spoke a mixture of Paumarí and Portuguese). Out of the Paumarí group that inhabits the Tapauá River, the youth, which makes up nearly a majority of the population, spoke only Portuguese in 1964. This ‘linguistic Creole’ tendency in the Paumarí language highlights exactly why languages such as Paumarí are endangered.\n\nIt is a largely head-marking language with unmarked VOS order and an ergative alignment for marking of nouns combined with accusative marking of pronouns.\n\nPaumarí has only two open word classes - nouns and verbs. However, it also has numerous closed classes including fourteen adjectives, adpositions, interjections, conjunctions and demonstratives. Paumarí nouns are elaborately divided into over one hundred possessed nouns and a larger number of free nouns. Furthermore, each free noun has grammatical gender - being either masculine or feminine, with feminine being the unmarked gender and indicated by the suffix \"-ni\".\n\nVerb roots have up to fifteen suffix positions, but all are only optionally filled. Most of these refer to location or aspect, plus a negative suffix \"-ra\".\n\nPaumarí has a larger consonant inventory than most languages of the Amazon Basin, and is notable for featuring bilabial and coronal implosives, which have been lost from other Arauan languages but are reconstructed clearly for the protolanguage of the family. It is one of very few languages in the New World to contrast implosives with other voiced stop consonants: similar contrasts are known only for a few other Amazonian languages. However, it has a very simple vowel system with only three contrastive vowels, the back one of which can range from to .\n\nPaumarí has a (C)V syllable structure: a syllable can only contain one vowel, which may or may not be preceded by a consonant. This is consistent among all Arawan languages (Dixon (1999), 295). Often two vowels will occur in a sequence, CVV, however, the length of the resulting syllable will often make a phonetic difference between the two vowels, and the syllable’s duration will correspond to the amount of vowels, reflecting a moraic structure also common in Japanese. Often in the Paumarí language, when an identical vowel occurs word-final and then word-initial in two sequential words, one of the two vowels will be dropped within the phrase.\n\nPaumarí tends to be a head-final language. Typically, in intransitive phrases (those without direct objects) the order is VS. The SV intransitive order also occurs, although only when the Subject is marked for informational prominence (the demonstrative (DEM) is occluded in such SV phrases). In transitive phrases, the word order is mainly SVO, in which the ergative case marking system tends to be used. The affix used for ergative marking is the suffix “-a”, and the object of the sentence is preceded by a word denoting a demonstrative case. These demonstrative case nouns are either “ada” for male, or “ida” for female. The gender and number of the object noun, not the subject, dictates the gender and number suffixes on the verb .\n\nTwo other word orders that occur in Paumarí transitive phrases are OVS and SOV. In these cases, the object is marked with a suffix denoting it as such (-ra) and is placed directly before the verb. In these cases, it is thought that the accusative system has taken over, as the subject of the sentence no longer receives the ergative suffix ‘-a’ and is free to occur at the beginning or end of the phrase (but not directly before the verb). This shows the split ergativity evident in Paumarí language – they employ the ergative system for some word orders and the accusative system for others. In the accusative phrases, the subject governs the gender, class, and number suffixes of the verb – in direct contrast to the ergative phrases.\nAdjectives always follow the noun that they describe and if there is also a number in the clause, it follows the adjective (“Three big dogs” becomes “dogs big three”). The Paumarí language has very few words that act as adverbs, but several ways of changing other words into adverbs via affixes. Adverbs do not modify adjectives in the Paumarí language.\n\nPaumarí is primarily an agglutinative language, and primarily suffixing, although many prefixes are also used. Prefixes on verbs are usually reserved for obligatory pronoun incorporation, whereas verb suffixes denote many different things. There exist affixes, mainly suffixes, to denote gender, number, and noun classes in verbs. The appropriate affixes are added to the verb to agree with the sentence’s noun (either the Subject or Object depending on whether the ergative or accusative system are being used) in each case.\n\nThere are some portions of the Paumarí language that have been irreversibly changed by Portuguese influence. For example, Paumarí use Portuguese narrative words such as \"dai\" (\"from there\") and \"então\" (\"then\") often in their speech. Also, Paumarí have difficulty expressing equality/inequality within their own language. At the time of the 1964 SIL arrival, they used the Portuguese word \"mais\" (\"more\") in conjunction with adjectives to compare things and the researchers could not find anything in native Paumarí tongue that served the same function in their language. Often, root duplication serves as a way for the Paumarí to express that something is less like or becoming or trending towards another thing. This is an odd use of reduplication, as in many other languages, reduplication serves to strengthen the word; make it more immediate or intense. For adjectives, often the suffix –\"ki\" will be added to tag the word as descriptive. Reduplication of adjective roots denotes less of the description.\n\nDan Everett of the University of North Dakota has extensively studied the accent/stress system of the Paumarí and has claimed that the Paumarí’s accent system violates some of the most basic theories put forward by linguists with regards to stress systems. Paumarí has iambic feet, which means the accent tends towards the right, or latter, portion of the word or syllable set, and they are not weight-sensitive. Everett theorizes that stress placement and syllables in the Paumarí language are more exclusive from one another than many modern theories believe. Two types of accents are distinguished in Paumarí, primary stress and secondary stress. Primary stress is characterized by a sharp increase in intensity (volume) and by somewhat higher pitch, although the latter is difficult for non-speakers to distinguish and was found by digital analysis of sound wave of native speakers. Secondary stress in Paumarí is characterized by a slight increase in intensity and often an increase in syllable duration. The final syllable of a word always has one of the two of these and therefore is always somewhat stressed. The stress system starts at the final syllable and works its way to the left, or the beginning of the word, skipping every other syllable. In disyllabic words, the primary stress is placed on the final syllable. In polysyllabic words, the primary stress is assigned to the antepenult (third from last) syllable, and the last syllable is assigned secondary stress. If the polysyllabic word is five syllables or more, every odd syllable (leftward) from the antepenult syllable is also assigned secondary stress. Therefore, regardless of how many syllables a word has, the primary stress is always on the last or antepenult syllable. The beginning syllable for a word will only have primary stress if it is a three-syllable word, and will have secondary stress only if it contains an odd-number (5, 7, 9, etc.) of syllables.\n\n"}

{"id": "2621474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2621474", "title": "Professional wrestling authority figures", "text": "Professional wrestling authority figures\n\nThis list brings together authority figures – people who hold on-screen power – in professional wrestling promotions or brands within North America. The North American wrestling industry portrays authority figures as responsible for making matches, providing rules and generally keeping law and order both in and outside the ring. The role can vary according to disposition, as a face authority figure tends to give what the fans want and does what is fair, while a heel authority figures tend to run their shows out of their own self-interest.\n\nFrom its founding in 1963 to 1997, the WWE looked to a President as an authority figure: the President had booking power and controlled all wrestlers. However, in 1997, the Commissioner replaced the President, with Sgt. Slaughter serving as the first WWE Commissioner. During the Attitude Era (1997–2002), not only the Commissioner, but also Vince McMahon (through his position as WWE Chairman under his evil character \"Mr. McMahon\") had booking power. McMahon usually used his power in order to haze his kayfabe nemesis, Stone Cold Steve Austin. When Shawn Michaels served as Commissioner, he could overrule McMahon, but he exercised his booking power only sporadically, and was working with an \"Iron-Clad\" contract where he could not be fired. When Mick Foley acquired the position, he took full reign until he was fired from the position.\n\nUpon splitting the WWE into two separate brands in the WWE brand extension of 2002, on-screen co-owners Vince McMahon and Ric Flair proceeded to draft WWE wrestlers into two separate rosters. Flair took ownership of \"Raw\", while McMahon controlled \"SmackDown!\". After McMahon regained control of the entire company, he removed Flair from control of \"Raw\", relinquished his own position and appointed separate General Managers to control the different brands.\n\nOn July 18, 2011, Triple H came to \"Raw\" and told Vince McMahon that the Board of Directors (kayfabe) revoked his \"day-to-day operation power\" and named him to manage it instead. After that, Triple H became the WWE's Chief Operating Officer who had the booking power in WWE on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" brands until the Board stripped him of his power, and named John Laurinaitis the Interim General Manager of \"Raw\".\n\n\n While Mick Foley was Commissioner in 2000, he was the ultimate on-screen authority, overriding everyone else.\n\nFrom 1996 onwards, the corporate roles of Vince McMahon and his wife Linda were gradually acknowledged in WWF programmes and were subsequently included in storylines. The following list gives the development of corporate offices as portrayed in storylines and should not be confused with their counterparts in the actual structure in WWE, Inc. and its predecessors.\n\n In real life, Linda McMahon served on the board of directors for the WWF's parent company from 1980; Vince McMahon appointed her to the position of CEO in 1994 during the WWF steroid scandal.\n\n\nThe Director of Authority operated as the on-screen authority-figure for the company.\n\nTNA Wrestling also maintained a championship committee – established in 2004 to help the Director of Authority to book matches and to keep contenders in proper order. The Committee members also served as guest judges for \"TNA Impact!\" when broadcast by Fox Sports Net, as all matches had a time limit and if the match went to time, a judge had to make the call as to who had won (somewhat as in boxing). By June 2005 the committee was dropped and only Larry Zbyszko made appearances for the company. Despite the name, the National Wrestling Alliance had no direct relationship with the committee; during its existence TNA controlled the booking of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and treated it as its foremost title.\n\nThe committee consisted of:\n\n\n Dixie Carter has been legitimately TNA President since 2003 after Panda Energy International became majority shareholder of TNA. However, Jerry Jarrett continued to appear till 2003 as President and Jeff Jarrett was recognised on screen from 2004 till 2009 when Dixie began to have the on-screen role.\n\n Hulk Hogan was (storyline) President from October 2010 to October 2011 after Carter unkowingly signed her power away to him in a contract. Carter was re-established as on-screen President following Sting defeating Hogan at Bound For Glory.\n\n\n\n\n\n MVP was also the Director of Wrestling Operations but lost his position on June 26, 2014. The investor storyline was dropped after that.\n\n\n As a result of the outcome of the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown, MVP partly took control of TNA as the (storyline) Director of Wrestling Operations.\n\n\n Was told by TNA Chairwoman & Chief Strategy Officer Dixie Carter on the September 8, 2016 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" that the decision was made by the TNA Board of Directors that as long as she has possession of the TNA Knockouts Championship, she has no decision-making authority, as her being both Knockouts Champion & Leader of the Knockouts creates a conflict of interest. Then, on the October 13, 2016 episode, lost a Title vs Knockouts Leadership match against Gail Kim, completely removing her as Leader of the Knockouts.\n\n\n\n\n Made the announcement on the June 26, 2014 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\" that MVP was stripped of his title as Director of Wrestling Operations, then later on announced Kurt Angle as MVP's replacement as Executive Director of Wrestling Operations.\n\n\n\nTed Turner purchased Jim Crockett Promotions and launched World Championship Wrestling in 1988. The company went through a series of Vice Presidents and bookers, ranging from those with little wrestling experience to those entrenched in the old territorial methods of promotion, until Eric Bischoff took control in 1994. His tenure saw the creation of \"Nitro\", the start of the Monday Night Wars, and the formation of the New World Order. Declining ratings saw Bischoff ousted in 1999, and former WWF writer Vince Russo was hired in an attempt to salvage the company. WCW was purchased by the WWF in March 2001, however the company was featured prominently on WWF television as part of the Invasion storyline for the remainder of the year.\n\n\n Shane McMahon owned WCW as part of the Invasion storyline with the rights actually owned by WWF chairman Vince McMahon.\n\n\n\n Flair became on-screen president after defeating Eric Bischoff in a match on \"Nitro\".\n\n\nRegal served as The Alliance Commissioner during the Invasion storyline.\n\n\n Upon arriving in WCW, Russo and Ferrara were introduced as \"The Powers That Be\", a mysterious on-screen presence that controlled the company.\n\n\n Bischoff returned to WCW as an unspecified authority figure on April 10, 2000 and alongside Vince Russo took control of the company as the leaders of The New Blood group.\n\n\n Stephanie McMahon owned ECW as part of the Invasion storyline with the rights actually owned by WWE chairman Vince McMahon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "511201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511201", "title": "Russification", "text": "Russification\n\nRussification (, \"Rusifikatskiya\") or Russianization is a form of cultural assimilation process during which non-Russian communities, voluntarily or not, give up their culture and language in favor of the Russian one.\n\nIn a historical sense, the term refers to both official and unofficial policies of Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union with respect to their national constituents and to national minorities in Russia, aimed at Russian domination.\n\nThe major areas of Russification are politics and culture. In politics, an element of Russification is assigning Russian nationals to leading administrative positions in national institutions. In culture, Russification primarily amounts to domination of the Russian language in official business and strong influence of the Russian language on national idioms. The shifts in demographics in favour of the ethnic Russian population are sometimes considered as a form of Russification as well.\n\nAnalytically, it is helpful to distinguish \"Russification\", as a process of changing one's ethnic self-label or identity from a non-Russian ethnonym to Russian, from \"Russianization\", the spread of the Russian language, culture, and people into non-Russian cultures and regions, distinct also from Sovietization or the imposition of institutional forms established by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union throughout the territory ruled by that party. In this sense, although Russification is usually conflated across Russification, Russianization, and Russian-led Sovietization, each can be considered a distinct process. Russianization and Sovietization, for example, did not automatically lead to Russification – change in language or self-identity of non-Russian peoples to being Russian. Thus, despite long exposure to the Russian language and culture, as well as to Sovietization, at the end of the Soviet era non-Russians were on the verge of becoming a majority of the population in the Soviet Union.\n\nAn early case of Russification took place in the 16th century in the conquered Khanate of Kazan (medieval Tatar state which occupied the territory of former Volga Bulgaria) and other Tatar areas. The main elements of this process were Christianization and implementation of the Russian language as the sole administrative language.\n\nAfter the Russian defeat in the Crimean War in 1856 and the Polish rebellion of 1863, Tsar Alexander II increased Russification to reduce the threat of future rebellions. Russia was populated by many minority groups, and forcing them to accept the Russian culture was an attempt to prevent self-determinationist tendencies and separatism. In the 19th century, Russian settlers on traditional Kirghiz land drove many of the Kirghiz over the border to China.\n\nIndigenous to large parts of western and central Russia are the Uralic peoples, such as the Vepsians, Mordvins, Maris and Permians. Historically, the Russification of Uralic peoples begins already with the original eastward expansion of the East Slavs. Written records of the oldest period are scarce, but toponymic evidence indicates that this expansion was accomplished at the expense of various Volga-Finnic peoples, who were gradually assimilated by Russians; beginning with the Merya and the Muroma in the early 2nd millennium CE.\n\nThe Russification of the Komi began in the 13th to 14th centuries, but did not penetrate into the Komi heartlands until the 18th century. Komi-Russian bilingualism has become the norm over the 19th and has led to increasing Russian influence in the Komi language.\n\nThe enforced Russification of Russia's remaining indigenous minorities has intensified particularly during the Soviet era and continues unabated in the 21st century, especially in connection to urbanization and the dropping population replacement rates (particularly low among the more western Uralic peoples). As a result, several of Russia's indigenous languages and cultures are currently considered endangered. E.g. between the 1989 and 2002 censuses, the assimilation numbers of the Mordvins have totalled over 100,000, a major loss for a people totalling less than one million in number. According to Vasily Pekteyev, director of the Mari National Theater in Yoshkar-Ola, Mari El, a policy of Russification in the republic that began in 2001 has resulted in the Mari language no longer being taught in schools and villages. By the 2010 Russian census, there were 204,000 native speakers of Mari, a drop from 254,000 in 2002.\n\nIn 19th century the Russian Empire strove to replace the Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian, and Belarusian languages and dialects by Russian in those areas, which were annexed by the Russian Empire after the Partitions of Poland (1772–1795) and the Congress of Vienna (1815). Imperial Russia faced a crucial critical cultural situation by 1815:\n\nLarge sections of Russian society had come under foreign influence as a result of the Napoleonic wars and appeared open to change. As a consequence of absorbing so much Polish territory, by 1815 no less than 64 per cent of the nobility of the Romanov realm was of Polish descent, and since there more literate Poles than Russians, more people within it could read and write Polish than Russian. The third largest city, Wilno, was entirely Polish in character and its university was the best in the Empire.\n\nRussification in Congress Poland intensified after the November Uprising of 1831, and in particular after the January Uprising of 1863. In 1864 the Polish and Belarusian languages were banned in public places; in the 1880s Polish was banned in schools, on school grounds and in the offices of Congress Poland. Research and teaching of the Polish language, of Polish history or of Catholicism were forbidden. Illiteracy rose as Poles refused to learn Russian. Students were beaten for resisting Russification. A Polish underground education network formed, including the famous Flying University. According to Russian estimates, by 1901 one-third of the inhabitants in the Congress Poland was involved in clandestine education based on Polish literature.\n\nStarting in the 1840's Russia considered introducing Cyrillic script for spelling the Polish language, with the first school books printed in the 1860s; these attempts failed.\n\nA similar development took place in Lithuania. Its Governor General, Mikhail Muravyov (in office 1863-1865), prohibited the public use of spoken Polish and Lithuanian and closed Polish and Lithuanian schools; teachers from other parts of Russia who did not speak these languages were moved in to teach pupils. Muravyov also banned the use of Latin and Gothic scripts in publishing. He was reported as saying, \"What the Russian bayonet didn't accomplish, the Russian school will.\" (\"Что не додѣлалъ русскій штыкъ – додѣлаетъ русская школа.\") This ban, lifted only in 1904, was disregarded by the \"Knygnešiai\", the Lithuanian book smugglers, who brought Lithuanian publications printed in the Latin alphabet, the historic orthography of the Lithuanian language, from Lithuania Minor (part of East Prussia) and from the United States into the Lithuanian-speaking areas of Imperial Russia. The knygnešiai came to symbolise the resistance of Lithuanians against Russification.\n\nThe Russification campaign also promoted the Russian Orthodox faith over Catholicism. The measures used included closing down Catholic monasteries, officially banning the building of new churches and giving many of the old ones to the Russian Orthodox church, banning Catholic schools and establishing state schools which taught only the Orthodox religion, requiring Catholic priests to preach only officially approved sermons, requiring that Catholics who married members of the Orthodox church convert, requiring Catholic nobles to pay an additional tax in the amount of 10% of their profits, limiting the amount of land a Catholic peasant could own, and switching from the Gregorian calendar (used by Catholics) to the Julian one (used by members of the Orthodox church).\n\nMost of the Orthodox Church property in the 19th century Congress Poland was acquired at the expense of the Catholic Church of both rites (Roman and Greek Catholic).\n\nAfter the uprising, many manors and great chunks of land were confiscated from nobles of Polish and Lithuanian descent who were accused of helping the uprising; these properties were later given or sold to Russian nobles. Villages where supporters of the uprising lived were repopulated by ethnic Russians. Vilnius University, where the language of instruction had been Polish rather than Russian, closed in 1832. Lithuanians and Poles were banned from holding any public jobs (including professional positions, such as teachers and doctors) in Lithuania; this forced educated Lithuanians to move to other parts of the Russian Empire. The old legal code was dismantled and a new one based on the Russian code and written in the Russian language was enacted; Russian became the only administrative and juridical language in the area. Most of these actions ended at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, but others took longer to be reversed; Vilnius University re-opened only after Russia had lost control of the city in 1919.\n\nRussian and Soviet authorities conducted policies of Russification of Ukraine from 1709 to 1991, interrupted by the Korenizatsiya policy in the 1920s. Since then, the Ukrainian government has implemented policies in order to decrease the use of Russian and favour Ukrainian, a process labelled Ukrainization.\n\nA number of Ukrainian activists committed suicide in protest against Russification, among whom are Oleksa Hirnyk and Vasyl Makukh.\n\nThe Russification of Finland (1899–1905, 1908–1917), \"sortokaudet\" (times of oppression in Finnish) was a governmental policy of the Russian Empire aimed at the termination of Finland's autonomy.\n\nBessarabia was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1812. In 1816 Bessarabia became an autonomous state, but only until 1828. In 1829, the use of the Romanian language was forbidden in the administration. In 1833, the use of the Romanian language was forbidden in churches. In 1842, teaching in Romanian was forbidden in secondary schools; it was forbidden in elementary schools in 1860.\n\nThe Russian authorities forced the migration of Moldovans to other provinces of the Russian Empire (especially in Kuban, Kazakhstan and Siberia), while foreign ethnic groups (especially Russians and Ukrainians, called in the 19th century \"Little Russians\") were encouraged to settle there. According to the 1817 census, Bessarabia was populated by 86% Moldovans, 6.5% Ukrainians, 1.5% Russians (Lipovans) and 6% other ethnic groups. 80 years later, in 1897, the ethnic structure was very different: only 56% Moldovans, but 11.7% Ukrainians, 18.9% Russians and 13.4% other ethnic groups. During 80 years, between 1817 and 1897, the share of Moldovan population dropped by 30%.\n\nAfter the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia in 1940, the Romanian population of Bessarabia was persecuted by Soviet authorities, especially in the years following the annexation, based mostly on social, educational, and political grounds; because of this, Russification laws were imposed again on the Romanian population. The Moldovan language introduced during the Interwar period by the Soviet authorities first in the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and after 1940 taught in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, was actually the Romanian language but written with a version of the Cyrillic script derived from the Russian alphabet. Proponents of Cyrillic orthography argue that the Romanian language was historically written with the Cyrillic script, albeit a different version of it (see Moldovan alphabet and Romanian Cyrillic alphabet for a discussion of this controversy).\n\nThe cultural and linguistic effects of Russification manifest themselves in persistent identity questions. During the breakup of the Soviet Union, this led to separation of a large and industrialized portion of the country, becoming the de facto independent state of Transnistria, whose main official language is Russian.\n\nAfter the 1917 revolution, authorities in the USSR decided to abolish the use of the Arabic alphabet in native languages in Soviet-controlled Central Asia, in the Caucasus, and in the Volga region (including Tatarstan). This detached the local Muslim populations from exposure to the language and writing system of the Koran. The new alphabet for these languages was based on the Latin alphabet and was also inspired by the Turkish alphabet. However, by the late 1930s, the policy had changed. In 1939–1940 the Soviets decided that a number of these languages (including Tatar, Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Azeri, and Bashkir) would henceforth use variations of the Cyrillic script. It was claimed that the switch was made \"by the demands of the working class.\"\n\nStalin's \"Marxism and the National Question\" (1913) provided the basic framework for nationality policy in the Soviet Union. The early years of said policy, from the early 1920s to the mid-1930s, were guided by the policy of korenizatsiya (\"indigenization\"), during which the new Soviet regime sought to reverse the long-term effects of Russification on the non-Russian populations. As the regime was trying to establish its power and legitimacy throughout the former Russian empire, it went about constructing regional administrative units, recruiting non-Russians into leadership positions, and promoting non-Russian languages in government administration, the courts, the schools, and the mass media. The slogan then established was that local cultures should be \"socialist in content but national in form.\" That is, these cultures should be transformed to conform with the Communist Party's socialist project for the Soviet society as a whole but have active participation and leadership by the indigenous nationalities and operate primarily in the local languages.\n\nEarly nationalities policy shared with later policy the object of assuring control by the Communist Party over all aspects of Soviet political, economic, and social life. The early Soviet policy of promoting what one scholar has described as \"ethnic particularism\" and another as \"institutionalized multinationality\", had a double goal. On the one hand, it had been an effort to counter Russian chauvinism by assuring a place for the non-Russian languages and cultures in the newly formed Soviet Union. On the other hand, it was a means to prevent the formation of alternative ethnically based political movements, including pan-Islamism and pan-Turkism. One way of accomplishing this was to promote what some regard as artificial distinctions between ethnic groups and languages rather than promoting amalgamation of these groups and a common set of languages based on Turkish or another regional language.\n\nThe Soviet nationalities policy from its early years sought to counter these two tendencies by assuring a modicum of cultural autonomy to non-Russian nationalities within a federal system or structure of government, though maintaining that the ruling Communist Party was monolithic, not federal. A process of \"national-territorial delimitation\" () was undertaken to define the official territories of the non-Russian populations within the Soviet Union. The federal system conferred highest status to the titular nationalities of union republics, and lower status to titular nationalities of autonomous republics, autonomous provinces, and autonomous okrugs. In all, some 50 nationalities had a republic, province, or okrug of which they held nominal control in the federal system. Federalism and the provision of native-language education ultimately left as a legacy a large non-Russian public that was educated in the languages of their ethnic groups and that identified a particular homeland on the territory of the Soviet Union.\n\nBy the late 1930s, however, there was a notable policy shift. Purges in some of the national regions, such as Ukraine, had occurred already in the early 1930s. Before the turnabout in Ukraine in 1933, a purge of Veli Ibrahimov and his leadership in the Crimean ASSR in 1929 for \"national deviation\" led to Russianization of government, education, and the media and to the creation of a special alphabet for Crimean Tatar to replace the Latin alphabet. Of the two dangers that Joseph Stalin had identified in 1923, now bourgeois nationalism (local nationalism) was said to be a greater threat than Great Russian chauvinism (great power chauvinism). In 1937, Faizullah Khojaev and Akmal Ikramov were removed as leaders of the Uzbek SSR and in 1938, during the third great Moscow show trial, convicted and subsequently put to death for alleged anti-Soviet nationalist activities.\n\nAfter Stalin, a Russified Georgian, became undisputed leader of the Soviet Union, the Russian language gained greater emphasis. In 1938, Russian became a required subject of study in every Soviet school, including those in which a non-Russian language was the principal medium of instruction for other subjects (e.g., mathematics, science, and social studies). In 1939, non-Russian languages that had been given Latin-based scripts in the late 1920s were given new scripts based on the Cyrillic script. One likely rationale for these decisions was the sense of impending war and that Russian was the language of command in the Red Army.\n\nBefore and during World War II, Joseph Stalin deported to Central Asia and Siberia several entire nationalities for their suspected collaboration with the German invaders: Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, Ingush, Balkars, Kalmyks, and others. Shortly after the war, he deported many Ukrainians, Balts and Estonians to Siberia as well.\n\nAfter the war, the leading role of the Russian people in the Soviet family of nations and nationalities was promoted by Stalin and his successors. This shift was most clearly underscored by Communist Party General Secretary Stalin's Victory Day toast to the Russian people in May 1945:\n\nNaming the Russian nation the primus inter pares was a total turnabout from Stalin's declaration 20 years earlier (heralding the korenizatsiya policy) that \"the first immediate task of our Party is vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism.\" Although the official literature on nationalities and languages in subsequent years continued to speak of there being 130 equal languages in the USSR, in practice a hierarchy was endorsed in which some nationalities and languages were given special roles or viewed as having different long-term futures.\n\nAn analysis of textbook publishing found that education was offered for at least one year and for at least the first class (grade) in 67 languages between 1934 and 1980. However, the educational reforms undertaken after Nikita Khrushchev became First Secretary of the Communist Party in the late 1950s began a process of replacing non-Russian schools with Russian ones for the nationalities that had lower status in the federal system or whose populations were smaller or displayed widespread bilingualism already. Nominally, this process was guided by the principle of \"voluntary parental choice.\" But other factors also came into play, including the size and formal political status of the group in the Soviet federal hierarchy and the prevailing level of bilingualism among parents. By the early 1970s schools in which non-Russian languages served as the principal medium of instruction operated in 45 languages, while seven more indigenous languages were taught as subjects of study for at least one class year. By 1980, instruction was offered in 35 non-Russian languages of the peoples of the USSR, just over half the number in the early 1930's.\n\nMoreover, in most of these languages schooling was not offered for the complete 10-year curriculum. For example, within the RSFSR in 1958–59, full 10-year schooling in the native language was offered in only three languages: Russian, Tatar, and Bashkir. And some nationalities had minimal or no native-language schooling. By 1962–1963, among non-Russian nationalities that were indigenous to the RSFSR, whereas 27% of children in classes I-IV (primary school) studied in Russian-language schools, 53% of those in classes V-VIII (incomplete secondary school) studied in Russian-language schools, and 66% of those in classes IX-X studied in Russian-language schools. Although many non-Russian languages were still offered as a subject of study at a higher class level (in some cases through complete general secondary school – the 10th class), the pattern of using the Russian language as the main medium of instruction accelerated after Khrushchev's parental choice program got under way.\n\nPressure to convert the main medium of instruction to Russian was evidently higher in urban areas. For example, in 1961–62, reportedly only 6% of Tatar children living in urban areas attended schools in which Tatar was the main medium of instruction. Similarly in Dagestan in 1965, schools in which the indigenous language was the medium of instruction existed only in rural areas. The pattern was probably similar, if less extreme, in most of the non-Russian union republics, although in Belarus and Ukraine schooling in urban areas was highly Russianized.\n\nThe promotion of federalism and of non-Russian languages had always been a strategic decision aimed at expanding and maintaining rule by the Communist Party. On the theoretical plane, however, the Communist Party's official doctrine was that eventually nationality differences and nationalities as such would disappear. In official party doctrine as it was reformulated in the Third Program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union introduced by Nikita Khrushchev at the 22nd Party Congress in 1961, although the program stated that ethnic distinctions would eventually disappear and a single common language would be adopted by all nationalities in the Soviet Union, \"the obliteration of national distinctions, and especially language distinctions, is a considerably more drawn-out process than the obliteration of class distinctions.\" At that time, however, Soviet nations and nationalities were undergoing a dual process of further flowering of their cultures and of rapprochement or drawing together (сближение – sblizhenie) into a stronger union. In his Report on the Program to the Congress, Khrushchev used even stronger language: that the process of further rapprochement (sblizhenie) and greater unity of nations would eventually lead to a merging or fusion (слияние – sliyanie) of nationalities.\n\nKhrushchev's formula of rapprochement-fusing was moderated slightly, however, when Leonid Brezhnev replaced Khrushchev as General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1964 (a post he held until his death in 1982). Brezhnev asserted that rapproachment would lead ultimately to the complete \"unity\" of nationalities. \"Unity\" was an ambiguous term because it could imply either the maintenance of separate national identities but a higher stage of mutual attraction or similarity between nationalities, or the total disappearance of ethnic differences. In the political context of the time, \"rapproahment-unity\" was regarded as a softening of the pressure towards Russification that Khrushchev had promoted with his endorsement of sliyanie.\n\nThe 24th Party Congress in 1971, however, launched the idea that a new \"Soviet people\" was forming on the territory of the USSR, a community for which the common language – the language of the \"Soviet people\" – was the Russian language, consistent with the role that Russian was playing for the fraternal nations and nationalities in the territory already. This new community was labeled a people (народ – \"narod\"), not a nation (нация – \"natsiya\"), but in that context the Russian word \"narod\" (\"people\") implied an \"ethnic\" community, not just a civic or political community.\n\nThus, until the end of the Soviet era, a doctrinal rationalization had been provided for some of the practical policy steps that were taken in areas of education and the media. First of all, the transfer of many \"national schools\" (schools based on local languages) to Russian as a medium of instruction accelerated under Khrushchev in the late 1950s and continued into the 1980s.\n\nSecond, the new doctrine was used to justify the special place of the Russian language as the \"language of inter-nationality communication\" (язык межнационального общения) in the USSR. Use of the term \"inter-nationality\" (межнациональное) rather than the more conventional \"international\" (международное) focused on the special \"internal\" role of Russian language rather than on its role as a language of international discourse. That Russian was the most widely spoken language, and that Russians were the majority of the population of the country, were also cited in justification of the special place of Russian language in government, education, and the media.\n\nAt the 27th CPSU Party Congress in 1986, presided over by Mikhail Gorbachev, the 4th Party Program reiterated the formulas of the previous program:\n\nProgress in the spread of Russian language as a second language and the gradual displacement of other languages was monitored in Soviet censuses. The Soviet censuses of 1926, 1937, 1939, and 1959, had included questions on \"native language\" (родной язык) as well as \"nationality.\" The 1970, 1979, and 1989 censuses added to these questions one on \"other language of the peoples of the USSR\" that an individual could \"use fluently\" (свободно владеть). It is speculated that the explicit goal of the new question on \"second language\" was to monitor the spread of Russian as the language of internationality communication.\n\nEach of the official homelands within the Soviet Union was regarded as the only homeland of the titular nationality and its language, while the Russian language was regarded as the language for interethnic communication for the whole Soviet Union. Therefore, for most of the Soviet era, especially after the korenizatsiya (indigenization) policy ended in the 1930s, schools in which non-Russian Soviet languages would be taught were not generally available outside the respective ethnically based administrative units of these ethnicities. Some exceptions appeared to involve cases of historic rivalries or patterns of assimilation between neighboring non-Russian groups, such as between Tatars and Bashkirs in Russia or among major Central Asian nationalities. For example, even in the 1970s schooling was offered in at least seven languages in Uzbekistan: Russian, Uzbek, Tajik, Kazakh, Turkmen, Kyrgyz, and Karakalpak.\n\nWhile formally all languages were equal, in almost all Soviet republics the Russian/local bilingualism was \"asymmetric\": the titular nation learned Russian, whereas immigrant Russians generally did not learn the local language.\n\nIn addition, many non-Russians who lived outside their respective administrative units tended to become Russified linguistically; that is, they not only learned Russian as a second language but they also adopted it as their home language or mother tongue – although some still retained their sense of \"ethnic\" identity or origins even after shifting their native language to Russian. This includes both the traditional communities (e.g., Lithuanians in the northwestern Belarus (\"see Eastern Vilnius region\") or the Kaliningrad Oblast (\"see Lithuania Minor\")) and the communities that appeared during Soviet times such as Ukrainian or Belarusian workers in Kazakhstan or Latvia, whose children attended primarily the Russian-language schools and thus the further generations are primarily speaking Russian as their native language; for example, 57% of Estonia's Ukrainians, 70% of Estonia's Belarusians and 37% of Estonia's Latvians claimed Russian as the native language in the last Soviet census of 1989. Russian language as well replaced Yiddish and other languages as the main language of many Jewish communities inside the Soviet Union.\n\nAnother consequence of the mixing of nationalities and the spread of bilingualism and linguistic Russification was the growth of ethnic intermarriage and a process of \"ethnic\" Russification—coming to call oneself Russian by nationality or ethnicity, not just speaking Russian as a second language or using it as a primary language. In the last decades of the Soviet Union, ethnic Russification (or ethnic assimilation) was moving very rapidly for a few nationalities such as the Karelians and Mordvinians. However, whether children born in mixed families where one of the parents was Russian were likely to be raised as Russians depended on the context. For example, the majority of children in families where one parent was Russian and the other Ukrainian living in North Kazakhstan chose Russian as their nationality on their internal passport at age 16. However, children of mixed Russian and Estonian parents living in Tallinn (the capital city of Estonia), or mixed Russian and Latvian parents living in Riga (the capital of Latvia), or mixed Russian and Lithuanian parents living in Vilnius (the capital of Lithuania) most often chose as their own nationality that of the titular nationality of their republic – not Russian.\n\nMore generally, patterns of linguistic and ethnic assimilation (Russification) were complex and cannot be accounted for by any single factor such as educational policy. Also relevant were the traditional cultures and religions of the groups, their residence in urban or rural areas, their contact with and exposure to Russian language and to ethnic Russians, and other factors.\n\nOn June 19, 2018, the Russian Duma adopted a bill that made education in all languages but Russian optional, overruling previous laws by ethnic autonomies, and reducing instruction in minority languages to only two hours a week. This bill has been connected by some commentators, such as in \"Foreign Affairs\" to a policy of Russification. When the bill was still being considered, advocates for minorities warned that the bill could endanger their languages and traditional cultures. The law came after a lawsuit in the summer of 2017, where a Russian mother claimed that her son had been \"materially harmed\" by learning the Tatar language, while in a speech Putin argued that it was wrong to force someone to learn a langauge that is not their own. The later \"language crackdown\" in which autonomous units were forced to stop mandatory hours of native languages was also seen as a move by Putin to \"build identity in Russian society\".\n\nProtests and petitions against the bill by either civic society, groups of public intellectuals or regional governments came from Tatarstan (with attempts for demonstrations suppressed) , Chuvashia, Mari El, North Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, the Karachays, the Kumyks, the Avars, Chechnya and Ingushetia. Although the \"hand-picked\" Duma representatives from the Caucasus did not oppose the bill, it prompted a large outcry in the North Caucasus with representatives from the region being accused of cowardice. The law was also seen as possibly destabilizing, threatening ethnic relations and revitalizing the various North Caucasian nationalist movements. The International Circassian Organization called for the law to be rescinded before it came into effect. Twelve of Russia's ethnic autonomies, including five in the Caucasus called for the legislation to be blocked.\n\nIn the North Caucasus, the law came after a decade in which educational opportunities in the indigenous languages was by more than 50%, due to budget reductions and federal efforts to decrease the role of languages other than Russian. During this period, numerous indigenous languages in the North Caucasus showed significant decreases in their numbers of speakers even though the numbers of the corresponding nationalities increased, leading to fears of language replacement. The numbers of Ossetian, Kumyk and Avar speakers dropped by 43,000, 63,000 and 80,000 respectively. As of 2018, it has been reported that the North Caucasus is nearly devoid of schools that teach in mainly their native languages, with the exception of one school in North Ossetia, and a few in rural regions of Dagestan; this is true even in largely monoethnic Chechnya and Ingushetia. Chechen and Ingush are still used as languages of everyday communication to a greater degree than their North Caucasian neighbours, but sociolinguistics argue that the current situation will lead to their degradation relative to Russian as well.\n\n\n"}

In classical Indo-European verse, as developed in Greek, Sanskrit, and Latin, distinctions of syllable weight were fundamental to the meter of the line.\n\nA heavy syllable is a syllable with a branching nucleus or a branching rime, although not all such syllables are heavy in every language. A branching nucleus generally means the syllable has a long vowel or a diphthong; this type of syllable is abbreviated CVV. A syllable with a branching rime is a \"closed syllable\", that is, one with a coda (one or more consonants at the end of the syllable); this type of syllable is abbreviated CVC. In some languages, both CVV and CVC syllables are heavy, while a syllable with a short vowel as the nucleus and no coda (a CV syllable) is a light syllable. In other languages, only CVV syllables are heavy, while CVC and CV syllables are light. In yet other languages, CVV syllables are heavy and CV syllables are light, while some CVC syllables are heavy (for instance if the coda is a sonorant) and other CVC syllables are light (for instance if the coda is an obstruent). Some languages distinguish a third type, CVVC syllables (with both a branching nucleus and a coda) and/or CVCC syllables (with a coda consisting of two or more consonants) as superheavy syllables.\n\nIn moraic theory, heavy syllables are analyzed as containing two morae, light syllables one, and superheavy syllables three.\n\nThe distinction between heavy and light syllables plays an important role in the phonology of some languages, especially with regard to the assignment of stress. For instance, in the Sezer stress pattern in Turkish observed in place names, the main stress occurs as an iamb (i.e. penultimate stress) one syllable to the left of the final syllable: (L'L)σ. However, when the foot contains a heavy syllable in the first syllable while the second syllable is light, the iamb shifts to a trochee (i.e. antepenultimate stress) because there is a requirement that main stress fall on a heavy syllable whenever possible: ('HL)σ, and not *(H'L)σ.\n\nIn Ancient Greek hexameter poetry and Latin literature, lines followed certain metrical patterns, such as based on arrangements of heavy and light syllables. A heavy syllable was referred to as a ' and a light as a ' (and in the modern day, reflecting the ancient terms, a is often called a \"long syllable\" and a a \"short syllable\", potentially creating confusion between syllable length and vowel length).\n\nA syllable was considered heavy if it contained a long vowel or a diphthong (and was therefore \"long by nature\" — it would be long no matter what) or if it contained a short vowel that was followed by more than one consonant (\"long by position\", long by virtue of its relationship to the consonants following).\nAn example:\n\nThe first syllable of the first word (') is heavy (\"long by position\") because it contains a short vowel (the A) followed by more than one consonant (R and then M) — and if not for the consonants coming after it, it would be light. The second syllable is light because it contains a short vowel (an A) followed immediately by only one consonant (the V). The next syllable is light for the same reason. The next syllable, the second syllable of the word ', is heavy (\"long by position\") because it contains a short vowel followed by more than one consonant (the M and then the Q).\n\nBut, for example, the first syllable of the word ' is heavy (\"long by nature\") because it contains a diphthong, regardless of the sounds coming after it. Likewise, the first syllable of the second line (the first of the word ') is heavy (\"long by nature\") because it contains a long vowel, and it will be heavy no matter what sounds come after.\n\nTerming a syllable \"long by position\" is equivalent to noting that the syllable ends with a consonant (a closed syllable), because Latin and Greek speakers in the classical era pronounced a consonant as part of a preceding syllable only when it was followed by other consonants, due to the rules of Greek and Latin syllabification. In a consonant cluster, one consonant ends the preceding syllable and the rest start the following syllable. For example, Latin syllabifies ' as ' but ' as ' and ' as '.\n\nA few exceptions to and elaborations of the above rules of heavy and light syllables:\n\nAs noted above, the number and order of heavy and light syllables in a line of poetry (together with word breaks) articulated the meter of the line, such as the most famous classical meter, the epic dactylic hexameter.\n\n\n"}
