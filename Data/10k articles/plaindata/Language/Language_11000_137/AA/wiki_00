During World War I, his family moved to Omsk, Siberia, where his father, Hertz Sutzkever, died. In 1921, his mother, Rayne (née Fainberg), moved the family to Vilnius, where Sutzkever attended cheder.\n\nSutzkever attended the Polish Jewish high school Herzliah, audited university classes in Polish literature, and was introduced by a friend to Russian poetry. His earliest poems were written in Hebrew.\n\nIn 1930 Sutzkever joined the Jewish scouting organization, Bin (\"Bee\"), in whose magazine he published his first piece. There he also met with wife Freydke.\nIn 1933, he became part of the writers’ and artists’ group Yung-Vilne, along with fellow poets Shmerke Kaczerginski, Chaim Grade, and Leyzer Volf. \n\nHe married Freydke in 1939, a day before the start of World War II. \n\nIn 1941, following the Nazi occupation of Vilnius, Sutzkever and his wife were sent to the Vilna Ghetto. Sutzkever and his friends hid a diary by Theodor Herzl, drawings by Marc Chagall and Alexander Bogen, and other treasured works behind plaster and brick walls in the ghetto. His mother and newborn son were murdered by the Nazis. On September 12, 1943, he and his wife escaped to the forests, and together with fellow Yiddish poet Shmerke Kaczerginski, he fought the occupying forces as a partisan. Sutzkever joined a Jewish unit and was smuggled into the Soviet Union.\n\nSutzkever's 1943 narrative poem, Kol Nidre, reached the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in Moscow, whose members included Ilya Ehrenburg and Boris Pasternak, as well as the exiled future president of Soviet Lithuania, Justas Paleckis. They implored the Kremlin to rescue him. So an aircraft located Sutzkever and Freydke in March 1944, and flew them to Moscow, where their daughter, Rina, was born.\n\nIn February 1946, he was called up as a witness at the Nuremberg trials, testifying against Franz Murer, the murderer of his mother and son. After a brief sojourn in Poland and Paris, he emigrated to Mandatory Palestine, arriving in Tel Aviv in 1947.\n\nIn 1947, his family arrived in Tel Aviv. Within two years Sutzkever founded Di Goldene Keyt (The Golden Chain)\"\n\nSutzkever was a keen traveller, touring South American jungles and African savannahs, where the sight of elephants and the song of a Basotho chief inspired more Yiddish verse.\n\nBelatedly, in 1985 Sutzkever became the first Yiddish writer to win the prestigious Israel Prize for his literature. An English compendium appeared in 1991.\n\nFreydke died in 2003. Rina and another daughter, Mira, survive him, along with two grandchildren. \n\nAbraham Sutzkever died on January 20, 2010, in Tel Aviv at the age of 96.\n\nSutzkever wrote poetry from an early age, initially in Hebrew. He published his first poem in \"Bin\", the Jewish scouts magazine. Sutzkever was among the Modernist writers and artists of the \"Yung Vilne\" (\"Young Vilna\") group in the early 1930s. In 1937, his first volume of Yiddish poetry, \"Lider\" (Songs), was published by the Yiddish PEN International Club; a second, \"Valdiks\" (Of the Forest; 1940), appeared after he moved from Warsaw, during the interval of Lithuanian autonomy.\n\nIn Moscow, he wrote a chronicle of his experiences in the Vilna ghetto (\"Fun vilner geto\",1946), a poetry collection \"Lider fun geto\" (1946; “Songs from the Ghetto”) and began \"Geheymshtot\" (\"Secret City\",1948), an epic poem about Jews hiding in the sewers of Vilna.\n\n\nIn 1949, Sutzkever founded the yiddish literary quarterly \"Di goldene keyt\" (The Golden Chain), Israel's only Yiddish literary quarterly, which he edited until its demise in 1995. Sutzkever resuscitated the careers of Yiddish writers from Europe, the Americas, the Soviet Union and Israel. Official Zionism, however, dismissed Yiddish as a defeatist diaspora argot. \"They will not uproot my tongue,\" he retorted. \"I shall wake all generations with my roar.\"\n\nSutzkever's poetry was translated into Hebrew by Nathan Alterman, Avraham Shlonsky and Leah Goldberg. In the 1930s, his work was translated into Russian by Boris Pasternak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their traditional ruler is the Emir of Bade. Similar to many other Western African languages, Bade is a vulnerable language at great risk of extinction. With 250,000 speakers, the language and the culture of the Bade people have suffered over the last several years. As the language continues to fade, the culture and historic value associated with the language perishes as well. The local dialect is shifting from Bade to Hausa. Across West Africa, the impact on local communities through the loss of the indigenous tongues will be significant. The endangerment of the Bade language represents the worldwide language diversity that is at risk. Many African languages have only received little linguistic attention, impacting these African languages.\n\nBade is classified under the following categories: Afro-Asiatic, Chadic, West, B, B.1, Bade Proper.\n\nBade is an African language that is currently spoken in Nigeria. While historical information about the Bade language is limited in scope, many words in the Bade language take root in the Kanuri language. The Kanuri language is primarily spoken in West Africa, including: Nigeria and Chad. Bade and Ngizim have borrowed a number of words from the Kanuri language. The Bade language itself originates from the Badr of Yemen and the Prophet Muhammad purportedly drove the Bade people out after a failure to pray. Currently, as one of the many Nigerian endangered languages, bade serves as a local dialect. In general, Nigerian languages comprise the wealth of linguistic diversity that exists in the country. Over the years, colonization has also played a role in the deteroriation of local languages.\n\nThe speakers of the Bade language are centered in Nigeria. It is spoken in the northern part of Yobe State, Nigeria.\n\nThe language is not the official language of Nigeria or any other country.\n\nThere are three dialects of the Bade language that coincide with regions, including the following: \n\nMost West Chadic languages have a similar consonant inventory separated into eight major groups: labialized laryngeal, laryngeal, labialized velar, velar, lateral, alveopalatal, alveolar, and labial. In the Bade/Ngizim languages, the glottal stop plays no role, but the vowel hiatus relies on elision and coalescence. The sounds also feature a \"yawning\" and has a shift from fricative to stop.\n\nThe grammar for the Bade language is consistent with the Ngizim language.\n\nThe Bade/Ngizim languages slightly differ from other Chadic languages. Bade and Ngizim have long vowels in closed syllables. Mid vowels also have a restricted use compared to other vowels. Mid vowels will rather appear as loanwords from other languages. The language preserves diphthongs in both native and loanwords.\n\nThe Bade language has a strong root in the Kanuri langage. There are many loanwords from Kanuri to West Chadi languages, including Bade. Bade is commonly grouped with the Ngizim language. As an example, the word 'healthy' is 'nga' in the Kanuri language and 'ngā' in the Ngizim language. More recently, the Hausa language has influenced the Bade language.\n\nThe Bade language uses a Latin script writing script. The Latin script is the most widely used writing system in the world, serving as the system for the English language as well.\n\n"}

Though he alludes to the future pope, Clement VII, as his protector, he left Rome to enter the household of Fabrizio Colonna at Naples as a chaplain where his works were printed under the title of \"Propaladia\" (1517). He is conjectured to have returned to his native place, and to have died there shortly after 1529.\n\nHis \"Diálogo del nacimiento\" is written in unavowed, though obvious, imitation of other Leonese language writers as Juan del Encina, but in his subsequent plays he shows a much larger conception of dramatic possibilities. He classifies his pieces as \"comedias á noticia\" and \"comedias á fantasía\"; the former, of which the \"Soldatesca\" and \"Tinellaria\" are examples, present in dramatic form incidents within his personal experience; the latter, which include such plays as \"Serafina, Himenea, Calamita\" and \"Aquilana\", present imaginary episodes with adroitness and persuasiveness.\n\nAccording to an evaluation in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica:\nOnly one complete copy of the \"Propaladia\" is known to exist. This book was stolen from the Royal Danish Library in the seventies and was not seen again until it turned up at an auction at Christie's in 2003 where relatives of the original thief tried to sell it.\n"}

{"id": "23276962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23276962", "title": "Cognitive semiotics", "text": "Cognitive semiotics\n\nCognitive semiotics is the study model of meaning-making, applying methods and theories from semiotics, linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, computational modeling, anthropology, philosophy and other sciences. Contrary to classical cognitive science, cognitive semiotics is explicitly involved with questions of meaning, having recourse, when possible, to semiotic terminology, although developing it when necessary. As against classical semiotics, cognitive semiotics aims to incorporate the results of other sciences, using methods ranging from conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental and ethnographic investigations.\n\nCognitive semiotics has many sources. The first person to suggest the integration of the cognitive sciences and semiotics seems to have been Thomas C. Daddesio (1994). The Argentinean researcher Juan Magariños de Morentin has long been using the term \"cognitive semiotics\" to describe his own Peircean approach to semiotics (missing direct reference dating first time using \"cognitive semiotics\"). This is also the name of a web forum which he directed for many years. Several other prominent semioticians have been known to subscribe to a cognitive approach, such as Irene Mittelberg in gesture studies and Jean-Marie Klinkenberg in pictorial semiotics. \n\nPer Aage Brandt founded a Center for Semiotics in 1995 at Aarhus University and subsequently a Master Education in Cognitive Semiotics, to investigate the connections between semiotics and cognitive science (with a strong focus on cognitive linguistics), and he has had several followers along this line such as Line Brandt (Center for Semiotics at Aarhus University), and Todd Oakley (Case Western Reserve University). The Center for Semiotics is currently constituted by Frederik Stjernfelt, Peer Bundgaard, Mikkel Wallentin, Svend Østergaard, Riccardo Fusaroli and Kristian Tylén. Bundgaard published an anthology in Danish which brings together texts from cognitive science, cognitive linguistics, and semiotics. Stjernfelt has combined the inspiration from Peirce with that from Husserl. Wallentin is conducting neuro-imaging investigations. Tylén and Fusaroli develop behavioral and neuroscientific experimental approaches to sign usage and linguistic conversations.\n\nSince 2009, there is also a Centre for Cognitive Semiotics (CCS) at Lund University (Sweden), which is headed by Göran Sonesson, who has long been working in the direction of cognitive semiotics, integrating semiotic theory with experimental studies, mainly with application to the study of pictures. Sonesson started collaborating with the linguist Jordan Zlatev around 2001 and organized a number of research project together with him, before adopting the label \"cognitive semiotics\". Other members of the CCS are, notably, Mats Andrén, who has published a number of gesture studies, partially in collaboration with Zlatev, and Sara Lenninger, who is working with Sonesson on the semiotics of pictures. The particular direction taken by cognitive semiotics in Lund consists in experimental studies which are geared to elucidate fundamental semiotic concepts such as sign, index, icon, etc., as well as their precursor notion such as imitation, mimesis, empathy and intersubjectivity. The research at CCS centers on the phylogeny and ontogeny of human semiosis, employing apes and children, respectively, as research subjects.\n\nAn international journal on cognitive semiotics, (Journal of) Cognitive Semiotics (JCS) – Multidisciplinary Journal on Meaning and Mind, was started in Denmark in 2005. Its inaugural issue, edited by Lars Andreassen, Line Brandt and Jes Vang, was published in 2007 (spring). In the fall of 2007, the first peer-reviewed issue, a theme issue on ‘Consciousness & Semiosis’ (eds. Per Aage Brandt and Jakob Simonsen), was published, with funding from Case Western Reserve University. The editorial board consisted of Line Brandt, Per Aage Brandt, Frank Kjørup, Todd Oakley, Jacob Orquin, Jakob Simonsen and Jes Vang. Since then, many issues have been published, in part by Peter Lang, and in part online, available from the journal web site. From 2014, the journal has been published by Mouton de Gruyter. The present board consists of Peer Bundgaard, Göran Sonesson, Todd Oakley, Merlin Donald, and Bruno Gantolucci.\n\nThe journal's website states: \"The first of its kind, Cognitive Semiotics is a multidisciplinary journal devoted to high quality research, integrating methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive science with methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with the ultimate aim of providing new insights into the realm of human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices.\" \n\nThe International Association for Cognitive Semiotics (IACS) was initiated during the conference of the Nordic Association for Semiotics Studies (NASS) in Lund in 2011, and officially founded during the conference of NASS in Aarhus in May 2013. The Journal of Cognitive Semiotics then became the official organ of the IACS. The first official conference of IACS took place in Lund in 2014, and the second conference was organized in Lublin in 2014. Selected papers from the Lund conference were published at Peter Lang at the end of 2016 (https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/22221), and the acts of the Lublin conference will appear as a thematic issue of the journal \"Philosophy and Science”, published by the Polish Academy of Sciences. \n\n\"Cognitive Semiotics of Film\" is a monograph written by Warren S. Buckland. Within the monograph, Warren Buckland argues that the conflict between cognitive film theory and contemporary film theory is unproductive. Cognitive semiotics of film is a neglected branch of film theory that works together with the terms linguistics and semiotics. Cognitive science is also incorporated in a combination with linguistics and semiotics to form what is called cognitive semiotics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8474825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8474825", "title": "Cranial vault", "text": "Cranial vault\n\nThe cranial vault is the space in the skull within the neurocranium, occupied by the brain. In humans, the size and shape of the brain, may be affected by the size of the vault as shown in craniometry, but studies relating it to intelligence have found no conclusive evidence. The vault is alternatively called \"skullcap\" or even calvaria, though these properly refer to the upper portion of the skull only.\n\nIn humans, the cranial vault is imperfectly composed in newborns, to allow the large human head to pass through the birth canal. During birth, the various bones connected by cartilage and ligaments only will move relatively to each other. The open portion between the major bones of the upper part of the vault, called fontanelles, normally remain soft up to two years after birth. \n\nAs the fontanelles close, the vault loses some of its plasticity. The sutures between the bones remain until 30 to 40 years of age, allowing for growth of the brain. Cranial vault size is directly proportional to skull size and is developed early.\n\nThe size and shape of the brain and the surrounding vault remain quite plastic as the brain grows in childhood. In several ancient societies, head shape was altered for aesthetic or religious reasons by binding cloth or boards tightly around the head during infancy. It is not known whether such artificial cranial deformation has an effect in mental capacity.\n\nThe cranial vault is composed of the endocranium forming the basal parts, topped by the skull roof in land vertebrates.\n\nIn fishes no distinct cranial vault as such exists, the skull being composed of loosely jointed bones. The cranial vault as a distinct unit arose with the fusion of the skull roof and the endocranium on the early Labyrinthodonts. In amphibians and reptiles the vault is rather small and inconspicuous, only forming proper vaults in mammals and birds.\n\n"}
{"id": "53716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53716", "title": "DV", "text": "DV\n\nDV is a format for storing digital video.\n\nIt was launched in 1995 with joint efforts of leading producers of video camera recorders.\n\nThe original DV specification, known as \"Blue Book\", was standardized within the IEC 61834 family of standards. These standards define common features such as physical videocassettes, recording modulation method, magnetization, and basic system data in part 1. Part 2 describes the specifics of 525-60 and 625-50 systems. The IEC standards are available as publications sold by IEC and ANSI.\n\nIn 2003, DV was joined by a successor format HDV, which used the same tape format with a different video codec. Some cameras at the time had the ability to switch between DV and HDV recording modes.\n\nAll tape-based video formats are becoming increasingly obsolete as tapeless HD cameras recording on memory cards, hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and optical discs have become the norm, although the DV encoding standard is sometimes still used in tapeless cameras.\n\nDV uses lossy compression of video while audio is stored uncompressed. An intraframe video compression scheme is used to compress video on a frame-by-frame basis with the discrete cosine transform (DCT).\n\nClosely following ITU-R Rec. 601 standard, DV video employs interlaced scanning with the luminance sampling frequency of 13.5 MHz. These results in 480 scanlines per complete frame for the 60 Hz system, and 576 scanlines per complete frame for the 50 Hz system. In both systems the active area contains 720 pixels per scanline, with 704 pixels used for content and 16 pixels on the sides left for digital blanking. The same frame size is used for 4:3 and 16:9 frame aspect ratios, resulting in different pixel aspect ratios for \"fullscreen\" and \"widescreen\" video.\n\nPrior to the DCT compression stage, chroma subsampling is applied to the source video in order to reduce the amount of data to be compressed. Baseline DV uses 4:1:1 subsampling in its 60 Hz variant and 4:2:0 subsampling in the 50 Hz variant. Low chroma resolution of DV (compared to higher-end digital video formats) is a reason this format is sometimes avoided in chroma keying applications, though advances in chroma keying techniques and software have made producing quality keys from DV material possible.\n\nAudio can be stored in either of two forms: 16-bit Linear PCM stereo at 48 kHz sampling rate (768 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 Mbit/s stereo), or four nonlinear 12-bit PCM channels at 32 kHz sampling rate (384 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 MBit/s for four channels). In addition, the DV specification also supports 16-bit audio at 44.1 kHz (706 kbit/s per channel, 1.4 Mbit/s stereo), the same sampling rate used for CD audio. In practice, the 48 kHz stereo mode is used almost exclusively.\n\nThe audio, video, and metadata are packaged into 80-byte Digital Interface Format (DIF) blocks which are multiplexed into a 150-block sequence. DIF blocks are the basic units of DV streams and can be stored as computer files in raw form or wrapped in such file formats as Audio Video Interleave (AVI), QuickTime (QT) and Material Exchange Format (MXF). One video frame is formed from either 10 or 12 such sequences, depending on scanning rate, which results in a data rate of about 25 Mbit/s for video, and an additional 1.5 Mbit/s for audio. When written to tape, each sequence corresponds to one complete track.\n\nBaseline DV employs \"unlocked audio\". This means that the sound may be +/- ⅓ frame out of sync with the video. However, this is the maximum drift of the audio/video synchronization; it is not compounded throughout the recording.\n\nSony and Panasonic created their proprietary versions of DV aimed toward professional & broadcast users, which use the same compression scheme, but improve on robustness, linear editing capabilities, color rendition and raster size.\n\nAll DV variants except for DVCPRO Progressive are recorded to tape within interlaced video stream. Film-like frame rates are possible by using pulldown. DVCPRO HD supports native progressive format when recorded to P2 memory cards.\n\nDVCPRO, also known as DVCPRO25, is a variation of DV developed by Panasonic and introduced in 1995 for use in electronic news gathering (ENG) equipment.\n\nUnlike baseline DV, DVCPRO uses \"locked audio\" and 4:1:1 chroma subsampling for both 50 Hz and 60 Hz variants to decrease generation losses. Audio is available in 16-bit/48 kHz precision.\n\nWhen recorded to tape, DVCPRO uses wider track pitch - 18 μm vs. 10 μm of baseline DV, which reduces the chance of dropout errors during recording. Two extra longitudinal tracks provide support for audio cue and for timecode control. Tape is transported 80% faster compared to baseline DV, resulting in shorter recording time. Long Play mode is not available.\n\nIn 1996 Sony responded with its own professional version of DV called DVCAM.\n\nLike DVCPRO, DVCAM uses locked audio, which prevents audio synchronization drift that may happen on DV if several generations of copies are made.\n\nWhen recorded to tape, DVCAM uses 15 μm track pitch, which is 50% wider compared to baseline. Accordingly, tape is transported 50% faster, which reduces recording time by one third compared to regular DV. Because of the wider track and track pitch, DVCAM has the ability to do a frame-accurate insert edit, while regular DV may vary by a few frames on each edit compared to the preview.\n\nDVCPRO50 was introduced by Panasonic in 1997 for high-value electronic news gathering and digital cinema, and is often described as two DV codecs working in parallel.\n\nThe DVCPRO50 doubles the coded video data rate to 50 Mbit/s. This has the effect of cutting total record time of any given storage medium in half. Chroma resolution is improved by using 4:2:2 chroma subsampling.\n\nDVCPRO50 was used in many productions where high definition video was not required. For example, BBC used DVCPRO50 to record high-budget TV series, such as \"Space Race\" (2005) and \"\" (2006).\n\nA similar format, D-9, offered by JVC, uses videocassettes with the same form-factor as VHS.\n\nComparable high quality standard definition digital tape formats include Sony's Digital Betacam, launched in 1993, and MPEG IMX, launched in 2001.\n\nDVCPRO \"Progressive\" was introduced by Panasonic for news gathering, sports journalism and digital cinema. It offered 480 or 576 lines of progressive scan recording with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling and four 16-bit 48 kHz PCM audio channels. Like HDV-SD, it was meant as an intermediate format during the transition time from standard definition to high definition video.\n\nThe format offered six modes for recording and playback: 16:9 progressive (50 Mbit/s), 4:3 progressive (50 Mbit/s), 16:9 interlaced (50 Mbit/s), 4:3 interlaced (50 Mbit/s), 16:9 interlaced (25 Mbit/s), 4:3 interlaced (25 Mbit/s).\n\nThe format has been superseded with DVCPRO HD.\n\n\"DVCPRO HD\", also known as \"DVCPRO100\" is a high-definition video format that can be thought of as four DV codecs that work in parallel. Video data rate depends on frame rate and can be as low as 40 Mbit/s for 24 frame/s mode and as high as 100 Mbit/s for 50/60 frame/s modes. Like DVCPRO50, DVCPRO HD employs 4:2:2 color sampling.\n\nDVCPRO HD uses smaller raster size than broadcast high definition television: 960x720 pixels for 720p, 1280x1080 for 1080/59.94i and 1440x1080 for 1080/50i. Similar horizontal downsampling is used in many other HD formats. To maintain compatibility with HDSDI, DVCPRO100 equipment upsamples video during playback.\n\nVariable framerates (from 4 to 60 frame/s) are available on \"VariCam\" camcorders. DVCPRO HD equipment offers backward compatibility with older DV/DVCPRO formats.\n\nWhen recorded to tape in standard-play mode, DVCPRO HD uses the same 18 μm track pitch as other DVCPRO flavors. A long play variant, DVCPRO HD-LP, doubles the recording density by using 9 μm track pitch.\n\nDVCPRO HD is codified as SMPTE 370M; the DVCPRO HD tape format is SMPTE 371M, and the MXF Op-Atom format used for DVCPRO HD on P2 cards is SMPTE 390M.\n\nWhile technically DVCPRO HD is a direct descendant of DV, it is used almost exclusively by professionals. Tape-based DVCPRO HD cameras exist only in shoulder mount variant.\n\nA similar format, Digital-S (D-9 HD), was offered by JVC and used videocassettes with the same form-factor as VHS.\n\nThe main competitor to DVCPRO HD was HDCAM, offered by Sony. It uses a similar compression scheme but at higher bitrate.\n\nTape-based DV variants, except for DVCPRO Progressive, do not support native progressive recording, therefore progressively acquired video is recorded within interlaced video stream using pulldown. The same technique is used in television industry to broadcast movies. Progressive-scan DV camcorders for 60 Hz market record 24-frame/s video using 2-3 pulldown and 30-frame/s video using 2-2 pulldown. Progressive-scan DV camcorders for 50 Hz market record 25-frame/s video using 2-2 pulldown.\n\nProgressive video can be recorded with interlaced delivery in mind, in which case high-frequency information between fields is blended to suppress interline twitter. If the goal is progressive-scan distribution like Web videos, progressive-scan DVD-video or filmout, then no filtering is applied. Video recorded with 2-2 pulldown and no vertical filtering is conceptually identical to progressive segmented frame.\n\nConsumer-grade DV camcorders capable of progressive recording usually offer only 2-2 pulldown scheme because of its simplicity. Such a video can be edited as either interlaced or progressive and does not require additional processing aside of treating every pair of fields as one complete frame. Canon and Panasonic call this format \"Frame Mode\", while Sony calls it \"Progressive Scan recording\". 24 frame/s recording is available only on professional DV camcorders and requires \"pulldown removal\" if editing at native frame rate is required.\n\nDVCPRO HD supports native progressive recording at 50 or 60 frame/s in 720p mode. To record video acquired at 24, 25 or 30 frame/s frame repeating is used. Frame repeating is similar to field repeating used in interlaced video, and is also called pulldown sometimes.\n\nDV was originally designed for recording onto magnetic tape. Tape is enclosed into videocassette of four different sizes: small, medium, large and extra-large. All DV cassettes use tape that is ¼ inch (6.35 mm) wide.\n\nSmall cassettes, also known as \"S-size\" or MiniDV cassettes, had been intended for amateur use, but have become accepted in professional productions as well. MiniDV cassettes are used for recording baseline DV, DVCAM, and HDV. Each tape holds about 13 GB for one hour of video.\n\nMedium or \"M-size\" cassettes are used in professional Panasonic equipment and are often called \"DVCPRO tapes\". Panasonic video recorders that accept medium cassette can play back from and record to medium cassette in different flavors of DVCPRO format; they will also play small cassettes containing DV or DVCAM recording via an adapter.\n\nLarge or \"L-size\" cassettes are accepted by most standalone DV tape recorders and are used in many shoulder-mount camcorders. The L-size cassette can be used in both Sony and Panasonic equipment; nevertheless, they are often called \"DVCAM tapes\". Older Sony decks would not play large cassettes with DVCPRO recordings, but newer models can.\n\nExtra-large cassettes or \"XL-size\" have been designed for use in Panasonic equipment and are sometimes called DVCPRO XL. These cassettes are not widespread, and only two models of standalone Panasonic tape recorders can accept them.\n\nTechnically, any DV cassette can record any variant of DV video. Nevertheless, manufacturers often label cassettes with DV, DVCAM, DVCPRO, DVCPRO50 or DVCPRO HD and indicate recording time with regards to the label posted. Cassettes labeled as DV indicate recording time of baseline DV; another number can indicate recording time of Long Play DV. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO have a yellow tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO25 is used; with DVCPRO50 the recording time is half, with DVCPRO HD it is a quarter. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO50 have a blue tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO50 is used. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO HD have a red tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO HD-LP format is used; a second number may be used for DVCPRO HD recording, which will be half as long.\n\nPanasonic stipulated use of a particular magnetic-tape formulation—Metal Particle (MP)—as an inherent part of its DVCPRO family of formats. Regular DV tape uses Metal Evaporate (ME) formulation, which was pioneered for use in Hi8 camcorders. Early Hi8 ME tape was plagued with excessive dropouts, which forced many shooters to switch to more expensive MP tape. After the technology improved, the dropout rate was greatly reduced, nevertheless Panasonic deemed ME formulation not robust enough for professional use. Tape-based Panasonic camcorders do not use small DV cassettes, effectively preventing use of ME tape.\n\nWith proliferation of tapeless camcorder video recording, DV video can be recorded on optical discs, solid state flash memory cards and hard disk drives and used as computer files. In particular:\n\nVideo is stored either as native DIF bitstream or wrapped into an audio/video container such as AVI, QuickTime and MXF.\n\n\nNearly all DV camcorders and decks have IEEE 1394 (FireWire, i.LINK) ports for digital video transfer. When video is captured onto a computer it is stored in a container file, which can be either raw DV stream, AVI, WMV or QuickTime. Whichever container is used, the video itself is not re-encoded and represents a complete digital copy of what has been recorded onto tape. If needed, the video can be recorded back to tape to create a full and lossless copy of the original footage.\n\nSome camcorders also feature a USB 2.0 port for computer connection. This port is usually used for transferring still images, but not for video transfer. Camcorders that offer video transfer over USB usually do not deliver full DV quality - usually it is 320x240 video, except for the Sony DCR-PC1000 camcorder and some Panasonic camcorders that provide transfer of a full-quality DV stream via USB by using the UVC protocol. Full-quality DV can also be captured via USB by using separate hardware that receives DV data from the camcorder over a FireWire cable and forwards it without any transcoding to the computer via a USB cable - this can be particularly useful for capturing on modern laptop computers which frequently do not have a FireWire port or expansion slot but always have USB ports.\n\nHigh end cameras and VTRs may have additional professional outputs such as SDI, SDTI or analog component video. All DV variants have a time code, but some older or consumer computer applications fail to take advantage of it.\n\nThe high quality of DV images, especially when compared to Video8 and Hi8 which were vulnerable to an unacceptable amount of video dropouts and \"hits\", prompted the acceptance by mainstream broadcasters of material shot on DV. The low costs of DV equipment and their ease of use put such cameras in the hands of a new breed of videojournalists. Programs such as TLC's and ABC News's Hopkins: 24/7 were shot on DV.\n\nDVCPRO HD was the preferred high definition standard of the BBC Factual.\n\nMost DV players, editors and encoders only support the basic DV format, but not its professional versions. DV Audio/Video data can be stored as raw DV data stream file (data is written to a file as the data is received over FireWire, file extensions are .dv and .dif) or the DV data can be packed into container files (ex: Microsoft AVI, Apple MOV). The DV meta-information is preserved in both file types.\n\nMost Windows video software only supports DV packed into AVI containers, as they use Microsoft's avifile.dll, which only supports reading avi files. A few notable exceptions exist, while Mac OS X video software support both AVI and MOV containers.\n\nThere was considerable controversy solely based on hearsay over whether or not using tapes from different manufacturers could lead to dropouts. Initially this was suggested around the conception of mostly MiniDV tapes in the mid to late 90s as the only two manufacturers of MiniDV tapes (Sony, who produce their tapes solely under the Sony brand; and Panasonic, who produce their own tapes under their Panasonic brand and outsources for TDK, Canon, etc.) used two different lubrication types for their cameras - Sony uses a 'wet' lubricant ('ME' or 'Metal Evaporated'), while Panasonic uses a 'dry' lubricant ('MP' or 'Metal Particle').\n\nThough the controversy still remain standard practice for encouraging casual and professional camera operators alike not to mix brands of tapes (as the different lubrication formulations can cause or encourage tape wear if not cleaned by a cleaning cassette), no significant problems have occurred for the last few years - meaning that switching tapes is acceptable, though sticking to one brand (and cleaning the heads with a cleaning cassette before doing so) is highly recommended.\n\nA research undertaken by Sony claimed that there was no hard evidence of the above statement. The only evidence claimed was that using ME tapes in equipment designed for MP tapes can cause tape damage and hence dropouts. Sony has done a significant amount of internal testing to simulate head clogs as a result of mixing tape lubricants, and has been unable to recreate the problem. Sony recommends using cleaning cassettes once every 50 hours of recording or playback. For those who are still skeptical, Sony recommends cleaning video heads with a cleaning cassette before trying another brand of tape.\n\n"}
{"id": "590696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=590696", "title": "Definite description", "text": "Definite description\n\nA definite description is a denoting phrase in the form of \"the X\" where X is a noun-phrase or a singular common noun. The definite description is \"proper\" if X applies to a unique individual or object. For example: \"the first person in space\" and \"the 42nd President of the United States of America\", are proper. The definite descriptions \"the person in space\" and \"the Senator from Ohio\" are \"improper\" because the noun phrase X applies to more than one thing, and the definite descriptions \"the first man on Mars\" and \"the Senator from some Country\" are \"improper\" because X applies to nothing. Improper descriptions raise some difficult questions about the law of excluded middle, denotation, modality, and mental content.\n\nAs France is currently a republic, it has no king. Bertrand Russell pointed out that this raises a puzzle about the truth value of the sentence \"The present King of France is bald.\"\n\nThe sentence does not seem to be true: if we consider all the bald things, the present King of France isn't among them, since there is no present King of France. But if it is false, then one would expect that the negation of this statement, that is, \"It is not the case that the present King of France is bald,\" or its logical equivalent, \"The present King of France is not bald,\" is true. But this sentence doesn't seem to be true either: the present King of France is no more among the things that fail to be bald than among the things that are bald. We therefore seem to have a violation of the Law of Excluded Middle.\n\nIs it meaningless, then? One might suppose so (and some philosophers have; see below) since \"the present King of France\" certainly does fail to refer. But on the other hand, the sentence \"The present King of France is bald\" (as well as its negation) seem perfectly intelligible, suggesting that \"the Present King of France\" can't be meaningless.\n\nRussell proposed to resolve this puzzle via his theory of descriptions. A definite description like \"the present King of France\", he suggested, isn't a referring expression, as we might naively suppose, but rather an \"incomplete symbol\" that introduces quantificational structure into sentences in which it occurs. The sentence \"the present King of France is bald\", for example, is analyzed as a conjunction of the following three quantified statements:\n\n\nMore briefly put, the claim is that \"The present King of France is bald\" says that some x is such that x is currently King of France, and that any y is currently King of France only if y = x, and that x is bald: \n\nThis is \"false\", since it is \"not\" the case that some x is currently King of France.\n\nThe negation of this sentence, i.e. \"The present King of France is not bald\", is ambiguous. It could mean one of two things, depending on where we place the negation 'not'. On one reading, it could mean that there is no one who is currently King of France and bald:\n\nOn this disambiguation, the sentence is \"true\" (since there is indeed no x that is currently King of France).\n\nOn a second reading, the negation could be construed as attaching directly to 'bald', so that the sentence means that there is currently a King of France, but that this King fails to be bald:\n\nOn this disambiguation, the sentence is \"false\" (since there is no x that is currently King of France).\n\nThus, whether \"the present King of France is not bald\" is true or false depends on how it is interpreted at the level of logical form: if the negation is construed as taking wide scope (as in the first of the above)), it is true, whereas if the negation is construed as taking narrow scope (as in the second of the above]), it is false. In neither case does it lack a truth value.\n\nSo we do \"not\" have a failure of the Law of Excluded Middle: \"the present King of France is bald\" (i.e. formula_4) is false, because there is no present King of France. The negation of this statement is the one in which 'not' takes wide scope: formula_5. This statement is \"true\" because there does not exist anything which is currently King of France.\n\nStephen Neale, among others, has defended Russell's theory, and incorporated it into the theory of generalized quantifiers. On this view, 'the' is a quantificational determiner like 'some', 'every', 'most' etc. The definite description 'the' has the following denotation (using lambda notation):\n\nwe then get the Russellian truth conditions via two steps of function application: 'The present King of France is bald' is true if, and only if formula_4. On this view, definite descriptions like 'the present King of France' do have a denotation (specifically, definite descriptions denote a function from properties to truth values—they are in that sense not syncategorematic, or \"incomplete symbols\"); but the view retains the essentials of the Russellian analysis, yielding exactly the truth conditions Russell argued for.\n\nThe Fregean analysis of definite descriptions, implicit in the work of Frege and later defended by Strawson (1950) among others, represents the primary alternative to the Russellian theory. On the Fregean analysis, definite descriptions are construed as referring expressions rather than quantificational expressions. Existence and uniqueness are understood as a presupposition of a sentence containing a definite description, rather than part of the content asserted by such a sentence. The sentence 'The present King of France is bald', for example, isn't used to claim that there exists a unique present King of France who is bald; instead, that there is a unique present King of France is part of what this sentence \"presupposes\", and what it \"says\" is that this individual is bald. If the presupposition fails, the definite description fails to refer, and the sentence as a whole fails to express a proposition.\n\nThe Fregean view is thus committed to the kind of truth value gaps (and failures of the Law of Excluded Middle) that the Russellian analysis is designed to avoid. Since there is currently no King of France, the sentence 'The present King of France is bald' fails to express a proposition, and therefore fails to have a truth value, as does its negation, 'The present King of France is not bald'. The Fregean will account for the fact that these sentences are nevertheless \"meaningful\" by relying on speakers' knowledge of the conditions under which either of these sentences \"could\" be used to express a true proposition. The Fregean can also hold on to a restricted version of the Law of Excluded Middle: for any sentence whose presuppositions are met (and thus expresses a proposition), either that sentence or its negation is true.\n\nOn the Fregean view, the definite article 'the' has the following denotation (using lambda notation):\n\n(That is, 'the' denotes a function which takes a property f and yields the unique object z that has property f, if there is such a z, and is undefined otherwise.) The presuppositional character of the existence and uniqueness conditions is here reflected in the fact that the definite article denotes a partial function on the set of properties: it is only defined for those properties f which are true of exactly one object. It is thus undefined on the denotation of the predicate 'currently King of France', since the property of currently being King of France is true of no object; it is similarly undefined on the denotation of the predicate 'Senator of the US', since the property of being a US Senator is true of more than one object.\n\nFollowing the example of \"Principia Mathematica\", it is customary to use a definite description operator symbolized using the \"turned\" (rotated) Greek lower case iota character \"℩\". The notation ℩formula_15 means \"the unique formula_16 such that formula_17\", and\n\nis equivalent to \"There is exactly one formula_20 and it has the property\nformula_21\":\n\n"}

The empty string is the special case where the sequence has length zero, so there are no symbols in the string.\nThere is only one empty string, because two strings are only different if they have different lengths or a different sequence of symbols.\nIn formal treatments, the empty string is denoted with ε or sometimes Λ or λ.\n\nThe empty string should not be confused with the empty language ∅, which is a formal language (i.e. a set of strings) that contains no strings, not even the empty string.\n\nThe empty string has several properties:\n\nIn context-free grammars, a production rule that allows a symbol to produce the empty string is known as an ε-production, and the symbol is said to be \"nullable\".\n\nIn most programming languages, strings are a data type. Individual strings are typically stored in consecutive memory locations.\nThis means that the same string (for example, the empty string) could be stored in two different places in memory.\nIn this way there could be multiple empty strings in memory, in contrast with the formal theory definition, for which there is only one possible empty string.\nHowever, a string comparison function would indicate that all of these empty strings are equal to each other.\n\nIn most programming languages, the empty string is distinct from a null reference (or null pointer) because a null reference does not point to any string at all, not even the empty string.\n\nThe empty string is a legitimate string, upon which most string operations should work. Some languages treat some or all of the following in similar ways, which can lessen the danger: empty strings, null references, the integer 0, the floating point number 0, the boolean value false, the ASCII character NUL, or other such values.\n\nThe empty string is usually represented similarly to other strings. In implementations with string terminating character (null-terminated strings or plain text lines), the empty string is indicated by the immediate use of this terminating character.\n\nThe empty string is a syntactically valid representation of zero in positional notation (in any base), which does not contain leading zeros. Since the empty string does not have a standard visual representation outside of formal language theory, the number zero is traditionally represented by a single decimal digit 0 instead.\n\nZero-filled memory area, interpreted as a null-terminated string, is an empty string.\n\nEmpty lines of text show the empty string. This can occur from two consecutive EOLs, as often occur in text files, and this is sometimes used in text processing to separate paragraphs, e.g. in MediaWiki.\n\n"}

{"id": "652442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=652442", "title": "FOB (shipping)", "text": "FOB (shipping)\n\nFOB, \"Free On Board\", is a term in international commercial law specifying at what point respective obligations, costs, and risk involved in the delivery of goods shift from the seller to the buyer under the Incoterms standard published by the International Chamber of Commerce. FOB is only used in non-containerized sea freight or inland waterway transport. As with all Incoterms, FOB does not define the point at which ownership of the goods is transferred.\n\nThe term FOB is also used in modern domestic shipping within the United States to describe the point at which a seller is no longer responsible for shipping cost.\n\nOwnership of a cargo is independent from Incoterms. In international trade, ownership of the cargo is defined by the bill of lading or waybill.\n\nUnder the Incoterms 2010 standard published by the International Chamber of Commerce, FOB is only used in sea freight and stands for \"Free On Board\". The term is always used in conjunction with a port of loading.\n\nIndicating \"FOB \"port\" means that the seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment, plus loading costs. The buyer pays the cost of marine freight transport, insurance, unloading, and transportation from the arrival port to the final destination. The passing of risks occurs when the goods are loaded on board at the port of shipment. For example, \"FOB Vancouver\" indicates that the seller will pay for transportation of the goods to the port of Vancouver, and the cost of loading the goods on to the cargo ship (this includes inland haulage, customs clearance, origin documentation charges, demurrage if any, origin port handling charges, in this case Vancouver). The buyer pays for all costs beyond that point, including unloading. Responsibility for the goods is with the seller until the goods are loaded on board the ship. Once the cargo is on board, the buyer assumes the risk.\nThe use of \"FOB\" originated in the days of sailing ships. When the ICC first wrote their guidelines for the use of the term in 1936, the ship's rail was still relevant, as goods were often passed over the rail by hand. In 1954, in the case of \"Pyrene Co. Ltd. v. Scindia Steam Navigation Co. Ltd.\", Justice Devlin, ruling on a matter relating to liability under an FOB contract, described the situation thus:\n\nIn the modern era of containerization, the term \"ship's rail\" is somewhat archaic for trade purposes, as with a sealed shipping container there is no way of establishing when damage occurred after the container has been sealed. The standards have noted this. Incoterms 1990 stated,\nIncoterms 2000 adopted the wording,\nThe phrase \"passing the ship's rail\" is no longer in use, having been dropped from the FOB Incoterm in the 2010 revision.\n\nDue to potential confusion with domestic North American usage of \"FOB\", it is recommended that the use of Incoterms be explicitly specified, along with the edition of the standard. For example, \"FOB New York (Incoterms 2000)\". Incoterms apply to both international trade and domestic trade, as of the 2010 revision.\n\nIn North America, FOB is written into a sales agreement to determine where the liability responsibility for the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. FOB stands for \"Free On Board\" or so there is no line item payment by the buyer for the cost of getting the goods onto the transport. There are two possibilities: \"FOB origin\", or \"FOB destination\". \"FOB origin\" means the transfer occurs as soon as the goods are safely on board the transport. \"FOB destination\" means the transfer occurs the moment the goods are removed from the transport at the destination. \"FOB origin\" (also sometimes phrased as \"FOB shipping\" or \"FOB shipping point\") indicates that the sale is considered complete at the seller's shipping dock, and thus the buyer of the goods is responsible for freight costs and liability during transport. With \"FOB destination\", the sale is complete at the buyer's doorstep and the seller is responsible for freight costs and liability during transport.\n\nThe two terms have a specific meaning in commercial law and cannot be altered. But the FOB terms do not need to be used, and often are not. In this case the specific terms of the agreement can vary widely, in particular which party, buyer or seller, pays for the loading costs and shipment costs, and/or where responsibility for the goods is transferred. The last distinction is important for determining liability or risk of loss for goods lost or damaged in transit from the seller to the buyer.\n\nFor example, a person in Miami purchasing equipment from a manufacturer in Chicago could receive a price quote of \"$5000 FOB Chicago\", which would indicate that the buyer would be responsible for the shipping from Chicago to Miami. If the same seller issued a price quote of \"$5000 FOB Miami\", then the seller would cover shipping to the buyer's location.\n\nInternational shipments typically use \"FOB\" as defined by the Incoterms standards, where it always stands for \"Free On Board\". Domestic shipments within the United States or Canada often use a different meaning, specific to North America, which is inconsistent with the Incoterms standards.\n\nNorth American FOB usage corresponds to Incoterms approximately as follows:\nA related but separate term \"CAP\" (\"customer-arranged pickup\") is used to denote that the buyer will arrange a carrier of their choice to pick the goods up at the seller's premises, and the liability for any damage or loss belongs to the buyer.\n\nAlthough FOB has long been stated as \"'Freight On Board'\" in sales contract terminology, this should be avoided as it does not precisely conform to the meaning of the acronym as specified in the UCC.\n\nSometimes FOB is used in sales to retain commission by the outside sales representative. It is unclear where this originated.\n\nIn the past, the FOB point determined when title transferred for goods. For example, at year- and period-end goods in transit under \"FOB destination\" (North American usage) appear on the seller's balance sheet but not in the buyer's balance sheet, as the risk and rewards of ownership change to the buyer at the \"destination\" port.\n\nIt is much easier to determine when title transfers by referring to the agreed upon terms and conditions of the transaction; typically, title passes with risk of loss. The transfer of title may occur at a different time (or event) than the FOB shipping term. The transfer of title is the element of revenue that determines who owns the goods and the applicable value.\n\nImport fees when they reach the border of one country to enter the other country under the conditions of FOB destination are due at the customs port of the destination country.\n\nWith the advent of e-commerce, most commercial electronic transactions occur under the terms of \"FOB shipping point\" or \"FCA shipping point\".\n\nSome sources claim that FOB stands for \"Freight On Board\". This is not the case. The term \"Freight On Board\" is not mentioned in any version of Incoterms, and is not defined by the Uniform Commercial Code in the USA. Further to that, it has been found in the US court system that \"Freight On Board\" is not a recognized industry term. Use of the term \"Freight On Board\" in contracts is therefore very likely to cause confusion.\n"}

{"id": "3247833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3247833", "title": "Injured reserve list", "text": "Injured reserve list\n\nThe injured reserve list ( IR list) is an official designation used by the National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL) for athletes who become injured and temporarily unable to play. It is analogous to the injured list in the Canadian Football League (CFL) or the disabled list in Major League Baseball (MLB). The National Basketball Association (NBA) does not have a direct analog to an injured reserve list, instead using a more general-purpose \"inactive list\" that does not require a player to be injured.\n\nIt is used because the rules of these leagues allow for only a certain numbers of players on each team's roster. Designating a player as \"Injured/Reserve\" frees up a roster spot, enabling the team to add a new replacement player during the injured athlete's convalescence. In the NFL, when a player is placed on the injured reserve list he cannot return to play for the remainder of the regular season even if fully fit; the other leagues allow the player to return to play during the season.\n\nA player may be placed on injured reserve if he is unable to participate due to illness or injury, provided that the player had passed the club's initial physical examination at the start of the season. To qualify for the IR due to injury, that injury must be sufficient (in the opinion of the team's medical staff) to render the player unable to participate for the seven days following that injury. Once placed on IR, the team may then replace the player on their roster. The player on IR may not return to active play for seven days, although they may participate in non-competitive events such as practice, meetings, etc.\n\nA team may place a player on injured reserve (reserve/injured list) who is \"not immediately available for participation with a club\". Generally, these players may not practice or return to the Active List for the rest of the season (including postseason games or the Pro Bowl) in which they are placed on injured reserve, but are allowed to be with the team.\n\nDuring the preseason, the league also allows players with long-term, but not season-ending, injuries to be placed into one of two designations: physically unable to perform (PUP), for injuries sustained during the previous season or during offseason training activities (a player who passes their physical at the beginning of training camp and practices is physically able to participate and is thus ineligible for the PUP list), or reserve/non-football injury, for injuries sustained outside of team or league activities (despite the name, this includes lingering injuries from college football play, should an injured player be drafted and join the team). Both designations are functionally identical in that the player can be promoted to the active roster by week 6 of the regular season or placed on injured reserve. During the regular season, players on the PUP list and injured reserve do not count against the league's 53 man roster maximum, but do count against the 90 man roster limit (also includes practice squad players). \n\nStarting in 2012, the NFL and the NFLPA reached an agreement allowing one player placed on injured reserve to be brought back to the active roster. Provided that the player was on the final 53-man preseason roster (A rule exempted for the 2012 season), and that the injury is deemed to keep this player unable to practice or play football for an estimated six weeks, the player may be allowed to practice after Week 6, and be activated to play after Week 8. As of 2017, teams may now return two players from injured reserve after Week 8.\n\nTeams may also place a player on injured reserve with a minor injury designation, but the team must release the player once he is healthy.\n\nDue to abuses in the use of the injured reserve list, where some teams found it convenient to use the IR to stash players without independent medical oversight, the injured reserve has been renamed the Inactive List with the last collective bargaining agreement. Starting in the , players can enter the inactive list one hour before tip-off for as little as one game. The inactive list has a minimum of one player and a maximum of three, subject to hardship rules when a team with three injured players already on its inactive list has a fourth player injured. Players sent to the NBA G League will continue to count on a team's inactive list.\n"}

The latter were considered a commodity for which philatelists could be taxed. This type of taxation was introduced by the Soviet government in addition to revenue it collected from stamp sales. International trading tax stamps were issued by the Posledgol Central Commission of VTsIK, the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily and, later, by the Soviet Philatelic Association.\n\nIn 1922, the first international trading tax stamps were introduced by . These were the first two RSFSR stamps designed by Rihards Zariņš and overprinted with surcharges of 250 and 500 rubles, respectively. These newly surcharged stamps did not have postal value and were used as a proof that taxes had been paid on stamps exported from, or imported into, Russia.\n\nThis practice was continued under the USSR, and in December 1923, some tsarist issues were subject to export surcharge made by the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily. For the same purpose, Soviet definitive issues of 1921 were also used.\nSubsequently, similar tax stamps were issued by the government, via the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily and the Soviet Philatelic Association, in 1925, 1928, 1931, and 1932.\n\nDuring the period of the New Economic Policy, the early Soviet government followed a policy of regarding stamp traders as just another type of the petit-bourgeois traders. They were allowed to operate by paying a tax, although some of them conducted affairs in the old way. Illegal trading was especially spread among the old specialists in the export bureau, and a few of them were even arrested and jailed.\n\nIn conformity with the new governmental policy, the practice of taxing philatelists engaged in international stamp trading was introduced across the whole country. Moscow, Kharkov, Tashkent, Tbilisi, Leningrad, Rostov-on-Don, Vladivostok, and Simferopol were served as points of arrival where the trading tax had to be paid. The revenues from international trading tax stamps were directed to various relief funds.\n\nMembers of the All-Union Society of Collectors (VOK) denounced those philatelists who did not comply with the new trading policy. For example, one of the editors stated in \"Sovetskii Kollektsioner\":\nIn another article, a member advocated the VOK from blaming that it was \"an organisation of private traders and consisted of speculators, disfranchised persons and similar elements which, of course do not merit the slightest trust.\"\n\nIn response, the author argued:\nUsing appropriately overprinted stamps, the philatelic tax system existed at least until 1940. Fees were collected even on the samples of stamps sent abroad by the Soviet Philatelic Association and its successor, the Philatelic Department of .\n"}
{"id": "14708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14708", "title": "Italian language", "text": "Italian language\n\nItalian (\"italiano\" or ) is a Romance language. Italian is by most measures, together with the Sardinian language, the closest language to Vulgar Latin of the Romance languages. Italian is an official language in Italy, Switzerland, San Marino, Vatican City and western Istria (in Slovenia and Croatia). It formerly had official status in Albania, Malta and Monaco, and is still widely spoken some parts of France (especially Corsica, Nice, Savoie), Greece (Ionian Islands and Dodecanese) and Montenegro (Kotor), as well as in former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa regions where it plays a significant role in various sectors. Italian is also spoken by large expatriate communities in the Americas and Australia. It also has official minority status in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Romania. Many speakers are native bilinguals of both standardized Italian and other regional languages.\n\nItalian is a major European language, being one of the official languages of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and one of the working languages of the Council of Europe. It is the third most widely spoken first language in the European Union with 69 million native speakers (13% of the EU population) and it is spoken as a second language by 16 million EU citizens (3%). Including Italian speakers in non-EU European countries (such as Switzerland and Albania) and on other continents, the total number of speakers is around 90 million. Italian is the main working language of the Holy See, serving as the lingua franca (common language) in the Roman Catholic hierarchy as well as the official language of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Italian is known as the \"language of music\" because of its use in musical terminology and opera. Its influence is also widespread in the arts and in the luxury goods market. Italian has been reported as the fourth or fifth most frequently taught foreign language in the world.\n\nItalian was adopted by the state after the Unification of Italy, having previously been a literary language based on Tuscan as spoken mostly by the upper class of Florentine society. Its development was also influenced by other Italian languages and to some minor extent, by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders. The incorporation into Italian of learned words from its own ancestor language, Latin, is another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language, scientific terminology and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Italians were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Italian. Its vowels are the second-closest to Latin after Sardinian. As in most Romance languages, stress is distinctive but, unlike most other Romance languages, Italian retains Latin's contrast between short and long consonants. Almost all words and syllables finish with pure vowels, a factor that makes Italian words extremely easy to use in rhyming. Italian has a 7 vowel sound system ('e' and 'o' have mid-low and mid-high sounds): Latin had 10, 5 with short and 5 with long sounds.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the established written language in Europe was Latin, though the great majority of people were illiterate, and only a handful were well versed in the language. In the Italian peninsula, as in most of Europe, most would instead speak a local vernacular. These dialects (as they are commonly referred to) were born from Vulgar Latin over the course of centuries, evolving naturally unaffected by formal standards and teachings. They are not in any sense \"dialects of\" standard Italian, that itself started off being one of these local tongues, but sister languages of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general. The Romance dialects of Italy can differ greatly from Italian at all levels (phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon, pragmatics) and are classified typologically as distinct languages.\nThe standard Italian language has a poetic and literary origin in the writings of Tuscan writers of the 12th century, and, even though the grammar and core lexicon are basically unchanged from those used in Florence in the 13th century, the modern standard of the language was largely shaped by relatively recent events. However, Romance vernacular as language spoken in the Apennine peninsula has a longer history. In fact, the earliest surviving texts that can definitely be called vernacular (as distinct from its predecessor Vulgar Latin) are legal formulae known as the Placiti Cassinesi from the Province of Benevento that date from 960–963, although the Veronese Riddle, probably from the 8th or early 9th century, contains a late form of Vulgar Latin that can be seen as a very early sample of a vernacular dialect of Italy.\n\nThe language that came to be thought of as Italian developed in central Tuscany and was first formalized in the early 14th century through the works of Tuscan writer Dante Alighieri, written in his native Florentine. Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the \"Commedia,\" to which another Tuscan poet Giovanni Boccaccio later affixed the title \"Divina\", were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the \"canonical standard\" that all educated Italians could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects. Thus the dialect of Florence became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.\n\nItalian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the Kingdom of Naples, or Austria in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia), even though the masses kept speaking primarily their local vernaculars. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nItaly has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as city-states. Those dialects now have considerable variety. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between Roman Italian and Milanese Italian are the gemination of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed \"e\", and of \"s\" in some cases: e.g. \"va bene\" \"all right\": is pronounced by a Roman (and by any standard Italian speaker), by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the La Spezia–Rimini Line); \"a casa\" \"at home\" is for Roman and standard, for Milanese and generally northern.\n\nIn contrast to the Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama of northern Italy, the Italo-Dalmatian Neapolitan and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-Occitan influences introduced to Italy mainly by bards from France during the Middle Ages, but after the Norman conquest of southern Italy, Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.\n\nThe economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time (Late Middle Ages) gave its language weight, though Venetian remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and Ligurian (or Genoese) remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of Florence during the periods of the rise of the \"Banco Medici\", Humanism, and the Renaissance made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.\n\nThe Renaissance era, known as in Italian, was seen as a time of \"rebirth\", which is the literal meaning of both (from French) and (Italian).\n\nDuring this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church began to be understood from new a perspectives as humanists—individuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potential—began to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves. Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the Protestant Reformation, which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with Martin Luther's rejection of the selling of indulgences by Johann Tetzel and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the Diet of Worms. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of Catholicism, later referred to as Lutheranism. Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the Bible into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only written in Latin, but after the Bible was translated, it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature. The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.\n\nItalian became the language used in the courts of every state in the Italian peninsula. The rediscovery of Dante's and a renewed interest in linguistics in the 16th century, sparked a debate that raged throughout Italy concerning the criteria that should govern the establishment of a modern Italian literary and spoken language. This discussion, known as (i. e., the \"problem of the language\"), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:\n\nA fourth faction claimed that the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mixture of the Tuscan and Roman dialects. \nEventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the Accademia della Crusca in Florence (1582–1583), the official legislative body of the Italian language led to publication of Agnolo Monosini's Latin tome in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.\n\nThe continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the printing press in the fifteen century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.\n\nAn important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by Napoleon in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent). This conquest propelled the unification of Italy some decades after and pushed the Italian language into a lingua franca used not only among clerks, nobility, and functionaries in the Italian courts but also by the bourgeoisie.\n\nItalian literature's first modern novel, \"I promessi sposi\" (The Betrothed) by Alessandro Manzoni, further defined the standard by \"rinsing\" his Milanese \"in the waters of the Arno\" (Florence's river), as he states in the preface to his 1840 edition.\n\nAfter unification, a huge number of civil servants and soldiers recruited from all over the country introduced many more words and idioms from their home languages (\"ciao\" is derived from the Venetian word \"s-cia[v]o\" (\"slave\"), \"panettone\" comes from the Lombard word \"panetton\", etc.). Only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak the Italian standardized language properly when the nation was unified in 1861.\n\nItalian is a Romance language, and is therefore a descendant of Vulgar Latin (the spoken form of non-classical Latin). Standard Italian is based on Tuscan, especially its Florentine dialect, and is therefore an Italo-Dalmatian language, to which Sicilian and the extinct Dalmatian also belong, among a few others.\n\nUnlike most other Romance languages, Italian retains Latin's contrast between short and long consonants. As in most Romance languages, stress is distinctive. In particular, among the Romance languages, Italian is the closest to Latin in terms of vocabulary. Lexical similarity is 89% with French, 87% with Catalan, 85% with Sardinian, 82% with Spanish, 78% with Ladin, 77% with Romanian and 70% with Portuguese.\n\nOne study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin (comparing phonology, inflection, discourse, syntax, vocabulary, and intonation) estimated that among the languages analyzed the distance between Italian and Latin is only higher than that between Sardinian and Latin.\n\nItalian is an official language of Italy and San Marino and is spoken fluently by the majority of the countries' populations. Italian is the third most spoken language in Switzerland (after German and French), and its use has modestly declined since the 1970s. Italian is also used in administration and official documents in Vatican City.\n\nDue to heavy Italian influence during the Italian colonial period, Italian is still understood by some in former colonies. Although it was the primary language in Libya since colonial rule, Italian greatly declined under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, who expelled the Italian Libyan population and made Arabic the sole official language of the country. In Eritrea, Italian is at times used in commerce and the capital city Asmara still has one Italian-language school. Italian was also introduced to Somalia through colonialism and was the sole official language of administration and education during the colonial period but fell out of use after government, educational and economic infrastructure were destroyed in the Somali Civil War.\n\nAlthough over 17 million Americans are of Italian descent, only a little over one million people in the United States speak Italian at home. Nevertheless, an Italian language media market does exist in the country.\n\nItalian immigrants to South America have also brought a presence of the language to that continent. Italian is the second most spoken language in Argentina after the official language of Spanish, with over 1 million (mainly of the older generation) speaking it at home, and Italian has also influenced the dialect of Spanish spoken in Argentina and Uruguay, mostly in phonology, known as Rioplatense Spanish.\n\nItalian is widely taught in many schools around the world, but rarely as the first foreign language. Italian is the fourth most frequently taught foreign language in the world. In the 21st century, technology also allows for the continual spread of the Italian language, as people have new ways for one to learn how to speak, read, and write languages at their own pace and at any given time. For example, the free website and application Duolingo has 4.94 million English speakers learning the Italian language.\n\nAccording to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, every year there are more than 200,000 foreign students who study the Italian language; they are distributed among the 90 Institutes of Italian Culture that are located around the world, in the 179 Italian schools located abroad, or in the 111 Italian lecturer sections belonging to foreign schools where Italian is taught as a language of culture.\n\nFrom the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, thousands of Italians settled in Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and Venezuela, where they formed a physical and cultural presence.\n\nIn some cases, colonies were established where variants of regional languages of Italy were used, and some continue to use this regional language. Examples are Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where Talian is used, and the town of Chipilo near Puebla, Mexico; each continues to use a derived form of Venetian dating back to the nineteenth century. Another example is Cocoliche, an Italian–Spanish pidgin once spoken in Argentina and especially in Buenos Aires, and Lunfardo.\n\nRioplatense Spanish, and particularly the speech of the city of Buenos Aires, has intonation patterns that resemble those of Italian languages because Argentina has had a continuous large influx of Italian settlers since the second half of the nineteenth century: initially primarily from northern Italy; then, since the beginning of the twentieth century, mostly from southern Italy.\n\nStarting in late medieval times in much of Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin was replaced as the primary commercial language by Italian language variants (especially Tuscan and Venetian). These variants were consolidated during the Renaissance with the strength of Italy and the rise of humanism and the arts.\n\nDuring that period, Italy held artistic sway over the rest of Europe. It was the norm for all educated gentlemen to make the Grand Tour, visiting Italy to see its great historical monuments and works of art. It thus became expected to learn at least some Italian. In England, while the classical languages Latin and Greek were the first to be learned, Italian became the second most common modern language after French, a position it held until the late eighteenth century when it tended to be replaced by German. John Milton, for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.\n\nWithin the Catholic church, Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.\n\nItalian loanwords continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and music (especially classical music including opera), in the design and fashion industries, in some sports like football and especially, in culinary terms.\n\nThroughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called Regional Italian, are spoken. In Italy, almost all the other languages spoken as the vernacular — other than standard Italian and some languages spoken among immigrant communities — are often imprecisely called \"Italian dialects\", even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different linguistic branches. The only exceptions to this are twelve groups considered \"historical language minorities\", which are officially recognized as distinct minority languages by the law. On the other hand, Corsican (a language spoken on the French island of Corsica) is closely related to Tuscan, from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.\n\nThe differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: substrata, superstrata, and adstrata. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.\n\nRegional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations the contraction ' replaces ' in the area of Rome for the infinitive \"to go\"; and \"\" is what Venetians say for the infinitive \"to go\").\n\nThere is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latin—including varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italian—began to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. One criterion for determining that two language variants are to be considered separate languages rather than variants of a single language is that they have evolved so that they are no longer mutually intelligible; this diagnostic is effective if mutual intelligibility is minimal or absent (e.g. in Romance, Romanian and Portuguese), but it fails in cases such as Spanish-Portuguese or Spanish-Italian, as native speakers of either pairing can understand each other well if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, on the basis of accumulated differences in morphology, syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon, it is not difficult to identify that for the Romance varieties of Italy, the first extant written evidence of languages that can no longer be considered Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. Tullio De Mauro, an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after World War II contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the Italian diaspora beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.\n\nThe Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.\n\nItalian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of , as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from Vulgar Latin. Some examples:\n\nThe conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of Florence in the region of Tuscany, and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all Italian dialects, radically different from the Gallo-Italian languages less than 100 miles to the north (across the La Spezia–Rimini Line).\n\nThe following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common Western Romance languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan). Some of these features are also present in Romanian.\n\nCompared with most other Romance languages, Italian has a large number of inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. > \"lasciare\" and \"lassare\", > \"cacciare\" and \"cazzare\", > \"sdrucciolare\", \"druzzolare\" and \"ruzzolare\", > \"regina\" and \"reina\", > and , > and . Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from languages farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The La Spezia–Rimini Line, the most important isogloss in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.)\n\nSome other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:\n\nStandard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:\n\nItalian phonotactics do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive extra terminal vowel sounds.\n\nThe Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as \"jeans\", \"whisky\", \"taxi\", \"xenofobo\", \"xilofono\". The letter has become common in standard Italian with the prefix \"extra-\", although \"(e)stra-\" is traditionally used; it is also common to use of the Latin particle \"ex(-)\" to mean \"former(ly)\" as in: \"la mia ex\" (\"my ex-girlfriend\"), \"Ex-Jugoslavia\" (\"Former Yugoslavia\"). The letter appears in the first name \"Jacopo\" and in some Italian place-names, such as Bajardo, Bojano, Joppolo, Jerzu, Jesolo, Jesi, Ajaccio, among others, and in \"Mar Jonio\", an alternative spelling of \"Mar Ionio\" (the Ionian Sea). The letter may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian. Letters used in foreign words can be replaced with phonetically equivalent native Italian letters and digraphs: , , or for ; or for (including in the standard prefix \"kilo-\"); , or for ; , , , or for ; and or for .\n\nItalian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by length and intensity. Length is distinctive for all consonants except for , , , , , which are always geminate when between vowels, and , which is always single.\nGeminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and are realized as lengthened continuants. There is only one vibrant phoneme but the actual pronunciation depends on context and regional accent. Generally one can find a flap consonant in unstressed position whereas is more common in stressed syllables, but there may be exceptions. Especially people from the Northern part of Italy (Parma, Aosta Valley, South Tyrol) may pronounce as , , or .\n\nOf special interest to the linguistic study of Regional Italian is the \"gorgia toscana\", or \"Tuscan Throat\", the weakening or lenition of intervocalic , , and in the Tuscan language.\n\nThe voiced postalveolar fricative is present as a phoneme only in loanwords: for example, \"garage\" . Phonetic is common in Central and Southern Italy as an intervocalic allophone of : \"gente\" 'people' but \"la gente\" 'the people', \"ragione\" 'reason'.\n\nItalian grammar is typical of the grammar of Romance languages in general. Cases exist for personal pronouns (nominative, oblique, accusative, dative), but not for nouns.\n\nThere are two basic classes of nouns in Italian, referred to as genders, masculine and feminine. Gender may be natural (\"ragazzo\" 'boy', \"ragazza\" 'girl') or simply grammatical with no possible reference to biological gender (masculine \"costo\" 'cost', feminine \"costa\" 'coast'). Masculine nouns typically end in \"-o\" (\"ragazzo\" 'boy'), with plural marked by \"-i\" (\"ragazzi\" 'boys'), and feminine nouns typically end in \"-a\", with plural marked by \"-e\" (\"ragazza\" 'girl', \"ragazze\" 'girls). For a group composed of boys and girls, \"ragazzi\" is the plural, suggesting that \"-i\" is a general plural. A third category of nouns is umarked for gender, ending in \"-e\" in the singular and \"-i\" in the plural: \"legge\" 'law, f. sg.', \"leggi\" 'laws, f. pl.'; \"fiume\" 'river, m. sg.', \"fiumi\" 'rivers, m. pl.', thus assignment of gender is arbitrary in terms of form, enough so that terms may be identical but of distinct genders: \"fine\" meaning 'aim, purpose' is masculine, while \"fine\" meaning 'end, ending' (e.g. of a movie) is feminine, and both are \"fini\" in the plural, a clear instance of \"-i\" as a non-gendered default plural marker. These nouns often, but not always, denote inanimates. There are a number of nouns that have a masculine singular and a feminine plural, most commonly of the pattern m. sg. \"-o\", f. pl. \"-a\" (\"miglio\" 'mile, m. sg.', \"miglia\" 'miles, f. pl.'; \"paio\" 'pair, m. sg., \"paia\" 'pairs, f. pl.'), and thus are sometimes considered neuter (these are usually derived from neuter Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.\n\nExamples:\n\nNouns, adjectives, and articles inflect for gender and number (singular and plural).\n\nLike in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.\n\nThere are three types of adjectives: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives \"buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)\" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.\n\nThe order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages. The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in English. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a null-subject language, so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal inflections (e.g. \"amo\" 'I love', \"ama\" 's/he loves', \"amano\" 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.\n\nThere are both indefinite and definite articles in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, selected by the gender of the noun they modify and by the phonological structure of the word that immediately follows the article. \"Uno\" is masculine singular, used before \"z\" ( or ), \"s+consonant\", \"gn\" (), or \"ps\", while masculine singular \"un\" is used before a word beginning with any other sound. The noun \"zio\" 'uncle' selects masculine singular, thus \"uno zio\" 'an uncle' or \"uno zio anziano\" 'an old uncle,' but \"un mio zio\" 'an uncle of mine'. The feminine singular indefinite articles are \"una\", used before any consonant sound, and its abbreviated form, written \"un',\" used before vowels: \"una camicia\" 'a shirt', \"una camicia bianca\" 'a white shirt', \"un'altra camicia\" 'a different shirt'. There are seven forms for definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: \"lo\", which corresponds to the uses of \"uno\"; \"il\", which corresponds to the uses with consonant of \"un\"; \"la,\" which corresponds to the uses of \"una\"; \"l',\" used for both masculine and feminine singular before vowels. In the plural: \"gli\" is the masculine plural of \"lo and l<nowiki>'</nowiki>\"; \"i\" is the plural of \"il\"; and \"le\" is the plural of feminine \"la\" and \"l\"'.\n\nThere are numerous contractions of prepositions with subsequent articles. There are numerous productive suffixes for diminutive, augmentative, pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create neologisms.\n\nThere are 27 pronouns, grouped in clitic and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (\"Lo vedo\". 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (\"Vedo lui, ma non lei\". 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.\n\nThere are three regular sets of verbal conjugations, and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the indicative mood (present tense; past tense with imperfective aspect, past tense with perfective aspect, and future tense), two simple conjugations in the subjunctive mood (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the conditional mood, and one simple conjugation in the imperative mood. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \"to be\" or \"to have\" followed by a past participle. \"To have\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\"Ha detto\", \"ha fatto\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \"to be\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\"È andato\", \"è stato\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \"To be\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\"Ê detto\", \"è fatto\": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.\n\nNote: the plural form of verbs could also be used as an extremely formal (for example to noble people in monarchies) singular form.\n\n\n"}

He is the editor and publisher of Tamil political investigative journal \"Nakkheeran\".\n\nHe completed his school education at Municipal School of Aruppukkottai and SBK Higher Secondary School. After clearing pre-university course at Devanga Arts College, he graduated as Bachelor of Commerce from Saiva Bhanu Kshatriya College in 1977. Apart from academics, he was part of his college hockey team and also involved in art works that could be considered as one of the early signs of a contemporary layout artist and editor.\n\nPost-degree, Rajagopal's father wanted him to be employed in a bank. Rather being idle waiting for a bank profession, Gopal worked in a provisional store much to his father’s displeasure. In 1978, his relative promised him of a job in then Madras however that could not be fulfilled later but eyeing, which Rajagopal had moved into capital city initially.\n\nIn 1983, Rajagopal and his friend jointly started a rubber firm investing around 3000 rupees. Things were not proceeding well from the beginning. Thought exhausted they could manage with just one meal daily. At times, they might even need to cycle all around the city. He turned ill and had returned to his native. He abstained from work for four months during recovery but improved his artistic skills meantime. His friends and neighbours suggested him to seek a relevant job that would display his splendid artworks.\n\nIn 1985, Rajagopal was rightly identified by Valampuri John, the editor of \"Thai\" magazine run by the then Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran. He gained much knowledge on layout work supported by the encouraging editor. He also got exposed to production work during his venture in \"Thiraichuvai\". However, Rajagopal had learnt the success story when he acted as a layout director in \"Tharasu\" magazine. The readers loved the wrapper layout work that sensibly portrayed the message. At this stage, he opted to move out of Tharasu due to various conflicts.\n\nRajagopal, with a sum of four thousand rupees, aggressively decided to start his own political investigative weekly magazine in 1988. He loved the epic title \"Nakkheeran\" but it was possessed by a politician named K. Subbu. When approached, K. Subbu gave away the title that led to the evolution of \"Nakkheeran\", the weekly Tamil magazine. The material suppliers offered fund for 4–10 weeks positively. The office was set up in a small room at Kilpauk on the banks of river Cooum. The first issue of \"Nakkheeran\" came out on 20 April 1988.\n\nThe editor of Nakkheeran Rajagopal (widely identified as Nakkheeran Gopal) locked horns with the state government of Tamil Nadu in Supreme Court of India to receive a landmark judgement in favour of press independence on 7 October 1994. This judgement was unanimously appreciated by global media, details below.\n\nAs an act of bravery, \"Nakkheeran\" is the first ever magazine to interview and expose a portrait of South India’s forest brigand Veerappan. The editor and his team effectively acted as an emissary between Veerappan and state governments to carry out a successful mission in rescuing thespian Rajkumar that calmed down the insecure atmosphere prevailed between two states since abduction in 2000. Earlier, Gopal had been successful in also rescuing eight forest guards kidnapped by Veerappan.\n\nIn 2003, he was arrested on charges of possession of an unlicensed revolver with ammunition.\n\nAfter eight months of imprisonment, Gopal was ordered to be set free on bail by a division bench of the Madras High Court while allowing a habeas corpus petition filed by his brother. Emerging out of the prison, Gopal said his obtaining the bail was the 'first blow' to the \"autocratic rule\" of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa\" This victory is Nakeeran's first step. Let the government file any number of false cases, we will emerge victorious,\" he said in brief remarks as he was given a rousing reception by magazine staff and others in front of the prison complex. The high court had faulted the police for not providing any reasons for his arrest under IPC and Pota. Gopal was first arrested in April this year in connection with the murder of a police informant, allegedly by forest brigand Veerappan, and was subsequently charged under Pota for alleged possession of arms.\n\nNakkeeran Gopal penned a series called \"Challenge\" (late 1990s) and Yutham (late 2000s) in his own \"Nakkheeran\" magazine. Later, the consolidations were released as a book. \"Challenge\" describes the agony put forth by Jayalalithaa between 1991 and 1996 whereas his Yutham (elaborated in four parts) briefs how his team tackled the distress caused by 2001-06 TN Govt.\n\n"}

It is spoken in the Dutch province Gelderland. However, it is quite rare to come across a native speaker of \"Oost-Veluws\", as few people actually still speak this dialect.\n\nOost-Veluws is spoken in places such as the municipalities Elburg en Oldebroek, Epe, Vaassen, Apeldoorn en Dieren. The villages Elspeet, Uddel en Kootwijk in the middle of the Veluwe belong to West-Veluws.\n\nThe delimitation to Sallaans is problematic to the point that some linguists prefer to make a division between Veluws (consisting of West-Veluws and some Oost-Veluws places as Elburg and Oldebroek) and Sallaans (consisting of Sallaans and the rest of the Oost-Veluws region).\n\nMost villages of the area called Veluwe lie on its borders, that is, not in the middle of this sandy woodland. The actual Veluwe is a very sparsely populated area that was rather inaccessible in earlier days. Therefore, it is not surprising that two very important isoglosses have come to lie within the Veluwe.\n\nThe first isogloss is the border between \"old\" and \"olt\" on the Eastern side and the vocalization of \"l\" as in \"oud\" or \"out\" in the West. The retaining of \"ol\" is typical for Low German, while its replacement by \"ou\" is characteristic for Low Frankish.\n\nThe second isogloss pertains to the plural inflection of verbs. In most West Low German dialects, the plural inflection for all person forms is \"t\": \"wiele warkt, ule warkt, zie warkt\" - 'we work, you work, they work'. West-Veluws has a unified plural inflection as well, but on \"-en\" as in Dutch. But in the South and East of the Veluwe, \"-t\" is restricted to the second and third person plural, while the first person takes \"-en\". In the variety of Apeldoorn, for example, it is \"wiele warken, ule warkt, zie warkt\".\n\nThere are also some lexical differences. For example, Oost-Veluws has \"ledder\" 'ladder', while in West-Veluws the form \"leer\" is used which is probably a loan from 17th century Hollandic. This process during which characteristics of Hollandic were adopted in places at the shore of the Zuiderzee, while the IJssel region retained the Low German forms holds also for the two isoglosses cited above.\n\nBut the intensive influence of Hollandic can be observed in Oost-Veluws as well as can be seen when comparing it to Achterhoeks dialect which lies in the East of the Veluwe. E.g. Achterhoeks \"good\", \"beer\", while Dutch and Veluws \"goed\", \"bier\". Germanic long \"ô\" as in \"*grônaz\" 'green\" becomes \"uu\", thus \"gruun\", in comparison to Achterhoeks \"greun\". Here, Oost-Veluws patterns with Sallaans.\n\nDutch \"ui\" usually corresponds to Oost-Veluws \"uu\", while (eastern) Achterhoeks has \"oe\". In all of Sallaans and western Achterhoeks (as in Zutphens), lexical diffusion takes place, and words like \"huus\"/\"huis\" 'house' and \"moes\"/\"muis\" 'mouse' can both be heard.\n"}

The term eventually spread to gamers, who used the term to mean defeat in gaming. \"Owned\" has now spread beyond computer and gaming contexts and become part of standard slang, and typically follows severe defeat or humiliation, usually in an amusing way or through the dominance of an opposing party. Other variations of the word owned include own3d, 0wn3d, pwned, and pooned, terms which incorporate elements of leetspeak.\n\nIn 2009, Newgrounds described a security vulnerability in ActiveX as leaving Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server users open to a \"Browse-And-Get-Owned\" attack.\n\nThe term's original usage was close to that of the traditional meaning of the word \"own\" – for instance, \"I owned the network at MIT\" indicated that the speaker had cracked the servers and had the same root-level privileges that the legitimate owner of the servers had. Some more examples are \"I owned you\" and \"You got owned\". \"Owned,or Ownded\" a later variant, became more common in the late 1990s, as did the more abstract usage referring to any compromised security mechanism. By 1997, \"Owned\" was regularly used in website defacements.\n\nThe term \"owned\" subsequently spread to gaming circles, where it was used to refer to defeat in a game. For example, if a player makes a particularly impressive kill shot or wins a match by an appreciable margin in a multiplayer video game, it is not uncommon for him or her to say \"owned\" to the loser(s), as a manifestation of victory, a taunt, or provocation. \"Ownage\" has become a modern equivalent to \"turkey shoot\"; applicable when an experienced faction predictably annihilates a beginner or disadvantaged faction. In slang form, \"owned\" can be an adjective (He is owned), \"owning\" can be a verb (He is totally owning that guy.), and \"ownage\" can be a noun.\n\nThe phrase \"own\" can not only refer to defeating one particular player or team, but it can also be used to indicate total domination of the competition. The racing video game \"\" follows this definition by awarding a special bonus called \"Own it\", in which a player earns points for every second he/she spends in first place, while also expressing his/her dominance visually to other opponents by painting every portion of the course where he/she leads with his/her tag and colors.\n"}

His father, Paulo Leminski II, was of Polish descent, and his mother, Áurea Pereira Mendes, was of Portuguese, Afro-Brazilian and indigenous descent. In 1958, Leminski was sent to the Monastery of Saint Benedict in São Paulo, where he stayed throughout the whole year. During the First Congress of Brazilian Experimental Poetry in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, he would meet Haroldo de Campos, who would become one of his long-time friends and major influences. In 1961, with only seventeen years old, he would marry Neiva Maria de Sousa, a plastic artist; their relationship would last for seven years, until they divorced. In 1964 he published his first poems in the magazine \"Invenção\", founded by Décio Pignatari, Haroldo de Campos and his brother Augusto. In 1965 he became a history and creative writing teacher, even though he had never finished college. He was also an expert judo sensei.\n\nIn 1968 he married for the second time, now with also poet Alice Ruiz, and had with her three children: Miguel Ângelo (who died prematurely due to a lymphoma), Áurea (named after Leminski's mother) and Estrela Ruiz Leminski, who would also become a poet, artist and musician.

It is an experimental novel, written in prose poetry, dealing with an imaginary visit of philosopher René Descartes to Brazil alongside Prince John Maurice of Nassau during the Dutch invasions of Brazil in the 17th century. \"Catatau\" would draw the attention of some of the most important cultural personalities of the time, such as Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Tom Zé and Moraes Moreira. In the following years he would publish some anthologies of his poems, the most notable ones being \"Distraídos Venceremos\", \"Haitropikais\" (a collection of his \"haiku\") and \"Caprichos e Relaxos\". His second avant-garde novel, \"Agora É que São Elas\", was published in 1984; however, it was not as well-received as \"Catatau\".\n\nLeminski was a polyglot; he could fluently speak French, English, Spanish, Japanese, Latin and Greek. He translated into Portuguese works by Petronius, John Fante, Alfred Jarry, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett and Yukio Mishima. An enthusiast of the culture of Japan, Leminski would write a biography of famous 17th-century \"haiku\" poet Matsuo Bashō in 1983. He also authored biographies of Leon Trotsky, João da Cruz e Sousa and Jesus Christ.\n\nIn 1988, Leminski divorced Alice Ruiz after a 20-year marriage, with whom he was working in conjunction with in his last poetry book, \"La Vie en close\", that was published posthumously in 1991.\n\nLeminski was a heavy drinker, and died on June 7, 1989, of liver cirrhosis.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Earthfast construction is common from the Neolithic period to the present and is used worldwide. Post-in-the-ground construction is sometimes called an \"impermanent\" form such as for houses which are expected to last a decade or two before a better quality structure can be built.\n\nPost in ground construction can also include \"sill on grade\", wood-lined cellars, and pit houses. Most pre-historic and medieval wooden dwellings were built post in ground worldwide.\n\nThis type of construction is often believed to be an intermediate form between a palisade construction and a stave construction. Because the postholes are easily detected in archaeological surveys, they can be differentiated from the other two.\n\nPost-in-ground was one of the timber construction methods used for French colonial structures in New France specifically called poteaux-en-terre.\n\nThe Japanese also used earthfast construction they call Hottate-bashira (literally \"embedded pillars\") until the eighteenth century.\n\nSome places the people still use post in ground construction such as the Toguna shelter of the Dogon people in Africa.\n\nIn the historical region of New France \"poteaux-en-terre\" was a historic style of earthfast timber framing. This method is very similar to poteaux-sur-sol but for the \"boulin\" (hewn posts) planted in the ground rather than landing on a sill plate. The spaces between the boulin were filled with bousillage (reinforced mud) or pierrotage (stones and mud).\n\n\n"}

Based on this argument, GPT was developed as a methodologically grounded means of theorizing communication practices. GPT involves (1) reconstructing communicative practices, (2) redescribing those practices in less context-specific terms, and (3) identifying implicit principles which guide the practice. Generally a GPT study begins by looking for troubles or dilemmas endemic to situated interaction and observable in discourse. This constitutes the “problem level” and the “grounded” component of the GPT approach. Then, problems are reconstructed concretely and abstractly and matched with the techniques which participants employ for dealing with those problems. This constitutes the “technical level” and is an important part of the theorizing process. Finally, the ideals and standards shaping the practice and how to manage its problems and techniques constitute the “philosophical level.” This situates the practice both locally and generally for the purpose of normative critique. A methodological approach which is explicitly guided by GPT is action implicative discourse analysis (AIDA).\n\nIn 1999 Craig wrote a landmark article \"Communication Theory as a Field\" which expanded the conversation regarding disciplinary identity in the field of communication. At that time, communication theory textbooks had little to no agreement on how to present the field or what theories to include in their textbooks. This article has since become the foundational framework for four different textbooks to introduce the field of communication. In this article Craig \"proposes a vision for communication theory that takes a huge step toward unifying this rather disparate field and addressing its complexities.\" To move toward this unifying vision Craig focused on communication theory as a practical discipline and shows how \"various traditions of communication theory can be engaged in dialogue on the practice of communication.\" In this deliberative process theorists would engage in dialog about the \"practical implications of communication theories.\" In the end Craig proposes seven different traditions of Communication Theory and outlines how each one of them would engage the others in dialogue.\n\nCraig proposes that these seven suggested traditions of communication theory have emerged through research into communication, and each one has their own way of understanding communication. These seven traditions are:\n\nThese proposed seven traditions of communication theory are then placed into conversation with each other on a a table first to show how each tradition's different interpretation of communication defines the tradition's vocabulary, communication problems, and commonplaces, and next to show what argumentation between the traditions would look like.\n\nCraig concluded this article with an open invitation to explore how the differences in these theories might shed light on key issues, show where new traditions could be created, and engaging communication theory with communication problems through metadiscourse. Craig further proposes several future traditions that could possibly be fit into the metamodel. A feminist tradition where communication is theorized as \"connectedness to others\", an aesthetic tradition theorizing communication as \"embodied performance\", an economic tradition theorizing communication as \"exchange\", and a spiritual tradition theorizing communication on a \"nonmaterial or mystical plane of existence.\" \n\n\n\n"}

He was best known as a leading exponent of the philosophy of W. V. Quine.\n\nGibson was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Roger Fletcher Gibson Sr. and Virginia Irene Melton. He spent his formative years moving throughout the country, eventually coming to live with his maternal grandparents about whom he would later remark were the most influential people in his life. Gibson joined the United States Marine Corps out of high school and volunteered for duty in Vietnam. He served in Saigon from October 1965 to October 1966. He considered his military service one of his greatest achievements.\n\nGibson embarked upon the pursuit of philosophy as an academic career in 1967 upon the completion of his military service. He was ready to resume his education that year, having served in the United States Marine Corps immediately after high school, between 1962 and 1966, attached for part of that time as aide to General Westmoreland during the height of the Vietnam War. He enrolled in Northeast Missouri State College, currently Truman State University, where he graduated in 1971 with a B.A. in philosophy.\n\nEncouraged by his undergraduate philosophy professors, Henry Smits and Kay Blair, both holding doctorates from the University of Missouri, he applied to their graduate program in philosophy and was admitted in the fall of 1971. He developed a budding affinity for analytic philosophy while at the University of Missouri, receiving an M.A. in 1973 and a Ph.D. in 1977. His experience there was shaped by Arthur Berndtson, Donald Oliver, and John Kultgen, among others, the latter also directing his dissertation.\n\nGibson served the discipline both as a leader and as a scholar. His first notable leadership role was as President of the Central States Philosophical Association in 1983–1984. His scholarly initiatives attracted attention from the outset, earning him grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1984–1985 and 1988. His academic career flourished at Washington University in St. Louis, where he began teaching in 1985. He served as the Chair of the Department of Philosophy there for a decade between 1989 and 1999. His many contributions to the department included spearheading the creation of the school's Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP) Program in 1993, playing a prominent role in securing grants for that purpose from the James S. McDonnell Foundation.\n\nGibson's formal areas of expertise were epistemology and the philosophy of language, with further competence in the philosophy of science. While publishing extensively in these areas, his overall engagement with philosophy was broad and deep enough for publication in other specialties as well, including those as diverse as logic and ethics. Most of his works, even on the rare occasion he turned to ethics, tend to revolve around the philosophy of W. V. Quine. Those that do are all well-received (as are the few that do not), earning him a reputation as one of the world's leading exponents of Quine.\n\nThat reputation is the culmination of an early and steadfast interest in Quine. His master's thesis (1973) and doctoral dissertation (1977) are both on Quine. His persistent appeals to the Harvard philosopher for permission to sit in on his classes at Harvard University, while himself still enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Missouri, are something of an academic legend, related by Quine himself both in his autobiography, \"The Time of My Life: An Autobiography\" (1985), and in his foreword to Gibson's first book, \"The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay\" (1982). The permission granted paved the way for some of the most influential secondary literature on Quine, including two monographs, three edited volumes, and numerous articles. Gibson's two monographs — \"The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay\" (1982) and \"Enlightened Empiricism: An Examination of W. V. Quine's Theory of Knowledge\" (1988) — are held in especially high regard.\n\nHis personal output on Quine was complemented by his ability to bring out the same in others. Attesting to his dedication to the enrichment of Quine studies, he organized, together with Robert B. Barrett Jr., a conference (April 9–13, 1988) bringing together at Washington University in St. Louis the world's foremost authorities on the subject, including Quine himself, as well as Donald Davidson, Dagfinn Føllesdal, Susan Haack, Gilbert Harman, Jaakko Hintikka, Jerrold Katz, Barry Stroud, and Joseph S. Ullian. The proceedings were published in 1990 as \"Perspectives on Quine\".\n\nA festschrift organized in his honor in 2008 brought together eminent analytic philosophers from around the world: Robert B. Barrett Jr.; Lars Bergström; Richard Creath; David Henderson; Terence Horgan; Ernest Lepore; Pete Mandik; Alex Orenstein; Kenneth Shockley; J. Robert Thompson; Josefa Toribio; Joseph S. Ullian; Josh Weisberg; Chase B. Wrenn.\n\nGibson died at the age of 71 in Reston, Virginia, after a long battle with Parkinson’s and Parkinson’s dementia.\n\n"}
{"id": "11865833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11865833", "title": "SPEAKING", "text": "SPEAKING\n\nIn sociolinguistics, SPEAKING or the SPEAKING model, is a model socio-linguistic study (represented as a mnemonic) developed by Dell Hymes. Hymes developed this model as part of a new methodology referred to as the Ethnography of speaking. This model is a tool to assist the identification and labeling of components of interactional linguistics that was driven by his view that, in order to speak a language correctly, one needs not only to learn its vocabulary and grammar, but also the context in which words are used. In essence, the learning the components of the SPEAKING model is essential for Linguistic competence.\n\nTo facilitate the application of his representation, Hymes constructed the acronym, S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G (for \"setting and scene, participants, ends, acts sequence, key, instrumentalities, norms, & genre\") under which he grouped the sixteen components within eight divisions.\n\nThe model had sixteen components that can be applied to many sorts of discourse: message form; message content; setting; scene; speaker/sender; addressor; hearer/receiver/audience; addressee; purposes (outcomes); purposes (goals); key; channels; forms of speech; norms of interaction; norms of interpretation; and genres.\n\nThe SPEAKING model is used by linguistic anthropologists to analyze speech events (one or more Speech act involving one more participants) as part of an Ethnography. This approach can be used to understand relationships and power dynamics within a given Speech community and provide insight on cultural values.\n\n\"Setting refers to the time and place of a speech act and, in general, to the physical circumstances\". The living room in the grandparents' home might be a setting for a family story. Scene is the \"psychological setting\" or \"cultural definition\" of a scene, including characteristics such as range of formality and sense of play or seriousness. The family story may be told at a reunion celebrating the grandparents' anniversary. At times, the family would be festive and playful; at other times, serious and commemorative.\n\nSetting and scene also refer to implicit rules and expectations surrounding the speech event. For instance, the setting of the speech event determines who should speak and who should not, what type of speech is appropriate (Code-switching), and when interrupting is acceptable. For instance, speech events in the classroom have specific implicit rules for teachers speaking and students listening, certain words are not viewed as appropriate in the classroom, and interrupting is often met with consequences. Conversely, different implicit rules and expectations apply at social gatherings and work settings.\n\nScene of the speech event also refers to the location of participants and any physical barriers that may be present. For instance, whether participants are facing one another, what body language they are exhibiting, and whether or not they are separated by a table, chairs, or space in the room. Documentation of the physical setting is especially useful for completing an ethnography of a given community.\n\nParticipants include the speaker and the audience. Linguist anthropologists will make distinctions within these categories. The audience may include those to whom the speech act is directed, and those who are not addressed but overhear. For example, at the family reunion, an aunt might tell a story to the young female relatives, but males, although not addressed, might also hear the narrative.\n\nWhen considering the participants in a speech event, one should consider implicit and explicit rules about who is, can, and should be involved; what expectations are established for the participants; who is speaking and who is being addressed. Certain ideologies are at play regarding participants in speech events. For instance, cultural norms about how child should speak to adults, how ladies should speak around men, how employees should speak to their boss. Each participant in a speech event is operating with specific rules and expectations, which are important for linguistic competence.\n\nThe end of the speech event are the purposes, goals, and outcomes. The aunt may tell a story about the grandmother to entertain the audience, teach the young women, and honor the grandmother. Additionally, the ends of a speech event may differ for those participating. The exampled provided by Harriet Joseph Ottenheimer was that of a tourist seeking directions and a New Yorker providing vague answers, \"your goal may be to get information and get to your destination, but their goal is to appear knowledgeable.\" Differences in the goals and outcomes for speech events can be frequent, especially in classrooms and work spaced. Similarities and differences in the ends of a speech events are important for successful communication and acceptance into a culture or a speech community.\n\nAct sequence refers to the sequence of speech acts that make up the event. The order of speech acts greatly influences of the speech event. For instance the initial speech acts sets the tone for the conversation; beginning a lecture by saying, \"Ladies and gentlemen...\" sets a different tone than beginning a lecture by saying, \"Hello! How is everyone today?\"\n\nAct sequence for an event also orients the participants to social cues. Important aspects of act sequence include turn-taking and interrupting. For example, an aunt's story might begin as a response to a toast to the grandmother; the story's plot and development would have a sequence structured by the aunt. Possibly there would be a collaborative interruption during the telling. Finally, the group might applaud the tale and move onto another subject or activity.\n\n\"Key\" refers to the clues that establish the \"tone, manner, or spirit\" of the speech act. The aunt might imitate the grandmother's voice and gestures in a playful way, or she might address the group in a serious voice emphasizing the sincerity and respect of the praise the story expresses. Generally, different keys are used in different situations, for instance different tones are used at birthday parties and funerals. Intonation in sentences can provide additional meaning; lighter tones communicate humor and friendship, meanwhile monotone speech acts communicate seriousness or a lack of emotion. Similarly, keys can be formal or informal, and can be influenced by word choice. For instance informal keys include the use of contractions (can't instead of cannot), use of slang or profanity, condensed or loose pronunciations (gonna), missing infinitives (\"the kids need bathed\" versus \"the kids need to be bathed), and prepositional endings \"what did you do that for?\" Overall, the key in a speech act adds a human element to communication and provides valuable information for informing social norms and expectations for the speech event. Proper application of the appropriate key in a speech event is vital for linguistic competence.\n\nInstrumentalities are the channels used to complete the speech act. These include the method of communication (writing, speaking, signing or signaling), the language, dialect (a mutually intelligible subset of a language) or register (a variety of a language that is used in specific settings). Hymes described these instrumentalities generally as the Forms and styles of speech. For example, the instrumentality of the spoken word is different from the written word; the language spoken is unique to the speech act, as is the dialect. Similarly, the register that is spoken influences the speech event. For example, an aunt might speak in a casual register with many dialect features, but if her niece continues the conversation in a more formal register with careful grammatically \"standard\" forms the conversation may seem awkward.\n\nSocial rules governing the event and the participants' actions and reactions. In a playful story by the aunt, the norms might allow many audience interruptions and collaboration, or possibly those interruptions might be limited to participation by older females. A serious, formal story by the aunt might call for attention to her and no interruptions as norms.\n\nNorms will vary for each speech community. Examples of questions regarding established norms include: \n\nThe kind of speech act or event; for the example used here, the kind of story. The aunt might tell a character anecdote about the grandmother for entertainment, or an exemplum as moral instruction. Different disciplines develop terms for kinds of speech acts, and speech communities sometimes have their own terms for types. Other examples of speech genres include gossip, jokes, and conversations.\n\nRich points are instances where there is a disconnect between two speakers in a speech event resulting from differences in perceived implicit rules and expectations. These instances represent a conflict in the SPEAKING model between two people. This difference and the negotiation to reestablish the conversation is referred to as MAR (Mistake, Awareness, Repair)\n\nMistakes in conversation occur when participants in the conversation are operating with different implicit rules and expectations for the SPEAKING model. Mistakes often results from disagreements about inclusion of participants, mismatched ends, unexpected act sequences, keys or instrumentalities. In general mistakes and conflicts arise when there is a deviation in the conversation from the norm. In some genres, such as gossip, rapid turn-taking and interrupting is not only accepted, but expected. If one participant is not active in this type of speech they may come across as ambivalent to the conversation; this would be an example of a mistake.\n\nAwareness occurs when one or more of the participants recognized the differences in expectations for the conversation. In some cases, this may mean that one speaker recognizes that the other is speaking faster or slower, using act sequences that rely heavily on fast turn-taking or accepted interrupting, speaking in a more formal or informal register, etc. In the instance of gossip, it would be important to recognize if one is not matching the speech pattern.\n\nRepair of the conversation occurs when one or more participants in the speech event change one or more of the SPEAKING components in order to ameliorate the mistake. In some instances this may mean that the speaker increases the speed of their speech, participates in rapid turn-taking and interrupting. When repair does not occur the speech event can seem awkward. However, when one learns to repair speech events they can more easily connect with participants in the speech event, building rapport.Speaking through by maintaining grammartical rules for understand correctly.\n\nThe speaking model has been applied to understand a variety of communities and situations. Speech events are key to the foundation of culture, thus they are the subject of much analysis. Many people have approached the application of the SPEAKING model to understand conversations in unique populations and settings, to better understand the interplay between culture and language, and to analyze status, power and inequality.\n"}
{"id": "26771230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26771230", "title": "Scenery wagon", "text": "Scenery wagon\n\nA scenery wagon, also known as a \"stage wagon\", is a mobile platform that is used to support and transport movable, three-dimensional theatrical scenery on a theater stage. In most cases, the scenery is constructed on top of the wagon such that the wagon, and the scenery it supports, forms a single, integrated structure. Heavy duty casters are mounted to the underside of the platform so that the entire assembly can be quickly moved onstage or offstage, so as to facilitate rapid scenery changes during live productions. Scenery wagons are built in a wide range of sizes, ranging from less than one square foot up to the size of the playing area of the stage.\n\nScenery wagons comprise one of the four methods used to move scenery during the course of a theatre performance, the other three being \"flying\" (suspending) scenery from a fly system, elevating or lowering scenery on a stage lift, or \"running\" (manually carrying) the scenery.\n\nVarious caster types are used on scenery wagons. The choice of caster type for any particular wagon depends on a number of factors, including platform size and shape, scenery weight, production aesthetics and budget. Typically, casters are mounted so that the bottom of the platform is elevated approximately one-half to three-quarters of an inch above the stage. The number of casters required for a wagon depends on caster type and load rating as well as the size, shape and weight of the wagon and scenery.\n\nSwivel casters are commonly used on smaller wagons because of the flexible, mobility they offer. As the number of swivel casters attached to a wagon increases, though, it becomes increasingly difficult to align them. Consequently, it may be difficult or impossible to move a wagon that has a large number of swivel casters when the casters are unaligned. As a result, rigid casters are preferred for larger wagons, which typically require a proportionally higher number of casters.\n\nAir casters are sometimes used in place of rolling casters. These require pressurized air to operate, which produces audible hiss that is undesirable in some situations, and are typically more expensive than rolling casters, but they have the advantage of \"locking\" the scenery securely in place when depressurized and, like swivel casters, they permit omnidirectional movement.\n\nTo effect a scenery change, a wagon is simply rolled offstage to remove it from the set or rolled onstage to its designated position to add it to the set. In the latter case, the wagon must be immobilized after it has been positioned on the stage so that actors can safely interact with it (e.g., walk, stand, or jump on it) without causing the wagon to move. A number of methods and mechanisms are commonly used to immobilize, or \"lock\" scenery wagons in place:\n\nWooden wedges may be forced between the stage and the bottom edge of the wagon perimeter. Ideally, the wedges are driven under the wagon to the extent that the wagon is supported by the wedges instead of its casters. Wedges are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides of the wagon so that the wagon can't slip off the wedges.\n\nSlip bolts may be used to hold scenery wagons in position when high lateral strength is required and it is permissible to drill holes in the stage. The bolts are mounted to the wagon base and, when the wagon is in position, the bolts are lowered into their designated, predrilled holes.\n\nA lift jack is fundamentally a lever that attaches to the scenery wagon platform with a hinge, with a caster mounted to the underside of the lever near the hinge. When no downward force is applied to the lever handle, the wagon rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks the wagon in place due to friction between the wagon platform and the stage. When the lever handle is forced downward, however, the caster serves as a to lift the wagon slightly above the stage, thus enabling the unit to be rolled.\n\nLift jacks may be built into a wagon or onto a wagon's exterior, as circumstances dictate.\n\nA wagon brake has a handle which, when pushed down, extends a steel rod down and onto the stage. When fully extended, the steel rod actually lifts a section of the wagon slightly off the stage floor. The bottom end of the rod has a threaded cavity that will accept an extension spindle, which in turn can be used to adjust the height of the wagon above the stage. The brake is released by raising its handle, thereby retracting the steel rod away from the stage.\n\nWagon brakes provide a very fast means of locking and unlocking wagons, but the brakes and stage can be damaged if the running crew attempts to move a wagon while its brakes are engaged. Damage to the stage can be mitigated by using extension spindles with compliant (e.g., polyurethane) tips. Toggle clamps, which are functionally similar to wagon brakes, are sometimes used in lieu of theatrical wagon brakes due to their higher load ratings and more durable construction.\n\nHinged foot irons may be bolted to the sides of the wagon. To lock the wagon in place, the free ends of the foot iron hinges are folded down and then secured to the stage with stage screws. This is a reliable method for immobilizing wagons, but it creates holes in the stage and can slow the process of locking and unlocking a wagon. Also, if a foot iron is allowed to contact the stage while the wagon is being moved, the stage floor can be damaged.\n\n"}

In Europe, season creep has been associated with the arrival of spring moving up by approximately one week in a recent 30-year period.\nOther studies have put the rate of season creep measured by plant phenology in the range of 2–3 days per decade advancement in spring, and 0.3–1.6 days per decade delay in autumn, over the past 30–80 years.\n\nObservable changes in nature related to season creep include birds laying their eggs earlier and buds appearing on some trees in late winter. In addition to advanced budding, flowering trees have been blooming earlier, for example the culturally-important cherry blossoms in Japan,\nand Washington, D.C.\nNorthern hardwood forests have been trending toward leafing out sooner, and retaining their green canopies longer.\nThe agricultural growing season has also expanded by 10–20 days over the last few decades.\n\nThe effects of season creep have been noted by non-scientists as well, including gardeners who have advanced their spring planting times,\nand experimented with plantings of less hardy warmer climate varieties of non-native plants. While summer growing seasons are expanding, winters are getting warmer and shorter, resulting in reduced winter ice cover on bodies of water,\nearlier ice-out,\nearlier melt water flows,\nand earlier spring lake level peaks.\nSome spring events, or \"phenophases\", have become intermittent or unobservable; for example, bodies of water that once froze regularly most winters now freeze less frequently,\nand formerly migratory birds are now seen year-round in some areas.\n\nThe full impact of global warming is forecast to happen in the future, but climate scientists have cited season creep as an easily observable effect of climate change that has already occurred and continues to occur.\nA large systematic phenological examination of data on 542 plant species in 21 European countries from 1971–2000 showed that 78% of all leafing, flowering, and fruiting records advanced while only 3% were significantly delayed, and these observations were consistent with measurements of observed warming.\nSimilar changes in the phenology of plants and animals are occurring across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups studied, and these changes are also consistent with the expected impact of global warming.\n\nWhile phenology fairly consistently points to an earlier spring across temperate regions of North America, a recent comprehensive study of the subarctic showed greater variability in the timing of green-up, with some areas advancing, and some having no discernible trend over a recent 44-year period.\nAnother 40 year phenological study in China found greater warming over that period in the more northerly sites studied, with sites experiencing cooling mostly in the south, indicating that the temperature variation with latitude is decreasing there.\nThis study also confirmed that season creep was correlated with warming, but the effect is non-linear—phenophases advanced less with greater warming, and retarded more with greater cooling.\n\nShorter winters and longer growing seasons may appear to be a benefit to society from global warming, but the effects of advanced phenophases may also have serious consequences for human populations. Modeling of snowmelt predicted that warming of 3 to 5 °C in the Western United States could cause snowmelt-driven runoff to occur as much as two months earlier, with profound effects on hydroelectricity, land use, agriculture, and water management.\nSince 1980, earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated with an increase in length and severity of the wildfire season there.\n\nSeason creep may also have adverse effects on plant species as well. Earlier flowering could occur before pollinators such as honey bees become active, which would have negative consequences for pollination and reproduction. Shorter and warmer winters may affect other environmental adaptations including cold hardening of trees, which could result in frost damage during more severe winters.\n\n\"Season creep\" was included in the 9th edition of the Collins English Dictionary published in London June 4, 2007.\nThe term was popularized in the media after the report titled \"Season Creep: How Global Warming Is Already Affecting The World Around Us\" was published by the American environmental organization Clear the Air on March 21, 2006.\nIn the \"Season Creep\" report, Jonathan Banks, Policy Director for Clear the Air, introduced the term as follows:\n\nThe term \"season creep\" has been applied in other contexts as well:\n"}
{"id": "16453220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16453220", "title": "Second-language phonology", "text": "Second-language phonology\n\nThe phonology of second languages is different from the phonology of first languages in various ways. The differences are considered to come from general characteristics of second languages, such as slower speech rate, lower proficiency than native speakers, and from the interaction between non-native speakers' first and second languages. \n\nResearch on second-language phonology has been done not only on segments, but also on prosody. Second-language prosody, like second-language segments, has been studied in terms of both its global characteristics and the interactions between first languages and second languages.\n\nL2 speech rate is typically slower than native speech. For example, Mandarin Chinese speakers’ speech rate in an English utterance is slower than native English speakers’ speech rate (Derwing and Munro, 1995), and speech rates in a sentence by highly experienced Italian and Korean nonnative speakers of English are slower than that of native English speakers' (Guion et al., 2000). In this study, the main factor of the slower speech rate for the Italian and Korean accented English was the durations of the vowels and sonorant consonants (Guion et al., 2000). Another source of the slower speech rate in L2 speech is that L2 speakers tend to not reduce function words, such as \"the\" or \"and,\" as much as native speakers (Aoyama and Guion, 2007). The generally slower speech rate in L2 speech is correlated with the degree of perceived foreign accent by native listeners (Derwing and Munro, 1997).\n\nL2 speech is influenced by the speaker’s L1 background. Such influences have been explored in relation to many prosodic features, such as pitch perception and pitch excursion (Beckman, 1986; Aoyama and Guion, 2007), stress placement (Archibald, 1995, 1998a, 1998b; Flege and Bohn, 1989; Archibald, 1997), syllable structure (Broselow and Park, 1995; Broslow, 1988; Eckman, 1991), and tone (Sereno and Wang, 2007; Guion and Pederson, 2007).\n\nWhen perceiving accented syllables in English, Japanese nonnative speakers of English tend to rely only on F0, or pitch of the accented syllables, while native speakers use F0, duration, and amplitude (Beckman, 1986). This finding was confirmed in production, by showing that the excursions of F0 of English content words were larger for Japanese nonnative speakers of English than for native English speakers (Aoyama and Guion, 2007).\n\nIn both studies, the reason for this phenomenon was proposed to be related to the characteristics of the nonnative speakers’ L1, Japanese. Japanese is a mora-timed language, and because of this, longer syllable duration makes a phonological difference in Japanese. Therefore, when expressing stress in Japanese, Japanese speakers may rely more on F0 than duration, which is a critical cue for a different phonological distinction. This L1 characteristic might interfere with Japanese speakers’ perception and production of English, which is a stress-timed language and might be free of such durational restrictions.\n\nInfluence from L1 to L2 was also found in stress placement on words. Hungarian learners of English tend to place initial stress on English words that do not have initial stress, because Hungarian has fixed initial stress and this is transferred to Hungarian speakers' L2 English prosody (Archibald, 1995; 1998a; 1998b). Spanish speakers of English were found not to stress target stressed syllables in English, and this might be due to the lack of stress in Spanish cognates and the lexical similarity between Spanish and English words (Flege and Bohn, 1989). In addition, it is suggested that speakers of tone languages (e.g., Chinese) and pitch-accent languages (e.g., Japanese), both of which use pitch as a phonologically meaningful item, do not compute stress placement in English, but rather store the stress information lexically (Archibald, 1997).\n\nL2 speakers can also perceive some innate characteristics of the L2, which lead to different repair strategies for different phonological patterns. Korean L2 speakers of English add an extra final vowel to some English words but not to all (Broslow and Park, 1995), as in (1). \n\n(1) Korean pronunciations of English words \nThe problem is that modern Korean does not have a phonological vowel length difference, and Korean speakers show their own repair mechanism for English minimal pairs that have tense/lax difference, by adding an extra final vowel to English words with tense vowels. This might be because Korean learners of English attempt to preserve the mora count of the original English word, by adding an extra final vowel to words that have two moras (Broslow and Park, 1995). The syllable structure of such a word might look like in (2)\n\n(2) Syllable structure of English “beat” by Korean nonnative speakers of English (adapted from Broslow and Park, 1995).\n\nL2 listeners show different patterns of tone perception in tone languages, such as Mandarin Chinese. In Guion and Pederson (2007), native listeners of Mandarin judged the similarity of synthesized Mandarin tones on the basis of both F0 and F0 slope, while English and Japanese listeners used only F0, not F0 slope. However, it was also observed that late learners of Mandarin showed similar patterns of tone perception as native listeners of Mandarin, focusing on both F0 and F0 slope of the tones. This suggests that L2 learners can learn to attend to the cues that L1 speakers use for the tone distinction. \n\nThe possibility of learning new L2 prosodic distinction was further explored in a training study on Mandarin tones (Sereno and Wang, 2007). English L2 listeners’ perception and production of Mandarin tones improved after perceptual training, and this was observed both behaviorally and cortically: L2 listeners’ accuracy of tone perception and production improved, and increased activity of language areas in the left hemisphere (superior temporal gyrus) and neighboring effects on relevant neural areas were observed.\n\n\n\n"}

This computer system was first based on the PDP-11 product line from Digital Equipment Corporation and used the CB Unix operating system and custom application software and device drivers that were developed and maintained by Bell Labs in Columbus, Ohio USA. SCCS was ported to the AT&T 3B20 and 3B5 computers running UNIX System V Release 2 in the early 1980s.\n\nPrior to the SCCS, many telephone company switching centers were staffed 24 hours a day 365 days a year. Deployment of the SCCS allowed telephone companies to significantly reduce the number of technicians by implementing a local switching control center office and dispatch technicians as required to resolve problems or perform routine maintenance operations.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, telephone companies began to phase out the older electromechanical switching systems such as the Number 1 Crossbar, Number 5 Crossbar, and step-by-step circuit switching systems and replace them with newer electronic switching systems that were controlled by proprietary computers but still used analog switch fabrics such as Bell-proprietary ferreed switch devices.\n\nThe SCCS system was phased out during the late 1980s and replaced by an OSS known as Network Monitoring and Analysis or NMA that was developed by Bell Communications Research now Telcordia Technologies. AT&T developed additional products based on SCCS software, such as Compulert.\n\nThe primary purpose of the SCCS system was to provide operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAMP) functions for telephone company network operations staff. The SCCS accepted as input the slow 110 baud Teletype messages from circuit switching systems such as the Number 1 ESS, Number 2 ESS, Number 3 ESS, Number 5 ESS, and Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) network switches and provide analysis, reports, troubleshooting support, and other functions using newer faster DataSpeed-40 terminals.\n\nThis system was documented in the Bell System Technical Journal and AT&T internal Bell System Practices during the 1970s.\n"}

Later, in 2014, the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN in Portuguese), under the overview of the Ministry of Culture of Brazil, officially announced of a project of recognition, survey and support to the maintenance of the local language.\n\nSão Pedro do Butiá, also known simplesmente as \"Butiá\" in Portuguese or \"Butioo\" in German, has a popular pioneer village park called \"Centro Germânico Missioneiro\" (here \"missioneiro\" is a reference to the old Jesuit Missions, established in the general area during colonial times, around three hundred years before the more modern settlement of the area). The village has many different structures, like a general store, a country school, and some relocated old homes which are all set around a large statue of Saint Peter, the patron saint of this mostly catholic municipality. According to official information, the 30 meters tall statue of St. Peter is the same size as the world-famous statue of Christ the Redeemer, found at the top of the Sugarloaf Mountain in the city of Rio de Janeiro. \n\nThe church of São Pedro Apóstolo (St. Peter Apostle) of São Pedro do Butiá is a very good example of the neo-gothic architecture which prevailed and characterizes most of the earlier larger religious structures in the Germanic regions in the Northwest of the state. Even more impressive is its parish church: \n\nThe main church Paróquia Sagrada Família de Narazé (Sacred Family of Nazareth Church) is a much larger and a two-towered neo-gothic construction.

It was proved by and, independently, by Danny Calegari and David Gabai. It is one of the fundamental properties of geometrically infinite hyperbolic 3-manifolds, together with the density theorem for Kleinian groups and the ending lamination theorem.\nIt also implies the Ahlfors measure conjecture.\n\nTopological tameness may be viewed as a property of the ends of the manifold, namely, having a local product structure. An analogous statement is well known in two dimensions, i.e. for surfaces. However, as the example of Alexander horned sphere shows, there are wild embeddings among 3-manifolds, so this property is not automatic.\n\nThe conjecture was raised in the form of a question by Albert Marden, who proved that any \"geometrically finite\" hyperbolic 3-manifold is topologically tame. The conjecture was also called the Marden conjecture or the tame ends conjecture.\n\nThere had been steady progress in understanding tameness before the conjecture was resolved. Partial results had been obtained by Thurston, Brock, Bromberg, Canary, Evans, Minsky, Ohshika. An important sufficient condition for tameness in terms of splittings of the fundamental group had been obtained by Bonahon.\n\nThe conjecture was proved in 2004 by Ian Agol, and independently, by Danny Calegari and David Gabai. Agol's proof relies on the use of manifolds of pinched negative curvature and on Canary's trick of \"diskbusting\" that allows to replace a compressible end with an incompressible end, for which the conjecture has already been proved. The Calegari–Gabai proof is centered on the existence of certain closed, non-positively curved surfaces that they call \"shrinkwrapped\".\n\n"}

It is notable for being the first movie to have been shot inside the United Nations Headquarters in New York City.\n\nThe movie opens in a dusty African landscape: the Republic of Matobo, where rebel leader Ajene Xola (Curtiss Cook) is driving two men, Simon and Philippe, to the abandoned Centennial Stadium. They briefly discuss how President Edmond Zuwanie (Earl Cameron)'s regime has ruthlessly exterminated most of the population, and intimidated the survivors into silence. Upon their arrival at the stadium, they discover that the informants are schoolboys, who point Ajene and Simon in the direction of corpses left by Zuwanie's security apparatus, while Philippe stays in the car.\n\nShouting lures Ajene and Simon back to the field, where they are promptly executed by the boys, who are revealed to be willing accomplices of Zuwanie's secret police. Upon hearing the gunshots, Philippe clambers out of the car and hides, taking pictures of a car arriving carrying Matoban officials, and then escapes the vicinity.\n\nMeanwhile, Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations in New York City. Born in the United States to a British mother and white African father, she spent most of her life in her father's homeland of Matobo (a stand-in for Zimbabwe), studied music in Johannesburg, lingustics at Sorbonne University, Paris, and various other European countries, and is a dual citizen of both Matobo and the United States (with the possibility of deriving British citizenship through her mother). Her diverse background leads to UN Security Chief Lee Wu (Clyde Kusatsu) wryly describing her as \"being the UN\".\n\nThe U.N. is considering indicting Zuwanie, to stand trial in the International Criminal Court. Initially a liberator, over the past 20 years he has become as corrupt and tyrannical as the government he overthrew, and is now responsible for ethnic cleansing and other atrocities within Matobo. Zuwanie is soon to visit the U.N. and put forward his own case to the General Assembly, in an attempt to avoid the indictment.\n\nA security scare caused by a malfunctioning metal detector forces the evacuation of the U.N. building, and, as Silvia returns at night to reclaim some personal belongings, she overhears two men discussing an assassination plot in Ku (the Matoban lingua franca). Silvia runs from the building when those discussing the plot become aware of her presence. The next day, Silvia recognizes words in a meeting, where she is interpreting, from phrases she overheard the night before, and reports the incident to U.N. security; the plot's target appears to be Zuwanie himself. \n\nThey, in turn, call in the U.S. Secret Service, which assigns Dignitary Protection Division agents Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) and Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) to investigate, as well as protect Zuwanie when he arrives, as well as Zuwanie's personal head of security, Dutch mercenary Nils Lud (Jesper Christensen). Keller, whose estranged wife was accidentally killed just days earlier, learns that Silvia has, in the past, been involved in a Matoban guerrilla group, that her parents and sister were killed by land mines laid by Zuwanie's men, and that she has dated one of Zuwanie's political opponents. Although Keller is suspicious of Silvia's story, the two grow close, in part because of their shared grief, and Keller ends up protecting her from attacks on her person. \n\nPhilippe calls Silvia to meet and informs her of Xola's death, but, unable to bear her grief, lies and says he doesn't know what happened to Simon (her brother). Silvia attempts to obtain information by way of Kuman-Kuman, an exiled Matoban minister living in New York, only to almost be killed in a bus bombing perpetrated by Gabonese national Jean Gamba, Nils Lud's right-hand man, and part of the opening scene's coterie.\n\nPhilippe is later found dead in his hotel room, and Silvia finds out that her brother was killed along with Ajene Xola (as shown in the opening scene). She narrowly avoids an assassination attempt by Gamba (who Tobin kills) and leaves a voicemail on Tobin's phone saying she's going back home. Keller takes this to mean she's returning to Matobo, and dispatches an agent to intercept her at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nThe purported assassin is discovered (and shot to death) while Zuwanie is in the middle of his address to the General Assembly, and security personnel rush Zuwanie to a safe room for his protection. Silvia, anticipating this, has been hiding in the safe room, and confronts Zuwanie and intends to kill him herself. Keller determines that the assassination plot is a false flag operation created by Zuwanie to gain credibility that his rivals are terrorists and to deter potential supporters of his removal. Keller realizes that for Silvia, returning home to Matobo would not be possible without Zuwanie being removed from the equation, and rushes to the safe room, just in time to prevent Silvia from murdering Zuwanie. Zuwanie is indicted, and Silvia reconciles with Tobin before leaving for Matobo.\n\n\n\"The Interpreter\" was shot almost entirely in New York City. The opening sequence was shot in Mozambique with a support crew made up largely of South African nationals.\n\nParts of \"The Interpreter\" were filmed inside the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council chambers. The producers approached the U.N. about filming there before, but their request was turned down. The production would have relocated to Toronto with a constructed set; however, this would have substantially increased costs, and so Sydney Pollack approached then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan directly, and personally negotiated permission to film inside the United Nations. Annan commented on \"The Interpreter\" that \"the intention was really to do something dignified, something that is honest and reflects the work that this Organization does. And it is with that spirit that the producers and the directors approached their work, and I hope you will all agree they have done that.\"\n\nAmbassadors at the U.N. had hoped to appear in the film, but actors were asked to play the roles of diplomats. Spain's U.N. Ambassador Inocencio Arias jokingly complained that his \"opportunity to have a nomination for the Oscar next year went away because of some stupid regulation.\"\n\nThe country \"Republic of Matobo\" and its corresponding constructed language \"Ku\" were created for this film. The director of the \"Centre for African Language Learning\" in Covent Garden, London, England, Said el-Gheithy, was commissioned in January 2004 to create Ku. It is based on Bantu languages spoken in Eastern and Southern Africa, and is a cross between Swahili and Shona, with some unique elements.\n\nIn Ku, the film's tagline \"The truth requires no translation\" is \"Angota ho ne njumata\".\n\n\"The Interpreter\" earned mixed reviews from critics, as it now holds a 56% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 192 reviews.\n\nThe picture was No. 1 In its opening weekend. According to Box Office Mojo, \"The Interpreter\" had a domestic gross of $72,708,161 and an international tally of $90,236,762, bringing the picture's worldwide gross to $162,944,923 versus an $80 million budget, so the film was considered a box office success.\n\nIn 2005, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awarded Catherine Keener as Best Supporting Actress for her performances in several films, including \"The Interpreter\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "81816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81816", "title": "The Languages of Pao", "text": "The Languages of Pao\n\nThe Languages of Pao is a science fiction novel by American writer Jack Vance, first published in 1958, in which the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is a central theme. A shorter version was published in \"Satellite Science Fiction\" in late 1957. After the Avalon Books hardcover appeared the next year, it was reprinted in paperback by Ace Books in 1966 and reissued in 1968 and 1974. Additional hardcover and paperback reprints have followed, as well as British, French and Italian editions.\n\nThe planet Pao is a quiet backwater with a large, homogeneous, stolid population ruled by an absolute monarch: the Panarch. Pao's cultural homogeneity contributes to making it vulnerable to external military and economic pressures. The current Panarch attempts to hire an offworld scientist, Lord Palafox from the Breakness Institute on the planet Breakness, as a consultant in order to reform Pao. Before the deal can be concluded, however, the Panarch is assassinated by his brother Bustamonte, using mind-control over the Panarch's own son, Beran Panasper, to do so. Lord Palafox saves Beran Panasper and takes him to Breakness as a possible bargaining chip in his dealings with Pao.\n\nSomewhat later, the predatory Brumbo Clan from the planet Batmarsh raids the virtually defenseless Pao with impunity, and the Panarch Bustamonte is forced to pay heavy tribute. To rid himself of the Brumbos, he seeks the aid of Palafox, who has a plan to create warrior, technical and mercantile castes on Pao using customized languages (named Valiant, Technicant and Cogitant) and other means to shape the mindsets of each caste, isolating them from each other and the general populace of Pao. To achieve this, each caste gets a special training area where it is completely segregated from any outside influence; the necessary land is confiscated from families, some of which have held it for countless generations — which creates some disaffection in the conservative Paonese population and earns Bustamonte the name of a tyrant.\n\nIn order to return with them to Pao incognito, Beran Panasper infiltrates a corps of interpreters being trained on Breakness. Mostly to amuse themselves, some of the young people create a language they call \"Pastiche\", mixing words and grammatical forms, seemingly at random, from the three newly created languages and from the original Paonese language. Palafox looks upon this development with indulgence, failing to realize the tremendous long-term significance.\n\nBeran returns to Pao under the name Ercolo Paraio and works for a few years as a translator at several locations. Once Beran Panasper reveals to the masses that he is still alive, his uncle Bustamonte's popular support melts virtually overnight and Panasper claims the title of Panarch that is rightfully his. The Brumbo Clan is repulsed by the warrior caste. For a few years, the castes of Pao are highly successful in their respective endeavors and the planet experiences a short golden age. However, Panasper is upset about the divisions in the populace of Pao caused by the Palafox program; the three new castes speak of the rest of the Paonese as \"they\" rather than \"we\" and regard them with contempt.\n\nBeran attempts to return the planet to its previous state by re-integrating the castes into the general populace. Palafox opposes this move and is killed, but the warrior caste stages a coup and takes command of Pao. Panasper convinces them that they cannot rule the planet alone, since they share no common language with the rest of the population and cannot rely on the cooperation of the other segments of the people of Pao, and they allow him to keep his office.\n\nOne interpretation of the end of the novel is that Beran Panasper is only in nominal charge of the planet, on the sufferance of the warrior caste, and that it is uncertain what will become of him and his plans of re-uniting the populace of Pao. Another way of seeing the ending is that Beran has outfoxed the warriors by getting them to agree to his decree that \"every child of Pao, of whatever caste, must learn Pastiche even in preference to the language of his father\". In the end, Beran looks ahead twenty years, to a future when all inhabitants of Pao will be Pastiche-speakers — i.e., will speak a language which mixes some attributes and mindsets appropriate to peasant cultivators, proud warriors, skilled technicians and smart merchants — which will presumably shape a highly fluid and socially mobile society, composed of versatile and multi-skilled individuals.\n\nFrederik Pohl reported that Vance had \"pretty carefully\" worked out his extrapolation, but that \"it isn't terribly convincing as presented\". Pohl also noted that \"Vance writes well -- sometimes even brilliantly\", but that his prose sometimes seemed uneven and artificial. Floyd C. Gale called the novel \"a good idea well handled\". David Langford cited Vance's \"engaging speculation\", but concluded that the protagonist \"seems too weak a character for his leading role\", while \"the culture and landscape of Pao are grey and ill-defined, in strong contrast to the exotically colourful societies and ecologies which became Vance's trademark\".\n\nIn linguistics, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis asserts that a language's structure and grammar construct the perception and consciousness of its speakers.\n\nThis novel centers on a fictional experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. As the mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: \"We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language.\" His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: \"every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind.\"\n\nVance uses some unusual euphemisms in this book.\n"}
{"id": "26260610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26260610", "title": "Universal grinder", "text": "Universal grinder\n\nIn linguistics, the term \"universal grinder\" refers to an idea that in some languages, most count nouns can be used as if they were mass nouns, which causes a slight change in their meaning. The term \"universal grinder\" was first used in print by F. Jeffry Pelletier in 1975, after a personal suggestion by David Lewis.\n\nRelated concepts, the universal sorter and universal packager refer to similar processes that allow mass nouns to be used as count nouns.\n\nThe idea of the \"universal grinder\" is that while count nouns usually denote whole, distinct objects (such as \"a steak\", \"two steaks\"), the equivalent mass noun connotes a non-distinct quantity of whatever constitutes these objects (\"some steak\"). The universal grinder suggests that most count nouns can be used as mass nouns, and the distinct thing named by the noun will be thought of as a general quantity.\n\nWhile the \"universal grinder\" can be used in many Indo-European languages, most particularly English and Dutch, it does not apply in all languages; there is considerable cross-linguistic variation in the morphology and semantics of the mass/count and singular/plural distinctions. For example, bare count nouns in Mandarin Chinese do not receive mass interpretations: a sentence such as \"Qiáng-shang dōu shì gǒu\" can only be interpreted as 'There are dogs all over the wall,' not as 'There is dog all over the wall.'\n\nThe \"universal sorter\" describes one way in which mass nouns are understood when they are used in the plural. Harry Bunt suggested the universal sorter in his 1981 doctoral dissertation. When an ordinarily uncountable noun such as \"wine\" appears with plural form (\"several wines\"), it can be understood as referring to various abstract kinds (for example, varieties of wine).\n\nThe \"universal packager\" likewise describes how mass nouns are understood when they are used as countable nouns. In this case, the plural noun may be understood as naming individual servings or \"packages\" (e.g. \"two coffees\" may mean \"two cups of coffee\"), or as naming abstract kinds (\"two coffees\" can also refer to e.g. Colombian coffee and Indonesian coffee). Some scholars use the phrase \"universal packager\" to refer to both the concrete and abstract understanding of plural nouns; others use it to refer only to the concrete sense, and use \"universal sorter\" for abstract meaning.\n"}

As of 2005, it appears that a few speakers may have migrated across the Peruvian-Colombian border near the town of Leticia. A third of the population is monolingual, and Yagua is the language of instruction in local primary schools.\n\nThe exonym is spelled \"Yagua, Yawa, Yahua, Llagua, Yava, Yegua\". They also go by \"Nijyamïï Nikyejaada\".\n\nThe Yagua language is a branch of the Peba–Yaguan language family.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, there were about 6,000 speakers of the language. At that time, a majority of Yagua individuals were bilingual in both Spanish and the Yagua language. A few distant communities were still largely monolingual, and children were learning the language, though in at least some communities there was parental pressure on children to just speak Spanish. Some ethnic Yaguas are monolingual in Spanish.\n\nThere is some degree of semilingualism among certain Yagua women who are culturally assimilated into the main Peruvian culture, not having native-like command of either Spanish or Yagua. They contrast with three other groups of Yagua: 1) older women who are fluent Yagua speakers with some degree of Spanish, 2) unassimilated monolingual Yaguas, and 3) men, who all speak Yagua with varying degrees of Spanish fluency. These young women are primarily addressed in Yagua, but respond in a simplified Spanish.\n\nYagua has 6 vowels and 11 consonants, as shown in the chart below. (Orthographic symbols in bold, IPA values in square brackets.)\n\n\n\nThe language has either tone or a complex pitch-accent system, but this has never been adequately described.\n\nThe language is highly agglutinative, such that most words consist of multiple morphemes, and a single word may contain more than one root.\n\nMost Yagua sentences begin with the verb, followed by the subject and object in that order (VSO). It is a \"double object\" language, with no known syntactic differences between the two objects of verbs like 'give', for example, or applied objects.\n\nThe language has numerous postpositions (and no prepositions, which is generally unexpected for VSO languages). There are over 40 noun classifiers, and essentially no \"adjectives\". Nouns are modified either by nouns, by classifiers, or by other suffixes.\n\nYagua uses adjective-like nouns as adjectives. The problem then occurs in a sentence like \"the red hen\", which would be more like \"the red one, the hen\". Both \"the red one\" and \"the hen\" could be the head of the noun phrase. This is solved by determining which of the two nouns persists in the following discourse. If \"the red one\" persists, then \"red\" is the head; if \"the hen\" persists, then \"hen\" is the head. The order of elements is sensitive to determining the head.\n\nThe language is documented in various works by Paul Powlison, Esther Powlison, Doris L. Payne, and Thomas E. Payne.\n\nYagua has a quinary (base 5) counting system. Different numbers are used for inanimate objects/counting and animate objects (see measure word).\n\n"}
