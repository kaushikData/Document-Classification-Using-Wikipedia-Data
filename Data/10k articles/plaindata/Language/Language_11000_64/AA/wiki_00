She is best known for her series of children's stories about the experiences of a small girl called Alie growing up in the fictional location Rivierplaas in rural Free State. Late in life she published a novel for adults, \"Die afdraand van die dag is kil\" (The close of the day is cold, 1992), about two women in old age.\n\nAlba Bouwer was herself brought up on a farm in the Free State, and attended La Rochelle Girls' High School in Paarl, and Huguenot University College in Wellington. Most of her professional life was spent in literary and media circles in and around Cape Town.\n\nImmediately after graduation Bouwer began work as a school teacher, but she left teaching to become editor of \"Huishouding\", a newly established women's magazine. From 1948 to 1950 she was a radio producer and presenter in the children's service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, resigning in 1950 to take up an assistant editorship at the newly founded women's magazine \"Sarie\", where she remained for thirteen years.\n\nHer first and best known work of fiction, \"Stories van Rivierplaas\", originally appeared in serialised form in \"Sarie\". Like many of her stories, these were semi-autobiographical. She continued to produce stories, translations and compilations into the late 1980s, but gave up her career in journalism upon marriage in 1963.\n\nBouwer's first husband was Hubert Coetzee (died 1969), a widower with two teenaged children from his previous marriage. Care for her stepchildren became Bouwer's first priority as wife and as widow. In 1975 she remarried with Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, a widower with five children from his previous marriage, and moved from the Boland to Riversdale.\n\nSince 1994 she lived in a retirement resort in Somerset West. On 5 October 2010 Alba Bouwer fell into a coma and died.\n\nAlba Bouwer was awarded the Scheepers Prize for Children's Literature in 1959 and again in 1965, and the C.P.

{"id": "943457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=943457", "title": "Atomic sentence", "text": "Atomic sentence\n\nIn logic, an atomic sentence is a type of declarative sentence which is either true or false (may also be referred to as a proposition, statement or truthbearer) and which cannot be broken down into other simpler sentences. For example, \"The dog ran\" is an atomic sentence in natural language, whereas \"The dog ran and the cat hid.\" is a molecular sentence in natural language.\n\nFrom a logical analysis, the truth or falsity of sentences in general is determined by only two things: the logical form of the sentence and the truth or falsity of its simple sentences. This is to say, for example, that the truth of the sentence \"John is Greek and John is happy\" is a function of the meaning of \"and\", and the truth values of the atomic sentences \"John is Greek\" and \"John is happy\". However, the truth or falsity of an atomic sentence is not a matter that is within the scope of logic itself, but rather whatever art or science the content of the atomic sentence happens to be talking about.\n\nLogic has developed artificial languages, for example sentential calculus and predicate calculus partly with the purpose of revealing the underlying logic of natural languages statements, the surface grammar of which may conceal the underlying logical structure; see Analytic Philosophy. In these artificial languages an Atomic Sentence is a string of symbols which can represent an elementary sentence in a natural language, and it can be defined as follows.\n\nIn a formal language, a well-formed formula (or wff) is a string of symbols constituted in accordance with the rules of syntax of the language. A term is a variable, an individual constant or a n-place function letter followed by n terms. An atomic formula is a wff consisting of either a sentential letter or an n-place predicate letter followed by n terms. A sentence is a wff in which any variables are bound. An atomic sentence is an atomic formula containing no variables. It follows that an atomic sentence contains no logical connectives, variables or quantifiers. A sentence consisting of one or more sentences and a logical connective is a compound (or molecular) sentence. See \"vocabulary\" in First-order logic\n\nIn the following examples:\n\nThese wffs are atomic sentences; they contain no variables or conjunctions:\nThese wffs are atomic formulae, but are not sentences (atomic or otherwise) because they include free variables:\nThese wffs are compound sentences. They are sentences, but are not atomic sentences because they are not atomic formulae:\nThese wffs are compound formulae. They are not atomic formulae but are built up from atomic formulae using logical connectives. They are also not sentences because they contain free variables:\nA sentence is either true or false under an interpretation which assigns values to the logical variables. We might for example make the following assignments:\n\nIndividual Constants\nPredicates:\n\nSentential variables:\n\nUnder this interpretation the sentences discussed above would represent the following English statements:\n\nSentences in natural languages can be ambiguous, whereas the languages of the sentential logic and predicate logics are precise. Translation can reveal such ambiguities and express precisely the intended meaning.\n\nFor example, take the English sentence “Father Ted married Jack and Jill”. Does this mean Jack married Jill? In translating we might make the following assignments:\nIndividual Constants\nPredicates:\nUsing these assignments the sentence above could be translated as follows:\nTo establish which is the correct translation of “Father Ted married Jack and Jill”, it would be necessary to ask the speaker exactly what was meant.\n\nAtomic sentences are of particular interest in philosophical logic and the theory of truth and, it has been argued, there are corresponding atomic facts. An Atomic sentence (or possibly the \"meaning\" of an atomic sentence) is called an elementary proposition by Wittgenstein and an atomic proposition by Russell:\n\nNote the distinction between an \"elementary/atomic proposition\" and \"an atomic fact\"\n\nNo atomic sentence can be deduced from (is not entailed by) any other atomic sentence, no two atomic sentences are incompatible, and no sets of atomic sentences are self-contradictory. Wittgenstein made much of this in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. If there are any atomic sentences then there must be \"atomic facts\" which correspond to those that are true, and the conjunction of all true atomic sentences would say all that was the case, i.e. \"the world\" since, according to Wittegenstein, \"The world is all that is the case\". (TLP:1). Similarly the set of all sets of atomic sentences corresponds to the set of all possible worlds (all that could be the case).\n\nThe T-schema, which embodies the theory of truth proposed by Alfred Tarski, defines the truth of arbitrary sentences from the truth of atomic sentences.\n\n\n"}

It is a Hong Kong internet slang that originated from the discussion on Instagram and The Golden Forum (Chinese:香港高登討論區)\n\nInvolved cybercitizens claim that beauty beggars have these following characteristics: some of the introductions are self-contradictory or of poor quality; the declaration of interest is lacking in the presentations; they overcharge sponsorship either from public relations agencies or cosmetics companies; etc.\n\nTsui Yuen (Chinese:徐緣), a Hong Kong columnist who specialises in marketing, pointed out that the nature of a beauty beggar is the abuse of the \"Word of Mouth\" marketing model. Also, Janice Wong, a Hong Kong fashion critic, holds the opinion that the prototype of beauty beggar is the advertorial on \"personal media\"(Chinese:自媒體) platform.\n\nIn 2014, after some cybercitizens reported beauty beggars to the Customs and Excise Department in Hong Kong, the spokesman of Hong Kong Customs announced that they would follow up the case, for the beauty beggars might have violated section 13E of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, which covers \"misleading omissions\". The official indicated that different cases vary so more investigation and evidence is required to make fair judgements.\n\nBeauty beggars originated from some local beauty bloggers in Hong Kong, who are keen on sharing their experiences of using some beauty products with other cybercitizens. With their followers accumulating, some beauty bloggers that are more popular may be invited by some public relations agencies or cosmetics companies to promote beauty products. Thus, even if the product is not effective, these beauty bloggers may still give positive reviews on it. Some beauty bloggers were found to disguise the products that they get from public relations agencies as self-purchased products so as to raise the credibility of the promoting products. Moreover, some famous bloggers might sell the samples that they obtained from public relations agencies to viewers so as to earn extra profits. Customers who bought those products then discovered that they did not work or might cause allergic problems. Also, some beauty bloggers price their blog, Facebook page, or YouTube video to ask for extra sponsorship from involved companies. Therefore, some cybercitizens criticize them as “beauty beggars”.\n\nDue to the increasing trend of using social networking sites like YouTube and web blogs, people love to share their experience of using various products or collect useful information for daily life uses. In addition to the increasing popularity of social network, the continuous inflow of cosmetics and skin care products,especially from Korea and Taiwan, has raise the needs of beauty information for potential customers. Customers believe that they can rely on beauty bloggers' experience to choose the beauty products that suit them most. This in turn created a need for beauty bloggers. Beauty bloggers use either videos or texts to comment on different brands of beauty products after use. Thus, their audience can use their reviews or self-used reports as references before purchasing those beauty products.\nSome public relation agencies invited them to recommend some products by giving them some testers, but the article they wrote are similar to advertisements, since they simply give positive comments on those products.\n\nAs YouTube becomes more popular, the sharing form transfers from writing articles to making videos, so many beauty bloggers became beauty YouTubers, who are likely to be paid according to the number of likes for their YouTube clips. It was reported that some of the popular beauty YouTubers even ask for 40,000 to 50,000 Hong Kong Dollar for each YouTube clip.\n\nSome cybercitizens created Facebook pages and BBS website to show their objections to beauty beggars. In order to gather related information and propaganda, cybercitizens also established their fan club on YouTube platform and set up their database in Google Document and Instagram. In 2014, after some cybercitizens posted on the Golden Forum claiming that they obtained evidences of beauty beggars' behind-the-scenes deals, some beauty bloggers were caught up in some human flesh search (Chinese: 人肉搜索; 起底) cases.\nMany Hong Kong cybercitizens showed their opposition to the beauty beggars, and some of them listed several reasons for opposing them. A famous blogger summarized these reasons why people are against beauty beggars according to their voices:\n\n"}

They were spoken by tribal groups of the central United States, from present-day North Dakota south to Oklahoma. In the 21st century, they are critically endangered, as the number of native speakers has declined markedly. \n\nFive languages belong to the Caddoan language family:\n\nKitsai and Wichita are both extinct. Kitsai went extinct in the 19th century as its members were absorbed into the Wichita tribe. Wichita went extinct in 2016 when the last native speaker of Wichita, Doris McLemore (who left recordings and language materials), died.\n\nAll of the other Caddoan languages are nearly extinct; as of 2007, Caddo is spoken by only 25 people, Pawnee by 10, and Arikara by 10. Caddo and Pawnee are spoken in Oklahoma by small numbers of tribal elders. Arikara is spoken on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota.\n\nSpeakers of some of the languages were formerly more widespread; the Caddo, for example, used to live in northeastern Texas, southwestern Arkansas, and northwestern Louisiana, as well as southeastern Oklahoma. The Pawnee formerly lived along the Platte River in what is now Nebraska.\n\nGlottochronology is a controversial method of reconstructing, in broad detail, the history of a language and its relationships. In the case of Proto-Caddoan, it appeared to have divided into two branches, Northern and Southern, more than 3000 years ago. (The division of the language implies also a geographic and/or political separation.)\n\nSouth Caddoan, or Caddo proper, evolved in north-eastern Texas and adjacent Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Other than Caddo, no daughter languages are known, but some unrecorded ones likely existed in the 16th and the 17th centuries.\n\nNorthern Caddoan evolved into several different languages. The language that became Wichita, with several different dialects, branched off about 2000 years ago. Kitsai separated from the Northern Caddoan stem about 1200 years ago, and Pawnee and Arikara separated 300 to 500 years ago.\n\nAdai, a language isolate known only from a 275-word list collected in 1804, may be a Caddoan language. The documentation is too scanty to determine with certainty. The Adai lived in Louisiana. The language of the Eyeish or Ais, who lived adjacent to the Caddo, was a distinct language, but was probably related to Caddoan. (An unrelated people, also called the Ais, lived in Florida.)\n\nSome linguists believe that the Caddoan, Iroquoian, and Siouan languages may be connected in a Macro-Siouan language family, but their work is suggestive and the theory remains hypothetical. Similar attempts to find a connection with the Algonquian languages have been inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence for linguists to propose a hypothetical Macro-Algonquian/Iroquoian language family.\n\n\n"}

It may be a given model of item that is not selling well, or in the case of the final closure of a retailer because of a relocation, a fire (fire sale), extra inventory, or especially because of a bankruptcy. In the latter case, it is usually known as a going-out-of-business sale, and is part of a liquidation. A \"hail sale\" is a closeout at a car dealership after hail damage. Often, when the store is shutting down, they let people know that this is their last chance to buy the merchandise. However, often it's companies that can't sell their inventory, inventors that had a bad idea or businesses that are looking for fast cash flow to pay their bills such as payroll, etc.\nA closeout store is a retailer specializing in buying closeout items wholesale from other retailers and selling them at a discount. Big Lots is a well-known closeout store chain in the U.S., but other stores such as TJ Maxx, Ross Dress For Less, Marshalls, and Value City are also common, specializing more in clothing and housewares.\nSome clearance merchandise is non-returnable at some stores, as the intent is of course to get rid of the items. This is especially the case with liquidation and store-closing sales. However, in many jusrisdictions such as the United Kingdom, consumers retain their usual rights during a sale, such as the right to return faulty goods (under the Sale of Goods Act 1979) and the right to return goods granted by the Distance Selling Regulations.\n\nRather than storing merchandise until the following year, almost every U.S. store also has post-holiday clearance sales now, sometimes starting even before the holiday (especially Christmas and Halloween). Early discounts are often around 25%, but range from zero to as much as 50%, particularly if the \"regular\" prices were deliberately inflated as some stores do. 50% is common just after the holiday, often followed by 75%, and sometimes even 90%, at which point there is very little if anything left to choose from. Often during after-Christmas clearance sales, they let people know that this is their chance to buy everything they didn't get for Christmas, or as the phrase goes, \"everything Santa Claus forgot.\" Particularly in Canada, “Boxing Day sales” draw large crowds of shoppers seeking after-Christmas closeout deals.\n\nSome stores do pack-up holiday merchandise after going 50% off for a week or so, but often fail to remove the items from shelves before going back to regular price, especially if the items are non-perishable. A few merchants actually get credit back from vendors if they do not sell certain merchandise (this, in turn, is more common with perishable merchandise, such as fresh food), who in turn may sell it to a closeout store at reduced prices.\n\nSome customers take note of when specific retailers normally mark down merchandise further, showing up at the store on the very first day for the best selection. More general seasonal merchandise (such as winter clothing or summer patio furniture) is also put on clearance, but at more irregular times, making way for new fashions and fads.\n\nEven thrift stores have \"rolling\" closeouts. In this case, all merchandise put out in a given week is given a colored tag, or a letter to indicate what color if the item is directly marked with a grease pencil. During the last week before the color is used again, everything marked in that color is discounted, usually by 50%. At the end of the week, all remaining item with that tag color are removed from the shelves. There are typically four colors, so that all merchandise is rotated every month or so. Some independent stores may use other similar systems, such as using more colors, and possibly marking down a color by 25% the week before it goes 50% off.\n\nClearance sales typically occur on clearance racks in brick-and-mortar stores. Stores typically place merchandise on a clearance rack and mark the price down until someone purchases the item. This clearance sale can be further enhanced by using banners and signs, both on the interior and exterior of the store. This process has been replicated on the internet. The defunct drop.com was the first clearance website to mimic a retail store clearance rack by allowing sellers to automatically mark down their items to a pool of consumers.\n\n"}

This main character sets an example of how one should act, and the dastan becomes a teaching tool — for example the Sufi master and Turkic poet Ahmet Yesevi said \"Let the scholars hear my wisdom, treating my words like a dastan\".

A drive is an \"excitatory state produced by a homeostatic disturbance\", an instinctual need that has the power of driving the behaviour of an individual.\n\nDrive theory is based on the principle that organisms are born with certain psychological needs and that a negative state of tension is created when these needs are not satisfied. When a need is satisfied, drive is reduced and the organism returns to a state of homeostasis and relaxation. According to the theory, drive tends to increase over time and operates on a feedback control system, much like a thermostat.\n\nIn psychoanalysis, drive theory ( or \"\") refers to the theory of drives, motivations, or instincts, that have clear objects. When an internal imbalance is detected by homeostatic mechanisms, a drive to restore balance is produced. In 1927, Sigmund Freud said that a drive theory was what was lacking most in psychoanalysis. He was opposed to systematics in psychology, rejecting it as a form of paranoia, and instead classified drives with dichotomies like Eros/Thanatos drives, the drives toward life and death, respectively, and sexual/ego drives.\n\nFreud's \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" was published in Germany in 1930, when the rise of fascism in that country was well under way, and the warnings of a second European war were leading to opposing calls for rearmament and pacifism. Against this background, Freud wrote \"In face of the destructive forces unleashed, now it may be expected that the other of the two 'heavenly forces,' eternal Eros, will put forth his strength so as to maintain himself alongside of his equally immortal adversary.\"\n\nIn 1947, Hungarian psychiatrist and psychologist Leopold Szondi aimed instead at a systematic drive theory. Szondi Drive Diagram has been described as a revolutionary addition to psychology, and as paving the way for a theoretical psychiatry and a psychoanalytical anthropology.\n\nIn early attachment theory, behavioural drive reduction was proposed by Dollard and Miller (1950) as an explanation of the mechanisms behind early attachment in infants. Behavioural drive reduction theory suggests that infants are born with innate drives, such as hunger and thirst, which only the caregiver, usually the mother, can reduce. Through a process of classical conditioning, the infant learns to associate the mother with the satisfaction of reduced drive and is thus able to form a key attachment bond. However, this theory is challenged by the work done by Harry Harlow, particularly the experiments involving the maternal separation of rhesus monkeys, which indicate that comfort possesses greater motivational value than hunger.\n\nIn social psychology, drive theory was used by Robert Zajonc in 1965 as an explanation of the phenomenon of social facilitation. The audience effect notes that, in some cases, the presence of a passive audience will facilitate the better performance of a task, while in other cases the presence of an audience will inhibit the performance of a task. Zajonc's drive theory suggests that the variable determining direction of performance is whether the task is composed of a correct dominant response (that is, the task is perceived as being subjectively easy to the individual) or an incorrect dominant response (perceived as being subjectively difficult).\n\nIn the presence of a passive audience, an individual is in a heightened state of arousal. Increased arousal, or stress, causes the individual to enact behaviours that form dominant responses, since an individual's dominant response is the most likely response, given the skills which are available. If the dominant response is correct, then social presence enhances performance of the task. However, if the dominant response is incorrect, social presence produces an impaired performance.\n\nSuch behaviour was first noticed by Triplett (1898) while observing the cyclists who were racing together versus cyclists who were racing alone. It was found that the mere presence of other cyclists produced greater performance. A similar effect was observed by Chen (1937) in ants building colonies. However, it was not until Zajonc investigated this behaviour in the 1960s that any empirical explanation for the audience effect was pursued.\n\nZajonc's drive theory is based on an experiment involving the investigation of the effect of social facilitation in cockroaches. Zajonc devised a study in which individual cockroaches were released into a tube, at the end of which there was a light. In the presence of other cockroaches as spectators, cockroaches were observed to achieve a significantly faster time in reaching the light than those in the control, no-spectator group. However, when cockroaches in the same conditions were given a maze to negotiate, performance was impaired in the spectator condition, demonstrating that incorrect dominant responses in the presence of an audience impair performance.\n\nCottrell's evaluation apprehension model later refined this theory to include yet another variable in the mechanisms of social facilitation. He suggested that the correctness of dominant responses only plays a role in social facilitation when there is an expectation of social reward or punishment based on performance. His study differs in design from Zajonc's as he introduced a separate condition in which participants were given tasks to perform in the presence of an audience that was blindfolded, and thus unable to evaluate the participant's performance. It was found that no social facilitation effect occurred, and hence the anticipation of performance evaluation must play a role in social facilitation. Evaluation apprehension, however, is only key in human social facilitation and is not observed in other animals.\n\n"}

It is closely related to Caribbean Hindustani and the Hindustani spoken in Mauritius and South Africa.\n\nThis is the speaking percentage of each language and dialect that indentured labourers who came to Fiji spoke.\nIndian indentured labourers, spoke mainly dialects from the Hindi Belt. Initially, the majority of labourers came to Fiji from districts of central and eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, while a small percentage hailed from North-West Frontier and South India such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nOver time, a distinct Indo-Aryan language with an Eastern Hindi substratum developed in Fiji, combining elements of the Hindi languages spoken in these areas with some native Fijian and English. The development of Fiji Hindi was accelerated by the need for labourers speaking different languages to work together and by the practice of leaving young children in early versions of day-care centers during working hours. Percy Wright, who lived in Fiji during the indenture period, wrote:\n\nOther writers, including Burton (1914) and Lenwood (1917), made similar observations. By the late 1920s all Fiji Indian children born in Fiji learned Fiji Hindi, which became the common language in Fiji of North and South Indians alike.\n\nLater, approximately 15,000 Indian indentured labourers, who were mainly speakers of Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Tulu, and Malayalam), were brought from South India. By this time Fiji Hindi was well established as the lingua franca of Indo-Fijians and the Southern Indian labourers had to learn it to communicate with the more numerous Northern Indians and their European overseers. After the end of the indenture system, Indians who spoke Gujarati and Punjabi arrived in Fiji as free immigrants. A few Indo-Fijians speak Tamil, Telugu, and Gujarati at home, but all are fluently conversant and able to communicate using Fiji Hindi. The census reports of 1956 and 1966 shows the extent to which Fiji Hindi (referred to as 'Hindustani' in the census) was being spoken in Indo-Fijian households.\n\nFiji Hindi is also understood and even spoken by Indigenous Fijians in areas of Fiji where there are large Indo-Fijian communities. Following the recent political upheaval in Fiji, a large number of Indo-Fijians have emigrated to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, where they have largely maintained their traditional Indo-Fijian culture, language, and religion.\n\nSome writers have begun to use Fiji Hindi, until very recently a spoken language only, as a literary language. The Bible has now been translated into Fiji Hindi, and the University of the South Pacific has recently begun offering courses in the language. Fiji Hindi is written using both the Latin script and the Devanāgarī script.\n\nA Fiji Hindi movie has also been produced depicting Indo-Fijian life and is based on a play by local playwright, Raymond Pillai.\n\nThe phonemes of Fiji Hindi are very similar to Standard Hindi, but there are some important distinctions. As in the Bhojpuri and Awadhi dialects of the Hindi Belt spoken in rural India, mainly Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh — the consonant \"sh\" is replaced with \"s\" (for example, \"saadi\" instead of \"shaadi\") and \"v\" replaced with \"b\" (for example, \"bid-es\" instead of \"videsh\"). There is also a tendency to ignore the differences between the consonants \"ph\" and \"f\" (In Fiji Hindi a fruit is \"fal\" instead of \"phal\") and between \"j\" and \"z\" (In Fiji Hindi land is \"jameen\" instead of \"zameen\"). The consonant \"n\" is used in Fiji Hindi for the nasal sounds \"ṅ\", \"ñ\" and \"ṇ\" in Standard Hindi. These features are common in the Eastern Hindi dialects.\nSome other characteristics of Fiji Hindi which is similar to Bhojpuri and Awadhi are:\n\nIn Fiji Hindi verb forms have been influenced by a number of Hindi dialects in India. First and second person forms of verbs in Fiji Hindi are the same, there is no gender distinction and number distinction is only in the third person past tense. Although, gender is used in third person past tense by the usage of \"raha\" for a male versus \"rahi\" for a female.\n\nThe use of the first and second person imperfective suffixes \"-taa\", \"-at\" are of Awadhi origin. \nExample: तुम मन्दिर जाता हैं / तुम मन्दिर जात हैं। \"tum Mandir jaata hai/tum Mandir jaat hai.\" (You are going to the Temple).\n\nWhile the third person imperfective suffix \"-e\" is of Bhojpuri origin. \nExample: ई बिल्ली मच्छरी खावे हैं। \"Ee billi macchari KHAWE hai.\" (This cat is eating a fish).\n\nThe third person perfective suffixes (for transitive verbs) \"-is\" and \"-in\" are also derived from Awadhi. \nExample: किसान गन्ना काटीस रहा। \"Kisaan ganna katees raha.\" (The farmer cut the sugarcane). \nपण्डित लोगन रामायण पढ़ीन रहा/पण्डित लोगन रामायण पढ़े रहीन। \"Pandit logan Ramayan padheen raha/padhe raheen.\" (The priests read the Ramayana).\n\nThe third person definite future suffix \"-ii\" is found in both Awadhi and Bhojpuri. \nExample: प्रधानमंत्री हमलोग के पैसा दई। \"Pradhanamantri humlog ke paisa daii\" (The prime minister will give us money).\n\nThe influence of Hindustani is evident in the first and second person perfective suffix \"-aa\" and the first and second person future siffix \"-ega\". \nExample: हम करा। तुम करेगा। \"Hum karaa, tum karega.\" (I did, you will do).\n\nThe origin of the imperative suffix \"-o\" can be traced to the Magahi dialect. \nExample: तुम अपन मुह खोलो। \"Tum apan muh khulo.\" (You open your mouth). Spoken in the Gaya and Patna districts, which provided a sizeable proportion of the first indentured labourers from Northern India to Fiji.\n\nFiji Hindi has developed its own polite imperative suffix \"-naa\". \nExample: आप घर के सफा कर लेना। \"Aap ghar ke sapha kar Lena.\" (You clean the house (polite)).\n\nThe suffix \"-be\", from Bhojpuri, is used in Fiji Hindi in emphatic sentences.\n\nAnother suffix originating from Awadhi is \"-it\". \nExample: ई लोगन पानी काहे नहीं पीत हैं। \"Ee logan paani kahey nahi peet hai.\" (Why aren't these people drinking water.\"\nbut is at present going out of use.\n\nFiji Hindi tenses are relatively similar to tenses in Standard Hindi. Bhojpuri and Awadhi influence the Fiji Hindi tenses. \n\n\nIndo-Fijians now use native Fijian words for those things that were not found in their ancestral India but which existed in Fiji. These include most fish names and root crops. For example, \"kanade\" for mullet (fish) and \"kumaala\" for sweet potato or yam. Other examples are:\n\nMany English words have also been borrowed into Fiji Hindi with sound changes to fit the Indo-Fijian pronunciation. For example, \"\" in Fiji Hindi is borrowed from hotel in English. Some words borrowed from English have a specialised meaning, for example, \"\" in Fiji Hindi means a playing field, \"\" in Fiji Hindi means a \"work gang\", particularly a cane-cutting gang in the sugar cane growing districts and \"\" in Fiji Hindi specifically means a female teacher. There are also unique Fijian Hindi words created from English words, for example, \"\" means cane-top.\n\nMany words of Hindustani origin have shifted meaning in Fiji Hindi. These are due to either innovations in Fiji or continued use of the old meaning in Fiji Hindi when the word is either not used in Standard Hindi anymore or has evolved a different meaning altogether. Some examples are:\n\nMany words of English origin have shifted meaning in Fiji Hindi.\n\nThough broadly based on standard Hindi, counting in Fiji Hindi reflects a number of cross-language and dialectal influences acquired in the past 125 years.\n\nThe pronunciation for numbers between one and ten show slight inflections, seemingly inspired by Bihari dialects such as Bhojpuri. The number two, consequently, is () in standard Hindi, while in Fiji Hindi it is \"dui\" (), just as it is in Bhojpuri.\n\nWords for numbers between 10 and 99 present a significant difference between standard and Fiji Hindi. While, as in other north Indian languages, words for are formed by mentioning units first and then multiples of ten, Fiji Hindi reverses the order and mentions the tens multiple first and the units next, as is the practice in many European and South-Indian languages. That is to say, while \"twenty-one\" in Standard Hindi is (), an internal sandhi of \"ek aur biis\", or \"one-and-twenty\", in Fiji Hindi the order would be reversed, and simply be \"biis aur ek\" (), without any additional morpho-phonological alteration. Similarly, while the number thirty-seven in standard Hindi is (), for \"saat aur tiis\" or \"seven-and-thirty\", the number would be \"tiis aur saat\" (), or 'thirty-and-seven' in Fiji Hindi.\n\nAdditionally, powers of ten beyond ten-thousand, \"lakh\" (100,000) and \"karor\" (10 million) are not used in Fiji Hindi.\n\nWith political upheavals in Fiji beginning with the first military coup in 1987, large numbers of Indo-Fijians have since migrated overseas and at present there are significant communities of Indo-Fijian expatriates in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. Smaller communities also reside on other Pacific Islands and Britain. The last census in each of the countries where Fiji Hindi is spoken (counting Indo-Fijians who were born in Fiji) provides the following figures:\n\n\n\n"}

It is generally longer and more detailed than an outline (or one-page synopsis), and it may include details of directorial style that an outline omits. Treatments read like a short story, but are told in the present tense and describe events as they happen. A treatment may also be created in the process of adapting a novel, play, or other pre-existing work into a screenplay.\n\nThe original draft treatment is created during the writing process, and is generally long and detailed. It consists of full-scene outlines put together. Usually there are between thirty and eighty standard letter size or A4 pages (Courier New 12 point), with an average of about forty pages. For example, \"The Terminator\" is forty-eight pages.\n\nMore elaborate forms of the draft treatment are the step outline and the scriptment.\n\nThe presentation treatment is created as presentation material. Generally the scene card descriptions are written out in order, and only have the essential and important story events that make up the scenes. It is the full story in its simplest form, moving from the concept, to the theme, to the character, to the detailed synopsis of about four to eight pages of master scenes.\n\nPresentation treatments are used to show how the production notes have been incorporated into the screenplay for the director and production executives to look over, or to leave behind as a presentation note after a sales pitch.\n\nThe presentation treatment is the appropriate treatment to submit if a script submission requires one. They are usually at least three, but under thirty, pages in length, with most being of seven to twelve pages.\n\nTreatments are widely used within the motion picture industry as selling documents to outline story and character aspects of a planned screenplay, whereas outlines are generally produced as part of the development process. Screenwriters may use a treatment to initially pitch a screenplay, but may also use a treatment to sell a concept they are pitching without a completed screenplay.\n"}
{"id": "33827596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33827596", "title": "Frequency format hypothesis", "text": "Frequency format hypothesis\n\nThe frequency format hypothesis is the idea that the brain understands and processes information better when presented in frequency formats rather than a numerical or probability format. Thus according to the hypothesis, presenting information as 1 in 5 people rather than 20% leads to better comprehension. The idea was proposed by German scientist Gerd Gigerenzer, after compilation and comparison of data collected between 1976–1997.\n\nCertain information about one's experience is often stored in the memory using an implicit encoding process. Where did you sit last time in class? Do you say the word hello or charisma more? People are very good at answering such questions without actively thinking about it or not knowing how they got that information in the first place. This was the observation that lead to Hasher and Zacks' 1979 study on frequency.\n\nThrough their research work, Hasher and Zacks found out that information about frequency is stored without the intention of the person. Also, training and feedback does not increase ability to encode frequency. Frequency information was also found to be continually registered in the memory, regardless of age, ability or motivation. The ability to encode frequency also does not decrease with old age, depression or multiple task requirements. They called this characteristic of the frequency encoding as automatic encoding.\n\nAnother important evidence for the hypothesis came through the study of infants. In one study, 40 newborn infants were tested for their ability to discriminate between 2 dots versus 3 dots and 4 dots versus 6 dots. Even though infants were able to make the discrimination between 2 versus 3 dots, they were not able to distinguish between 4 versus 6 dots. The tested new born infants were only 21 hours to 144 hours old.\n\nSimilarly in another study, to test whether infants could recognize numerical correspondences, Starkey et al. designed a series of experiments in which 6 to 8 month old infants were shown pairs of either a display of two objects or a display of three objects. While the displays were still visible, infants heard either two or three drumbeats. Measurement of looking time revealed that the infants looked significantly longer toward the display that matched the number of sounds.\n\nLater on, Barbara A. Spellmen from University of Texas describes the performance of humans in determining cause and effects as the contingency rule ΔP, defined as\n\nwhere P(E|C) is the probability of the effect given the presence of the proposed cause and P(E|~C) is the probability of the effect given the absence of the proposed cause. Suppose we wish to evaluate the performance of a fertilizer. If the plants bloomed 15 out of 20 times when the fertilizer was used, and only 5 out of 20 plants bloomed in the absence of the fertilizer. In this case\n\nThe ΔP value as a result is always bound between -1 and 1. Even though the contingency rule is a good model of what humans do in predicting one event causation of another, when it comes to predicting outcomes of events with multiple causes, there exists a large deviation from the contingency rule called the cue-interaction-effect.\n\nIn 1993 Baker Mercer and his team used video games to demonstrate this effect. Each test subject is given the task of helping a tank travel across a mine field using a button that sometimes worked correctly in camouflaging and sometimes did not. As a second cause a spotter plane, a friend or an enemy would sometimes fly over the tank. After 40 trials, the test subjects were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of the camouflage and the plane in helping the tank through the minefield. They were asked to give it a number between -100 to 100.\nMathematically, there are two contigency values possible for the plane: the plane was either irrelevant to tank's success, then ΔP=0(.5/0 condition) and the plane was relevant to the plane's success, ΔP=1 (.5/1 condition). Even though the ΔP for the camouflage in either condition is 0.5, the test subjects evaluated the ΔP of camouflage to be much higher in the .5/0 condition than in the .5/1 condition. The results are shown in table below.\nIn each case, the test subjects are very good in noticing when two events occur together. When the plane is relevant to the camouflage success, they mark the camouflage success high and when the plane doesn't affect the camouflage's success, they mark the camouflage's success value low.\n\nSeveral experiments have been performed that shows that ordinary and sometimes skilled people make basic probabilistic fallacies, especially in the case of Bayesian inference quizzes. Gigerenzer claims that the observed errors are consistent with the way we acquired mathematical abilities during the course of human evolution.\nGigerenzer argues that the problem with these quizzes is the way the information is presented. During these quizzes the information is presented in percentages. Gigerenzer argues that presenting information in frequency format would help in solving these puzzles accurately. He argues that evolutionary the brain physiologically evolved to understand frequency information better than probability information. Thus if the Bayesian quizzes were asked in frequency format, then test subjects would be better at it. Gigerenzer calls this idea the frequency format hypothesis in his published paper titled \"The psychology of good judgment: frequency formats and simple algorithms\".\n\nGigerenzer argued that from an evolutionary point of view, a frequency method was easier and more communicable compared to conveying information in probability format. He argues that probability and percentages are rather recent forms of representation as opposed to frequency. The first known existence of a representative form of percentages is in the seventeenth century. He also argues that more information is given in the case of frequency representation. For instance, instead of conveying data as 50 out of 100, using the frequency form, as opposed to saying 50%, using the probability format, gives the users more information about the sample size. This can in turn make the data and results more reliable and more appealing.\n\nAn explanation given as to why people choose encounter frequency is that in the case of frequencies, the subjects are given vivid descriptions, while with probabilities only a dry number is given to the subject. Therefore, in the case of frequency, subjects are given more recall cues. This could in turn mean that the frequency encounters are remembered by the brain more often than in the case of probability numbers. Thus this might be a reason why people in general intuitively choose frequency encountered choices rather than probability based choices.\n\nYet another explanation offered by the authors is the fact that in the case of frequency, people often come across them multiple times and have a sequential input, compared to a probability value, which is given in one time. From John Medina’s Brain Rules, sequential input can lead to a stronger memory than a onetime input. This can be a primary reason why humans choose frequency encounters over probability.\n\nAnother rationale provided in justifying the frequency format hypothesis is that using frequencies makes it easier to keep track and update a database of events. For example, if an event happened 3 out of 6 times, the probability format would store this as 50%, whereas in frequency format it is stored as 3 out of 6. Now imagine that the event does not happen this time. The frequency format can be updated to 3 out of 7. However, for the probability format updating is extremely harder.\n\nFrequency representation can also be helpful in keeping track of classes and statistical information. Picture a scenario where every 500 out of 1000 people die due to lung cancer. However, 40 of those 1000 were smokers and 20 out of the 40 had a genetic condition predisposed to possible lung cancer. Such class division and information storage can only be done using frequency format, since a number .05% probability of having lung cancer does not give any information or allow to calculate such information.\n\nCritics of the frequency format hypothesis argue that probability formats allow for much easier comparison than frequency format representation of data. In some cases, using frequency formats actually does allow for easy comparison. If team A wins 19 of its 29 games, and another team B wins 10 of its 29 games, one can clearly see that team A is much better than team B. However comparison in frequency format is not always this clear and easy.If team A won 19 out of its 29 games, comparing this team with team B that won 6 out of its 11 games becomes much harder in frequency format. But, in the probability format, one could say since 65.6%(19/29) is greater than 54.5%, one could much easily compare the two.\n\nTooby and Cosmides had argued that frequency representation helps update data easier each time one gets new data. However this involves updating both numbers. Referring back to the example of teams, if team A won its 31st game, note that both the number of games won(20->21) and the number of games played(30->31) has to be updated. In the case of probability the only number to be updated is the single percentage number. Also, this number could be updated over the course of 10 games instead of updating each game, which cannot be done in the case of frequency format.\n"}

Other important colleagues and students of Saussure who comprise this school include Albert Sechehaye, Albert Riedlinger, Serge Karcevski and Charles Bally.\n\nThe most significant linguistic book connected with this school is \"Cours de linguistique générale\", the main work of de Saussure, which was published by his students Charles Bally and Albert Sehechaye. The book was based on lectures with this title that de Saussure gave three times in Geneva from 1906 to 1912. Sehechaye and Bally did not themselves take part in these lecture classes, but they used notes from other students. The most important of these students was Albert Riedlinger, who provided them with the most material. Furthermore, Bally and Sehechaye continued to develop de Saussure's theories, mainly focusing on the linguistic research of speech. Sehechaye also concentrated on syntactic problems.\n\nIn addition to his edition of de Saussure's lectures, Charles Bally also played an important role in linguistics. He lived from 1865 to 1947 and was, like de Saussure, from Switzerland. His parent were Jean Gabriel, a teacher and Henriette, the owner of a cloth store. Bally was married three times: first with Valentine Leirens, followed by Irma Baptistine Doutre, who was sent into a mental institution in 1915 and Alice Bellicot.\n\nFrom 1883 to 1885 he studied classic language and literature in Geneva. He continued his studies from 1886 to 1889 in Berlin where he was awarded a PhD. After his studies he worked as a private teacher for the royal family of Greece from 1889 to 1893. Bally returned to Geneva and taught at a business school from 1893 on and moved to the Progymnasium, a grammar school, from 1913 to 1939. At the same time, he worked as PD at the university from 1893 to 1913. Finally from 1913 to 1939 he had a professorship for general linguistic and comparative Indo-German studies which he took over from Ferdinand de Saussure.\n\nBesides his works about subjectivity in the French Language he also wrote about the crisis in French language and language classes.\nToday Charles Bally is regarded as the founding-father of linguistic theories of style and much honored for his theories of phraseology.\n\nWorks by Charles Bally:\n\nRecommended Literature about Bally's theories:\n\nThe expression \"Geneva School\" () is also applied to a group of literary critics in the 1950s and 1960s, of which the most important were the Belgian critic Georges Poulet, the French critic Jean-Pierre Richard, and the Swiss critics Marcel Raymond, Albert Béguin, Jean Rousset and Jean Starobinski. The critics Emil Staiger, Gaston Bachelard, and J. Hillis Miller are also sometimes associated with this group.\n\nGrowing out of Russian Formalism and Phenomenology (such as in the work of Edmund Husserl), the \"Geneva School\" used the phenomenological method to attempt to analyse works of literature as representations of deep structures of an author's consciousness and his or her relationship to the real world. Biographical criticism was however avoided, as these critics focused primarily on the work of art itself – treated as an organic whole and considered a subjective interpretation of reality (the German concept of \"Lebenswelt\") – and sought out the recurrent themes and images, especially those concerning time and space and the interactions between the self and others.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Similarly to other Arabic varieties, Gulf Arabic varieties are not completely mutually intelligible with other Arabic varieties spoken outside the Gulf. The specific dialects differ in vocabulary, grammar and accent. There are considerable differences between, for instance, Kuwaiti Arabic and the dialects of Qatar and the UAE—especially in accent, that may hinder mutual intelligibility.\n\nGulf varieties' closest related relatives are other dialects native to the Arabian Peninsula, i.e. Najdi Arabic and Bahrani Arabic. Although spoken over much of Saudi Arabia's area, Gulf Arabic is not the native tongue of most Saudis, as the majority of them do not live in Eastern Arabia.

{"id": "162699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162699", "title": "Heteronormativity", "text": "Heteronormativity\n\nHeteronormativity is the belief that people fall into distinct and complementary genders (male and female) with natural roles in life. It assumes that heterosexuality is the norm or default sexual orientation, and that sexual and marital relations are most (or only) fitting between people of opposite sex. A \"heteronormative\" view therefore involves alignment of biological sex, sexuality, gender identity and gender roles. Heteronormativity is often linked to heterosexism and homophobia.\n\nMichael Warner popularized the term in 1991, in one of the first major works of queer theory. The concept's roots are in Gayle Rubin's notion of the \"sex/gender system\" and Adrienne Rich's notion of compulsory heterosexuality. From the outset, theories of heteronormativity included a critical look at gender; Warner wrote that \"every person who comes to a queer self-understanding knows in one way or another that her stigmatization is intricated with gender. [...] Being queer [...] means being able, more or less articulately, to challenge the common understanding of what gender difference means.\"\n\nIn a series of articles, Samuel A. Chambers calls for an understanding of heteronormativity as a concept that reveals the expectations, demands, and constraints produced when heterosexuality is taken as normative within a society.\n\nCritics of heteronormative attitudes, such as Cathy J. Cohen, Michael Warner, and Lauren Berlant, argue that they are oppressive, stigmatizing, marginalizing of perceived deviant forms of sexuality and gender, and make self-expression more challenging when that expression does not conform to the norm. Heteronormativity describes how social institutions and policies reinforce the presumption that people are heterosexual and that gender and sex are natural binaries. Heteronormative culture privileges heterosexuality as normal and natural and fosters a climate where LGBT individuals are discriminated against in marriage, tax codes, and employment. Following Berlant and Warner, Laurie and Stark also argue that the domestic \"intimate sphere\" becomes \"the unquestioned non-‐place that anchors heteronormative public discourses, especially those concerning marriage and adoption rights\".\n\nAccording to cultural anthropologist Gayle Rubin, heteronormativity in mainstream society creates a \"sex hierarchy\" that graduates sexual practices from morally \"good sex\" to \"bad sex.\" The hierarchy places reproductive, monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as \"good\" and places any sexual acts and individuals who fall short of this standard lower until they fall into \"bad sex.\" Specifically, this places long-term committed gay couples and promiscuous gays in between the two poles. Patrick McCreery, lecturer at New York University, views this hierarchy as partially explanatory for the stigmatization of gay people for socially \"deviant\" sexual practices that are often practiced by straight people as well, such as consumption of pornography or sex in public places. There are many studies of sexual orientation discrimination on college campuses.\n\nMcCreery states that this heteronormative hierarchy carries over to the workplace, where gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals face discrimination such as anti-homosexual hiring policies or workplace discrimination that often leaves \"lowest hierarchy\" individuals such as transsexual people vulnerable to the most overt discrimination and unable to find work.\n\nApplicants and current employees can be legally passed over or fired for being non-heterosexual or \"perceived\" as non-heterosexual in many countries, such as the case with chain restaurant Cracker Barrel, which garnered national attention in 1991 after they fired an employee for being openly lesbian, citing their policy that employees with \"sexual preferences that fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values were inconsistent with traditional American values.\" Workers such as the fired employee and others, such as effeminate male waiters (allegedly described as the true targets), were legally fired by work policies \"transgressing\" against \"normal\" heteronormative culture.\n\nAnalysing the interconnectivity of heteronormativity and sexual employment discrimination, Mustafa Bilgehan Ozturk traces the impact of patriarchal practices and institutions on the workplace experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual employees in a variety of contexts in Turkey, demonstrating further the specific historicities and localised power/knowledge formations that give rise to physical, professional and psycho-emotive acts of prejudice against sexual minorities.\n\nModern family structures in the past and present vary from what was typical of the 1950s nuclear family. The families of the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century in the United States were characterized by the death of one or both parents for many American children. In 1985, the United States is estimated to have been home to approximately 2.5 million post-divorce, stepfamily households containing children. During the late 80s, almost 20% of families with children headed by a married couple were stepfamilies.\n\nOver the past three decades rates of divorce, single parenting, and cohabitation have risen precipitously. Nontraditional families (which diverge from \"a middle-class family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother, married to each other and raising their biological children\") constitute the majority of families in the United States today. Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage (also known as Peer Marriage) where two heterosexual parents are both providers of resources and nurturers to children has become popular. Modern families may also have single-parent headed families caused by divorce, separation or death, families who have two parents who are not married but have children, or families with same-sex parents. With artificial insemination, surrogate mothers, and adoption, families do not have to be formed by the heteronormative biological union of a male and a female.\n\nThe consequences of these changes for the adults and children involved are heavily debated. In a 2009 Massachusetts spousal benefits case, developmental psychologist Michael Lamb testified that parental sexual orientation does not negatively affect childhood development. \"Since the end of the 1980s... it has been well established that children and adolescents can adjust just as well in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings,\" he argued. However, columnist Maggie Gallagher argues that heteronormative social structures are beneficial to society because they are optimal for the raising of children. Australian-Canadian ethicist Margaret Somerville argues that \"giving same-sex couples the right to found a family unlinks parenthood from biology\". Recent criticisms of this argument have been made by Timothy Laurie, who argues that both intersex conditions and infertility rates have always complicated links between biology, marriage and child-rearing.\n\nA subset of heteronormativity is the concept of heteronormative temporality. This ideology states that the ultimate life goal for society is heterosexual marriage. Societal factors influence adults to search for a partner of the opposite sex to engage in heterosexual marriage with the goal of having children through the traditional nuclear family structure. Heteronormative temporality promotes abstinence only until marriage. Many American parents adhere to this heteronormative narrative, and teach their children accordingly. According to Amy T. Schalet, it seems that the bulk of parent-child sex education revolves around abstinence only practices in the United States, but this differs in other parts of the world. Similarly, George Washington University Professor Abby Wilkerson discusses the ways in which the healthcare and medicinal industries reinforce the views of heterosexual marriage in order to promote heteronormative temporality. The concept of heteronormative temporality extends beyond heterosexual marriage to include a pervasive system where heterosexuality is seen as a standard, and anything outside of that realm is not tolerated. Wilkerson explains that it dictates aspects of everyday life such as nutritional health, socio-economic status, personal beliefs, and traditional gender roles.\n\nIntersex people have biological characteristics that are ambiguously either male or female. If such a condition is detected, intersex people in most present-day societies are almost always assigned a normative sex shortly after birth. Surgery (usually involving modification to the genitalia) is often performed in an attempt to produce an unambiguously male or female body, with the parents'—rather than the individual's—consent. The child is then usually raised and enculturated as a cisgender heterosexual member of the assigned sex, which may or may not match their emergent gender identity throughout life or some remaining sex characteristics (for example, chromosomes, genes or internal sex organs).\n\nTransgender people experience a mismatch between their gender identity or gender expression and their assigned sex. \"Transgender\" is also an umbrella term because, in addition to including trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex (and who are sometimes specifically termed \"transsexual\" if they desire medical assistance to transition), it may include genderqueer people (whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine, but may, for example, be bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender, and infrequently the term is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.\n\nSome transgender people seek sex reassignment therapy, and may not behave according to the gender role imposed by society. Some societies consider transgender behavior a crime worthy of capital punishment, including Saudi Arabia and many other nations. In some cases, gay or lesbian people were forced to undergo sex change treatments to \"fix\" their sex or gender: in some European countries during the 20th century, and in South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn some countries, including North American and European countries, certain forms of violence against transgender people may be tacitly endorsed when prosecutors and juries refuse to investigate, prosecute, or convict those who perform the murders and beatings (currently, in some parts of North America and Europe). Other societies have considered transgender behavior as a psychiatric illness serious enough to justify institutionalization.\n\nIn medical communities with these restrictions, patients have the option of either suppressing transsexual behavior and conforming to the norms of their birth sex (which may be necessary to avoid social stigma or even violence) or by adhering strictly to the norms of their \"new\" sex in order to qualify for sex reassignment surgery and hormonal treatments. Attempts to achieve an ambiguous or \"alternative\" gender identity would not be supported or allowed. Sometimes sex reassignment surgery is a requirement for an official gender change, and often \"male\" and \"female\" are the only choices available, even for intersex and transgender people. For governments which allow only heterosexual marriages, official gender changes can have implications for related rights and privileges, such as child custody, inheritance, and medical decision-making.\nHomonormativity is a term which can refer to the privileging of homosexuality or the assimilation of heteronormative ideals and constructs into LGBTQ culture and individual identity. Specifically, Catherine Connell states that homonormativity \"emphasizes commonality with the norms of heterosexual culture, including marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity\". The term is almost always used in its latter sense, and was used prominently by Lisa Duggan in 2003, although transgender studies scholar Susan Stryker, in her article \"Transgender History, Homonormativity, and Disciplinary\", noted that it was also used by transgender activists in the 1990s in reference to the imposition of gay/lesbian norms over the concerns of transgender people. Transgender people were not included in healthcare programs combating the AIDS epidemic, and were often excluded from gay/ lesbian demonstrations in Washington. Homonormativity has also grown to include transnormativity, or \"the pressure put on trans people to conform to traditional, oppositional sexist understandings of gender\". In addition, homonormativity can be used today to cover or erase the radical politics of the queer community during the Gay Liberation Movement, by not only replacing these politics with more conservative goals like marriage equality and adoption rights, but also commercializing and mainstreaming queer subcultures.\n\nAccording to Penny Griffin, Politics and International Relations lecturer at the University of New South Wales, homonormativity upholds neoliberalism rather than critiquing monogamy, procreation, and binary gender roles as inherently heterosexist and racist. In this sense, homonormativity is deeply intertwined with the expansion and maintenance of the internationally structured and structuring capitalistic worldwide system. Duggan asserts that homonormativity fragments LGBT communities into hierarchies of worthiness, and that LGBT people that come the closest to mimicking heteronormative standards of gender identity are deemed most worthy of receiving rights. She also states that LGBT individuals at the bottom of this hierarchy (e.g. bisexual people, trans people, non-binary people, people of non-Western genders, intersex people, queers of color, queer sex workers) are seen as an impediment to this class of homonormative individuals receiving their rights. For example, one empirical study found that in the Netherlands, transgender people and other gender non-conforming LGBT people are often looked down upon within their communities for not acting \"normal.\" Those who do assimilate often become invisible in society and experience constant fear and shame about the non-conformers within their communities. Stryker referenced theorist Jürgen Habermas and his view of the public sphere allowing for individuals to come together, as a group, to discuss diverse ideologies and by excluding the non-conforming LGBTQ community, society as a whole were undoubtedly excluding the gender-variant individuals from civic participation.\n\nFive different studies have shown that gay characters appearing on TV decreases the prejudice among viewers. Cable and streaming services are beginning to include more characters who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender than broadcast television. Cable and streaming services are lacking in diversity, according to a GLAAD report, with many of the LGBT characters being gay men (41% and 39% respectively). The total number of LGBT characters counted on cable was reported to be 31% up from 2015, and bisexual representations saw an almost twofold increase.\n\nIntersex people are excluded almost completely from television, though about 1% of the population is intersex. News medias outline what it means to be male or female, which causes a gap for anyone who doesn't fall into those two categories. Newspapers have covered the topic of intersex athletes with the case of Caster Semenya, where news spread on sporting officials having to determine whether she was to be considered female or male.\n\nIn today's media, specifically television, heterosexual character are used more often than homosexual characters. In 2018 only 8.8% of broadcast television has a LGBTQ person on the show. Media portray heterosexuality as “normal” in today's society so we see less homosexuality on television because of this. There are many stereotypes that come with this, as it can be seen in advertising, newspapers, radio, and television. For example, mainstream media promote the idea that gay men are more likely to be attracted to advertisements that sell expensive, flamboyant, and possibly feminine products because of their assumed attitudes and way of life. Homosexuals and heterosexuals are also differentiated in the movies as well. Homosexual characters are predominantly seen in movies with issues regarding sexuality and the character is presented as homosexual. Television shows are also another aspect of media where there are stereotypes and negatively represented homosexuals. For example, the TV show Modern Family has two gay characters that are married and have a small adopted child together. Some may see this relationship as degrading and stereotypical of how the mainstream media views homosexuals. The show's sexual politics are considered fake because of how their relationship is portrayed as overly colorful and excessively put together. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "369116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369116", "title": "Hume's fork", "text": "Hume's fork\n\nHume's fork is an explanation, developed by later philosophers, of David Hume's 1730s division of \"relations of ideas\" from \"matters of fact and real existence\". A distinction is made between necessary versus contingent (concerning reality), versus (concerning knowledge), and analytic versus synthetic (concerning language). Relations of abstract ideas align on one side (necessary, \"a priori\", analytic), whereas concrete truths align on the other (contingent, \"a posteriori\", synthetic).\n\nThe \"necessary\" is generally true in all possible worlds—usually by mere logical validity—whereas the \"contingent\" hinges on the way the real world is. The \"a priori\" is knowable before or without, whereas the \"a posteriori\" is knowable only after or through, experience in an area of interest. The \"analytic\" is a statement true by virtue of its terms' meanings, and therefore a tautology—necessarily true but uninformative—whereas the \"synthetic\" is true by its terms' meanings in relation to a state of facts. In other words, analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world. Philosophers have used the terms differently, and there is debate over whether there is a legitimate distinction. \n\nHume's strong empiricism, as in Hume's fork as well as Hume's problem of induction, was taken as a threat to Newton's theory of motion. Immanuel Kant responded with rationalism in his 1781 \"Critique of Pure Reason\", where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind's aligning the environmental input by arranging those sense data into the experience of space and time. Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic \"a priori\"—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume's fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis (Kant's pitchfork) and thus saving Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n\nIn 1919, Newton's theory fell to Einstein's general theory of relativity. In the late 1920s, the logical positivists rejected Kant's synthetic \"a priori\" and asserted Hume's fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a logical syntax entailing, as a consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and aprioricity, thus restricting science to claims verifiable as either false or true. In the early 1950s, Willard Van Orman Quine undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating ontological relativity, as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world. By the early 1970s, Saul Kripke established the necessary \"a posteriori\", since if the Morning Star and the Evening Star are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.\n\nHume's fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy. Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the \"No true Scotsman\" move. Simply put, Hume's fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume's distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning and Hume's law. Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as beliefs versus desires and as impressions versus ideas.\n\nThe first distinction is between two different areas of human study:\n\nHume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:\n\n\nIn modern terminology, members of the first group are known as analytic propositions and members of the latter as synthetic propositions. This terminology comes from Kant (Introduction to \"Critique of Pure Reason\", Section IV).\n\nInto the first class fall statements such as \"all bodies are extended\", \"all bachelors are unmarried\", and truths of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like \"the sun rises in the morning\", and \"all bodies have mass\".\n\nHume wants to prove that certainty does not exist in science. First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern brain in a vat theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.\n\nSecond, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: \"Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls.\" While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn't something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.\n\nThird, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement \"An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length.\" While some earlier philosophers (most notably Plato and Descartes) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.\n\nThe results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything about the world. Since they don't mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.\n\nIf accepted, Hume's fork makes it pointless to try to prove the existence of God (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world, making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement \"God exists,\" it doesn't really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume's fork voids the causal argument and the ontological argument for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume's fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. \n\nHume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:\nIf we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. — \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\"\n"}

At the end of this time he was jailed for four months for preaching against socialism during the Kulturkampf.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1885 he was pastor of Ss. Peter and Paul parish in Litzelstetten. He later wrote that the first seven years in Litzelstetten were among the happiest of his life.\n\nAt this time he was editor of the magazine \"Sionsharfe\", devoted mainly to Catholic poetry. In May 1879 he published an article on Volapük in this magazine. This sketch was followed by a full-length book in 1880. The language spread widely and new clubs sprung all over Europe. After 1885 Schleyer had to retire from his pastoral duties due to ill health, though he was still involved in the Volapük movement until it fell apart a few years later.\n\nIn 1894 Pope Leo XIII made him a papal prelate.\n\nSchleyer died in Konstanz in 1912.\n\nA campaign to beatify him was started in June 2001, based in his home parish of Litzelstetten.

He's mostly known for his sci-fi novel \"Mecanoscrit del segon origen\" (\"Typescript of the Second Origin\").\n\nManuel de Pedrolo was born in 1918 in L'Aranyó, in the Segarra comarca (county), in Catalonia. After the Spanish civil war he settled down in Barcelona, where he worked at a great number of jobs while writing as a background activity. From 1974, he was able to devote himself to literature, creating works, translating, and doing other minor editorial tasks. He died in Barcelona, in 1990, after suffering a long illness.\n\nDespite the fact that he is considered one of the most ambitious writers in Catalan, having cultivated virtually all literary genres, Manuel de Pedrolo is especially known for his vast production of prose, with more than 72 novels published between 1949 and 1985, many of which were detective novels. Most of them were thoroughly censored under the following terms: \"catalanism, political opinions, religion, sexual morality and indecorous language\". He also translated into Catalan works by John Dos Passos, William Faulkner and Jean-Paul Sartre. Throughout his life, he had several run-ins with Spanish fascists around censorship issues. He also received many awards and was bestowed with the highest honors in Catalan literature.\n\nPedrolo's name will remain forever attached to the title of his most popular work, his first attempt at the sci-fi genre, \"Mecanoscrit del segon origen\" (\"Typescript of the Second Origin\"). First published in 1974, it became the most broadly disseminated Catalan fiction book in the following decade, with 26 editions and more than 270,000 copies sold in 1986.\n\nThe novel narrates the story of two children from a little country village named Benaura in Catalonia, Spain. Alba, a fourteen-year-old girl, and Dídac, a black nine-year-old boy, become the two only remaining humans on Earth after they accidentally survive an alien holocaust that eradicates all mammal life on the planet. As Alba and Dídac bravely recover from the catastrophe, they not only insist on living in a post-apocalyptic world, inhabited by myriads of corpses and deranged, psychotic survivors, but they also take up the mission of preserving human culture and repopulating the Earth.\n\nAlthough the novel was not addressed to youngsters, the dramatic and yet romantically attractive position of the main characters made the \"Mecanoscrit\" very popular among teenagers, and even though it is compulsory reading in many Catalan highschools today, many young people will have already read it at an earlier age. From an adult perspective, Alba & Dídac's will to survive makes this novel a wonderful chant to life and hope. The well-documented scientific data and the use of cultured-but-readable language are just two of the reasons for the success of this book, which has had a deep impact on Catalan culture.\n\nAll contents in this article come from different editions of Manuel de Pedrolo's books: \n\n"}

The initial motivation for developing a shorter variant of science fiction prototyping was to provide a type of shorthand for capturing ideas (and the context) quickly, such as in a brain-storming meeting. µSFP was first proposed by Anasol Peña Rios, a researcher at the University of Essex, who used the methodology in support of a 2013 UK event for K12 students called \"The New Creatives\".\n\nThe most widely cited example of flash fiction is Ernest Hemingway's classic six word story \"\". Within the science and engineering community, the Creative Science Foundation has run a number of events that have produced examples of µSFPs such as from the New Creatives 2014 in Colchester \"\"Jack fall asleep in the sun. His smart sun protection sensor woke him up with an alarm & soft vibration. He avoids sun strokes!\" or from Creative Science 2014 in Shanghai \"Zoe, you've been my life-long friend on SentiBook; today the news feed reports most social network friends don't exist, are you real?\". The first example was written by a k12 student with a very practical eye on technical innovation whereas the second example was written by a researcher involved in advanced AI, pondering on the possibilities of it achieving the capability to masquerade as people, either openly or surreptitiously, opening up intriguing, if disturbing consequences for human society and relationships.\n\nThe core methodology of µSFP is the application of flash fiction as shorthand for describing innovative ideas for science, engineering, business and socio-political systems. Generally there are three components to a µSFP; the technology, a simple action and a person. Most literature on µSFP advocates the following steps for writing a µSFP:\n\nBecause of its technical roots, Twitter sized µSFPs (140 characters / 25 words) are more common. It is widely acknowledged that writing such ultra-short stories is difficult, so the general advice is to start big, then reduce it. As with larger science fiction prototyping, ideas can come from existing research, fiction or from people's imaginations. Adding a protagonist and context that illustrates the technology in use is an important feature of a µSFP since such prototypes not just describe ideas, but test them by illustrating usage. µSFPs have numerous uses such as teaching English as a foreign language, motivating pre-university students to take up STEM studies and producing real-world technical innovations.\n\n"}

This means that most employments (except for service to residents like schools and shops) are by the main company.\n\nThe term \"monotown\" is especially often used in Russia, where the Soviet planned economy created hundreds of monotowns in supposedly rational locations, often in geographically inhospitable areas. The situation in many of Russia's monotowns is highly problematic: they are entirely dependent on the competitiveness of a single company or factory, very unflexible and based on Soviet-era economics and technologies.\n\nMost monotowns were built essentially as residential extensions of particular enterprises (so called \"city-forming enterprises\"), their population being either engaged in the city-forming enterprise's manufacturing process, or providing various services to the former group. The core workforce in monotowns was largely formed by the centralized workforce distribution system (people being assigned to an enterprise for a certain number of years after completing the education - which essentially replaced tuition payment, or transferred from other enterprises) rather than by spontaneous migration processes, as it was the case in less specialized towns. Combined, these factors led to narrow and inflexible economies and an immobile workforce, by the standards of the market economy newly introduced into the country in late 1980s - early 1990s.\n\nBy the time the city-forming enterprises had been privatized and / or liquidated, the workforce management system already ceased to exist, so the leftover workforce could not be transferred to other regions retaining the living conditions, as it was done during the Soviet era following the liquidation of a no longer needed enterprise. Monotown residents proved to be hesitant to move away on their own and seek work elsewhere as well, mostly because the state housing distribution system lied almost dead at the time, and very low market value of their real estate didn't let them count on minimally comfortable apartments in any other developed town (agricultural sector was and is even more depressive in most regions of Russia, making countryside largely unattractive for the town-dwellers).\n\nAccording to a Russian government study conducted in 1999—2000, there were 467 cities and 332 smaller towns in Russia which could be classified as monotowns. The combined population of these towns was 25 million, or a sixth of the country's total population. The 900 monotown enterprises—most of them involved in heavy industries such as manufacturing, fuels, timber, pulp and metallurgy—accounted for more than 30% of industrial production.\n\nThe monotowns suffered greatly in the late-2000s recession, leading to mass unemployment in the cities. Having no other hope, people have only one option - to protest.\n\nIn one high-profile incident, in 2009 some 300 residents of the north-western town of Pikalyovo blocked a major highway to protest against large delays in the payments of wages. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin traveled to the city and ordered the owner of the city's dominant company BasEl Cement Pikalyovo, Oleg Deripaska to pay over 41 million rubles ($1.3 million) of wage arrears to the city's residents. The sum was paid out and the situation in the city calmed down, but questions remained about the long-term viability of the Pikalyovo plants.\n\nAs of 2018, the official list of Russian monotowns includes 319 populated places. Towns can be removed from the list, if the local economies are deemed to have become sufficiently diversified. In late 2017, 14 million Russians lived in officially designated monotowns. A Fund for the Development of Monotowns was established in 2014, to invest in infrastructure and promote economic diversification. The monotown list is divided into categories, depending on the socioeconomic situation. Monotowns are not necessarily economically stagnant: Norilsk has an above average employment rate, as well as relatively high salaries.\n\nRussia's largest monotown is Tolyatti, which has a population of 700,000. It is home to the large AvtoVAZ factory, which in late 2008 employed 106,000 people. AvtoVAZ is Russia's largest carmaker, accounting for 1% of the country's GDP. As of 2014, the AvtoVAZ is owned by Nissan-Renault, which uses even harsher workforce policies than the previous owner. However, the situation is somewhat aided by widespread of small-scale car parts producers and other small car-oriented enterprises in the region, which are providing many additional workplaces.\n\nDalnegorsk, located in the Russian Far East, is a monotown with a population of nearly 40,000 people. The town's economy is completely dominated by two mining and metallurgy companies: JSC Bor and JSC Dalpolimetal, both subsidiaries of OOO UK Russian mining company (RGRK). They produce zinc and lead concentrates as well as boric acid colemanite.\n\nThe Soviet planned economy aimed to establish industrial facilities in rational locations, based on military, political, bureaucratic and economic criteria. The goal was to maximise regional specialisation. The dominant enterprise was responsible not only for production, but for providing social services to the population, such as housing, child care, etc.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, most of the monotowns' dominant enterprises were privatised, and consequently many of them had gone bankrupt by the end of the 1990s, either deliberately (usually it was more profitable to sell the property of an enterprise than to keep it functioning) or due to uncompetitiveness, caused by the shrinkage of the home market outside the consumer goods sector, unrestricted import of low-cost industrial wares from China, Turkey or other countries and the lack of long-term investments by the private owners, who were for the most part interested in quick money rather than development or modernization.\n\nPrivate owners also mostly refused to provide social services to the populations of monotowns, referring to such practice as being \"economically inefficient\" - however, the government's attempt to delegate the responsibility of providing social services from the companies to the newly created local municipalities was mostly a failure, as they lacked resources to complete the transformation. That led to a radical decrease in quality of life in monotowns, which enjoyed higher-than-average wealth for the most part of the Soviet period.\n\n"}

{"id": "429487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429487", "title": "Old High German", "text": "Old High German\n\nOld High German (OHG, , German abbr. ) is the earliest stage of the German language, conventionally covering the period from around 700 to 1050. Coherent written texts do not appear until the second half of the 8th century, and some treat the period before 750 as \"prehistoric\" (including the Proto-Germanic language) and date the start of Old High German proper to 750 for this reason. There are, however, a number of Elder Futhark inscriptions dating to the 6th century (notably the Pforzen buckle), as well as single words and many names found in Latin texts predating the 8th century.\n\nDuring the Migration Period, the High German-speaking tribes settled in what became Alamannia, the Duchy of Bavaria and the Kingdom of the Lombards. At the same time the Franconian-speaking tribes settled the area between those two rivers before crossing the Rhine to conquer Northern Gaul, where, under the Merovingians, they created the Frankish kingdom, Francia, which eventually stretched down to the Loire.\n\nOld High German comprises the dialects of these groups which underwent the Second Sound Shift during the 6th Century, namely all of Elbe Germanic and most of the Weser-Rhine Germanic dialects.\n\nThe Franks in the western part of Francia (Neustria and western Austrasia) gradually adopted Gallo-Romance by the beginning of the OHG period, with the linguistic boundary later stabilised approximately along the course of the Meuse and Moselle in the east, and the northern boundary probably a little further south than the current boundary between French and Flemish. North of this line, the Franks retained their language, but it was not affected by the Second Sound Shift, which thus separated their Low Franconian variety (the ancestor of Dutch) from the more easterly Franconian dialects which formed part of Old High German.\n\nThe Saxons and the Frisians along the shores of North Sea were likewise not affected by the Second Sound Shift and a bundle of isoglosses in a similar location to the modern Benrath line marked the Northern limit of the sound shift and separated the dialect of the Franks from Old Saxon.\n\nIn the south, the Lombards, who had settled in Northern Italy, maintained their dialect until their conquest by Charlemagne in 774. After this the Germanic-speaking population, who were by then almost certainly bilingual, gradually switched to the Romance language of the native population, so that Langobardic had died out by the end of the OHG period.\n\nAt the beginning of the period, no Germanic language was spoken east of a line from Kieler Förde to the rivers Elbe and Saale, earlier Germanic speakers in the Northern part of the area having been displaced by the Slavs. This area did not become German-speaking again until the German eastward expansion (\"Ostkolonisation\") of the early 12th century, though there was some attempt at conquest and missionary work under the Ottonians.\n\nThe Alemannic polity was conquered by Clovis I in 496, and in the last twenty years of the 8th century Charlemagne subdued the Saxons, the Frisians, the Bavarians, and the Lombards, bringing all continental Germanic-speaking peoples under Frankish rule. While this led to some degree of Frankish linguistic influence, the language of both the administration and the Church was Latin, and this unification did not therefore lead to any development of a supra-regional variety of Frankish nor a standardized Old High German; the individual dialects retained their identity.\n\nOld High German literacy is a product of the monasteries, notably at St. Gallen, Reichenau Island and Fulda. Its origins lie in the establishment of the German church by Saint Boniface in the mid 8th century, and it was further encouraged during the Carolingian Renaissance in the 9th. \nThe dedication to the preservation of Old High German epic poetry among the scholars of the Carolingian Renaissance was significantly greater than could be suspected from the meagre survivals we have today (less than 200 lines in total between the \"Hildebrandslied\" and the \"Muspilli\"). Einhard tells how Charlemagne himself ordered that the epic lays should be collected for posterity. It was the neglect or religious zeal of later generations that led to the loss of these records. Thus, it was Charlemagne's weak successor, Louis the Pious, who destroyed his father's collection of epic poetry on account of its pagan content.\n\nRabanus Maurus, a student of Alcuin's and abbot at Fulda from 822, was an important advocate of the cultivation of German literacy. Among his students were Walafrid Strabo and Otfrid of Weissenburg.\n\nTowards the end of the Old High German period, Notker Labeo (d. 1022) was among the greatest stylists in the language, and developed a systematic orthography.\n\nThe main difference between Old High German and the West Germanic dialects from which it developed is that it underwent the High German consonant shift (also called the \"second consonant shift\" in relation to the similar but much earlier Grimm's law). This is generally dated approximately to the late 5th and early 6th centuries—hence dating its start to around 500. The result of this sound change is that the consonantal system of German remains different from all other West Germanic languages, including English and Low German. Grammatically, however, Old High German remained very similar to Old English, Old Dutch, and Old Saxon.\n\nBy the mid 11th century the many different vowels found in unstressed syllables had all been reduced to . Since these vowels were part of the grammatical endings in the nouns and verbs, their loss led to radical simplification of the inflectional grammar of German. For these reasons, 1050 is seen as the start of the Middle High German period, though in fact there are almost no texts in German for the next hundred years.\n\nExamples of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables:\n\nThere was no standard or supra-regional variety of Old High German—every text is written in a particular dialect, or in some cases a mixture of dialects. Broadly speaking, the main dialect divisions of Old High German seem to have been similar to those of later periods—they are based on established territorial groupings and the effects of the Second Sound Shift, which have remained influential until the present day. But because the direct evidence for Old High German consists solely of manuscripts produced in a few major ecclesiastical centres, there is no isogloss information of the sort on which modern dialect maps are based. For this reason the dialects may be termed \"monastery dialects\" (German \"Klosterdialekte\").\n\nThe main dialects, with their bishoprics and monasteries:\n\n\nIn addition, there are two poorly attested dialects:\n\nThe continued existence of a West Frankish dialect in the Western, Romanized part of Francia is uncertain. Claims that this might have been the language of the Carolingian court or that it is attested in the Ludwigslied, whose presence in a French manuscript suggests bilingualism, are controversial.\n\nThe charts show the vowel and consonant systems of the East Franconian dialect in the 9th century. This is the dialect of the monastery of Fulda, and specifically of the Old High German \"Tatian\". Dictionaries and grammars of OHG often use the spellings of the Tatian as a substitute for genuine standardised spellings, and these have the advantage of being recognizably close to the Middle High German forms of words, particularly with respect to the consonants.\n\nOld High German had five phonemic long vowels and six phonemic short vowels. Both occurred in stressed and unstressed syllables.\n\nNotes:\n\nOld High German diphthongs are indicated by the digraphs , , , , , .\n\nHere are enumerated the sound changes that transformed Common West Germanic into Old High German, not including the Late OHG changes which effected Middle High German \n\nGermanic had a simple two-tense system, with forms for a present and preterite. These were inherited by Old High German, but in addition OHG developed three periphrastic tenses: the perfect, pluperfect and future.\n\nThe periphrastic past tenses were formed by combining the present or preterite of an auxiliary verb (\"wësan\", \"habēn\") with the past participle. Initially the past participle retained its original function as an adjective and showed case and gender endings - for intransitive verbs the nominative, for transitive verbs the accusative. For example:\n\"After thie thö argangana warun ahtu taga\" (Tatian, 7,1)\n\"When eight days had passed\", literally \"After that then passed (away) were eight days\"\nLatin: \"Et postquam consummati sunt dies octo\" (Luke 2:21)\n\n\"phīgboum habeta sum giflanzotan\" (Tatian 102,2)\n\"someone had planted a fig tree\", literally \"fig-tree had certain (\"or\" someone) planted\"\nLatin: \"arborem fici habebat quidam plantatam\" (Luke 3:6)\nIn time, however, these endings fell out of use and the participle came to be seen no longer as an adjective but as part of the verb, as in Modern German.\n\nThis development is generally taken to be the result of a need to translate Latin forms, but parallels in other Germanic languages (particularly Gothic, where the Biblical texts were translated from Greek, not Latin) raise the possibility that it was an independent development.\n\nGermanic also had no future tense, but again OHG created periphrastic forms, using an auxiliary verb \"skulan\" (Modern German \"sollen\") and the infinitive, or \"werden\" and the present participle:\n\n\"Thu scalt beran einan alawaltenden\" (Otfrid's Evangelienbuch I,5,23)\n\"You will bear an almighty [one]\"\n\n\"Inti nu uuirdist thu suigenti\"' (Tatian 2,9)\n\"And now you will start to fall silent\"\nLatin: \"Et ecce eris tacens\" (Luke 1:20)\n\nThe present tense continued to be used alongside these new forms to indicate future time (as it still is in Modern German).\n\nThe following is a sample conjugation of a strong verb, \"nëman\" \"to take\".\n\nThe early part of the period saw considerable missionary activity, and by 800 the whole of the Frankish Empire had, in principle, been Christianized. All the manuscripts which contain Old High German texts were written in ecclesiastical scriptoria by scribes whose main task was writing in Latin rather than German. Consequently, the majority of Old High German texts are religious in nature and show strong influence of ecclesiastical Latin on the vocabulary. In fact, most surviving prose texts are translations of Latin originals. Even secular works such as the are often preserved only because they were written on spare sheets in religious codices.\n\nThe earliest Old High German text is generally taken to be the Abrogans, a Latin–Old High German glossary variously dated between 750 and 780, probably from Reichenau. The 8th century Merseburg Incantations are the only remnant of pre-Christian German literature. The earliest texts not dependent on Latin originals would seem to be the and the Wessobrunn Prayer, both recorded in manuscripts of the early 9th century, though the texts are assumed to derive from earlier copies.\n\nThe Bavarian \"Muspilli\" is the sole survivor of what must have been a vast oral tradition. Other important works are the (Gospel harmony) of Otfrid von Weissenburg, the short but splendid and the 9th century . The boundary to Early Middle High German (from ) is not clear-cut.\n\nAn example of Early Middle High German literature is the .\n\nThe Lord's Prayer is given in four Old High German dialects below. Because these are translations of a liturgical text, they are best not regarded as examples of idiomatic language, but they do show dialect variation very clearly.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19896504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19896504", "title": "Old World wine", "text": "Old World wine\n\nOld World wine refers primarily to wine made in Europe but can also include other regions of the Mediterranean basin with long histories of winemaking such as North Africa and the Near East. The phrase is often used in contrast to \"New World wine\" which refers primarily to wines from New World wine regions such as the United States, Australia, South America and South Africa. The term \"Old World wine\" does not refer to a homogeneous style with \"Old World wine regions\" like Austria, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain each making vastly different styles of wine even within their own borders. Rather, the term is used to describe general differences in viticulture and winemaking philosophies between the Old World regions where tradition and the role of \"terroir\" lead versus the New World where science and the role of the winemaker are more often emphasized. In recent times, the globalization of wine and advent of flying winemakers have lessened the distinction between the two terms with winemakers in one region being able to produce wines that can display the traits of the other region—i.e. an \"Old World style\" wine being produced in a New World wine region like California or Chile and vice versa.\n\n\"Old World\" can also mean a wine style made for centuries by small winemakers intended to be consumed as a daily beverage to accompany a meal. These food and wine \"pairings,\" so famous today (e.g. Chianti and Italian food) developed over generations by trial and error. The small village winemaker succeeded or failed on his wine's reputation as an acceptable \"table\" wine, be it highly expensive or budget priced. \n\nBy comparison, \"New World\" wines, while also being food friendly, are created to meet the tastes of contemporary wine drinkers. Contemporary wine drinkers, especially those in the large U.S. market, consume wine as a stand alone beverage as much as a beverage to accompany a meal. Thus, the immediate \"taste\" is the overwhelming criteria by which a new-world wine is judged by the contemporary wine consumer.\n\nThe two most guiding influences of Old World style winemaking are that of tradition and \"terroir\". The former refers to the long history of a wine region, while the latter refers to geography and the unique characteristics of a place. The centuries-old histories of many Old World wine regions have given the regions time to develop and adapt techniques that presumably best suit a particular vine growing area. These can include which grape varieties to plant, trellising methods, maximum permitted yields, as well as winemaking techniques. Over time, these traditional practices became enshrined in local regulations such as the French \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC), Italian \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOC), Spanish \"Denominación de Origen\" (DO) and Portuguese \"Denominação de Origem Controlada\" (DOC) laws.\n\n\"Terroir\" is often used to describe the aspects of a wine region such as soil, climate and topography that are often out of the winemaker's control. They are the unique attributes that, theoretically, make a Sangiovese based wine from Chianti taste different from a Sangiovese-based wine made anywhere else in the world even if exactly the same winemaking techniques are used. While wines in the New World are often labeled based on the varietal (such as Chardonnay or Tempranillo), wines in the Old World are generally labeled based on the region or place that they come from (such as Montrachet or Ribera del Duero). This is because Old World winemakers believe that the unique \"terroir\"-driven characteristics of where a wine comes from plays a more distinct role in shaping the resulting wine than the grape variety itself.\n\nViticulture in most of the Old World wine regions dates back to several hundred or even thousands of years with the Phoenicians, Greeks, Thracians and Romans establishing some of the earliest vineyards. Over centuries, these Old World wine regions have developed viticultural techniques and practices adapted around their unique climates and landscapes. Many of these practices are enshrined in local wine laws and regulations such as the French \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) regulations. One distinction between an Old World vineyard and a New World vineyard is generally the high vine density and close proximity of plantings in the Old World, which were often planted years before the use of mechanical agriculture became popular. In regions such as Bordeaux, vines were often planted apart in rows that were also separated by with spacing that was sufficient for pruning and harvesting being done manually. In New World wine regions like Australia, which was quick to adopt mechanical techniques, vines were often planted apart by . While spacing between vine rows has shrunk in many Old World wine regions began adopting mechanical techniques in the late 20th century, some regions are still characterized by the high density of vines in their vineyards.\n\nOld World winemaking is often \"terroir\" driven with emphasis being placed on how well the wine communicates the sense of place where it originated. For example, a winemaker making a Riesling from the Mosel will often try to highlight the unique traits of the Mosel wine region (such as its slate soils) with the wine expressing those traits in the form of minerality. In the New World, emphasis is often placed on the winemaker and the techniques used to bring out the fruit flavors of a wine (a style known as \"fruit driven\"). New World winemakers tend to be more open to experimenting with new scientific advances (such as the use of enzymes as an additive) while the \"terroir\" influence of Old World winemakers will often attempt to downplay the role of the winemaker and avoid techniques that may mask or distort the expression of \"terroir\". Old World winemakers tend to be more open to use of wild, ambient yeast during the fermentation process as a part of the \"terroir\" while New World winemakers tend to favor cultured yeast strains.\n\nOther techniques associated with Old World winemakers include higher fermentation temperatures and a period of extended maceration following fermentation where the wine can leech more phenolic compounds from the grape skins. This can create more tannic and austere wines with more layers of complexity that require longer periods of bottle aging in order to mature. In contrast, the technique of transferring the must into oak barrels during fermentation and inducing malolactic fermentation early is more commonly associated with New World wine regions and wines that are softer and mature earlier.\n\nEuropean and Middle Eastern wine regions with a long history of viticulture are typically classified as \"Old World\". These include:\n"}

Rumi's influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions: Iranians, Tajiks, Turks, Greeks, Pashtuns, other Central Asian Muslims, and the Muslims of South Asia have greatly appreciated his spiritual legacy for the past seven centuries. His poems have been widely translated into many of the world's languages and transposed into various formats. Rumi has been described as the \"most popular poet\" and the \"best selling poet\" in the United States.\n\nRumi's works are written mostly in Persian, but occasionally he also used Turkish, Arabic, and Greek, in his verse. His Masnavi (Mathnawi), composed in Konya, is considered one of the greatest poems of the Persian language. His works are widely read today in their original language across Greater Iran and the Persian-speaking world. Translations of his works are very popular, most notably in Turkey, Azerbaijan, the United States, and South Asia. His poetry has influenced not only Persian literature, but also Turkish, Ottoman Turkish, Azerbaijani, as well as the literature of some other Turkic, Iranian, and Indo-Aryan languages including Chagatai, Urdu and Pashto.\n\nHe is most commonly called \"Rumi\" in English. His full name is \"Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Balkhī\" () or \"Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī\" (). \"Jalal ad-Din\" is an Arabic name meaning \"Glory of the Faith\". \"Balkhī\" and \"Rūmī\" are his \"nisbas\", meaning \"from Balkh\" and \"from Rûm\" (Roman Anatolia), respectively. According to the authoritative Rumi biographer Franklin Lewis of the University of Chicago, \"[t]he Anatolian peninsula which had belonged to the Byzantine, or eastern Roman empire, had only relatively recently been conquered by Muslims and even when it came to be controlled by Turkish Muslim rulers, it was still known to Arabs, Persians and Turks as the geographical area of Rum. As such, there are a number of historical personages born in or associated with Anatolia known as Rumi, a word borrowed from Arabic literally meaning 'Roman,' in which context Roman refers to subjects of the Byzantine Empire or simply to people living in or things associated with Anatolia.\"\n\nHe is widely known by the sobriquet \"Mawlānā\"/\"Molānā\" ( ) in Iran and popularly known as in Turkey. \"Mawlānā\" () is a term of Arabic origin, meaning \"our master\".\n\nThe term \"Mawlawī\"/\"Mowlavi\" (Persian) and (Turkish), also of Arabic origin, meaning \"my master\", is also frequently used for him.\n\nRumi was born to native Persian-speaking parents, originally from the Balkh, in present-day Afghanistan. He was born either in Wakhsh, a village on the Vakhsh River in present-day Tajikistan, or in the city of Balkh, in present-day Afghanistan.\n\nGreater Balkh was at that time a major centre of Persian culture and Sufism had developed there for several centuries. The most important influences upon Rumi, besides his father, were the Persian poets Attar and Sanai. Rumi expresses his appreciation: \"Attar was the spirit, Sanai his eyes twain, And in time thereafter, Came we in their train\" and mentions in another poem: \"Attar has traversed the seven cities of Love, We are still at the turn of one street\". His father was also connected to the spiritual lineage of Najm al-Din Kubra.\n\nRumi lived most of his life under the Persianate Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, where he produced his works and died in 1273AD. He was buried in Konya, and his shrine became a place of pilgrimage. Upon his death, his followers and his son Sultan Walad founded the Mevlevi Order, also known as the Order of the Whirling Dervishes, famous for the Sufi dance known as the Sama ceremony. He was laid to rest beside his father, and over his remains a shrine was erected. A hagiographical account of him is described in Shams ud-Din Ahmad Aflāki's \"Manāqib ul-Ārifīn\" (written between 1318 and 1353). This biography needs to be treated with care as it contains both legends and facts about Rumi. For example, Professor Franklin Lewis of the University of Chicago, author of the most complete biography on Rumi, has separate sections for the hagiographical biography of Rumi and the actual biography about him.\n\nRumi's father was , a theologian, jurist and a mystic from Balkh, who was also known by the followers of Rumi as Sultan al-Ulama or \"Sultan of the Scholars\". The popular hagiographical assertions that have claimed the family's descent from the Caliph Abu Bakr does not hold on closer examination and is rejected by modern scholars. The claim of maternal descent from the Khwarazmshah for Rumi or his father is also seen as a non-historical hagiographical tradition designed to connect the family with royalty, but this claim is rejected for chronological and historical reasons. The most complete genealogy offered for the family stretches back to six or seven generations to famous Hanafi jurists.\n\nWe do not learn the name of Baha al-Din's mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as \"Māmi\" (colloquial Persian for Māma), and that she was a simple woman who lived to the 1200s. The mother of Rumi was Mu'mina Khātūn. The profession of the family for several generations was that of Islamic preachers of the liberal Hanafi rite, and this family tradition was continued by Rumi (see his Fihi Ma Fih and Seven Sermons) and Sultan Walad (see Ma'rif Waladi for examples of his everyday sermons and lectures).\n\nWhen the Mongols invaded Central Asia sometime between 1215 and 1220, Baha ud-Din Walad, with his whole family and a group of disciples, set out westwards. According to hagiographical account which is not agreed upon by all Rumi scholars, Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic Persian poets, Attar, in the Iranian city of Nishapur, located in the province of Khorāsān. Attar immediately recognized Rumi's spiritual eminence. He saw the father walking ahead of the son and said, \"Here comes a sea followed by an ocean.\" He gave the boy his \"Asrārnāma\", a book about the entanglement of the soul in the material world. This meeting had a deep impact on the eighteen-year-old Rumi and later on became the inspiration for his works.\n\nFrom Nishapur, Walad and his entourage set out for Baghdad, meeting many of the scholars and Sufis of the city. From Baghdad they went to Hejaz and performed the pilgrimage at Mecca. The migrating caravan then passed through Damascus, Malatya, Erzincan, Sivas, Kayseri and Nigde. They finally settled in Karaman for seven years; Rumi's mother and brother both died there. In 1225, Rumi married Gowhar Khatun in Karaman. They had two sons: Sultan Walad and Ala-eddin Chalabi. When his wife died, Rumi married again and had a son, Amir Alim Chalabi, and a daughter, Malakeh Khatun.\n\nOn 1 May 1228, most likely as a result of the insistent invitation of 'Alā' ud-Dīn Key-Qobād, ruler of Anatolia, Baha' ud-Din came and finally settled in Konya in Anatolia within the westernmost territories of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm.\n\nBaha' ud-Din became the head of a madrassa (religious school) and when he died, Rumi, aged twenty-five, inherited his position as the Islamic molvi. One of Baha' ud-Din's students, Sayyed Burhan ud-Din Muhaqqiq Termazi, continued to train Rumi in the Shariah as well as the Tariqa, especially that of Rumi's father. For nine years, Rumi practised Sufism as a disciple of Burhan ud-Din until the latter died in 1240 or 1241. Rumi's public life then began: he became an Islamic Jurist, issuing fatwas and giving sermons in the mosques of Konya. He also served as a Molvi (Islamic teacher) and taught his adherents in the madrassa.\n\nDuring this period, Rumi also travelled to Damascus and is said to have spent four years there.\n\nIt was his meeting with the dervish Shams-e Tabrizi on 15 November 1244 that completely changed his life. From an accomplished teacher and jurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic.\n\nShams had travelled throughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could \"endure my company\". A voice said to him, \"What will you give in return?\" Shams replied, \"My head!\" The voice then said, \"The one you seek is Jalal ud-Din of Konya.\" On the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams was called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is rumoured that Shams was murdered with the connivance of Rumi's son, 'Ala' ud-Din; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the privilege of mystical friendship.\n\nRumi's love for, and his bereavement at the death of, Shams found their expression in an outpouring of lyric poems, \"Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi\". He himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damascus. There, he realised:\nMewlana had been spontaneously composing \"ghazals\" (Persian poems), and these had been collected in the \"Divan-i Kabir\" or Diwan Shams Tabrizi. Rumi found another companion in Salaḥ ud-Din-e Zarkub, a goldsmith. After Salah ud-Din's death, Rumi's scribe and favourite student, Hussam-e Chalabi, assumed the role of Rumi's companion. One day, the two of them were wandering through the Meram vineyards outside Konya when Hussam described to Rumi an idea he had had: \"If you were to write a book like the \"Ilāhīnāma\" of Sanai or the \"Mantiq ut-Tayr\" of 'Attar, it would become the companion of many troubadours. They would fill their hearts from your work and compose music to accompany it.\" Rumi smiled and took out a piece of paper on which were written the opening eighteen lines of his \"Masnavi\", beginning with:\n\nHussam implored Rumi to write more. Rumi spent the next twelve years of his life in Anatolia dictating the six volumes of this masterwork, the \"Masnavi\", to Hussam.\n\nIn December 1273, Rumi fell ill; he predicted his own death and composed the well-known \"ghazal\", which begins with the verse:\n\nRumi died on 17 December 1273 in Konya; his body was interred beside that of his father, and a splendid shrine, the \"Yeşil Türbe\" (Green Tomb, قبه الخضراء; today the Mevlâna Museum), was erected over his place of burial. His epitaph reads:\n\nGeorgian Queen Gürcü Hatun was a close friend of Rumi. She was the one who sponsored the construction of his tomb in Konya. The 13th century Mevlâna Mausoleum, with its mosque, dance hall, dervish living quarters, school and tombs of some leaders of the Mevlevi Order, continues to this day to draw pilgrims from all parts of the Muslim and non-Muslim world. Jalal al-Din who is also known as Rumi, was a philosopher and mystic of Islam.\n\nThe general theme of Rumi's thought, like that of other mystic and Sufi poets of Persian literature, is that of \"tawhid\" — union with the Beloved, from whom he sees himself as being cut off and aloof. His longing and desire to attain it is evident in the following poem from his book the Masnavi:\nThe \"Masnavi\" weaves fables, scenes from everyday life, Qur'anic revelations and exegesis, and metaphysics into a vast and intricate tapestry. In the East, it is said of him that he was \"not a prophet — but surely, he has brought a scripture.\"\n\nRumi believed passionately in the use of music, poetry and dance as a path for reaching God. For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of whirling Dervishes developed into a ritual form. His teachings became the base for the order of the Mevlevi, which his son Sultan Walad organised. Rumi encouraged Sama, listening to music and turning or doing the sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, \"samāʿ\" represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to the Perfect One. In this journey, the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth and arrives at the Perfect. The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey, with greater maturity, to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination with regard to beliefs, races, classes and nations.\n\nIn other verses in the \"Masnavi\", Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love:\n\nRumi's favourite musical instrument was the ney (reed flute).\n\nRumi's poetry is often divided into various categories: the quatrains (\"rubayāt\") and odes (\"ghazal\") of the \"Divan\", the six books of the \"Masnavi\". The prose works are divided into The Discourses, The Letters, and the \"Seven Sermons\".\n\n\n\nRumi belongs to the class of Islamic philosophers which include Ibn Arabi and Mulla Sadra. These transcendental philosophers are often studied together in traditional schools of irfan, philosophy and theosophy throughout the Muslim world.\n\nRumi embeds his theosophy (transcendental philosophy) like a string through the beads of his poems and stories. His main point and emphasis is the unity of being.\n\nIt is undeniable that Rumi was a Muslim scholar and took Islam seriously. Nonetheless, the depth of his spiritual vision extended beyond narrow understanding sectarian concerns. One rubaiyat reads:\nAccording to the Quran, Prophet Muhammad is a mercy sent by God to the Aalameen (to all creation), including humanity overall. In regards to this, Rumi states:\n\n\"The Light of Muhammad does not abandon a Zoroastrian or Jew in the world. May the shade of his good fortune shine upon everyone! He brings all of those who are led astray into the Way out of the desert.\"\n\nRumi, however, asserts the supremacy of Islam by stating:\n\n\"The Light of Muhammad has become a thousand branches (of knowledge), a thousand, so that both this world and the next have been seized from end to end. If Muhammad rips the veil open from a single such branch, thousands of monks and priests will tear the string of false belief from around their waists.\"\nMany of Rumi's poems suggest the importance of outward religious observance and the primacy of the Qur'an.\n\nRumi states:\n\n<poem>I am the servant of the Qur'an as long as I have life.\nI am the dust on the path of Muhammad, the Chosen one.\nIf anyone quotes anything except this from my sayings,\nI am quit of him and outraged by these words.</poem>\n\nRumi also states:\n\nOn the first page of the Masnavi, Rumi states:\n\"This is the book of the Masnavi, and it is the roots of the roots of the roots of the (Islamic) Religion and it is the Explainer of the Qur'ân.\"\n\nSeyyed Hossein Nasr states:\nOne of the greatest living authorities on Rûmî in Persia today, Hâdî Hâ'irî, has shown in an unpublished work that some 6,000 verses of the Dîwân and the Mathnawî are practically direct translations of Qur'ânic verses into Persian poetry.\n\nRumi states in his Dīwān:\nThe Sufi is hanging on to Muhammad, like Abu Bakr.\n\nHis Masnavi contains anecdotes and stories derived largely from the Quran and the hadith, as well as everyday tales.\n\nRumi's poetry forms the basis of much classical Iranian and Afghan music. Contemporary classical interpretations of his poetry are made by Muhammad Reza Shajarian, Shahram Nazeri, Davood Azad (the three from Iran) and Ustad Mohammad Hashem Cheshti (Afghanistan). To many modern Westerners, his teachings are one of the best introductions to the philosophy and practice of Sufism. In the West Shahram Shiva has been teaching, performing and sharing the translations of the poetry of Rumi for nearly twenty years and has been instrumental in spreading Rumi's legacy in the English-speaking parts of the world. Pakistan's National Poet, Muhammad Iqbal, was also inspired by Rumi's works and considered him to be his spiritual leader, addressing him as \"Pir Rumi\" in his poems (the honorific \"Pir\" literally means \"old man\", but in the Sufi/mystic context it means founder, master, or guide).\n\nShahram Shiva asserts that \"Rumi is able to verbalise the highly personal and often confusing world of personal growth and development in a very clear and direct fashion. He does not offend anyone, and he includes everyone... Today Rumi's poems can be heard in churches, synagogues, Zen monasteries, as well as in the downtown New York art/performance/music scene.\"\n\nAccording to Professor Majid M. Naini, \"Rumi's life and transformation provide true testimony and proof that people of all religions and backgrounds can live together in peace and harmony. Rumi’s visions, words, and life teach us how to reach inner peace and happiness so we can finally stop the continual stream of hostility and hatred and achieve true global peace and harmony.”\n\nRumi's work has been translated into many of the world's languages, including Russian, German, Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, Bengali, French, Italian, and Spanish, and is being presented in a growing number of formats, including concerts, workshops, readings, dance performances, and other artistic creations. The English interpretations of Rumi's poetry by Coleman Barks have sold more than half a million copies worldwide, and Rumi is one of the most widely read poets in the United States. Shahram Shiva book \"Rending the Veil: Literal and Poetic Translations of Rumi\" (1995, HOHM Press) is the recipient of the Benjamin Franklin Award.\n\nRecordings of Rumi poems have made it to the USA's Billboard's Top 20 list. A selection of American author Deepak Chopra's editing of the translations by Fereydoun Kia of Rumi's love poems has been performed by Hollywood personalities such as Madonna, Goldie Hawn, Philip Glass and Demi Moore.\n\nThere is a famous landmark in Northern India, known as Rumi Gate, situated in Lucknow (the capital of Uttar Pradesh) named for Rumi.\nRumi and his mausoleum were depicted on the reverse of the 5000 Turkish lira banknotes of 1981–1994.\n\nThese cultural, historical and linguistic ties between Rumi and Iran have made Rumi an iconic Iranian poet, and some of the most important Rumi scholars including Foruzanfar, Naini, Sabzewari, etc., have come from modern Iran. Rumi's poetry is displayed on the walls of many cities across Iran, sung in Persian music, and read in school books.\n\nThe Mewlewī Sufi order was founded in 1273 by Rumi's followers after his death. His first successor in the rectorship of the order was \"Husam Chalabi\" himself, after whose death in 1284 Rumi's younger and only surviving son, Sultan Walad (died 1312), popularly known as author of the mystical \"Maṭnawī Rabābnāma\", or the \"Book of the Rabab\" was installed as grand master of the order. The leadership of the order has been kept within Rumi's family in Konya uninterruptedly since then.\nThe Mewlewī Sufis, also known as Whirling Dervishes, believe in performing their \"dhikr\" in the form of Sama. During the time of Rumi (as attested in the \"Manāqib ul-Ārefīn\" of Aflākī), his followers gathered for musical and \"turning\" practices.\n\nAccording to tradition, Rumi was himself a notable musician who played the \"robāb\", although his favourite instrument was the \"ney\" or reed flute. The music accompanying the \"samāʿ\" consists of settings of poems from the \"Maṭnawī\" and \"Dīwān-e Kabīr\", or of Sultan Walad's poems. The Mawlawīyah was a well-established Sufi order in the Ottoman Empire, and many of the members of the order served in various official positions of the Caliphate. The centre for the Mevlevi was in Konya. There is also a Mewlewī monastery (, \"dargāh\") in Istanbul near the Galata Tower in which the \"samāʿ\" is performed and accessible to the public. The Mewlewī order issues an invitation to people of all backgrounds:\n\nDuring Ottoman times, the Mevlevi produced a number of notable poets and musicians, including Sheikh Ghalib, Ismail Rusuhi Dede of Ankara, Esrar Dede, Halet Efendi, and Gavsi Dede, who are all buried at the Galata Mewlewī Khāna (Turkish: \"Mevlevi-Hane\") in Istanbul. Music, especially that of the ney, plays an important part in the Mevlevi.\n\nWith the foundation of the modern, secular Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk removed religion from the sphere of public policy and restricted it exclusively to that of personal morals, behaviour and faith. On 13 December 1925, a law was passed closing all the \"tekke\"s (dervish lodges) and \"zāwiyas\" (chief dervish lodges), and the centres of veneration to which visits (\"ziyārat\") were made. Istanbul alone had more than 250 \"tekke\"s as well as small centres for gatherings of various fraternities; this law dissolved the Sufi Orders, prohibited the use of mystical names, titles and costumes pertaining to their titles, impounded the Orders' assets, and banned their ceremonies and meetings. The law also provided penalties for those who tried to re-establish the Orders. Two years later, in 1927, the Mausoleum of Mevlâna in Konya was allowed to reopen as a Museum.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Turkish government began allowing the Whirling Dervishes to perform once a year in Konya. The Mewlānā festival is held over two weeks in December; its culmination is on 17 December, the Urs of Mewlānā (anniversary of Rumi's death), called \"Šabe Arūs\" (شب عروس) (Persian meaning \"nuptial night\"), the night of Rumi's union with God. In 1974, the Whirling Dervishes were permitted to travel to the West for the first time. In 2005, UNESCO proclaimed \"The Mevlevi Sama Ceremony\" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nAs Edward G. Browne noted, the three most prominent mystical Persian poets Rumi, Sanai and Attar were all Sunni Muslims and their poetry abounds with praise for the first two caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattāb. According to Annemarie Schimmel, the tendency among Shia authors to anachronistically include leading mystical poets such as Rumi and Attar among their own ranks, became stronger after the introduction of Twelver Shia as the state religion in the Safavid Empire in 1501.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Rumi is known as \"Mawlānā\", in Turkey as \"Mevlâna\", and in Iran as \"Molavī\".\n\nAt the proposal of the Permanent Delegations of Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey, and as approved by its executive board and General Conference in conformity with its mission of “constructing in the minds of men the defences of peace”, UNESCO was associated with the celebration, in 2007, of the eight hundredth anniversary of Rumi's birth. The commemoration at UNESCO itself took place on 6 September 2007; UNESCO issued a medal in Rumi's name in the hope that it would prove an encouragement to those who are engaged in research on and dissemination of Rumi's ideas and ideals, which would, in turn, enhance the diffusion of the ideals of UNESCO.\n\nThe Afghan Ministry of Culture and Youth established a national committee, which organised an international seminar to celebrate the birth and life of the great ethical philosopher and world-renowned poet. This grand gathering of the intellectuals, diplomats, and followers of Mewlana was held in Kabul and in Balkh, the Mewlana's place of birth.\n\nOn 30 September 2007, Iranian school bells were rung throughout the country in honour of Mewlana. Also in that year, Iran held a Rumi Week from 26 October to 2 November. An international ceremony and conference were held in Tehran; the event was opened by the Iranian president and the chairman of the Iranian parliament. Scholars from twenty-nine countries attended the events, and 450 articles were presented at the conference. Iranian musician Shahram Nazeri was awarded the Légion d'honneur and Iran's House of Music Award in 2007 for his renowned works on Rumi masterpieces. 2007 was declared as the \"International Rumi Year\" by UNESCO.\n\nAlso on 30 September 2007, Turkey celebrated Rumi’s eight-hundredth birthday with a giant Whirling Dervish ritual performance of the \"samāʿ\", which was televised using forty-eight cameras and broadcast live in eight countries. Ertugrul Gunay, of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, stated, \"Three hundred dervishes are scheduled to take part in this ritual, making it the largest performance of sema in history.\"\n\nThe \"Mawlana Rumi Review\" () is published annually by The Centre for Persian and Iranian Studies at the University of Exeter in collaboration with The Rumi Institute, Nicosia, Cyprus, and Archetype Books, Cambridge. The first volume was published in 2010, and it has come out annually since then. According to the principal editor of the journal, Leonard Lewisohn: \"Although a number of major Islamic poets easily rival the likes of Dante, Shakespeare and Milton in importance and output, they still enjoy only a marginal literary fame in the West because the works of Arabic and Persian thinkers, writers and poets are considered as negligible, frivolous, tawdry sideshows beside the grand narrative of the Western Canon. It is the aim of the Mawlana Rumi Review to redress this carelessly inattentive approach to world literature, which is something far more serious than a minor faux pas committed by the Western literary imagination.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The hand thus used by secretaries was developed from cursive business hands and was in common use throughout the British Isles through the seventeenth century. In spite of its loops and flourishes it was widely used by scriveners and others whose daily employment comprised hours of writing. By 1618 the writing-master Martin Billingsley distinguished three forms of secretary hand, as well as \"mixed\" hands that employed some Roman letterforms, and the specialised hands, the \"court hand\" used only in the courts of the King's Bench and Common Pleas and the archaic hands used for engrossing pipe rolls and other documents. \n\nAt the time of Henry VII, many writers began to use the \"Italian\" style instead, a cursive script developed from the humanist minuscule or \"Roman\" hand which was easier to read but also easier to forge. English ladies were often taught an \"Italian hand\", suitable for the occasional writing that they were expected to do. Grace Ioppolo notes that the convention in writing the texts of dramas was to write act and scene settings, characters' names and stage directions in italic, and the dialogue in secretary hand. The modern use of italic font stems from these distinctions.\n\nAside from palaeographers themselves, genealogists, social historians and scholars of Early Modern literature have become accustomed to reading secretary hand.\n\nWilliam Henry Ireland used the secretary hand to forge many Shakespeare documents.\n\nTwo brief pamphlets provide introductory orientation: Lionel M. Munby, \"Secretary Hand: a beginner's introduction\" (British Association for Local History), 1984, and Alf Ison, \"A Secretary Hand ABC Book\", 1990.\n\n"}

They are the most important sources for the history of Nepal. A vast majority of the inscriptions found in Nepal are from the Kathmandu Valley where they are an ubiquitous element at heritage sites. They consist of royal edicts and dedicatory notes on Hindu and Buddhist temples, stupas, statues, water spouts and other architectural structures.\n\nThe early inscriptions are from the Licchavi period, and date from the fifth to the ninth centuries. They number more than 170, and are carved in Sanskrit language and Gupta script. Inscriptions from the 14th century onwards, which are the most numerous, are in Nepal language (Nepal Bhasa) and Nepal script. The earliest dated inscription in Nepal Bhasa is dated Nepal Era 293 (1173 AD).\n\nThe oldest dated inscription in Kathmandu dates from the year 107 of the Saka era which corresponds to 184/185 AD. This date was accepted by all historians except Dinesh Chandra Regmi who assigned it to the Gupta era (started on A.D. 320). Paleographically he says it to be close to Samudra Gupta's Allahabad inscription (A.D. 360). The inscription is carved in Gupta characters, also known as Brahmi script, on the pedestal of a statue of King Jayavarman. It was unearthed at a building site in Maligaon in 1992. The language is Sanskrit.\n\nPrior to this discovery, the distinction of the oldest dated stone inscription in the valley was held by an inscription carved on a pillar installed next to the Changu Narayan Temple in Bhaktapur which is dedicated to a Hindu deity Vishnu. It was inscribed in the year 383 which corresponds to 464 AD. It is written in the Sanskrit language and Gupta characters.\n\nAmong the thousands of Nepal language inscriptions scattered across Nepal Mandala, or the Kathmandu Valley and its neighborhood, there are a few inscribed in other languages too. King Pratap Malla's polyglot inscription dated Nepal Era 774 (1654 AD) at Kathmandu Durbar Square is an example of his linguistic interest. The massive stone with spouts to dispense water to travelers is carved in 15 languages including English, French and Persian.\n\nThree inscriptions written in Nepali (Khas Kura, Gorkhali) have been found in the Kathmandu Valley, all of them from the period in which Pratap Malla featured prominently in the politics of Kantipur. There is one at Makhan dated 1641 AD. Although it acknowledges Jaya Laxmi Malla, Pratap Malla's father, its date is very close to the formal commencement of Pratap Malla's ascension to the throne. Another at Guheswari bears the name Pratap Malla. Another famed stone inscription of Pratap Malla installed at Rani Pokhari pond contains writings in three languages: Sanskrit, Nepali and Nepal Bhasa. It is dated Nepal Era 790 (1670 AD) and describes the construction of Rani Pokhari and its religious significance.\n\nA large stone inscription containing texts in Nepal Bhasa and Tibetan is installed at the Swayambhu stupa complex. It records the renovation of the stupa during the years 1751-1758. The epitaph on the tombstone of a Capuchin missionary named Francesco della Penna, who died and was buried in Patan in 1745, contains texts in Latin and Nepal Bhasa.\n"}

The three South African provinces with the most speakers are Gauteng (circa 11%) and Northern Cape \nand North West (over 70%). Until 1994, South African Tswana people were notionally citizens of Bophuthatswana, one of the bantustans of the apartheid regime. The Setswana language in the Northwest Province has variations in which it is spoken according to the tribes found in the Tswana culture [Bakgatla, Barolong, Bakwena, Batlhaping, Bahurutshe, Bafokeng to name a few] the written language remains the same. Although Tswana is spoken mostly in South Africa and Botswana, a small number of speakers are also found in Zimbabwe and Namibia; respectively, an unknown number of people and about 10,000 people speak the language there. \n\nThe first European to describe the Tswana language was the German traveller H. Lichtenstein, who lived among the Tswana people Batlhaping in 1806, although his work was not published until 1930. He mistakenly regarded Tswana as a dialect of the Xhosa language, and the name he used for the language \"Beetjuana\" may also have covered the Northern and Southern Sotho languages.\nThe first major work on the Tswana language was carried out by the British missionary Robert Moffat, who had also lived among the Batlhaping, and published \"Bechuana Spelling Book\" and \"A Bechuana Catechism\" in 1826. In the following years he published several other books of the Bible and in 1857 he was able to publish a complete translation of the Bible.\n\nThe first grammar of the Tswana language was published in 1833 by the missionary James Archbell, although it was modelled on a Xhosa grammar. The first grammar of Tswana which regarded it as a separate language from Xhosa (but still not as a separate language from the Northern- and Southern Sotho languages) was published by the French missionary E. Casalis in 1841. He changed his mind later, and in a publication from 1882 he noted that the Northern and Southern Sotho languages were distinct from Tswana.\n\nSolomon Plaatje, a South African intellectual and linguist, was one of the first writers to extensively write in and about the Tswana language.\n\nThe vowel inventory of Tswana can be seen below.\n\nSome dialects have two additional vowels, the close-mid vowels and .\n\nThe consonant inventory of Tswana can be seen below.\n\nThe consonant is merely an allophone of , when the latter is followed by the vowels or . Two more sounds, v and \nz , exist only in loanwords.\n\nTswana also has three click consonants, but these are only used in interjections or ideophones, and tend only to be used by the older generation, and are therefore falling out of use. The three click consonants are the dental click , orthographically ; the lateral click , orthographically ; and the palatal click , orthographically .\n\nThere are some minor dialectal variations among the consonants between speakers of Tswana. For instance, is realised as either or by many speakers; is realised as in most dialects; and and are realised as and in northern dialects.\n\nStress is fixed in Tswana and thus always falls on the penult of a word, although some compounds may receive a secondary stress in the first part of the word. The syllable on which the stress falls is lengthened. Thus, mosadi is realised as .\n\nTswana has two tones, high and low, although the latter has a much wider distribution in words than the former. Tones are not marked orthographically which may lead to ambiguity.\n\nAn important feature of the tones is the so-called spreading of the high tone. If a syllable bears a high tone, the following two syllables will also get high tones, unless they are at the end of the word.\n\nNouns in Tswana are grouped into nine noun classes and one subclass, each having different prefixes. The nine classes and their respective prefixes can be seen below, along with a short note regarding the common characteristics of most nouns within their respective classes.\n\nSome nouns may be found in several classes. For instance, many class 1 nouns are also found in class 1a, class 3, class 4, and class 5.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "89243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89243", "title": "Upskirt", "text": "Upskirt\n\nUpskirting is the practice of making unauthorized photographs under a woman's skirt or man's kilt, capturing an image of the crotch area, underwear and sometimes genitalia. An upskirt is a photograph, video, or illustration which incorporates an image made by upskirting.\n\nThe practice is regarded as a form of sexual fetishism or voyeurism and is similar in nature to downblouse photography. The ethical and legal issue relating to upskirt and downblouse photography is one of a reasonable expectation of privacy, even in a public place.\n\nThe term \"upskirt\" is relatively recent, but the concept and interest therein are not. Looking up a woman's skirt was depicted in the 1767 painting \"The Swing\" by Jean-Honoré Fragonard. In \"polite society\", looking up a lady's skirt was regarded as impolite or rude. In less polite society, looking up a lady's skirt or her lifting up the skirt or otherwise exposing her underwear was regarded as bawdy, as in the case of cabaret dances such as the can-can or in the case of entertainment involving the raising of a dancer's dress by her spinning rapidly. By the polite society, such behaviour was widely judged as indecent.\n\nThe sudden popularity in the 1960s of the miniskirt brought the concept out onto the streets, and was viewed by many as mass exhibitionism. One commentator in the 1960s said, \"In European countries ... they ban mini-skirts in the streets and say they're an invitation to rape...\" By contrast, many women viewed the new style as rebellion against previous clothing styles and as women's liberation of their own bodies. For the first time, many women felt comfortable exposing their thighs, whether on the beach in a swimsuit or in street wear, and were even relaxed when in some situations their underwear would be visible.\n\nSome upskirt and downblouse images originate as innocent fun images which are made with the knowledge and lack of objection of the females affected. However, some of these images can finish up being more widely distributed or being posted onto the Internet without the knowledge and consent of the subject, for example as revenge porn following a relationship breakup.\n\nSome upskirt and downblouse photos and videos are made specifically to upload onto the Internet, where many viewers seek such images taken surreptitiously (and presumably without the subject's consent). Such photographs are common on fetish and pornographic websites, as well as on video sharing sites such as YouTube.\n\nAttitudes hardened with the very widespread availability and use of digital photographic and video technology, most recently camera phones. Such technology was also being used to record upskirt and downblouse images for uploading onto the internet. Specialist websites came into existence where people could share such images, and terms such as \"upskirt\", \"downblouse\" and \"nipple dress\" (i.e., when an erect nipple is evident through the material of a woman's dress) came into use. Of particular concern were images of minors and of people who could be identified. Celebrities were popular victims of such efforts. Issues of privacy and reputation began to be raised.\n\nThe creation and viewing of this type of image came increasingly to be described as forms of voyeurism and pornography. This was not that most of such images were sexual in nature, with most of them being quite innocent by themselves, but because of their association with the nature of the website on which they were posted and because of the size of the collections.\n\nUpskirt photos can be made in a variety of situations, such as when a woman is ascending stairs or getting out of a car or just sitting on a park bench; and downblouse photos can similarly be made in many innocent situations. Upskirt photos are usually taken by a concealed camera attached on the shoe or carried within a bag so it is very hard for a woman to notice that she is being photographed in this manner. There are many methods and types of making upskirt photos and it is very rare for a woman to notice it before actually seeing herself on some of the voyeur websites that display such photographs.\n\nMany countries do not have laws which protect a person's right to personal privacy, especially in a public place, but the legal position does vary considerably.\n\nAll jurisdictions within Australia have passed laws making it illegal to take upskirt photos in public places without the person's consent.\n\nIn 2010, an elderly man had his camera confiscated and was fined 12 day-fines for the act of \"public obscenity\" (which was thought to be the closest match in the criminal code), having taken dozens of upskirt photos in a shopping centre in Turku.\n\nIn India, under section 66E, of the Information Technology Act, \"Whoever, intentionally or knowingly captures, publishes or transmits the image of a private area of any person without his or her consent, under circumstances violating the privacy of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years or with fine not exceeding two lakh (200,000) rupees, or with both\". The words \"private area\" mean the naked or undergarment-clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breast. \"under circumstances violating privacy\" means circumstances in which a person can have a reasonable expectation that any part of his or her private area would not be visible to the public, regardless of whether that person is in a public or private place.\n\nIn Japan, some prefectures have laws against upskirt photography. Camera phones sold in Japan generally make an audible noise when taking a picture, making the person more likely to notice if clandestine upskirt photos are being taken without consent. However, there are also apps that circumvent this by making the camera silent.\n\nIn New Zealand it is illegal to make a visual recording of a person's intimate parts in any setting in which the person has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". This includes public and private settings. It is also illegal to possess or distribute such images.\n\nEngland and Wales have no specific ban against upskirting. When upskirting takes place in public, it is outside of the scope of the offence of voyeurism under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Nevertheless, prosecutions for upskirting have been successful under the common law offence of outraging public decency.\n\nIn August 2017, Gina Martin, who was upskirted at a music festival, began a campaign to reopen her case after the police closed it; Martin's case ignited a public debate over the legality of upskirting in England and Wales. The Labour Party backed her petition, which attracted over 58,000 signatures, to make the practice of upskirting illegal under the Sexual Offences Act. Following a freedom of information request created from Martin's campaign, it was revealed that between 2015 and 2017, there were 11 charges related to upskirting in England and Wales, but that only 15 out of 44 police forces held specific records for it.\n\nThe campaign to make upskirting a specific crime in England and Wales has been supported by Conservative MP Maria Miller, Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, the End Violence Against Women Coalition, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, the television presenter Laura Whitmore and Clare McGlynn, a professor at Durham University specialising in image-based sexual abuse.\n\nOn 6 March 2018, Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse presented a Private Members' Bill to the House of Commons in support of Martin's national campaign, which proposed amending the Sexual Offences Act 2003; the bill would outlaw acts of voyeurism, including upskirting. The maximum sentence for the offence would be two years’ imprisonment and in the most serious cases those convicted would be added to the Violent and Sex Offender Register. Justice Secretary David Gauke signalled that the government would support Hobhouse's bill, which was later supported by the Prime Minister, Theresa May. The bill was not debated at its presentation.\n\nAt its second reading in the Commons on 15 June 2018, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to Hobhouse's bill, delaying its passage through the Commons. Chope said that his reason for blocking the bill's passage was in objection to parliamentary procedure rather than to the bill itself: he stated that he would \"wholeheartedly\" support a government bill that outlawed upskirting. Chope's actions drew immediate criticism from fellow MPs, including some in his own party. May also expressed her disappointment at the objection. In protest at his actions, staff at the House of Commons placed a bunting of women's underwear outside Chope's office entrance. A similar bunting was also placed outside his constituency office. Protestors also confronted Chope at his constituency surgery.\n\nMcGlynn said that, by being returned to the House of Commons for debate, Hobhouse's bill could now be amended and \"future-proofed\" to include penalties for creators of deepfake pornographic images. McGlynn said that the bill as drafted had \"placed too high a burden of proof on prosecutors because they had to show that a picture was taken for the purposes of sexual gratification or to cause distress\" when \"the unfortunate reality is that these things are often done 'for a laugh'. It's not clear to me that the current proposed legislation will cover these situations.\"\n\nFollowing Chope's objection, the government reaffirmed its commitment to introduce legislation to outlaw upskirting. A government bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 21 June 2018. Speaking on the government's behalf in the House of Lords, Baroness Vere of Norbiton said that the legislation would also protect men wearing kilts. The bill passed its second reading on 3 July 2018.\n\nUpskirting is a specific offence in Scotland under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act. This Act, which was passed by the Scottish Parliament, extended the definition of voyeurism to cover upskirting.\n\nIn the United States, laws vary by state. At the federal level the United States enacted the \"Video Voyeurism Prevention Act\" of 2004 to punish those who intentionally make an image of an individual's private areas without consent, when the person knew the subject had an expectation of privacy.\n\nAdditionally, many state laws address the issue as well.\n\nA 2005 Illinois law made it a crime to videotape or transmit upskirt videos of other people without their consent. A 2014 Chicago ordinance made the crime punishable by a $500 fine.\n\nIn March 2014, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overruled a lower court upskirt ruling because the women photographed were not nude or partially nude, saying that existing so-called Peeping Tom laws protect people from being photographed in dressing rooms and bathrooms when nude or partially nude, but it does not protect clothed people in public areas. A law was then passed in Massachusetts to ban the practice.\n\nIn September 2014 the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals voided the state's statute against \"improper photography or visual recording\" including \"upskirt\" photos, saying its wording was overly broad. The court's opinion stated: “Protecting someone who appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be the sort of ‘paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant’s mind’ that the First Amendment was designed to guard against.”\n\nIn 2017, actress Natalie Morales criticized paparazzi for intentionally taking her upskirt photos and passing them off as her wardrobe malfunction.\n\n\n"}
