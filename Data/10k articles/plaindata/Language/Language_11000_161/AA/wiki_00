It was created as a hobby in 1996 by Andrew Smith from New Zealand, who also invented the alternate history of Ill Bethisad to \"explain\" it.\n\nBrithenig was not developed to be used in the real world, like Esperanto or Interlingua, nor to provide detail to a work of fiction, like Klingon from the \"Star Trek\" scenarios. Rather, Brithenig started as a thought experiment to create a Romance language that might have evolved if Latin had displaced the native Celtic language as the spoken language of the people in Great Britain.\n\nThe result is an artificial sister language to French, Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Occitan and Italian which differs from them by having sound-changes similar to those that affected the Welsh language, and words that are borrowed from the Brittonic languages and from English throughout its pseudo-history. One important distinction between Brithenig and Welsh is that while Welsh is P-Celtic, Latin was a Q-Italic language (as opposed to P-Italic, like Oscan), and this trait was passed onto Brithenig.\n\nSimilar efforts to extrapolate Romance languages are \"Breathanach\" (influenced by the other branch of Celtic), \"Judajca\" (influenced by Hebrew), \"Þrjótrunn\" (a non-Ill Bethisad language influenced by Icelandic), \"Wenedyk\" (influenced by Polish), and \"Xliponian\" (which experienced a Grimm's law-like sound shift). It has also inspired \"Wessisc\", a hypothetical Germanic language influenced by contact with Old Celtic.\n\nBrithenig was granted the code BZT as part of .\n\nAndrew Smith was one of the conlangers featured in the exhibit \"Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages\" displayed at the Cleveland Public Library from May through August 2008. Smith's creation of Brithenig was cited as the reason for his inclusion in the exhibit (which also included the Babel Text in Smith's language).\n\nMost of Brithenig's vocabulary is distinctively Romance, even though it is disguised as Welsh. The following list of 30 words gives an impression of what Brithenig looks like in comparison to nine other Romance languages including Wenedyk, and to Welsh. The similarity of about one-quarter of the Welsh words to Brithenig words (indicated by not being bracketed) is due to their common Indo-European background, although a few others, such as \"ysgol\", were borrowings from Latin into Welsh.\n\nThe Lord's Prayer:\n\n\n"}

The tactic became largely obsolete with the introduction of missiles and aircraft as long-range strikes are less dependent on the direction the ships are facing.\n\nWhen going into battle, ships would assume a battle line formation called \"line astern\", in which one vessel follows another in one or more parallel lines. This allows each ship to fire over wide arcs without lofting salvos of projectiles over friendly vessels. Each ship in the line generally engages its opposite number in the enemy battle line which moves in a parallel course.\n\nHowever, moving ahead of the enemy line on a perpendicular course (crossing the \"T\") enables a ship to launch salvos at the same target with both the forward and rear turrets, maximizing the chances for a hit. It also makes ranging errors less critical for the ship doing the crossing, while simultaneously more critical for the ship being crossed. In military terms, this is known as \"enfilade fire\". The tactic, designed for heavily armed and armoured battleships, was used with varying degrees of success with more lightly armed and armoured cruisers and heavy cruisers.\n\nAdvances in gun manufacturing and fire-control systems allowed engagements at increasingly long range, from approximately 6,000 yards (5.5 km; 2.9 nautical miles) at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 to 20,000 yards (18 km; 9.8 nautical miles) at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. The introduction of brown powder, which burned less rapidly than black powder, allowed longer barrels, which allow greater accuracy; and because it expands less sharply than black powder, it puts less strain on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances. The addition of radar allowed World War II-era ships to fire farther, more accurately, and at night.\n\nNotable battles in which warships crossed the \"T\" include:\n\n\n\n"}

He worked to develop Nepal Bhasa and revive Theravada Buddhism when Nepal was ruled by the Rana dynasty and both were dangerous activities, and was consequently jailed.\n\nDharmacharya campaigned for Nepal Era as the national calendar. He also wrote and published the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa and was a major influence in the Nepal Bhasa renaissance. Because of his service to the language, he has also been called the \"fifth pillar\" of Nepal Bhasa along with the Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa.\n\nDharmacharya was born at Chikan Bahi, Lalitpur District to father Vaidya Vrishman Vandya and mother Muni Thakun Vandya. He studied at Durbar High School in Kathmandu and did his matriculation from Kolkata and enrolled at the University of Calcutta for higher studies.\n\nOn his visits to Kathmandu during the holidays, he organized Buddhist programs and exhibitions of religious pictures he had collected in Kolkata. In 1924, he established the Buddha Dharma Support Association at the home of Dharma Man Tuladhar. He encouraged its members to read Buddhist books and translated articles in English and Pali into Nepal Bhasa.\n\nUpon his return to Kolkata, he established the Nepalese Buddhist Association to help Nepalese traders who had fallen into difficulty besides teaching them Buddhist principles. In 1928, he helped organize the All India Buddhist Conference.\n\nIn an effort to promote Buddhism among the Nepalese in Darjeeling, he brought out \"Himalaya Bauddha\" in the Nepali language and \"Buddhist India\" in English in 1927 which he and B. M. Barua (Benimadhab Barua) edited.\n\nDharmacharya was a cultural nationalist and dedicated himself to promoting Nepal Bhasa and obtaining international recognition for it.\n\nIn 1925, he published \"Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa\" (बुद्ध धर्म व नॆपाल भाषा \"Buddhism and Nepalese\") from Kolkata, India. It was the first ever magazine to be published in Nepal Bhasa. It contained articles on Buddhism and also provided writers in Nepal a place to publish their compositions which they couldn't do at home because of the government's dislike of the language.\n\nIn order to support the emerging Nepal Bhasa movement in Nepal and promote the language at home and abroad, he established the first Nepal Bhasa literary organization Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Mandal (\"Nepal Bhasa Literature Organization\") in Kolkata in 1926.\n\nDharmacharya returned to Kathmandu with a Master's degree in Pali. He joined the Industry Council as an administrative officer and got married to Asta Maya and settled down into the life of a householder.\n\nIn 1940, Dharmacharya was arrested in a crackdown against democracy activists, writers and social reformers. He was jailed for three months with other Nepal Bhasa writers. Following the incident, he remained inactive in social work for more than five years. He spent the later part of his life lecturing and writing.\n\nIn 1956, Dharmacharya was decorated with the title of Patron of the Language by Chwasa Pasa. A statue of Dharmacharya has been erected at Pulchok, Lalipur.\n"}

Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedia and, , has the most articles of any of the editions. As of 2018, of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-language edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003, due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages. As of 03 2018, there are articles on the site. In October 2015, the combined text of the English Wikipedia's articles totalled 11.5 gigabytes when compressed. On 1 November 2015, the English Wikipedia announced it had reached 5,000,000 articles and ran a special logo to reflect the milestone.\n\nThe Simple English Wikipedia is a variation in which most of the articles use only basic English vocabulary. There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon) Wikipedia (). Community-produced news publications include \"The Signpost\".\n\nThe English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the largest. It has pioneered many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include \"featured articles\",\nthe neutral-point-of-view policy, navigation templates,\nthe sorting of short \"stub\" articles into sub-categories, dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,\nand weekly collaborations.\n\nThe English Wikipedia has adopted features from Wikipedias in other languages. These features include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia () and town population-lookup templates from the Dutch Wikipedia ().\n\nAlthough the English Wikipedia stores images and audio files, as well as text files, many of the images have been moved to Wikimedia Commons with the same name, as passed-through files. However, the English Wikipedia also has fair-use images and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions), most of which are not allowed on Commons.\n\nMany of the most active participants in the Wikimedia Foundation, and the developers of the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, are English users.\n\nThe English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007, just a little over a year since it had crossed a threshold of 1,000,000 registered user accounts in late February 2006.\n\nOver 800,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times. 300,000 editors edit Wikipedia every month; of these, over 30,000 perform more than 5 edits per month, and a little over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month. By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been performed on the English Wikipedia.\n\nAs the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used language, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose native language is not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations have been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add content to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors for them.\n\nThe English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia. The committee was created by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site.\n\nWhen initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each. Since then, the committee has gradually expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.\n\nAs with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister projects have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions. For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the German Wikipedia called the .\n\nSeveral incidents of threats of violence against high schools on Wikipedia have been reported in the mainstream press. The Glen A. Wilson High School was the subject of such a threat in 2008, and a 14-year-old was arrested for making a threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia in 2006.\n\nA 2013 study from Oxford University concluded that the most disputed articles on the English Wikipedia tended to be broader issues, while on other language Wikipedias the most disputed articles tended to be regional issues; this is due to the English language's status as a global \"lingua franca\", which means that many who edit the English Wikipedia do not speak English as a native language. The study stated that the most disputed entries on the English Wikipedia were: George W. Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE personnel, global warming, circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and intelligence, and Christianity.\n\nOne controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which national variety of the English language is to be preferred, with the most commonly advocated candidates being American English and British English. Perennial suggestions range from standardizing upon a single form of English to forking the English Wikipedia project. A style guideline states, \"the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language\" and \"an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation\". An article should use spelling and grammar variants consistently; for example, \"color\" and \"colour\" are not to be used in the same article, since they represent American and British English, respectively. The guide also states that an article must remain in its original national variant.\n\nThere has been a similar issue in the Chinese-language Wikipedia concerning regional differences in writing. Efforts toward a language fork for Portuguese Wikipedia have failed, but those regarding Norwegian Wikipedia succeeded.\n\nAndrew Lih wrote that the English Wikipedia \"didn't have the chance to go through a debate over whether there should be a British English Wikipedia or an American English Wikipedia\" because the English Wikipedia was the original edition. Editors agreed to use U.S. spellings for primarily American topics and British spellings for primarily British topics. In 2009 Lih wrote, \"No doubt, American spellings tend to dominate by default just because of sheer numbers.\"\n\nA \"WikiProject\" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for example, women's history), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over and activity varies.\n\nIn 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles. Articles are rated by WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with \"Stub\" (very short pages), followed by \"Start\", \"C\" and \"B\" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes: either \"\", \"A\" or the highest, \"\". Of the about 4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5,000 (0.12%) are featured articles, and fewer than 2,000 (0.04%) are featured lists. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main page of Wikipedia.\n\nThe articles can also be rated as per \"importance\" as judged by a WikiProject. Currently, there are 5 importance categories: \"low\", \"mid\", \"high\", \"top\", and \"???\" for unclassified/uncertain level. For a particular article, different WikiProjects may assign different importance levels.\n\nThe has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English Wikipedia. \"If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiProjects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart\". The software regularly auto-updates the data.\n\nResearcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors. A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.\n\nAutomatic quality assessment of Wikipedia articles is a known and wide scientific problem. For example, as measures for assessing quality, it can be taken into the account number of the references, text length, number of images, sections, articles popularity and others.\n\nCommunity-produced news publications include . \"The Signpost\" (previously known as \"The Wikipedia Signpost\") is the English Wikipedia's newspaper. It is managed by the Wikipedia community and is published online weekly. Each edition contains stories and articles related to the Wikipedia community. A wide range of editors contribute articles and other pieces.\n\nThe publication was founded in January 2005 by Wikipedia administrator and later Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, Michael Snow. Originally titled \"The Wikipedia Signpost\", it was later shortened to simply \"The Signpost\". The newspaper reports on Wikipedia events including Arbitration Committee rulings, Wikimedia Foundation issues, and other Wikipedia-related projects. Snow continued to contribute as a writer to \"The Signpost\" until his appointment to the of the Wikimedia Foundation in February 2008.\n\nInvestigative journalism by \"The Signpost\" in 2015 on changes to freedom of panorama copyright restrictions in Europe was covered by publications in multiple languages including German, Italian, Polish, and Russian. Wikipedia users Gamaliel and Go Phightins! became editors-in-chief of \"The Signpost\" in January 2015; prior editor-in-chief The ed17 noted that during his tenure the publication expanded its scope by including more reporting on the wider Wikimedia movement and English Wikipedia itself. In a letter to readers upon the newspaper's tenth anniversary, the new co-editors-in-chief stressed the importance of maintaining independence from the Wikimedia Foundation in their reporting.\n\n\"The Signpost\" has been the subject of academic analysis in publications including \"Sociological Forum\", the social movements journal \"Interface\", and \"New Review of Academic Librarianship\"; and was consulted for data on Wikipedia by researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Dartmouth College. It has garnered generally positive reception from media publications including \"The New York Times\", \"The Register\", \"Nonprofit Quarterly\", and \"Heise Online\". The book \"\" called \"The Signpost\" essential reading for ambitious new Wikipedia editors.\n\nOther past and present community news publications include the \"WikiWorld\" web comic, the podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like from and the monthly newsletter from . There are also a number of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the and \"\".\n\n\n\n"}

FPDA is based on a combination of feminism and post-structuralism. While it is still evolving as a methodology, FPDA has been used by a range of international scholars of gender and language to analyse texts such as: classroom discourse (Castañeda-Peña 2008; Sauntson 2012), teenage girls' conversation (Kamada 2008; 2010), and media representations of gender (Baker 2013). FPDA is an approach to analysing the discourse of spoken interaction principally.\n\nThe poststructualist part of FPDA views language as social practice and considers that people's identities and relationships are 'performed' through spoken interaction. FPDA analyses the ways in which speakers are 'positioned' by different and often competing 'discourses' according to Michel Foucault's (1972: 49) definition as 'practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak'. According to this, speakers constantly move between powerful and powerless 'subject positions' as they talk and interact. FPDA is influenced by a poststructuralist rather than a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) perspective: that is, the method is informed by the view that no speaker is wholly a victim and powerless, nor wholly dominant and powerful. Rather, speakers are constantly shifting their subject positions according to the interplay of discourses within specific settings. The feminist part of FPDA considers gender difference to be a dominant discourse among competing discourses when analysing all types of text. According to Baxter (2003), FPDA does not have an 'emancipatory' agenda for women but a 'transformative' one. This means that it aims to represent women's voices that have been 'silenced' or marginalised since FPDA considers that these have been historically absent in many cultures. For example, Kamada (2008a; 2008b and 2010) uses FPDA to show how a friendship group of half-Japanese girls, who are seen by their culture as 'less than whole', draw upon competing discourses to negotiate more positive versions of their 'hybrid' ethnic and gender identities.\n\nThe above definition of FPDA developed from the ideas of the formalist, Mikhail Bakhtin (1981)] and the poststructuralist thinkers Jacques Derrida (1987)] and Michel Foucault (1972) in relation to power, knowledge and discourses. It is also based on the feminist work of Victorial Bergvall (1998)], Judith Butler (1990) Bronwyn Davies (1997), Valerie Walkerdine (1990)] and especially Chris Weedon (1997). Adopters of FPDA include Judith Baxter in the analysis of classroom talk and business meeting interactions; Laurel Kamada (2008; 2008; 2010) in the analysis of 'hybrid' identities of half-Japanese girls, Harold Castañeda-Peña (2008) in the examination of pupils in an EFL classroom in Brazil; Helen Sauntson in the analysis of UK secondary school classroom talk; and Paul Baker(2013) in the study of newspaper representations of predatory women. FPDA is based on the following principles, which continue to be discussed and debated by scholars:\n\n\n\n"}

For example, on a closed curve formula_1 of length , for each point of the curve there is a unique other point of the curve (called the antipodal of ) at distance from .\n\nA compact surface fills a closed curve if its border (also called boundary, denoted ) is the curve . The filling is said isometric if for any two points of the boundary curve , the distance between them along is the same (not less) than the distance along the boundary. In other words, to fill a curve isometrically is to fill it without introducing shortcuts.\n\nQuestion: \"How small can be the area of a surface that isometrically fills its boundary curve, of given length?\"\n\nFor example, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, the circle\n\n(of length 2) is filled by the flat disk\n\nwhich is not an isometric filling, because any straight chord along it is a shortcut. In contrast, the hemisphere\n\nis an isometric filling of the same circle , which has twice the area of the flat disk. Is this the minimum possible area?\n\nThe surface can be imagined as made of a flexible but non-stretchable material, that allows it to be moved around and bended in Euclidean space. None of these transformations modifies the area of the surface nor the length of the curves drawn on it, which are the magnitudes relevant to the problem. The surface can be removed from Euclidean space altogether, obtaining a Riemannian surface, which is an abstract smooth surface with a Riemannian metric that encodes the lengths and area. Reciprocally, according to the Nash-Kuiper theorem, any Riemannian surface with boundary can be embedded in Euclidean space preserving the lengths and area specified by the Riemannian metric. Thus the filling problem can be stated equivalently as a question about Riemannian surfaces, that are not placed in Euclidean space in any particular way.\n\nIn the same paper where Gromov stated the conjecture, he proved that\n\nProof: Let formula_5 be a Riemannian disk that isometrically fills its boundary of length formula_6. Glue each point formula_7 with its antipodal point formula_8, defined as the unique point of formula_9 that is at the maximum possible distance formula_10 from formula_11. Gluing in this way we obtain a closed Riemannian surface formula_12 that is homeomorphic to the real projective plane and whose systole (the length of the shortest non-contractible curve) is equal to formula_10. (And reciprocally, if we cut open a projective plane along a shortest noncontractible loop of length formula_10, we obtain a disk that fills isometrically its boundary of length formula_6.) Thus the minimum area that the isometric filling formula_5 can have is equal to the minimum area that a Riemannian projective plane of systole formula_10 can have. But then Pu's systolic inequality asserts precisely that a Riemannian projective plane of given systole has minimum area if and only if it is round (that is, obtained from a Euclidean sphere by identifying each point with its opposite). The area of this round projective plane equals the area of the hemisphere (because each of them has half the area of the sphere).\n\nThe proof of Pu's inequality relies, in turn, on the uniformization theorem.\n\nIn 2001, Sergei Ivanov presented another way to prove that the hemisphere has smallest area among isometric fillings homeomorphic to a disk. His argument does not employ the uniformization theorem and is based instead on the topological fact that two curves on a disk must cross if their four endpoints are on the boundary and interlaced. Moreover, Ivanov's proof applies more generally to disks with Finsler metrics, which differ from Riemannian metrics in that they need not satisfy the Pythagorean equation at the infinitesimal level. The area of a Finsler surface can be defined in various inequivalent ways, and the one employed here is the Holmes–Thompson area, which coincides with the usual area when the metric is Riemannian. What Ivanov proved is that\n\nLet be a Finsler disk that isometrically fills its boundary of length . We may assume that is the standard round disk in , and the Finsler metric is smooth and strongly convex. The Holmes–Thompson area of the filling can be computed by the formula\n\nwhere for each point formula_19, the set formula_20 is the dual unit ball of the norm formula_21 (the unit ball of the dual norm formula_22), and formula_23 is its usual area as a subset of formula_24.\n\nChoose a collection formula_25 of boundary points, listed in counterclockwise order. For each point formula_26, we define on \"M\" the scalar function formula_27. These functions have the following properties:\n\nIn summary, for almost every interior point formula_31, the covectors formula_47 are vertices, listed in counterclockwise order, of a convex polygon inscribed in the dual unit ball formula_48. The area of this polygon is formula_49 (where the index \"i\" + 1 is computed modulo \"n\"). Therefore we have a lower bound\n\nfor the area of the filling. If we define the 1-form formula_51, then we can rewrite this lower bound using the Stokes formula as\n\nThe boundary integral that appears here is defined in terms of the distance functions formula_30 restricted to the boundary, which \"do not depend on the isometric filling\". The result of the integral therefore depends only on the placement of the points formula_26 on the circle of length \"2L\". We omitted the computation, and expressed the result in terms of the lengths formula_55 of each counterclockwise boundary arc from a point formula_26 to the following point formula_57. The computation is valid only if formula_58.\n\nIn summary, our lower bound for the area of the Finsler isometric filling converges to formula_59 as the collection formula_60 is densified. This implies that\n\nas we had to prove.\n\nUnlike the Riemannian case, there is a great variety of Finsler disks that isometrically fill a closed curve and have the same Holmes–Thompson area as the hemisphere. If the Hausdorff area is used instead, then the minimality of the hemisphere still holds, but the hemisphere becomes the unique minimizer. This follows from Ivanov's theorem since Normalization and comparison with Euclidean and Hausdorff measure|the Hausdorff area of a Finsler manifold is never less than the Holmes–Thompson area, and the two areas are equal if and only if the metric is Riemannian.\n\nA Euclidean disk that fills a circle can be replaced, without decreasing the distances between boundary points, by a Finsler disk that fills the same circle =10 times (in the sense that its boundary wraps around the circle times), but whose Holmes–Thompson area is less than times the area of the disk. For the hemisphere, a similar replacement can be found. In other words, the filling area conjecture is false if Finsler 2-chains with \"rational coefficients\" are allowed as fillings, instead of orientable surfaces (which are equivalent to 2-chains with \"integer coefficients\").\n\nAn orientable Riemannian surface of genus one that isometrically fills the circle cannot have less area than the hemisphere. The proof in this case again starts by gluing antipodal points of the boundary. The non-orientable closed surface obtained in this way has an orientable double cover of genus two, and is therefore hyperelliptic. The proof then exploits a formula by J. Hersch from integral geometry. Namely, consider the family of figure-8 loops on a football, with the self-intersection point at the equator. Hersch's formula expresses the area of a metric in the conformal class of the football, as an average of the energies of the figure-8 loops from the family. An application of Hersch's formula to the hyperelliptic quotient of the Riemann surface proves the filling area conjecture in this case.\n\nIf a Riemannian manifold (of any dimension) is almost flat (more precisely, is a region of formula_62 with a Riemannian metric that is formula_63-near the standard Euclidean metric), then is a volume minimizer: it cannot be replaced by an orientable Riemannian manifold that fills the same boundary and has less volume without reducing the distance between some boundary points. This implies that if a piece of sphere is sufficiently small (and therefore, nearly flat), then it is a volume minimizer. If this theorem can be extended to large regions (namely, to the whole hemisphere), then the filling area conjecture is true. It has been conjectured that all simple Riemannian manifolds (those that are convex at their boundary, and where every two points are joined by a unique geodesic) are volume minimizers.\n\nThe proof that each almost flat manifold is a volume minimizer involves embedding in formula_64, and then showing that any isometric replacement of can also be mapped into the same space formula_65, and projected onto , without increasing its volume. This implies that the replacement has not less volume than the original manifold .\n\n"}

It arises from a problem in the ‘functioning’ of the nervous system, and not due to a structural or pathologically defined disease. Functional symptoms are increasingly viewed within a framework in which psychological, physiological and biological factors should be considered to be relevant.\n\nHistorically, there has often been fierce debate about whether certain problems are predominantly related to an abnormality of structure (disease) or function (abnormal nervous system functioning), and what are at one stage posited to be functional symptoms are sometimes later reclassified as organic, as investigative techniques improve.\nThus, on finding itself unable to discover effective treatments or physiological causes for symptoms, the medical profession, in explaining to itself these limitations of its own power over nature, is of course subject to a temptation to minimize the explanatory role played by the many gaps in its own current scientific understanding, and instead to grope for theories of psychosomatic aetiology to account for the physical symptoms that it cannot otherwise explain, and cannot cure. (To caricature this reasoning: \"I can't cure you: you must be mad\".) It is well established that psychosomatic symptoms are a real phenomenon, so this potential explanation is often plausible, not always easily refutable, and can be reassuring (at least for the doctor). Sometimes it is correct. For example, symptoms associated with migraine, epilepsy, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, stomach ulcers, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease and many other conditions have all tended historically at first to be explained largely as physical manifestations of the sufferer's psychological state of mind; \"until\" such time as new physiological knowledge is eventually gained. At this point, a part of the earlier reliance on psychological explanations often evaporates. Taking a long, historical view, doctors being human, there seems little reason to suppose that this historical pattern of eventual correction of earlier psychological misattribution of symptoms is yet become a thing of the past. Another specific example is functional constipation, which may have psychological or psychiatric causes. However, one type of apparently functional constipation, anismus, may have a neurological (physical) basis.\n\nWhilst misdiagnosis of functional symptoms does occur, in neurology, for example, this appears to occur no more frequently than of other neurological or psychiatric syndromes. However, in order to be quantified, misdiagnosis has to be recognized as such, which can be problematic in such a challenging field as medicine.\n\nA common trend is to see functional symptoms and syndromes such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and functional neurological symptoms such as functional weakness as symptoms in which both biological and psychological factors are relevant, without one necessarily being dominant.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2536383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2536383", "title": "Isaac of Nineveh", "text": "Isaac of Nineveh\n\nIsaac of Nineveh (; Arabic: إسحاق النينوي \"Ishaq an-Naynuwī\"; ; c. 613 – c. 700) also remembered as Saint Isaac the Syrian, Abba Isaac, Isaac Syrus and Isaac of Qatar was a 7th-century Church of the East Syriac Christian bishop and theologian best remembered for his written works on Christian asceticism. He is regarded as a saint in the (non-Ephesine) Assyrian Church of the East. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, his feast day falls, together with 4th-century theologian and hymnographer St. Ephrem the Syrian, on January 28.\n\nHe was born in the region of Beth Qatraye in Eastern Arabia, a mixed Syriac and Arabic speaking region encompassing the south east of Mesopotamia and the north eastern Arabian peninsula. When still quite young, he entered a monastery where he devoted his energies towards the practice of asceticism. After many years of studying at the library attached to the monastery, he emerged as an authoritative figure in theology. Shortly after, he dedicated his life to monasticism and became involved in religious education throughout the Beth Qatraye region. When the Catholicos Georges (680–659) visited Beth Qatraye in the middle of the seventh century to attend a synod, he ordained Isaac bishop of Nineveh far to the north in Assyria.\n\nThe administrative duties did not suit his retiring and ascetic bent: he requested to abdicate after only five months, and went south to the wilderness of Mount Matout, a refuge for anchorites. There he lived in solitude for many years, eating only three loaves a week with some uncooked vegetables, a detail that never failed to astonish his hagiographers. Eventually blindness and old age forced him to retire to the Assyrian monastery of Shabar in Mesopotamia, where he died and was buried. At the time of his death he was nearly blind, a fact that some attribute to his devotion to study.\n\nIsaac is remembered for his spiritual homilies on the inner life, which have a human breadth and theological depth that transcends the Christianity of the Church to which he belonged. They survive in Syriac manuscripts and in later Greek, Arabic, and Georgian translations. From Greek they were translated into Russian.\n\nIsaac consciously avoided writing on topics that were disputed or discussed in the contemporary theological debates. This gives Isaac a certain ecumenical potential, and is probably the reason that he has come to be venerated and appreciated among many different Christian traditions.\n\nIsaac stands in the tradition of the eastern mystical saints and placed a considerable emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHis melancholic style as well as his affinity towards the sick and dying exerted considerable influence on Eastern Orthodoxy. His writings were continuously studied by monastery circles outside his church during the 8th and 9th century. Moreover, Isaac's conviction that the notion of God punishing men endlessly through the mystery of Gehenna (the lake of fire, or hell) is not compatible with his all encompassing love can likely be seen as the central thematic conflict in his second treatise of mystical teachings.\n\nIsaac's writings offer a rare example of a large corpus of ascetical texts written by an experienced hermit and is thus an important writer when it comes to understanding early Christian asceticism.\n\nThe instructions of Isaac the Syrian came to us in several books. The First book contains 82 chapters while the Second contains 41. There is also a Third book which has been translated into Italian and English but has yet to be published in English. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\"To whatever extent a person draws close to God with his intentions, is to what extent God draws close to him with His gifts.\n\nA handful of sand, thrown into the sea, is what sinning is, when compared to God’s Providence and mercy. Just like an abundant source of water is not impeded by a handful of dust, so is the Creator’s mercy not defeated by the sins of His creations.\n\nThe natural that precedes faith is the path toward faith and toward God. Being implanted by God into our nature, it alone convinces us for the need to believe in God, Who had brought everything into being.\n\nThose, in whom the light of faith truly shines, never reach such unashamedness as to ask God: \"Give us this,\" or — \"Remove from us this.\" Because their spiritual eyes — with which they were blessed by that genuine Father, Who with His great love, countlessly transcends any fatherly love — continually view the Father’s Providence, they are not concerned in the slightest about themselves. God can do more than anyone else, and can assist us by a far greater measure than we could ever ask for, or even imagine.\"\n\nThe mouth which is continuously giving thanks receives blessing from God. In the heart that always shows gratitude, grace abides (Brock, 1997).\n\nThe aim of prayer is that we should acquire from it love of God, for in prayer are to be found all sorts of reason for loving God (Brock, 1997).\n\nDo not consider a long time spent in worship before God to be wasted (Brock, 1997)\n\nUndistracted prayer is prayer which produces the continual thought of God in the soul (Brock, 1997)\n\nAt the time of darkness, more than anything else kneeling is helpful (Brock, 1997).\n\nThe more a person enters the struggle for the sake of God, the closer will his heart come to freedom of converse in prayer (Brock, 1997).\n\n\n\"To select a good deed depends on the initiator; to realize the intention — that is God’s deed. Consequently, let us adhere to the rule, so that every good intention that comes to us is followed by frequent prayers, appealing to God to not only grant us help, but also if it is pleasing or not to Him. Because not every good intention comes from God, but only those that are beneficial.\n\nSometimes, a person wishes something good, but God doesn’t help him — maybe because the intention came from the devil and is not for our benefit; or maybe because it is beyond our strength as we have not attained the necessary spiritual level; or maybe because it doesn’t correspond to our calling; or maybe because the time is not right to initiate it; or maybe because we don’t have the necessary knowledge or strength to accomplish it; or maybe because circumstances will not contribute to its success. Besides this, the devil contrives in every way to paint it as something good so that having inclined us toward it, he could upset our spiritual tranquility or inflict harm on us. That’s why it is necessary for us to diligently examine all our good desires. Better still, do everything after seeking counsel.\"\n\nBegin every action that is for God's sake joyfully (Brock,1997).\n\nMake sure you see to small things, lest otherwise you may push aside important ones (Brock, 1997).\n\n\n\"Do not demand love from your neighbor, because you will suffer if you don’t receive it; but better still, you indicate your love toward your neighbor and you will settle down. In this way, you will lead your neighbor toward love.\n\nDon’t exchange your love toward your neighbor for some type of object, because in having love toward your neighbor, you acquire within yourself Him, Who is most precious in the whole world. Forsake the petty so as to acquire the great; spurn the excessive and everything meaningless so as to acquire the valuable.\n\nShelter the sinner if it brings you no harm. Through this you will encourage him toward repentance and reform — and attract the Lord’s mercy to yourself. With a kind word and all possible means, fortify the infirm and the sorrowful and that Right Arm that controls everything, will also support you. With prayers and sorrow of your heart, share your lot with the aggrieved and the source of God’s mercy will open to your entreaties.\n\nWhen giving, give magnanimously with a look of kindness on your face, and give more than what is asked of you.\n\nDo not distinguish the worthy from the unworthy. Let everyone be equal to you for good deeds, so that you may be able to also attract the unworthy toward goodness, because through outside acts, the soul quickly learns to be reverent before God.\n\nHe who shows kindness toward the poor has God as his guardian, and he who becomes poor for the sake of God will acquire abundant treasures. God is pleased when He sees people showing concern for others for His sake. When someone asks you for something, don’t think: \"Just in case I might need it, I shall leave it for myself, and God — through other people — will give that person what he requires.\" These types of thoughts are peculiar to people that are iniquitous and do not know God. A just and generous person would not compromise the honor of helping and relinquish it to another person, and he would never pass up an opportunity to help. Every beggar and every needy person receives the necessary essentials, because God doesn’t neglect anyone. But you, having sent away the destitute with nothing, spurned the honor offered to you by God and thereby, distanced yourself from His grace.\n\nThrough God’s providence, he who respects every person for God’s sake, privately acquires help from every human being.\"\n\nWacław Hryniewicz (2007) argues that Brocks translation (1995) of the Second Part of Isaac's writings on Gehenna (discovered 1983) confirm claims of earlier Universalist historians such as John Wesley Hanson (1899) that Isaac was an advocate of universal reconciliation.\n\n\n"}

The bishop Josep Torras i Bages, one of the main figures of Catalan nationalism, called him the \"Prince of Catalan poets\". He was also known as \"mossèn\" (Father) Cinto Verdaguer, because of his career as a priest, and informally also simply \"mossèn Cinto\" (with Cinto being a short form of Jacint).\n\nHe was born in Folgueroles, a town on the Plain of Vic, in the \"comarca\" of Osona (Province of Barcelona) to a modest family who valued learning. His father, Josep Verdaguer i Ordeix (Tavèrnoles, 1817 – Folgueroles, 1876), was a brickmason and farmer. His mother, Josepa Santaló i Planes (Folgueroles, 1819–1871), a housewife and farmer, was to exercise great influence over young Jacint, as she conveyed to him a love of literature, especially poetry, and was a deeply religious woman. He was the third of eight children, only three of whom survived. In 1855, at the age of 10, he entered the Seminary of Vic, as was expected for a child who was not the first-born under the system of primogeniture and had to make his livelihood without relying on an inheritance. Until then, he had lived like the other children in his town. The anecdotes told about him show that he stood out from his peers for his intelligence, astuteness and courage, as well as his athletic constitution. He displayed a balanced attitude without any apparent religious inclinations.\n\nIn 1863, when he was 18, he started to work as a tutor for a family at the Can Tona masia (where he also helped out on the farm), while he continued to study. Can Tona is in the municipal district of Sant Martí de Riudeperes, today Calldetenes (Osona). In 1865, he participated in Barcelona's Jocs Florals—or \"Floral Games\"—poetry contest and won four prizes. The next year he won two prizes in the same Jocs Florals.\n\nOn September 24, 1870, he was ordained a priest by the bishop Lluís Jordà in Vic, and in October that same year, he said his first Mass, in the Sant Jordi hermitage. The next day he said his second Mass in the Sant Francesc hermitage near Vic. In 1871, his mother died (January 17) at the age of 52. On September 1 he was appointed bishop coadjutor of the small town of Vinyoles d'Orís and three days later he took up his charge.\n\nIn 1873, he published the \"cant\" (ode or song) \"Passió de Nostre Senyor Jesucrist\" (Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ). He left Vinyoles d'Orís for health reasons and moved to Vic. He went on a trip to Roussillon and saw the mountain, El Canigó, possibly for the first time. In December, he joined the Companyia Transatlàntica trans-Atlantic steamship company as a chaplain because he was prescribed sea air for his health; he embarked in Cádiz bound for Havana.\n\nOn September 8, 1876, his father died at the age of 65. On board the \"Ciudad Condal\", on the return voyage from Cuba, Jacint Verdaguer finished his epic poem \"L'Atlàntida\". In November he entered the palace of the Marquis of Comillas as an alms chaplain.\n\nIn 1877, when he was 32, and having returned from his journey, the jury of the Jocs Florals awarded him the special prize of the Diputation of Barcelona for \"L'Atlàntida\". Now he had earned his reputation as a poet.\n\nIn 1878, he traveled to Rome, where he was granted an audience with Pope Leo XIII. They discussed Verdaguer's poem \"L'Atlàntida\". In 1880, as the winner of three prizes in the Jocs Florals, he was proclaimed \"Master of the Gay Sciences\" (\"Mestre en Gai Saber\"). That same year he published his book of poetry, \"Montserrat\", which included \"Llegenda de Montserrat\", a legend (or two) in the form of a poem with 13 cantos.\n\nIn 1883, the Barcelona City Council published a print-run of a hundred thousand copies of his \"Oda a Barcelona\" (Ode to Barcelona), a 46-stanza poem. Such a print-run was quite a remarkable given that the population of Barcelona at the time was 350,000, which would have amounted to about a copy per household. At the age of 39, Verdaguer traveled to Paris, Switzerland, Germany and Russia. On March 21, 1886, when he was 41 years old, Bishop Morgades crowned him 'Poet of Catalonia' in the monastery of Ripoll. He published the epic poem \"Canigó\" and made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\n\nIn 1893, following controversy about aspects of his work as a priest, he left the post of alms chaplain at the Marqués de Comillas' palace. The publication of the trilogy \"Jesús Infant\" was completed, and he was assigned to the sanctuary of La Gleva. For a period, he was stripped of his office as priest, although this was eventually restored. In 1894, the books \"Roser de tot l'any\" and \"Veus del bon pastor\" were published. On March 31 he left the sanctuary of La Gleva.\n\nOn May 17, 1902, on his 57th birthday, he moved from his home at Carrer Aragó 235 in Barcelona to the country house known as Vil·la Joana, in Vallvidrera (Barcelona), where he hoped to convalesce. On June 10, he died in Vil·la Joana, which is now one of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA) heritage sites.\n\nVerdaguer was buried in Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.\n\nAmong his works are: \n\nThe scenic cantata \"Atlàntida\", composed by Manuel de Falla and completed after de Falla's death by Ernesto Halffter, is based on Verdaguer's \"L'Atlàntida\". Manuel de Falla considered this large-scale orchestral piece to be the most important of all his works.\n\nSome of his shorter poems are well known as songs in Catalonia, especially \"L'Emigrant\" (\"Sweet Catalonia, country of my heart...\").\n\nVerdaguer's works are collected in English in: \n\n\n\n"}

One way to state the conjecture is that if \"R\" has no nil ideal, other than {0}, then it has no nil one-sided ideal, other than {0}.\n\nThis question was posed in 1930 by Gottfried Köthe (1905–1989). The Köthe conjecture has been shown to be true for various classes of rings, such as polynomial identity rings and right Noetherian rings, but a general solution remains elusive.\n\nThe conjecture has several different formulations:\n\nA conjecture by Amitsur read: \"If \"J\" is a nil ideal in \"R\", then \"J\"[\"x\"] is a nil ideal of the polynomial ring \"R\"[\"x\"].\" This conjecture, if true, would have proven the Köthe conjecture through the equivalent statements above, however a counterexample was produced by Agata Smoktunowicz. While not a disproof of the Köthe conjecture, this fueled suspicions that the Köthe conjecture may be false in general.\n\nIn , it was proven that a ring which is the direct sum of two nilpotent subrings is itself nilpotent.

{"id": "30862446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30862446", "title": "Moroccan Arabic", "text": "Moroccan Arabic\n\nMoroccan Arabic language or Moroccan Darija (, in Morocco) is a member of the Maghrebi Arabic language continuum spoken in Morocco. It is mutually intelligible to some extent with Algerian Arabic language and to a lesser extent with Tunisian Arabic language. It has been heavily influenced mainly by the Berber languages and to a lesser extent by Latin (African Romance), French, and Spanish.\n\nWhile Modern Standard Arabic is not spoken in daily life and is an only used for written government communications and in the written press, Moroccan is the spoken common language of Morocco, and has a strong presence in Moroccan television entertainment, cinema and commercial advertising. \n\nSahrawi Hassaniya Arabic spoken in the disputed Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara is usually considered as a separate spoken Arabic language and is poorly mutually intelligible with Moroccan Arabic. \n\nMoroccan language has many regional dialects and accents as well. Its mainstream dialect is the one used in Casablanca, Rabat and Fas and therefore it dominates the media eclipsing the other regional dialects like the ones spoken in Tangiers and Oujda. \n\nMoroccan is spoken as a first language by about 50% to 75% of Morocco's population. The other half speaks one of the Tamazight languages. Educated Moroccan Tamazight-speakers can communicate in mainstream Moroccan Arabic. \n\nMoroccan language was formed of several dialects of Arabic several belonging to two genetically different groups: pre-Hilalian and Hilalian dialects.\n\nPre-Hilalian dialects are a result of early Arabization phases of the Maghreb, from the 7th to the 12th centuries, concerning the main urban settlements, the harbors, the religious centres (\"zaouias\") as well as the main trade routes. The dialects are generally classified in three types: (old) urban, \"village\" and \"mountain\" sedentary and Jewish dialects. In Morocco, several pre-Hilalian dialects are spoken:\n\nHilalian, or Bedouin, dialects were introduced to Morocco following the settlement of several Hilalian and Mâqilian tribes in western Morocco brought by the Berber Almohad king Yaqub Mansur.\n\nThe Hilalian dialects spoken in Morocco belong to the Mâqil subgroup, a family that includes three main dialectal areas: western Morocco (Doukkala, Abda, Tadla, Chaouia, Gharb, Zaers and Sraghna), eastern Morocco (L'Oriental and the Oujda area) and western Algeria (central and western ), and the southernmost Hassaniya area (southern Morocco, Western Sahara and Mauritania). Among the dialects, Hassaniya is often considered as distinct from Moroccan Darija.\n\nModern urban koines are also based on the Hilalian dialects and have mainly Hilalian features.\n\nAccording to Elimam's studies, the origin of this language would go back to over 3,000 years, being a singular evolution of the Punic language spoken by the Carthaginians under Amazigh influence. This Semitic language would be strongly Arabized after the Arab invasion to be virtually assimilated into the language of the conquerors.\n\nMoroccan language is characterized by a strong Amazigh as well as Latin (African Romance) stratum.\n\nFollowing the Arab conquest, Amazigh languages remained widely spoken. During their Arabisation, some Amazigh tribes became bilingual for generations before abandoning their language for Arabic; however, they kept a substantial Amazigh stratum that increases from the east to the west of the Maghreb, making Moroccan dialects the ones most influenced by Amazigh.\n\nMore recently, the influx of Andalusi people and Spanish-speaking–Moriscos (between the 15th and the 17th centuries) influenced urban dialects with Spanish substrate (and loanwords).\n\nMost vocabulary of Moroccan Arabic language is derived from Classical Arabic and Amazigh, supplemented by French and Spanish loanwords. \n\nThere are noticeable lexical differences between Moroccan and most other Arabic languages. Some words are essentially unique to Moroccan: \"daba\" \"now\". Many others, however, are characteristic of Maghrebi Arabic as a whole including both innovations and unusual retentions of Classical vocabulary that disappeared elsewhere, such as \"hbeṭ\"' \"go down\" from Classical \"habaṭ\". Others are shared with Algerian Arabic such as \"hḍeṛ\" \"talk\", from Classical \"hadhar\" \"babble\", and \"temma\" \"there\", from Classical \"thamma\".\n\nThere are a number of Moroccan language dictionaries in existence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome loans might have come through Andalusi Arabic brought by Moriscos when they were expelled from Spain following the Christian Reconquest or, alternatively, they date from the time of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco.\n\n\n\nThey are used in several coastal cities across the Moroccan coast like Oualidia, El Jadida, and Tangier.\n\n\n\n\nNote: All sentences are written according to the transcription used in Richard Harrell, \"A Short Reference Grammar of Moroccan Arabic\" (Examples with their pronunciation).:\n\nOne of the most notable features of Moroccan language is the collapse of short vowels. Initially, short and were merged into a phoneme (however, some speakers maintain a difference between and when adjacent to pharyngeal and ). This phoneme was then deleted entirely in most positions; for the most part, it is maintained only in the position /...CəC#/ or /...CəCC#/ (where C represents any consonant and # indicates a word boundary), i.e. when appearing as the last vowel of a word. When is not deleted, it is pronounced as a very short vowel, tending towards in the vicinity of emphatic consonants, in the vicinity of pharyngeal and (for speakers who have merged /ă/ and in this environment), and elsewhere. Original short usually merges with except in the vicinity of a labial or velar consonant. In positions where was deleted, /ŭ/ was also deleted, and is maintained only as labialization of the adjacent labial or velar consonant; where is maintained, surfaces as . This deletion of short vowels can result in long strings of consonants (a feature shared with Amazigh and certainly derived from it). These clusters are never simplified; instead, consonants occurring between other consonants tend to syllabify, according to a sonorance hierarchy. Similarly, and unlike most other Arabic dialects, doubled consonants are never simplified to a single consonant, even when at the end of a word or preceding another consonant.\n\nSome dialects are more conservative in their treatment of short vowels. For example, some dialects allow in more positions. Dialects of the Sahara, and eastern dialects near the border of Algeria, preserve a distinction between and and allow to appear at the beginning of a word, e.g. \"shorter\" (standard ), \"go up!\" (standard or ), \"friends\" (standard ).\n\nLong , and are maintained as semi-long vowels, which are substituted for both short and long vowels in most borrowings from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Long and also have many more allophones than in most other dialects; in particular, appear as in the vicinity of emphatic consonants and , , , , but elsewhere. (Most other Arabic dialects only have a similar variation for the phoneme .) In some dialects, such as that of Marrakech, front-rounded and other allophones also exist. Allophones in vowels usually do not exist in loanwords.\n\nEmphatic spreading (i.e. the extent to which emphatic consonants affect nearby vowels) occurs much less than in many other dialects. Emphasis spreads fairly rigorously towards the beginning of a word and into prefixes, but much less so towards the end of a word. Emphasis spreads consistently from a consonant to a directly following vowel, and less strongly when separated by an intervening consonant, but generally does not spread rightwards past a full vowel. For example, \"eggs\" ( and both affected), \"sparks\" (rightmost not affected), \"stairs\" ( usually not affected), \"she hit him\" (with variable but tending to be in between and ; no effect on ), \"student\" ( affected but not ). Contrast, for example, Egyptian Arabic, where emphasis tends to spread forward and backward to both ends of a word, even through several syllables.\n\nEmphasis is audible mostly through its effects on neighboring vowels or syllabic consonants, and through the differing pronunciation of and . Actual pharyngealization of \"emphatic\" consonants is weak and may be absent entirely. In contrast with some dialects, vowels adjacent to emphatic consonants are pure; there is no diphthong-like transition between emphatic consonants and adjacent front vowels.\n\nPhonetic notes: \n\nMoroccan Darija is not often written (most books and magazines are in French, Spanish, or Modern Standard Arabic; most Qur'an books are written in French, Spanish, Classical Arabic, or Modern Standard Arabic), and there is no universally standard written system. There is also a loosely standardized Latin system used for writing Moroccan Darija in electronic media, such as texting and chat, often based on sound-letter correspondences from French, English or Spanish ('sh' or 'ch' for English 'sh', 'u' or 'ou' for English 'u', etc.) and using numbers to represent sounds not found in French or English (2-3-6-7-9 used for ق-ح-ط-ع-ء).\n\nHowever, most systems used for writing Moroccan Darija in linguistic works largely agree among each other. A Moroccan alphabet, \"Abazidiya Magribiya\", is being developed: http://www.ktbdarija.com/old/\n\nkh = ﺥ \"ḫā\" [x]\n\ngh = ﻍ \"ġayn\" [ɣ]\n\nsh = ش \"šīn\" [ʃ]\n\nâ = ﻉ \"ʿayn\" [ʔˤ]\n\nh = ﺡ \"ḥā\" [ħ]\n\nq = ﻕ \"qāf\" [q]\n\nLong (aka \"stable\") vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ are written \"a, i, u\". \"e\" represents /ə/ and o represents /ŭ/ (see section on phonology, above). \"ă\" is used for /ă/ in speakers who still have this phoneme in the vicinity of pharyngeal and .\"ă\", \"ĭ\", and \"o\" are also used for ultrashort vowels used by educated speakers for the short vowels of some recent borrowings from MSA.\n\nIn practice, /ə/ is usually deleted when it is not the last vowel of a word. Some authors omit in transcription: \"ka-t-ktb-u\" \"You are (plural) writing\" instead of \"ka-t-ketb-u\". Others (like Richard Harrell, in his reference grammar of Moroccan Darija) maintain the \"e\", but it never occurs in an open syllable (one ending with a vowel). Instead, the \"e\" is transposed with the preceding (sometimes geminated) consonant, which ends up following \"e\", known as \"inversion\".\n\n\"y\" represents /j/.\n\n\"ḥ\" and \"ʿ\" represent pharyngeal and .\n\n\"ġ\" and \"x\" represent velar and .\n\n\"ṭ, ḍ, ṣ, ẓ, ṛ, ḷ\" represent emphatic .\n\n\"š, ž\" represent hushing .\n\nThe regular Moroccan verb conjugates with a series of prefixes and suffixes. The stem of the conjugated verb may change a bit, depending on the conjugation:\n\nThe stem of the Moroccan verb for \"to write\" is \"kteb\".\n\nThe past tense of \"kteb\" (write) is as follows:\n\nI wrote: \"kteb-t\"\n\nYou wrote: \"kteb-ti\" (some regions tend to differentiate between masculine and feminine, the masculine form is \"kteb-t\", the feminine \"kteb-ti\")\n\nHe/it wrote: \"kteb\" (can also be an order to write; kteb er-rissala: Write the letter)\n\nShe/it wrote: \"ketb-et\"\n\nWe wrote: \"kteb-na\"\n\nYou (plural) wrote: \"kteb-tu\" / \"kteb-tiu\n\nThey wrote: \"ketb-u\"\n\nThe stem \"kteb\" turns into \"ketb\" before a vowel suffix because of the process of \"inversion\" described above.\n\nThe present tense of \"kteb\" is as follows:\n\nI am writing: \"ka-ne-kteb\"\n\nYou/ae (masculine) writing: \"ka-te-kteb\"\n\nYou are (feminine) writing: \"ka-t-ketb-i\"\n\nHe's/it is writing: \"ka-ye-kteb\"\n\nShe is/it is writing: \"ka-te-kteb\"\n\nWe are writing: \"ka-n-ketb-u\"\n\nYou (plural) are writing: \"ka-t-ketb-u\"\n\nThey are writing: \"ka-y-ketb-u\"\n\nThe stem \"kteb\" turns into \"ketb\" before a vowel suffix because of the process of \"inversion\" described above. Between the prefix \"ka-n-, ka-t-, ka-y-\" and the stem \"kteb\", an \"e\" appears but not between the prefix and the transformed stem \"ketb\" because of the same restriction that produces inversion.\n\nIn the north, \"you are writing\" is always \"ka-de-kteb\" regardless of who is addressed.\nThis is also the case of \"de\" in \"de-kteb\" as northerners prefer to use \"de\" and southerners prefer \"te\".\n\nInstead of the prefix \"ka\", some speakers prefer the use of \"ta\" (\"ta-ne-kteb\" \"I am writing\"). The coexistence of these two prefixes is from historic differences. In general, \"ka\" is more used in the north and \"ta\" in the south, some other prefixes like \"la\", \"a\", \"qa\" are less used. In some regions like in the east (Oujda), most speakers use no preverb (\"ne-kteb\", \"te-kteb\", \"y-kteb\", etc.).\n\nTo form the future tense, the prefix \"ka-/ta-\" is removed and replaced with the prefix \"ġa-\", \"ġad-\" or \"ġadi\" instead (e.g. \"ġa-ne-kteb\" \"I will write\", \"ġad-ketb-u\" (north) or \"ġadi t-ketb-u\" \"You (plural) will write\").\n\nFor the subjunctive and infinitive, the \"ka-\" is removed (\"bġit ne-kteb\" \"I want to write\", \"bġit te-kteb\" \"I want 'you to write\").\n\nThe imperative is conjugated with the suffixes of the present tense but without any prefixes or preverbs:\n\n\"kteb\" Write! (masculine singular)\n\n\"ketb-i\" Write! (feminine singular)\n\n\"ketb-u\" Write! (plural)\n\nOne characteristic of Moroccan syntax, which it shares with other North African varieties as well as some southern Levantine dialect areas, is in the two-part negative verbal circumfix . (In many regions, including Marrakech, the final vowel is not pronounced so it becomes .)\n\n\n/ma-/ comes from the Classical Arabic negator /ma/. /-ʃi/ is a development of Classical /ʃayʔ/ \"thing\". The development of a circumfix is similar to the French circumfix \"ne ... pas\" in which \"ne\" comes from Latin \"non\" \"not\" and \"pas\" comes from Latin \"passus\" \"step\". (Originally, \"pas\" would have been used specifically with motion verbs, as in \"I did not walk a step\". It was generalised to other verbs.)\n\nThe negative circumfix surrounds the entire verbal composite, including direct and indirect object pronouns:\n\n\nFuture and interrogative sentences use the same circumfix (unlike, for example, in Egyptian Arabic). Also, unlike in Egyptian Arabic, there are no phonological changes to the verbal cluster as a result of adding the circumfix. In Egyptian Arabic, adding the circumfix can trigger stress shifting, vowel lengthening and shortening, elision when /ma-/ comes into contact with a vowel, addition or deletion of a short vowel, etc. However, they do not ccur in Moroccan Darija (MA):\n\nNegative pronouns such as walu \"nothing\", ḥta ḥaja \"nothing\" and ḥta waḥed \"nobody\" can be added to the sentence without ši as a suffix:\n\nNote that wellah ma-ne-kteb could be a response to a command to write kteb while wellah ma-ġa-ne-kteb could be an answer to a question like waš ġa-te-kteb? \"Are you going to write?\"\n\nIn the north, \"'you are writing\" is always \"ka-de-kteb\" regardless of who is addressed. It is also the case of de in \"de-kteb\", as northerners prefer to use \"de\" and southerners prefer \"te\".\n\nInstead of the prefix \"ka\", some speakers prefer the use of \"ta\" (\"ta-ne-kteb\" \"I am writing\"). The co-existence of these two prefixes is from historical differences. In general \"ka\" is more used in the north and \"ta\" in the south. In some regions like the east (Oujda), most speakers ue no preverb:\n\nVerbs in Moroccan are based on a consonantal root composed of three or four consonants. The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb. Changes to the vowels between the consonants, along with prefixes and/or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person and number in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive.\n\nEach particular lexical verb is specified by two stems, one used for the past tense and one used for non-past tenses, along with subjunctive and imperative moods. To the former stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number and gender. To the latter stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) The third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the \"dictionary form\" used to identify a verb like the infinitive in English. (Arabic has no infinitive.) For example, the verb meaning \"write\" is often specified as \"kteb\", which actually means \"he wrote\". In the paradigms below, a verb will be specified as \"kteb/ykteb\" (\"kteb\" means \"he wrote\" and \"ykteb\" means \"he writes\"), indicating the past stem (\"kteb-\") and the non-past stem (also \"-kteb-\", obtained by removing the prefix \"y-\").\n\nThe verb classes in Moroccan are formed along two axes. The first or \"derivational\" axis (described as \"form I\", \"form II\", etc.) is used to specify grammatical concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive and mostly involves varying the consonants of a stem form. For example, from the root K-T-B \"write\" are derived form I \"kteb/ykteb\" \"write\", form II \"ketteb/yketteb\" \"cause to write\", form III \"kateb/ykateb\" \"correspond with (someone)\" etc. The second or \"weakness\" axis (described as \"strong\", \"weak\", \"hollow\", \"doubled\" or \"assimilated\") is determined by the specific consonants making up the root, especially whether a particular consonant is a \"w\" or \" y\", and mostly involves varying the nature and location of the vowels of a stem form. For example, so-called \"weak\" verbs have one of those two letters as the last root consonant, which is reflected in the stem as a final vowel instead of a final consonant (ṛma/yṛmi \"throw\" from Ṛ-M-Y). Meanwhile, \"hollow\" verbs are usually caused by one of those two letters as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs have a full vowel (/a/, /i/ or /u/) before the final consonant, often along with only two consonants (\"žab/yžib\" \"bring\" from Ž-Y-B).\n\nIt is important to distinguish between strong, weak, etc. \"stems\" and strong, weak, etc. \"roots\". For example, X-W-F is a hollow \"root\", but the corresponding form II stem \"xuwwef/\"yxuwwef\" \"frighten\" is a strong \"stem\":\n\nIn this section, all verb classes and their corresponding stems are listed, excluding the small number of irregular verbs described above. Verb roots are indicated schematically using capital letters to stand for consonants in the root:\nHence, the root F-M-L stands for all three-consonant roots, and F-S-T-L stands for all four-consonant roots. (Traditional Arabic grammar uses F-ʕ-L and F-ʕ-L-L, respectively, but the system used here appears in a number of grammars of spoken Arabic dialects and is probably less confusing for English speakers since the forms are easier to pronounce than those involving /ʕ/.)\n\nThe following table lists the prefixes and suffixes to be added to mark tense, person, number, gender and the stem form to which they are added. The forms involving a vowel-initial suffix and corresponding stem or are highlighted in silver. The forms involving a consonant-initial suffix and corresponding stem are highlighted in gold. The forms involving no suffix and corresponding stem or are not highlighted.\n\nThe following table lists the verb classes along with the form of the past and non-past stems, active and passive participles, and verbal noun, in addition to an example verb for each class.\n\nNotes:\n\nExample: kteb/ykteb \"write\"\n\nSome comments:\n\nExample: kteb/ykteb \"write\": non-finite forms\n\nExample: dker/ydker \"mention\"\n\nThis paradigm differs from kteb/ykteb in the following ways:\nReduction and assimilation occur as follows:\nExamples:\n\nExample: xrˤeʒ/yxrˤoʒ \"go out\"\n\nExample: beddel/ybeddel \"teach\"\n\nBoldfaced forms indicate the primary differences from the corresponding forms of kteb, which apply to many classes of verbs in addition to form II strong:\n\nExample: sˤaferˤ/ysˤaferˤ \"travel\"\n\nThe primary differences from the corresponding forms of beddel (shown in boldface) are:\n\nExample: ttexleʕ/yttexleʕ \"get scared\"\n\nWeak verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant.\n\nExample: nsa/ynsa \"forget\"\n\nThe primary differences from the corresponding forms of kteb (shown in ) are:\n\nExample: rˤma/yrˤmi \"throw\"\n\nThis verb type is quite similar to the weak verb type nsa/ynsa. The primary differences are:\nVerbs other than form I behave as follows in the non-past:\nExamples:\n\nHollow have a W or Y as the middle root consonant. Note that for some forms (e.g. form II and form III), hollow verbs are conjugated as strong verbs (e.g. form II \"ʕeyyen/yʕeyyen\" \"appoint\" from ʕ-Y-N, form III \"ʒaweb/yʒaweb\" \"answer\" from ʒ-W-B).\n\nExample: baʕ/ybiʕ \"sell\"\n\nThis verb works much like beddel/ybeddel \"teach\". Like all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant, the prefixes differ in the following way from those of regular and weak form I verbs:\n\nIn addition, the past tense has two stems: beʕ- before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and baʕ- elsewhere (third person).\n\nExample: ʃaf/yʃuf \"see\"\n\nThis verb class is identical to verbs such as baʕ/ybiʕ except in having stem vowel /u/ in place of /i/.\n\nDoubled verbs have the same consonant as middle and last root consonant, e.g. ɣabb/yiħebb \"love\" from Ħ-B-B.\n\nExample: ħebb/yħebb \"love\"\n\nThis verb works much like baʕ/ybiʕ \"sell\". Like that class, it has two stems in the past, which are ħebbi- before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and ħebb- elsewhere (third person). Note that /i-/ was borrowed from the weak verbs; the Classical Arabic equivalent form would be *ħabáb-, e.g. *ħabáb-t.\n\nSome verbs have /o/ in the stem: koħħ/ykoħħ \"cough\".\n\nAs for the other forms:\n\n\"Doubly weak\" verbs have more than one \"weakness\", typically a W or Y as both the second and third consonants. This term is in fact a misnomer, as such verbs actually behave as normal weak verbs (e.g. ħya/yħya \"live\" from Ħ-Y-Y, quwwa/yquwwi \"strengthen\" from Q-W-Y, dawa/ydawi \"treat, cure\" from D-W-Y).\n\nThe irregular verbs are as follows:\n\n\nIn general, Moroccan language is one of the most innovative (in the technical sense of \"least conservative\") of all Arabic languages. Now, Moroccan language or Darija continues to integrate new French words, mainly technological and modern words. However, in recent years, constant exposure to revived classical forms on television and in print media and a certain desire among many Moroccans for a revitalization of an Arab identity has inspired many Moroccans to integrate words from Modern Standard Arabic, replacing their French or Spanish counterparts or even speaking in Modern Standard Arabic while keeping the Moroccan accent to sound less pedantic. The phenomenon mostly occurs among literate people.\n\nThough rarely written, Moroccan language is currently undergoing an unexpected and pragmatic revival. It is now the preferred language in Moroccan chat rooms or for sending SMS, using Arabic Chat Alphabet composed of Latin letters supplemented with the numbers \"2\", \"3\", \"5\", \"7\" and \"9\" for coding specific Arabic sounds, as is the case with other Arabic speakers.\n\nThe language continues to evolve quickly as can be noted by consulting the Colin dictionary. Many words and idiomatic expressions recorded between 1921 and 1977 are now obsolete.\n\nSome Moroccan speakers, in the territory previously known as French Morocco, also practice code-switching. In the northern parts of Morocco, as in Tetouan & Tangier, it is common for code-switching to occur between Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, and Spanish, as Spain had previously controlled part of the region and continues to possess the territories of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa bordering only Morocco. On the other hand, some Arab nationalist Moroccans generally attempt to avoid French and Spanish in their speech, consequently, their speech tends to resemble old Andalusian Arabic.\n\nThere exists some poetry written in Moroccan language like the Malhun. In the troubled and autocratic Morocco of the 1970s, Years of Lead, the legendary Nass El Ghiwane band wrote beautiful and allusive lyrics in Moroccan that were very appealing to the youth even in other Maghreb countries.\n\nAnother interesting movement is the development of an original rap music scene, which explores new and innovative usages of the language.\n\nThe first known scientific productions written in Moroccan were released on the Web in early 2010 by Moroccan teacher and physician Farouk Taki El Merrakchi, three average-sized books dealing with physics and mathematics (Example here).\n\nThere are now at least three newspapers in Moroccan language; their aim is to bring information to people with a low level of education. From September 2006 to October 2010, \"Telquel\" Magazine had a Moroccan language edition Nichane. There is also a free weekly magazine that is entirely written in \"standard\" Moroccan language: \"Khbar Bladna\" ('News of Our Country').\n\nThe Moroccan online newspaper \"Goud\" or \"گود\" has much of its content written in Moroccan Darija rather than Modern Standard Arabic. Its name \"Goud\" and its slogan \"dima nishan\" (ديما نيشان) are Moroccan Darija expressions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is spoken in southern France, Italy's Occitan Valleys, Monaco, and Spain's Val d'Aran; collectively, these regions are sometimes referred to as Occitania. Occitan is also spoken in the linguistic enclave of Guardia Piemontese (Calabria, Italy). However, there is controversy about the unity of the language, as some think that Occitan is a macrolanguage. Others include Catalan in this family, as the distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon language) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. In fact, Catalan was considered an Occitan dialect until the end of the 19th century.\n\nToday, Occitan is an official language in Catalonia, where a subdialect of Gascon known as Aranese is spoken in the Val d'Aran. Occitan's closest relative is Catalan. Since September 2010, the Parliament of Catalonia has considered Aranese Occitan to be the officially preferred language for use in the Val d'Aran.\n\nAcross history, the terms Limousin (\"Lemosin\"), Languedocien (\"Lengadocian\"), Gascon, and later Provençal (\"Provençal\", \"Provençau\" or \"Prouvençau\") have been used as synonyms for the whole of Occitan; nowadays, \"Provençal\" is understood mainly as the Occitan dialect spoken in Provence, in southeast France.\n\nUnlike other Romance languages such as French or Spanish, there is no single written standard language called \"Occitan\", and Occitan has no official status in France, home to most of Occitania. Instead, there are competing norms for writing Occitan, some of which attempt to be pan-dialectal, whereas others are based on particular dialects. These efforts are hindered by the rapidly declining use of Occitan as a spoken language in much of southern France, as well as by the significant differences in phonology and vocabulary among different Occitan dialects.\n\nIn particular, the northern and easternmost dialects have more morphological and phonetic features in common with the Gallo-Italic and Oïl languages (e.g. nasal vowels; loss of final consonants; initial \"cha/ja-\" instead of \"ca/ga-\"; uvular; the front-rounded sound instead of a diphthong, instead of before a consonant), whereas the southernmost dialects have more features in common with the Ibero-Romance languages (e.g. betacism; voiced fricatives between vowels in place of voiced stops; -\"ch\"- in place of -\"it\"-), and Gascon has a number of unusual features not seen in other dialects (e.g. in place of ; loss of between vowels; intervocalic \"-r-\" and final \"-t/ch\" in place of medieval --). There are also significant lexical differences, where some dialects have words cognate with French, and others have Catalan and Spanish cognates (\"maison\"/\"casa\" \"house\", \"testa\"/\"cap\" \"head\", \"petit\"/\"pichon\" \"small\", \"achaptar\"/\"crompar\" \"to buy\", \"entendre\"/\"ausir\" \"to hear\", \"se taire\"/\"se calar\" \"to be quiet\", \"tombar\"/\"caire\" \"to fall\", \"p(l)us\"/\"mai\" \"more\", \"totjorn\"/\"sempre\" \"always\", etc.). Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of mutual intelligibility.\n\nThe long-term survival of Occitan is in grave doubt. According to the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages, four of the six major dialects of Occitan (Provençal, Auvergnat, Limousin and Languedocien) are considered severely endangered, whereas the remaining two (Gascon and Vivaro-Alpine) are considered definitely endangered.\n\nThe name Occitan comes from \"lenga d'òc\" (\"language of òc\"), \"òc\" being the Occitan word for \"yes.\" While the term would have been in use orally for some time after the decline of Latin, as far as historical records show, the Italian medieval poet Dante was the first to have recorded the term \"lingua d'oc\" in writing. In his \"De vulgari eloquentia\", he wrote in Latin, \"nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil\" (\"for some say \"òc\", others \"sì\", yet others say \"oïl\"\"), thereby highlighting three major Romance literary languages that were well known in Italy, based on each language's word for \"yes\", the \"òc language\" (Occitan), the \"oïl language\" (French), and the \"sì language\" (Sicilian and Italian). This was not, of course, the only defining characteristic of each group.\n\nThe word \"òc\" came from Vulgar Latin \"hoc\" (\"this\"), while \"oïl\" originated from Latin \"hoc illud\" (\"this [is] it\"). Old Catalan, and now the Catalan of Northern Catalonia also have \"hoc\" (\"òc\"). Other Romance languages derive their word for \"yes\" from the Latin \"sic,\" \"thus [it is], [it was done], etc.\", such as Spanish \"sí\", Eastern Lombard \"sé\", Sicilian and Italian \"sì\", or Portuguese \"sim\". In Modern Catalan, as in modern Spanish, \"sí\" is usually used as a response, although the language retains the word \"oi\", akin to \"òc\", which is sometimes used at the end of yes–no questions, and also in higher register as a positive response. French uses \"si\" to answer \"yes\" in response to questions that are asked in the negative sense: e.g., \"Vous n'avez pas de frères?\" \"Si, j'en ai sept.\" (\"You have no brothers?\" \"Yes [I do], I have seven.\").\n\nThe name \"Occitan\" was attested around 1300 as \"occitanus\", a crossing of \"oc\" and \"aquitanus\" (Aquitanian).\n\nFor many centuries, the Occitan dialects (together with Catalan) were referred to as \"Limousin\" or \"Provençal\", after the names of two regions lying within the modern Occitan-speaking area. After Frédéric Mistral's Félibrige movement in the 19th century, Provençal achieved the greatest literary recognition and so became the most popular term for Occitan.\n\nAccording to Joseph Anglade, a philologist and specialist of medieval literature who helped impose the then archaic term \"Occitan\" as the sole correct name, the word \"Lemosin\" was first used to designate the language at the beginning of the 13th century by Catalan troubadour Raimon Vidal de Besalú(n) in his \"Razós de trobar\":\n\n\"La parladura Francesca val mais et [es] plus avinenz a far romanz e pasturellas; mas cella de Lemozin val mais per far vers et cansons et serventés; et per totas las terras de nostre lengage son de major autoritat li cantar de la lenga Lemosina que de negun'autra parladura, per qu'ieu vos en parlarai primeramen.\"\n\nThe French language is worthier and better suited for romances and pastourelles; but that (language) from Limousin is of greater value for writing poems and cançons and sirventés; and across the whole of the lands where our tongue is spoken, the literature in the Limousin language has more authority than any other dialect, wherefore I shall use this name in priority.\nAs for the word \"Provençal\", it should not be taken as strictly meaning the language of Provence, but of Occitania as a whole, for \"in the eleventh, the twelfth, and sometimes also the thirteenth centuries, one would understand under the name of Provence the whole territory of the old Provincia Romana and even Aquitaine\". The term first came into fashion in Italy.\n\nCurrently, linguists use the terms \"Provençal\" and \"Limousin\" strictly to refer to specific varieties within Occitania, keeping the name \"Occitan\" for the language as a whole. Many non-specialists, however, continue to refer to the language as Provençal, causing some confusion.\n\nOne of the oldest written fragments of the language found dates back to 960, in an official text that was mixed with Latin:De ista hora in antea non DECEBRÀ Ermengaus filius Eldiarda Froterio episcopo filio Girberga NE Raimundo filio Bernardo vicecomite de castello de Cornone... NO·L LI TOLRÀ NO·L LI DEVEDARÀ NI NO L'EN DECEBRÀ... nec societatem non AURÀ, si per castellum recuperare NON O FA, et si recuperare potuerit in potestate Froterio et Raimundo LO TORNARÀ, per ipsas horas quæ Froterius et Raimundus L'EN COMONRÀ.\"\n\nCarolingian litanies (c. 780), both written and sung in Latin, were answered to in Old Occitan by the audience (\"Ora pro nos\"; \"Tu lo juva\").\n\nOther famous pieces include the \"Boecis\", a 258-line-long poem written entirely in the Limousin dialect of Occitan between the year 1000 and 1030 and inspired by Boethius's \"The Consolation of Philosophy\"; the Waldensian \"La nobla leyczon\" (dated 1100), \"la Cançó de Santa Fe\" (c. 1054–1076), the \"Romance of Flamenca\" (13th century), the \"Song of the Albigensian Crusade\" (1213–1219?), \"Daurel e Betó\" (12th or 13th century), \"Las, qu'i non sun sparvir, astur\" (11th century) and \"Tomida femina\" (9th or 10th century).\n\nOccitan was the vehicle for the influential poetry of the medieval troubadours (\"trovadores\") and \"trobairitz\": At that time, the language was understood and celebrated throughout most of educated Europe. It was the maternal language of the English queen Eleanor of Aquitaine and kings Richard I of England (who wrote troubadour poetry) and John, King of England. With the gradual imposition of French royal power over its territory, Occitan declined in status from the 14th century on. By the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts (1539) it was decreed that the \"langue d'oïl\" (French - though at the time referring to the Francien language and not the larger collection of dialects grouped under the name Langues d'oïl) should be used for all French administration. Occitan's greatest decline was during the French Revolution, during which diversity of language was considered a threat.\n\nIn 1903 the four Gospels Lis Evangèli i.e. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were translated into the form of Provençal spoken in Cannes and Grasse. This was given the official Roman Catholic Imprimatur by A. Estellon, vicar general.\n\nThe literary renaissance of the late 19th century (which included a Nobel Prize for Frédéric Mistral) was attenuated by World War I, when Occitan speakers spent extended periods of time alongside French-speaking comrades.\n\nBecause the geographical territory in which Occitan is spoken is surrounded by regions in which other Romance languages are used, external influences could have influenced its origin and development. Many factors favoured its development as a language of its own.\n\n\nCatalan in Spain's northern and central Mediterranean coastal regions and the Balearic Islands is closely related to Occitan, sharing many linguistic features and a common origin (see Occitano-Romance languages). The language was one of the first to gain prestige as a medium for literature among Romance languages in the Middle Ages. Indeed, in the 12th and 13th centuries, Catalan troubadours such as Guerau de Cabrera, Guilhem de Bergadan, Guilhem de Cabestany, Huguet de Mataplana, Raimon Vidal de Besalú, Cerverí de Girona, Formit de Perpinhan, and Jofre de Foixà wrote in Occitan.\n\nAt the end of the 11th century, the \"Franks\", as they were called at the time, started to penetrate the Iberian Peninsula through the Ways of St. James via Somport and Roncesvalles, settling on various spots of the Kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon enticed by the privileges granted them by the Navarrese kings. They established themselves in ethnic boroughs where Occitan was used for everyday life, e.g. Pamplona, Sangüesa, Estella-Lizarra, etc. The language in turn became the status language chosen by the Navarrese kings, nobility, and upper classes for official and trade purposes in the period stretching from the early 13th century to late 14th century. These boroughs in Navarre may have been close-knit communities with little mingling, in a context where the natural milieu was predominantly Basque-speaking. The variant chosen for written administrative records was a \"koiné\" based on the Languedocien dialect from Toulouse with fairly archaic linguistic features.\n\nEvidence of a written account in Occitan from Pamplona revolving around the burning of borough San Nicolas from 1258 survives today, while the \"History of the War of Navarre\" by Guilhem Anelier (1276) albeit written in Pamplona shows a linguistic variant from Toulouse.\n\nThings turned out slightly otherwise in Aragon, where the sociolinguistic situation was different, with a clearer Basque-Romance bilingual situation (cf. Basques from the Val d'Aran cited c. 1000), but a receding Basque language (Basque banned in the marketplace of Huesca, 1349). While the language was chosen as a medium of prestige in records and official statements along with Latin in the early 13th century, Occitan faced competition from the rising local Romance vernacular, the Navarro-Aragonese, both orally and in writing, especially after Aragon's territorial conquests south to Zaragoza, Huesca and Tudela between 1118 and 1134. It resulted that a second Occitan immigration of this period was assimilated by the similar Navarro-Aragonese language, which at the same time was fostered and chosen by the kings of Aragon. The language fell into decay in the 14th century across the whole southern Pyrenean area and became largely absorbed into Navarro-Aragonese first and Castilian later in the 15th century, after their exclusive boroughs broke up (1423, Pamplona's boroughs unified).\n\nGascon-speaking communities were called in for trading purposes by Navarrese kings in the early 12th century to the coastal fringe extending from San Sebastian to the Bidasoa River, where they settled down. The language variant used was different from the ones used in Navarre, i.e. a Béarnese dialect of Gascon, with Gascon being in use far longer than in Navarre and Aragon until the 19th century, thanks mainly to the close ties held by Donostia and Pasaia with Bayonne.\n\nThough it was still an everyday language for most of the rural population of southern France well into the 20th century, it is now spoken by about 100,000 people in France according to 2012 estimates.\n\nAccording to the 1999 census, there were 610,000 native speakers (almost all of whom are also native French speakers) and perhaps another million persons with some exposure to the language. Following the pattern of language shift, most of this remainder is to be found among the eldest populations. Occitan activists (called \"Occitanists\") have attempted, in particular with the advent of Occitan-language preschools (the \"Calandretas\"), to reintroduce the language to the young.\n\nNonetheless, the number of proficient speakers of Occitan is dropping precipitously. A tourist in the cities in southern France is unlikely to hear a single Occitan word spoken on the street (or, for that matter, in a home), and is likely to only find the occasional vestige, such as street signs (and, of those, most will have French equivalents more prominently displayed), to remind them of the traditional language of the area.\n\nOccitans, as a result of more than 200 years of conditioned suppression and humiliation (see Vergonha), seldom speak their own language in the presence of foreigners, whether they are from abroad or from outside Occitania (in this case, often merely and abusively referred to as \"Parisiens\" or \"Nordistes\", which means \"northerners\"). Occitan is still spoken by many elderly people in rural areas, but they generally switch to French when dealing with outsiders.\n\nOccitan's decline is somewhat less pronounced in Béarn because of the province's history (a late addition to the Kingdom of France), though even there the language is little spoken outside the homes of the rural elderly. The village of Artix is notable for having elected to post street signs in the local language.\n\n\n\nThe area where Occitan was historically dominant has approximately 16 million inhabitants. Recent research has shown it may be spoken as a first language by approximately 789,000 people in France, Italy, Spain and Monaco. In Monaco, Occitan coexists with Monégasque Ligurian, which is the other native language. Some researchers state that up to seven million people in France understand the language, whereas twelve to fourteen million fully spoke it in 1921. In 1860, Occitan speakers represented more than 39% of the whole French population (52% for francophones proper); they were still 26% to 36% in the 1920s and fewer than 7% in 1993.\n\nOccitan is fundamentally defined by its dialects, rather than being a unitary language. That point is very conflictual in Southern France, as many people do not recognize Occitan as a real language and think that the next defined \"dialects\" are languages. Like other languages that fundamentally exist at a spoken, rather than written, level (e.g. the Rhaeto-Romance languages, Franco-Provençal, Astur-Leonese, and Aragonese), every settlement technically has its own dialect, with the whole of Occitania forming a classic dialect continuum that changes gradually along any path from one side to the other. Nonetheless, specialists commonly divide Occitan into six main dialects:\n\nGascon is the most divergent, and descriptions of the main features of Occitan often consider Gascon separately. Max Wheeler notes that \"probably only its copresence within the French cultural sphere has kept [Gascon] from being regarded as a separate language\", and compares it to Franco-Provençal, which is considered a separate language from Occitan but is \"probably not more divergent from Occitan overall than Gascon is\".\n\nThere is no general agreement about larger groupings of these dialects.\n\nMax Wheeler divides the dialects into two groups:\n\nPierre Bec divides the dialects into three groups:\n\nBec also notes that some linguists prefer a \"supradialectal\" classification that groups Occitan with Catalan as a part of a wider Occitano-Romanic group. One such classification posits three groups:\nAccording to this view, Catalan is an ausbau language that became independent from Occitan during the 13th century, but originates from the Aquitano-Pyrenean group.\n\nDomergue Sumien proposes a slightly different supradialectal grouping.\n\nAll these regional varieties of the Occitan language are written and valid. Standard Occitan, also called \"occitan larg\" (i.e., 'wide Occitan') is a synthesis that respects and admits soft regional adaptations (which are based on the convergence of previous regional koinés). So Occitan can be considered as a pluricentric language. The standardisation process began with the publication of \"Gramatica occitana segon los parlars lengadocians\", grammar of the languedocien dialect, by Louis Alibert (1935), followed by the \"Dictionnaire occitan-français selon les parlers languedociens\" (French-Occitan dictionary according to Languedocien) by the same author (1966), completed during the 1970s with the works of Pierre Bec (Gascon), Robèrt Lafont (Provençal) and others. But it has not been achieved yet. It is mostly supported by users of the classical norm. Due to the strong situation of diglossia, some users still reject the standardisation process and do not conceive Occitan as a language that could work just as other standardised languages.\n\nThere are two main linguistic norms currently used for Occitan, one (known as \"classical\"), which is based on that of Medieval Occitan, and one (sometimes known as \"Mistralian\", due to its use by Frédéric Mistral), which is based on modern French orthography. Sometimes, there is conflict between users of each system.\n\nThere are also two other norms but they have a lesser audience. The \"Escòla dau Pò norm\" (or \"Escolo dóu Po norm\") is a simplified version of the Mistralian norm and is used only in the Occitan Valleys (Italy), besides the classical norm. The \"Bonnaudian norm\" (or \"écriture auvergnate unifiée, EAU\") was created by Pierre Bonnaud and is used only in the Auvergnat dialect, besides the classical norm.\n\nNote that that Catalan version was translated from the Spanish, while the Occitan versions were translated from the French. The second part of the Catalan version may also be rendered as \"Són dotades de raó i de consciència, i els cal actuar entre si amb un esperit de fraternitat\", showing the similarities between Occitan and Catalan.\n\nThe majority of scholars think that Occitan constitutes a single language. Some authors, constituting a minority, reject this opinion and even the name \"Occitan\", thinking that there is a family of distinct rather than dialects of a single language.\n\nMany Occitan linguists and writers, particularly those involved with the pan-Occitan movement centred on the Institut d'Estudis Occitans, disagree with the view that Occitan is a family of languages and think that Limousin, Auvergnat, Languedocien, Gascon, Provençal and Vivaro-Alpine are dialects of a single language. Although there are indeed noticeable differences between these varieties, there is a very high degree of mutual intelligibility between them; they also share a common literary history, and in academic and literary circles, have been identified as a collective linguistic entity—the —for centuries.\n\nSome Provençal authors continue to support the view that Provençal is a separate language. Nevertheless, the vast majority of Provençal authors and associations think that Provençal is a part of Occitan.\n\nThis debate about the status of Provençal should not be confused with the debate concerning the spelling of Provençal.\n\nFor example, the classical system writes \"Polonha\", whereas the Mistralian spelling system has \"Poulougno\", for , 'Poland'.\n\nThe question of Gascon is similar. Gascon presents a number of significant differences from the rest of the language; but, despite these differences, Gascon and other Occitan dialects have very important common lexical and grammatical features, so authors such as Pierre Bec argue that they could never be considered as different as, for example, Spanish and Italian. In addition, Gascon's being included in Occitan despite its particular differences can be justified because there is a common elaboration (\"Ausbau\") process between Gascon and the rest of Occitan. The vast majority of the Gascon cultural movement considers itself as a part of the Occitan cultural movement. And the official status of Val d'Aran (Catalonia, Spain), adopted in 1990, says that Aranese is a part of Gascon and Occitan. A grammar of Aranese by Aitor Carrera, published in 2007 in Lleida, presents the same view.\n\nThe exclusion of Catalan from the Occitan sphere, even though Catalan is closely related, is justified because there has been a consciousness of its being different from Occitan since the later Middle Ages and because the elaboration (\"Ausbau\") processes of Catalan and Occitan (including Gascon) have been quite distinct since the 20th century. Nevertheless, other scholars point out that the process that led to the affirmation of Catalan as a distinct language from Occitan started during the period when the pressure to include Catalan-speaking areas in a mainstream Spanish culture was at its greatest.\n\nThe answer to the question of whether Gascon or Catalan should be considered dialects of Occitan or separate languages has long been a matter of opinion or convention, rather than based on scientific ground. However, two recent studies support Gascon's being considered a distinct language. For the very first time, a quantifiable, statistics-based approach was applied by Stephan Koppelberg in attempt to solve this issue. Based on the results he obtained, he concludes that Catalan, Occitan, and Gascon should all be considered three distinct languages. More recently, Y. Greub and J.P. Chambon (Sorbonne University, Paris) demonstrated that the formation of Proto-Gascon was already complete at the eve of the 7th century, whereas Proto-Occitan was not yet formed at that time. These results induced linguists to do away with the conventional classification of Gascon, favoring the \"distinct language\" alternative. Both studies supported the early intuition of late Kurt Baldinger, a specialist of both medieval Occitan and medieval Gascon, who recommended that Occitan and Gascon be classified as separate languages. However, this statement hurts the Occitanist doctrine, which states as one of its fundamental dogmas, that Gascon is a dialect of Occitan, .\n\nJules Ronjat has sought to characterize Occitan by 19 principal criteria, as generalized as possible. Of those, 11 are phonetic, five morphologic, one syntactic, and two lexical. Close rounded vowels are rare or absent in Occitan. This characteristic often carries through to an Occitan speaker's French, leading to a distinctive \"méridional\" accent. Unlike French, it is a pro-drop language, allowing the omission of the subject (\"canti\": I sing; \"cantas\" you sing). Among these 19 discriminating criteria, 7 are different from Spanish, 8 from Italian, 12 from Franco-Provençal, and 16 from French.\n\nMost features of Occitan are shared with either French or Catalan, or both.\n\nExamples of pan-Occitan features shared with French, but not Catalan:\n\nExamples of pan-Occitan features shared with Catalan, but not French:\n\nExamples of pan-Occitan features not shared with Catalan or French:\n\nExamples of dialect-specific features of the northerly dialects shared with French, but not Catalan:\n\nExamples of dialect-specific features of the southerly dialects (or some of them) shared with Catalan, but not French:\n\nExamples of Gascon-specific features not shared with French or Catalan:\n\nExamples of other dialect-specific features not shared with French or Catalan:\n\nA comparison of terms and word counts between languages is not easy, as it is impossible to count the number of words in a language. (See Lexicon, Lexeme, Lexicography for more information.)\n\nSome have claimed around 450,000 words exist in the Occitan language, a number comparable to English (the Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged with 1993 addenda reaches 470,000 words, as does the Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition). The Merriam-Webster Web site estimates that the number is somewhere between 250,000 and 1 million words.\n\nThe magazine \"Géo\" (2004, p. 79) claims that American English literature can be more easily translated into Occitan than French, excluding modern technological terms that both languages have integrated.\n\nA comparison of the lexical content can find more subtle differences between the languages. For example, Occitan has 128 synonyms related to cultivated land, 62 for wetlands, and 75 for sunshine (\"Géo\"). The language went through an eclipse during the Industrial Revolution, as the vocabulary of the countryside became less important. At the same time, it was disparaged as a patois. Nevertheless, Occitan has also incorporated new words into its lexicon to describe the modern world. The Occitan word for web is \"oèb\", for example.\n\nOne interesting and useful feature of the Occitan language is its virtually infinite ability to create new words through a number of interchangeable and embeddable suffixes, giving the original terms a whole array of semantic nuances.\n\nThe separation of Catalan from Occitan is seen by some as largely politically (rather than linguistically) motivated. However, the variety that has become standard Catalan differs from the one that has become standard Occitan in a number of ways. Here are just a few examples:\n\nDespite these differences, Occitan and Catalan remain more or less mutually comprehensible, especially when written — more so than either is with Spanish or French, for example, although this is mainly a consequence of using the classical (orthographical) norm of the Occitan, which is precisely focused in showing the similarities between the Occitan dialects with Catalan. Occitan and Catalan form a common diasystem (or a common Abstandsprache), which is called Occitano-Romance, according to the linguist Pierre Bec. Speakers of both languages share early historical and cultural heritage.\n\nThe combined Occitano-Romance area is 259,000 km and represents 23 million speakers. However, the regions are not equal in terms of language speakers. According to Bec 1969 (pp. 120–121), in France, no more than a quarter of the population in counted regions could speak Occitan well, though around half understood it; it is thought that the number of Occitan users has decreased dramatically since then. By contrast, in the Catalonia administered by the Government of Catalonia, nearly three quarters of the population speak Catalan and 95% understand it.\n\nOne of the most notable passages of Occitan in Western literature occurs in the 26th \"canto\" of Dante's \"Purgatorio\" in which the troubadour Arnaut Daniel responds to the narrator:\n\nThe above strophe translates to:\n\nAnother notable Occitan quotation, this time from Arnaut Daniel's own 10th \"Canto\":\nModern Occitan:\n\nTranslation:\n\nFrench writer Victor Hugo's classic \"Les Misérables\" also contains some Occitan. In Part One, First Book, Chapter IV, \"Les œuvres semblables aux paroles\", one can read about Monseigneur Bienvenu:\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe Spanish playwright Lope de Rueda included a Gascon servant for comical effect in one of his short pieces, \"La generosa paliza\".\n\nJohn Barnes's \"Thousand Cultures\" science fiction series (\"A Million Open Doors\", 1992; \"Earth Made of Glass\", 1998; \"The Merchants of Souls\", 2001; and \"The Armies of Memory\", 2006), features Occitan.\nSo does the 2005 best-selling novel \"Labyrinth\" by English author Kate Mosse. It is set in Carcassonne, where she owns a house and spends half of the year.\n\nThe French composer Joseph Canteloube created five sets of folk songs entitled \"Songs of the Auvergne\", in which the lyrics are in the Auvergne dialect of Occitan. The orchestration strives to conjure vivid pastoral scenes of yesteryear.\n\nMichael Crichton features Occitan in his \"Timeline\" novel.\n\n\n\n"}

Generally polysynthetic languages have polypersonal agreement although some agglutinative languages that are not polysynthetic also have it, such as Basque, Hungarian and Georgian. Some authors apply the term polysynthetic to languages with high morpheme-to-word ratios, but others use it for languages that are highly head-marking, or those that frequently use noun incorporation.\n\nPolysynthetic languages can be agglutinative or fusional depending on whether they encode one or multiple grammatical categories per affix.\n\nAt the same time, the question of whether to call a particular language polysynthetic is complicated by the fact that morpheme and word boundaries are not always clear cut, and languages may be highly synthetic in one area but less synthetic in other areas (e.g., verbs and nouns in Southern Athabaskan languages or Inuit languages). Many polysynthetic languages display complex evidentiality and/or mirativity systems in their verbs.\n\nThe term was invented by Peter Stephen Du Ponceau, who considered polysynthesis, as characterized by sentence words and noun incorporation, a defining feature of all Native American languages. This characterization was shown to be wrong, since many indigenous American languages are not polysynthetic, but it is a fact that polysynthetic languages are not evenly distributed throughout the world, but more frequent in the Americas, Australia, Siberia, and New Guinea; however, there are also examples in other areas. The concept became part of linguistic typology with the work of Edward Sapir, who used it as one of his basic typological categories. Recently, Mark C. Baker has suggested formally defining polysynthesis as a macro-parameter within Noam Chomsky's principles and parameters theory of grammar. Other linguists question the basic utility of the concept for typology since it covers many separate morphological types that have little else in common.\n\nThe word \"polysynthesis\" is composed of the Greek roots \"poly\" meaning \"many\" and \"synthesis\" meaning \"placing together\".\n\nIn linguistics a word is defined as a unit of meaning that can stand alone in a sentence, and which can be uttered in isolation. Words may be simple, consisting of a single unit of meaning, or they can be complex, formed by combining many small units of meaning, called morphemes. In a general non-theoretical sense polysynthetic languages are those languages that have a high degree of morphological synthesis, and which tend to form long complex words containing long strings of morphemes, including derivational and inflectional morphemes. A language then is \"synthetic\" or \"synthesizing\" if it tends to have more than one morpheme per word, and a polysynthetic language is a language that has \"many\" morphemes per word. The concept was originally used only to describe those languages that can form long words that correspond to an entire sentence in English or other Indo-European languages, and the word is still most frequently used to refer to such \"sentence words\".\n\nOften polysynthesis is achieved when languages have extensive agreement between elements verbs and their arguments so that the verb is marked for agreement with the grammatical subject and object. In this way a single word can encode information about all the elements in a transitive clause. In Indo-European languages the verb is usually only marked for agreement with the subject (e.g. Spanish \"hablo\" \"I speak\" where the -o ending marks agreement with the first person singular subject), but in many languages verbs also agree with the object (e.g. the Kiswahili word \"nakupenda\" \"I love you\" where the \"n-\" prefix marks agreement with the first person singular subject and the \"ku\"- prefix marks agreement with a second person singular object).\n\nMany polysynthetic languages combine these two strategies, and also have ways of inflecting verbs for concepts normally encoded by adverbs or adjectives in Indo-European languages. In this way highly complex words can be formed, for example the Yupik word \"tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq\" which means \"He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer.\" The word consists of the morphemes \"tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq\" with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative, and except for the morpheme \"tuntu\" \"reindeer\", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.\n\nAnother way to achieve a high degree of synthesis is when languages can form compound words by incorporation of nouns, so that entire words can be incorporated into the verb word, as \"baby\" is incorporated in the English verb \"babysit\".\n\nAnother common feature of polysynthetic languages is a tendency to use head marking as a means of syntactic cohesion. This means that many polysynthetic languages mark grammatical relations between verbs and their constituents by indexing the constituents on the verb with agreement morphemes, and the relation between noun phrases and their constituents by marking the head noun with agreement morphemes. There are some dependent-marking languages that may be considered to be polysynthetic because they use case stacking to achieve similar effects, and very long words.\n\nAn example from Chukchi, a polysynthetic, incorporating, and agglutinating language of Russia which also has grammatical cases unlike the majority of incorporating polysynthetic languages:\n\nFrom Classical Ainu of Japan, another polysynthetic, incorporating, and agglutinating language:\n\nThe Mexican language Nahuatl is also considered to be polysynthetic, incorporating and agglutinating. The following verb shows how the verb is marked for subject, patient, object, and indirect object:\n\nThe Australian language Tiwi is also considered highly polysynthetic:\n\nAnd the Canadian First Nation language Mohawk:\n\nAn example from Western Greenlandic, an exclusively suffixing polysynthetic language:\n\nThe term \"polysynthesis\" was first used by Peter Stephen DuPonceau (a.k.a. Pierre Étienne Du Ponceau) in 1819 as a term to describe the structural characteristics of American languages:\n\nThe term was made popular in a posthumously published work by Wilhelm von Humboldt (1836), and it was long considered that all the indigenous languages of the Americas were of the same type. Humboldt considered language structure to be an expression of the psychological stage of evolution of a people, and since Native Americans were considered uncivilized, polysynthesis came to be seen as the lowest stage of grammatical evolution, characterized by a lack of rigorous rules and clear organization known in European languages. Duponceau himself had argued that the complex polysynthetic nature of American languages was a relic of a more civilized past, and that this suggested that the Indians of his time had degenerated from a previous advanced stage. Duponceau's colleague Albert Gallatin contradicted this theory, arguing rather that synthesis was a sign of a lower cultural level, and that while the Greek and Latin languages were somewhat synthetic, Native American languages were much more so – and consequently polysynthesis was the hallmark of the lowest level of intellectual evolution.\n\nThis view was still prevalent when linguist William Dwight Whitney wrote in 1875. He considered polysynthesis to be a general characteristic of American languages, but he did qualify the statement by mentioning that certain languages such as Otomi and the Tupi-Guarani languages had been claimed to be basically analytic.\n\nThe ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton, the first professor of anthropology in the US, followed Duponceau, Gallatin and Humboldt in seeing polysynthesis, which he distinguished from incorporation, as a defining feature of all the languages of the Americas. He defined polysynthesis in this way:\n\nIn the 1890s the question of whether polysynthesis could be considered a general characteristic of Native American languages became a hotly contested issue as Brinton debated the question with John Hewitt. Brinton, who had never done fieldwork with any indigenous group continued to defend Humboldt and Duponceau's view of the exceptional nature of American languages against the claim of Hewitt, who was half Tuscarora and had studied the Iroquoian languages, that languages such as the Iroquois had grammatical rules and verbs just like European languages.\n\nEdward Sapir reacted to the prevailing view in Americanist linguistics which considered the languages of the Americas to belong to a single basic polysynthetic type, arguing instead that American indigenous languages were highly diverse and encompassed all known morphological types. He also built on the work of Leonard Bloomfield who in his 1914 work \"language\" dismissed morphological typology, stating specifically that the term polysynthetic had never been clearly defined.\n\nIn Sapir's 1921 book also titled \"Language\", he argued that instead of using the morphological types as a strict classification scheme it made more sense to classify languages as relatively more or less synthetic or analytic, with the isolating and polysynthetic languages in each of the extremes of that spectrum. He also argued that languages were rarely purely of one morphological type, but used different morphological strategies in different parts of the grammar. \n\nSapir introduced a number of other distinctions according to which languages could be morphologically classified, and proposed combining them to form more complex classifications. He proposed classifying languages both by the degree of synthesis, classifying languages as either analytic, synthetic or polysynthetic, and by the technique used to achieve synthesis, classifying languages as agglutinative, fusional, or symbolic. Among the examples of polysynthetic languages he gave was Haida which he considered to use the agglutinative-isolating technique, Yana and Nootka both of which he considered agglutinative, Chinook and Algonkin which he considered fusional. The Siouan languages he considered \"mildly polysynthetic\" and agglutinative-fusional.\n\nFollowing Sapir's understanding of Polysynthesis, his student Benjamin Lee Whorf proposed a distinction between oligosynthetic and polysynthetic languages, where the former term was applied to languages with a very small number of morphemes of which all other lexical units are composed. No language has been shown to fit the description of an oligosynthetic language and the concept is not in general use in linguistics.\n\nThe sentence structure of polysynthetic languages has been taken as a challenge for linguists working within Noam Chomsky's generative theoretical framework that operates with the assumption that all the world's languages share a set of basic syntactic principles.\n\nEloise Jelinek, having worked with Salishan and Athabascan languages, proposed an analysis of polysynthetic languages in which the morphemes that agree with the arguments of the verb are not just considered indexes of the arguments, but in fact constitute the primary expression of the arguments within the sentence. Because this theory posits that the pronominal agreement morphemes are the true syntactic arguments of the sentence, Jelinek's hypothesis was called the pronominal argument hypothesis. If the hypothesis were correct, it would mean that free standing nouns in such languages did not constitute syntactical arguments, but simply adjoined specifiers or adjuncts. This in turn explained why many polysynthetic languages seem to be non-configurational, i.e. they have no strict rules for word order and seemingly violate many of the basic rules for syntactic structures posited within the generative framework.\n\nIn 1996 Mark C. Baker proposed a definition of polysynthesis as a syntactic macroparameter within Noam Chomsky's \"principles and parameters\" program. He defines polysynthetic languages as languages that conform to the syntactic rule that he calls the \"polysynthesis parameter\", and that as a result show a special set of morphological and syntactic properties. The polysynthesis parameter states that all phrasal heads must be marked with either agreement morphemes of their direct argument or else incorporate these arguments in that head. This definition of polysynthesis leaves out some languages that are commonly stated as examples of polysynthetic languages (such as Inuktitut), but can be seen as the reason for certain common structural properties in others, such as Mohawk and Nahuatl. Baker's definition, probably because of its heavy dependence on generative theory, has not been accepted as a general definition of polysynthesis.\n\nJohanna Mattissen suggests that polysynthetic languages can be fundamentally divided into two typological categories, which differ in the way morphemes are organised to form words. She calls the two types for affixal and compositional polysynthesis respectively.\n\nAffixally polysynthetic languages, as the name suggests, are those that use only non-root-bound morphemes to express concepts that in less synthetic languages are expressed by separate words such as adjectives and adverbs. They also use these bound morphemes to make other nouns and verbs from a basic root, which can lead to very complex word forms without non-lexical suffixes. These bound morphemes often relate to body parts, other essential items of the culture of the language's speakers or features of the landscape where the language is spoken. Deictics and other spatial and temporal relations are also very common among these bound morphemes in affixally polysynthetic languages.\n\nAffixally polysynthetic languages do not use noun incorporation or verb serialisation, since this violates the rule concerning the number of roots allowable per word. Many make a weak distinction between nouns and verbs, which allows using affixes to translate these parts of speech.\n\nAffixally polysynthetic languages may have a word structure that is either\n\nExamples of affixally polysynthetic languages include Inuktitut, Cherokee, Athabaskan languages, the Chimakuan languages (Quileute) and the Wakashan languages.\n\nIn compositionally polysynthetic languages, there usually can be more than one free morpheme per word, which gives rise to noun incorporation and verb serialisation to create extremely long words. Bound affixes, though less important in compositionally polysynthetic languages than in affixally polysynthetic languages, tend to be equally abundant in both types.\n\nIt is believed that all affixally polysynthetic languages evolved from compositionally polysynthetic ones via the conversion of morphemes that could stand on their own into affixes.\n\nBecause they possess a greater number of free morphemes, compositionally polysynthetic languages are much more prone than affixally polysynthetic ones to evolve into simpler languages with less complex words. On the other hand, they are generally easier to distinguish from non-polysynthetic languages than affixally polysynthetic languages.\n\nExamples of compositionally polysynthetic languages include Classical Ainu , Sora, Chukchi, Tonkawa, and most Amazonian languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Poornachandra Tejaswi has a distinguished style of writing which has heralded a new era in Kannada Literature.\n\nTejaswi was born on 8 September 1938 in Kuppali in Shimoga district of Karnataka. Although he was the son of \"Raashtrakavi\" Kuvempu, he came out of his father's shadow and established his own image at an early age. Tejaswi received best story award in the competition held by Prajavani Kannada newspaper on the occasion of Deepavali, for his first short story \"Linga Banda\", a look at the rainy Western Ghats from the eye of a boy. After completion of his education from Maharaja College of Mysore, one among the top colleges in India, due to his interests in nature and farming, he moved to Mudigere taluk of Chikmagalur District after buying a coffee estate. Apart from literature he was actively involved in painting, photography and philosophy.\n\nHe was a keen learner of nature and his favourite pastime was to roam around in the forests of western ghats. He died of cardiac arrest at his farm house Niruttara, Mudigere in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka state, on 5 April 2007 approximately at 2.00 p.m. He was 69 at the time. He has 2 daughters Susmitha and Eshanye who are software professionals. His wife Rajeshwari stays in Niruttara,Mudigere.\n\nTejaswi has written in almost all forms of literature including poems, short stories, novels, travel literature, plays and science fiction. Nature and incidents related to nature enjoy major roles in most of his works. One of the most popular writers in Kannada, Tejaswi's works have continued to remain popular, going into multiple prints and often topping reader's charts. \"Karvalo\" is one such novel where the author participates in an adventure of discovering a flying lizard in the dense forests of Western Ghats.\n\nTejaswi has translated a number of English books to Kannada enriching the depth of Kannada literature. His famous translations include the series on Kenneth Anderson's hunting expeditions and Henri Charrière's \"Papillon\".\n\nTejaswi wrote his first novel, \"Kaadu Mattu Kraurya\", when he was a 24-year-old in 1962. The novel is expected to be in print for the first time towards the end of 2012. He had initially planned to name this work \"Nalini\" but later decided to go by its present title. Tejaswi was inspired to write the novel after visiting his wife Rajeshwari's maternal home in the forested Malnad region of Karnataka.

It normally comprises a folded card containing detailed notes about the stamps, a card with clear strips for holding the actual stamps, all held within a clear sleeve. The packs are usually sold at a price a little above the stamps' face value.\n\nGreat Britain was one of the first countries to produce Commemorative Presentation Packs, with the first Presentation Packs being issued by the General Post Office in 1960, when the GPO was looking for a convenient way of packaging and selling sets of stamps for the London 1960 International Stamp Exhibition, held\nat the Royal Festival Hall. They produced four packs priced in pounds sterling for the exhibition, and another four priced in US dollars for a Post Office sales tour of the USA. Each pack was fairly basic in design and the only information printed on the pack was a brief description of the stamps and the retail price. These first Presentation Packs were produced in very limited numbers and are now commonly known as Forerunners.\n\nIt was in 1964 that the first Commemorative Packs were produced by the GPO. On 23 April, the first ‘proper’ pack was issued for a set of stamps celebrating the Shakespeare Festival, to mark the 400th Anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare. The Presentation Pack was decorative in design and contained information on the stamp designs, the designer and the stamp printer. Early packs were not produced in large numbers and are highly sought after by collectors. The pack for the \"Opening of the Forth Road Bridge\" stamps has a book price of £400 according to the 2010 Stanley Gibbons \"Great Britain Concise Stamp Catalogue\", though they sell on the open market for considerably less! The early packs issued in the 1960s had tight cellophane sleeves causing some to shrink, in turn leading to buckling of the information cards.\n\nThe Post Office viewed the Presentation Pack as a sales tool to attract new customers and impulse buyers. They also developed the range to encourage stamp collecting in other countries, particularly Germany and Japan, by printing packs in those languages.\n\nMany countries around the world (Australia etc..) now issue Presentation Packs in similar formats, being a convenient way to sell and display a whole stamp issue.\n\nSince the first Commemorative Presentation Pack in 1964, there has been an increasing variety of British Presentation Packs released each year. The Presentation Packs have a wide range of subject matter which can be divided into the following categories:\n\n\"Commemorative Packs\" - The most frequently produced and popular packs amongst collectors. They are released by the Royal Mail on the day that the stamps are issued and contain an information card to provide details and images relating to the theme of the stamps. The design of Commemorative Packs continually evolve, with many now containing a stamp Miniature Sheet displayed on the front, or on the reverse. Two Commemorative Packs have been specifically translated into Welsh. The first, the 1969 Investiture of The Prince of Wales, was given to the school children of Wales. The second pack was issued in 1998 for Diana, Princess of Wales, which has proved very popular with collectors.\n\n\"Definitive Packs\" - These packs provide information on the background to Definitive and Country stamps issued by the Royal Mail. The first Definitive Packs were issued on 5 March 1969 - one pack of low value pre-decimal Machin stamps and the other with high value pre-decimal Machin stamps.\n\n\"Collectors Club Packs\" - The Collectors Club was set up to promote stamp collecting for children, as a family activity. It became one of the largest clubs of its kind with 70,000 members worldwide. Only three Presentation Packs were issued specifically for the Collectors Club and they are now difficult to obtain.\n\n\"Forerunner Packs\" - Packs known as Forerunners are considered by many to be the first Presentation Packs issued. They were the inspiration of Frank Langfield, who was developing the philatelic retail department of the General Post Office by promoting stamps to the UK and USA. They were first sold in July 1960 at the International Stamp Exhibition held at Festival Hall, London.\n\n\"Format Packs\" - These stamp Format Packs were specialist products issued by the Royal Mail and contained gutter pairs, cylinder blocks, traffic lights or top left corner of the selvedge of certain stamp issues within a sealed cellophane cover. They were sold at face value, available from the Philatelic Bulletin and selected Post Offices.\n\n\"Greetings Packs\" - Greeting stamps were produced in booklet format. They were first available within a 1992 Presentation Pack. Each pack contained ten 1st Class stamps along with the corresponding labels. Altogether, from 1992 to 1997, six different Greeting Packs were produced.\n\n\"Miniature Sheet Collection Packs\" - The first Miniature Sheet Collection Pack was issued in 2005. Presented in a durable plastic folder. It contained a complete set of the year's miniature sheets with an accompanying information card.\n\n\"Postage Due (To Pay) Packs\" - Four Presentation Packs were issued by the Post Office containing Postage Due (To Pay) labels - the first in 1971 and the last in 1994. All the packs contained information on the background of 'To Pay' labels, which were introduced to Great Britain in 1914.\n\n\"Post & Go Packs\" - Post & Go Packs were introduced in 2009 and have proved popular with collectors. Originally, these packs did not carry premium pricing as they consisted only of self-adhesive stamps on a simple carrier and information card. Royal Mail continues to issue these packs throughout the year, focussing on a specific theme.\n\n\"Reproduction Packs\" - These packs are produced to commemorate special British stamps. The first was issued in 2000 to celebrate the Penny Black. Significant attention to detail goes into the production of these packs, a source of admiration to collectors. For example, the Postal Union Congress London 1929 Reproduction Pack contained stamps produced using the original die but with a watermark effect on the reverse and the word 'facsimile', to clearly distinguish them from the originals.\n\n\"Smilers for Kids\" - These packs were launched by the Post Office on 28 October 2008 with four designs featuring well known children's book characters; Peter Rabbit, Almond Blossom, Mr Happy and Noddy. These special packs were created to appeal to children and contained ten self-adhesive 1st Class stamps on a sheet, plus corresponding labels. Also included in the packs were other items, such as 'New Baby' announcement cards or cut-out masks.\n\n\"Year Books\" - These books were introduced in 1984 by the Post Office as a luxury item. They are hardback books contained within a rigid sleeve for protection. Each book contains an illustrated chapter on every stamp issue for that year, with a full set of the stamps for the collector to place into slip-in mounts on the appropriate pages. In 1995, the Post Office introduced leather-bound Year Books in limited editions.\n\n\"Year Packs\" - These are also known as Gift Packs and Collectors' Packs. The first Year Pack, originally called Gift Pack, was issued at the end of 1967 and contained the stamps for that year. The Royal cypher, embossed in gold on the cover of the pack made this a striking new addition to the GPO product range. In 1968, a Gift Pack was produced containing the commemorative stamps issued between January and August that year. Strangely, the GPO also created a Collectors' Pack, which contained selected stamp issues from 1967 and 1968. From 1969 to 1971, they continued to produce Collectors' Packs containing selected stamps from two years. However, since 1972 packs have been issued with only one year's stamps. The name changed to Year Pack in 1994.\n\n\"Souvenir and Special Edition Packs\" - This category contains a wide range of packs varying in style, content and size. They are all produced by Royal Mail; some were distributed by third parties. The first Special Edition Pack was issued in 1969 when the British Ships Commemorative Pack was reprinted for sale on board the Cunard Line Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship. The original pack had noted that the Queen Elizabeth II 'sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 17 January 1969.' However, the sailing was delayed so Cunard commissioned a reprint with corrected text reading 'sails on her maiden voyage early in 1969.'\n\n\"Private Packs\" - Over the years, a number of individuals and organisations have produced Private Packs featuring specific Royal Mail stamp issues. Examples of Private Packs include Post Office Missed (also known as POM), Bournemouth and Norwich Packs. Most of these packs are produced by the philatelic departments of national post offices. However, there is nothing to stop anyone from producing a pack by taking a set of stamps and designing their own holder. A number of \"private packs\" have been created in Britain to promote products, events, or simply as souvenirs including British Caledonian Airways for the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977 and Scottish Wildlife Trust for the 1981 British Butterflies stamps. A more recent Private Pack was produced by the National Assembly of Wales in 2006, for distribution to its members. The pack contained a 2006 Celebrating Wales Miniature Sheet and a specially designed information card detailing the history of the Assembly.\n\n"}

They are mainly spoken on Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago between Borneo and Mindanao.\n\nGrimes (2003) identifies nine Sama–Bajaw languages. \n\nThe first six are spoken in the Sulu region of the Southern Philippines. Indonesian Bajaw is spoken mainly in Sulawesi and West Coast Bajaw in Sabah, Borneo. Several dialects of the languages can be identified.\n\nBlust (2006) states that lexical evidence indicates that Sama–Bajaw originated in the Barito region of southeast Borneo, though not from any established group of Barito languages. \"Ethnologue\" has followed, calling the resulting group 'Greater Barito'.\n\nPallesen (1985:18) classifies the Sama-Bajaw languages as follows.\n\n\nWestern Austronesian languages are characterised by symmetrical voice alternations. These diﬀer from asymmetrical voice alternations, such as active and passive, since the voices can be considered equally transitive. Hence, the terms Actor Voice and Undergoer Voice are sometimes used. \nThe voice construction is signalled through morphological marking on the verb.\n\nWestern Austronesian languages are typically subdivided into Philippine-type and Indonesian-type languages on the basis of the voice system:\n\nThe voice alternations in Sama–Bajaw languages have some characteristics of Philippine-type languages and some characteristics of Indonesian-type languages.\n\nMiller (2014) says that there are three main voice alternations in Sama-Bajaw:\nIn many Philippine languages, the UV construction is said to be basic. This has led people to analyse the languages as syntactically ergative. This analysis has been proposed for Sama Southern (Trick 2006); Yakan (Brainard & Behrens 2002); Sama Bangingi’ (Gault 1999) and Sama Pangutaran (Walton 1986). These languages are said to have Philippine-type voice systems.\n\nWest Coast Bajau, however, is said to have an Indonesian-type voice system because there are two transitive voices; a true passive construction (\"-in-\") and an applicative suffix (\"-an\"). This makes West Coast Bajau more similar to the languages of Sarawak and Kalimantan than the other languages of Sabah.\n\nIndonesian Bajau also has an Indonesian-type voice system as illustrated below:\n\nActor Voice\n\nBare Undergoer Voice\n\nPassive\n\nAccidental Passive\n\nIn some Sama-Bajau languages there are restrictions on how the non-AV actor is realised. For example, in Sama Bangingi’ the non-AV actor is typically a pronominal clitic in first or second person.\n\nThe voice alternations in Sama-Bajau languages can also be accompanied by a change in the case-marking of pronouns and a change in word-order.\n\nSama-Bajau languages do not have case-marking on nominal arguments.\n\nNonetheless, pronouns have diﬀerent forms depending on their grammatical function. Like the languages of Sarawak, West Coast Bajau has two different pronoun sets\nIn contrast, most of the languages of Sabah have three sets of pronouns:\nIn West Coast Bajau, the non-subject undergoer can be optionally realised using both the Set 1 and the Set 2 pronouns.\n\nZero anaphora is possible for highly topical arguments, except the UV actor, which cannot be deleted. This is common across Western Austronesian languages.\n\nLike the languages of the Philippines, the Sama–Bajaw languages in the Sulu tend to be verb-initial. However, in most languages word order is flexible and depends on the voice construction. In the Sulu, SVO is only found in the context of preposed negatives and aspect markers. In West Coast Bajau, on the other hand, SVO word-order is also found in pragmatically neutral contexts. This, again, makes West Coast Bajau more similar to the languages of Sarawak, than the other languages of the Sama-Bajaw group.\n\nVerheijen (1986) suggests that the Bajau language spoken in the Lesser Sunda Islands has no fixed position of the subject but is fixed VO. The language has several properties that are said to correlate with VO word-order: \nThe preferred word-orders for five Sama-Bajau languages are shown below. The word order is represented in terms of the semantic roles: actor (A) and undergoer (U).\n\nIn all Sama-Bajau languages, the position of the actor is fixed, directly following the verb in the zero UV construction. Elsewhere, the order of actor and undergoer depends on the animacy of the arguments. This could be seen to follow the Philippine tendency to place actors first in the clause.\n\nIf we rephrase these orders in terms of grammatical function, a number of Sama-Bajau languages could be said to be VOS languages. S is equivalent to the actor in AV and the undergoer in UV. O is equivalent to the non-subject core argument.\n\nVariant word-orders are permitted in Sama-Bajau languages. The different word-orders have different information structure interpretations. This differs depending on the voice of the clause.\n\nMiller (2007) suggests that verb-initial order in West Coast Bajau UV clauses strongly correlates with foregrounding. He argues that this is the basic word order given that the undergoer in final position does not have a specific pragmatic status. In contrast, fronted undergoers are highly active and accessible. Both SVO and VOS orders occur with equal frequency in narrative texts, though VOS is highly preferred in foregrounded clauses.\n\nAV clauses are predominantly subject-initial regardless of grounding. In fact, SVO is the only word-order permitted in subordinate clauses. Where verb-initial clauses in AV do occur, however, they typically represent key sequences of action in the storyline.\n\nThere are also specificity effects in AV verb-initial word order. VOS is acceptable when the non-subject undergoer is non-specific, but sometimes considered unacceptable if the undergoer is specific. The same is true for definite undergoers. However, the effects are not found when the word-order is VSO and the undergoer is in final position. In this case, the structure is grammatical regardless of whether the undergoer is definite/specific or not.\n\nIn West Coast Bajau it is possible for subjects, obliques and adjuncts to appear pre-verbally. Only non-subject arguments cannot appear in this position. Miller (2007: 193) suggests that there are two positions pre-verbally: topic and focus. Topic represents presupposed information whilst focus represents new information. In both AV and UV clauses, the preverbal subjects can be either topic or focus. Obliques, on the other hand, are always focus.\n\nConsequently, Miller (2007: 211) analyses the clause structure of West Coast Bajau as follows:\n\nPragmatic Structure of West Coast Bajau\n\nThe preverbal focus position can be followed by focus particles such as \"no.\"\n\nProto-Sama-Bajaw is reconstructed in Pallesen (1985). Pallesen (1985) considers the homeland of Proto-Sama-Bajaw to be in the Basilan Strait area, around 800 AD.\n\n"}

The word plate is typically omitted in America and carpenters speak simply of the \"sill\". Other names are ground plate, ground sill, groundsel, and midnight sill. Sill plates are usually composed of lumber but can be any material. The timber at the top of a wall is often called a top plate, pole plate, wall plate or simply \"the plate\".\n\nIn historic buildings the sills were almost always large, solid timbers framed together at the corners, carry the bents, and are set on the stone or brick foundation walls, piers, or piles (wood posts driven or set into the ground). The sill typically carries the wall framing (posts and studs) and floor joists.\n\nThere are rare examples of historic buildings in the U.S. where the floor joists land on the foundation and a plank sill or timber sill sit on top of the joists. Another rare, historic building technique is for the posts of a timber frame building to land directly on a foundation or in the ground and the sills fit between the posts and are called \"interrupted sills\".\n\nIn modern, wood construction, sills usually come in sizes of 2×4, 2×6, 2×8, and 2×10. In stick framing, the sill is made of treated lumber, and is anchored to the foundation wall, often with J-bolts, to keep the building from coming off the foundation during a severe storm or earthquake. Building codes require that the bottom of the sill plate be kept 6 to 8 inches above the finished grade, to hinder termites, and to prevent the sill plate from rotting.\n\nIn automobiles, the sill plate is located underneath the door and sometimes displays the make or model of the vehicle.\n\nIn naval architecture, sill also refers to the lower horizontal plate (frame) height, above which doors and access opening are fixed.\n\n\n"}

While the predominant languages of the island are Sinhala and Tamil, the interaction of the Portuguese and the Sri Lankans led to the evolution of a new language, Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole (SLPC), which flourished as a \"lingua franca\" on the island for over 350 years (16th to mid-19th centuries). SLPC continues to be spoken by an unknown, extremely small population. All speakers of SLPC are members of the Burgher community: descendents of the Portuguese and Dutch who founded families in Sri Lanka. Europeans, Eurasians and Burghers account for 0.2% of the Sri Lankan population. Though only a small group of people actually continue to speak SLPC, Portuguese cultural traditions are still in wide practice by many Sri Lankans who are neither of Portuguese descent nor Roman Catholics. SLPC is associated with the Sri Lanka Kaffir people, an ethnic minority group. SLPC has been considered the most important creole dialect in Asia because of its vitality and the influence of its vocabulary on the Sinhalese language. Lexical borrowing from Portuguese can be observed in many areas of the Sinhalese language. Portuguese influence has been so deeply absorbed into daily Sri Lankan life and behavior that these traditions will likely continue into perpetuity.\n\nIn 1517, the Portuguese, attracted by the island's spices and strategic position (midway between their holdings on the west coast of India and Malacca), sent an expedition from Goa to establish a trading post at Colombo. They introduced Christianity to the island, and granted special favors to those who converted. Using the unstable political situation on the island to their advantage, the Portuguese soon gained the position of guardians of the nominal monarch of southern Sri Lanka. In 1557, Dharmapala, who was the king at Kotte, near Colombo, and had suzerainty over Kandy and Jaffna (the other two kingdoms) was baptized Dom João Dharmapala breaking a 1,850-year-old tradition as a Christian king sat on the Sinhalese throne. Several Sri Lankan aristocrats and others followed the King and converted. In 1597, Dharmapala, the last king of the Kotte, died childless, and willed his realm to Philip I, king of Portugal. In 1617, with the annexation of Jaffna, Portuguese authority extended over the entire lowland zone. Catholicism continued to spread, but the Portuguese did not train an indigenous clergy, so it was simply a microcosm of the church in Portugal.\n\nThe Dutch were in contact with the Kandyan court as early as 1602, but it wasn't until 1632 that the Kandyan monarch, Raja Sinha II, invited Dutch cooperation in expelling the Portuguese from the island. A long period of conflict ensued, including the Dutch takeover of Batticaloa in 1638, and ending with the fall of Mannar and Jaffna in 1658. When Raja Sinha II realized that the Dutch were not about to deliver their new conquests to him, the alliance quickly dissolved into enmity. The Dutch East India Company was primarily interested in commercial profits and resisted engaging in costly military operations against Kandy. During the Dutch reign, 1761–1766, was the only period of outright war. The Dutch also maltreated the Catholics and forced conversions to the Calvinist faith, the Catholic Church fell to its foundations as Catholic marriages, practice of the faith, and priests were forbidden by the Dutch. Catholics met secretly at each other's homes to practice their faith. At this time, the Catholic Church may have disappeared completely in Sri Lanka had it not been for the work of Goan priests who came to the island to save Catholicism.\n\nThe Portuguese reached India in 1498, before coming to Sri Lanka in 1505. By that time a distinct pidgin of Portuguese had probably begun to develop, and this was used as the basis for communication with the new territory’s inhabitants. There is very little documented evidence of the linguistic situation at the time, however, it is clear that by the early 17th century a Portuguese-based pidgin was in use in the Portuguese controlled littoral, and was not unknown in the kingdom of Kandy because of its frequent dealings with outsiders. Also, a creole community had been established consisting of two groups or creole speakers: the Topazes (Tupasses, mestiços, etc.), \"dark-skinned or half-cast people claiming Portuguese descent, and Christian profession, and Kaffirs (Caffres, etc.), or Bantus\".\n\nThe Topazes were children of local or half-caste mothers and Portuguese or half-caste fathers. They would have been exposed to pidgin/creole Portuguese at home. They identified with Portuguese, a natural occurrence, considering that the Portuguese were at the apex of the social order, though they probably had local family ties as well. The Portuguese brought Bantu slaves (Kaffirs) to Sri Lanka from the eastern African Great Lakes region. These people would have spoken pidgin Portuguese, and it is likely that many were native creole speakers, but maybe not of the Sri Lanka variety. Because they mainly served as domestic servants, they would have introduced the very young children of Casados (married men who had come with their Portuguese wives as settlers to Sri Lanka) to the pidgin/creole. There may have also been children of chance unions of Portuguese or Topazes with Kaffirs, but it is unclear which group they would have belonged to.\n\nSri Lanka was a Dutch colony from 1658 to 1796. During this time there was Dutch influence on the language, and possibly the development of a Portuguese–Dutch Creole. There may still be a few speakers of this in Wattala, a suburb of Colombo. However, the majority of Dutch Burghers spoke Dutch, Portuguese, English, or Portuguese Creole.\n\nToday, the language is spoken by descendants of Topazes and Casados, the Portuguese Burgher community, in the Eastern towns of Batticaloa (Koolavaddy, Mamangam, Uppodai, Dutch Bar, Akkaraipattu) and Trincomalee (Palayuttu). However, there are also speakers among the Kaffirs, descendants of Bantu slaves, in the Northwestern province, in Puttalam and in Mannar. Additionally, in the village of Wahakotte near Galewala, in central Sri Lanka, there is a small community of Catholics with partial Portuguese ancestry, where the language was spoken until two generations ago.\n\nBatticaloa is a medium-sized coastal town in the Eastern Province that has always been an isolated outpost, and has been able to retain many ancient habits. This isolation has been a factor in the preservation of SLPC, but very little information exists about the town’s history. Tamil speakers are the overwhelming majority, but there is also a concentrated community of SLPC speaking Burghers. In the early part of the century most Burghers lived close to the center of the town, but more recently, many have moved to outlying areas. All of the Burghers in Batticaloa speak Tamil, many of them better than they do SLPC, and some also speak Sinhala and/or English. The group has no contact with any other creole speakers on the island, and the creole has for a long time been losing ground to Tamil. Currently, decreasing competence can be observed over successive generations: the younger a Burgher, the less likely they are to know the creole, and if they can speak it, their speech exhibits more Tamil features than that of their parents. Members of the burgher community are in constant interaction with Tamil speakers as they live, work, play, study, and worship together. Burgher children learn Tamil at the same time that they learn the creole. It is difficult to determine how many of Batticaloa’s Burghers speak SLPC, but most probably understand it, though in many homes Tamil has become the predominant language.\n\nThe language is facing extinction, as it is now only used at home and few are able to speak it well. Throughout Sri Lanka many SLPC speakers have emigrated to other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States and Europe. There are still 100 Burgher families in Batticaloa and Trincomalee and 80 Kaffir families in Puttalam that speak the language. SLPC was very prominent in the past, continuing to be in use despite predictions that it would die out, but current prospects for its survival are equally as bleak as in the past.\n\nAn early sample of the language was collected by Hugh Nevill, a British civil servant stationed in Sri Lanka in the late 19th century. Among his large collection of oriental manuscripts is the \"Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole Manuscript\", containing over a thousand verses and a long text in prose.\n\nPrecise phonological knowledge of the Sri Lankan Portuguese Creole (SLPC) is limited. The earliest analysis of the language comes from the 19th and early 20th centuries, but since the research was based purely on written data, it lacks insight on how speech was actually produced. The only complete study that includes phonological analysis of native speakers seems to be Ian R Smith’s thesis which was published in 1978. His research surveyed the Creole-speaking people living in the Batticaloa area of Sri Lanka. It can be assumed, unless otherwise indicated, that the phonological information about SLPC in the section on vowels and consonants is solely from his thesis, due to the lack of similar resources of a precise nature.\n\nVowels\nStandard Portuguese (SP) has rich vowel phonology with seven to nine oral vowels (depending on which dialect), five nasal vowels, ten oral diphthongs and five nasal diphthongs. While SLPC has retained the same oral vowels found in Standard Continental Portuguese, it does not make the distinction between nasalized and non-nasalized vowels. While the vowels are derived from Portuguese, the vowel features appear more similar to Tamil, since in both Tamil and the Creole vowels are distinguished by length. \nWord internal sequences of two vowels do not occur in SLPC, therefore the creole does not appear to have diphthongs as there are in SP. Again, vowel lengthening seems to take place instead of diphthongization.\n\nChart A shows a vowel chart for SP, where nasality is distinguished from oral vowels, and a vowel chart for SLPC, where vowel length is a distinctive feature. Chart (B) shows both long vowels (such as the word for ‘wax’, , from BrP ‘cerar’) and short vowels (such as in the word for ‘want’, , from BrP ‘querer’).\n\nBesides the distinction between vowel length and vowel nasality, the place of stress on vowels distinguishes SP and SLPC. Both Batticaloan Tamil and the SLPC have entirely predictable stress² patterns whereas SP does not. While stress is predictable, it is not simply a surface phenomenon, so it must be represented lexically. \nA few rules about stress in SLPC:\n1. Either short or long vowels can take on stress, but long vowels always carry stress. \n2. A word can contain only one phonetically long vowel, but numerous unstressed short vowels. \n3. Short vowels can be stressed only when found in initial syllables.\n4. Stress falls on the last underlying long vowel of a word, or on the first vowel of a word having no long vowel.\nStress is important as it relates to the phonological changes that occur in the Creole. For instance, there is [vowel reduction] by way of prominence reduction of unstressed vowels. This means that relatively long vowels in an unstressed position are replaced by shorter vowels of a similar quality.⁶ :So, as a general rule, low and mid-vowels are contrastive under stress in SLPC, but neutralized and given the features of a mid-vowel when not stressed. Another way to say this is that through a pattern of neutralization, high [sonority] vowels are eliminated in SLPC. The pattern of vowel reduction is shown in Table (1) below:\n\nOther phonological processes vowels of SLPC demonstrate are epenthesis and elision. Neither is a very common phenomena, however, so they will only be dealt with briefly. The insertion of epenthetic occurs to prevent the formation of certain consonant clusters that are atypical. One example of this is seen when the verb ‘to judge’ or , is nominalized. This is done by the suffix , which requires an epenthetic when added to the stem , because the potentially resulting consonant cluster of does not regularly occur in the language. Therefore the combination of the stem, the epenthetic and the suffix yields the form , where the is inserted in-between the and the .\nSince word medial sequences of two or more vowels do not occur in Sri Lanka, as mentioned earlier, a process of vowel elision and glide epenthesis can co-occur to prevent vowels from coming together. Firstly, when there exists a possible combination of two vowels as result of some sort of word construction a glide separates them. Secondly, as a result of this the first vowel of the two may be reduced or elided.\nA) Standard Portuguese\n\nB)Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole\n\nConsonants\nSLPC uses several manners of consonant articulation which are not found in SP. Since this Creole do does express influence from Batticaloa Tamil, English, and Dutch (particularly via loan words.) It is difficult to determine where some of these segments have been loaned from. For instance, the closed front rounded vowel is considered a glide in SLPC and does not behave this way in Tamil or Portuguese. It seems to have evolved for the high front vowel \n\nAs mentioned earlier, SLPC seems to have an affinity for gemination of vowels resulting in a distinction between short and long vowels. As for consonants, there is also a tendency to geminate all voiceless consonants after a short stressed vowel. However, all tense consonants can optionally become geminate. For instance, in the word (lock), the can become stressed and geminate, to achieve the pronunciation . Similarly, word (bag) can become which can be achieved by the simple rule:\ncodice_1.\n\nSri Lankan Portuguese Creole\nStandard Portuguese\n\nLike many [[Creole language|creoles]], SLPC is made up of [[lexical item]]s from an array of different sources. There is, of course, much influence from the [[indigenous languages]] like Tamil and Sinhala. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] had a vast impact on this creole, and there are also traces of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and English. It was also most likely influenced by other creoles and varieties of [[Indo-Portuguese]], as the island was visited frequently by traders from [[Goa]] and other Portuguese settlements like [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], and [[Diu, India|Diu]]. The similarities with other Indo-Portuguese creoles may also be, however, due to similar circumstances and traits of the languages from which they stem. There is also some [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] influences and loan words.\n\nExample of Portuguese origin words (traced back to Latin origin)\n\n-nariz = nose - Portuguese nariz\n-besos =lips - Portuguese beiços (lips)\n-kum = with - Portuguese com\n¬-hum(a) = ‘one,’ ‘a/an’ Portuguese um(a)\n-sumana = week - Portuguese semana\n-mael = honey -Portuguese mel\nExample of Portuguese origin words\n-meo = middle -Portuguese meio\n-cam = ground, floor -Portuguese chão\n-almuça = breakfast -Portuguese almoço (lunch)\n-fome = hunger -Portuguese fome\n-basu ¬= low -Portuguese baixo\nExample of Dutch origin words\n-krel = curl -Dutch krul\n-rol = roll -Dutch rollen\n-gorgel = throat -Dutch gorgel\n-ruvin = ruin -Dutch ruïne (ruin) Portuguese ruína (ruin)\n\nExample of Tamil/ Sinhala origin words \n-pepiya = speak -Tamil pepiya \n-podiyas = children -Sinhala podi (small) -Batticaloa Tamil potiyan (small boy) \n-nona = lady -Sinhala nona from Portuguese dona (lady)\n-sarayatiya = walking stick -Sinhala sarayatiya\n\nThe normal sentence structure of standard Portuguese (SP) is subject verb object (SVO). In Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole (SLPC), SVO dominates, but SOV and OSV also occur. The syntax structure is similar to that of Tamil. For example, the verb has been reduced to a single form, and tense-mood-aspect markers (lo, te, ja) indicate the future, present and past tenses; that is, lo leva (SLPC): levarae (SP) 'he will carry'; te folga (SLPC): folgam (SP) 'they rejoice'; ja olha (SLPC): olhei (SP) 'I saw.' (see ‘phrase samples’ below) \n\nAlso, ‘se’ the conditional marker, comes at the end of the utterance like in:\n\"ja pepiya se\"                   \"nosse jentis dos pesam tinhe se\"\n‘if [they] speak.’                  ‘if two of our people are [there].’\n\nIn standard Portuguese, the conditional marker ‘se’ usually comes at the beginning of the utterance:\n\"se eu vou contigo, eu vou dirigir.             se soubesse do bem que me faz!\"\n“if I go with you, I will drive.”             “if [he/she] knew the good it does me!”\nPhrase Samples:\n\"Que vosse lo* tem diziado per acha?\" “what will you please to have?”\n\"Tem aquel verdade?\" “Is it true?”\n\"Ala nontem asiilei cousa.\" “There is no such thing.”\n\"Eu nihumtempo novo ouvi aquel.\" “I have never heard of it.”\n\"Vosse que te* avisa parmi per fai?\" “What do you advise me to do?”\n\"Huma nonpode ouvi otro huma que papia.\" “One cannot hear another speak”\n\"Vosse quanto vez ja* caza?\" “How many times have you married?”\n\n\n[[Category:Portuguese-based pidgins and creoles]]\n[[Category:Languages of Sri Lanka|Indo-Portuguese]]\n[[Category:Portuguese diaspora in Asia]]\n[[Category:Dutch-based pidgins and creoles]]\n[[Category:Dutch Ceylon]]\n\n[[nl:Ceylons-Nederlands]]"}

{"id": "29054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29054", "title": "Syntactic sugar", "text": "Syntactic sugar\n\nIn computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language \"sweeter\" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.\n\nFor example, many programming languages provide special syntax for referencing and updating array elements. Abstractly, an array reference is a procedure of two arguments: an array and a subscript vector, which could be expressed as codice_1. Instead, many languages provide syntax like codice_2. Similarly an array element update is a procedure of three arguments, something like codice_3, but many languages provide syntax like codice_4.\n\nA construct in a language is called \"syntactic sugar\" if it can be removed from the language without any effect on what the language can do: functionality and expressive power will remain the same.\n\nLanguage processors, including compilers, static analyzers, and the like, often expand sugared constructs into more fundamental constructs before processing, a process sometimes called \"desugaring\".\n\nThe term \"syntactic sugar\" was coined by Peter J. Landin in 1964 to describe the surface syntax of a simple ALGOL-like programming language which was defined semantically in terms of the applicative expressions of lambda calculus, centered on lexically replacing λ with \"where\".\n\nLater programming languages, such as CLU, ML and Scheme, extended the term to refer to syntax within a language which could be defined in terms of a language core of essential constructs; the convenient, higher-level features could be \"desugared\" and decomposed into that subset. This is, in fact, the usual mathematical practice of building up from primitives.\n\nBuilding on Landin's distinction between essential language constructs and syntactic sugar, in 1991, Matthias Felleisen proposed a codification of \"expressive power\" to align with \"widely held beliefs\" in the literature. He defined \"more expressive\" to mean that without the language constructs in question, a program would have to be completely reorganized.\n\n\nSome programmers feel that these syntax usability features are either unimportant or outright frivolous. Notably, special syntactic forms make a language less uniform and its specification more complex, and may cause problems as programs become large and complex. This view is particularly widespread in the Lisp community, as Lisp has very simple and regular syntax, and the surface syntax can easily be modified.\nFor example, Alan Perlis once quipped in \"Epigrams on Programming\", in a reference to bracket-delimited languages, that \"Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semi-colons\".\n\nThe metaphor has been extended by coining the term \"syntactic salt\", which indicates a feature designed to make it harder to write bad code. Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop that programmers must jump through just to prove that they know what is going on, rather than to express a program action. For example, in Java and Pascal assigning a float value to a variable declared as an int without additional syntax explicitly stating that intention will result in a compile error, while C and C++ will automatically truncate any floats assigned to an int. However this is not syntax, but semantics.\n\nIn C#, when hiding an inherited class member, a compiler warning is issued unless the codice_23 keyword is used to specify that the hiding is intentional. To avoid potential bugs owing to the similarity of the switch statement syntax with that of C or C++, C# requires a codice_24 for each non-empty codice_25 label of a codice_26 (unless codice_27, codice_28, or codice_29 is used) even though it does not allow implicit \"fall-through\". (Using codice_27 and specifying the subsequent label produces a C/C++-like \"fall-through\".)\n\nSyntactic salt may defeat its purpose by making the code unreadable and thus worsen its quality – in extreme cases, the essential part of the code may be shorter than the overhead introduced to satisfy language requirements.\n\nAn alternative to syntactic salt is generating compiler warnings when there is high probability that the code is a result of a mistake – a practice common in modern C/C++ compilers.\n\nOther extensions are \"syntactic saccharin\" and \"syntactic syrup\", meaning gratuitous syntax that does not make programming any easier.\n\n"}

{"id": "39573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39573", "title": "Tone (linguistics)", "text": "Tone (linguistics)\n\nTone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning – that is, to distinguish or to inflect words. All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey emphasis, contrast, and other such features in what is called intonation, but not all languages use tones to distinguish words or their inflections, analogously to consonants and vowels. Languages that do have this feature are called tonal languages; the distinctive tone patterns of such a language are sometimes called tonemes, by analogy with \"phoneme\". Tonal languages are common in East and Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Africa, and the Americas; as many as seventy percent of world languages may be tonal.\n\nIn many tonal African languages, such as most Bantu languages, tones are distinguished by their pitch level relative to each other, known as a register tone system. In multisyllable words, a single tone may be carried by the entire word rather than a different tone on each syllable. Often, grammatical information, such as past versus present, \"I\" versus \"you\", or positive versus negative, is conveyed solely by tone.\n\nIn the most widely spoken tonal language, Mandarin Chinese, tones are distinguished by their distinctive shape, known as contour, with each tone having a different internal pattern of rising and falling pitch. Many words, especially monosyllabic ones, are differentiated solely by tone. In a multisyllabic word, each syllable often carries its own tone. Unlike in Bantu systems, tone plays little role in the grammar of modern standard Chinese, though the tones descend from features in Old Chinese that had morphological significance (such as changing a verb to a noun or vice versa).\n\nContour systems are typical of languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, including Kra–Dai, Vietic and Sino-Tibetan languages. The Afroasiatic, Khoisan, Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages spoken in Africa are dominated by register systems. Some languages combine both systems, such as Cantonese, which produces three varieties of contour tone at three different pitch levels, and the Omotic (Afroasiatic) language Bench, which employs five level tones and one or two rising tones across levels.\n\nMany languages use tone in a more limited way. In Japanese, fewer than half of the words have a drop in pitch; words contrast according to which syllable this drop follows. Such minimal systems are sometimes called pitch accent since they are reminiscent of stress accent languages, which typically allow one principal stressed syllable per word. However, there is debate over the definition of pitch accent and whether a coherent definition is even possible.\n\nMost languages of Sub-Saharan Africa are members of the Niger-Congo family, which is predominantly tonal; notably excepting Swahili (in the Southeast), most languages spoken in the Senegambia (among them Wolof, Serer and Cangin languages), Koyra Chiini and Fulani. The Afroasiatic languages include both tonal (Chadic, Omotic) and nontonal (Semitic, Berber, Egyptian, and most Cushitic) branches. All three Khoisan language families: Khoe, Kx'a and Tuu, are tonal.\n\nNumerous tonal languages are widely spoken in China and Mainland Southeast Asia. Sino-Tibetan and Tai-Kadai languages are mostly tonal, including Thai, Lao, all the varieties of Chinese (though some, such as Shanghainese, are only marginally tonal) and Burmese with few exceptions such as Amdo Tibetan. The Hmong–Mien languages are some of the most tonal languages in the world, with as many as twelve phonemically distinct tones. Austroasiatic (such as Khmer and Mon) and Austronesian (such as Malay) languages are mostly non tonal with the rare exception of Austroasiatic languages like Vietnamese, and Austronesian languages like Cèmuhî and Utsul. Tones in Vietnamese and Utsul may result from heavy Chinese influence on both languages. There were tones in Middle Korean. Other languages represented in the region, such as Mongolian, Uyghur, and Japanese belong to language families that do not contain any tonality as defined here. In South Asia, many Indo-Aryan languages have tonality, including many languages from the Northwest zone, like Punjabi, Dogri, and Lahndaand many Bengali-Assamese languages such as Sylheti, Rohingya, Chittagonian and Chakma.\n\nIn Europe, Indo-European languages such as Swedish, Norwegian, Limburgish and Scots (Germanic languages), Serbo-Croatian and Slovene (Slavic languages), Lithuanian and Latvian (Baltic languages), have tonal characteristics.\n\nAlthough the Austronesian language family has some tonal members such as New Caledonia's Cèmuhî language, no tonal languages have been discovered in Australia. Tone is also present in many Papuan languages.\n\nA large number of North, South and Central American languages are tonal, including many of the Athabaskan languages of Alaska and the American Southwest (including Navajo), and the Oto-Manguean languages of Mexico. Among the Mayan languages, which are mostly non-tonal, Yucatec (with the largest number of speakers), Uspantek, and one dialect of Tzotzil have developed tone systems. However, although tone systems have been recorded for many American languages, little theoretical work has been completed for the characterization of their tone systems. In different cases, Oto-Manguean tone languages in Mexico have been found to possess tone systems similar to both Asian and African tone languages.\n\nLanguages that are tonal include:\n\nIn some cases it is difficult to determine whether a language is tonal. For example, the Ket language has been described as having up to eight tones by some investigators, as having four tones by others, but by some as having no tone at all. In cases such as these, the classification of a language as tonal may depend on the researcher's interpretation of what tone is. For instance, the Burmese language has phonetic tone, but each of its three tones is accompanied by a distinctive phonation (creaky, murmured or plain vowels). It could be argued either that the tone is incidental to the phonation, in which case Burmese would not be phonemically tonal, or that the phonation is incidental to the tone, in which case it would be considered tonal. Something similar appears to be the case with Ket.\n\nThe 19th-century constructed language Solresol can consist of only tone, although, unlike all natural tonal languages, Solresol's tone is absolute rather than relative and no tone sandhi occurs.\n\nMost languages use pitch as intonation to convey prosody and pragmatics, but this does not make them tonal languages. In tonal languages, each syllable has an inherent pitch contour, and thus minimal pairs (or larger minimal sets) exist between syllables with the same segmental features (consonants and vowels) but different tones.\n\nHere is a minimal tone set from Mandarin Chinese, which has five tones, here transcribed by diacritics over the vowels:\n\n\nThese tones combine with a syllable such as \"ma\" to produce different words. A minimal set based on \"ma\" are, in pinyin transcription,\n\nThese may be combined into the rather contrived sentence,\n\nA well-known tongue-twister in Standard Thai is:\n\nVietnamese has its version:\n\nCantonese has its version:\n\nTone is most frequently manifested on vowels, but in most tonal languages where voiced syllabic consonants occur they will bear tone as well. This is especially common with syllabic nasals, for example in many Bantu and Kru languages, but also occurs in Serbo-Croatian. It is also possible for lexically contrastive pitch (or tone) to span entire words or morphemes instead of manifesting on the syllable nucleus (vowels), which is the case in Punjabi.\n\nTones can interact in complex ways through a process known as tone sandhi.\n\nBoth lexical or grammatical tone and prosodic intonation are cued by changes in pitch, as well sometimes by changes in phonation. Lexical tone coexists with intonation, with the lexical changes of pitch like waves superimposed on larger swells. For example, Luksaneeyanawin (1993) describes three intonational patterns in Thai: falling (with semantics of \"finality, closedness and definiteness\"), rising (\"non-finality, openness and non-definiteness\") and \"convoluted\" (contrariness, conflict and emphasis). The phonetic realization of these intonational patterns superimposed on the five lexical tones of Thai (in citation form) are as follows:\n\nWith convoluted intonation, it appears that high and falling tone conflate, while the low tone with convoluted intonation has the same contour as rising tone with falling intonation.\n\nTone systems fall into two broad patterns, according to whether contour tones exist.\n\nMost varieties of Chinese use contour tone systems, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (that is, the pitch is a contour), such as rising, falling, dipping, or level. Most Bantu languages, on the other hand, have non-contour tone (or \"register tone\") systems where the distinguishing feature is the relative difference between the pitches, such as high, mid, or low, rather than their shapes. In such systems there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine relative-pitch and contour tones, such as many Kru languages, where nouns are distinguished by contour tones and verbs by pitch. Others, such as Yoruba, have phonetic contours, but these can easily be analysed as sequences of single-pitch tones, with for example sequences of high–low becoming falling , and sequences of low–high becoming rising .\n\nFalling tones tend to fall further than rising tones rise; high–low tones are common, whereas low–high tones are quite rare. A language with contour tones will also generally have as many or more falling tones than rising tones. However, exceptions are not unheard of; Mpi, for example, has three level and three rising tones, but no falling tones.\n\nIn a number of East Asian languages, tonal differences are closely intertwined with phonation differences. In Vietnamese, for example, the \"ngã\" and \"sắc\" tones are both high-rising but the former is distinguished by having glottalization in the middle. Similarly, the \"nặng\" and \"huyền\" tones are both low-falling, but the \"nặng\" tone is shorter and pronounced with creaky voice at the end, while the \"huyền\" tone is longer and often has breathy voice. In some languages, such as Burmese, pitch and phonation are so closely intertwined that the two are combined in a single phonological system, where neither can be considered without the other. The distinctions of such systems are termed \"registers\", not to be confused with \"register tones\" described above.\n\nTones are realized as pitch only in a relative sense. \"High tone\" and \"low tone\" are only meaningful relative to the speaker's vocal range and in comparing one syllable to the next, rather than as a contrast of absolute pitch such as one finds in music. As a result, when one combines tone with sentence prosody, the absolute pitch of a high tone at the end of a prosodic unit may be lower than that of a low tone at the beginning of the unit, because of the universal tendency (in both tonal and non-tonal languages) for pitch to decrease with time in a process called downdrift.\n\nTones may affect each other just as consonants and vowels do. In many register-tone languages, low tones may cause a downstep in following high or mid tones; the effect is such that even while the low tones remain at the lower end of the speaker's vocal range (which is itself descending due to downdrift), the high tones drop incrementally like steps in a stairway or terraced rice fields, until finally the tones merge and the system has to be reset. This effect is called tone terracing.\n\nSometimes a tone may remain as the sole realization of a grammatical particle after the original consonant and vowel disappear, so it can only be heard by its effect on other tones. It may cause downstep, or it may combine with other tones to form contours. These are called floating tones.\n\nIn many contour-tone languages, one tone may affect the shape of an adjacent tone. The affected tone may become something new, a tone that only occurs in such situations, or it may be changed into a different existing tone. This is called tone sandhi. In Mandarin Chinese, for example, a dipping tone between two other tones is reduced to a simple low tone, which otherwise does not occur in Mandarin Chinese, whereas if two dipping tones occur in a row, the first becomes a rising tone, indistinguishable from other rising tones in the language. For example, the words 很 ('very') and 好 ('good') produce the phrase 很好 ('very good').\n\nAnother difference between tonal languages is whether the tones apply independently to each syllable or to the word as a whole. In Cantonese, Thai, and to some extent the Kru languages, each syllable may have a tone, whereas in Shanghainese, the Scandinavian languages, and many Bantu languages, the contour of each tone operates at the word level. That is, a trisyllabic word in a three-tone syllable-tone language has many more tonal possibilities (3 × 3 × 3 = 27) than a monosyllabic word (3), but there is no such difference in a word-tone language. For example, Shanghainese has two contrastive (phonemic) tones no matter how many syllables are in a word. Many languages described as having pitch accent are word-tone languages.\n\nTone sandhi is an intermediate situation, as tones are carried by individual syllables, but affect each other so that they are not independent of each other. For example, a number of Mandarin Chinese suffixes and grammatical particles have what is called (when describing Mandarin Chinese) a \"neutral\" tone, which has no independent existence. If a syllable with a neutral tone is added to a syllable with a full tone, the pitch contour of the resulting word is entirely determined by that other syllable:\n\nAfter high level and high rising tones, the neutral syllable has an independent pitch that looks like a mid-register tonethe default tone in most register-tone languages. However, after a falling tone it takes on a low pitch; the contour tone remains on the first syllable, but the pitch of the second syllable matches where the contour leaves off. And after a low-dipping tone, the contour spreads to the second syllable: the contour remains the same () whether the word has one syllable or two. In other words, the tone is now the property of the word, not the syllable. Shanghainese has taken this pattern to its extreme, as the pitches of all syllables are determined by the tone before them, so that only the tone of the initial syllable of a word is distinctive.\n\nLanguages with simple tone systems or pitch accent may have one or two syllables specified for tone, with the rest of the word taking a default tone. Such languages differ in which tone is marked and which is the default. In Navajo, for example, syllables have a low tone by default, whereas marked syllables have high tone. In the related language Sekani, however, the default is high tone, and marked syllables have low tone. There are parallels with stress: English stressed syllables have a higher pitch than unstressed syllables, whereas in Russian, stressed syllables have a lower pitch.\n\nIn East Asia, tone is typically lexical. This is characteristic of heavily tonal languages such as Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Hmong. That is, tone is used to distinguish words which would otherwise be homonyms, rather than in the grammar, but some Yue Chinese dialects have minimal grammatical use of tone.\n\nHowever, in many African languages, especially in the Niger–Congo family, tone is crucial to the grammar, with relatively little lexical use. In the Kru languages, a combination of these patterns is found: nouns tend to have complex tone systems reminiscent of East Asia but are not much affected by grammatical inflections whereas verbs tend to have simple tone systems of the type more typical of Africa, which are inflected to indicate tense and mood, person, and polarity, so that tone may be the only distinguishing feature between \"you went\" and \"I won't go\".\n\nIn colloquial Yoruba, especially when spoken quickly, vowels may assimilate to each other, and consonants elide so much of the lexical and grammatical information is carried by tone. In languages of West Africa such as Yoruba, people may even communicate with so-called \"talking drums\", which are modulated to imitate the tones of the language, or by whistling the tones of speech.\n\nNote that tonal languages are not distributed evenly across the same range as non-tonal languages. Instead, the majority of tone languages belong to the Niger-Congo, Sino-Tibetan and Vietic groups, which are then composed by a large majority of tone languages and dominate a single region. Only in limited locations (South Africa, New Guinea, Mexico, Brazil and a few others) are tone languages occurring as individual members or small clusters within a non-tone dominated area. In some locations, like Central America, it may represent no more than an incidental effect of which languages were included when one examines the distribution; for groups like Khoi-San in Southern Africa and Papuan languages, whole families of languages possess tonality but simply have relatively few members, and for some North American tone languages, multiple independent origins are suspected.\n\nIf generally considering only complex-tone vs. no-tone, it might be concluded that tone is almost always an ancient feature within a language family that is highly conserved among members. However, when considered in addition to \"simple\" tone systems that include only two tones, tone, as a whole, appears to be more labile, appearing several times within Indo-European languages, several times in American languages, and several times in Papuan families. That may indicate that rather than a trait unique to some language families, tone is a latent feature of most language families that may more easily arise and disappear as languages change over time.\n\nA 2015 study by Caleb Everett argued that tonal languages are more common in hot and humid climates, which make them easier to pronounce, even when considering familial relationships. This is perhaps the first known case of influence of the environment on the structure of the languages spoken in it.\n\nThere are three main approaches to notating tones in phonetic descriptions of a language.\n\nVery rarely, a tone letter consists of more than three elements (peaking or dipping tones), but occasionally, double-peaking or double-dipping tones are encountered. Reversed tone letters may be used for tone sandhi, and dot-plus-bar tone letters for neutral tones.\n\nIn African linguistics (as well as in many African orthographies), a set of diacritics is usual to mark tone. The most common are a subset of the International Phonetic Alphabet:\nSeveral variations are found. In many three-tone languages, it is common to mark high and Low tone as indicated above but to omit marking of the mid tone: \"má\" (high), \"ma\" (mid), \"mà\" (low). Similarly, in some two-tone languages, only one tone is marked explicitly, usually the less common one.\n\nWith more complex tonal systems, such as in the Kru and Omotic languages, it is usual to indicate tone with numbers, with 1 for high and 4 or 5 for low in Kru, but 1 for low and 5 for high in Omotic. Contour tones are then indicated 14, 21, etc.\n\nIn the Chinese tradition, numerals are assigned to various tones (see tone number). For instance, Standard Mandarin Chinese, the official language of China, has four lexically contrastive tones, and the numerals 1, 2, 3, and 4 are assigned to four tones. Syllables can sometimes be toneless and are described as having a neutral tone, typically indicated by omitting tone markings. Chinese varieties are traditionally described in terms of four tonal categories \"ping\" ('level'), \"shang\" ('rising'), \"qu\" ('exiting'), \"ru\" ('entering'), based on the traditional analysis of Middle Chinese (see Four tones); note that these are not at all the same as the four tones of modern standard Mandarin Chinese. Depending on the dialect, each of these categories may then be divided into two tones, typically called \"yin\" and \"yang.\" Typically, syllables carrying the \"ru\" tones are closed by voiceless stops in Chinese varieties that have such coda(s) so in such dialects, \"ru\" is not a tonal category in the sense used by Western linguistics but rather a category of syllable structures. Chinese phonologists perceived these checked syllables as having concomitant short tones, justifying them as a tonal category. In Middle Chinese, when the tonal categories were established, the \"shang\" and \"qu\" tones also had characteristic final obstruents with concomitant tonic differences whereas syllables bearing the \"ping\" tone ended in a simple sonorant. An alternative to using the Chinese category names is assigning to each category a numeral ranging from 1 to 8, sometimes higher for some Southern Chinese dialects with additional tone splits. Syllables belonging to the same tone category differ drastically in actual phonetic tone across the varieties of Chinese even among dialects of the same group. For example, the \"yin ping\" tone is a high level tone in Beijing Mandarin Chinese but a low level tone in Tianjin Mandarin Chinese.\n\nMore iconic systems use tone numbers or an equivalent set of graphic pictograms known as \"Chao tone letters.\" These divide the pitch into five levels, with the lowest being assigned the value 1 and the highest the value 5. (This is the opposite of equivalent systems in Africa and the Americas.) The variation in pitch of a tone contour is notated as a string of two or three numbers. For instance, the four Mandarin Chinese tones are transcribed as follows (note that the tone letters will not display properly without a compatible font installed):\nA mid-level tone would be indicated by /33/, a low level tone /11/, etc. The doubling of the number is commonly used with level tones to distinguish them from tone numbers; tone 3 in Mandarin Chinese, for example, is not mid /3/. However, it is not necessary with tone letters, so /33/ = simple .\n\nIPA diacritic notation is also sometimes seen for Chinese. One reason it is not more widespread is that only two contour tones, rising and falling , are widely supported by IPA fonts while several Chinese varieties have more than one rising or falling tone. One common workaround is to retain standard IPA and for high-rising (/35/) and high-falling (/53/) tones and to use the subscript diacritics and for low-rising (/13/) and low-falling (/31/) tones.\n\nHangul included tone marks for Middle Korean tones. However, Gyeongsang Dialect Korean, which is used in Southeastern regions of South Korea, are known to have a strong influence coming from tones.\n\nStandard Central Thai has five tones–mid, low, falling, high and rising–often indicated respectively by the numbers zero, one, two, three and four. The Thai written script is an alphasyllabary, which specifies the tone unambiguously. Tone is indicated by an interaction of the initial consonant of a syllable, the vowel length, the final consonant (if present), and sometimes a tone mark. A particular tone mark may denote different tones depending on the initial consonant.\n\nVietnamese uses the Latin alphabet, and the six tones are marked by diacritics above or below a certain vowel of each syllable. In many words that end in diphthongs, however, the vowel marked depends on the writer's style. Notation for Vietnamese tones are as follows:\n\nThe Latin-based Hmong and Iu Mien alphabets use full letters for tones. In Hmong, one of the eight tones (the tone) is left unwritten while the other seven are indicated by the letters \"b, m, d, j, v, s, g\" at the end of the syllable. Since Hmong has no phonemic syllable-final consonants, there is no ambiguity. That system enables Hmong speakers to type their language with an ordinary Latin-letter keyboard without having to resort to diacritics. In the Iu Mien, the letters \"v, c, h, x, z\" indicate tones but unlike Hmong, it also has final consonants written before the tone.\n\nSeveral North American languages have tone, one of which is Cherokee, an Iroquoian language. Oklahoma Cherokee has six tones (1 low, 2 medium, 3 high, 4 very high, 5 rising and 6 falling).\n\nIn Mesoamericanist linguistics, /1/ stands for high tone and /5/ stands for low tone, except in Oto-Manguean languages for which /1/ may be low tone and /3/ high tone. It is also common to see acute accents for high tone and grave accents for low tone and combinations of these for contour tones. Several popular orthographies use or after a vowel to indicate low tone.\nSouthern Athabascan languages that include the Navajo and Apache languages are tonal, and are analyzed as having two tones: high and low. One variety of Hopi has developed tone, as has the Cheyenne language.\n\nThe Mesoamerican language stock called Oto-Manguean is famously tonal and is the largest language family in Mesoamerica, containing languages including Zapotec, Mixtec, and Otomí, some of which have as many as five register tones (Trique, Usila Chinantec) and others only two (Matlatzinca and Chichimeca Jonaz). Other languages in Mesoamerica that have tones are Huichol, Yukatek Maya, the Tzotzil of San Bartolo, Uspanteko, and one variety of Huave.\n\nMany languages of South America are tonal. For example, various analyses of the Pirahã language describe either two or three tones. The Ticuna language isolate is exceptional for having five register tones (the only other languages in the Americas to have such a system are Trique and Usila, mentioned above).\n\nSwedish, Norwegian and Scots have simple word tone systems, often called pitch accent (although they are actually contour tones), appearing only in words of two or more syllables. Each word has a lexical tone, which varies by dialect. Words whose pronunciation differs only in tone are frequently morphologically or etymologically unrelated and may be spelled differently, as in Norwegian \"cider\" ('cider'), \"sider\" ('sides'). The two word tones are conventionally called \";\" \"tonem 1\" and \"tonem 2\" in Norway and acute accent and grave accent in Sweden. In Norway, there are two major dialectal divisions based on tone, roughly eastern and western/northern, where the tones have different values: in the east, T1 = level low, T2 = falling; in the west/north, T1 = falling, T2 = rising-falling.\n\nIn Limburgish and Central Franconian dialects, tones can also occur in monosyllabic words: \"dáág\" ('day'), \"dáàg\" ('days'). Limburgish is typically a two-tone system, distinguishing between level high and falling, but the tones can be realized in other ways depending on syntax, and some vowels diphthongize or monophthongize under certain tones. Depending on the dialect, Latvian has a two-, three- or four-tone system.\n\nIn Roman script orthographies, a number of approaches are used. Diacritics are common, as in pinyin, but they tend to be omitted. Thai uses a combination of redundant consonants and diacritics. Tone letters may also be used, for example in Hmong RPA and several minority languages in China. Tone may simply be ignored, as is possible even for highly tonal languages: for example, the Chinese navy has successfully used toneless pinyin in government telegraph communications for decades. Likewise, Chinese reporters abroad may file their stories in toneless pinyin. Dungan, a variety of Mandarin Chinese spoken in Central Asia, has, since 1927, been written in orthographies that do not indicate tone. Ndjuka, in which tone is less important, ignores tone except for a negative marker. However, the reverse is also true: in the Congo, there have been complaints from readers that newspapers written in orthographies without tone marking are insufficiently legible.\n\nLanguages may distinguish up to five levels of pitch, though the Chori language of Nigeria is described as distinguishing six surface tone registers. Since tone contours may involve up to two shifts in pitch, there are theoretically 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 distinct tones for a language with five registers. However, the most that are actually used in a language is a tenth of that number.\n\nSeveral Kam–Sui languages of southern China have nine contrastive tones, including contour tones. For example, the Kam language has 9 tones: 3 more-or-less fixed tones (high, mid and low); 4 unidirectional tones (high and low rising, high and low falling); and 2 bidirectional tones (dipping and peaking). This assumes that checked syllables are not counted as having additional tones, as they traditionally are in China. For example, in the traditional reckoning, the Kam language has 15 tones, but 6 occur only in syllables closed with /p/, /t/ or /k/, and the other 9 occur only in syllables not ending in one of these sounds.\n\nPreliminary work on the Wobe language of Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire and the Chatino languages of southern Mexico suggests that some dialects may distinguish as many as fourteen tones, but many linguists believe that many of these will turn out to be sequences of tones or prosodic effects.\n\nAndré-Georges Haudricourt established that Vietnamese tone originated in earlier consonantal contrasts and suggested similar mechanisms for Chinese. It is now widely held that Old Chinese did not have phonemically contrastive tone. The historical origin of tone is called \"tonogenesis,\" a term coined by James Matisoff. Tone is frequently an areal rather than a genealogical feature: a language may acquire tones through bilingualism if influential neighboring languages are tonal or if speakers of a tonal language shift to the language in question and bring their tones with them. In other cases, tone may arise spontaneously and surprisingly quickly: the dialect of Cherokee in Oklahoma has tone, but the dialect in North Carolina does not although they were separated only in 1838.\n\nVery often, tone arises as an effect of the loss or merger of consonants. (Such trace effects of disappeared tones or other sounds have been nicknamed Cheshirisation, after the lingering smile of the disappearing Cheshire Cat in \"Alice in Wonderland.\") In a nontonal language, voiced consonants commonly cause following vowels to be pronounced at a lower pitch than other consonants. That is usually a minor phonetic detail of voicing. However, if consonant voicing is subsequently lost, that incidental pitch difference may be left over to carry the distinction that the voicing had carried and thus becomes meaningful (phonemic). That happened in Punjabi: the Punjabi murmured (voiced aspirate) consonants have disappeared and left tone in their wake. If the murmured consonant was at the beginning of a word, it left behind a low tone; at the end, it left behind a high tone. If there was no such consonant, the pitch was unaffected; however, the unaffected words are limited in pitch and did not interfere with the low and high tones. That produced a tone of its own, mid tone. The historical connection is so regular that Punjabi is still written as if it had murmured consonants, and tone is not marked. The written consonants tell the reader which tone to use.\n\nSimilarly, final fricatives or other consonants may phonetically affect the pitch of preceding vowels, and if they then weaken to and finally disappear completely, the difference in pitch, now a true difference in tone, carries on in their stead. This was the case with Chinese. Two of the three tones of Middle Chinese, the \"rising\" and the \"departing\" tones, arose as the Old Chinese final consonants and disappeared, while syllables that ended with neither of these consonants were interpreted as carrying the third tone, \"even\". Most varieties descending from Middle Chinese were further affected by a tone split in which each tone divided in two depending on whether the initial consonant was voiced. Vowels following a voiced consonant (depressor consonant) acquired a lower tone as the voicing lost its distinctiveness.\n\nThe same changes affected many other languages in the same area, and at around the same time (AD 1000–1500). The tone split, for example, also occurred in Thai, Vietnamese, and the Lhasa dialect of Tibetan.\n\nIn general, voiced initial consonants lead to low tones while vowels after aspirated consonants acquire a high tone. When final consonants are lost, a glottal stop tends to leave a preceding vowel with a high or rising tone (although glottalized vowels tend to be low tone so if the glottal stop causes vowel glottalization, that will tend to leave behind a low vowel). A final fricative tends to leave a preceding vowel with a low or falling tone. Vowel phonation also frequently develops into tone, as can be seen in the case of Burmese.\n\nTone arose in the Athabascan languages at least twice, in a patchwork of two systems. In some languages, such as Navajo, syllables with glottalized consonants (including glottal stops) in the syllable coda developed low tones, whereas in others, such as Slavey, they developed high tones, so that the two tonal systems are almost mirror images of each other. Syllables without glottalized codas developed the opposite tone. For example, high tone in Navajo and low tone in Slavey are due to contrast with the tone triggered by the glottalization.\n\nOther Athabascan languages, namely those in western Alaska (such as Koyukon) and the Pacific coast (such as Hupa), did not develop tone. Thus, the Proto-Athabascan word ' ('water') is toneless ' in Hupa, high-tone ' in Navajo, and low-tone \"tù\" in Slavey; while Proto-Athabascan ' ('knee') is toneless ' in Hupa, low-tone ' in Navajo, and high-tone \"\" in Slavey. provides a phonetic explanation for the opposite development of tone based on the two different ways of producing glottalized consonants with either tense voice on the preceding vowel, which tends to produce a high F0, or creaky voice, which tends to produce a low F0. Languages with \"stiff\" glottalized consonants and tense voice developed high tone on the preceding vowel and those with \"slack\" glottalized consonants with creaky voice developed low tone.\n\nThe Bantu languages also have \"mirror\" tone systems in which the languages in the northwest corner of the Bantu area have the opposite tones of other Bantu languages.\n\nThree Algonquian languages developed tone independently of one another and of neighboring languages: Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kickapoo. In Cheyenne, tone arose via vowel contraction; the long vowels of Proto-Algonquian contracted into high-pitched vowels in Cheyenne while the short vowels became low-pitched. In Kickapoo, a vowel with a following [h] acquired a low tone, and this tone later extended to all vowels followed by a fricative.\n\nIn Mohawk, a glottal stop can disappear in a combination of morphemes, leaving behind a long falling tone. Note that it has the reverse effect of the postulated rising tone in Mandarin Chinese, derived from a lost final glottal stop.\n\n\n\n"}

The distinction is disputed by non-analytic philosophers.\n\nThe distinction between use and mention can be illustrated for the word \"cheese\":\n\nThe first sentence is a statement about the substance called \"cheese\"; it uses the word 'cheese' to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word 'cheese' as a signifier; it mentions the word without using it to refer to anything other than itself.\n\nIn written language, mentioned words or phrases often appear between quotation marks (as in Chicago' contains three vowels\") or in italics (as in \"When I say \"honey\", I mean the sweet stuff that bees make\"), and style authorities such as \"Strunk and White\" insist that mentioned words or phrases must always be made visually distinct in this manner. Used words or phrases (much more common than mentioned ones) do not bear any typographic distinction. In spoken language, or in absence of the use of stylistic cues such as quotation marks or italics in written language, the audience must identify mentioned words or phrases through semantic and pragmatic cues.\n\nIf quotation marks are used, it is sometimes the practice to distinguish between the quotation marks used for speech and those used for mentioned words, with double quotes in one place and single in the other:\n\nA few authorities recommend against such a distinction, and prefer one style of quotation mark to be used for both purposes.\n\nThe general phenomenon of a term's having different references in different contexts was called \"suppositio\" (substitution) by medieval logicians. It describes how one has to substitute a term in a sentence based on its meaning—that is, based on the term's referent. In general, a term can be used in several ways. For nouns, they are:\n\nThe last sentence contains a mention example.\n\nThe use–mention distinction is especially important in analytic philosophy. Failure to properly distinguish use from mention can produce false, misleading, or meaningless statements or category errors. For example, the following correctly distinguish between use and mention:\n\nThe first sentence, a mention example, is a statement about the word \"copper\" and not the chemical element. Notably, the word is composed of six letters, but not any kind of metal or other tangible thing. The second sentence, a use example, is a statement about the chemical element copper and not the word itself. Notably, the element is composed of 29 electrons and protons and a number of neutrons, but not any letters.\n\nStanisław Leśniewski was perhaps the first to make widespread use of this distinction and the fallacy that arises from overlooking it, seeing it all around in analytic philosophy of the time, for example in Russell and Whitehead's \"Principia Mathematica\". At the logical level, a use–mention mistake occurs when two heterogeneous levels of meaning or context are confused inadvertently.\nDonald Davidson told that in his student years, \"quotation was usually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction was accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and mention of expressions\". He presented a class of sentences like\n\nwhich both use the meaning of the quoted words to complete the sentence, and mention them as they are attributed to W. V. Quine, to argue against his teachers' hard distinction. His claim was that quotations could not be analyzed as simple expressions that mention their content by means of naming it or describing its parts, as sentences like the above would lose their exact, twofold meaning.\n\nSelf-referential statements mention themselves or their components, often producing logical paradoxes, such as Quine's paradox. A mathematical analogy of self-referential statements lies at the core of Gödel's incompleteness theorem (diagonal lemma). There are many examples of self-reference and use–mention distinction in the works of Douglas Hofstadter, who makes the distinction thus:\n\nAlthough the standard notation for mentioning a term in philosophy and logic is to put the term in quotation marks, issues arise when the mention is itself of a mention. Notating using italics might require a potentially infinite number of typefaces, while putting quotation marks within quotation marks may lead to ambiguity.\n\nSome analytic philosophers have said the distinction \"may seem rather pedantic\".\n\nIn a 1977 response to analytic philosopher John Searle, Jacques Derrida mentioned the distinction as \"rather laborious and problematical\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
