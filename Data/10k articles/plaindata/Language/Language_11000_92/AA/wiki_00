Berman and Juris Hartmanis that states that all NP-complete languages look alike, in the sense that they can be related to each other by polynomial time isomorphisms.\n\nAn isomorphism between formal languages \"L\" and \"L\" is a bijective map \"f\" from strings in the alphabet of \"L\" to strings in the alphabet of \"L\", with the property that a string \"x\" belongs to \"L\" if and only if \"f\"(\"x\") belongs to \"L\". It is a polynomial time isomorphism (or \"p\"-isomorphism for short) if both \"f\" and its inverse function can be computed in an amount of time polynomial in the lengths of their arguments.\n\nBased on these results, Berman and Hartmanis conjectured that all NP-complete languages are \"p\"-isomorphic.\n\nSince \"p\"-isomorphism preserves paddability, and there exist paddable NP-complete languages, an equivalent way of stating the Berman–Hartmanis conjecture is that all NP-complete languages are paddable.\nPolynomial time isomorphism is an equivalence relation, and it can be used to partition the formal languages into equivalence classes, so another way of stating the Berman–Hartmanis conjecture is that the NP-complete languages form a single equivalence class for this relation.\n\nIf the Berman–Hartmanis conjecture is true, an immediate consequence would be the nonexistence of sparse NP-complete languages, namely languages in which the number of yes-instances of length \"n\" grows only polynomially as a function of \"n\". The known NP-complete languages have a number of yes-instances that grows exponentially, and if \"L\" is a language with exponentially many yes-instances then it cannot be \"p\"-isomorphic to a sparse language, because its yes-instances would have to be mapped to strings that are more than polynomially long in order for the mapping to be one-to-one.\n\nThe nonexistence of sparse NP-complete languages in turn implies that P ≠ NP, because if P = NP then every nontrivial language in P (including some sparse ones, such as the language of binary strings all of whose bits are zero) would be NP-complete. In 1982, Steve Mahaney published his proof that the nonexistence of sparse NP-complete languages (with NP-completeness defined in the standard way using many-one reductions) is in fact equivalent to the statement that P ≠ NP; this is Mahaney's theorem. Even for a relaxed definition of NP-completeness using Turing reductions, the existence of a sparse NP-complete language would imply an unexpected collapse of the polynomial hierarchy.\n\nAs evidence towards the conjecture, showed that an analogous conjecture with a restricted type of reduction is true: every two languages that are complete for NP under AC many-one reductions have an AC isomorphism.\nAnd found an oracle machine model in which the analogue to the isomorphism conjecture is true.\n\nEvidence against the conjecture was provided by and . Joseph and Young introduced a class of NP-complete problems, the \"k\"-creative sets, for which no \"p\"-isomorphism to the standard NP-complete problems is known.\nKurtz et al. showed that in oracle machine models given access to a random oracle, the analogue of the conjecture is not true: if \"A\" is a random oracle, then not all sets complete for NP have isomorphisms in P.\nRandom oracles are commonly used in the theory of cryptography to model cryptographic hash functions that are computationally indistinguishable from random, and the construction of Kurtz et al. can be carried out with such a function in place of the oracle. For this reason, among others, the Berman–Hartmanis isomorphism conjecture is believed false by many complexity theorists.\n"}

Within the Spanish of Bolivia there are different regional varieties. In the border areas, Bolivia shares dialectal features with the neighboring countries.\n\nThroughout Bolivia the preservation of phonemic contrast between and the lateral (i.e. the absence of yeísmo) is the norm. Aspiration of syllable-final is frequent in the lowlands, while in the highlands the sibilant tends to be preserved, realized either as a laminal or, frequently, an apical . In highland dialects, the \"trill\" phoneme (orthographic <rr> or word-initial <r>) is often assibilated, realized as a voiced apicoalveolar fricative. In highland Bolivian Spanish there is \"intense reduction\" of unstressed vowels in contact with , often resulting in syllables with as their nucleus, e.g. \"pues\" (\"well...\") pronounced .\n\nThis variety of Spanish is spoken on the Chaco-Beni plain and in the Santa Cruz valleys, a region that includes the departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, and Pando. Spanish is spoken by almost the entire population of these regions, and—like Spanish throughout the Americas—has its basis in Andalusian Spanish, but with influences of native languages such as Chiquitano, Chané and Guarani, as well as Old World languages including Portuguese and Arabic. And although it is fairly uniform across regions and social classes, there are subtle geographical differences.\n\nThis dialect is characterized by the debuccalization (\"aspiration\") of final . For example, the word \"pues\" is pronounced . For the second-person-singular pronoun and verb forms, the use of \"voseo\" is dominant. The use of diminutive \"‑ingo\" and the augmentative \"‑ango\" is unique to this dialect. For example: \"chiquitingo\" (\"very small\") and \"grandango\" (\"very large\").\n\nThis dialect is spoken mainly in the valleys and the Gran Chaco of the department of Tarija, but also in the region of Villa Abecia and Camargo (in the department of Chuquisaca), in the province of Sud Chichas (capital Tupiza), and in the Chaco regions of Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz. \nThe second-person-singular voseo is in full use in Tupiza, in the west of Tarija, and in the rest of the aforementioned areas.\nThe Chapaco accent has an intonation similar to that of Jujuy, Salta, and Tucumán in Argentina, as the territory where it was spoken before was the Río de la Plata Province of Tarija. It has similar intonation throughout the Bolivian Chaco, Tupiza (Sud Chichas) and the Chuquisaca valleys of Camargo, Villa Abecia, Azurduy, Alcalá, etc.\n\nThis variety is spoken in the departments of Cochabamba and Chuquisaca. It is somewhat similar to Andean Spanish but differs in intonation and the use of idiomatic expressions, due to the mixture of Spanish and Quechua spoken in the valleys of Bolivia.\n\nBecause many institutions and companies use \"tú\" and the \"tuteante\" verb forms for the familiar second-person singular, it is common to encounter the erroneous statement that \"tuteo\" rather than \"voseo\" is the usual form in the speech of Bolivia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "769874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=769874", "title": "Fishing trawler", "text": "Fishing trawler\n\nA fishing trawler is a commercial fishing vessel designed to operate fishing trawls. Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers. Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along the bottom of the sea or in midwater at a specified depth. A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously (double-rig and multi-rig).\n\nThere are many variants of trawling gear. They vary according to local traditions, bottom conditions, and how large and powerful the trawling boats are. A trawling boat can be a small open boat with only 30 horsepower or a large factory ship with 10,000 horsepower. Trawl variants include beam trawls, large-opening midwater trawls, and large bottom trawls, such as \"rock hoppers\" that are rigged with heavy rubber wheels that let the net crawl over rocky bottom.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the British developed the Dogger, an early type of sailing trawler commonly operated in the North Sea. The Dogger takes its name from the Dutch word \"dogger\", meaning a fishing vessel which tows a trawl. Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.\n\nThe modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.\n\nThis revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as Scarborough, Hull, Grimsby, Harwich and Yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean. The small village of Grimsby grew to become the 'largest fishing port in the world' by the mid 19th century. With the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, the Grimsby Dock Company was opened in 1854 as the first modern fishing port. The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time – the dock gates and cranes were operated by hydraulic power, and the Grimsby Dock Tower was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by William Armstrong.\n\nThe elegant Brixham trawler spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.\n\nThe earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . They weighed 40–50 tons and travelled at .\n\nThe earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was \"Pioneer LH854\". She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. Allan argued that his motivation for steam power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat. Allan built a total of ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being \"Degrave\" in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies.\n\nThe first steam boats were made of wood, but steel hulls were soon introduced and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.\n\nSteam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from weather, wind and tide. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch.\n\nSteam trawlers were introduced at Grimsby and Hull in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby.\n\nTrawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by World War I to diesel and turbines by the end of World War II.\n\nThe first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. In 1947, the company Christian Salvesen, based in Leith, Scotland, refitted a surplus \"Algerine\"-class minesweeper (HMS \"Felicity\") with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947.\n\nThe first purpose built stern trawler was \"Fairtry\" built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. \"Lord Nelson\" followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.\n\nSince World War II, commercial fishing vessels have been increasingly equipped with electronic aids, such as radio navigation aids and fish finders. During the Cold War, some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as spy ships to monitor the activities of other countries.\n\nModern trawlers are usually decked vessels designed for robustness. Their superstructure (wheelhouse and accommodation) can be forward, midship or aft. Motorised winches, electronic navigation and sonar systems are usually installed. Fishing equipment varies in sophistication depending on the size of the vessel and the technology used. Design features for modern fishing trawlers vary substantially, as many national maritime jurisdictions do not impose compulsory vessel inspection standards for smaller commercial fishing vessels.\n\nMechanised hauling devices are used on modern trawlers. Trawl winches, such as Gilson winches, net drums and other auxiliary winches are installed on deck to control the towing warps (trawling wires) and store them when not in use.\n\nModern trawlers make extensive use of contemporary electronics, including navigation and communication equipment, fish detection devices, and equipment to control and monitor gear. Just which equipment will be installed depends on the size and type of the trawler.\n\nMuch of this equipment can be controlled from the wheelhouse or bridge. Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper's chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a command console at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an integrated display. Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the deckhead.\n\nNavigational instruments, such as an autopilot and GPS, are used for manoeuvering the vessel in harbour and at sea. Radar can be used, for example, when pair trawling to keep the correct distance between the two vessels. Communication instruments range from basic radio devices to maritime distress systems and EPIRBs, as well as devices for communicating with the crew. Fish detection devices, such as echosounders and sonar, are used to locate fish.\nDuring trawling operations, a range of trawl sensors may be used to assist with controlling and monitoring gear. These are often referred to as \"trawl monitoring systems\" or \"net mensuration systems\".\n\nModern trawlers store the fish they catch in some form of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, the more likely it is to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted. Factory trawlers may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.\nCrew quarters are usually below the wheelhouse and may include bunks, with cot sides to stop the occupant from rolling out in heavy weather. The need for drying sea clothes is shown by a notice in at least one steam trawler's boiler room saying \"Do not dry oil frocks over the boiler\".\nTrawlers can be classified by their architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, or geographical origin. The classification used below follows the FAO, who classify trawlers by the gear they use.\n\nOutrigger trawlers use outriggers, or booms, to tow the trawl. These outriggers are usually fastened to, or at the foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with capstans are installed on the deck to haul the catch.\n\nOutrigger trawlers use vertical fish finders of different kinds, according to their size. Drawing (FAO)\n\nBeam trawlers are a type of outrigger trawler (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks at the end of the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.\n\nBeam trawling is used in the flatfish fisheries in the North Sea. They are equipped with equipment for hauling the net and stowing it aboard. Typically an echosounder and sonar is used for finding fish.\n\nThey are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety. Drawing (FAO)\n\nOtter trawlers deploy one or more parallel trawls kept apart horizontally using otter boards. These trawls can be towed in midwater or along the bottom. Otter trawlers range in size from sailing canoes to supertrawlers.\n\nOtter trawlers usually have two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated by its own winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.\n\nUsually otter trawlers have the superstructure forward, though it can be aft or amidship. Gallows are on the stern quarters or there is a stern gantry for operating the otter boards. Pelagic trawlers can use fish pumps to empty the cod end.\n\nPair trawlers are trawlers which operate together towing a single trawl. They keep the trawl open horizontally by keeping their distance when towing. Otter boards are not used. Pair trawlers operate both midwater and bottom trawls.\n\nThe superstructure is forward or midships and the working deck aft. Pelagic trawlers can have fish pumps to empty the codend.\n\nSide trawlers have the trawl deployed over the side with the trawl warps passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and another aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the fish hold amidships, and the transversal trawl winch forward of the superstructure. A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, \"Ross Tiger\" is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used for a longer period than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums. Drawing (FAO)\n\nStern trawlers have trawls which are deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers often have a ramp, though pelagic and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair trawlers. The superstructure is forward with an aft working deck. At the stern are gallows or a gantry for operating otter boards. Drawing (FAO)\n\nAny fish processing usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A wet fish stern trawler stores the fish in ice or sea water which has been refrigerated. A freezer stern trawler stores the fish in frozen boxes or blocks, and a factory stern trawler processes the catch. A pelagic stern trawler may use fish pumps to empty the codend.\n\nThe majority of trawlers operating on the high seas are freezer trawlers. They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, allowing them to remain at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium to large size trawlers, with the same general arrangement as stern or side trawlers. Drawing (FAO)\n\nWet fish trawlers are trawlers where the fish is kept in the hold in a fresh/wet condition, in boxes covered with ice or with ice in the fish hold. They must operate in areas close to their landing place, and the time such a vessel can spend fishing is limited. Drawing (FAO)\n\nTrawler/purse seiners are designed so the deck equipment, including an appropriate combination winch, can be rearranged and used for both methods. Blocks, purse davits, trawl gallows and rollers need to be arranged so they control the pursing lines and warp leads and in such a way as to reduce the time required to convert from one arrangement to the other. These vessels are usually classified as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.\n\nDuring both World Wars some countries created small warships by converting and arming existing trawlers or building new vessels to standard trawler designs. They were typically armed with a small naval gun and sometimes depth charges, and were used for patrolling, escorting other vessels and minesweeping.\n\nOccupational safety is a concern on fishing trawlers. For example, a United States cooperative which operates a fleet of 24 bottom trawlers in Alaskan water reported 25 fatalities over the period 2001–2012. The risk of a fatal injury was 41 times higher than the average for workers in the United States.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55424650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55424650", "title": "Invitational rhetoric", "text": "Invitational rhetoric\n\nInvitational rhetoric is a theory of rhetoric developed by Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin in 1995. Invitational rhetoric is defined as “an invitation to understanding as a means to create a relationship rooted in equality, immanent value, and self-determination.” The theory challenges the traditional definition of rhetoric as persuasion—the effort to change others—because the objective of invitational rhetoric is not to persuade but to gain an understanding of the perspectives of others.\n\nInvitational rhetoric is part of an effort to formulate alternative conceptions of rhetoric that are not “exploitative and oppressive but that contribute to a more respectful way of being a rhetor in the world.” A major assumption behind invitational rhetoric is that “the communication discipline, through its traditional constructs and theories, participates in this culture of domination,” and invitational rhetoric constitutes an effort to “contribute to the creation of more humane lives” for individuals.\n\nInvitational rhetoric is rooted in three feminist principles that “explicitly challenge the positive value the patriarchy accords to changing and thus dominating others”—equality, immanent value, and self-determination.\n\nAlthough change is not the objective of invitational rhetoric, change may occur as a result of an invitational interaction. Interacting with others inevitably produces changes of various kinds in interactants, but in the case of invitational rhetoric, both the rhetor and the audience may choose to change their perspectives as a result of the process of sharing perspectives. They do not, however, enter the interaction trying to impose their perspectives on and trying to change one another.\n\nParticipants in invitational rhetoric value diverse perspectives because they recognize that every perspective is partial; as a result, they seek multiple perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding of an issue or situation. Invitational rhetors are particularly interested in exploring perspectives that are different from their own because they provide them with new information that enlarges their understanding. Because they are eager to engage different perspectives and to allow them to affect their own thinking, invitational participants enter an interaction willing to call into question their own perspectives.\n\nIn contrast to persuasive rhetoric, which involves power-over and an attempt to establish power over others by changing them, in invitational rhetoric, the kind of power involved is power-with. This type of power is shared among the audience members and the rhetor and is used by all participants together to come to an understanding, to make a decision, or to solve a problem.\n\nInvitational rhetoric is one of many useful rhetorical options; it is not designed to be used in all situations. It is one of five modes of rhetoric—conquest, conversion, benevolent, advisory, and invitational—available to rhetors. In \"conquest rhetoric\", rhetors try to establish their idea as the best among competing positions. \"Conversion rhetoric\" is rhetoric that is designed to change the minds or behaviors of others by convincing them that another way is superior. In \"benevolent rhetoric\", the objective is to help individuals improve their lives and often involves providing useful information to others. \"Advisory rhetoric\" is designed to provide assistance requested by others; it is a response to an implicit or explicit request for information or advice.\n\nThere are two primary rhetorical options in invitational rhetoric: (1) offering perspectives; and (2) creating external conditions that encourage audience members to share their perspectives with the rhetor.\n\nOffering perspectives is the way by which rhetors share their perspectives with audience members, explaining what they know or understand about an issue or idea without advocating for those perspectives. Offering occurs verbally through the use of words to explain a rhetor’s perspective or nonverbally through wearing particular kinds of clothing or displaying symbols that suggest an individual’s identification. Wearing a charity bracelet, for example, suggests that a rhetor is identified with a certain cause or issue. Wearers of the bracelets are not attempting to persuade others to support the cause but are simply offering a perspective so that those who are curious about the bracelet can choose to explore the perspective being offered.\n\nOffering perspectives may be difficult to do in hostile situations when other interactants are not interested in hearing a different perspective or when conquest and conversion rhetorics are being used. In such cases, invitational rhetors may use re-sourcement so that they can offer their perspectives and continue to engage in invitational rhetoric. \"Re-sourcement\" is a term coined by feminist theorist Sally Miller Gearhart that means drawing energy from a new source—“a source other than the individual or system that provided the initial frame for the issue.” Re-sourcement involves two basic processes. The first is disengaging from the frame of the precipitating message—stepping away from the frame in which the message is being offered and recognizing that the response does not have to be couched in that same frame. The second process is developing a message that “does not directly argue against or even address the message being offered. It presents a response addressed to a different exigence, need, or problem from the one implicit” in the initial message. The use of re-sourcement allows rhetors to value both themselves and their audience members and provides a space for more options for interaction in the future because it has not locked participants into an adversarial framework.\n\nAn example of re-sourcement is a response suggested by linguist Suzette Haden Elgin to instances of sexual harassment. She offers what she calls the \"Boring Baroque Response\" to unwanted sexual proposals or sexually suggestive remarks. This strategy involves responding to such messages by telling a long story with many tedious details that is unrelated to and does not address the proposition offered by the instigator of the message.\nThe second primary rhetorical option in invitational rhetoric is creating external conditions. This option involves creating an environment that encourages audience members to share their perspectives with the rhetor. To accomplish this objective, the invitational rhetor attempts to create three conditions—safety, value, and freedom. \n\n\nInvitational rhetoric has been used as a tool of analysis in many articles, book chapters, books, theses, and dissertations in a variety of fields. Among the applications of invitational rhetoric are the following:\nBoth Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin have applied the theory of invitational rhetoric to public speaking and have written textbooks on the subject rooted in invitational rhetoric:\n\nFollowing are the major critiques that have been offered of the theory of invitational rhetoric. Some of the criticisms of invitational rhetoric concern conceptions of the nature and function of persuasion:\nOther critiques of the theory of invitational rhetoric are concerned with the nature of rhetoric and rhetorical theory:\n\nOther critiques of invitational rhetoric have to do with a variety of other aspects of the theory:\nTwo of the common criticisms of invitational rhetoric are misreadings of the theory. They attribute claims to invitational rhetoric that are the opposite of what Sonja Foss and Cindy Griffin explain in their original article on invitational rhetoric:\n"}

In the interwar period (1918–1945) he was active in the Association of National Minorities in Germany for the rights of non-German ethnic groups in the Germany.\n\nJan Skala was born on 17 June 1889 in Nebelschütz, Germany. He was son of a quarry worker and a Sorbian costume seamstress. After finishing Bautzen Domschule in 1901 he spent a year in the Catholic Teachers' Preparatory College. He published his Sorbian poems in 1910 and, earlier, some articles in social democratic papers. As a soldier in Russia and in the Balkans in 1916-1918, he deepened his knowledge of Slavic languages. From 1918 to 1919 \nJan was working for the Berlin Versorgungsamt. During the Spartacist riots he worked for the Berlin Security Corps. After he got a position with the Ordnance Department of the Berlin police in Moabit. From 1919 to 1920 Jan was editor of the political newspaper \"Serbski Dźenik\" in Weißwasser, and a co-founder of the People's Party and Lusatian Sorbian sports association \"Serbski Sokoł\". In 1921 he shortly worked for Sorbian newspaper \"Serbske Nowiny\", then moved to Prague where he got a position at the government newspaper \"Prager Presse\". In January 1924 Jan edited Sorbian newspaper \"Serbske Nowiny\" and started working for Union of Poles in Berlin. In 1925 to 1927 he participated in the European minority congresses work in Geneva, where he established contacts with progressive politicians and pacifists. He maintained contacts with democratic intellectuals in Czechoslovakia and Poland. \nAfter the Nazis came to power he was persecuted for his past political activities. In 1936. he was banned as a journalist and his name was deleted from the list of German writers. In 1937 he left Berlin and moved to Bautzen. On January 21, 1938 Skala was arrested together\nwith Dr. Cyž and Měrćink; all accused for conspiracy to commit treason. The People's Court in Berlin, on 1 June 1939, convicted Dr. Cyž and Měrćink of treason. The accused Skala was, for health reasons, released from the prison already on 26 October 1938.\nFrom 1939 to 1943 he worked at various Bautzen and Berlin companies. In 1943 he escaped the Berlin bombing and moved to his wife's family in Dziedzice in Upper Silesia . From 1943 to 1945 he worked at \"Elektroakustik\" in Namysłow, where he supported Polish resistance fighters. On January 22, 1945 he was killed in Dziedzice by a Soviet Army soldier.\n\nJan Skala was a Lusatian Sorb left-leaning leader and patriot, journalist and well-known poet and writer. Skala, as a poet and in his twentieth year, was writing in German Socialist papers. In his mother-tongue he commenced writing verses in 1911. He introduced into his writings more of the social than the romantic or patriotic notes that had marked the older Lusatian Sorbs writers. After the WWI he published two books of poetry: \"Drobjence\" (\"The Crumbs\") in 1920. and \"Škre\" (\"The Sparks\") in 1923. \"The Crumbs\" poems were of strong patriotic tone influenced by another Sorbian poet Čišinski. One of the poems was a call for help and support in his struggle for the Sorbian rights in Germany directed to Jugoslavs. \"The Sparks\" were love and intimate poems. As a writer Jan is known for some short narratives, the most important of them \"Stary Šymko\"(“The Old Schimko”) in which he describes how the capitalistic major industries exploited and swindled the Wends who lived in the moors. An anthology of his poetry was published in 1985 under the \"Jan Skala\" title and edited by J. Łušćanski and K. Lorenc.\n\nFor his service in the Union of Poles he was seen as a leader of the Polish minority in Germany. Jan insisted on cultural autonomy of Poles and Sorbs insisting that the existing cultural autonomy was geared to the better-organized and more affluent minorities—the Auslandsdeutschen above all. Further, he claimed that the Nationalities Congress was little more than a cloak for the extension of German influence. On the opposite side, he saw that the inability of poorer minorities to achieve cultural autonomy would lead to their assimilation. During his struggle for the minorities rights in 1930s in the German Reich, in April 1936 he published two articles in \"Slavonic and East European Review\", the organ of School of Slavic and East European Studies in the University of London, under his Sorabicus pen-name.\n\nIn the Polish city Namysłów a monument was erected to Jan Skala in 1965. In Bautzen, Germany a street was named after Jan Skala.\n\n"}

It is a concrete form of the more general I = PAT equation relating factors that determine the level of human impact on climate. The Kaya identity is both simple and tricky, as it can be reduced to only two terms, but it is developed so that the carbon emission calculation becomes easy, as per the available data, or generally in which format the data is available.\n\nThe Kaya identity was developed by Japanese energy economist Yoichi Kaya. It is the subject of his book \"Environment, Energy, and Economy: strategies for sustainability\" co-authored with Keiichi Yokobori as the output of the \"Conference on Global Environment, Energy, and Economic Development (1993 : Tokyo, Japan).\n\nKaya identity is expressed in the form: \n\nWhere:\n\nAnd:\n\nThe Kaya identity plays a core role in the development of future emissions scenarios in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. The scenarios set out a range of assumed conditions for future development of each of the four inputs. Population growth projections are available independently from demographic research; GDP per capita trends are available from economic statistics and econometrics; similarly for energy intensity and emission levels. The projected carbon emissions can drive carbon cycle and climate models to predict future CO concentration and climate change.\n\nThe Kaya identity is reviewed in a 2002 paper.\n\nA 2007 article uses the Kaya Identity in its analysis of recent trends in carbon emissions, and finds: \n... cessation or reversal of earlier declining trends in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (energy/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions/energy), coupled with continuing increases in population and per-capita GDP. Nearly constant or slightly increasing trends in the carbon intensity of energy have been recently observed in both developed and developing regions. No region is decarbonizing its energy supply.\n\n\nThe Kaya identity and its applications in climate control policies has been criticized by Mario Bunge. Bunge points out that the Kaya identity is a tautology, because it is nothing but a rewrite of the identity :formula_2, i.e., \"Carbon is carbon\". Bunge concludes that the Kaya identity is impervious to empirical data, i.e., the Kaya identity cannot be tested empirically and thus cannot be used for predictions. \nIn addition, Bunge proposes a tentative formula for the volume of global carbon emission that is not just a simple identity. Bunge suggests means to control climate and finally states \"it might also help if economics students were to take Logic 101\".\n\n\n"}

At the age of fourteen, he suddenly left school and joined the 7th Infantry Regiment; but tiring of garrison life at Setúbal after two years, he decided to enter the Portuguese navy. He proceeded to the Royal Marine Academy in Lisbon but instead of studying he pursued love adventures. For the next five years he had many love affairs, and his retentive memory and extraordinary talent for improvisation gained him a host of admirers and turned his head.\n\nThe Brazilian modinhas, little rhymed poems sung to a guitar at family parties, were very popular at the time, and Bocage added to his fame by writing a number of these, by his skill in extemporizing verses on a given theme, and by allegorical idyllic pieces, the subjects of which are similar to those of Watteau's and Boucher's pictures. In 1786 he was appointed \"guarda-marinha\" in the Portuguese India navy, and he reached Goa by way of the colony of Brazil in October. There he came into an ignorant society full of petty intrigue, where his particular talents found no scope to display themselves; the glamour of the East left him unmoved and the climate brought on a serious illness. In these circumstances he compared the heroic traditions of Portugal in Asia, which had induced him to leave home, with the reality, and wrote his satirical sonnets on \"The Decadence of the Portuguese Empire in Asia\", and those addressed to Afonso de Albuquerque and D. João de Castro. The irritation caused by these satires, together with rivalries in love affairs, made it advisable for him to leave Goa, and early in 1789 he obtained the post of lieutenant of the infantry company at Damão, India; but he promptly deserted and made his way to Macau, where he arrived in July–August. According to a modern tradition much of the \"Os Lusíadas\" had been written there, and Bocage probably travelled to China under the influence of another classic Portuguese poet, Luís de Camões, to whose life and misfortunes he loved to compare his own. Though he escaped the penalty of his desertion, he had no resources and lived on friends, whose help enabled him to return to Lisbon in the middle of the following year.\nOnce back in Portugal he found his old popularity, and resumed his vagabond existence. The age was one of reaction against the Marquis of Pombal's reforms, and the famous intendant of police, Pina Manique, in his determination to keep out French revolutionary and atheistic propaganda, forbade the importation of foreign classics and the discussion of all liberal ideas. Hence the only vehicle of expression left was satire, which Bocage employed with an unsparing hand. His poverty compelled him to eat and sleep with friends like the turbulent friar José Agostinho de Macedo, and he soon fell under suspicion with Manique. He became a member of the New Arcadia, a literary society founded in 1790, under the name of Elmano Sadino, but left it three years later. Though including in its ranks most of the poets of the time, the New Arcadia produced little of real merit, and before long its adherents became enemies and descended to an angry warfare of words. But Bocage's reputation among the general public and with foreign travellers grew year by year. Beckford, the author of \"Vathek\", for instance, describes him as a pale, limber, odd-looking young man, the queerest but perhaps the most original of God's poetical creatures. This strange and versatile character may be said to possess the true wand of enchantment which at the will of its master either animates or petrifies.\n\nIn 1797 enemies of Bocage belonging to the New Arcadia delated him to Manique, who on the pretext afforded by some anti-religious verses, the \"Epistola a Marilia\", and by his loose life, arrested him when he was about to flee the country and lodged him in the Limoeiro jail, where he spent his thirty-second birthday. His sufferings induced him to a speedy recantation, and after much importuning of friends, he obtained his transfer in November from the state prison to that of the Portuguese Inquisition, then a mild tribunal, and shortly afterwards recovered his liberty. He returned to his bohemian life and subsisted by writing empty \"Elogios Dramáticos\" for the theatres, printing volumes of verses and translating the didactic poems of Delille, Castel and others, some second-rate French plays. These resources and the help of brother Freemasons just enabled him to exist, and a purifying influence came into his life in the shape of a real affection for the two beautiful daughters of D. António Bersane Leite, which drew from him verses of true feeling mixed with regrets for the past. He would have married the younger lady, D. Anna Perpétua (Analia), but excesses had ruined his health.\n\nIn 1801 his poetical rivalry with Macedo became more acute and personal, and ended by drawing from Bocage a stinging extempore poem, \"Pena de Talião\", which remains a monument to his powers of invective. In 1804 the illness (syphilis) from which he suffered increased, and the approach of death inspired some beautiful sonnets, including one directed to D. Maria, elder sister of Analia, who visited and consoled him. He became reconciled to his enemies, and died on 21 December 1805 of an aneurysm. He died in poverty on the eve of the French invasion, in a similar way to how Camões' death came just before the occupation of Portugal by the Duke of Alva's army. The gulf that divides the life and achievements of these two poets is accounted for less by difference of talent and temperament than by their environment, and illustrates the decline of Portugal in the two centuries that separate 1580 from 1805.\n\nTo Beckford, Bocage was a powerful genius, and Link was struck by his nervous expression, harmonious versification and the fire of his poetry. He employed every variety of lyric and made his mark in all. His roundels are good, his epigrams witty, his satires rigorous and searching, his odes often full of nobility, but his fame must rest on his sonnets, which almost rival those of Camões in power, elevation of thought and tender melancholy, though they lack the latter's scholarly refinement of phrasing. So dazzled were contemporary critics by his brilliant and inspired extemporizations that they ignored Bocage's licentiousness, and overlooked the slightness of his creative output and the artificial character of most of his poetry. In 1871 a monument was erected to the poet in the chief square of Setúbal, and the centenary of his death was observed there with much circumstance in 1905.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer rudeness of some of his verse Bocage is still a genuinely popular figure today, and not only in Setúbal. The subversiveness of his poems has meant that for much of the last 200 years they have not been (officially) available in Portugal: the erotic poetry was first published anonymously towards the end of the 19th century.\n\n\nFree translation of a poem where Bocage draws his self-portrait.\n\nFree translation in English:\nOriginal in Portuguese:\n\n"}

As a member of the Northwestern branch (the northern branch of Western Iranian), etymologically speaking it is rather closely related to Gilaki, and more distantly related to Persian, which belongs to the Southwestern branch. Mazandarani is closely related to Gilaki and the two languages have similar vocabularies. The Gilaki and Mazandarani languages (but not other Iranian languages) share certain typological features with Caucasian languages (specifically South Caucasian languages), reflecting the history, ethnic identity, and close relatedness to the Caucasus region and Caucasian peoples of the Mazandarani people and Gilaki people. For the most part Mazanderani is mutually unintelligible with Persian.\n\nThe name \"Mazanderani\" (and variants of it) derives from the name of the historical region of Mazandaran (\"Mazerun\" in Mazanderani), which was part of former Kingdom of Tapuria. People traditionally call their language \"Gilaki\", similar as Gilaks do.\n\n\"Gilaki\" consist of two morphemes : \"Gil\" + postfix \"ki\". The name \"Tapuri\" (or \"Tabari\") which was the name of an ancient language of somewhere in former Tapuria, Nowadays becomes prevalent into youth groups instead of Gilaki.\nHowever, Gilan and Mazanderan were part of the same state known as Tapuria which its national language was known as Gilaki.\n\nAmong the living Iranian languages, Mazanderani has one of the longest written traditions, from the tenth to the fifteenth century. This status was achieved during the long reign of the independent and semi-independent rulers of Mazandaran in the centuries after the Arab invasion.\n\nThe rich literature of this language includes books such as \"Marzban Nameh\" (later translated into Persian) and the poetry of Amir Pazevari. The use of Mazanderani, however, has been in decline. Its literary and administrative rank was lost to Persian perhaps long before the ultimate integration of Mazandaran into the national administration in the early seventeenth century.\n\nThe Mazanderani language is closely related to Gilaki and the two languages have similar vocabularies. In 1993, according to Ethnologue, there were more than three million native speakers of Mazanderani.\n\nThe dialects of Mazanderani are Saravi, Amoli, Baboli, Ghaemshahri, Chaloosi, Nuri, Shahsavari, Ghasrani, Shahmirzadi, Damavandi, Firoozkoohi, Astarabadi and Katouli.\n\nFurthermore, an extinct variety, Gorgani, was documented back to the 14th and 15th centuries, from writings of the Horufi movement.\n\nMazanderani is an inflected and genderless language. It is SOV, but in some tenses it may be SVO, depending on dialects however.\n\nThe Gilaki and Mazandarani languages (but not other Iranian languages) share certain typological features with Caucasian languages (specifically South Caucasian languages), reflecting the history, ethnic identity, and close relatedness to the Caucasus region and Peoples of the Caucasus of the Mazandarani people.\n\nLike other modern Iranian languages there is no distinction between the dative and accusative cases, and the nominative in the sentence takes almost no indicators but with word order (depending on dialects it may end in a/o/e). Since Mazanderani lacks articles, there is no inflection for nouns in the sentence (no modifications for nouns).\nFor definition, nouns are added with \"e\" at end (\"me dətere\" meaning \"The daughter of mine\" while \"me dəter\" means \"my daughter\"). The indefinite article for single nouns is \"a-tā\" with \"tā\" for determination of number (\"a-tā kijā\" meaning \"a girl\").\nThere are some remnants from old Mazanderani that female nouns in nominative were ending with \"a\" and male nouns in nominative were ending with \"e\" (as in \"jənā\" meaning \"the woman\" and \"mərdē\" meaning \"the man\") grammatical gender still exists in other present-day close languages such as Semnani, Sangesari and Zazaki.\n\nAdpositions in Mazanderani are after words, while most of other languages including English and Persian have preposition systems in general. the only common postpositions that sometimes becoming preposition are \"Še\" and \"tā\". Frequently used postpositions are:\nThe list below is a sample list obtained from the Online Mazanderani-Persian dictionary.\n\nMazanderani is commonly written in the Perso-Arabic script. However, many use roman alphabets, for example in SMS messages.\n\nSpoken in a territory sheltered by the high Alborz mountains, Mazanderani preserves many ancient Indo-European words no longer in common use in modern Iranian languages such as Persian. Listed below are a few common Mazanderani words of archaic, Indo-European provenance.\n\nMazandarani is rich in synonyms,some such nouns also retaining the gender they possessed in Indo-European times : for instance the words \"Miš, Gal, Gerz\" all have the meaning of mouse, although they are not all of the same gender. While many Indo-Iranian languages use a masculine noun taking such related forms as \"Muš\" or \"Muska\" or \"Mušk\", in Mazandarani the most commonly used name for the mouse is the feminine noun \"Gal\".\n\nAnother example is cow, as most important symbol animal in Indo-European culture, in Mazanderani there are more than 1000 recognized words used for different states of cow, table below is specimen of vocabulary. Even contests hold for knowledge of these words.\n\nIn Iran, there are some popular companies and products, like Rika (son) or Kija (daughter), which take their name from Mazanderani words.\n\nThere are some Mazanderani loanwords in the Turkmen language.\n\n\"áme kεrkā šúnnε nεfār-sar. nεfār-sar xεsέnnε. badími nεfār-sar-e čεl-o-ču hamε bapíssεnε. bāútεmε, “vačε jān! injε, kεlum-e pali, mé-vesse έttā kεrk-kεli dεrεs hā́kεn!” vε εm nεmāšun ke pe dar-biārdε, hamun šō badímε bεmúnε sεre piεr o vačε. ande-tumi piεr o vačε bεmúnε sεre, nεmāz kέrdεnε, qεzā xέrdεnε; ba:d εz nεmāz šínε ún-var, sāāt-e čār harkεt kέrdεnε.\"\n\n\nIn dates given below, A.P. denotes the Iranian calendar, the solar calendar (365 days per year) which is official in Iran and Afghanistan.\n\n\n"}

The Assembly of the Republic granted it official recognition alongside Portuguese for local matters on 17 September 1998 with the law 7/99 of 29 January 1999.\n\nMirandese has a distinct phonology, morphology and syntax. It has its roots in the local Vulgar Latin spoken in the northern Iberian Peninsula.\n\nMirandese is a descendant of the Astur-Leonese variety spoken in the Kingdom of León and has both archaisms and innovations that differentiate it from the modern varieties of Astur-Leonese spoken in Spain. In recognition of these differences, and due to its political isolation from the rest of the Astur-Leonese speaking territory, Mirandese has adopted a different written norm to the one used in Spain for Astur-Leonese. Lexically, it shares a lot of vocabulary with Portuguese.\n\nIn the 19th century, José Leite de Vasconcelos described it as \"the language of the farms, of work, home, and love between the Mirandese\". Since 1986–87, it has been taught optionally to students at primary and lower secondary level, and has thus been somewhat recovering. By Law 7/99, Mirandese was given official recognition by the Assembly of the Republic alongside Portuguese. The law provides for its promotion and allows its usage for local matters in Miranda do Douro.\n\nToday Mirandese retains fewer than 5,000 speakers (but the number can be up to 15,000 if counting second-language speakers) in the villages of the Municipality of Miranda do Douro and in some eastern villages (such as Vilar Seco and Angueira; in Caçarelhos, it is considered recently extinct of the Municipality of Vimioso, and some linguistic influence can be observed at other villages of the municipality of Vimioso and the municipalities of Mogadouro, Macedo de Cavaleiros and Bragança.\n\nThree variants of the Mirandese language exist: Border Mirandese (\"Mirandés Raiano\"), Central Mirandese (\"Mirandés Central\") and Sendinese (\"Sendinés\"). Most speakers of Mirandese also speak Portuguese.\n\nThe main differences between Mirandese in Portugal and the Astur-Leonese languages in Spain are caused by the dominant languages in each region. Mirandese has been influenced phonetically and in lexicon by Portuguese and the Astur-Leonese languages in Spain by Spanish (Castilian). All have distinctive orthography that phonetically reflects the respective main national languages. Another difference is that Mirandese and Leonese remain very conservative, while Asturian has undergone a greater amount of change.\n\nSome historical developments in Mirandese are the following:\n\n\nAs in Portuguese, Mirandese still uses the following synthetic tenses:\n\nThe following is a sample text of the Mirandese language, written by Amadeu Ferreira, and published in the newspaper \"Público\", on 24 July 2007.\n\nThen a comparison of the previous text in three modern languages of the Asturo-leonese group:\n\nMirandese, given its status as a recognised language in Portugal after Portuguese, has been the subject in recent years of some publicity and attention in other parts of Portugal. A monthly chronicle in Mirandese, by researcher and writer Amadeu Ferreira, appears in the daily Portuguese national newspaper \"Público\". The first volume of the \"Adventures of Asterix\", named \"Asterix, L Goulés\" (\"Asterix the Gaul\"), was published in a Mirandese translation by Amadeu Ferreira in 2005, and sold throughout Portugal. Amadeu Ferreira also translated into Mirandese the epic poem by Camões, \"Os Lusíadas\" (\"Ls Lusíadas\"), under his pseudonym Francisco and published it in 2009. In 2011, the four Gospels of the Bible's New Testament were translated into Mirandese, and in 2013 the entire Bible was translated into the language by Domingos Augusto Ferreira.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20646", "title": "Morphology (linguistics)", "text": "Morphology (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, morphology () is the study of words, how they are formed, and their relationship to other words in the same language. It analyzes the structure of words and parts of words, such as stems, root words, prefixes, and suffixes. Morphology also looks at parts of speech, intonation and stress, and the ways context can change a word's pronunciation and meaning. Morphology differs from morphological typology, which is the classification of languages based on their use of words, and lexicology, which is the study of words and how they make up a language's vocabulary.\n\nWhile words, along with clitics, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of syntax, in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the grammar for that language. For example, English speakers recognize that the words \"dog\" and \"dogs\" are closely related, differentiated only by the plurality morpheme \"-s\", only found bound to noun phrases. Speakers of English, a fusional language, recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of word formation. They infer intuitively that \"dog\" is to \"dogs\" as \"cat\" is to \"cats\"; and, in similar fashion, \"dog\" is to \"dog catcher\" as \"dish\" is to \"dishwasher\". By contrast, Classical Chinese has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes (\"free\" morphemes) and depending on word order to convey meaning. (Most words in modern Standard Chinese [\"Mandarin\"], however, are compounds and most roots are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.\n\nPhonological and orthographic modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to literacy skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word.\n\nPolysynthetic languages, such as Chukchi, have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word \"təmeyŋəlevtpəγtərkən\", for example, meaning \"I have a fierce headache\", is composed of eight morphemes \"t-ə-meyŋ-ə-levt-pəγt-ə-rkən\" that may be glossed. The morphology of such languages allows for each consonant and vowel to be understood as morphemes, while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme.\n\nThe discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is morphophonology.\n\nThe history of morphological analysis dates back to the ancient Indian linguist Pāṇini, who formulated the 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology in the text \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" by using a constituency grammar. The Greco-Roman grammatical tradition also engaged in morphological analysis. Studies in Arabic morphology, conducted by Marāḥ al-arwāḥ and Aḥmad b. ‘alī Mas‘ūd, date back to at least 1200 CE.\n\nThe linguistic term \"morphology\" was coined by August Schleicher in 1859.\n\nThe term \"word\" has no well-defined meaning. Instead, two related terms are used in morphology: lexeme and word-form. Generally, a lexeme is a set of inflected word-forms that is often represented with the citation form in small capitals. For instance, the lexeme contains the word-forms \"eat, eats, eaten,\" and \"ate\". \"Eat\" and \"eats\" are thus considered different words-forms belonging to the same lexeme . \"Eat\" and \"Eater\", on the other hand, are different lexemes, as they refer to two different concepts. Thus, there are three rather different notions of ‘word’.\n\nHere are examples from other languages of the failure of a single phonological word to coincide with a single morphological word form. In Latin, one way to express the concept of 'NOUN-PHRASE and NOUN-PHRASE' (as in \"apples and oranges\") is to suffix '-que' to the second noun phrase: \"apples oranges-and\", as it were. An extreme level of this theoretical quandary posed by some phonological words is provided by the Kwak'wala language. In Kwak'wala, as in a great many other languages, meaning relations between nouns, including possession and \"semantic case\", are formulated by affixes instead of by independent \"words\". The three-word English phrase, \"with his club\", where 'with' identifies its dependent noun phrase as an instrument and 'his' denotes a possession relation, would consist of two words or even just one word in many languages. Unlike most languages, Kwak'wala semantic affixes phonologically attach not to the lexeme they pertain to semantically, but to the preceding lexeme. Consider the following example (in Kwak'wala, sentences begin with what corresponds to an English verb):\n\nkwixʔid-i-da bəgwanəma-χ-a q'asa-s-is t'alwagwayu\n\nMorpheme by morpheme translation:\n\n(Notation notes:\n\n\nThat is, to the speaker of Kwak'wala, the sentence does not contain the \"words\" 'him-the-otter' or 'with-his-club' Instead, the markers -\"i-da\" (PIVOT-'the'), referring to \"man\", attaches not to the noun \"bəgwanəma\" (\"man\") but to the verb; the markers -\"χ-a\" (ACCUSATIVE-'the'), referring to \"otter\", attach to \"bəgwanəma\" instead of to \"q'asa\" ('otter'), etc. In other words, a speaker of Kwak'wala does not perceive the sentence to consist of these phonological words:\n\nkwixʔid i-da-bəgwanəma χ-a-q'asa s-is-t'alwagwayu\n\nclubbed PIVOT-the-man hit-the-otter with-his-club\n\nA central publication on this topic is the recent volume edited by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2007), examining the mismatch between prosodic-phonological and grammatical definitions of \"word\" in various Amazonian, Australian Aboriginal, Caucasian, Eskimo, Indo-European, Native North American, West African, and sign languages. Apparently, a wide variety of languages make use of the hybrid linguistic unit clitic, possessing the grammatical features of independent words but the prosodic-phonological lack of freedom of bound morphemes. The intermediate status of clitics poses a considerable challenge to linguistic theory.\n\nGiven the notion of a lexeme, it is possible to distinguish two kinds of morphological rules. Some morphological rules relate to different forms of the same lexeme; while other rules relate to different lexemes. Rules of the first kind are inflectional rules, while those of the second kind are rules of word formation. The generation of the English plural \"dogs\" from \"dog\" is an inflectional rule, while compound phrases and words like \"dog catcher\" or \"dishwasher\" are examples of word formation. Informally, word formation rules form \"new\" words (more accurately, new lexemes), while inflection rules yield variant forms of the \"same\" word (lexeme).\n\nThe distinction between inflection and word formation is not at all clear cut. There are many examples where linguists fail to agree whether a given rule is inflection or word formation. The next section will attempt to clarify this distinction.\n\nWord formation is a process where one combines two complete words, whereas with inflection you can combine a suffix with some verb to change its form to subject of the sentence. For example: in the present indefinite, we use ‘go’ with subject I/we/you/they and plural nouns, whereas for third person singular pronouns (he/she/it) and singular nouns we use ‘goes’. So this ‘-es’ is an inflectional marker and is used to match with its subject. A further difference is that in word formation, the resultant word may differ from its source word’s grammatical category whereas in the process of inflection the word never changes its grammatical category.\n\nThere is a further distinction between two primary kinds of morphological word formation: derivation and compounding. Compounding is a process of word formation that involves combining complete word forms into a single compound form. \"Dog catcher\", therefore, is a compound, as both \"dog\" and \"catcher\" are complete word forms in their own right but are subsequently treated as parts of one form. Derivation involves affixing bound (i.e. non-independent) forms to existing lexemes, whereby the addition of the affix derives a new lexeme. The word \"independent\", for example, is derived from the word \"dependent\" by using the prefix \"in-\", while \"dependent\" itself is derived from the verb \"depend\". There is also word formation in the processes of clipping in which a portion of a word is removed to create a new one, blending in which two parts of different words are blended into one, acronyms in which each letter of the new word represents a specific word in the representation i.e. NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization, borrowing in which words from one language are taken and used in another, and finally coinage in which a new word is created to represent a new object or concept.\n\nA linguistic paradigm is the complete set of related word forms associated with a given lexeme. The familiar examples of paradigms are the conjugations of verbs and the declensions of nouns. Also, arranging the word forms of a lexeme into tables, by classifying them according to shared inflectional categories such as tense, aspect, mood, number, gender or case, organizes such. For example, the personal pronouns in English can be organized into tables, using the categories of person (first, second, third); number (singular vs. plural); gender (masculine, feminine, neuter); and case (nominative, oblique, genitive).\n\nThe inflectional categories used to group word forms into paradigms cannot be chosen arbitrarily; they must be categories that are relevant to stating the syntactic rules of the language. Person and number are categories that can be used to define paradigms in English, because English has grammatical agreement rules that require the verb in a sentence to appear in an inflectional form that matches the person and number of the subject. Therefore, the syntactic rules of English care about the difference between \"dog\" and \"dogs\", because the choice between these two forms determines which form of the verb is used. However, no syntactic rule for the difference between \"dog\" and \"dog catcher\", or \"dependent\" and \"independent\". The first two are nouns and the second two are adjectives.\n\nAn important difference between inflection and word formation is that inflected word forms of lexemes are organized into paradigms that are defined by the requirements of syntactic rules, and there are no corresponding syntactic rules for word formation. The relationship between syntax and morphology is called \"morphosyntax\" and concerns itself with inflection and paradigms, not with word formation or compounding.\n\nAbove, morphological rules are described as analogies between word forms: \"dog\" is to \"dogs\" as \"cat\" is to \"cats\" and as \"dish\" is to \"dishes\". In this case, the analogy applies both to the form of the words and to their meaning: in each pair, the first word means \"one of X\", while the second \"two or more of X\", and the difference is always the plural form \"-s\" (or \"-es\") affixed to the second word, signaling the key distinction between singular and plural entities.\n\nOne of the largest sources of complexity in morphology is that this one-to-one correspondence between meaning and form scarcely applies to every case in the language. In English, there are word form pairs like \"ox/oxen\", \"goose/geese\", and \"sheep/sheep\", where the difference between the singular and the plural is signaled in a way that departs from the regular pattern, or is not signaled at all. Even cases regarded as regular, such as \"-s\", are not so simple; the \"-s\" in \"dogs\" is not pronounced the same way as the \"-s\" in \"cats\"; and, in plurals such as \"dishes\", a vowel is added before the \"-s\". These cases, where the same distinction is effected by alternative forms of a \"word\", constitute allomorphy.\n\nPhonological rules constrain which sounds can appear next to each other in a language, and morphological rules, when applied blindly, would often violate phonological rules, by resulting in sound sequences that are prohibited in the language in question. For example, to form the plural of \"dish\" by simply appending an \"-s\" to the end of the word would result in the form , which is not permitted by the phonotactics of English. In order to \"rescue\" the word, a vowel sound is inserted between the root and the plural marker, and results. Similar rules apply to the pronunciation of the \"-s\" in \"dogs\" and \"cats\": it depends on the quality (voiced vs. unvoiced) of the final preceding phoneme.\n\nLexical morphology is the branch of morphology that deals with the lexicon, which, morphologically conceived, is the collection of lexemes in a language. As such, it concerns itself primarily with word formation: derivation and compounding.\n\nThere are three principal approaches to morphology and each tries to capture the distinctions above in different ways:\nWhile the associations indicated between the concepts in each item in that list are very strong, they are not absolute.\n\nIn morpheme-based morphology, word forms are analyzed as arrangements of morphemes. A morpheme is defined as the minimal meaningful unit of a language. In a word such as \"independently\", the morphemes are said to be \"in-\", \"depend\", \"-ent\", and \"ly\"; \"depend\" is the root and the other morphemes are, in this case, derivational affixes. In words such as \"dogs\", \"dog\" is the root and the \"-s\" is an inflectional morpheme. In its simplest and most naïve form, this way of analyzing word forms, called \"item-and-arrangement\", treats words as if they were made of morphemes put after each other (\"concatenated\") like beads on a string. More recent and sophisticated approaches, such as distributed morphology, seek to maintain the idea of the morpheme while accommodating non-concatenated, analogical, and other processes that have proven problematic for item-and-arrangement theories and similar approaches.\n\nMorpheme-based morphology presumes three basic axioms:\n\nMorpheme-based morphology comes in two flavours, one Bloomfieldian and one Hockettian. For Bloomfield, the morpheme was the minimal form with meaning, but did not have meaning itself. For Hockett, morphemes are \"meaning elements\", not \"form elements\". For him, there is a morpheme plural using allomorphs such as \"-s\", \"-en\" and \"-ren\". Within much morpheme-based morphological theory, the two views are mixed in unsystematic ways so a writer may refer to \"the morpheme plural\" and \"the morpheme \"-s\"\" in the same sentence.\n\nLexeme-based morphology usually takes what is called an item-and-process approach. Instead of analyzing a word form as a set of morphemes arranged in sequence, a word form is said to be the result of applying rules that alter a word-form or stem in order to produce a new one. An inflectional rule takes a stem, changes it as is required by the rule, and outputs a word form; a derivational rule takes a stem, changes it as per its own requirements, and outputs a derived stem; a compounding rule takes word forms, and similarly outputs a compound stem.\n\nWord-based morphology is (usually) a word-and-paradigm approach. The theory takes paradigms as a central notion. Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word forms or to generate word forms from stems, word-based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms. The major point behind this approach is that many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches. Word-and-paradigm approaches are also well-suited to capturing purely morphological phenomena, such as morphomes. Examples to show the effectiveness of word-based approaches are usually drawn from fusional languages, where a given \"piece\" of a word, which a morpheme-based theory would call an inflectional morpheme, corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories, for example, \"third-person plural\". Morpheme-based theories usually have no problems with this situation since one says that a given morpheme has two categories. Item-and-process theories, on the other hand, often break down in cases like these because they all too often assume that there will be two separate rules here, one for third person, and the other for plural, but the distinction between them turns out to be artificial. The approaches treat these as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules. Words can be categorized based on the pattern they fit into. This applies both to existing words and to new ones. Application of a pattern different from the one that has been used historically can give rise to a new word, such as \"older\" replacing \"elder\" (where \"older\" follows the normal pattern of adjectival superlatives) and \"cows\" replacing \"kine\" (where \"cows\" fits the regular pattern of plural formation).\n\nIn the 19th century, philologists devised a now classic classification of languages according to their morphology. Some languages are isolating, and have little to no morphology; others are agglutinative whose words tend to have lots of easily separable morphemes; others yet are inflectional or fusional because their inflectional morphemes are \"fused\" together. That leads to one bound morpheme conveying multiple pieces of information. A standard example of an isolating language is Chinese. An agglutinative language is Turkish. Latin and Greek are prototypical inflectional or fusional languages.\n\nIt is clear that this classification is not at all clearcut, and many languages (Latin and Greek among them) do not neatly fit any one of these types, and some fit in more than one way. A continuum of complex morphology of language may be adopted.\n\nThe three models of morphology stem from attempts to analyze languages that more or less match different categories in this typology. The item-and-arrangement approach fits very naturally with agglutinative languages. The item-and-process and word-and-paradigm approaches usually address fusional languages.\n\nAs there is very little fusion involved in word formation, classical typology mostly applies to inflectional morphology. Depending on the preferred way of expressing non-inflectional notions, languages may be classified as synthetic (using word formation) or analytic (using syntactic phrases).\n\nPingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Similar to other languages, words in Pingelapese can take different forms to add to or even change its meaning. Verbal suffixes are morphemes added at the end of a word to change its form. Prefixes are those that are added at the front. For example, the Pingelapese suffix –\"kin\" means ‘with’ or 'at.’ It is added at the end of a verb.\n\n\"ius\" = to use --> \"ius-kin\" = to use with\n\n\"mwahu\" = to be good --> \"mwahu-kin\" = to be good at\n\n\"sa-\" is an example of a verbal prefix. It is added to the beginning of a word and means ‘not.’\n\n\"pwung\" = to be correct --> \"sa-pwung\" = to be incorrect\n\nThere are also directional suffixes that when added to the root word gives the listener a better idea of where the subject is headed. The verb \"alu\" means to walk. A directional suffix can be used to give more detail.\n\n\"-da\" = ‘up’ --> \"aluh-da\" = to walk up\n\n\"-d\"i = ‘down’ --> \"aluh-di\" = to walk down\n\n\"-eng\" = ‘away from speaker and listener’ --> \"aluh-eng\" = to walk away\n\nDirectional suffixes are not limited to motion verbs. When added to non-motion verbs, their meanings are a figurative one. The following table gives some examples of directional suffixes and their possible meanings.\n\n"}

Three distinct dialects are recognized: \n\nNogai is generally classified into the Kipchak–Nogai branch of Kipchak Turkic. The latter also includes Crimean Tatar, Karakalpak in Uzbekistan, Kazakh in Kazakhstan, and Kirgiz in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe Nogai, descended from the peoples of the Golden Horde, take their name and that of their language from the grandson of Genghis Khan, Nogai Khan, who ruled the nomadic people west of the Danube toward the end of the 13th century. They then settled along the Black Sea coast of present-day Ukraine.\n\nOriginally, the Nogai alphabet was based on the Arabic script. In 1928, a Latin alphabet was introduced. It was devised by the Nogai academic Abdulkhamid Dzhanibekov (Djanibek), following principles adopted for all Turkic languages.\n\nIn 1938, a transition to the Russian alphabet began. The orthography based on the Latin alphabet had allegedly been an impediment to learning Russian.\n\nThe expulsion of the Nogai from Ukraine in the nineteenth century separated Nogai speakers into several geographically isolated groups. Some went to Turkey and Romania, while others stayed within the Russian Empire, settling in northern Dagestan and neighbouring areas of Chechnya and Stavropol Kray.\n\nBeing a Turkic language, the Nogai language disappeared very rapidly in Turkey. Today it is mostly spoken by the older generation. In the Soviet Union the language of instruction in schools was Russian and the number of speakers declined there also. Recent estimates place the total number of Nogai speakers at about 80,000.\n\nIn 1973, two small Nogai-language newspapers were being published, one in Karachay–Cherkessia and another in the Dagestan Autonomous SSR (\"Ленин йолы\"), but because of poor communications these papers did not reach Nogai villages.\n\nNogai is now part of the school curriculum from the 1st to the 10th year in the Nogai District of Dagestan. It is also taught at the Karachayevo-Cherkess Pedagogical School and the national branch of the Pedagogical Institute.\n\nPhonemes in brackets indicate allophones, parentheses indicate copied lexical sounds.\n\nBefore 1928 the alphabet used for the Nogai language was based on the Arabic script. It included all the letters of the Arabic plus the additional symbols for the specific sounds of the Nogai. This alphabet was not widespread.\n\nIn 1928 the Nogai alphabet based on Latin as part of the Soviet-wide Latinization campaign. A. Sh. Dzhanibekov, a high school teacher was the author of this alphabet.\nThe letters C c, I̡ ı̡, F f, H h, X x, Ƶ ƶ were added in 1931, and the letter S̷ s̷ in 1933. In 1936 the letters Ç ç, Ә ә, H h, I̡ ı̡ were excluded from the alphabet.\n\nThe Nogai alphabet based on Cyrillic was created in 1938. It included all of the Russian alphabet letters except Ё ё), and also the digraphs Гъ гъ, Къ къ, Нъ нъ. The digraphs Оь оь, Уь уь were added in the same year. In 1944 the digraphs Гъ гъ, Къ къ were excluded from the alphabet. The last reform of the Nogai alphabet took place in 1950, when it attained the current form.\n\n"}

An interesting example of issuing provisional stamps occurred during the Spanish–American War when supplies of stamps were low and the U.S. had occupation forces in Cuba. They are known as the \"Puerto Principe\" provisional stamps of 1898–1899. Over 40 different combinations of overprinted valuations and underlying Spanish Cuban stamps were produced under the auspices of the military forces over a three-week period from December 19, 1898 to January 11, 1899. These were replaced by another provisional set produced by overprinting U.S. stamps in the United States for Cuba. This second set of provisional stamps was sold for about eight months before the U.S. could print Cuban stamps. The U.S. civilian provisionals also included overprinted postal cards and stamped envelopes.\n\nProvisional stamps are usually made by overprinting, surcharging and occasionally by bisecting pre-existing stamps.\n\nA subcategory, Postmasters' provisionals, of particular importance in United States philately, comprises stamps that were issued by local postmasters in nations that had not yet begun to issue stamps for countrywide use. Between 1845, when the United States standardardized national postage rates, and 1847, when the post office issued its first stamps, postmasters' provisionals were introduced in eleven American cities, including New York, Providence, Rhode Island and St. Louis, Missouri. Many of these stamps (particularly from smaller cities such as Millbury, Massachusetts) are notable for their great rarity, or for their relative crudity of design.\n\nPostmasters' provisionals also played a significant role in early history of the Confederate States of America. Many localities began furnishing them after U.S. mail service ceased delivering Confederate mail in June 1861; for it was only in October that Confederate stamps for nationwide use first appeared.\n\n"}

She wrote prolifically in both Polish and Yiddish, focusing on prewar Jewish cultural life and postwar Holocaust documentation and witness testimonies. She was one of the three surviving members of the covert Oyneg Shabes group led by Emanuel Ringelblum that chronicled daily life in the Warsaw Ghetto, and she initiated the excavation of the group's buried manuscripts after the war. In Israel, she directed the Department for the Collection of Witness Testimony at Yad Vashem from 1954 to 1968.\n\nRokhl Eiga Auerbakh was born in Łanowce, Podolia to Khanina Auerbakh and his wife Mania (née Kimelman). At a young age, she and her family moved to Lviv. She had one brother who died in 1935; her parents also died before World War II.\n\nAuerbakh attended the Adam Mickewicz Gymnasium in Lviv and completed her graduate studies at the Jan Kazimierz University in the fields of philosophy and general history.\n\nAuerbakh began her writing career in 1925 as a journalist for \"Chwila\", a Polish Zionist daily newspaper published in Lviv. In the second half of the decade she worked for the \"Morgen\" Yiddish daily newspaper as an editor and writer. Between 1929 and 1930 she edited a literary column in a weekly published by the Poalei Zion movement. She was an editor of \"Tsushtayer\", a Yiddish literary journal, and coeditor and contributor to \"Yidish\", another Galician journal that emphasized the cultural movement.\n\nRelocating to Warsaw in 1933, she was a frequent contributor to the leading Yiddish and Polish newspapers and literary journals of the day. She wrote on \"Polish and Yiddish literature, education, psychology, folklore, art, linguistics and theater\", and paid special attention to Yiddish and Polish women writers and authors.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Poland, Auerbakh was interned in the Warsaw Ghetto. She overtly worked as the director of a soup kitchen and covertly as a member of the secret Oyneg Shabes group organized by Emanuel Ringelblum, which recruited historians, writers, rabbis, and social workers to chronicle daily life in the Ghetto. Auerbakh kept a diary in Polish and also wrote a vivid account titled \"Two Years in the Ghetto\", which described the pervasive hunger that she witnessed. She interviewed and transcribed the testimony of Abraham Krzepicki, an escapee from the Treblinka extermination camp, between December 28, 1942 and March 7, 1943.\n\nAuerbakh escaped from the Warsaw Ghetto on March 9, 1943 and worked on the Aryan side as a Polish secretary, aided by her \"non-Jewish\" appearance and fluency in the German language. By night, she continued recording her historical notes of Jews at that time. At the request of an underground Jewish committee, she wrote \"Yizkor\", a lengthy essay about the summer 1942 Warsaw Ghetto deportation, and another piece recounting the lives of \"Jewish writers, artists and cultural activists in Warsaw\", both of which were widely circulated underground. \"Yizkor\", the only one of her works to be translated into English, featured themes that would appear frequently in the books she wrote after the war, including \"the importance of the culture that was destroyed; the humanity and specific identity of the victims; the responsibility to remember; and the difficulty of finding appropriate words to convey the enormity of the loss\". At one point Auerbakh was spotted writing at night by candlelight and gave her manuscripts for safekeeping to Polish Righteous Among the Nations Dr. Jan Żabiński, director of the Warsaw Zoo; he buried them on the zoo grounds and she retrieved them after the war.\n\nAt war's end, Auerbakh was one of only three surviving members of the Oyneg Shabes group. She initiated the search for and excavation of the documents buried by the group in the Warsaw Ghetto, which yielded the Ringelblum Archive.\n\nAuerbakh dedicated the rest of her life to collecting witness testimony and writing about the people she had known before and during the Holocaust in Poland. From 1945 to 1950 she worked at the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw collecting witness testimonies, mainly from survivors of Treblinka. In November 1945 she was a member of a fact-finding mission to Treblinka conducted by the Polish State Committee for the Investigation of Nazi War Crimes on Polish Soil, and published a report and analysis of the functioning of the camp and those who were murdered. She co-founded the Central Jewish Historical Commission in Łódź and served as literary and history editor for its publication \"Dos Naye Leben\". She created guidelines for collecting witness testimony and began publishing testimonies in Yiddish and Polish.\n\nIn 1950 she and several colleagues quit the Commission when Jewish communists began to exert more influence over its activities. She immigrated to Israel, settling in Tel Aviv. \n\nOn March 1, 1954, Auerbakh was named director of Yad Vashem's new Department for the Collection of Witness Testimony, which was based in Tel Aviv where most Holocaust survivors had settled. In this role, she interviewed local survivors and began compiling a database of survivors who lived elsewhere. She introduced new methodologies for collecting witness testimonies and trained Holocaust archivists and researchers. While she encouraged survivors to write their memoirs, she was critical of the popular novels being written about the Holocaust in the genre of historical fiction. She continued to write articles and books about Jewish cultural life before and during the Holocaust in her native Polish and Yiddish, finding it difficult to attain fluency in Hebrew.\n\nAuerbakh accorded great importance to witness testimonies as a Holocaust research tool for three reasons. First, the available Holocaust documentation largely originated from Nazi sources, which \"told only the story of the murderers, but not of the murdered\". Witness testimony allowed researchers to understand Jewish lives during the Holocaust, not just the mechanics of Jewish deaths. Second, she saw these testimonies as therapeutic for the survivors, saying: \"I am convinced that the confessions, called giving testimony, from the era of the Holocaust have a calming and healing inﬂuence and help free them [the survivors] from the horrors\". Third, she believed it was crucial to build documentation that could be used in future criminal trials of Nazis. Auerbakh later gathered witness testimonies for the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann and personally testified at that trial regarding spiritual life in the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nBy 1965 Auerbakh's department had amassed a collection of 3,000 witness testimonies in 15 languages. However, she and other \"survivor historians\" experienced ongoing tension with the Yad Vashem directorate, headed by Ben-Zion Dinur, who viewed Holocaust research as also embracing \"the war against anti-Semitism\", \"persecution of the Jews\", \"research on the Jewish question\", and \"hatred of Israel\". Tensions between Auerbakh and Dinur reached a head in 1957–1958, but Auerbakh emerged with her department intact and a large measure of public opinion on the side of the survivor historians. However, in 1968, when she turned 65, the Yad Vashem directorate demanded that she retire.\n\nShe was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1972 and was hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease in December 1975. She died on May 31, 1976 at the age of 72.\n\nAuerbakh willed her estate to Yad Vashem. The Rokhl Auerbach Personal Archives (Inventory no. P–16) at Yad Vashem contain \"personal, published and unpublished manuscripts in Polish and Yiddish, preparatory material concerning her testimony at the Nuremberg and Eichmann Trials, declarations, correspondence, recordings, photographs, film, scripts (in Polish, Yiddish and English), and administrative documents concerning the Department for Collecting Witness Testimony at Yad Vashem\".\n\nAuerbakh never married. She lived with Polish Jewish poet Itzik Manger in prewar Warsaw and was the inspiration for some of his poems. She rescued Manger's archive and returned it to him in London after the war.\n\nIn addition to her many newspaper articles and essays, Auerbakh wrote the following books:\n\n\n"}

One of the Ethiopian Semitic languages, its speakers are the Silt'e, who mainly inhabit the Silte Zone in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region. Speakers of the Wolane dialect mainly inhabit the Kokir Gedebano district of Gurage Zone, as well as the neighbouring Seden Sodo district of Oromia. Some have also settled in urban areas in other parts of the country, especially Addis Ababa.\n\nDialects of the Silt'e language include: Azernet-Berbere, Silti, Wuriro, Ulbareg and Wolane. There are about 940,000 native Silt'e speakers (2007 census); 125,000 speakers of Wolane.\n\nSilt'e has a fairly typical set of consonants for an Ethiopian Semitic language. There are the usual ejective consonants, alongside plain voiceless and voiced consonants and all of the consonants, except and , can be geminated, that is, lengthened. However, Silt'e vowels differ considerably from the typical set of seven vowels in languages such as Amharic, Tigrinya and Ge'ez. Silt'e has the set of five short and five long vowels that are typical of the nearby Eastern Cushitic languages, which may be the origin of the Silt'e system. There is considerable allophonic variation within the short vowels, especially for \"a\"; the most frequent allophone of , , is shown in the chart. All of the short vowels may be devoiced preceding a pause.\n\nThe charts below show the phonemes of Silt'e. For the representation of Silt'e consonants, this article uses a modification of a system that is common (though not universal), among linguists who work on Ethiopian Semitic languages, but differs somewhat from the conventions of the International Phonetic Alphabet. When the IPA symbol is different, it is indicated in brackets in the charts. The symbols and (glottal stop) appear in parentheses, because they play only a marginal role in the system, , because it appears in only a few words in the Azarnat dialect and , because (as in Amharic), it is often omitted.\n\nSince at least the 1980s, Silt'e has been written in the Ge'ez alphabet (Ethiopic), originally developed for the now-extinct Ge'ez language and most familiar today in its use for Amharic and Tigrinya.\n\nThis orthographic system makes distinctions among only seven vowels. Some of the short-long distinctions in Silt'e are therefore not marked. In practice, this probably does not interfere with comprehension because there are relatively few minimal pairs based on vowel length.\nIn written Silt'e, the seven Ge'ez vowels are mapped onto the ten Silt'e vowels as follows:\n\nMeshesha Make Jobo reports that the use of the Silt'e language is being replaced by the use of Amharic by some speakers for some domains. He points to large political and social factors, many from the national level. He also points out smaller, local factors, such as the lack of creatively genres.\n\n\n"}

According to Lacan, \"sinthome\" is the Latin way (1495 Rabelais, IV,63) of spelling the Greek origin of the French word \"symptôme\", meaning symptom. The seminar is a continuing elaboration of his topology, extending the previous seminar's focus (\"RSI\") on the Borromean Knot and an exploration of the writings of James Joyce. Lacan redefines the psychoanalytic symptom in terms of his topology of the subject.\n\nIn \"Psychoanalysis and its Teachings\" (\"Écrits\") Lacan views the symptom as inscribed in a writing process, not as ciphered message which was the traditional notion. In his seminar \"L'angoisse\" (1962–63) he states that the symptom does not call for interpretation: in itself it is not a call to the Other but a pure jouissance addressed to no one. This is a shift from the linguistic definition of the symptom — as a signifier — to his assertion that \"the symptom can only be defined as the way in which each subject enjoys (\"jouit\") the unconscious in so far as the unconscious determines the subject.\" He goes from conceiving the symptom as a message which can be deciphered by reference to the unconscious structured like a language to seeing it as the trace of the particular modality of the subject's \"jouissance\".\n\nThis shift from linguistics to topology constitutes the status of the \"sinthome\" as unanalyzable. The seminar extends the theory of the Borromean knot, which in \"RSI\" (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary) had been proposed as the structure of the subject, by adding the \"sinthome\" as the fourth ring to the triad already mentioned, tying together a knot which constantly threatens to come undone. Since meaning (\"sens\") is already figured within the knot, at the intersection of the Symbolic and the Imaginary, it follows that the function of the \"sinthome\" — knotting together the Real, the Imaginary and the Symbolic — is beyond meaning.\n\n\n\n"}

It was not mutually intelligible with Berbice Creole Dutch, also spoken in Guyana. This language has been classified as extinct since 1998.\n\nBy the twentieth century, the existence of a Dutch creole language in the former Essequibo colony was largely forgotten about, and the language only gained the interest of linguists after the Guyanan linguist Ian E. Robertson, who had already brought Berbice Creole Dutch to the attention of the scientific community, also found people on the Essequibo River who remembered a Dutch creole language. In contrast to Berbice Creole Dutch, however, Skepi—which name derives from \"Yskepi\", the first Dutch name of the Essequibo River—was not actively spoken anymore during Robertson's fieldwork. The sample sentences and a Swadesh list compiled by Robertson were thus based on the memories of non-native speakers of the language still spoken by their parents or grandparents.\n\nAfter Robertson published his material, some older sources emerged. In the memoir of reverend Thomas Youd, who was a missionary in British Guiana, it is asserted that British missionaries learnt Skepi in the 1830s and that they used this language in their church services. According to this memoir, these missionaries also produced a dictionary of the language, which since has been lost, however. This is equally the case for a \"word list submitted by a German veterinary surgeon.\"\n\nIn 2013, a letter written by Essequibo planter Wernard van Vloten emerged which contained a small fragment in Skepi Dutch. This letter, which was dated 26 September 1780, is believed to be the oldest source of the Skepi language.\n\nSince the language was already extinct when Ian Robertson first investigated the Dutch creoles in Guyana in 1975, much of Skepi is known only through the memory the descendants of native speakers have of the language their forefathers spoke. The following three sample sentences appeared in a Zeelandic newspaper in 1997.\n\nTranslation: \"I want a slice of bread.\"\n\nTranslation: \"Where shall I put it?\"\n\nTranslation: \"It was not you, it was that other minister (clergyman).\"\n\nTranslation: \"[...] and try to come one beautiful day to Uncle who lives in a warm country, and when he comes back to the country of the White people, he will bring nice things for the four children.’\"\n\n"}
{"id": "25022347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25022347", "title": "Subcategorization", "text": "Subcategorization\n\nIn linguistics, subcategorization denotes the ability/necessity for lexical items (usually verbs) to require/allow the presence and types of the syntactic arguments with which they co-occur. The notion of subcategorization is similar to the notion of valency, although the two concepts (subcategorization and valency) stem from different traditions in the study of syntax and grammar.\n\nWhile subcategorization is a concept that can apply to almost any type of lexical item, it is usually discussed with respect to verbs. Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively. The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\nThe verb \"worked/work\" is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here \"Luke\"), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb \"ate/eat\" is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here \"Indiana Jones\" and \"chilled monkey brain\"), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb \"waited/wait\" subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition \"for\". In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as lexical information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of phrase structure grammars, e.g. Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, and Minimalism.\n\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of valency, although subcategorization originates with phrase structure grammars in the Chomskyan tradition, whereas valency originates with Lucien Tesnière of the dependency grammar tradition. The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject. As it was originally conceived of, subcategorization did not include the subject, that is, a verb subcategorized for its complement(s) (=object and oblique arguments) but not for its subject. Many modern theories now include the subject in the subcategorization frame, however. Valency, in contrast, included the subject from the start. In this regard, subcategorization is moving in the direction of valency, since many phrase structure grammars now see verbs subcategorizing for their subject as well as for their object(s).\n\n"}

During the 3rd millennium BC, an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Semitic-speaking Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian and the East Semitic language Akkadian on each other is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a \"Sprachbund\".\n\nAkkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language around 2000 BC (the exact dating being subject to debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Akkadian speaking Mesopotamian states such as Assyria and Babylonia until the 1st century AD. Thereafter it was likely forgotten until the 19th century, when Assyriologists began deciphering the cuneiform inscriptions and excavated tablets left by these speakers.\n\nThe history of written Sumerian can be divided into several periods:\nArchaic Sumerian is the earliest stage of inscriptions with linguistic content, beginning with the Jemdet Nasr (Uruk III) period from about the 31st to 30th centuries BC. It succeeds the proto-literate period, which spans roughly the 35th to 30th centuries.\n\nSome versions of the chronology may omit the Late Sumerian phase and regard all texts written after 2000 BC as Post-Sumerian. The term \"Post-Sumerian\" is meant to refer to the time when the language was already extinct and preserved by Babylonians and Assyrians only as a liturgical and classical language for religious, artistic and scholarly purposes. The extinction has traditionally been dated approximately to the end of the Third Dynasty of Ur, the last predominantly Sumerian state in Mesopotamia, about 2000 BC. However, that date is very approximate, as many scholars have contended that Sumerian was already dead or dying as early as around 2100 BC, by the beginning of the Ur III period, and others believe that Sumerian persisted, as a spoken language, in a small part of Southern Mesopotamia (Nippur and its surroundings) until as late as 1700 BC. Whatever the status of spoken Sumerian between 2000 and 1700 BC, it is from then that a particularly large quantity of literary texts and bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian lexical lists survive, especially from the scribal school of Nippur. They and the particularly-intensive official and literary use of the language in Akkadian-speaking states during the same time call for a distinction between the Late Sumerian and the Post-Sumerian periods.\n\nThe standard variety of Sumerian was \"eme-g̃ir\". A notable variety or sociolect was \"eme-sal\" (𒅴𒊩 EME.SAL),\npossibly to be interpreted as \"fine tongue\" or \"high-pitched voice\" (Rubio (2007) p. 1369). Other terms for dialects or registers were\n\"eme-galam\" \"high tongue\", \"eme-si-sa\" \"straight tongue\", \"eme-te-na\" \"oblique[?] tongue\", etc.\n\n\"Eme-sal\" is used exclusively by female characters in some literary texts (that may be compared to the female languages or language varieties that exist or have existed in some cultures, such as among the Chukchis and the Island Caribs). In addition, it is dominant in certain genres of cult songs. The special features of \"eme-sal\" are mostly phonological (for example, \"m\" is often used instead of \"g̃\" (i.e. ) as in \"me\" as opposed to the \"g̃e\", \"I\"), but words different from the standard language are also used (\"ga-ša-an\" rather than standard \"nin\", \"lady\").\n\nSumerian is an agglutinative, split ergative, and subject-object-verb language. It behaves as a nominative–accusative language in the 1st and 2nd persons of the incomplete tense-aspect, but as ergative–absolutive in most other forms of the indicative mood. \n\nSumerian nouns are organized in two grammatical genders based on animacy: animate and inanimate. Animate nouns include humans, gods, and in some instances the word for \"statue\". Suffixes mark a noun's case: absolutive (-Ø), ergative (\"-e\"), dative/allative (\"-r(a)\" animate, \"-e\" inanimate, \"to, for\"), genitive (\"-(a)k\" \"of\"), locative (\"-a\", only inanimate, \"in, at\"), comitative (\"-da\" \"with\"), equative (\"-gin\" \"as, like\"), directive/adverbial (\"-š(e)\" \"toward\"), ablative (\"-ta\", only inanimate, \"from\"). The naming and number of cases vary according to differing analyses of Sumerian linguistics. Noun phrases are right branching with adjectives and modifiers following nouns.\n\nSumerian verbs have a tense-aspect complex, contrasting complete and incomplete actions/states. The two have different conjugations and many have different roots. Verbs also mark mood, voice, polarity, iterativity, and intensity; and agree with subjects and objects in number, person, animacy, and case. Sumerian moods are: indicative, imperative, cohortative, precative/affirmative, prospective aspect/cohortative mood, affirmative/negative-volitive, unrealised-volitive?, negative?, affirmative?, polarative, and are marked by a verbal prefix. The prefixes appear to conflate mood, aspect, and polarity; and their meanings are also affected by the tense-aspect complex. Sumerian voices are: active, and middle or passive. Verbs are marked for three persons: 1st, 2nd, 3rd; in two numbers: singular and plural. Finite verbs have three classes of prefixes: modal prefixes, conjugational prefixes, and pronominal/dimensional prefixes. Modal prefixes confer the above moods on the verb. Conjugational prefixes are thought to confer perhaps venitive/andative, being/action, focus, valency, or voice distinctions on the verb. Pronominal/dimensional prefixes correspond to noun phrases and their cases. Non-finite verbs include participles and relative clause verbs, both formed through nominalisation. Finite verbs take prefixes and suffixes, non-finite verbs only take suffixes. Verbal roots are mostly monosyllabic, though verbal root duplication and suppletion can also occur to indicate plurality. Root duplication can also indicate iterativity or intensity of the verb.\n\nSumerian is a language isolate. Ever since decipherment, it has been the subject of much effort to relate it to a wide variety of languages. Because it has a peculiar prestige as the most ancient written language, proposals for linguistic affinity sometimes have a nationalistic background. Such proposals enjoy virtually no support amongst linguists because of their unverifiability. Sumerian was at one time widely held to be an Indo-European language, but that view later came to be almost universally rejected.\n\nA few examples of proposed linguistic affiliations include:\n\nIt has also been suggested that the Sumerian language descended from a late Paleolithic creole language (Høyrup 1992). However, no conclusive evidence, only some typological features, can be found to support Høyrup's view.\n\nA more widespread hypothesis posits a Proto-Euphratean language that preceded Sumerian in Southern Mesopotamia and exerted an areal influence on it, especially in the form of polysyllabic words that appear \"un-Sumerian\"–making them suspect of being loanwords–and are not traceable to any other known language. There is little speculation as to the affinities of this substratum language, or these languages, and it is thus best treated as unclassified. Researchers such as Gonzalo Rubio disagree with the assumption of a single substratum language and argue that several languages are involved. A related proposal by Gordon Whittaker is that the language of the proto-literary texts from the Late Uruk period ( 3350–3100 BC) is really an early Indo-European language which he terms \"Euphratic\".\n\nThe Sumerian language is one of the earliest known written languages. The \"proto-literate\" period of Sumerian writing spans c. 3300 to 3000 BC. In this period, records are purely logographic, with phonological content. The oldest document of the proto-literate period is the Kish tablet. Falkenstein (1936) lists 939 signs used in the proto-literate period (late Uruk, 34th to 31st centuries).\n\nRecords with unambiguously linguistic content, identifiably Sumerian, are those found at Jemdet Nasr, dating to the 31st or 30th century BC. From about 2600 BC, the logographic symbols were generalized using a wedge-shaped stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay. This \"cuneiform\" (\"wedge-shaped\") mode of writing co-existed with the pre-cuneiform archaic mode. Deimel (1922) lists 870 signs used in the Early Dynastic IIIa period (26th century). In the same period the large set of logographic signs had been simplified into a logosyllabic script comprising several hundred signs. Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-Sargonian) Lagash. The pre-Sargonian period of the 26th to 24th centuries BC is the \"Classical Sumerian\" stage of the language.\n\nThe cuneiform script was adapted to Akkadian writing beginning in the mid third millennium. Our knowledge of Sumerian is based on Akkadian glossaries. During the \"Sumerian Renaissance\" (Ur III) of the 21st century BC, Sumerian was written in already highly abstract cuneiform glyphs directly succeeded by Old Assyrian cuneiform.\n\nDepending on the context, a cuneiform sign can be read either as one of several possible logograms, each of which corresponds to a word in the Sumerian spoken language, as a phonetic syllable (V, VC, CV, or CVC), or as a determinative (a marker of semantic category, such as occupation or place). (See the article Transliterating cuneiform languages.) Some Sumerian logograms were written with multiple cuneiform signs. These logograms are called diri-spellings, after the logogram 'diri' which is written with the signs SI and A. The text transliteration of a tablet will show just the logogram, such as the word 'diri', not the separate component signs.\n\nNot all epigraphists are equally reliable, and before a scholar publishes an important treatment of a text, the scholar will often arrange to collate the published transcription against the actual tablet, to see if any signs, especially broken or damaged signs, should be represented differently.\n\nThe key to reading logosyllabic cuneiform came from the Behistun inscription, a trilingual cuneiform inscription written in Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian. (In a similar manner, the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs was the bilingual Rosetta stone and Jean-François Champollion's transcription in 1822.)\n\nIn 1838 Henry Rawlinson, building on the 1802 work of Georg Friedrich Grotefend, was able to decipher the Old Persian section of the Behistun inscriptions, using his knowledge of modern Persian. When he recovered the rest of the text in 1843, he and others were gradually able to translate the Elamite and Akkadian sections of it, starting with the 37 signs he had deciphered for the Old Persian. Meanwhile, many more cuneiform texts were coming to light from archaeological excavations, mostly in the Semitic Akkadian language, which were duly deciphered.\n\nBy 1850, however, Edward Hincks came to suspect a non-Semitic origin for cuneiform. Semitic languages are structured according to consonantal forms, whereas cuneiform, when functioning phonetically, was a syllabary, binding consonants to particular vowels. Furthermore, no Semitic words could be found to explain the syllabic values given to particular signs. Julius Oppert suggested that a non-Semitic language had preceded Akkadian in Mesopotamia, and that speakers of this language had developed the cuneiform script.\n\nIn 1855 Rawlinson announced the discovery of non-Semitic inscriptions at the southern Babylonian sites of Nippur, Larsa, and Uruk.\n\nIn 1856, Hincks argued that the untranslated language was agglutinative in character. The language was called \"Scythic\" by some, and, confusingly, \"Akkadian\" by others. In 1869, Oppert proposed the name \"Sumerian\", based on the known title \"King of Sumer and Akkad\", reasoning that if Akkad signified the Semitic portion of the kingdom, Sumer might describe the non-Semitic annex.\n\nCredit for being first to scientifically treat a bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian text belongs to Paul Haupt, who published \"Die sumerischen Familiengesetze\" (The Sumerian family laws) in 1879.\n\nErnest de Sarzec began excavating the Sumerian site of Tello (ancient Girsu, capital of the state of Lagash) in 1877, and published the first part of \"Découvertes en Chaldée\" with transcriptions of Sumerian tablets in 1884. The University of Pennsylvania began excavating Sumerian Nippur in 1888.\n\n\"A Classified List of Sumerian Ideographs\" by R. Brünnow appeared in 1889.\n\nThe bewildering number and variety of phonetic values that signs could have in Sumerian led to an unfortunate detour in understanding the language – a Paris-based orientalist, Joseph Halévy, argued from 1874 onward that Sumerian was not a natural language, but rather a secret code (a cryptolect), and for over a decade the leading Assyriologists battled over this issue. For a dozen years, starting in 1885, even the great Friedrich Delitzsch accepted Halévy's arguments, not renouncing Halévy until 1897.\n\nFrançois Thureau-Dangin working at the Louvre in Paris also made significant contributions to deciphering Sumerian with publications from 1898 to 1938, such as his 1905 publication of \"Les inscriptions de Sumer et d'Akkad\". Charles Fossey at the Collège de France in Paris was another prolific and reliable scholar. His pioneering \"Contribution au Dictionnaire sumérien–assyrien\", Paris 1905–1907, turns out to provide the foundation for P. Anton Deimel's 1934 \"Sumerisch-Akkadisches Glossar\" (vol. III of Deimel's 4-volume \"Sumerisches Lexikon\").\n\nIn 1908, Stephen Herbert Langdon summarized the rapid expansion in knowledge of Sumerian and Akkadian vocabulary in the pages of \"Babyloniaca\", a journal edited by Charles Virolleaud, in an article \"Sumerian-Assyrian Vocabularies\", which reviewed a valuable new book on rare logograms by Bruno Meissner. Subsequent scholars have found Langdon's work, including his tablet transcriptions, to be not entirely reliable.\n\nIn 1944, a more careful Sumerologist, Samuel Noah Kramer, provided a detailed and readable summary of the decipherment of Sumerian in his \"Sumerian Mythology\".\n\nFriedrich Delitzsch published a learned Sumerian dictionary and grammar in the form of his \"Sumerisches Glossar\" and \"Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik\", both appearing in 1914. Delitzsch's student, Arno Poebel, published a grammar with the same title, \"Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik\", in 1923, and for 50 years it would be the standard for students studying Sumerian. Poebel's grammar was finally superseded in 1984 on the publication of \"The Sumerian Language: An Introduction to its History and Grammatical Structure\", by Marie-Louise Thomsen. While much of Thomsen's understanding of Sumerian grammar would now be rejected by most or all Sumerologists, Thomsen's grammar (often with express mention of the critiques put forward by Pascal Attinger in his 1993 \"Eléments de linguistique sumérienne: La construction de du/e/di 'dire\") is the starting point of most recent academic discussions of Sumerian grammar.\n\nMore recent monograph-length grammars of Sumerian include Dietz-Otto Edzard's 2003 \"Sumerian Grammar\" and Bram Jagersma's 2010 \"A Descriptive Grammar of Sumerian\" (currently digital, but soon to be printed in revised form by Oxford University Press). Piotr Michalowski's essay (entitled, simply, \"Sumerian\") in the 2004 \"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages\" has also been recognized as a good modern grammatical sketch.\n\nThere is relatively little consensus, even among reasonable Sumerologists, in comparison to the state of most modern or classical languages. Verbal morphology in particular is hotly disputed. In addition to the general grammars, there are many monographs and articles about particular areas of Sumerian grammar, without which a survey of the field could not be considered complete.\n\nThe primary institutional lexical effort in Sumerian is the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary project, begun in 1974. In 2004, the PSD was released on the Web as the ePSD. The project is currently supervised by Steve Tinney. It has not been updated on-line since 2006, but Tinney and colleagues are working on a new edition of the ePSD, a working draft of which is available on-line.\n\nTypologically, as mentioned above, Sumerian is classified as an agglutinative, split-ergative language. Ever since its decipherment, the research of Sumerian has been made difficult not only by the lack of any native speakers, but also by the relative sparseness of linguistic data, the apparent lack of a closely related language, and the features of the writing system.\n\nAssumed phonological or morphological forms will be between slashes //, with plain text used for the standard Assyriological transcription of Sumerian. Most of the following examples are unattested.\n\nModern knowledge of Sumerian phonology is flawed and incomplete because of the lack of native speakers, the transmission through the filter of Akkadian phonology and the difficulties posed by the cuneiform script. As I.M. Diakonoff observes, \"when we try to find out the morphophonological structure of the Sumerian language, we must constantly bear in mind that we are not dealing with a language directly but are reconstructing it from a very imperfect mnemonic writing system which had not been basically aimed at the rendering of morphophonemics\".\n\nSumerian is conjectured to have at least the following consonants:\n\n\nThe existence of various other consonants has been hypothesized based on graphic alternations and loans, though none have found wide acceptance. For example, Diakonoff lists evidence for two l-sounds, two r-sounds, two h-sounds, and two g-sounds (excluding the velar nasal), and assumes a phonemic difference between consonants that are dropped word-finally (such as the \"g\" in zag > za3) and consonants that remain (such as the \"g\" in lag). Other \"hidden\" consonant phonemes that have been suggested include semivowels such as and , and a glottal fricative or a glottal stop that could explain the absence of vowel contraction in some words—though objections have been raised against that as well. A recent descriptive grammar by Bram Jagersma includes , , and as unwritten consonants, with the glottal stop even serving as the first-person pronominal prefix.\n\nVery often, a word-final consonant was not expressed in writing – and was possibly omitted in pronunciation – so it surfaced only when followed by a vowel: for example the /k/ of the genitive case ending -ak does not appear in e lugal-la \"the king's house\", but it becomes obvious in e lugal-la-kam \"(it) is the king's house\" (compare liaison in French).\n\nThe vowels that are clearly distinguished by the cuneiform script are , , , and . Various researchers have posited the existence of more vowel phonemes such as and even and , which would have been concealed by the transmission through Akkadian, as that language does not distinguish them. That would explain the seeming existence of numerous homophones in transliterated Sumerian, as well as some details of the phenomena mentioned in the next paragraph. These hypotheses are not yet generally accepted.\n\nThere is some evidence for vowel harmony according to vowel height or advanced tongue root in the prefix i/e- in inscriptions from pre-Sargonic Lagash, and perhaps even more than one vowel harmony rule. There also appear to be many cases of partial or complete assimilation of the vowel of certain prefixes and suffixes to one in the adjacent syllable reflected in writing in some of the later periods, and there is a noticeable, albeit not absolute, tendency for disyllabic stems to have the same vowel in both syllables. These patterns, too, are interpreted as evidence for a richer vowel inventory by some researchers. What appears to be vowel contraction in hiatus (*/aa/, */ia/, */ua/ > a, */ae/ > a, */ue/ > u, etc.) is also very common.\n\nSyllables could have any of the following structures: V, CV, VC, CVC. More complex syllables, if Sumerian had them, are not expressed as such by the cuneiform script.\n\nThe Sumerian noun is typically a one or two syllable root (\"igi\" \"eye\", \"e\" \"house, household\", \"nin\" \"lady\"), although there are also some roots with three syllables like \"šakanka\" \"market\". There are two grammatical genders, usually called human and non-human (the first includes gods and the word for \"statue\" in some instances, but not plants or animals, the latter also includes collective plural nouns), whose assignment is semantically predictable.\n\nThe adjectives and other modifiers follow the noun (\"lugal maḫ\" \"great king\"). The noun itself is not inflected; rather, grammatical markers attach to the noun phrase as a whole, in a certain order. Typically, that order would be noun – adjective – numeral – genitive phrase – relative clause – possessive marker – plural marker – case marker, for example /dig̃ir gal-gal-g̃u-ne-ra/ (\"god great (reduplicated)-my-plural-dative\" = \"for all my great gods\"). The possessive, plural and case markers are traditionally referred to as \"suffixes\", but have recently also been described as enclitics or postpositions.\n\nThe plural markers are /-(e)ne/ (optional) for nouns of the human gender. Non-human nouns are not marked by a plural suffix. However, plurality can also be expressed with the adjective \"ḫi-a\" \"various\", with the plural of the copula /-meš/, by reduplication of the noun (\"kur-kur\" \"all foreign lands\") or of the following adjective (\"a gal-gal\" \"all the great waters\") (reduplication is believed to signify totality) or by the plurality of only the verb form. Plural reference in the verb form occurs only for human nouns. The case markers are /-Ø/ (absolutive), /-e/ (ergative), /-e/ (allative = \"to\"), /-ak/ (genitive), /-gin/ (equative = \"as, like\"), /-r(a)/ (dative = \"to, for\" = indirect object), /-(e)š(e)/ (traditionally called terminative case, but means \"towards\"), /-da/ (comitative = \"together with\"), /-a/ (locative = \"in, at\"), /-ta/ (ablative = \"from, by\"). Additional spatial or temporal meanings can be expressed by genitive phrases like \"at the head of\" = \"above\", \"at the face of\" = \"in front of\", \"at the outer side of\" = \"because of\" etc.: \"bar udu ḫad-ak-a\" = \"outer.side sheep white-genitive-locative\" = \"in the outer side of a white sheep\" = \"because of a white sheep\".\n\nThe attested independent personal pronouns are written \"g̃e-e\" (1st p. sing.), \"ze-e\" (2nd p. sing.), \"a-ne\" or \"e-ne\" (3rd p. sing. human), and \"a/e-ne-ne\" (3rd p. pl. human). The possessive pronominal morphemes are written \"-g̃u\" (1st p. sing.), \"-zu\" (2nd p. sing.), \"-(a)-n(i)\" (3rd p. sing. human), \"-b(i)\" (3rd p. sing./pl. non-human, also demonstrative and collective), \"-me\" (1st pers. pl.), \"-zu-ne-ne\" (2nd p. pl.), and \"-(a)-ne-ne\" (3rd pers.pl. animate). For most of the suffixes, vowels are subject to loss if they are attached to vowel-final words.\n\nThe embedded structure of the noun phrase can be illustrated with the phrase \"sipad udu siki-ak-ak-ene\" (\"the shepherds of woolly sheep\"), where the first genitive morpheme (\"-a(k)\") subordinates \"siki\" \"wool\" to \"udu\" \"sheep\", and the second subordinates \"udu siki-a(k)\" \"sheep of wool\" (or \"woolly sheep\") to \"sipad\" \"shepherd\".\n\nThe Sumerian finite verb distinguishes a number of moods and agrees (more or less consistently) with the subject and the object in person, number and gender. The verb chain may also incorporate pronominal references to the verb's other modifiers, which has also traditionally been described as \"agreement\", although, in fact, such a reference \"and\" the presence of an actual modifier in the clause need not co-occur: not only e-še ib-ši-du-un \"I'm going to the house\", but also e-še i-du-un \"I'm going to the house\" and simply ib-ši-du-un \"I'm going to it\" are possible.\n\nThe Sumerian verb also makes a binary distinction according to a category that some regard as tense (past vs present-future), others as aspect (perfective vs imperfective), and that will be designated as TA (tense/aspect) in the following. The two members of the opposition entail different conjugation patterns and, at least for many verbs, different stems; they are theory-neutrally referred to with the Akkadian grammatical terms for the two respective forms – \"ḫamṭu\" (quick) and \"marû\" (slow, fat). Finally, opinions differ on whether the verb has a passive or a middle voice and how it is expressed.\n\nThe verbal root is almost always a monosyllable and, together with various affixes, forms a so-called verbal chain which is described as a sequence of about 15 slots, though the precise models differ. The finite verb has both prefixes and suffixes, while the non-finite verb may only have suffixes. Broadly, the prefixes have been divided in three groups that occur in the following order: modal prefixes, \"conjugation prefixes\", and pronominal and dimensional prefixes. The suffixes are a future or imperfective marker /-ed-/, pronominal suffixes, and an /-a/ ending that nominalizes the whole verb chain.\n\nThe modal prefixes are :\n\nTheir meaning can depend on the TA.\n\nThe meaning, structure, identity and even the number of \"conjugation prefixes\" have always been a subject of disagreements. The term \"conjugation prefix\" simply alludes to the fact that a finite verb in the indicative mood must always contain one of them. Some of their most frequent expressions in writing are mu-, i- (ED Lagaš variant: e-), ba-, bi- (ED Lagaš: bi- or be), im-, im-ma- (ED Lagaš e-ma-), im-mi- (ED Lagaš i-mi or e-me-), mi- (always followed by pronominal-dimensional -ni-) and al-, and to a lesser extent a-, am-, am-ma-, and am-mi-; virtually all analyses attempt to describe many of the above as combinations or allomorphs of each other. The starting point of most analyses are the obvious facts that the 1st person dative always requires mu-, and that the verb in a \"passive\" clause without an overt agent tends to have ba-. Proposed explanations usually revolve around the subtleties of spatial grammar, information structure (focus), verb valency, and, most recently, voice. Mu-, im- and am- have been described as ventive morphemes, while ba- and bi- are sometimes analyzed as actually belonging to the pronominal-dimensional group (inanimate pronominal /-b-/ + dative /-a-/ or directive /-i-/). Im-ma-, im-mi-, am-ma- and am-mi- are then considered by some as a combination of the ventive and /ba-/, /bi-/ or otherwise a variety of the ventive. I- has been argued to be a mere prothetic vowel, al- a stative prefix, ba- a middle voice prefix, etcetera.\n\nThe dimensional prefixes of the verb chain basically correspond to, and often repeat, the case markers of the noun phrase. Like the latter, they are attached to a \"head\" – a pronominal prefix. The other place where a pronominal prefix can be placed is immediately before the stem, where it can have a different allomorph and expresses the absolutive or the ergative participant (the transitive subject, the intransitive subject or the direct object), depending on the TA and other factors, as explained below. However, this neat system is obscured by the tendency to drop or merge many of the prefixes in writing and possibly in pronunciation as well. -da-, -ta-, -ši- (early -še-), occurring in this order, are the comitative, ablative and terminative verbal prefixes; the dative (occurring before the others) is probably /-a-/, and a directive /-i-/ (occurring after the others) is widely recognized as well. The pronominal prefixes are /-n-/ and /-b-/ for the 3rd person singular animate and inanimate respectively; the 2nd person singular appears as -e- in most contexts, but as /-r-/ before the dative (-ra-), leading some to assume a phonetic /-ir-/ or /-jr-/. The 1st person may appear as -e-, too, but is more commonly not expressed at all (the same may frequently apply to 3rd and 2nd persons); it is, however, cued by the choice of mu- as conjugation prefix (/mu-/ + /-a-/ → ma-). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd plural infixes are -me-,-re?- and -ne- in the dative and perhaps in other contexts as well, though not in the pre-stem position (see below). An additional exception from the system is the prefix -ni- which corresponds to a noun phrase in the locative – in which case it doesn't seem to be preceded by a pronominal prefix – and, according to Gábor Zólyomi and others, to an animate one in the directive – in the latter case it is analyzed as pronominal /-n-/ + directive /-i-/. Zólyomi and others also believe that special meanings can be expressed by combinations of non-identical noun case and verb prefix. Also according to some researchers /-ni-/ and /bi-/ acquire the forms /-n-/ and /-b-/ (coinciding with the \"absolutive–ergative\" pronominal prefixes) before the stem if there isn't already an absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in pre-stem position: mu-un-kur = /mu-ni-kur/ \"he went in there\" (as opposed to mu-ni-kur = mu-ni-in-kur = /mu-ni-n-kur/ \"he brought in – caused [something or someone] to go in – there\".\n\nThe pronominal suffixes are /-en/ for the first- and second-person singular, /-e/ for the third singular in \"marû\" TA and /-Ø/ in \"ḫamṭu\" TA, /-enden/ for the first plural, /-enzen/ for the second plural, /-ene/ for the third plural in \"marû\" and /-eš/ in \"ḫamṭu\" (the initial vowel in all of the above suffixes can be assimilated to the root). The general principle for pronominal agreement in conjugation is that in \"ḫamṭu\" TA, the transitive subject is expressed by the prefix, and the direct object by the suffix, and in the \"marû\" TA it is the other way round; as for the intransitive subject, it is expressed, in both TAs, by the suffixes and is thus treated like the object in \"ḫamṭu\" and like the subject in \"marû\" (except that its third person is expressed, not only in \"ḫamṭu\" but also in \"marû\", by the suffixes used for the \"object\" in the \"ḫamṭu\" TA). A major exception from this generalization are the plural forms – in them, not only the prefix (as in the singular), but also the suffix expresses the transitive subject. Additionally, the prefixes of the plural are identical to those of the singular – /-?-/ or /-e-/, /-e-/, /-n-/, /-b-/ – as opposed to the -me-, -re-?, -ne- that are presumed for non-pre-stem position – and some scholars believe that the prefixes of the 1st and second person are /-en-/ rather than /-e-/ when they stand for the object. Before the pronominal suffixes, a suffix /-e(d)-/ with a future or related modal meaning can be inserted, accounting for occurrences of -e in the third-person singular \"marû\" of intransitive forms; because of its meaning, it can also be said to signal \"marû\" in these forms.\n\nExamples for TA and pronominal agreement: (\"ḫamṭu\" is rendered with past tense, \"marû\" with present): /i-gub-en/ (\"I stood\" or \"I stand\"), /i-n-gub-en/ (\"he placed me\" or \"I place him\"); /i-sug-enden/ (\"we stood/stand\"); /i-n-dim-enden/ (\"he created us\" or \"we create him\"); /mu-e?-dim-enden/ (\"we created [someone or something]\"); i-gub-be = /i-gub-ed/ (\"he will/must stand\"); ib-gub-be = /i-b-gub-e/ (\"he places it\"); /i-b-dim-ene/ (\"they create it\"), /i-n-dim-eš/ (\"they created [someone or something]\" or \"he created them\"), /i-sug-eš/ (\"they stood\" or \"they stand\").\n\nConfusingly, the subject and object prefixes (/-n-/, /-b-/, /-e-/) are not commonly spelled out in early texts, although the \"full\" spellings do become more usual during the Third Dynasty of Ur (in the Neo-Sumerian period) and especially during the Late Sumerian period. Thus, in earlier texts, one finds mu-ak and i-ak (e-ak in early dynastic Lagash) instead of mu-un-ak and in-ak for /mu-n-ak/ and /i-n-ak/ \"he/she made\", and also mu-ak instead of mu-e-ak \"you made\". Similarly, pre-Ur III texts also spell the first- and second-person suffix /-en/ as -e, making it coincide with the third person in the \"marû\" form.\n\nThe verbal stem itself can also express grammatical distinctions. The plurality of the absolutive participant can be expressed by complete reduplication of the stem or by a suppletive stem. Reduplication can also express \"plurality of the action itself\", intensity or iterativity. With respect to TA marking, verbs are divided in 4 types; \"ḫamṭu\" is always the unmarked TA. The stems of the 1st type, regular verbs, do not express TA at all according to most scholars, or, according to M. Yoshikawa and others, express \"marû\" TA by adding an (assimilating) /-e-/ as in gub-be or gub-bu vs gub (which is, however, nowhere distinguishable from the first vowel of the pronominal suffixes except for intransitive \"marû\" 3rd person singular). The 2nd type express \"marû\" by partial reduplication of the stem as kur vs ku-ku; the 3rd type express \"marû\" by adding a consonant (te vs teg̃); and the 4th type use a suppletive stem (dug vs e). Thus, as many as four different suppletive stems can exist, as in the admittedly extreme case of the verb \"to go\": g̃en (\"to go\", \"ḫamṭu\" sing.), du (\"marû\" sing.), (e-)re (\"ḫamṭu\" plur.), sub (\"marû\" plur.)\n\nThe nominalizing suffix /-a/ converts non-finite and finite verbs into participles and relative clauses: sum-ma \"given\", mu-na-an-sum-ma \"which he gave to him\", \"who gave (something) to him\", etc.. Adding /-a/ after the future/modal suffix /-ed/ produces a form with a meaning similar to the Latin gerundive: sum-mu-da = \"which will/should be given\". On the other hand, adding a (locative-terminative?) /-e/ after the /-ed/ yields a form with a meaning similar to the Latin \"ad\" + gerund (acc.) construction: sum-mu-de = \"(in order) to give\".\n\nThe copula verb /me/ \"to be\" is mostly used as an enclitic: -men, -men, -am, -menden, -menzen, -(a)meš.\n\nThe imperative mood construction is produced with a singular \"ḫamṭu\" stem, but using the \"marû\" agreement pattern, by turning all prefixes into suffixes: mu-na-an-sum \"he gave (something) to him\", mu-na-e-sum-mu-un-ze-en \"you (plur.) gave (something) to him\" – sum-mu-na-ab \"give it to him!\", sum-mu-na-ab-ze-en \"give (plur.) it to him!\" Compare the French \"tu le lui donnes\", \"vous le lui donnez\" (present tense) – \"donne-le-lui!\", \"donnez-le-lui!\"\n\nThe basic word order is subject–object–verb; verb finality is only violated in rare instances, in poetry. The moving of a constituent towards the beginning of the phrase may be a way to highlight it, as may the addition of the copula to it. The so-called anticipatory genitive (e-a lugal-bi \"the owner of the house/temple\", lit. \"of the house, its owner\") is common and may signal the possessor's topicality. There are various ways to express subordination, some of which have already been hinted at; they include the nominalization of a verb, which can then be followed by case morphemes and possessive pronouns (kur9-ra-ni \"when he entered\") and included in \"prepositional\" constructions (eg̃er a-ma-ru ba-ur-ra-ta \"back – flood – conjugation prefix – sweep over – nominalizing suffix – [genitive suffix?] – ablative suffix\" = \"from the back of the Flood's sweeping-over\" = \"after the Flood had swept over\"). Subordinating conjunctions such as ud-da \"when, if\", tukum-bi \"if\" are also used, though the coordinating conjunction u \"and\", a Semitic adoption, is rarely used. A specific problem of Sumerian syntax is posed by the numerous so-called compound verbs, which usually involve a noun immediately before the verb, forming a lexical or idiomatic unit (e.g. šu...ti, lit. \"hand-approach\" = \"receive\"; igi...du, lit. \"eye-open\" = \"see\"). Some of them are claimed to have a special agreement pattern that they share with causative constructions: their logical object, like the causee, receives, in the verb, the directive infix, but in the noun, the dative suffix if animate and the directive if inanimate.\n\nThis text was inscribed on a small clay cone c. 2400 BC.

{"id": "3586665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3586665", "title": "Vyākaraṇa", "text": "Vyākaraṇa\n\nVyākaraṇa (Sanskrit: \"explanation, analysis\") refers to one of the six ancient Vedangas, ancillary science connected with the Vedas, which are scriptures in Hinduism. Vyākaraṇa is the study of Sanskrit.\n\nPāṇini and Yāska are the two celebrated ancient scholars of Vyākaraṇa; both are dated to several centuries prior to the start of the common era, with Pāṇini likely from the fifth century BCE. Pāṇini's \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" is the most important surviving text of the Vyākaraṇa traditions. This text consists of eight chapters, each divided into four padas, cumulatively containing 4000 sutras. The text is preceded by abbreviation rules grouping the phonemes of Sanskrit. Pāṇini quotes ten ancient authorities whose texts have not survived, but they are believed to have been Vyākaraṇa scholars.\n\nVyākaraṇa is related to the fourth Vedanga called \"Nirukta\". Vyākaraṇa scholarship has dealt with linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words to properly express ideas, and \"Nirukta\" scholarship has focussed on linguistic analysis to help establish the proper meaning of the words in context.\n\nVyākaraṇa () means \"separation, distinction, discrimination, analysis, explanation\" of something. It also refers to one of the six Vedangas, or the Vedic field of language analysis, specifically grammatical analysis, grammar, linguistic conventions which creates, polishes, helps a writer express and helps a reader discriminate accurate language.\n\nThe word Vyākaraṇa is also found in Mahayana sutras and first millennium Mahayana Buddhist texts, but with a different meaning. Vyākaraṇa, in these Buddhist texts, means a prediction or prophecy by a buddha to a bodhisattva who has just embarked on the path, that he will achieve enlightenment and be a buddha.\n\nVyākaraṇa emerged as a distinct auxiliary field of Vedic study in ancient times. Its aim was to prevent sloppy usage and transmission of the Vedic knowledge, states Howard Coward – a professor emeritus at the University of Victoria and the founding editor of the \"Journal for Hindu-Christian Studies\". Vyākaraṇa helped ensure that the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism and its message of \"Sabda Brahman\" (explanation of metaphysical truths through words) that Vedic Rishis had realized by their efforts, remains available to all in a pristine form. In Indian traditions, Vyākaraṇa has been one of the most important sciences, one extensively studied over its history, and that led to major treatises in the philosophy of language.\n\nPāṇini and Yāska, two celebrated ancient scholars of Vyākaraṇa, are both dated to several centuries prior to the start of the common era, likely the 5th-century BCE. However, both of them cite prior scholars and texts, which though lost to history, imply that the field of Vyākaraṇa was an established and developed science of language before them. Between the two, Yaksa may be the older one and more known for \"Nirukta\" (etymology) – the fourth auxiliary field of Vedic studies, but the evidence for him preceding Pāṇini is scanty and uncertain. In terms of dedicated treatise on Vyākaraṇa, Pāṇini is the most recognized ancient Hindu scholar, and his \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" (\"Eight Chapters\") is the most studied extant ancient manuscript on Sanskrit grammar. Pāṇini's fame spread outside India, and the reverence for ancient Pāṇini in northwest India is mentioned in Chinese texts of Xuanzang – the 7th-century traveller and scholar.\n\nThe study of grammar and the structure of language is traceable to the Rigveda, or 2nd millennium BCE, in hymns attributed to sage Sakalya. Sakalya is acknowledged by Pāṇini's works. The literary evidence that the science of Vyākaraṇa existed in Vedic times abound in the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads, states Moriz Winternitz. The extant manuscripts of Pāṇini and Yaksa suggest that the Vedic age had competing schools of grammar. One school, for example, held that all nouns have verbal roots, while another held that not all nouns have verbal roots. However, it is unclear how, who or when these ancient Vedic theories of grammar originated, because those texts have not survived into the modern era.\n\nThere were many schools of Sanskrit grammar in ancient India, all established before the mid 1st-millennium BCE. Pāṇini's \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" , which eclipsed all other ancient schools of grammar, mentions the names of ten grammarians.). Some of these pre-Pāṇinian scholars mentioned by Pāṇini include Apisali, Kasyapa, Gargya, Galava, Cakravarmana, Bharadvaja, Sakatayana, Sakalya, Senaka and Sphoṭayāna.\n\nThe works of most these authors are lost but we find reference of their ideas in the commentaries and rebuttals by later authors. Yāska's \"Nirukta\" is one of the earlier surviving texts, and he mentions Śākaṭāyana, Krauṣṭuki, Gārgya among others.\n\nPāṇini's \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" is the most ancient extant manuscript on Vyākaraṇa. It is a complete and descriptive treatise on Sanskrit grammar in aphoristic sutras format. This text attracted a famous and one of the most ancient bhāṣya (commentary) called the \"Mahābhāṣya\". The author of the \"Mahābhāṣya\" is named Patañjali, who may or may not be the same person as the one who authored the \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\". The \"Mahābhāṣya\", literally \"great commentary\", is more than a commentary on Aṣṭādhyāyī. It is, states Howard Coward, the earliest known philosophical text of the Hindu Grammarians. Non-Hindu texts and traditions on grammar emerged after Patañjali, some of which include the Sanskrit grammar text of Jainendra of Jainism and the Chandra school of Buddhism.\nLater Indian scholars simplified Pāṇini rules, and trimmed his compilation of sutras to essential 1,400 from comprehensive 4,000, eliminating those they felt were too difficult and complicated. Non-Hindu traditions, such as Jainism and Buddhism, developed their own Vyākaraṇa literature, but all of them are dated to the 1st-millennium CE, all of them condensed Pāṇini, accepted and flowered largely from his theories of Vyākaraṇa.\nThe 5th-century Hindu scholar Bhartṛhari has been the next most influential Vyākaraṇa thinker, wherein he presented his philosophy of grammar and how language affects thoughts. His theories on \"philosophical problem of meaning\", contained in the \"Vākyapadīya\", has been unique, states Howard Coward. Bhartṛhari is considered to be a major architect of the \"sphoṭa theory\" of meaning, in the Hindu traditions.\n\nBhartṛhari ideas were widely studied, but challenged as well in the last half of the first millennium, particularly by the ritual-driven, Mīmāṃsā school of Hindu philosophy and by Dharmakirti of Buddhism. The Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism defended the ideas of Bhartṛhari.\n\nAbout the seventh century, the \"Kāśikāvṛttī\" co-authored by Jayaditya and Vamana, and the tenth century studies of Helaraja on Vyākaraṇa were the next major milestone. These Hindu texts were not only commented in Hindu tradition, but were the foundation of works of the Buddhist \"Jinendrabuddhi\" who is known for his grammar insights in Buddhist literature.\n\nThe most studied Vyākaraṇa scholars of early and mid-second millennium are Ksirasvamin, Haradatta, Maitreya Rakshita, and Kaiyata. The modern era Vyākaraṇa scholars have included Bhattoji Dikshita, Konda Bhatta and Nagesha Bhatta.\n\nIn terms of the place of Vyākaraṇa scholarship over South Asian history, from ancient to 16th-century, Kashmir, Kerala, Nepal, Andhra Pradesh, Varanasi and Bengal have been influential, but the location of many Vyākaraṇa scholars is unknown.\n\nPāṇini's text \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" is in sutras format, has eight chapters, and cumulative total of 4,000 sutras. These rules are preceded by a list of fourteen groups of sounds, in three sections called the Shiva-sutra, Pratyahara-sutra and Maheshvara-sutra. The \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" groups the rules of language, for clear expression and understanding, into two, the verbal (\"Dhatupatha\") and the nominal bases (\"Ganapatha\"). The text consists of an analytical part covered in the first five chapters, and a synthetic part found in the last three chapters.\n\nThe \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" manuscript has survived with sets of ancillary texts (appendices) whose dates of composition and authors are contested. The main text is notable for its details and systematic nature, syntactic functions and arranging the sutras in an algorithmic fashion where the grammar rules typically apply in the order of sutras.\n\nThe \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" sutras were widely studied and a subject of the \"bhāṣya\" (review and commentary) tradition of Hinduism. The oldest emendation and commentary on the \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" is attributed to Kātyāyana (~3rd century BCE), followed by the famous \"Mahābhāṣya\" of Patañjali (~2nd century BCE) which has survived into the modern age. Other commentaries on the \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" likely existed, because they are cited by other Indian scholars, but these texts are believed to be lost to history.\n\nPāṇini writes that the \"Anjna\" (popular usage of a word) is the superseding authority, and the theoretically derived meaning of a word must be discarded and instead superseded by that which is the popular usage. The \"artha\" (meaning) of a \"shabda\" (word) is established by popular usage at the time the text was composed, not by etymological theory nor historical usage nor later usage.\n\nA sentence is a collection of words, a word is a collection of phonemes, states Pāṇini. The meaning of Vedic passages has to be understood through context, the purpose stated, keeping in mind the subject matter being discussed, what is stated, how, where and when.\n\nThe \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" tradition of Sanskrit language, with some reservations, accepts the premise that all words have verbal roots, and that words are created by affixing fragments to these roots. However, Pāṇini asserts that it is impossible to derive all nouns from verbal roots.\n\nThe \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" is primarily focussed on the study of words, how words are formed, and their correct architecture. However, it does not exclude syntax. Pāṇini includes the discussion of sentence structure. The text, state Howard and Raja, describes compound word formation based on syntactic and semantic considerations, such as in sutra 2.1.1.\n\nPāṇini asserts that a proper sentence has a single purpose, and is formed from a group of words such that, on analysis, the separate words are found to be mutually expecting each other. A sentence, states Pāṇini, must have syntactic unity, which includes mutual expectancy (\"Akansha\") of the words and phonetic contiguity (\"Sannidhi\") of construction. Pāṇini adds semantic fitness (\"Yogayata\"), but not tacitly. He accepts that a sentence can be grammatically correct even if it is semantically inappropriate or a deviant.\n\nThe \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" describes numerous usage of words, and how the meaning of a word is driven by overall context of the sentences and composition it is found in. The popular usage and meaning of a word at the time the text was composed supersedes the historical or etymologically derived meanings of that word. A word has the conventional meaning at the time the text was composed, but it is not so when it is quoted (cited or referred to) from another prior art text. In the latter case, the Sanskrit word is suffixed with \"iti\" (literally, thus), wherein it means what the prior text meant it to be.\n\nYāska asserted that both the meaning and the etymology of words is always context dependent.\n\nVyākaraṇa in the Hindu traditions has been a study of both the syntax structure of sentences, as well as the architecture of a word. For instance, Pāṇini asserts that grammar is about the means of semantically connecting a word with other words to express and understand meaning, and words are to be analyzed in the context they are used. Kātyāyana is quoted in Patañjali's \"Mahābhāṣya\" on Vyākaraṇa as asserting the nature of a sentence as follows:\nSimilarly, Sayana asserts the scope of Vyākaraṇa to be as follows:\nA word that is a verb is concerned with \"bhava\" (to become), while a noun is concerned with \"sattva\" (to be, reality as it is). Sattva and bhava are two aspects of the same existence seen from the static and dynamic points of view. Verbs according to Vyākaraṇa indicate action in a temporal sequence while nouns are static elements, states K Kunjunni Raja.\n\nPatañjali's 2nd-century BCE \"Mahābhāṣya\" is another important ancient text in Vyākaraṇa scholarship. It not a full commentary on everything Pāṇini wrote in \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\", but it is more a commentary on Kātyāyana's text on grammar called \"Varttikas\", as well as the ideas of Vyadi. While Kātyāyana's additions have survived, Vyadi have not.\n\nThe Kātyāyana's text reflects an admiration for Pāṇini, an analysis of his rules, their simplification and refinement. The differences between the grammar rules of Pāṇini and of Kātyāyana may be because of historical changes to Sanskrit language over the centuries, state Howard Coward and K Kunjunni Raja.\n\nThe \"Vākyapadīya\" of Bhartṛhari is a treatise on the philosophy of language, building on the insights of prior Vyākaraṇa scholarship.\n\nAccording to Bhartṛhari, states Scharfstein, all thought and all knowledge are \"words\", every word has an outward expression and inward meaning. A word may have a definition in isolation but it has meaning only in the context of a sentence. Grammar is a basic science in the Hindu traditions, explains Scharfstein, where it is externally expressed as relations between words, but ultimately internally understood as reflecting relations between the different levels of reality. Word is considered a form of energy in this Hindu text, one with the potential to transform a latent mind and realize the soul. Language evolves to express the transient material world first, and thereon to express feelings, the human desire for meaning in life and the spiritual inner world.\n\nIn Yāska's time, \"nirukta\" \"etymology\" was in fact a school which gave information of formation of words, the etymological derivation of words. According to the \"nairuktas\" or \"etymologists\", all nouns are derived from a verbal root. Yāska defends this view and attributes it to Śākaṭāyana. While others believed that there are some words which are \"Rudhi Words\". 'Rudhi\" means custom. Meaning they are a part of language due to custom, and a correspondence between the word and the thing if it be a noun or correspondence between an act and the word if it be a verb root. Such word can not be derived from verbal roots.\nYāska also reports the view of Gārgya, who opposed Śākaṭāyana who held that certain nominal stems were 'atomic' and not to be derived from verbal roots\n\nThe Vyākaraṇa texts have been highly influential on Hindu philosophies. The concept of a sentence (\"vakya\") defined by Pāṇini, for instance, influenced and was similar to Jaimini, the later era founder of Mīmāṃsā school of Hindu philosophy. However, ritual-focussed Mimamsa school scholars were generally opposed to central ideas of the Hindu Grammarians, while others Hindu schools such as Vedanta championed them.\n\nPāṇini's work on Vyākaraṇa has been called by George Cardona as \"one of the greatest monuments of human intelligence\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1449866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1449866", "title": "Word", "text": "Word\n\nIn linguistics, a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning. \n\nThis contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\"), or several (\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are \"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\").\nA complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (\"rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed\"), or more than one root in a compound (\"black-board, sand-box\"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (\"a red rock\", \"put up with\"), clauses (\"I threw a rock\"), and sentences (\"He threw a rock too, but he missed\").\n\nThe term \"word\" may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either. Spoken words are made up of units of sound called phonemes, and written words of symbols called graphemes, such as the letters of the English alphabet.\n\nThe difficulty of deciphering a word depends on the language. Dictionaries categorize a language's lexicon (i.e., its vocabulary) into lemmas. These can be taken as an indication of what constitutes a \"word\" in the opinion of the writers of that language. The most appropriate means of measuring the length of a word is by counting its syllables or morphemes. When a word has multiple definitions or multiple senses, it may result in confusion in a debate or discussion.\n\nLeonard Bloomfield introduced the concept of \"Minimal Free Forms\" in 1926. Words are thought of as the smallest meaningful unit of speech that can stand by themselves. This correlates phonemes (units of sound) to lexemes (units of meaning). However, some written words are not minimal free forms as they make no sense by themselves (for example, \"the\" and \"of\").\n\nSome semanticists have put forward a theory of so-called semantic primitives or semantic primes, indefinable words representing fundamental concepts that are intuitively meaningful. According to this theory, semantic primes serve as the basis for describing the meaning, without circularity, of other words and their associated conceptual denotations.\n\nIn the Minimalist school of theoretical syntax, words (also called \"lexical items\" in the literature) are construed as \"bundles\" of linguistic features that are united into a structure with form and meaning. For example, the word \"koalas\" has semantic features (it denotes real-world objects, koalas), category features (it is a noun), number features (it is plural and must agree with verbs, pronouns, and demonstratives in its domain), phonological features (it is pronounced a certain way), etc.\n\nThe task of defining what constitutes a \"word\" involves determining where one word ends and another word begins—in other words, identifying word boundaries. There are several ways to determine where the word boundaries of spoken language should be placed:\n\nIn languages with a literary tradition, there is interrelation between orthography and the question of what is considered a single word. Word separators (typically spaces) are common in modern orthography of languages using alphabetic scripts, but these are (excepting isolated precedents) a relatively modern development (see also history of writing).\n\nIn English orthography, compound expressions may contain spaces. For example, \"ice cream\", \"air raid shelter\" and \"get up\" each are generally considered to consist of more than one word (as each of the components are free forms, with the possible exception of \"get\").\n\nNot all languages delimit words expressly. Mandarin Chinese is a very analytic language (with few inflectional affixes), making it unnecessary to delimit words orthographically. However, there are many multiple-morpheme compounds in Mandarin, as well as a variety of bound morphemes that make it difficult to clearly determine what constitutes a word.\n\nSometimes, languages which are extremely close grammatically will consider the same order of words in different ways. For example, reflexive verbs in the French infinitive are separate from their respective particle, e.g. \"se laver\" (\"to wash oneself\"), whereas in Portuguese they are hyphenated, e.g. \"lavar-se\", and in Spanish they are joined, e.g. \"lavarse\".\n\nJapanese uses orthographic cues to delimit words such as switching between kanji (Chinese characters) and the two kana syllabaries. This is a fairly soft rule, because content words can also be written in hiragana for effect (though if done extensively spaces are typically added to maintain legibility).\n\nVietnamese orthography, although using the Latin alphabet, delimits monosyllabic morphemes rather than words.\n\nIn character encoding, word segmentation depends on which characters are defined as word dividers.\n\nMorphology is the study of word formation and structure. In synthetic languages, a single word stem (for example, \"love\") may have a number of different forms (for example, \"loves\", \"loving\", and \"loved\"). However, for some purposes these are not usually considered to be different words, but rather different forms of the same word. In these languages, words may be considered to be constructed from a number of morphemes.\n\nIn Indo-European languages in particular, the morphemes distinguished are\nThus, the Proto-Indo-European \" would be analyzed as consisting of\n\nPhilosophers have found words objects of fascination since at least the 5th century BC, with the foundation of the philosophy of language. Plato analyzed words in terms of their origins and the sounds making them up, concluding that there was some connection between sound and meaning, though words change a great deal over time. John Locke wrote that the use of words \"is to be sensible marks of ideas\", though they are chosen \"not by any natural connexion that there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas, for then there would be but one language amongst all men; but by a voluntary imposition, whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of such an idea\". Wittgenstein's thought transitioned from a word as representation of meaning to \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\"\n\nArchaeology shows that even for centuries prior to this fascination by philosophers in the 5th century BC, many languages had various ways of expressing this verbal unit, which in turn diversified and evolved into a range of expressions with wide philosophical significance. Ancient manuscripts of the Gospel of John reveal in its 5th chapter the Rabonni Y'shua chastising the pharisees expecting to find life in writings instead of himself. This perhaps could have led to John's introduction in chapter of a description in the Greek translation as \"the logos\". A famous early scientist, scholar and priest, Thomas Aquinas, influenced Cartesian philosophy and mathematics by interpreting such passages consistently with his philosophy of logic.\n\nGrammar classifies a language's lexicon into several groups of words. The basic bipartite division possible for virtually every natural language is that of nouns vs. verbs.\n\nThe classification into such classes is in the tradition of Dionysius Thrax, who distinguished eight categories: noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, preposition, adverb, conjunction and interjection.\n\nIn Indian grammatical tradition, Pāṇini introduced a similar fundamental classification into a nominal (nāma, suP) and a verbal (ākhyāta, tiN) class, based on the set of suffixes taken by the word. Some words can be controversial such as slang in formal contexts, misnomers due to them not meaning what they would imply or polysemous words due to the potential confusion of its multiple senses.\n\n\n"}
