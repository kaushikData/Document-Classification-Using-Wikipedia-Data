In the circle of Lipps' students he came in contact with Moritz Geiger, Otto Selz, Aloys Fischer and above all Johannes Daubert. From onward 1903/4 he was increasingly busy with the works of Edmund Husserl, especially his \"Logische Untersuchungen\" (Logical Investigations).\n\nIn 1904, Reinach obtained his doctorate in philosophy under Lipps with his work \"Über den Ursachenbegriff im geltenden Strafrecht\" (On the concept of cause in penal law). In 1905, he still intended to continue his studies in Munich (where in the meanwhile he had also befriended Alexander Pfänder), to obtain a degree in law, but then decided to go to study with Husserl in Göttingen. In that period more students of Lipps (captained by Daubert) had decided to abandon Munich and to head for Göttingen, inspired by Husserl's works (which is referred to as the Munich invasion of Göttingen).\n\nLater in 1905 Reinach returned to Munich to complete his studies in law and then continued in 1906-1907 in Tübingen. He attended several lectures and seminars on penal law by the legal theorist Ernst Beling, by which he was quite impressed and to which he owes a great deal of inspiration of his later works. In the summer of 1907 he took the First State Examination in Law, but also went later to Göttingen to attend discussion circles with Husserl.\n\nWith the support of Husserl, Reinach was able to obtain habilitation for university teaching at Göttingen in 1909. From his lectures and research, we can see that at the time he was influenced also by Anton Marty and Johannes Daubert, besides obviously and greatly by Husserl. On his turn Reinach appears to have inspired several young phenomenologists (like Wilhelm Schapp, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Alexandre Koyré and Edith Stein) with his lectures. Besides giving an introduction to phenomenology, he lectured i.a. on Plato and Immanuel Kant.\n\nIn this period, Husserl embarked on a thorough revision of his main work, the \"Logical Investigations\", and asked Reinach’s assistance in this endeavour. Moreover, in 1912 Reinach, together with Moritz Geiger and Alexander Pfänder founded the famous \"Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung\", with Husserl as main editor.\n\nBesides his work in the area of phenomenology and philosophy in general, Reinach is credited for the development of a forerunner to the theory of speech acts by Austin and Searle: \"Die apriorischen Grundlagen des bürgerlichen Rechtes\" (The A Priori Foundations of Civil Law) is a systematic treatment of social acts as performative utterances and \"a priori\" foundations of civil law. Reinach's work was based mostly on Husserl's analysis of meaning in the \"Logical Investigations\", but also on Daubert's criticism of it. Alexander Pfänder (1870–1941) had also been doing research on commands, promises and the like in the same period.\n\nAfter Husserl's publication of the \"Ideen\" (Ideas) in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories and the current of Munich phenomenology came effectively into being, as Reinach, Daubert and others chose to remain closer to Husserl's earlier work, the \"Logical investigations\". Instead of following Husserl into idealism and transcendental phenomenology, the Munich group remained a realist current.\n\nReinach was converted to Lutheranism along with his wife\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I Reinach volunteered to join the army. After many battles and having received the Iron Cross, Reinach fell outside Diksmuide in Flanders on 16 November 1917.\n\n\nHis collected works: \"Sämtliche Werke.

At this time she had worked as a nurse for twenty years, and although she still enjoyed her occupation, she felt it was time to try something new. Jansson commented: \"In school I hated writing essays, but then we got a computer at home, and suddenly I discovered that I actually felt happy as I was writing.\" A contributing factor to Jansson's decision to pursue her career as an author was her patients; she often met patients that were about to die and she was told that they regretted the fact that they had not spent much time in life doing what they really wanted.\n\nThe inspiration for Jansson's novels, which deal with crimes, came from the patients she met in her job as a nurse. Jansson's first crime novel to be published was \"Stum sitter guden\" in 2000. She had written two novels prior to this one, but failed to find a publisher for them. Jansson did not give up on her career as a nurse, and continued to work part-time at the Örebro Hospital while writing in her free time. Since 2000, she has published at least one novel each year.

By synchronizing an oscillator with the colorburst at the back porch (beginning) of each scan line, a television receiver is able to restore the suppressed carrier of the chrominance (color) signals, and in turn decode the color information. The most common use of colorburst is to genlock equipment together as a common reference with a vision mixer in a television studio using a multi-camera setup.\n\nIn NTSC, its frequency is exactly 315/88 = 3.579 MHz with a phase of 180°. PAL uses a frequency of exactly 4.43361875 MHz, with its phase alternating between 135° and 225° from line to line. Since the colorburst signal has a known amplitude, it is sometimes used as a reference level when compensating for amplitude variations in the overall signal.\n\nSECAM is unique in not having a colorburst signal, since the chrominance signals are encoded using FM rather than QAM, thus the signal phase is immaterial and no reference point is needed.\n\nThe original black and white NTSC television standard specified a frame rate of 30 Hz and 525 lines per frame, or 15750 lines per second. The audio was frequency modulated 4.5 MHz above the video signal. Because this was black and white, the video consisted only of luminance (brightness) information. Although all of the space in between was occupied, the line-based nature of the video information meant that the luminance data was not spread uniformly across the frequency domain; it was concentrated at multiples of the line rate. Plotting the video signal on a spectrogram gave a signature that looked like the teeth of a comb or a gear, rather than smooth and uniform.\n\nRCA discovered that if the chrominance (color) information, which had a similar spectrum, was modulated on a carrier that was a half-integer multiple of the line rate, its signal peaks would fit neatly between the peaks of the luminance data and interference was minimized. It was not eliminated, but what remained was not readily apparent to human eyes. (Modern televisions attempt to reduce this interference further using a comb filter.)\n\nTo provide sufficient bandwidth for the chrominance signal, yet interfere only with the highest-frequency (and thus least perceptible) portions of the luminance signal, a chrominance subcarrier near 3.6 MHz was desirable. 227.5 = 455/2 times the line rate was close to the right number, and 455's small factors (5 × 7 × 13) make a divider easy to construct.\n\nHowever, additional interference could come from the audio signal. To minimize interference there, it was similarly desirable to make the distance between the chrominance carrier frequency and the audio carrier frequency a half-integer multiple of the line rate. The sum of these two half-integers implies that the distance between the frequency of the luminance carrier and audio carrier must be an integer multiple of the line rate. However, the original NTSC standard, with a 4.5 MHz carrier spacing and a 15750 Hz line rate, did not meet this requirement: the audio was 285.714 times the line rate.\n\nWhile existing black and white receivers could not decode a signal with a different audio carrier frequency, they could easily use the copious timing information in the video signal to decode a slightly slower line rate. Thus, the new color television standard reduced the line rate by a factor of 1.001 to 1/286 of the 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier frequency, or about 15734.2657 Hz. This reduced the frame rate to 30/1.001 ≈ 29.9700 Hz, and placed the color subcarrier at 227.5/286 = 455/572 = 35/44 of the 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier.\n\nAn NTSC or PAL television's color decoder contains a colorburst crystal oscillator.\n\nBecause so many analog color TVs were produced from the 1960s to the early 2000s, economies of scale drove down the cost of colorburst crystals, so they were often used in various other applications, such as oscillators for microprocessors or for amateur radio. (3.5795 MHz has since become a common QRP calling frequency in the 80-meter band, and its doubled frequency of 7.159 MHz is a common calling frequency in the 40-meter band).\n\n"}

Dutch dialects are remarkably diverse and are found in the Netherlands and northern Belgium.\n\nThe province of Friesland is bilingual. The West Frisian language, distinct from Dutch, is spoken here along with standard Dutch and the Stadsfries dialect. A West Frisian standard language has also been developed.\n\nIn the east, there is a Dutch Low Saxon dialect area: in Groningen (Gronings), Drenthe, Overijssel, and major parts of Gelderland, Low Saxon is spoken. The IJssel river roughly forms the linguistic watershed here. The group is not Low Franconian and is very close to neighbouring Low German.\n\nIn Holland, Hollandic is spoken, though the original forms of this dialect (which were heavily influenced by a West Frisian substratum and, from the 16th century on, by Brabantian dialects) are now relatively rare. The urban dialects of the Randstad, which are Hollandic dialects, do not diverge from standard Dutch very much, but there is a clear difference between the city dialects of Rotterdam, The Hague, Amsterdam or Utrecht. \n\nIn some rural Hollandic areas more authentic Hollandic dialects are still being used, especially north of Amsterdam.\nAnother group of dialects based on Hollandic is that spoken in the cities and larger towns of Friesland, where it partially displaced West Frisian in the 16th century and is known as Stadsfries (\"Urban Frisian\").\n\nGermanic languages which have the status of official regional or minority language and are protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in the Netherlands are Limburgish, Dutch Low Saxon and West Frisian.\n\nLimburgish receives protection by chapter 2 of the charter. In Belgium, where Limburgish is spoken as well, it does not receive such recognition or protection, because Belgium did not sign the charter. Limburgish has been influenced by the Ripuarian dialects like the Cologne dialect Kölsch, and has had a somewhat different development since the late Middle Ages.\n\nDutch Low Saxon also receives protection by chapter 2 of the charter. In some states of Germany, depending on the state, Low German receives protection by chapter 2 or 3.\n\nWest Frisian receives protection by chapter 3 of the charter. (West) Frisian evolved from the same West Germanic branch as Anglo-Saxon and Old Saxon and is less akin to Dutch.\n\nDutch dialects and regional languages are not spoken as often as they used to be. Recent research by Geert Driessen shows that the use of dialects and regional languages among both Dutch adults and youth is in heavy decline. In 1995, 27 percent of the Dutch adult population spoke a dialect or regional language on a regular basis, while in 2011 this was no more than 11 percent. In 1995, 12 percent of the primary school aged children spoke a dialect or regional language, while in 2011 this had declined to 4 percent. Of the three officially recognized regional languages Limburgish is spoken most (in 2011 among adults 54%, among children 31%) and Dutch Low Saxon least (adults 15%, children 1%); West Frisian occupies a middle position (adults 44%, children 22%). In Belgium, however, dialects are very much alive; many senior citizens there are unable to speak standard Dutch.\n\nIn Flanders, there are four main dialect groups: \nSome of these dialects, especially West and East Flemish, have incorporated some French loanwords in everyday language. An example is \"fourchette\" in various forms (originally a French word meaning fork), instead of \"vork\". Brussels is especially heavily influenced by French because roughly 85% of the inhabitants of Brussels speak French. \nThe Limburgish in Belgium is closely related to Dutch Limburgish. An oddity of West Flemings (and to a lesser extent, East Flemings) is that, when they speak AN, their pronunciation of the \"soft g\" sound (the voiced velar fricative) is almost identical to that of the \"h\" sound (the voiced glottal fricative), thus, the words \"held\" (hero) and \"geld\" (money) sound nearly the same, except that the latter word has a 'y' /j/ sound embedded into the \"soft g\". When they speak their local dialect, however, their \"g\" is almost the \"h\" of the Algemeen Nederlands, and they do not pronounce the \"h\". Some Flemish dialects are so distinct that they might be considered as separate language variants, although the strong significance of language in Belgian politics would prevent the government from classifying them as such. West Flemish in particular has sometimes been considered a distinct variety. Dialect borders of these dialects do not correspond to present political boundaries, but reflect older, medieval divisions.\nThe Brabantian dialect group, for instance, also extends to much of the south of the Netherlands, and so does Limburgish. West Flemish is also spoken in Zeelandic Flanders (part of the Dutch province of Zeeland), and by older people in French Flanders (a small area that borders Belgium).\n\n\n\n"}

The company produced dip pens, then concentrating on fountain pens until it was acquired by Venus Pencils in 1967, ceasing activities in 1971.\n\nRichard Esterbrook (1812-1895 ) was a Cornish Quaker from England who saw an opportunity in the United States to manufacture steel pens. In 1856 he traveled to the US to set up shop as \"The Steel Pen Manufacturing Company\". In 1858 he was able to establish himself as the sole pen manufacturer in the USA and he changed the company name to \"The Esterbrook Steel Pen Mfg. Co.\", with just 15 employees and settled down in Camden, New Jersey. At the time, two of the four pen companies located in the United States were situated in Camden. Besides Esterbrook, the first in the country, the C. Howard Hunt Pen Company at 7th and State streets produced pens, pencil sharpeners and allied products and employed 125 workers. At its height, the Esterbrook plant had 450 workers and produced 600,000 pens a day.\n\nThere were no men in this country learned in the pen trade and no suitable machinery, so it was necessary to design and build all machines. Only fifteen people made up the first payroll, but the growth of the company was steady. The buildings were added to from time to time and in 1912 a five-story concrete building was erected nearly doubling the size of the plant. Automatic Machines replaced hand work, and the output greatly increased.\n\nQuality was a key factor in his success. His steel pens were versatile, long lasting, and came in many different styles to fit the varied writing styles of the public. Sadly, Richard Esterbrook didn't see the \"empire\" his company was to become as he died in Atlanta on October 12, 1895. \nJust one year after his death, in 1896 the company started an Esterbrook branch in England to join the ranks of the other main pen manufactures in Birmingham. By 1920 the fountain pen was fast becoming more popular amongst people who were tired of dipping pens into ink. To meet the demand the company manufactured its first fountain pen. By 1930 the company sought less expensive means of manufacturing pens as gold and jewel tips were growing too expensive and in this same year they began selling fountain pens in England. The Esterbrook Company began using the metal Iridium which they called \"Durachrome\". To meet the fountain pen demand the company reformed as \"The Esterbrook Hazel Pens Ltd\". In 1940 war had come to strike a blow at the Esterbrook company.\n\nIn 1947 Esterbrook bought out John Mitchell (which had been established in 1822 as the World's first manufacturer to cut nibs by machine) and then acquired Hazell Pen Co. The company re-formed again as \"The Esterbrook Pen Company\". Some time after that, Esterbrook ceased production of dip pen nibs permanently.\n\nThe post war years had seen a decline particularly in the export trade to the traditional markets of the British Empire. As those countries gained independence due to American aid, they had more dollars to spend in the United States than pounds in the United Kingdom.\n\nEsterbrook continued to thrive until the beginning of 1960 when it started to see a decline in export trades with England. In 1967 the Esterbrook Empire was bought out by the Venus Pencil Company and thus the name changed to \"Venus Esterbrook\", which continued to produce replacement nibs for fountain pens. There were numerous administrative changes and moves and eventually their final base of operations was vacated in 1972, though the building still stands today.\n\nVenus Esterbrook would be finally taken over by Berol in 1971, all Esterbrook operations ceased.\n\nIn 2014, Harpen Brand Holdings, LLC announced the revival of the Esterbrook Pen brand after securing the trademark rights for the Esterbrook brand name. The brand, now named \"Esterbrook, est. 1858\", launched new versions of classic Esterbrook models, such as the \"Deluxe\" fountain pen and the \"J\" ballpoint pen, both originally released in the 1950s.\n\nEsterbrook pens were among those used by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to sign legislation. A set of 72 clear Lucite Esterbrook fountain pens were used to sign the civil rights bill into law in 1964.\n\nThe famous Disney artist Carl Barks was an enthusiastic user of Esterbrook pens. He particularly used a Nº 356 model to ink and letter his famous Donald Duck comic-book pages.\n\nPeanuts creator Charles M. Schulz used an Esterbrook 914 Radio nib for inking the comic strip. He liked the nib so much, he bought the remaining stock when Esterbrook went out of business.\n\n"}

Gang runs are generally used with sheet-fed printing presses and CMYK process color jobs, which require four separate plates that are loaded into the press. It takes up to 250 sheets for a \"make ready,\" which is the process of getting the plates inked up and the ink levels set correctly.\n\nPrinters use the term \"gang run\" or \"gang\" to describe the practice of placing many print projects on the same sheet or piggybacking a project on a vacant, unused portion of a print sheet. Sheet-fed presses are generally \"full sheet\" (28\" x 40\"), \"half sheet\" (28\" x 19\"), or \"quarter sheet\" (13\" x 19\"). In offset printing, the first sheet costs more than the next 1,000. Gang-run printing allows multiple jobs to share the setup cost. For example, a 28\" x 40\" sheet can hold 9 4\" x 6\" at 5,000 or 18 2,500 postcards (each card takes 4.25\" x 6.25\" on the sheet to accommodate full bleed. Gang-run printing has been one of the driving forces in the large drop in the price for full-color printing.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns to be aware of the potential of \"foreign\" packages, which may come from gang printing at the package supplier. Pharmaceutical labels and packaging materials are higher in cost primarily as a result of the additional costs in manufacturing due to segregation, traceability, and security requirements. You cannot \"gang run\" pharmaceutical labels that require strict line clearance between label kinds, unless the labeling from gang-printed sheets is adequately differentiated by size, shape, or color (21 CFR Part 211.122f).\n"}

A lawyer by profession, Praharaj wrote several satirical and analytical essays, in magazines such as \"Utkal Sahitya\", \"Rasachakra\", \"Nababharata\", and \"Satya Samachar\", on the social, political and cultural issues of contemporary Odisha (Odisha) during early 20th century.\n\nPraharaj was born on 9 September 1874 to an aristocratic Zamindar Brahmin family of Siddheswarpur in Cuttack district. He completed his matriculation from Ravenshaw Collegeate School and studied FA from Ravenshaw college of Cuttack. He studied law at Calcutta University and became a lawyer in 1902.\n\nHe started writing essays in the Magazine Utkal Sahitya in 1901 by the caption \"Bhagabata Tungire Sandhya\", which is the first published work by the author. It was followed by Bai Mohanty Panji and many other writings on socio-cultural and political issues. He followed the footsteps of Fakir Mohan Senapati and made a remarkable development in Odia satirical literature. Praharaj used the colloquial speech of Odisha along with Hindustani, Parsi, English, Sanskrit and folk language in his prose works. He wrote several critical essays with different pen names in many magazines up to his old age. However, he dedicated around three decades of his life to the compilation of \"Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha\".\n\nPurnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is the most comprehensive lexicon in Odia language. It presents the meaning of words in four languages—Odia, English, Hindi and Bengali, and explains the origin, development and use of the words. It consists of around 9,500 pages and 185 thousand words in 7 volumes. Praharaj not only did the work of compiling the lexicon, but also raised funds for its publication and supervised its printing and sale. Praharaj included in this lexicon not only the words which were used in literature, but also the words of common speech. The publication of the lexicon was patronised by the kings/princes of several princely states of present Orissa (Orissa). It is still recognised as the biggest dictionary in Oriya (Oriya) language, although few copies of the original printed version survive. An electronic version has been published by Srujanika.\n\nPraharaj was one of the satirists of early 20th century. His writings were published in many magazines of that period; Utkal Sahitya, Rasachakra, Nababharata, Satya Samachar and many others. Dealing with social issues, political condition of Orissa and India, and socio-cultural mentality of contemporary people these essays were written in humorous style and critical manner. Some of his essays were published in shape of books during his life. His notable works are \"Bhagabata Tungire Sandhya\", \"Bai Mohanty Panji\", \"Dunia ra Halchal\", \"Nananka Bastani\". Some of his writings are now difficult to obtain.\nPraharaj published a book Utkalara Kahani dealing with the folk stories of Odisha. Among the remarkable works of Praharaj is \"Dhaga Dhamali Rachana\" containing the idioms of Odia language. His other works include his autobiography, many poems and stories written for children, a book namely \"Bhasakosha Safar\".\n"}
{"id": "25912343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25912343", "title": "Guru Maneyo Granth", "text": "Guru Maneyo Granth\n\n\"Guru Maneyo Granth\" (English: Granth Be Thy Guru) refers to the historic statement of the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708), shortly before his demise, on affirming the sacred scripture Adi Granth as his successor, thus terminating the line of human Gurus. Installed as the Guru Granth Sahib, it is now the central holy scripture of Sikhism, and the eternal living Guru of all Sikhs. It is central to Sikh worship as it is said to imbibe the one light of the creator manifested in the Ten Sikh Gurus - one spirit in ten forms. (Bhai Gurdas) \n\nThe event in 1708 at Nanded (in present-day Maharashtra), when Guru Gobind Singh installed Adi Granth as the Guru of Sikhism, was recorded in a \"Bhatt Vahi\" (a bard's scroll) by an eyewitness, Narbud Singh, and is now celebrated as Gurgaddi (Guru Gaddi Divas), and statement is part of the central chant, \"Sabh Sikhan ko Hukam Hai, Guru Maneyo Granth\". October 2008 marked the Tercentenary year of Guruship of Guru Granth Sahib and was marked by major celebrations by Sikhs worldwide, and especially at Takht Sri Hazur Sahib, Nanded saw year-long celebrations.\n\nThe composition of the sacred Granth contains renderings of the Hymns (Bani) of seventh Gurus of the Sikh faith (in addition one sloak of Guru Gobind Singh) and some Bhagats and Saints. It was composed in this form in the year 1604 with the later addition of Guru Tegh Bahadur's Bani (sacred compositions). Its blessings are sought by the true seeker with a devout heart. The Sikh religion sincerely believes that in each of the succeeding Gurus the spirit, the light of God which manifested in Guru Nanak Dev was operating and passed onto the next Sikh Guru. Guru Ram Das says in the Siri Guru Granth Sahib: Waho Waho Satgur Nirankar Hai, Jis Ant Na Paravar - The Lord descends in this world in the form of The Satguru, but only some rare soul/devotee is able to recognise him. (SGGS, Ang 1421)\n\nThe sacred Granth is installed in all Sikh holy places of worship and treated as the presiding presence of the Guru, an embodiment of Divine Truth. The devotees of the Sangat or congregation gather in solemn assembly to pray and seek the blessings of the Supreme. This comes through in the mystical wisdom contained within the words of Gurbani and it stands for realization of the Truth. The Gurus' word, known as 'shabad' is taken as the mystic experience of the Guru.\n\nIn the words of Bhai Gurdas, a great scholar of the Guru's time, \"In the word is the Guru, and the Guru is in the word (shabad). In other words, the human body was not the Guru, but the light of the word (shabad) within the heart was their real personality.\" When the human mind dives deeper and deeper into the Guru's word, all mental impurities depart and the wisdom of the Guru permeates the human soul. Thereby the devotee attains the divine light and wisdom which leads him to contemplate and meditate on God's name (Naam). In the light of the above realities, the Sikh religion makes the holy Granth the living master of the Sikh Panth.\n\nBefore Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru left his human body, he conferred the Guruship to the [Adi Granth]. He then delivered a self-composed hymn:\n\n Jo Prabhu ko milo chahe khoj shabad mein le. Raj karega Khalsa aqi rahei na koe ,Khwar hoe sabh milange bache sharan jo hoe.\"\"\"'\n\n\n\"Under orders of the Immortal Being, the Panth was created. All Sikhs are enjoined to accept the Granth as their Guru.\n\nHe also offered his obeisance to the sacred Granth thus conveying his Light to it. This historic development took place in Oct. 1708 which ensured that the order of the Khalsa brotherhood always remained an abiding force for Sikh Panth unity.\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib begins with the \"Mul Mantar\", an iconic verse created by Nanak:\n\nHistorical events have clearly brought out that when Guru Nanak Dev appeared before the Supreme Lord, he himself presented to him a cup of God's name, known as Amrita to propagate in his subjects. Guru Nanak Dev received the Mul Mantar in his divine consciousness which defines the fundamental directive spiritual philosophy of Sikhism. It appears in the very beginning of Sri Granth Sahib, ahead of Japji.\n\nIt is composed of two elements – the figure ek (1) and logo or symbol 'onkar'. The term 'ekonkar' in full form was meant to describe transcendent formless god as creator, sustainer and dissoluter. The symbol 'onkar' gives mystical interpretation of immanent spirit of god and his becoming aspect which created the universe. It is a well-known fact that this universe was created through a primordial sound (kavao), known as first wisdom of god. It acts as an intermediary between the creator and his creation. God is spirit and pure light (Jyoti) which excites every human mind to realize the truth.\n\nIn Sikh mysticism, while meditating on Mul Mantar and its repetition believed to lead the soul to absorption in the absolute. The Mul Mantar and the Gurmantra Waheguru - the Name of god in Sikhism, repeated constantly induce a high spiritual state. The Gurmantra Waheguru - Naam unites the individual soul with the God. The Mul Mantar invokes all qualities of God. It is called the fate remover. Thus God's name is not a syllable word but a code to unfold the mystic properties of divine spirit which controls the cosmic and human being through invisible law of nature. Real name of god implies expression of his pervasive personality and concrete truth of His existence. Naam demands moulding of our personality which is meant opening of our inner self to establish personal touch with reality. Therefore, one has to be ethically strong, thoughtful and rightly meditative to attain this higher truth which is immediate and principle of man. Birth as a human being is to be taken as an opportunity to achieve liberation. It is because the achievement of emancipation is possible to man alone and that too on this earth. The history of a particular individual, the number of times he experiences rebirth depends entirely upon the quality of his will, upon the moral effort he puts forth.\n\nTo sum up, Sri Guru Granth Sahib of Sikh faith is a unique spiritual measure which gives an analytical view of the divine claws which are hidden from human gaze. Each chosen word of the text encodes the secret power of the eternity and blueprints of his working in the fleeting world of forms.\n\n"}

He dedicated 69 years of his life to Punjabi theater, in which he authored 51 books and staged numerous plays all over the world.\n\nSingh was born in 1914 at Chak # 576, near Nankana Sahib (now in Pakistan) to father, Kirpa Singh, and mother, Rakkhi. He was sent to his ancestral village, Urapar in Jalandhar District, for education. After passing class 8th from the Govt. School, Chakdanna, Singh was sent to Khalsa School, Jalandhar, for Matric (Class 10). Singh enrolled in B.A. at Khalsa College, Amritsar in 1933. Then he obtained his master's degree in Punjabi and history from FC College Lahore. Moreover, he earned his Ph.D. degree in orientalism and oriental history, with particular emphasis on classical, pre-Maurya Indo-Aryan dynasties of the Punjab and Himalayas for his thesis \"Theatre Traditions in Punjab\" from Delhi University in 1943.\n\nHe was the head of Punjabi Dept., Punjabi University, Patiala, for 10 years, from 1965 to 1975. He held the post of chairman at the Punjab Sangeet Natak Academy from 1982 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1997. He was then appointed the chairman of Punjab Arts Council, Chandigarh, from 1999 to 2002.\n\nSingh wrote his first play, \"Kamla Kumari\", in 1937, which was first staged in Amritsar on 21 January 1938. He established the Punjab Art Theatre at Lahore in 1939 and popularized theatrical activities in Punjab. He initiated a trend in Punjabi theatre with his wife Dharam Kaur, who dared to act female role in his play Anjorh, staged at YMCA Hall Lahore in 1939. This paved the way for women on Punjabi stage.\n\nSingh authored 51 books in Punjabi. He was an authority on Sikh historical plays. His well-known historical plays are \"Chamkaur Di Garhi\", \"Punian Da Chan\", \"Miti Dhundh Jag Chanan Hoa\", \"Jafarnama\", \"Sarhand Di Kandh\", \"Hind Di Chadar\", \"Rani Jindan\", \"Kama Gata Maru\" and \"Shubh Karman Te Kabh Hoon Na Taron\". The play \"Chamkaur Di Garhi\" was first staged on the occasion of the tercentenary birth celebration of Shri Guru Gobind Singh at famous Sunmukh Nanda Auditorium, Bombay, in December 1966. For the last 38 years, different theatrical groups have been staging this play in India and abroad. Six of his plays have been translated into Hindi and one into Russian.\n\nAbout a dozen of his books have won awards. He was given the prestigious Sahitya Academy Award in 1973 for his play \"Kal Aj Te Bhalak\" (Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow). He was honored by Punjab Govt. as Shromani Sahitkar in 1974. Besides these decorations he was honored by more than a dozen national and international institutions. The feature film \"Sarbansdani Guru Gobind Singh\" was based on his famous play \"Chamkaur Di Garhi\". His historical play \"Rani Jindan\" was performed by Punjabi Kala Kendra Chandigarh in 20 big cities of Canada and the US in 1981.\n\nSingh wrote the scripts of Bole So Nihal, (a world-famous multimedia Sight & Sound Panorama on 500 years of Sikh History, specially produced for the Birth of Khalsa celebrations,) Sher-e-Punjab (a multimedia Sight & Sound Panorama on 40 glorious years of Khalsa Raj) and Guru Maneo Granth, (another mega multi-media sight & sound panorama dedicated to the 400th centenary of the Prakash of Sri Guru Granth Sahib). These shows have been shown in 50 cities of Punjab and India besides in 54 major cities of the US, Canada and UK since 1999.\n"}

In recent years, Luish languages have been influenced by Burmese and Chakma Bengali.\n\nAlthough Luish languages are now widely scattered and spoken by relatively small populations, Luce (1985) suggests that the Luish languages were “once spread over the whole north of Burma, from Manipur perhaps to northern Yunnan.”\n\nMatisoff (2013) proposes the name \"Asakian\", since \"Lui\" or \"Loi\" were used by the Meithei to refer to slaves.\n\nMatisoff (2013) has demonstrated that the extinct Andro, Sengmai, and Chairel languages of Manipur are also Luish languages.\n\nAndro, Sengmai, and Chairel are extinct and known only from a glossary recorded in 1859, their speakers having switched to Meitei.

{"id": "1691675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1691675", "title": "Mizo people", "text": "Mizo people\n\nThe Mizo people (Mizo: \"Mizo hnam\") are an ethnic group native to north-eastern India, western Burma (Myanmar) and eastern Bangladesh; this term covers several ethnic peoples who speak various Kuki-Chin languages, but the languages are fairly relatable to one another. The Mizos are one of the tribal hill peoples of South Asia. All Mizo tribes and clans, in their folk legends, claim that Chhinlung/Sinlung/Khul, which means 'covered rock'or cave in the Mizo languages, was the cradle of the Mizos. Thus, it's sometimes concluded that the Mizo people lived as cave dwellers at some point.\n\nThere is no trace of human existence in Mizoram before the advent of the Mizo, largely due to the mountainous terrain and the forest coverage so thick that most sunlight could not reach the ground. Even today, the percentage of forest coverage in Mizoram is the highest in India, at 88.93% in 2015 as reported by the Forest Survey of India. Since the Lusei tribe were the first Mizo people to become known to outside groups, the larger ethnic group was initially called \"Lushai\" after them. In the earlier times, the Mizos are headhunters, taking the heads of an enemy after a battle and keeping the head as trophy. The advent of Christianity, more than a century ago had greatly transformed the people into modern society. The present Indian state of Mizoram (literally \"Mizoland\") was called the Lushai Hills or Lushai Country and was defined as an excluded area during the British Raj and a district of Assam in independent India. The people of the Lushai Hills demanded a distinct political territory when India achieved independence. Due to continued efforts by its people to gain autonomy, the national government approved Mizoram in 1972 as a Union Territory and in 1987 as a full-fledged state of the Republic of India India.\n\nAs the people organized, they chose to identify as Mizo, rather than by individual clan/tribe names such as Lushei, Ralte, Lai, Hmar, etc. Thus, there is no Mizo Tribe as such, rather an umbrella name for all the different tribes. However, unfortunately, there still are some groups who refuse to be termed Mizo and caused minor conflicts between the two. These groups are mostly from outside the State Of Mizoram, living in the neighboring territories. Of their languages, the most widely-spoken is the \"Duhlian\" dialect, which is the common language of all Mizos belong to the Tibeto-Burman language family. The state has one of the highest literacy rates in India, at more than 90%.\n\nThe term Mizo is derived from two Mizo words: \"mi\" and \"zo\". \"Mi\" in Mizo means 'person'. The term \"zo\" is disputed. According to one view, \"zo\" means 'highland' and Mizo means highlander or person living in high hills.\n\nThough the term Mizo is often used to name an overall ethnicity, it is an umbrella term to denote the various clans, such as the Hmar, Ralte, Lai, Lusei etc. A number of dialects are still spoken under the umbrella of Mizo; some of them are Mizo ṭawng (which is an official language of Mizoram), the Hmar languages, the Ralte language, the Paite languages, the Lai languages, and the Pang languages.\n\nSandwiched between Burma to the east and south and Bangladesh to the west, the Indian State of Mizoram and its surrounding areas are inhabited by the Mizo people. According to Rev Liangkhaia, the clergyman and Mizo historian, in his book \"Mizo Chanchin\" - the first ever published historical account of the Mizo - the Mizo people migrated from China in around 750 AD and stayed in western Myanmar. They then slowly began migrating towards the present day Mizoram during the fourth decade of the 16th Century. Most of the Mizos and their clans had completely migrated to their present location by the third decade of the 18th century.\n\nMizo people were influenced by British missionaries in the 19th century, as the British Raj subjugated the chieftainship under its dominance, which they later abolished by an Act called the Assam-Lushai District (Acquisition of Chief's Rights) Act in 1954. The spread of education by Christian missionaries led to a high literacy rate of 91.58% by 2011. Almost all the Mizos also adopted Christianity, and continues to be so till the present day. \n\nThe Mizos speak various Mizo languages, such as Duhlian (Lushei), Gangte and Hmar, as well as other Kuki-Chin languages such as Pawi, Ralte, Pang, Paite, and Thado.\n\nKhuma Hmar and Khara were the first to be converted into Christian among the Mizos.\nA great majority of ethnic Mizo people are Christians. The major Christian denominations are Presbyterian (majority, influenced by the affiliations of the early missionaries), Baptist, Wesleyan Methodist Church, United Pentecostal Church International, Independent Church of India, Evangelical Free Church Of India in the Northern part of Mizoram in Sinlung hills Council(northern Aizawl and northeastern Kolasib district, The Salvation Army, Lairam Jesus Christ Baptist Church, Seventh-day Adventist, Roman Catholic, Pentecostal churches and EBC(Evangelical Baptist Convention Church) in Champhai and Aizawl. \nThe Chin Baptist Church is in Champhai area in the eastern part of the state.\n\nIn the late 20th century, a rather small number of Mizo and related ethnic peoples in Manipur and Mizoram began practicing Judaism, stating that they are descendants of Manasseh, a lost tribe of Israel. They number, at most, several thousands in a population of more than 3.7 million in these states. Most Mizos do not agree with this identification. Several hundreds have already emigrated to Israel, where they undergo complete conversion to be accepted as Jews. In 2005, the Chief Rabbi of Israel ruled that they were part of a lost tribe of Israel, but anyone wishing to emigrate to Israel must first complete formal conversion to Judaism in Nepal.\n\nPre-colonialist Mizos were animists, but once the British colonized the area, the British officials converted most of the population to Christianity from their practice of Animism, ie. worshipping Nature (e.g., the Sun, the Moon, Rivers, Mountains and Spirits). As of today, more than 98% of Mizos claim themselves as Christians. Presently, there are arguably no ethnic Mizos who still practice Animism.\n\nDuring the later part of British rule, the people in Lushai Hills as well as in Manipur hills held that the British administration was trying to exert control through the chiefs of the communities. There were several rebellions against the British rule as a result, and an anti-chief movement gained ground. In 1946, the Mizo Common Peoples' Union (MCPU) was formed. In the event of India being independent, the Mizo Union, as it was soon called, demanded that Mizoram should be with Assam rather than adjoined to Burma, as the pro-chief party advocated.\n\nWith the independence of India, a secessionist group in the Union favored joining with Burma, to which they were linked historically, ethnically and linguistically, with common roots to their languages. The separation of India from Burma in the year 1937, the partition of India in 1947, and the government's administrative extension over the Indian part of the area reduced the free mobility of the inhabitants. The rules to allow free passage across the India-Burma and India-East Pakistan (now India-Bangladesh) international borders were not regularly honored. Chafing at the restrictions, many of the Mizo never accepted the new territorial boundaries; they rebelled in the March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising.\n\nThe multi-ethnic and pluralistic state of Mizoram has numerous communities, such as the Mizo (majority) {which includes the Lusei, Ralte, Hmar, Khiangte, Lai(Pawi), Khawlhring (Mivam/Faihriam), Laizo, Pang, Bawm (Sunthla and Panghawi), Tlanglau, Mara (Tlosai,Zyhno,Hawthai) etc.}, the Bru (Riang/Tuikuk), and the Chakma (Takam).\n\nMara, earlier known as Lakher, Zochhia, Shendu, Magha, is the predominant community of the southeastern district of Siaha. The demand for a separate Lakher hills district in 1945 led to the formation of an organized political party called Mara Freedom Party. Under the Sixth Schedule Amendment of Indian Constitution, they were granted an autonomous district council, Mara Autonomous District Council. \nThey have continued to struggle politically based on their strong identity. They have maintained their language through education, initially supported by the work of Christian missionaries. Due to the spread of Christianity, education also spread and molded their social life. The Mara have a high literacy rate. Their language is very much different from the other Kuki-Chin-Naga languages. They are divided mostly into Tlosai, Zyhno and Hawthai tribes in India. The Maras do not have any cave dwelling theories of their ancestors instead they told themselves of coming out of Kale-Kabaw valley.\n\nThe Paites are indigenous tribes of Mizoram under the Greater Assam state since 1750 AD. The Tribal Research Institute of Mizoram in their published book,\"Paite in Mizoram\" stated that the Paite people entered the present Mizoram along with Palian Chief of Lushai around the first half of the 18th century. The Union Government has recognised Paite as one of the tribes in Mizoram vide The Gazette of India Notice No. 10 of 2003 date 8 January 2003 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 2002.\n\nThe Paites are socially and culturally distinct from other tribes of Mizoram. Major Shakespeare, the then first Superintendent of Lushai Hills said that Paite dialect is unintelligible to Lushai. He also recorded that Paite have distinct culture and custom. They now have a separate semi-autonomous body called the Sialkal Range Development Council in the northern part of Champhai with headquarters at mimbung.\n\nIn 1953 India adopted a constitution defining itself as a Sovereign Democratic Republic. At that time the Lai people of the southern part of Mizoram, a segment of the much larger population of Lai/Chin, were granted an Autonomous District Council under the Sixth Schedule of the constitution, to support their identity. Lawngtlai was created as the Headquarters of Lai Autonomous District Council.\n\nThe people have maintained use of their language in the community and in their education. Maintenance of language as a symbol of identity has been inculcated up to Middle school standard. The Lai Autonomous District Council managed their education from Primary to Middle stage, in which the state government (Mizoram) has no control or interference. Lai people speak both Lai and Mizo languages (the latter is official in the state).\n\nThe Pang are one of the numerous tribes of Mizoram in India. They are found largely in the Chamdur valley of Bungtlang South Rural Development Block and some villages in Chawngte, Tlabung and West Phaileng Subdivisions. They have no separate regional self-government or autonomous body of their own.\n\nTogether with the Bawm and Tlanglau, they have been struggling to be recognized as a separate tribe.Most of them dwell in Chamdur Valley of India and Chittagong Hills Tracts of Bangladesh.\n\nThe Hmar are another of the numerous Mizo tribes of India, the Hmar tribe occupying a large area in the northeast of India, Pherzawl District of Manipur,Various places across Tripura and Cachar,Hailakandi,Karimganj, NC Hills District of Assam. In Mizoram the Hmar are also found in Aizawl, Kolasib, Champhai and Lunglei districts but majority of the Hmars who live in Mizoram speak the Duhlian language, and few of them who live in Sinlung Hills District Council (SHDC) still speak the Hmar(Darngawn) dialect. In Mizoram, they reside mainly in Aizawl, Kolasib, Mamit, Champhai and Lunglei. Literally, \"Hmar\" means tying of hair in a knot at the backside of the head. At some point the people of the Lusei hills were recorded as Lusei which includes many tribes like the Ralte, Lai and Hmar. Some scholars believe the name Hmar refers to a characteristic style of wearing a knot of hair on top of the head.\n\nIn July 1986, after the signing of the Mizo Accord, some Hmar leaders here formed Mizoram Hmar Association, later renamed the Hmar People's Convention (HPC). The HPC spearheaded a political movement for self-governance of the Hmar in Mizoram, demanding an Autonomous District Council (ADC) to cover the Hmar-dominated areas in the north and northwest of Mizoram. They wanted as much autonomy as had been granted to the Mara and Lai (see above).\n\nThe HPC activists formed an armed wing, the Hmar Volunteer Cell (HVC). The State Government forced them to take up arms until 1992, when representatives of the HPC and the Government of Mizoram mutually agreed to hold ministerial level talks. After multiple rounds of talks, they signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) in Aizawl on 27 July 1994. Armed cadres of the HPC surrendered along with their weapons in October 1994. The government established the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) for the Hmar. Some of the HPC leaders and cadres rejected Memorandum of Settlement, breaking away and forming the Hmar People's Convention – Democratic (HPC-D). It has continued an armed movement for autonomy in the form of Autonomous District Council within Mizoram under the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India.\nSub-tribes or clans:\n\nThe Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) have now been renamed as Sinlung Hills Council as per 2018.\n\nAfter Indian independence, the democratic change in administrative set-up of Mizoram led to an anti-chief movement. Feeling was widespread against the autocratic chiefs and for the Mizo Union. In 1955, at a meeting of representatives of various Mizo villages held in Aizawl, the demand arose for a separate hills state. The local people felt they had been ill-served by the Assam Government during the Mautam famine.\n\nWhen in 1960 the government introduced Assamese as the official language of the state, there were many protests against the Official Language Act of 1961. This was followed by the March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising, resulting in the attack of the military installations in Aizawl, Lunglei and other towns. The Mizo National Front, formerly known as Mizo National Famine Front, declared independence.\n\nThe Indian government designated Mizoram as a Union Territory on 21 January 1972. Pu Laldenga, the President of Mizo National Front, signed a Peace accord in 1986 with the Government of India, stating Mizoram was an integral part of India. Pu Laldenga came to the ministry in the Interim government which was formed in coalition with Congress in 1987. The Statehood of Mizoram was proclaimed on 20 February 1987.\n\nWith 91.58% per cent literacy, the second highest in Indian states, Mizoram is a leader in the national emphasis on education. Because of this, its people have demanded that Mizo ṭawng be recognized as an official language in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. The demand is important and expressed in various aspects of social and political life.\n\nThe English language is widely used in the state, especially in the fields of education, official matters and other formal domains, as it is in other parts of India. English had already penetrated the life and blood of the Mizo people for a long time along with the spread of education.\n\nChristian missionaries in the 19th century developed the current alphabetic system adopted for a written form of the Mizo language. Adoption of the Roman script has facilitated people's learning English as a second language. The admiration and demand for the use of English in Mizoram is no different from the same attitude in other parts of India.\n\nThe Mizo have conducted a long, drawn-out socio-political struggle for identity and recognition, and succeeded in gaining political power from the central government in New Delhi. They fear being assimilated with other communities, and continue to insist on their separate identity and use of traditional languages to help maintain that.\n\n\n"}

The reduplicated form \"moin moin\" is often heard, although some authors claim it is regarded by locals as tourists' usage.\n\nThe German comic character Werner always greets with \"Moin\".\n\nMany people think that \"moin\" derives from various regional pronunciations of \"(Guten) Morgen\" (\"good morning\"), which tend to alter, vocalise, or skip \"rg\". However, the word may actually also derive from the Dutch, Frisian, and Low German word \"mo(o)i\", meaning \"beautiful\" or \"good\". Similar forms in Low Saxon are \"mooien Dag\", \"mooien Abend\", \"mooien Mor(g)en\". Possibly, as is common in etymology, one origin is correct (either from \"Morgen\" or \"mooi\") but spread thanks to its oral assimilation with the other term.\n\nThe Luxembourgish cognate of the word is \"moien\", which can mean either \"hi\" or \"morning\" (\"gudde Moien!\" means \"good morning!\").\n\nUnlike \"Guten Morgen\", \"moin\" can be used 24 hours a day. It is semantically equivalent to the Low Saxon (Plattdüütsch) greeting \"Dagg\" and replaced it in many areas. In Southern Jutish, \"mojn\" is used for hello and good bye, but \"mojn mojn\" is solely used for good bye. The double form \"Moin Moin\" is also used as an all day greeting in for example Flensburg that belonged to Denmark until 1864 and the Swedish region of Scania, part of Denmark until 1658.\n\nIn Finland, a similar greeting \"moi\" () is used for \"hello\", \"hi\" in the Finnish language. However, \"moi moi\" is used as a good bye, similarly to \"bye bye\" in English, even with a similar intonation. Both are particularly typical of Southwestern Finnish, but through internal migration spread to the capital and with the help of TV to the rest of the language area. \"Moi\"'s use is identical to that of \"hei\": diminutive forms \"heippa\" and \"moikka\", and duplication as a good bye. Southwest Finland traded with Hanseatic cities, so it is plausible that the greeting was borrowed from their dialects.\n\n\"Moro\" is found in some parts of Finland and has also been used in the same way as \"moi\". It is theorised that it comes from Tampere due to its large number of foreign workers and like \"moi\" has been borrowed from Morrow and abbreviated.\n\n\"Moi\" is also used in Dutch Low Saxon dialects.\n\n"}

It administered Myanmar as a province of British India until 1937, and as a separate colony until 1948. During the British colonial period, English was the medium of instruction in higher education, although it did not replace Burmese as the vernacular. English was the medium of instruction in universities and two types of secondary schools: English schools and Anglo-Vernacular schools (where English was taught as a second language). Burmese English resembles Indian English to a degree because of historical ties to India during British colonization.\n\nOn 1 June 1950, a new education policy was implemented to replace Burmese as the medium of instruction at all state schools, although universities, which continued to use English as the medium of instruction, were unaffected. English became taught as a second language beginning in the Fifth Standard. Until 1965, English was the language of instruction at Burmese universities. In 1965, Burmese replaced English as the medium of instruction at the university level, with the passing of the New University Education Law the previous year. English language education was reintroduced in 1982. Currently, English is taught from Standard 0 (kindergarten), as a second language. Since 1991, in the 9th and 10th Standards, English and Burmese have both been used as the medium of instruction, particularly in science and math subjects, which use English language textbooks. Because of this, many Burmese are better able to communicate in written English than in spoken English, due to emphasis placed on writing and reading.\n\nThe preferred system of spelling is based on those of the British, although American English spellings have become increasingly popular. Because Adoniram Judson, an American, created the first Burmese-English dictionary, many American English spellings are common (e.g. \"color\", \"check\", \"encyclopedia\"). The ⟨-ize⟩ spelling is more commonly used than the ⟨-ise⟩ spelling.\n\nBurmese English is often characterised by its unaspirated consonants, similar to Indian English. It also borrows words from standard English and uses them in a slightly different context. For instance, \"pavement\" (British English) or \"sidewalk\" (US English) is commonly called \"platform\" in Burmese English. \"Stage show\" is also preferred over \"concert.\" In addition, many words retain British pronunciation, such as \"vitamin\" . Burmese English is non-rhotic.\n\nFor units of measurement Burmese English use both those of the Imperial System and those of the International System of Units interchangeably, but the values correspond to the SI system. Burmese English continues to use Indian numerical units such as lakh and crore.\n\nIn Burmese English, the k, p, and t consonants are unaspirated (pronounced ), as a general rule, as in Indian English. The following are commonly seen pronunciation differences between Standard English and Burmese English:\n\nBurmese names represented in English often include various honorifics, most commonly \"U\", \"Daw\", and \"Sayadaw\". For older Burmese who only have one or two syllables in their names these honorifics may be an integral part of the name.\n"}

{"id": "55145032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55145032", "title": "Negative evidence in language acquisition", "text": "Negative evidence in language acquisition\n\nIn language acquisition, negative evidence is evidence concerning what is not possible in a language. There is debate among linguists whether negative evidence can help child language learners determine the grammar of their language by disconfirming incorrect hypotheses about how their language works. Importantly, negative evidence does not show what \"is\" grammatical, but helps eliminate ungrammatical constructions by revealing what is \"not\" grammatical. There are two main types of negative evidence in language acquisition: \"direct\" negative evidence and \"indirect\" negative evidence.\n\nDirect negative evidence in language acquisition consists of utterances that indicate whether a construction in a language is ungrammatical. Direct negative evidence differs from indirect negative evidence because it is \"explicitly\" presented to a language learner (e.g. a child might be corrected by a parent). On the other hand, indirect negative evidence is used to determine ungrammatical constructions in a language by noticing the \"absence\" of such constructions. Direct negative evidence can be further divided into explicit and implicit forms. Explicit forms of evidence involve a parent telling their child that an utterance was incorrect and then supplying the correct version of that utterance. Implicit forms involve the repetition (or a modified repetition) of a child's ungrammatical utterance.\n\nA corpus study found that explicit negative evidence was \"very rare\", and concluded that because parents do not reliably correct their children's grammatical errors, explicit negative evidence does not facilitate language learning. Psychologist David McNeill argues that when parents correct children explicitly, the correction is unlikely to be helpful in learning grammar because it is a single correction that will most likely not be repeated, and therefore a child might not remember or even notice the correction. This is demonstrated in the following exchange between a parent and child, which McNeill recorded:\n\nImplicit direct negative evidence occurs when a parent responds to a child's ungrammatical utterance in a way that indicates that the utterance was not grammatical. This differs from explicit direct negative evidence because the parent merely implies that the child's utterance is ungrammatical, while explicit direct negative evidence involves a parent unambiguously telling a child that a sentence they produced is ungrammatical. There are several types of implicit direct negative evidence which parents utilize in responses to children's ungrammatical utterances. These forms include: repetitions, recasts, expansions, and requests for clarification. Repetitions occur when a parent repeats a child's utterance word for word, whereas recasts occur when a parent repeats a child's utterance while correcting the ungrammatical part of the sentence. Expansions are similar to recasts because they are potentially corrective utterances, but in expansions a parent also will lengthen the child's original utterance. Requests for clarification occur when a parent asks a question that can prompt a child to fix an ungrammatical sentence they previously said. Generally speaking, there is consensus that implicit direct negative evidence exists in the input, though there is debate about whether children can use implicit direct negative evidence to learn the grammar of their language. It is argued that parents frequently reformulate children's ungrammatical utterances.\n\nSome types of implicit direct negative evidence, such as reformulations, occur regularly in the input, thus making them potentially usable forms of evidence. It is the presence of the reformulations, as well as the high percentage of correct parental speech, that allows children to learn. Some studies have demonstrated that parents respond differently when children utter grammatical or ungrammatical utterances, and the researchers who conducted these studies believe that children can use this parental feedback to learn grammar because corrective and non-corrective parental feedback can be distinguished from each other. Some evidence also supports the hypothesis that children actually use implicit direct negative evidence in practice (see section below).\n\nThough there have been a number of studies that support the hypothesis that children can use implicit direct negative evidence that exists in the input, there have also been studies which stand in stark contrast to this hypothesis. Linguists who do not believe that implicit direct negative evidence is helpful for a language learner argue that studies supporting the utility of implicit direct negative evidence do not properly specify which types of utterances qualify as recasts. They criticize the fact that some types of implicit direct negative evidence are not necessarily corrective (i.e. parental responses that may qualify as implicit direct negative evidence can occur after either grammatical or ungrammatical utterances). Additionally, some of these linguists question how children would know to only pay attention to certain kinds of recasts and not others.\n\nFurthermore, Gary Marcus argues that implicit direct negative evidence in the input is insufficient for children to learn the correct grammar of their language. He criticizes negative evidence because it does not explain why sentences are ungrammatical, thus making it difficult for children to learn what their correct grammar is. He also argues that for children to be able to even use implicit direct negative evidence, they would need to repeat a sentence 85 times and receive negative feedback in order to eliminate that sentence from their vocabulary. He then shows that children typically do not repeat ungrammatical utterances in such high quantities; therefore, language learners would not be able to benefit from implicit evidence. Marcus also purports that implicit evidence is largely unavailable because the feedback differs from parent to parent, and is inconsistent in both the frequency with which it is offered and the kinds of errors it corrects. Other studies demonstrate that implicit negative evidence decreases over time, so that as children get older there is less feedback, making it less available and, consequentially, less likely to be used in or account for children's unlearning of grammatical errors.\n\nAssuming that implicit direct negative evidence is usable, there are some studies which demonstrate that children do use implicit direct negative evidence to correct their grammatical mistakes. For example, experiments show that children produce a greater number of grammatical sentences when parents provide them with any type of immediate implicit direct negative evidence, including recasts. This evidence supports claims that direct negative evidence assists a child in their language learning. Chouinard also found that children are highly attentive to parental responses and that children respond to implicit correction in predictable ways. Children tend to directly respond to these reformulations by either affirming the reformulation or disagreeing with their parent if the parent misunderstood the child's intended meaning, revealing that children can discern when parental feedback is meant to correct their grammatical errors. Additionally, children have been shown correct their initial errors when a parent recasts a child's morphological error.\n\nHowever, other researchers have conducted studies that demonstrate that children do not \"need\" negative feedback in order to learn language. This is evidenced in a case study in which a mute child was tested to see whether he could comprehend a grammar even though he had received no corrective feedback (since corrective feedback occurs as a response to ungrammatical sentences that children produce). Though the child did not produce any speech and therefore did not receive any negative feedback, researchers found that he was able to learn grammatical rules. Although this study does not answer whether negative evidence can be helpful for learning language, it does suggest that direct negative evidence is not needed to learn grammar. Another study also demonstrates that implicit negative evidence is a negative predictor of the rate at which children eliminated ungrammatical utterances from their speech.\n\nThough there is no consensus regarding whether there is sufficient and usable implicit negative evidence in the input, if children \"are\" exposed to direct negative evidence, then they could use that evidence to validate hypotheses they have made about their grammar. On the other hand, if there is not sufficient usable negative evidence in the input, then there is a \"no negative evidence\" problem, which questions of how a language learner can learn language without negative evidence. This is a problem because if a child only hears grammatical sentences which are consistent with multiple grammars, then it would be impossible to determine which grammar is correct unless there was some other factor influencing what grammar a child ultimately hypothesizes to be correct.\n\nProponents of linguistic nativism suggest that the answer to the \"no negative evidence\" problem is that language knowledge that cannot be learned is innate. They argue that the language input is not rich enough for children to develop a fully developed grammar from the input alone. This view is referred to as the poverty of the stimulus argument. The central idea of the poverty of the stimulus argument is that children could have multiple hypotheses about aspects of their grammar which are distinguishable only by negative evidence (or by hearing ungrammatical sentences and recognizing those sentences as ungrammatical). Supporters of the poverty of the stimulus argument assert that because the negative evidence that is needed to learn language by the input alone does not exist, children cannot learn certain aspects of grammar from the input alone, and therefore there must be some aspects of grammar which involve innate mechanisms.\n\nIndirect negative evidence in language acquisition is information about the grammatical structure of their own language drawn from what the language learner does not hear in speech. Indirect negative evidence serves as a means for child language learners to constrain and refine hypotheses that they previously held about the structure of their language.\n\nIndirect negative evidence can be used for more than just language learning. The calculation of probability based on observed occurrences, called Bayesian inference, serves many purposes. For example, when we see a dog bark, we are likely to think that dogs bark, not that every kind of animal barks. This is because we have never seen horses or fish or any other animal bark, so our hypothesis becomes that only dogs bark. We use this same inference to assume that the sun will rise tomorrow, having seen it rise every other day so far. No evidence received indicates that the sun may not rise once every two thousand years, or only rises on years that are not 2086, but since all evidence seen so far is consistent with the universal generalization, we infer that the sun does indeed rise every day.\n\nRegier & Gahl argue that certain Poverty of the Stimulus problems could be overcome by using indirect negative evidence. For example, syntacticians argue that children could not learn that \"one\" is anaphoric to phrasal categories given that the evidence they are exposed to is equally consistent with \"one\" being anaphoric only to individual words. This is because the meanings produced by the phrasal hypothesis are a subset of those produced by the single word hypothesis. Children could thus use the fact that all of their data is consistent with both hypotheses as evidence in favor of the more restricted hypothesis.\n\nChild and adult speakers rely on 'suspicious coincidences' when learning a new word meaning. When learning a new word meaning, children and adults use only the first few instances of hearing that word in order to decide what it means, rapidly constricting their hypothesis if only used in a narrow context. In an experiment conducted by Xu and Tenebaum, 4-year-old participants learning a novel word 'fep' readily decided that it referred only to Dalmatians if only hearing it while shown pictures of Dalmatians; although they received no information that 'fep' was unable to refer to other kinds of dogs, the suspicious coincidence that they had never heard it in other contexts caused them to restrict their meaning to just one breed.\n\nChild language learners can use this same type of probabilistic inference to decide when and how verbs can be used. A word children hear often, like 'disappear', is more likely to be used than a less common word with a similar meaning, 'vanish'. Children studied said that the ungrammatical sentence \"*We want to disappear our heads\" was ungrammatical, but when given the same sentence with vanish, they were less sure of the grammaticality. Given the frequency of 'disappear' in intransitive clauses, learners could infer that if it were possible in transitive clauses, they would have heard it in those contexts. Thus, the high frequency of the intransitive use leads to the inference that the transitive is impossible. This inference is less reliable with a less frequent verb like \"vanish\".\n\nIt has been argued that children use indirect negative evidence to make probabilistic inferences about the syntax of the language they are acquiring. A 2004 study by Regier & Gahl produced a computational model which provides support for this argument. They assert that children can use the \"absence\" of particular patterns in the input in order to conclude that such patterns are illicit. According to Regier and Gahl, young language learners form hypotheses about what is and isn't correct based on probabilistic inferences. As children are exposed to more and more examples of a certain phenomenon, their hypothesis space narrows. Notably, Regier and Gahl assert that this ability for probabilistic inference can be used in all sorts of general learning tasks, and not just linguistic ones. Regier and Gahl also present their model as evidence against an argument from the poverty of the stimulus, because their model illustrates that syntactic learning is possible from using the input alone, and does not necessarily require some innate linguistic knowledge of syntax.\n\n"}

If so, how? Will his traits be inherited by his children? Will he be a free, self-regulating personality? Will the elements of freedom incorporated into the structure of the personality make any authoritarian forms of government unnecessary?\n\nAuthor and philosopher Bernard Byhovsky, Ph.D. writes: \"The new man is endowed, first of all, with a new ethical outlook.\" \n\nThe Soviet man was to be selfless, learned, healthy, muscular, and enthusiastic in spreading the socialist Revolution. Adherence to Marxism-Leninism, and individual behavior consistent with that philosophy's prescriptions, were among the crucial traits expected of the New Soviet man, which required intellectualism and hard discipline. He was not driven by crude impulses of nature but by conscious self-mastery, a belief that required the rejection of both innate personality and the unconscious, which Soviet psychologists therefore rejected.\n\nHe treated public property with respect, as if it were his own. He also has lost any nationalist sentiments, being Soviet rather than Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any of the many other nationalities found in the USSR.\n\nHis work required exertion and austerity, to show the new man triumphing over his base instincts. Alexey Stakhanov's spurious record-breaking day in mining coal caused him to be set forth as the exemplar of the \"new man\" and the members of Stakhanovite movements tried to become Stakhanovites.\n\nThis could also be a new woman; \"Pravda\" described the Soviet woman as someone who had and could never have existed before. Female Stakhanovites were rarer than male, but a quarter of all trade-union women were designated as \"norm-breaking.\" For the Paris World Fair, Vera Mukhina depicted a momentual sculpture, \"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\", dressed in work clothing, pressing forward with his hammer and her sickle crossed.\n\nAleksandr Zinovyev put forth the satirical argument that a new kind of person was indeed created by the Soviet system, but held that this new man - which they call \"Homo Sovieticus\" - was in many ways the opposite of the ideal of the New Soviet man.\n\nAmong the major traits of a new Soviet man was selfless collectivism. The selfless new man was willing to sacrifice his life for good causes.\n\nThis trait was glorified from the first Soviet days, as exemplified by lines from the poem \"Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\" by the Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky:\n\n<poem>\nWho needs a \"1\"?\nThe voice of a \"1\"\nWho will hear it?\nA \"1\" is nonsense.\n</poem>\n\nFictional characters and presentations of contemporary celebrities embodying this model were prominent features of Soviet cultural life, especially at times when fostering the concept of the New Soviet man was given special priority by the government.\n\nPro-natalist policies encouraging women to have many children were justified by the selfishness inherent in limiting the next generation of \"new men.\"\n\nIn the 1920s and into the Stalinist era the concept of the \"New Soviet Woman\" served alongside that of the \"New Soviet Man.\" Her roles were vastly different than that of her male counterpart; she was burdened with a complex identity that changed with ideology shifts in the party doctrine toward more conservative notions of the role of the family and the mother in the Soviet system. The New Soviet Woman was a Superwoman who balanced competing responsibilities and took on the burden of multiple roles: Communist citizen, full-time worker, wife and mother.\n\nThe New Soviet Person was generally characterized as male. In Soviet propaganda centered on the New Soviet Person, it was standard for men to be depicted as the primary actors, either battling opponents of the Marxist revolution or rebuilding the world. Women, on the other hand, were often portrayed as \"backward,\" passive beneficiaries of the revolution rather than its securers. This was so not least because the proletarian movement was organized and fought by the working class, which by and large consisted of men. Thus, propaganda often equated male domination with proletariat domination. Although the party leadership claimed the sexes enjoyed equal status under the law, a significant accomplishment in itself, men remained the measure of worth.\n\nThis marginalization of women in the newly developing civil order made it difficult for women to find a place among the proletarian class for which the revolution was fought. Regulations during the New Economic Policy period on the extent to which women could work in dangerous conditions, how many hours they could work in a shift and the kinds of special care they received during maternity made many factory owners reluctant to hire women, despite the Commissariat of Labor's requirements that women to be given equal access to employment.\n\nThere were gains made in combating illiteracy and promoting education for women during the 1920s. Soviet policy encouraged working-class women to attend school and develop vocational skills. There existed opportunities for women to participate in politics, become party members and vie for elected and administrative positions. Access to the political sphere, however, was extremely limited.\n\nJoseph Stalin's policies on women were more conservative than that of his predecessor Lenin. Because he was concerned with a declining population rate, Stalin de-emphasized the Marxist feminist view of women in society, which, in his view, freed women from patriarchy and capitalism. In keeping with the party line, Stalin reasserted the importance of women in the workforce and female education, primarily literacy, although he began to emphasize the role of mother in a way that differed from more radical notions of the early 1920s.\n\nThe \"withering away\" of the family was no longer a goal of economic and political progress. The new party line was that the family, like the state, was to grow stronger with the full realization of socialism. Massive propaganda campaigns linked the joys of motherhood with the benefits of Soviet power. Soviet ideology began to argue that women's public roles were compatible with her roles as wife and mother. In fact, that the two reinforced one another and were both necessary for real womanhood.\n\nThe New Soviet Woman differed greatly from the conceptions of revolutionaries preceding the 1930s. Instead of being freed from domestic concerns, she was bound to them. Though she now filled the role of man's peer in the workplace, she was also obligated to devote herself to being his helpmate in the home. One of the primary roles of the New Soviet Woman was that of mother. This role became of great importance in the wake of population decline beginning in the 1920s. War and revolution had decimated the population. Legislation legalizing abortions and the increasing use of contraception—though still not that widespread—in the 1920s also contributed to the lower population numbers as women began to work more and give birth less.\n\nAs a means to combat that trend, propaganda placed a new emphasis on the female's role as the perpetuator of the Communist regime in their ability to produce the next class of healthy workers, a policy called pronatalism. Propaganda presented pronatalism, a means to encourage women to bear children, in different ways to urban working-class women and to rural peasant women. Propaganda designed for an urban audience linked healthy female sexuality with reproduction while medical information to peasant women positioned conception as the purpose of sexual intercourse.\n\nThe new ideal Soviet woman appealed to many Soviet women. Many had found Marxist feminism difficult to swallow and preferred their traditional female roles. Although these women drew satisfaction from their role as mothers, they appreciated the opportunity afforded them by the Communist ideology to dismantle the oppression that often went hand-in-hand with domestic life. With husbands that often beat, abused, and abandoned them and a society and government that looked down on them as intellectually and ideologically inferior prior to the Stalinist era, many women welcomed the ability to cast aside the stigma that came with their role as mother while retaining the status as an equal participant in society.\n\nDuring the 1920s and into the Stalinist era, Soviet policy forced women to curtail their professional aspirations in order to fulfill their dual role as worker and housewife. Competing requirements of family life limited female occupational mobility. Women managed the role strain experienced during the Stalinist era either by either a restriction of professional aspirations or by limiting family size. Despite pitfalls, unprecedented opportunities were available to lower-class women during this time. Women now had a voice in debates and the Zhenotdel, the women's section of the Central Committee from 1919–1930, made strides during its operation to increase political, social and economic agency of Soviet women.\n\n"}

{"id": "41440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41440", "title": "Online and offline", "text": "Online and offline\n\nIn computer technology and telecommunications, online indicates a state of connectivity, and offline indicates a disconnected state. In modern terminology this usually refers to an Internet connection, but (especially when expressed \"on line\" or \"on the line\") could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system. Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected, or that it is ready for use.\n\n\"Online\" has come to describe activities performed on and data available on the Internet, for example: \"online identity\", \"online predator\", \"online gambling\", \"online shopping\", \"online banking\", and \"online learning\". Similar meaning is also given by the prefixes \"cyber\" and \"e\", as in the words \"cyberspace\", \"cybercrime\", \"email\", and \"ecommerce\". In contrast, \"offline\" can refer to either computing activities performed while disconnected from the Internet, or alternatives to Internet activities (such as shopping in brick-and-mortar stores). The term \"offline\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the acronym \"IRL\", meaning \"in real life\".\n\nDuring the 19th century, the term \"on line\" was commonly used in both the railroad and telegraph industries. For railroads, a signal box would send messages down the line (track), via a telegraph line (cable), indicating the track's status: \"Train on line\" or \"Line clear\". Telegraph linemen would refer to sending current through a line as \"direct on line\" or \"battery on line\"; or they may refer to a problem with the circuit as being \"on line\", as opposed to the power source or end-point equipment.\n\nOne example of a common use of these concepts with email is a mail user agent (MUA) that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states. One such MUA is Microsoft Outlook. When online it will attempt to connect to mail servers (to check for new mail at regular intervals, for example), and when offline it will not attempt to make any such connection. The online or offline state of the MUA does not necessarily reflect the connection status between the computer on which it is running and the internet. That is, the computer itself may be online—connected to Internet via a cable modem or other means—while Outlook is kept offline by the user, so that it makes no attempt to send or to receive messages. Similarly, a computer may be configured to employ a dial-up connection on demand (as when an application such as Outlook attempts to make connection to a server), but the user may not wish for Outlook to trigger that call whenever it is configured to check for mail.\n\nAnother example of the use of these concepts is digital audio technology. A tape recorder, digital audio editor, or other device that is online is one whose clock is under the control of the clock of a synchronization master device. When the sync master commences playback, the online device automatically synchronizes itself to the master and commences playing from the same point in the recording. A device that is offline uses no external clock reference and relies upon its own internal clock. When a large number of devices are connected to a sync master it is often convenient, if one wants to hear just the output of one single device, to take it offline because, if the device is played back online, all synchronized devices have to locate the playback point and wait for each other device to be in synchronization. (For related discussion, see MIDI timecode, word sync, and recording system synchronization.)\n\nA third example of a common use of these concepts is a web browser that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states. The browser attempts to fetch pages from servers while only in the online state. In the offline state, users can perform offline browsing, where pages can be browsed using local copies of those pages that have previously been downloaded while in the online state. This can be useful when the computer is offline and connection to the Internet is impossible or undesirable. The pages are downloaded either implicitly into the web browser's own cache as a result of prior online browsing by the user or explicitly by a browser configured to keep local copies of certain web pages, which are updated when the browser is in the online state, either by checking that the local copies are up-to-date at regular intervals or by checking that the local copies are up-to-date whenever the browser is switched to the online state. One such web browser capable of being explicitly configured to download pages for offline browsing is Internet Explorer. When pages are added to the Favourites list, they can be marked to be \"available for offline browsing\". Internet Explorer will download to local copies both the marked page and, optionally, all of the pages that it links to. In Internet Explorer version 6, the level of direct and indirect links, the maximum amount of local disc space allowed to be consumed, and the schedule on which local copies are checked to see whether they are up-to-date, are configurable for each individual Favourites entry.\n\nFor communities that lack adequate Internet connectivity—such as developing countries, rural areas, and prisons—offline information stores such as the eGranary Digital Library (a collection of approximately thirty million educational resources from more than two thousand web sites and hundreds of CD-ROMs) provide offline access to information. Numerous organizations have developed, or are developing, flash memory chips with collections of educational materials for offline use in smartphones, tablets, and laptops.\n\nLikewise, offline storage is computer data storage that is not \"available for immediate use on demand by the system without human intervention.\" Additionally, an otherwise online system that is powered down may be considered offline.\n\nWith the growing communication tools and media, the words offline and online are used very frequently. If a person is active over a messaging tool and is able to accept the messages it is termed as online message and if the person is not available and the message is left to view when the person is back, it is termed as offline message. In the same context, the person's availability is termed as online and non-availability is termed as offline.\n\nOnline and offline distinctions have been generalised from computing and telecommunication into the field of human interpersonal relationships. The distinction between what is considered online and what is considered offline has become a subject of study in the field of sociology.\n\nThe distinction between online and offline is conventionally seen as the distinction between computer-mediated communication and face-to-face communication (e.g., face time), respectively. Online is virtuality or cyberspace, and offline is reality (i.e., real life or meatspace). Slater states that this distinction is \"obviously far too simple\". To support his argument that the distinctions in relationships are more complex than a simple dichotomy of online versus offline, he observes that some people draw no distinction between an online relationship, such as indulging in cybersex, and an offline relationship, such as being pen pals. He argues that even the telephone can be regarded as an online experience in some circumstances, and that the blurring of the distinctions between the uses of various technologies (such as PDA versus mobile phone, internet television versus internet, and telephone versus Voice over Internet Protocol) has made it \"impossible to use the term \"online\" meaningfully in the sense that was employed by the first generation of Internet research\".\n\nSlater asserts that there are legal and regulatory pressures to reduce the distinction between online and offline, with a \"general tendency to assimilate online to offline and erase the distinction,\" stressing, however, that this does not mean that online relationships are being reduced to \"pre-existing\" offline relationships. He conjectures that greater legal status may be assigned to online relationships (pointing out that contractual relationships, such as business transactions, online are already seen as just as \"real\" as their offline counterparts), although he states it to be hard to imagine courts awarding palimony to people who have had a purely online sexual relationship. He also conjectures that an online/offline distinction may be seen by people as \"rather quaint and not quite comprehensible\" within 10 years.\n\nThis distinction between \"online\" and \"offline\" is sometimes inverted, with online concepts being used to define and to explain offline activities, rather than (as per the conventions of the desktop metaphor with its desktops, trash cans, folders, and so forth) the other way around. Several cartoons appearing in \"The New Yorker\" have satirized this. One includes Saint Peter asking for a username and a password before admitting a man into Heaven. Another illustrates \"the off-line store\" where \"All items are actual size!\", shoppers may \"Take it home as soon as you pay for it!\", and \"Merchandise may be handled prior to purchase!\"\n\n"}

PGE uses these \"rules\" to convert a parsing expression grammar into Parrot bytecode. It is therefore compiling rules into a program, unlike most virtual machines and runtimes, which store regular expressions in a secondary internal format that is then interpreted at runtime by a regular expression engine. The rules format used by PGE can express any regular expression and most formal grammars, and as such it forms the first link in the compiler chain for all of Parrot's front-end languages.\n\nWhen executed, the bytecode generated by PGE will parse text as described in the input rules, generating a parse tree. The parse tree can be manipulated directly, or fed into the next stage of the Parrot compiler toolchain in order to generate an AST from which code generation can occur (if the grammar describes a programming language).\n\nOriginally named \"P6GE\" and written in C, PGE was translated to native Parrot and renamed not long after its initial release in November 2004. Its author is Patrick R. Michaud. PGE was written in order to reduce the amount of work required to implement a compiler on top of Parrot. It was also written to allow Perl 6 to easily self-host, though current Pugs development no longer uses PGE as its primary rules back-end in favor of a native engine called PCR.\n\nPGE combines three styles of parsing:\nThe primary form is Perl 6 rules, so a PGE rule might look like this for an addition-only grammar:\n\nThe operator precedence parser allows an operator table to be built and used directly in a Perl 6 rule style parser like so:\n\nThis accomplishes the same goal of defining a simple, addition-only grammar, but does so using a combination of a Perl 6 style regex/rules for codice_1 and codice_2 and a shift-reduce optable for everything else.\n\nThough PGE outputs code which will parse the grammar described by a rule, and can be used at run time to handle simple grammars and regular expressions found in code, its primary purpose is for the parsing of high level languages.\n\nThe Parrot compiler toolchain is broken into several parts, of which PGE is the first. PGE converts source code to parse trees. The Tree Grammar Engine (TGE) then converts these into Parrot Abstract Syntax Trees (PAST). A second TGE pass then converts a PAST into Parrot Opcode Syntax Trees (POST) which can be directly transformed into executable bytecode.\n\n"}
{"id": "49407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49407", "title": "Pliny the Younger", "text": "Pliny the Younger\n\nGaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus, born Gaius Caecilius or Gaius Caecilius Cilo (61 – c. 113), better known as Pliny the Younger (), was a lawyer, author, and magistrate of Ancient Rome. Pliny's uncle, Pliny the Elder, helped raise and educate him.\n\nPliny the Younger wrote hundreds of letters, of which 247 survive and are of great historical value. Some are addressed to reigning emperors or to notables such as the historian Tacitus. Pliny served as an imperial magistrate under Trajan (reigned 98–117), and his letters to Trajan provide one of the few surviving records of the relationship between the imperial office and provincial governors.\n\nPliny rose through a series of civil and military offices, the \"cursus honorum\". He was a friend of the historian Tacitus and might have employed the biographer Suetonius on his staff. Pliny also came into contact with other well-known men of the period, including the philosophers Artemidorus and Euphrates the Stoic, during his time in Syria.\n\nPliny the Younger was born in \"Novum Comum\" (Como, Northern Italy) around 61 AD, the son of Lucius Caecilius Cilo, born there, and his wife Plinia Marcella, a sister of Pliny the Elder. He was the grandson of Senator and landowner Gaius Caecilius, revered his uncle, Pliny the Elder (who at this time was extremely famous around the Roman Empire), and provided sketches of how his uncle worked on the \"Naturalis Historia\".\n\nCilo died at an early age, when Pliny was still young. As a result, the boy probably lived with his mother. His guardian and preceptor in charge of his education was Lucius Verginius Rufus, famed for quelling a revolt against Nero in 68 AD.\n\nAfter being first tutored at home, Pliny went to Rome for further education. There he was taught rhetoric by Quintilian, a great teacher and author, and Nicetes Sacerdos of Smyrna. It was at this time that Pliny became closer to his uncle Pliny the Elder. When Pliny the Younger was 17 or 18, his uncle Pliny the Elder died attempting to rescue victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and the terms of the Elder Pliny's will passed his estate to his nephew. In the same document the younger Pliny was adopted by his uncle. As a result, Pliny the Younger changed his name from \"Gaius Caecilius Cilo\" to \"Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus\" (his official title was \"Gaius Plinius Luci filius Caecilius Secundus\").\n\nThere is some evidence that Pliny had a sibling. A memorial erected in Como (now ) repeats the terms of a will by which the \"aedile\" Lucius Caecilius Cilo, son of Lucius, established a fund, the interest of which was to buy oil (used for soap) for the baths of the people of Como. The trustees are apparently named in the inscription: \"L. Caecilius Valens and P. Caecilius Secundus, sons of Lucius, and the \"contubernalis\" Lutulla.\" The word \"contubernalis\" describing Lutulla is the military term meaning \"tent-mate\", which can only mean that she was living with Lucius, not as his wife. The first man mentioned, L. Caecilius Valens, is probably the older son. Pliny the Younger confirms that he was a trustee for the largess \"of my ancestors\". It seems unknown to Pliny the Elder, so Valens' mother was probably not his sister Plinia; perhaps Valens was Lutulla's son from an earlier relationship.\n\nPliny the Younger married three times, firstly, when he was very young (about 18), to a stepdaughter of Veccius Proculus', who died at age 37; secondly, at an unknown date, to the daughter of Pompeia Celerina; and thirdly to Calpurnia, daughter of Calpurnius and granddaughter of Calpurnius Fabatus of Comum. Letters survive in which Pliny recorded this last marriage taking place, his attachment to Calpurnia, and his sadness when she miscarried their child.\n\nPliny is thought to have died suddenly during his convention in Bithynia-Pontus, around 113 AD, since no events referred to in his letters date later than that.\n\nPliny was by birth of equestrian rank, that is, a member of the aristocratic order of \"equites\" (knights), the lower (beneath the senatorial order) of the two Roman aristocratic orders that monopolised senior civil and military offices during the early Empire. His career began at the age of 18 and initially followed a normal equestrian route. But, unlike most equestrians, he achieved entry into the upper order by being elected Quaestor in his late twenties. (See Career summary below.)\n\nPliny was active in the Roman legal system, especially in the sphere of the Roman centumviral court, which dealt with inheritance cases. Later, he was a well-known prosecutor and defender at the trials of a series of provincial governors, including Baebius Massa, governor of Baetica; Marius Priscus, governor of Africa; Gaius Caecilius Classicus, governor of Baetica; and most ironically in light of his later appointment to this province, Gaius Julius Bassus and Varenus Rufus, both governors of Bithynia and Pontus.\n\nPliny's career is commonly considered as a summary of the main Roman public charges and is the best-documented example from this period, offering proof for many aspects of imperial culture. Effectively, Pliny crossed all the principal fields of the organization of the early Roman Empire. It is an achievement for a man to have not only survived the reigns of several disparate emperors, especially the much-detested Domitian, but also to have risen in rank throughout.\n\nPliny penned his first work at age 14: a tragedy in Greek. Additionally, in the course of his life, he wrote numerous poems, most of which are lost. He was also known as a notable \"orator\"; though he professed himself a follower of Cicero's, Pliny's prose was more magniloquent and less direct than Cicero's.\n\nPliny's only oration that now survives is the \"Panegyricus Traiani\". This was delivered in the Senate in 100 and is a description of Trajan's figure and actions in an adulatory and emphatic form, especially contrasting him with the Emperor Domitian. It is, however, a relevant document that reveals many details about the Emperor's actions in several fields of his administrative power such as taxes, justice, military discipline, and commerce. Recalling the speech in one of his letters, Pliny shrewdly defines his own motives thus:\nThe largest surviving body of Pliny's work is his \"Epistulae\" (\"Letters\"), a series of personal missives directed to his friends and associates. These letters are a unique testimony of Roman administrative history and everyday life in the 1st century AD. Especially noteworthy among the letters are two in which he describes the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in August 79, during which his uncle Pliny the Elder died (\"Epistulae\" VI.16, VI.20), and one in which he asks the Emperor for instructions regarding official policy concerning Christians (\"Epistulae\" X.96).\n\nPliny wrote the two letters describing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius approximately 25 years after the event, and both were sent in response to the request of his friend, the historian Tacitus, who wanted to know more about Pliny the Elder's death. The two letters have great historical value due to their accurate description of Vesuvius' eruption; Pliny's attention to detail in the letters about Vesuvius is so keen that modern volcanologists describe those types of eruptions as \"Plinian eruptions\".\n\nAs the Roman governor of Bithynia-Pontus (now in modern Turkey) Pliny wrote a letter to Emperor Trajan around 112 AD and asked for counsel on dealing with Christians. In the letter (\"Epistulae\" X.96) Pliny detailed an account of how he conducted trials of suspected Christians who appeared before him as a result of anonymous accusations and asked for the Emperor's guidance on how they should be treated. Pliny had never performed a legal investigation of Christians and thus consulted Trajan in order to be on solid ground regarding his actions. Pliny saved his letters and Trajan's replies and these are the earliest surviving Roman documents to refer to early Christians. Trajan's response to Pliny makes it clear that being a Christian was sufficient for punishment, but Christians were not to be tracked down and anonymous denunciations were to be ignored. The correspondence between Pliny and Emperor Trajan shows that the Roman Empire, as a government entity, did not at this time “seek out” Christians for prosecution or persecution.\n\nIn France Giovanni Giocondo discovered a manuscript of Pliny the Younger's letters containing his correspondence with Trajan. He published it in Paris dedicating the work to Louis XII. Two Italian editions of Pliny's Epistles were published by Giocondo, one printed in Bologna in 1498 and one from the press of Aldus Manutius in 1508.\n\nPliny loved villas. Being wealthy, he owned many, such as the one in Lake Como named \"Tragedy\" because of its location high on a hill. Another, on the shore of the lake, was named \"Comedy\" because it was sited low down. Pliny's main estate in Italy was in the north of Umbria, under the passes of Bocca Trabaria and Bocca Serriola, where wood was harvested for Roman ships and sent to Rome via the Tiber.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23915", "title": "Portuguese language", "text": "Portuguese language\n\nPortuguese ( or, in full, ) is a Western Romance language originating in the Iberian Peninsula. It is the sole official language of Portugal, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola, and São Tomé and Príncipe. It also has co-official language status in East Timor, Equatorial Guinea and Macau in China. As the result of expansion during colonial times, a cultural presence of Portuguese and Portuguese creole speakers are also found in Goa, Daman and Diu in India; in Batticaloa on the east coast of Sri Lanka; in the Indonesian island of Flores; in the Malacca state of Malaysia; and the ABC islands in the Caribbean where Papiamento is spoken, while Cape Verdean Creole is the most widely spoken Portuguese-based Creole. A Portuguese-speaking person or nation may be referred to as \"Lusophone\" in both English and Portuguese.\n\nPortuguese is part of the Ibero-Romance group that evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in the medieval Kingdom of Galicia and the County of Portugal, and has kept some Celtic phonology and lexicon. With approximately 215 to 220 million native speakers and 250 million total speakers, Portuguese is usually listed as the sixth most natively spoken language in the world, the third-most spoken European language in the world in terms of native speakers, and the most spoken language in the Southern Hemisphere. It is also the most spoken language in South America and the second-most spoken in Latin America after Spanish, one of the 10 most spoken languages in Africa and is an official language of the European Union, Mercosur, OAS, ECOWAS and the African Union.\n\nWhen the Romans arrived at the Iberian Peninsula in 216 B.C., they brought the Latin language with them, from which all Romance languages descend. The language was spread by Roman soldiers, settlers, and merchants, who built Roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous Celtic or Celtiberian civilizations established long before the Roman arrivals. For that reason, the language has kept a relevant substratum of much older, Atlantic European Megalithic Culture and Celtic culture. \n\nBetween 409 A.D. and 711 A.D., as the Roman Empire collapsed in Western Europe, the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Germanic peoples of the Migration Period. The occupiers, mainly Suebi, Visigoths and Buri who originally spoke Germanic languages, quickly adopted late Roman culture and the Vulgar Latin dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300 years totally integrated into the local populations. After the Moorish invasion beginning in 711, Arabic became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions, but most of the remaining Christian population continued to speak a form of Romance commonly known as Mozarabic, which lasted three centuries longer in Spain.\n\nPortuguese evolved from the medieval language, known today by linguists as Galician-Portuguese, Old Portuguese or Old Galician, of the northwestern medieval Kingdom of Galicia and County of Portugal. It is in Latin administrative documents of the 9th century that written Galician-Portuguese words and phrases are first recorded. This phase is known as Proto-Portuguese, which lasted from the 9th century until the 12th-century independence of the County of Portugal from the Kingdom of León, which had by then assumed reign over Galicia.\n\nIn the first part of the Galician-Portuguese period (from the 12th to the 14th century), the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms. For some time, it was the language of preference for lyric poetry in Christian Hispania, much as Occitan was the language of the poetry of the troubadours in France. The Occitan digraphs \"lh\" and \"nh\", used in its classical orthography, were adopted by the orthography of Portuguese, presumably by Gerald of Braga, a monk from Moissac, who became bishop of Braga in Portugal in 1047, playing a major role in modernizing written Portuguese using classical Occitan norms.. Portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139, under King Afonso I of Portugal. In 1290, King Denis of Portugal created the first Portuguese university in Lisbon (the \"Estudos Gerais\", which later moved to Coimbra) and decreed for Portuguese, then simply called the \"common language\", to be known as the Portuguese language and used officially.\n\nIn the second period of Old Portuguese, in the 15th and 16th centuries, with the Portuguese discoveries, the language was taken to many regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. By the mid-16th century, Portuguese had become a \"lingua franca\" in Asia and Africa, used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities.\n\nIts spread was helped by mixed marriages between Portuguese and local people and by its association with Roman Catholic missionary efforts, which led to the formation of creole languages such as that called Kristang in many parts of Asia (from the word \"cristão\", \"Christian\"). The language continued to be popular in parts of Asia until the 19th century. Some Portuguese-speaking Christian communities in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Indonesia preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal.\n\nThe end of the Old Portuguese period was marked by the publication of the \"Cancioneiro Geral\" by Garcia de Resende, in 1516. The early times of Modern Portuguese, which spans the period from the 16th century to the present day, were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from Classical Latin and Classical Greek because of the Renaissance (learned words borrowed from Latin also came from Renaissance Latin, the form of Latin during that time), which greatly enriched the lexicon. Most literate Portuguese speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Portuguese.\n\nSpanish author Miguel de Cervantes once called Portuguese \"the sweet and gracious language\", while the Brazilian poet Olavo Bilac described it as (\"the last flower of Latium, rustic and beautiful\"). Portuguese is also termed \"the language of Camões\", after Luís Vaz de Camões, one of the greatest literary figures in the Portuguese language and author of the Portuguese epic poem \"Os Lusíadas\".\n\nIn March 2006, the Museum of the Portuguese Language, an interactive museum about the Portuguese language, was founded in São Paulo, Brazil, the city with the greatest number of Portuguese language speakers in the world. The museum is the first of its kind in the world. In 2015 the museum was destroyed in a fire, but there are plans to reconstruct it.\n\nPortuguese is the native language of the vast majority of people in Brazil and Portugal, and 99.8% of the population of São Tomé and Príncipe declared speaking Portuguese in the 1991 census. Perhaps 75% of the population of Angola speaks Portuguese natively, and 85% are more or less fluent. Just over 40% (and rapidly increasing) of the population of Mozambique are native speakers of Portuguese, and 60% are fluent, according to the 2007 census. Portuguese is also spoken natively by 30% of the population in Guinea-Bissau, and a Portuguese-based creole is understood by all. No data is available for Cape Verde, but almost all the population is bilingual, and the monolingual population speaks Cape Verdean Creole.\n\nThere are also significant Portuguese-speaking immigrant communities in many countries including Andorra (15.4%), Bermuda, Canada (400,275 people in the 2006 census), France (900,000 people), Japan (400,000 people), Jersey, Namibia (about 4–5% of the population, mainly refugees from Angola in the north of the country), Paraguay (10.7% or 636,000 people), Macau (0.6% or 12,000 people), Switzerland (196,000 nationals in 2008), Venezuela (554,000). and the United States (0.35% of the population or 1,228,126 speakers according to the 2007 American Community Survey).\n\nIn some parts of former Portuguese India, namely Goa and Daman and Diu, the language is still spoken by about 10,000 people. In 2014, an estimated 1,500 students were learning Portuguese in Goa.\n\nThe Community of Portuguese Language Countries\n(in Portuguese \"Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa\", with the Portuguese acronym CPLP) consists of the eight independent countries that have Portuguese as an official language: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and São Tomé and Príncipe.\n\nEquatorial Guinea made a formal application for full membership to the CPLP in June 2010, a status given only to states with Portuguese as an official language. In 2011, Portuguese became its third official language (besides Spanish and French) and, in July 2014, the country was accepted as a member of the CPLP.\n\nPortuguese is also one of the official languages of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China of Macau (alongside Chinese) and of several international organizations, including the Mercosur, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Union of South American Nations, the Organization of American States, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the Southern African Development Community and the European Union.\n\nAccording to The World Factbook country population estimates for 2017, the population of each of the ten jurisdictions is as follows (by descending order):\n\nThe combined population of the entire Lusophone area was estimated at 279 million in July 2017. This number does not include the Lusophone diaspora, estimated at approximately 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians, and half a million Cape Verdeans, among others), although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language. Additionally, a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and PALOP emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.\n\nThe Portuguese language therefore serves more than 250 million people daily, who have direct or indirect legal, juridical and social contact with it, varying from the only language used in any contact, to only education, contact with local or international administration, commerce and services or the simple sight of road signs, public information and advertising in Portuguese.\n\nPortuguese is a mandatory subject in the school curriculum in Uruguay. Other countries where Portuguese is commonly taught in schools or where it is being introduced as an option now include Venezuela, Zambia, the Republic of the Congo, Senegal, Namibia, Swaziland, and South Africa. In all of the listed countries Portuguese is spoken either as native language by minorities due to the Portuguese colonial past or as a \"lingua franca\" in bordering and multilingual regions, such as on the border between Brazil and Uruguay and Angola and Namibia.\n\nAccording to estimates by UNESCO, Portuguese is the fastest-growing European language after English and the language has, according to the newspaper \"The Portugal News\" publishing data given from UNESCO, the highest potential for growth as an international language in southern Africa and South America. Portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents, and as a second language by millions worldwide.\n\nSince 1991, when Brazil signed into the economic community of Mercosul with other South American nations, namely Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Portuguese is either mandatory, or taught, in the schools of those South American countries.\n\nAlthough early in the 21st century, after Macau was ceded to China and Brazilian immigration to Japan slowed down, the use of Portuguese was in decline in Asia, it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there, mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful Portuguese-speaking countries (Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, etc.) in the world.\n\n, a pronoun meaning \"you\", is used for educated, formal, and colloquial respectful speech in most Portuguese-speaking regions. In the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, is virtually absent from the spoken language. In Portugal, it may be considered disrespectful to treat a stranger as , so the pronoun is either replaced by the name of the person (or a title) or it is omitted, since the verbal conjugation allows the distinction between formal and informal treatment. Riograndense (or Gaúcho) Portuguese normally distinguishes formal from informal speech by verbal conjugation. Informal speech employs \"tu\" followed by third person verbs, formal language retains the traditional second person.\n\nConjugation of has three different forms in Brazil (verb \"to see\": , in the traditional second person, , in the third person, and , in the innovative second person), the conjugation used in the Brazilian states of Pará, Santa Catarina and Maranhão being generally traditional second person, the kind that is used in other Portuguese-speaking countries and learned in Brazilian schools.\n\nThe predominance of Southeastern-based media products has established \"você\" as the pronoun of choice for the second person singular in both writing and multimedia communications. However, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the country's main cultural centre, the usage of \"tu\" has been expanding ever since the end of the 20th century (see, a linguistic research on the topic in Portuguese), being most frequent among youngsters and a number of studies have also shown an increase in its use in a number of other Brazilian dialects.\n\nModern Standard European Portuguese (' or ') is based on the Portuguese spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of Coimbra and Lisbon, in central Portugal. Standard European Portuguese is also the preferred standard by the Portuguese-speaking African countries. As such, and despite the fact that its speakers are dispersed around the world, Portuguese has only two dialects used for learning: the European and the Brazilian. Some aspects and sounds found in many dialects of Brazil are exclusive to South America, and cannot be found in Europe. However, the Santomean Portuguese in Africa may be confused with a Brazilian dialect by its phonology and prosody.\n\nAudio samples of some dialects and accents of Portuguese are available below. There are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible. IPA transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation.\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between dialects are mostly of accent and vocabulary, but between the Brazilian dialects and other dialects, especially in their most colloquial forms, there can also be some grammatical differences. The Portuguese-based creoles spoken in various parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas are independent languages.\n\nPortuguese, like Catalan, preserved the stressed vowels of Vulgar Latin, which became diphthongs in most other Romance languages; cf. Port., Cat., Sard. \"pedra\" ; Fr. ', Sp. ', It. ', Ro. ', from Lat. ' (\"stone\"); or Port. ', Cat. ', Sard. '; Sp. ', It. ', Fr. ', Ro. ', from Lat. ' (\"fire\"). Another characteristic of early Portuguese was the loss of intervocalic \"l\" and \"n\", sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels, or by the insertion of an epenthetic vowel between them: cf. Lat. ' (\"to jump\"), ' (\"to hold\"), ' (\"chain\"), Sp. ', ', ', Port. ', ', '. \n\nWhen the elided consonant was \"n\", it often nasalized the preceding vowel: cf. Lat. ' (\"hand\"), ' (\"frog\"), ' (\"good\"), Port. ', ', ' (now ', ', '). This process was the source of most of the language's distinctive nasal diphthongs. In particular, the Latin endings ', ' and ' became ' in most cases, cf. Lat. ' (\"dog\"), ' (\"brother\"), ' (\"reason\") with Modern Port. ', ', \"\", and their plurals \"-anes\", \"-anos\", \"-ones\" normally became \"-ães\", \"-ãos\", \"-ões\", cf. \"cães\", \"irmãos\", \"razões\". \n\nThe Portuguese language is the only Romance language that has preserved the clitic case mesoclisis: cf. ' (I'll give thee), ' (I'll love you), ' (I'll contact them). Like Galician, it also retains the Latin synthetic pluperfect tense: ' (I had been), ' (I had lived), ' (you had lived). Romanian also has this tense, but uses the -s- form.\n\nMost of the lexicon of Portuguese is derived, directly or through other Romance languages, from Latin. Nevertheless, because of its original Lusitanian and Celtic Gallaecian heritage, and the later participation of Portugal in the Age of Discovery, it has some words from pre-Latin Paleohispanic languages and adopted loanwords from other languages around the world.\n\nA number of Portuguese words can still be traced to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal, which included the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici and Cynetes. Most of these words derived from the Hispano-Celtic Gallaecian language of northwestern Iberia, and are very often shared with Galician since both languages share a common origin in the medieval language of Galician-Portuguese. A few of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from other Celtic sources, often Gaulish. Altogether these are over 1,000 words, some verbs and toponymic names of towns, rivers, utensils and plants.\n\nIn the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania) was conquered by the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed with some 500 Germanic words to the lexicon. Many of these words are related to warfare—such as \"espora\" \"spur\", \"estaca\" \"stake\", and \"guerra\" \"war\", from Gothic \"*spaúra\", \"*stakka\", and \"*wirro\", respectively. The Germanic languages influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such has Ermesinde, Esposende and Resende where \"sinde\" and \"sende\" are derived from the Germanic \"sinths\" (military expedition) and in the case of Resende, the prefix \"re\" comes from Germanic \"reths\" (council). Other examples of Portuguese names, surnames and town names of Germanic toponymic origin include Henrique, Henriques, Vermoim, Mandim, Calquim, Baguim, Gemunde, Guetim, Sermonde and many more, are quite common mainly in the old Suebi and later Visigothic dominated regions, covering today's Northern half of Portugal and Galicia.\n\nBetween the 9th and early 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired some 400 to 600 words from Arabic by influence of Moorish Iberia. They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article \"a(l)-\", and include common words such as \"aldeia\" \"village\" from الضيعة \"alḍai`a\" (or from Edictum Rothari: \"aldii\", \"aldias\"), \"alface\" \"lettuce\" from الخس \"alkhass\", \"armazém\" \"warehouse\" from المخزن \"almakhzan\", and \"azeite\" \"olive oil\" from الزيت \"azzait\".\n\nStarting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, \"catana\" \"cutlass\" from Japanese \"katana\", \"chá\" \"tea\" from Chinese \"\"chá\"\", and \"canja\" \"chicken-soup, piece of cake\" from Malay.\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, because of the role of Portugal as intermediary in the Atlantic slave trade, and the establishment of large Portuguese colonies in Angola, Mozambique, and Brazil, Portuguese acquired several words of African and Amerind origin, especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories. While those terms are mostly used in the former colonies, many became current in European Portuguese as well. From Kimbundu, for example, came \"kifumate\" > \"cafuné\" \"head caress\" (Brazil), \"kusula\" > \"caçula\" \"youngest child\" (Brazil), \"marimbondo\" \"tropical wasp\" (Brazil), and \"kubungula\" > \"bungular\" \"to dance like a wizard\" (Angola). From South America came \"batata\" \"potato\", from Taino; \"ananás\" and \"abacaxi\", from Tupi–Guarani \"naná\" and Tupi \"ibá cati\", respectively (two species of pineapple), and \"pipoca\" \"popcorn\" from Tupi and \"tucano\" \"toucan\" from Guarani \"tucan\".\n\nFinally, it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other European languages, especially French and English. These are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords. There are many examples such as: \"colchete\"/\"crochê\" \"bracket\"/\"crochet\", \"paletó\" \"jacket\", \"batom\" \"lipstick\", and \"filé\"/\"filete\" \"steak\"/\"slice\", \"rua\" \"street\" respectively, from French \"crochet\", \"paletot\", \"bâton\", \"filet\", \"rue\"; and \"bife\" \"steak\", \"futebol\", \"revólver\", \"stock\"/\"estoque\", \"folclore\", from English \"beef\", \"football\", \"revolver\", \"stock\", \"folklore\".\n\nExamples from other European languages: \"macarrão\" \"pasta\", \"piloto\" \"pilot\", \"carroça\" \"carriage\", and \"barraca\" \"barrack\", from Italian \"maccherone\", \"pilota\", \"carrozza\", and \"baracca\"; \"melena\" \"hair lock\", \"fiambre\" \"wet-cured ham\" (in Portugal, in contrast with \"presunto\" \"dry-cured ham\" from Latin \"prae-exsuctus\" \"dehydrated\") or \"canned ham\" (in Brazil, in contrast with non-canned, wet-cured \"presunto cozido\" and dry-cured \"presunto cru\"), and \"castelhano\" \"Castilian\", from Spanish \"melena\" \"mane\", \"fiambre\" and \"castellano\".\n\nBefore the last four decades, Brazilians adopted a greater number of loanwords from Japanese and other European languages (due to the historical immigration affecting their demographics), and they were and are also more willing to adopt foreign terms that come from globalization than the Portuguese, while the degree of African, Tupian and other Amerindian lexicon in Brazilian Portuguese is shown to be surprisingly lesser than that commonly expected of the said variant by the local Africanist and Indianist academia (that also has to some degree influenced the common sense of what gives a different cultural identity of Brazilians in relation to the Portuguese), so that its lexicon is almost identical (about 99%) to that of European Portuguese.\n\nMany Portuguese settlers to Colonial Brazil were from northern and insular Portugal, apart from some historically important illegal immigrants from elsewhere in Europe, such as Galicia, France and the Netherlands. Brazil received more European immigrants in its colonial history than the United States. Between 1500 and 1760, 700,000 Europeans (overwhelmingly Portuguese) settled in Brazil, while 530,000 Europeans settled in the United States for the same given time.\n\nPortuguese belongs to the West Iberian branch of the Romance languages, and it has special ties with the following members of this group:\n\nPortuguese and other Romance languages (namely French and Italian) are moderately mutually intelligible, and share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar. Portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study before attaining strong comprehension in those Romance languages, and vice versa. However, Portuguese and Galician are mutually intelligible, and Spanish is highly asymmetrically comprehensible to Portuguese speakers. Given that Portuguese has a larger phonemic inventory than Spanish, Portuguese is still considerably intelligible (if spoken slowly and without jargon) to most Spanish speakers, owing to their genealogical proximity and shared genealogical history as West Iberian (Ibero-Romance languages), historical contact between speakers and mutual influence, shared areal features as well as modern lexical, structural, and grammatical similarity (89%) between them.\n\n\"Portunhol\", a form of code-switching, has a more lively use and is more readily mentioned in popular culture in South America. Said code-switching is not to be confused with the \"portunhol\" spoken on the borders of Brazil with Uruguay () and Paraguay (), and of Portugal with Spain (), that are Portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people, which have been heavily influenced by Spanish.\n\nPortuguese and Spanish are the only Ibero-Romance languages, and perhaps the only Romance languages with such thriving inter-language forms, in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code-switching have formed, in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language (known as 'Portunhol') without a learned acquisition process, but nevertheless facilitates communication. There is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena (including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their usage).\n\nThe closest relative of Portuguese is Galician, which is spoken in the autonomous community (region) and historical nationality of Galicia (northwestern Spain). The two were at one time a single language, known today as Galician-Portuguese, but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of Portugal from Galicia. There is, however, still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of Galician referred to as \"galego-português baixo-limiao\", which is spoken in several Galician villages between the municipalities of Entrimo and Lobios and the transborder region of the natural park of Peneda-Gerês/Xurês. It is \"considered a rarity, a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from Cantabria to Mondego [...]\".\nAs reported by UNESCO, due to the pressure of the Spanish language on the standard official version of the Galician language, the Galician language was on the verge of disappearing. According to the Unesco philologist Tapani Salminen, the proximity to Portuguese protects Galician.\nNevertheless, the core vocabulary and grammar of Galician are still noticeably closer to Portuguese than to those of Spanish. In particular, like Portuguese, it uses the future subjunctive, the personal infinitive, and the synthetic pluperfect. Mutual intelligibility (estimated at 90% by R. A. Hall, Jr., 1989) is excellent between Galicians and northern Portuguese. Many linguists consider Galician to be a co-dialect of the Portuguese language.\n\nAnother member of the Galician-Portuguese group, most commonly thought of as a Galician dialect, is spoken in the Eonavian region in a western strip in Asturias and the westernmost parts of the provinces of León and Zamora, along the frontier with Galicia, between the Eo and Navia rivers (or more exactly Eo and Frexulfe rivers). It is called \"eonaviego\" or \"gallego-asturiano\" by its speakers.\n\nThe Fala language, known by its speakers as \"xalimés\", \"mañegu\", \"a fala de Xálima\" and \"chapurráu\" and in Portuguese as \"a fala de Xálima\", \"a fala da Estremadura\", \"o galego da Estremadura\", \"valego\" ou \"galaico-estremenho\", is another descendant of Galician-Portuguese, spoken by a small number of people in the Spanish towns of Valverde del Fresno (\"Valverdi du Fresnu\"), Eljas (\"As Ellas\") and San Martín de Trevejo (\"Sa Martín de Trevellu\") in the autonomous community of Extremadura, near the border with Portugal.\n\nThere are a number of other places in Spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the Galician-Portuguese group, such as La Alamedilla, Cedillo (\"Cedilho\"), Herrera de Alcántara (\"Ferreira d'Alcântara\") and Olivenza (\"Olivença\"), but in these municipalities, what is spoken is actually Portuguese, not disputed as such in the mainstream.\n\nIt should be noticed that the diversity of dialects of the Portuguese language is known since the time of medieval Portuguese-Galician language when it coexisted with the Lusitanian-Mozarabic dialect, spoken in the south of Portugal. The dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of Fernão d'Oliveira, in the Grammatica da Lingoagem Portuguesa, (1536), where he remarks that the people of Portuguese regions of Beira, Alentejo, Estremadura, and Entre Douro e Minho, all speak differently from each other. Also Contador d'Argote (1725) distinguishes three main varieties of dialects: the local dialects, the dialects of time, and of profession (work jargon). Of local dialects he highlights five main dialects: the dialect of Estremadura, of Entre-Douro e Minho, of Beira, of Algarve and of Trás-os-Montes. He also makes reference to the overseas dialects, the rustic dialects, the poetic dialect and that of prose.\n\nIn the kingdom of Portugal, \"Ladinho\" (or \"Lingoagem Ladinha\") was the name given to the pure Portuguese language romance, without any mixture of Aravia or Gerigonça Judenga. While the term \"língua vulgar\" was used to name the language before D. Dinis decided to call it \"Portuguese language\", the erudite version used and known as Galician-Portuguese (the language of the Portuguese court) and all other Portuguese dialects were spoken at the same time. In a historical perspective the Portuguese language was never just one dialect. Just like today there is a standard Portuguese (actually two) among the several dialects of Portuguese, in the past there was Galician-Portuguese as the \"standard\", coexisting with other dialects.\n\nPortuguese has provided loanwords to many languages, such as Indonesian, Manado Malay, Malayalam, Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhalese, Malay, Bengali, English, Hindi, Swahili, Afrikaans, Konkani, Marathi, Tetum, Xitsonga, Japanese, Lanc-Patuá (spoken in northern Brazil), Esan and Sranan Tongo (spoken in Suriname). It left a strong influence on the \"língua brasílica\", a Tupi–Guarani language, which was the most widely spoken in Brazil until the 18th century, and on the language spoken around Sikka in Flores Island, Indonesia. In nearby Larantuka, Portuguese is used for prayers in Holy Week rituals.\nThe Japanese–Portuguese dictionary \"Nippo Jisho\" (1603) was the first dictionary of Japanese in a European language, a product of Jesuit missionary activity in Japan. Building on the work of earlier Portuguese missionaries, the \"Dictionarium Anamiticum, Lusitanum et Latinum\" (Annamite–Portuguese–Latin dictionary) of Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) introduced the modern orthography of Vietnamese, which is based on the orthography of 17th-century Portuguese. The Romanization of Chinese was also influenced by the Portuguese language (among others), particularly regarding Chinese surnames; one example is \"Mei\". During 1583–88 Italian Jesuits Michele Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci created a Portuguese–Chinese dictionary—the first ever European–Chinese dictionary.\n\nFor instance, as Portuguese merchants were presumably the first to introduce the sweet orange in Europe, in several modern Indo-European languages the fruit has been named after them. Some examples are Albanian \"portokall\", Bosnian (archaic) \"portokal\", \"prtokal\", Bulgarian портокал (\"portokal\"), Greek πορτοκάλι (\"portokáli\"), Macedonian \"\", Persian پرتقال (\"porteghal\"), and Romanian \"portocală\". Related names can be found in other languages, such as Arabic البرتقال (\"burtuqāl\"), Georgian ფორთოხალი (\"p'ort'oxali\"), Turkish \"portakal\" and Amharic \"birtukan\". Also, in southern Italian dialects (e.g. Neapolitan), an orange is \"portogallo\" or \"purtuallo\", literally \"(the) Portuguese (one)\", in contrast to standard Italian \"arancia\".\n\nBeginning in the 16th century, the extensive contacts between Portuguese travelers and settlers, African and Asian slaves, and local populations led to the appearance of many pidgins with varying amounts of Portuguese influence. As each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations, they evolved into fully fledged creole languages, which remained in use in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America until the 18th century. Some Portuguese-based or Portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today, by over 3 million people worldwide, especially people of partial Portuguese ancestry.\n\nPortuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as French (especially that of Quebec), the Gallo-Italic languages, Occitan, Catalan and Franco-Provençal, unlike that of Spanish, which is similar to those of Sardinian and the Southern Italian dialects. Some would describe the phonology of Portuguese as a blend of Spanish, Gallo-Romance (e.g. French) and the languages of northern Italy (especially Genoese), but with a deeper Celtic influence.\n\nThere is a maximum of 9 oral vowels, 2 semivowels and 21 consonants; though some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes. There are also five nasal vowels, which some linguists regard as allophones of the oral vowels.\n\nLike Catalan and German, Portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables. Unstressed isolated vowels tend to be raised and sometimes centralized.\n\nPhonetic notes\n\nA notable aspect of the grammar of Portuguese is the verb. Morphologically, more verbal inflections from classical Latin have been preserved by Portuguese than by any other major Romance language. Portuguese and Spanish share very similar grammar. Portuguese also has some grammatical innovations not found in other Romance languages (except Galician and Fala):\n\n\nPortuguese is written with 26 letters of the Latin script, making use of five diacritics to denote stress, vowel height, contraction, nasalization, and etymological assibilation (acute accent, circumflex, grave accent, tilde, and cedilla). The trema was also formerly used in Brazilian Portuguese, and can still be encountered in words derived from proper names in other languages, such as Anhangüera and mülleriano. Accented characters and digraphs are not counted as separate letters for collation purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A presidential proclamation is an instrument that,\n\nProclamations issued by the U.S. President fall into two broad categories:\n\nUnless authorized by Congress, a President's proclamation does not have the force of law. If Congress were to pass an act that would take effect upon the happening of a contingent event, and subsequently the President proclaimed that the event happened, then the proclamation would have the force of law.\n\nPresidential proclamations are often dismissed as a practical tool for policy making because they are considered to be largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature. The administrative weight of these proclamations is upheld because they are often specifically authorized by congressional statute, making them \"delegated unilateral powers\". Their issuances have on occasion led to important political and historical consequences in the development of the United States. George Washington's Proclamation of Neutrality in 1793 and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 are some of America's most famous presidential proclamations in this regard. The legal weight of presidential proclamations suggests their importance to presidential governance.\n\nOther more recent policy-based proclamations have also made a substantial impact on economic and domestic policy, including Bill Clinton's declaration of federal lands for national monuments and George W. Bush's declaration of the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina as disaster areas.\n\nProclamations are also used, often contentiously, to grant presidential pardons. Recent notable pardon proclamations are Gerald Ford's pardon of former President Richard Nixon (1974), Jimmy Carter's pardon of Vietnam War draft evaders (1977) and George W. Bush's clemency of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby's prison sentence (2007).\n\nAlthough less significant in terms of public policy, proclamations are also used ceremonially by presidents to honor a group or situation or to call attention to certain issues or events. For instance, President George H. W. Bush issued a proclamation to honor veterans of World War II and Ronald Reagan called attention to the health of the nation's eyes by proclaiming a \"Save Your Vision Week\" and Proclamation 5497 recognizing \"National Theatre Week\".\n\n\n"}

He was one of the students who took over the US embassy in Tehran in 1979.\n\nAfter the revolution, Hajjarian was involved in the formation of the intelligence apparatus of the newly founded Islamic Republic. Through the 1980s, he worked in the ministry of intelligence, where his positions included vice minister for political affairs. In the late 1980s, he left the ministry, and established Center for Strategic Research under the presidency. That was where he played an important role in creating a new discourse based on democracy and rule of law for his generation of revolutionaries.\n\nWhen Mohammad Khatami was elected President in 1997, he appointed Hajjarian his political advisor. In 1999, he was elected to the city council of Tehran in the first city elections after the 1979 revolution. Hajjarian was also the editor of \"Sobh-e Emrooz\" newspaper, which was a strong advocate of Khatami's reforms. He was believed to be the source of information for many articles written by the investigative journalists, Akbar Ganji and Emadeddin Baghi. These included stories about the \"Chain murders\" of dissident intellectuals by members of Iran's intelligence ministry.\n\nHajjarian was one of the personal key factors of president Khatami. He was a member of the reformist elite and has leadership support role in reform movement. He joined the ministry of intelligence and national security (MINS) in 1984 and he leaves it in 1989. He worked also in the center of strategic studies. Working in such a place, he was able to invite some of the officials of MINS to join the reform movement. All of them try to develop the reform movement. Peoples like Akbar ganji, Mohsen Armin, Abbas abdi, Hamid Reza Jalaeipour, Muhammad Mousavi Khouiniha, Ebrahim Asghar zadeh and Mohsen Sazgaran are among those personals.\n\nIn March, 2000 he was shot in the face by a gunman on the doorstep of Tehran's city council. The would-be assassin fled on a motorcycle with an accomplice. The bullet entered through his left cheek and lodged in his neck, and put Hajjarian into a coma. During this time, groups of young Iranians kept vigil outside Sina hospital, where he was being treated. Hajjarian was badly paralyzed for life.\n\nHis assailant, Saeed Asgar, a young man who was reported to be a member of the Basij militia, was later arrested and sentenced to spend 15 years in jail. But he was released after spending only a short term in prison. Asgar was accompanied by Mohsen Morteza Majidi on a motorbike. Others, who were involved, include Mohammad Ali Moghaddami, Mehdi Rowghani, Mousa Jan Nesari, Ali Pourchaluei (possibly the one who shot Hajjarian), Saeed Golounani and Safar Maghsoudi.\n\nHis attempted assassination is thought to be associated with the exposure of the \"Chain murders\" in his \"Sobh Emrouz\" daily newspaper, and the \"key role\" he is believed to have played \"in bringing about ... damaging disclosures,\" both as the editor of the exposing newspaper and one of the few reformists likely to be a source of information about activity in the intelligence ministry. Consequently, \"some believe that remnants\" of the chain murder \"intelligence killer group may have been\" behind his attempted assassination.\n\nHajjarian slowly recovered somewhat from the shooting. By 2005, Hajjarian was still unable to speak with a clear voice and still using the wheelchair, although could walk with help. As of 2009 he still spoke with difficulty and was \"dependent on the constant care of doctors and family.\"\n\nHajjarian has used the term “\"dual sovereignty\"” as an analytic tool to describe the balance of power in the Islamic Republic's government system, in which there is a supposed split between the Supreme Leader and popularly elected officials, e.g. the President. The idea has been publicly denounced by Ali Khamenei in 2004, being called \"damaging and a deadly poison\" repeated by \"irrational people\".\n\nHe believes that a frontal assault on the fortresses of power is impractical. Hajjarian argued that domination of politics by clerics was wrong, but could be gradually eroded by \"mobilizing the masses and using them as bargaining chips with Iran's rulers.\" His strategy for the reform movement was described as extending the reformists \"reach by triangulating between the mass movement they represented and the autocratic state with which they shared power. He coined the phrase that would define the reformists’ strategy: “\"Pressure from below, negotiation at the top\".” The strategy remarks that by developing civil society and winning the battle of public opinion, the reform movement can gain enough strength to not only resist the hardliners, but also push for deep changes within the system via bargains with top officials unwilling to reform.\n\nHajjarian formulated the proposed gradual move to a favorable democratic system as “\"fortress to fortress triumph\"”, meaning that reformers should concentrate on weakening and capturing key institutions, i.e. fortresses of power, one by one.\n\nHajjarian argued that there is a way of combating the predominance of (rule of the Islamic jurist) by underlining the de facto secularization of religion by the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Khomeini. He allegedly showed the supremacy of politics as such over any religious norm when he said that the interests of the Islamic Republic are paramount in Islam and that zakat, salat, hajj, and everything else in Islam, are subordinant. This kind of decision, he states, means that politics are more important than religion and that this acknowledges the secularization of religion. In this context, he argues, it is possible to reassess velayat faqih and to reject its supremacy within the political field in Iran.\n\nAfter reformists lost their \"fortresses\", Hajjarian said in 2004 that the reforms program have been failed and now there are multiple choices for the Iranian people. One option is giving up and accepting the current situation. Another choice is apathy, followed by adopting defeatism—waiting for a possible foreign military action against Iran and regime change— or to let the developing lumpenproletariat in the society grow until they ignite a revolution in Iran. Hajjarian prefers what he calls the best alternative, which is to assume “\"reforms is dead, long live the reforms\"” and continue the reforms path patiently.\n\nOn 16 June 2009, four days after the disputed presidential election, it was reported that Hajjarian had been arrested. It was reported that he died in Evin prison under torture on 7 July. However, it was later added that he was still alive but had suffered a nervous breakdown on 8 July and was in critical condition in a military hospital in Tehran. Later, there were reports that he was still in Evin Prison, possibly in a clinic there, and that according to his wife, physician Vajiheh Marsoussi, his medical condition was \"deteriorating severely\" while in prison. Hajjarian was accused of having links with the British intelligence service on 25 August 2009.\n\nIn May 2015, Hajjarian was allowed to give a short speech at University of Tehran. According to the reformist \"Shargh\" Daily, enthusiasm for the speech was so great that seats were filled up hours before the event. In a note he gave to a student to read, Hajjarian stated that the 1997 presidential election were the reformists prevailed were the first since the 1979 Iranian revolution in which there was “a competition”, and that it “institutionalized” competition in the presidential elections, and introduced new debate on the issues of religion, economics and other foreign and domestic policies. But he believed those elections were an “exception” and doubtful of their repetition, \"though he did not explain why\", according to al-Monitor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1259289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1259289", "title": "Scout sign and salute", "text": "Scout sign and salute\n\nThe three-finger salute is used by members of Scout and Guide organizations around the world when greeting other Scouts and in respect of a national flag at ceremonies. In most situations, the salute is made with the right hand, palm face out, the thumb holding down the little finger, and with the fingertips on the brow of the head. There are some variations of the salute between national Scouting organizations and also within some programme sections.\n\nA \"half-salute\", known as the Scout Sign, is also used in certain situations. The hand is still held palm facing out, and the thumb holding the little finger, but the hand is held at the shoulder instead. Other organizations with historical ties to Scouting such as Scouts Royale Brotherhood and Alpha Phi Omega use it as well.\n\nIn his book, \"Scouting for Boys\", Robert Baden-Powell chose the three-finger salute for Scouts to represent the three aspects of the Scout Promise:\n\nCub Scout sections can use a two-finger salute, depending on the national Scouting organization they belong to. This is done to represent the two rules of the original Cub Scout / Wolf Cub law. In The Wolf Cub's Handbook, Baden-Powell wrote: \"Why two fingers? Well, you know what a Wolf's head looks like with two ears cocked up. It is used as the badge of the Wolf Cub. Your two fingers in the salute are the two ears of the Wolf.\"\" The salute is performed with the right hand.\n\nOriginally, Baden-Powell intended for Scouts to salute each other in greeting when they first saw each other for the first time using the \"secret sign\", or half-salute. This was regardless of whether the Scouts knew each other or not. Officers, such as Patrol Leaders, Scoutmasters, or members of the armed forces, were to be saluted with a full-salute.\n\nFull-salutes were also required at the hoisting of the Union Flag, the playing of the national anthem, or at funerals.\n\nIn Scouts Canada the Salute is rendered vertically, palm out similar to British Army/Commonwealth salutes, except if the member is a Sea Scout where it is palm in/angled down. (Traditionally, to hide your 'dirty hands' from the ship's captain). Beaver Scouts in Canada use a variant of the two-fingered sign with the fingers bent forwards forming \"teeth\". When they move up to Cub Scouts part of the ceremony sometimes includes a Scouter straightening the fingers to change from the Beaver to Cub sign.\n\nThe half-salute is used by Swiss Scouts when shaking (left) hands with other Scouts or leaders on greeting or parting.\n\nAdditional meaning of the thumb holding down the little finger as explained in Switzerland: the big and strong protects the weak and little.\n\nThe Scout Association uses the three-fingered salute for all sections, including Cub Scouts. The two-fingered Cub salute was abandoned by the Scout Association following a recommendation by the Advance Party Report in 1966, that \"there should be only one salute for the whole Movement\".\nThe Scout Sign is used while making or reaffirming the Beaver Scout, Cub Scout or Scout Promise and at no other time. The Baden-Powell Scouts' Association uses both the three and two fingered salutes. Girlguiding UK only uses the Guide Sign (half salute).\n\nAs a member of WFIS and part of the international Traditional Scouting movement. the scout sign and salute differs by section in the BPSA-US. The Timberwolf (cub) section uses the two-finger (spread) salute, and the two finger scout salute as defined in the 1938 PO&R, while the Pathfinder (scout) and Rovers use the traditional three-finger sign and salute.\n\nCub Scouts use the two finger Scout sign and salute— the sign is presented with the fingers apart to represent the ears of Akela the wolf. Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts, Venturers and Sea Scouts use the three finger sign and salute. The Scout Sign is performed with the upper arm parallel to the ground and the forearm vertical, forming a right angle at the elbow. The Scout Sign is used when reciting any of the ideals of the BSA such as the Scout Oath and Scout Law. It is also used to gain the attention of the group.\n\nThe salute is rendered in the American style with the palm in and is only used to salute the flag of the United States. Early BSA protocol required Scouts to salute each other, but this was discontinued in 1972.\n\nAs a member of WAGGGS, the Girl Scouts of the USA use the three-fingered sign at shoulder height. The three fingers represent the person's own spiritual beliefs, other people and the Girl Scout Law. This differs from the 1913 version where the first finger represented God and Country.\n\nAll World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts members share the three fingered sign, with the palm facing out held at shoulder height, elbow by the side and the thumb holding the little finger. This is used in numerous situations of respect including when making or reciting the Promise, receiving awards, honouring a flag, honouring the dead and meeting other Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. In the latter case, it may be used in conjunction with the left handshake.\n"}
{"id": "75595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75595", "title": "Serbian language", "text": "Serbian language\n\nSerbian ( / , ) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian language mainly used by Serbs. It is the official language of Serbia, the territory of Kosovo, and one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, it is a recognized minority language in Montenegro where it is spoken by the relative majority of the population, as well as in Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.\n\nStandard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian (more specifically on Šumadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovinian dialects), which is also the basis of Standard Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia, which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian.\n\nSerbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić, who created the alphabet on phonemic principles. The Latin alphabet was designed by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in 1830.\n\nSerbian is a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian, a Slavic language (Indo-European), of the South Slavic subgroup. Other standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian are Bosnian, Croatian, and Montenegrin. It has lower intelligibility with the Eastern South Slavic languages Bulgarian and Macedonian, than with Slovene (Slovene is part of the Western South Slavic subgroup, but there are still significant differences in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation to the standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian, although it is closer to the Kajkavian and Chakavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian).\n\nFigures of speakers according to countries:\n\nSerbian was the official language of Montenegro until October 2007 when the new Constitution of Montenegro replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties, the Montenegrin language was made the sole official language of the country, and Serbian was given the status of a recognised minority language along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Montenegrin census, 42.88% declare Serbian to be their native language, while Montenegrin is declared by 36.97% of the population.\n\nStandard Serbian language uses both Cyrillic (, ) and Latin script (, ). Serbian is a rare example of synchronic digraphia, a situation where all literate members of a society have two interchangeable writing systems available to them. Media and publishers typically select one alphabet or another.\n\nAlthough Serbian language authorities have recognized the official status of both scripts in contemporary Standard Serbian for more than half of a century now, due to historical reasons, the Cyrillic script was made the official script of Serbia's administration by the 2006 Constitution. However, the law does not regulate scripts in standard language, or standard language itself by any means, leaving the choice of script as a matter of personal preference and to the free will in all aspects of life (publishing, media, trade and commerce, etc.), except in government paperwork production and in official written communication with state officials, which have to be in Cyrillic. \n\nIn media, the public broadcaster, Radio Television of Serbia, predominantly uses the Cyrillic script whereas the privately run broadcasters, like RTV Pink, predominantly use the Latin script. Newspapers are found in both scripts. Outdoor signage, including road signs and commercial displays, predominately uses the Latin alphabet. Larger signs, especially those put up by the government, will often feature both alphabets.\n\nA survey from 2014 showed that 47% of the Serbian population favors the Latin alphabet whereas 36% favors the Cyrillic one.\n\nLatin script has become more and more popular in Serbia, as it is easier to input on phones and computers.\n\nThe sort order of the () alphabet:\n\nThe sort order of the () alphabet:\n\nSerbian is a highly inflected language, with grammatical morphology for nouns, pronouns and adjectives as well as verbs.\n\nSerbian nouns are classified into three declensional types, denoted largely by their nominative case endings as \"-a\" type, \"-i\" and \"-e\" type. Into each of these declensional types may fall nouns of any of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Each noun may be inflected to represent the noun's grammatical case, of which Serbian has seven:\n\n\nNouns are further inflected to represent the noun's number, singular or plural.\n\nPronouns, when used, are inflected along the same case and number morphology as nouns. Serbian is a pro-drop language, meaning that pronouns may be omitted from a sentence when their meaning is easily inferred from the text. In cases where pronouns may be dropped, they may also be used to add emphasis. For example:\n\nAdjectives in Serbian may be placed before or after the noun they modify, but must agree in number, gender and case with the modified noun.\n\nSerbian verbs are conjugated in four past forms—perfect, aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect—of which the last two have a very limited use (imperfect is still used in some dialects, but the majority of native Serbian speakers consider it archaic), one future tense (also known as the first future tense, as opposed to the second future tense or the future exact, which is considered a tense of the conditional mood by some contemporary linguists), and one present tense. These are the tenses of the indicative mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the imperative mood. The conditional mood has two more tenses: the first conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses) and the second conditional (without use in the spoken language—it should be used for impossible conditional clauses). Serbian has active and passive voice.\n\nAs for the non-finite verb forms, Serbian has one infinitive, two adjectival participles (the active and the passive), and two adverbial participles (the present and the past).\n\nMost Serbian words are of native Slavic lexical stock, tracing back to the Proto-Slavic language. There are many loanwords from different languages, reflecting cultural interaction throughout history. Notable loanwords were borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, Russian, and German.\n\nSerbian literature emerged in the Middle Ages, and included such works as \"Miroslavljevo jevanđelje\" (Miroslav's Gospel) in 1192 and \"Dušanov zakonik\" (Dušan's Code) in 1349. Little secular medieval literature has been preserved, but what there is shows that it was in accord with its time; for example, \"Serbian Alexandride\", a book about Alexander the Great, and a translation of \"Tristan and Iseult\" into Serbian. Although not belonging to the literature proper, the corpus of Serbian literacy in the 14th and 15th centuries contains numerous legal, commercial and administrative texts with marked presence of Serbian vernacular juxtaposed on the matrix of Serbian Church Slavonic.\n\nBy the beginning of the 14th century, Serbian language, which was so rigorously proscribed by earlier local lows, becomes the mother-tongue of the Republic of Ragusa. However, despite her wealthy citizens speaking Serbian dialect of Dubrovnik in their family circles, they sent their children to Florentine schools to acquire perfect knolledge of Italian. Since the beginning of the XIII century, entire official correspondence of Dubrovnik with states in the hinterland was conducted in Serbian language.\n\nIn the mid-15th century, Serbia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and for the next 400 years there was no opportunity for the creation of secular written literature. However, some of the greatest literary works in Serbian come from this time, in the form of oral literature, the most notable form being Serbian epic poetry. The epic poems were mainly written down in the 19th century, and preserved in oral tradition up to the 1950s, a few centuries or even a millennium longer than by most other \"epic folks\". Goethe and Jacob Grimm learned Serbian in order to read Serbian epic poetry in the original. By the end of the 18th century, the written literature had become estranged from the spoken language. In the second half of the 18th century, the new language appeared, called Slavonic-Serbian. This artificial idiom superseded the works of poets and historians like Gavrilo Stefanović Venclović, who wrote in essentially modern Serbian in the 1720s. These vernacular compositions have remained cloistered from the general public and received due attention only with the advent of modern literary historians and writers like Milorad Pavić. In the early 19th century, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić promoted the spoken language of the people as a literary norm.\n\nThe dialects of Serbo-Croatian, regarded Serbian (traditionally spoken by Serbs), include:\n\nVuk Karadžić's \"Srpski rječnik\", first published in 1818, is the earliest dictionary of modern literary Serbian. The \"Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika\" (I–XXIII), published by the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts from 1880 to 1976, is the only general historical dictionary of Serbo-Croatian. Its first editor was Đuro Daničić, followed by Pero Budmani and the famous Vukovian Tomislav Maretić. The sources of this dictionary are, especially in the first volumes, mainly Štokavian. There are older, pre-standard dictionaries, such as the 1791 German–Serbian dictionary.\n\n\nThe standard and the only completed etymological dictionary of Serbian is the \"Skok\", written by the Croatian linguist Petar Skok: \"Etimologijski rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika\" (\"Etymological Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian\"). I-IV. Zagreb 1971–1974.\n\nThere is also a new monumental \"Etimološki rečnik srpskog jezika\" (Etymological Dictionary of Serbian). So far, two volumes have been published: I (with words on A-), and II (Ba-Bd).\n\nThere are specialized etymological dictionaries for German, Italian, Croatian, Turkish, Greek, Hungarian, Russian, English and other loanwords (cf. chapter \"word origin\").\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "571993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571993", "title": "Simulcast", "text": "Simulcast\n\nSimulcast (a portmanteau of simultaneous broadcast) is the broadcasting of programs or events across more than one medium, or more than one service on the same medium, at exactly the same time (that is, simultaneously). For example, Absolute Radio is simulcast on both AM and on satellite radio. Likewise, the BBC's Prom concerts were formerly simulcast on both BBC Radio 3 and BBC Television. Another application is the transmission of the original-language soundtrack of movies or TV series over local or Internet radio, with the television broadcast having been dubbed into a local language.\n\nBefore launching stereo radio, experiments were conducted by transmitting left and right channels on different radio channels. The earliest recorded found was a broadcast by the BBC in 1926 of a Halle Orchestra concert from Manchester, using the wavelengths of the regional stations and Daventry. (Practical Television, April 1964, p305. see http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Practical/Television/60s/Practical-Television-1964-04.pdf)\n\nIn its earliest days the BBC often transmitted the same programme on the \"National Service\" and the \"Regional Network\".\n\nBetween 1990 and 1994 the BBC broadcast a channel of entertainment (Radio 5) which offered a wide range of simulcasts, taking programs from the BBC World Service and Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4 for simultaneous broadcast.\n\nBefore stereo TV sound transmission was possible, simulcasting on TV and Radio was a method of effectively transmitting \"stereo\" sound to music TV broadcasts. The band Grateful Dead and their concert \"Great Canadian Train Ride\" in 1970 was the first TV broadcast of a live concert with FM simulcast. In the 1970s WPXI in Pittsburgh broadcast a live Boz Scaggs performance which had the audio simultaneously broadcast on two FM radio stations to create a quadrophonic sound, the first of its kind. The first such transmission in the United Kingdom was in 1975, when the BBC broadcast a recording of Van Morrison's London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2 (see \"It's Too Late to Stop Now\").\n\nSimilarly, in the 1980s, before Multichannel Television Sound or home theater was commonplace in American households, broadcasters would air a high fidelity version of a television program's audio portion over FM stereo simultaneous with the television broadcast. PBS stations were the most likely to use this technique, especially when airing a live concert. It was also a way of allowing MTV and similar music channels to run stereo sound through the cable-TV network. This method required a stereo FM transmitter modulating MTV's stereo soundtrack through the cable-TV network, and customers connecting their FM receiver's antenna input to the cable-TV outlet. They would then tune the FM receiver to the specified frequency that would be published in documentation supplied by the cable-TV provider.\n\nWith the introduction of commercial FM stations in Australia in July 1980, commercial TV channels began simulcasting some music based programs with the new commercial FM stations and continued to do so into the early 1990s. These were initially rock based programs, such as late night music video shows and rock concerts, but later included some major rock musicals such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Blues Brothers when they first aired on TV. During the mid 1980s the final Australian concert of several major rock artists such as Dire Straits were simulcast live on a commercial TV and FM station. The ABC also simulcast some programs on ABC Television and ABC FM, including the final concert of Elton John with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe first ever concert \"simulcast\" was Frank Zappa's Halloween shows (October 31, 1981), live from NYC's Palladium and shown on MTV with the audio-only portion simulcast over the FM \"Starfleet Radio\" network. Engineered by Mark Pinske with the UMRK mobile recording truck. A later, notable application for simulcasting in this context was the Live Aid telethon concert that was broadcast around the world on July 13, 1985. Most destinations where this concert was broadcast had the concert simulcast by at least one TV network and at least one of the local FM stations.\n\nMost stereo-capable video recorders made through the 1980s and early 1990s had a \"simulcast\" recording mode where they recorded video signals from the built-in TV tuner and audio signals from the VCR's audio line-in connectors. This was to allow one to connect a stereo FM tuner that is tuned to the simulcast frequency to the VCR's audio input in order to record the stereo sound of a TV program that would otherwise be recorded in mono. The function was primarily necessary with stereo VCRs that didn't have a stereo TV tuner or were operated in areas where stereo TV broadcasting wasn't in place. This was typically selected through the user setting the input selector to \"Simulcast\" or \"Radio\" mode or, in the case of some JVC units, the user setting another \"audio input\" switch from \"TV\" or \"Tuner\" to \"Line\".\n\nIn the mid to late 1990s, video game developer Nintendo utilized simulcasting to provide enhanced orchestral scoring and voice-acting for the first ever \"integrated radio-games\" – its Satellaview video games. Whereas digital game data was broadcast to the Satellaview unit to provide the basic game and game sounds, Nintendo's partner, satellite radio company St.GIGA, simultaneously broadcast the musical and vocal portion of the game via radio. These two streams were combined at the Satellaview to provide a unified audiotrack analogous to stereo.\n\nThe term \"simulcast\" (describing simultaneous radio/television broadcast) was coined in 1948 by a press agent at WCAU-TV, Philadelphia. NBC and CBS had begun broadcasting a few programs both to their established nationwide radio audience and to the much smaller—though steadily-growing—television audience. NBC's \"Voice of Firestone\" was an early example. Toscanini's NBC Symphony performance of 15 March 1952 is perhaps a first instance of radio/TV simulcasting of a concert, predating the much-heralded rock concert simulcasts beginning in the 1980s.\n\nPresently, in the United States, simulcast most often refers to the practice of offering the same programming on an FM and AM station owned by the same entity, in order to cut costs. With the advent of solid state AM transmitters and computers, it has become very easy for AM stations to broadcast a different format without additional cost; therefore, simulcast between FM/AM combinations are rarely heard today outside of rural areas, and in urban areas, where often the talk or all-news radio format of an AM station is simulcast on FM, mainly for the convenience of office buildings in urban cores which easily block AM signals.\n\nDuring apartheid in South Africa, many foreign programmes on SABC television were dubbed in Afrikaans. The original soundtrack, usually in English, but sometimes in German or Dutch was available on the Radio 2000 service. This could be selected using a button labeled simulcast on many televisions manufactured before 1995.\n\nRadio programs have been simulcast on television since the invention thereof however, as of recent, perhaps the most visible example of radio shows on television is \"The Howard Stern Show\", which currently airs on Sirius Satellite Radio as well as Howard TV. Another prominent radio show that was simulcast on television is \"Imus in the Morning\", which until the simulcast ended in 2015, aired throughout the years on MSNBC, RFD-TV and Fox Business Network, in addition to its radio broadcast distributed by Citadel Media. Multiple sports talk radio shows, including \"Mike & Mike\", \"The Herd with Colin Cowherd\" and \"Boomer and Carton\" also are carried on television, saving those networks the burden of having to air encores of sporting events or other paid sports programming which may draw lower audiences.\n\nIn professional wrestling, a simulcast happened on March 26, 2001 between \"WWF Raw is War\" and \"WCW Monday Nitro\" upon WWE's purchase of WCW's assets to merge the storylines of the two wrestling promotions, which was the last episode of \"Monday Nitro\".\n\nIn another case, popular programs will be aired simultaneously on different services in adjacent countries, such as \"The Simpsons\", airing Sunday evenings at 8:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific times) on both Fox in the United States and Global in Canada. \"Simulcast\" is often a colloquial term for the related Canadian practice of simultaneous substitution (simsub).\n\nSimulcasts are also used for the purposes of television ratings, mainly with awards ceremonies such as the MTV Video Music Awards and the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards where the ceremony airs on other sister channels in the same corporate family. These allow a bulk ratings number to be competed which allows for more homes to be calculated in a final rating, along with removing any in-house competition, with each of the networks carrying the same ceremony and same advertising. Another example is a \"roadblock strategy\", where a family of networks will air the premiere of a new series, music video or other event such as a telethon at the same time to maximize their audiences. During major breaking news events, a simulcast of the Fox News Channel is aired on the Fox broadcast network and Fox Business Network.\n\n\"Live Simulcast\" is also used throughout South America for a real-time live broadcasting from the USA, where it differs from just a live broadcasting in that, on the former case, the event is being broadcast live while it is happening in real time (e.g. the NFL games), while, the latter, a show may be a live recording but not necessarily being broadcast in real time of when the event took place (e.g. a live concert recording). Yet, local live productions (soccer games, for instance) being broadcast in real time in South America are often just called live, without the use of the word simulcast.\n\nIn sports, such as American football and baseball, simulcasts are when a single announcer broadcasts play-by-play coverage both over television and radio. The practice was common in the early years of television, but since the 1980s, most teams have used a separate team for television and for radio.\n\nAs all NFL television broadcasts are done by the national networks or via cable, there are no regular TV-to-radio football simulcasts. However, NFL rules require that games airing on cable and satellite networks (ESPN, NFL Network) be simulcast on local over-air TV stations in markets serving the two local teams participating in each game.\n\nSimilarly, no current National Basketball Association teams use a simulcast. Al McCoy (Phoenix), Chick Hearn (Los Angeles), Kevin Calabro (Seattle) and Rod Hundley (Utah) were the last NBA team broadcasters to simulcast.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, until his retirement in 2016, Vin Scully continued the practice; however, he simulcasted only the first three innings of Los Angeles Dodgers games at Dodger Stadium and other National League Western Division parks. As a result of his retirement, no MLB team uses a simulcast now.\n\nThe practice is more prevalent in the National Hockey League where 2 teams currently simulcast:\n\nSimulcasts via satellite can be a challenge, as there is a significant delay because of the distance - nearly round-trip - involved. Anything involving video compression (and to some extent audio data compression) also has an additional significant delay, which is noticeable when watching local TV stations on direct-broadcast satellites. Even though the process is not instantaneous, this is still considered a simulcast because it is not intentionally stored anywhere.\n\nIn horse racing, a simulcast is a broadcast of a horse race which allows wagering at two or more sites; the simulcast often involves the transmission of wagering information to a central site, so that all bettors may bet in the same betting pool, as well as the broadcast of the race.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants simulcast with the Oakland Athletics while playing each other on their respective stations and commercials with a mix of broadcasters from both teams.\n\nOn cable television systems, analog-digital simulcasting (ADS) means that analog channels are duplicated as digital subchannels. Digital tuners are programmed to use the digital subchannel instead of the analog. This allows for smaller, cheaper cable boxes by eliminating the analog tuner and some analog circuitry. On DVRs, it eliminates the need for an MPEG encoder to convert the analog signal to digital for recording. The primary advantage is the elimination of interference, and as analog channels are dropped, the ability to put 10 or more SDTV (or two HDTV, or various other combinations) channels in its place. The primary drawback is the common problem of over-compression (quantity over quality) resulting in fuzzy pictures and pixelation.\n\nIn universities with multiple campuses, simulcasting may be used for a single teacher to teach class to students in two or more locations at the same time, using videoconferencing equipment.\n\nIn many public safety agencies, simulcast refers to the broadcasting of the same transmission on the same frequency from multiple towers either simultaneously, or offset by a fixed number of microseconds. This allows for a larger coverage area without the need for a large number of channels, resulting in increased spectral efficiency. This comes at the cost of overall poorer voice quality, as multiple sources increase multipath interference significantly, resulting in what is called simulcast distortion.\n\nWith some of the latest Simulcast control equipment for FM radio networks, the distortion experienced is almost in-audible to the human ear. With the introduction of Line Equalisation Modules and Tone Generation Modules, the phasing advance and retard is so well calculated that the distortion is almost entirely averted.\n\nThe Tone Generation Module (or TGM) generates a pilot tone at 3300 Hz which is then sampled by the Line Equalisation Module (or LEM) which each channel on each radio high site has 2 of located back at the main control site. This then determines the phase shift in the signal and adjusts the transmission accordingly such that all the overlap areas in transmission are in phase with each other.\n\n"}

Singaporeans, even those of the same ethnic group, have many different first languages and cultures. For example, in 2005, among Chinese Singaporeans, nearly a third spoke English as their main language at home while almost half spoke Mandarin, and the rest spoke various mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese. In the Indian community, most Singaporeans of Indian descent speak either English or Tamil at home. The English language is now the most popular medium of communication among students from primary school to university. Many families use two or three languages on a regular basis, and English is often one of them. In the past, some children received fewer years of English education than others. As such, the level of fluency in English among residents in Singapore varies greatly from person to person.\n\nSingapore English can be classified into Singapore Standard English (SSE) and Singapore Colloquial English (Singlish). The language consists of three sociolects; Acrolect, Mesolect, and Basilect. Both Acrolect and Mesolect are regarded as Standard Singapore English, while Basilect is considered as Singlish. \n\nSingaporeans vary their language according to social situations (Pakir 1991) and attitudes that they want to convey (Poedjosoedarmo 1993). The better educated Singaporeans who have a \"higher\" standard of English, tend to speak \"Standard\" Singapore English (the acrolect). On the other hand, and typically the less-educated or Singaporeans whose first language isn't English, speak Singlish (the basilect). Gupta (1994) said that most Singaporean speakers systematically alternate between colloquial and formal language depending on the formality of the situation. The constant use of both SSE and Singlish has resulted in the gradual emergence of a mesolect, an intermediate form of Singapore English, half-way between formal and informal Singapore English.\n\nStandard Singapore English is the standard form of English used in Singapore. It generally resembles British English and is often used in more formal settings such as the workplace or when communicating with people of higher authority such as teachers, bosses and government officials. Singapore English acts as the \"bridge\" among different ethnic groups in Singapore Standard Singapore English retains British spelling and grammar..\n\nThe British established a trading post on the island of Singapore in 1819, and the population grew rapidly thereafter, attracting many immigrants from Chinese provinces and from India. The roots of Standard Singapore English derive from nearly a century and a half of British control. Its local character seems to have developed early in the English-medium schools of the 19th and early-20th centuries, where the teachers often came from India and Ceylon, as well as from various parts of Europe and from the United States of America. By 1900 Eurasians and other locals were employed as teachers. Apart from a period of Japanese occupation (1942-1945), Singapore remained a British colony until 1963, when it joined the Malaysian Federation, but this proved a short-lived alliance, largely due to ethnic rivalries. Since its expulsion from the Federation in 1965, Singapore has operated as an independent city-state. English served as the administrative language of the British colonial government, and when Singapore gained self-government in 1959 and independence in 1965, the Singaporean government decided to keep English as the main language to maximise economic prosperity. The use of English as the nation's first language serves to bridge the gap between the diverse ethnic groups in Singapore; English operates as the \"lingua franca\" of the nation. The use of English - as the global language for commerce, technology and science - also helped to expedite Singapore's development and integration into the global economy. Public schools use English as the main language of instruction, although students are also required to receive part of their instruction in their mother tongue; placement in such courses is based on ethnicity and not without controversy.\nThe standard Singaporean accent used to be officially RP. However, in recent decades, a standard Singaporean accent, quite independent of any external standard, including RP, started to emerge. A 2003 study by the National Institute of Education in Singapore suggests that a standard Singaporean pronunciation is emerging and is on the cusp of being standardised.\nSingaporean accents can be said to be largely non-rhotic.\n\nThe wide use of Singlish led the government to launch the Speak Good English movement in Singapore in 2000 in an attempt to replace Singlish with Standard English. This movement was made to show the need for Singaporeans to speak Standard English. Nowadays, all children in schools are being taught Standard English with one of the other official languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil) being taught as a second language. In Singapore, English is a “working language” that serves the economy and development and is associated with the broader global community. Meanwhile, the rest are “mother tongues” that are associated with the country’s culture. Speaking Standard English also helps Singaporeans communicate and express themselves in their everyday life.\n\nThe Singaporean government recently made an announcement named “Speak Good English Movement brings fun back to Grammar and good English” where the strategies used to promote their program are explained. Specifically, it would release a series of videos that demystify the difficulty and dullness of the grammatical rules of the English language. These videos provide a more humorous approach to learning basic grammar rules. Singaporeans will now be able to practise the grammatical rules in both written and spoken English thanks to a more interactive approach.\nLike most Commonwealth countries outside of Canada and Australia, the accents of most reasonably educated Singaporeans who speak English as their first language are more similar to British Received Pronunciation (RP) than General American, although immediately noticeable differences exist. This is the same for people who speak English as their second language.\n\nAlthough Standard Singapore English (SSE) is mainly influenced by British English and, recently, American English, there are other languages that also contribute to its use on a regular basis. The majority of Singaporeans speak more than one language, with many speaking three to four. Most Singaporean children are brought up bilingual. They are introduced to Malay, Chinese, Tamil, or Singapore Colloquial English (Singlish) as their native languages, depending on their families' ethnic backgrounds and/or socioeconomic status. They also acquire those languages from interacting with friends in school and other places. Naturally, the presence of other languages in Singapore has influenced Singapore English, something particularly apparent in Singlish.\n\nBoth Singapore English and Singapore colloquial English are used with multiple accents. Words from Malay, Chinese, and Tamil are also borrowed, if not code-switched, into Singapore English. For example, the Malay words “makan” (to eat), “habis” (finished), and the Hokkien word \"kiasu\" are constantly used and adopted to SE vocabularies, to the point that Singaporeans are not necessarily aware of which language those words are from. Furthermore, the word “kiasu” has been used in the Singapore press since 2000 without being italicised; Kiasu means \"always wanting the best for oneself and willing to try hard to get it\". In another journal, \"Kiasu\" is also defined as 'characterized by a grasping or selfish attitude arising from a fear of missing out on something' (usu. adj., definition from OED (Simpson and Weiner 2000); Hokkien kia(n)su).\n\nA wide range of foreign English dialects can be heard in Singapore. American and British accents are often heard on local television and radio due to the frequent airing of foreign television programmes. The Indian accent, spoken by Indian expatriates, can also be heard daily on the streets of Singapore. In addition, accents originating from Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Australia and Malaysia, with some possibly from Latin American countries, can also be heard among the population.\n\nSinglish is an English-based creole language spoken in Singapore. Unlike SSE, Singlish includes many discourse particles and loan words from Malay, Mandarin and Hokkien. Many of such loan words include swear words, such as Kanina and Chee Bai. Hence, it is commonly regarded with low prestige in the country and not used in formal communication.\n\nHowever, Singlish has been used in several locally produced films, including \"Army Daze\", \"Mee Pok Man\" and \"Talking Cock the Movie\", among others. Some local sitcoms, in particular \"Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd\", also feature extensive use of Singlish.\n\nThe proliferation of Singlish has been controversial and the use of Singlish is not endorsed by the government. Singapore's first two prime ministers, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have publicly declared that Singlish is a substandard variety that handicaps Singaporeans, presents an obstacle to learning standard English, and renders the speaker incomprehensible to everyone except another Singlish speaker. The country's third and current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, has also said that Singlish should not be part of Singapore's identity. In addition, the government launched the Speak Good English Movement in 2000 to encourage Singaporeans to speak proper English.\n\nDespite strong criticisms of Singlish, linguist David Yoong has put forward the argument that \"Singaporeans who subscribe to Singlish and have a positive attitude towards the code see Singlish as a language that transcends social barriers\" and that the language can be used to \"forge rapport and, perhaps more importantly, the Singaporean identity\". Sociolinguist Anthea Fraser Gupta also argues that Singlish and standard English can and do co-exist, saying that \"there is no evidence that the presence of Singlish causes damage to standard English\".\n\nIn 2010, speakers of English in Singapore were classified into five different groups: \n\n, English is the most commonly spoken language in all Singaporean homes. One effect of mass immigration into Singapore since 2000, especially from China, has been to increase the proportion of the population to whom English is a foreign language. The trend favours an increasing use of English, and stability in Mandarin use at the expense of other varieties of Chinese (apparently as the Chinese population switches first to Mandarin, then to English), whilst Malay use slowly erodes and Tamil use remains stable.\n\nIn 2010, 52% of Chinese children and 26% of Malay children aged between 5 and 14 speak English at home, as compared to 36% and 9.4% respectively in 2000.\n\nEnglish is one of Singapore's four official languages, along with Malay, Chinese and Tamil. The national language is Malay for historical reasons, as Singapore was part of the Johor Sultanate until the 19th century and was briefly in union with Malaysia between 1963 and 1965. All official signs, legislation and documents are required to be in English, although translations in the other official languages are sometimes included. Under the education system, English is the language of instruction for nearly all subjects except the official Mother Tongue languages (the other three official languages) and the literatures of those languages.\n\n"}
{"id": "29084283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29084283", "title": "Social undermining", "text": "Social undermining\n\nSocial undermining is the expression of negative emotions directed towards a particular person or negative evaluations of the person as a way to prevent the person from achieving his or her goals. This behavior can often be attributed to certain feelings, such as dislike or anger. The negative evaluation of the person may involve criticizing his or her actions, efforts or characteristics. Social undermining is seen in relationships between family members, friends, personal relationships and co-workers. Social undermining can affect a person's mental health, including an increase in depressive symptoms. This behavior is only considered social undermining if the person's perceived action is intended to hinder their target. When social undermining is seen in the work environment the behavior is used to hinder the co-worker's ability to establish and maintain a positive interpersonal relationship, success and a good reputation. Examples of how an employee can use social undermining in the work environment are behaviors that are used to delay the work of co-workers, to make them look bad or slow them down, competing with co-workers to gain status and recognition and giving co-workers incorrect or even misleading information about a particular job.\n\nAccording to Duffy, Gangster, and Pagon, 2002, the definition of social undermining in a workplace is, behavior intended to hinder over time and not allowing a person to establish or maintain positive interpersonal relationships.\n\nSocial undermining has been very effective in the workplace. Various aspects of social undermining have affected the workplace and specific races. In workplaces, social undermining has connection with social interaction. Research has shown if a person has a supportive environment in their work setting, they are more likely to have a more satisfied life. Research has shown that social undermining exists in a separate and distinct continuum when looking at positive workplace behavior (e.g. social support).\n\nSocial undermining can arise through interactions with co-workers and supervisors; these interactions have an effect on the workers that are being undermined and can affect their work performance. Vinokur found that those who alleged to have social undermining in the workplace reported to have poorer mental health and experienced less well-being. The study shows that undermining has a significant role in worker-supervisor and co-worker relationship and that it leads to various different outcomes such as feelings of irritability, anxiety, depersonalization, and depression. It shows that social undermining affects a person's work ethics and well being.\n\nVarious different empirical studies have found that undermining has three specific factors that develop counterfactual thoughts. For example: \"what would my life be like if I were not the target of undermining?\" These studies' findings indicate that \"this rift plays a role in determining the magnitude of the employee's reaction to the event by making the deprived state more salient\".\n\nBehaviors of social undermining can affect a person and his or her perceptions. The study conducted by Gant et al. addressed African American workers' perceptions of co-workers and supervisors. The research by Duffy, Gangster, Shaw, Johnson, and Pagon addressed the fairness theory introduced by Folger and Cropanzano 1998. The fairness theory suggests that when individuals face negative situations (such as being undermined by coworkers or supervision) they make cognitive comparisons known as counterfactual thoughts; i.e., they compare what actually happened to what might have been. The results show that social undermining is closely related to attitudes and behavior regarding one person being or feeling \"singled out\".\n\nWhile social undermining can affect a person's behavior and attitude on their job, it can also bring about envy. Envy can have a positive or negative effect: positive effects include increased performance or attempts at self-improvement. However, envy can have some very harmful effects, including aggression or crime. It can lead to belittling, gossip, withholding information, and giving someone the silent treatment.\n\nAbusive supervision can arise in different areas such as in the household, at school, and at a workplace. \"Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome\" ; \"Workplace violence has combination of situational and personal factors\" (e.g., Barling, 1996). The study that was conducted looked at the link between abusive supervision and different workplace events. Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to \"flow downhill\"; a supervisor is perceived as abusive.\n\nResearch has shown that \"abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors\" behavior towards them over a period of time. For example, abusive supervision includes a \"boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate.\n\nHostile attribution bias is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to project blame on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates' reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.\n\nWhen a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is \"redirection of a [person's] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target\" (Tedeschi & Norman, 1985, p. 30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.\n\nBottom line is defined as profits or losses of a business. Greenbaum and colleagues found that some employees tend to focus on a bottom-line outcome, which may be related to their tendency to engage in social undermining behavior. Employees with a bottom line mentality (BLM) tend to focus on only the bottom line, and to neglect other outcomes of their actions, including interpersonal consequences. Research has found that a bottom-line mentality can cause a problem, especially if the employer uses BLM as an objective for them to strive for. If someone is hurt by their actions it is not a priority for those with a BLM.\n\nEmployees that have a BLM may learn these actions from their supervisors. BLMs can cause rivalries within the organization since the employee may feel as if the organization should have a winner or loser when it comes to completing work. Employees with this approach think of their work as a game where the winner takes all instead of working with other employees to make sure everyone is contributing to the work that needs to be completed. The competitiveness that is created between the coworkers is to attain bottom-line outcomes. When the employees are trying to attain bottom-line outcomes, with this winner-take-all mentality, they begin to want their co-workers to fail as that consequently means, to them, they, the undermining employee, must be succeeding. The supervisor's BLM causes employee social undermining. This happens because the employees may role-model after the adopted supervisor's BLM. Employee personality also plays a role in the relationship between BLM and undermining. Employees that have confidence in their work ability rely on their work ethic while employees who are low in confidence are more likely to engage in social undermining behavior to make themselves look better when it comes to the bottom line of success.\n\nResearch suggests that whether or not someone engages in social support or social undermining depends upon their own goals. Those with compassionate goals are more likely to be supportive of others, while those who have more selfish motives believe that people should take care of themselves. When people have goals to preserve their own self-image this can undermine their compassionate goals and make them less supportive.\n\nResearch has shown that social undermining can have an effect on a person's health. It has been shown that social undermining can cause depressive symptoms. Depending on the relationship between a patient and their loved one, the loved one can support or undermine the patient and can even do both within the same interaction, which can increase the depressive symptoms. Creating more social support can improve treatment outcomes of a patient depending on the type of stress level the person is enduring.\n\nResearch by Joseph et al. found that when participants are exposed to high levels of social undermining and even high levels of social support it can improve the participants course of antidepressive treatment. High levels of social support and social undermining could reduce and also cause remission of the participant's depressive symptoms. The study found that African American participants who had low levels of social undermining were able to fare better than the Caucasians participants in reducing their symptoms. When both groups of participants were given high levels of social undermining the African American participants had fewer achievements in symptom reduction, while the Caucasians participants had the reverse effect of symptom reduction.\n\nA 2007 study conducted by Benyamini, Medalion and Garfinkel showed that support from a spouse while being seriously ill helped a person to cope with their illness. Their study used patients who had heart disease. The intention of the study was to find if positive and negative interactions between the patients who have heart disease and their spouse can cause spouse support or spouse undermining. The researchers found that when the patient considered their illness as being negative (e.g., especially painful or likely to be chronic) they tended to want more support from the spouse and tended to feel as if their spouse was not providing sufficient support. This could cause the patient to believe that they were experiencing social undermining. Other times, the partner's actions could cause the patient to feel as if the spouse was acting critical towards them. This could turn into social undermining, causing the spouse to think that the patient was not taking their condition seriously. When the spouse showed that the illness was serious, it could sometimes cause the spouse to become over-protective of the partner. This could also cause the spouse to be critical of their partner behavior, and the partner could provide less support for the patient. The results of the study were that when a spouse had negative views of the illness, he or she engaged in both more support and more undermining.\n\nResearch conducted by Horwitz et al. (1998) found that spouse undermining was almost twice as large as the effect for support. For example, a spouse that shows behaviors of withdrawal, avoidance and being overly critical can cause psychological distress in a relationship. This in turn causes stress that increases the depressive symptoms on individuals that have endure high levels of social undermining. This can happen, because the support that a person can get from their spouse compared to a close friend is more exclusive and generally involves more frequent and emotionally intense interactions (Cutrone 1996; Vinokur & Vinokur & Vinokur- Kaplan, 1990) and depending on their relationship that can influence the social support or even the social undermining that affect the relationship.\n\nCranford found that spouse undermining and not spouse support can increase depressive symptoms within that relationship. Social undermining has been found to be a stronger indicator for psychological adaption than social support. When there is social undermining in a relationship it can have fatal effects on the spouse's ability to deal with other stressors. It can also lead to an increase of wishful thinking, poor psychological adjustment, maladaptive coping behaviors, and even decrease adaptive coping behaviors. This can give more attention to coping resources and it takes away from other stressors which causes the couple to have fewer chances resolving their problems. If the couple cannot resolve their problems it can cause marital conflict. Social undermining within the relationship can cause negative effects on the spouse physical health and can make the spouse vulnerable to different stressors. This can lead to depressive symptoms that can lessen the spouse self-esteem.\n\nResearch has shown that partners that offer social support can also offer social undermining. An example of this is when family members try to undermine parenting styles in order to raise healthy children. \nAnother study found that participants who endure social undermining regarding their eating and exercise behavior, try to ignore the pressure, and the undermining affects their exercise decisions more than eating decisions.\n\nMarket, Stanforth, and Garcia found that social undermining used by family members, friends and coworkers can affect daily activities. Social undermining can affect exercise routines when their exercise routines can conflict with seeing friends or even coworkers. Friends and coworkers can influence the person to skip their exercise, even when a spouse is concerned about their well being. The study also showed that social undermining can affect men and women differently. Men tend to feel as if they can overcome social undermining because they were still able to make a healthy eating decision. Women have stated that they tend to make bad eating decision when they are eating with other people such as their friends. Social undermining pressures can cause serious challenges when a person is trying to maintain healthy eating and trying to stay active. The study found that people that engage in undermining behavior tend to feel guilty about their own unhealthy behavior and may feel jealous of someone else maintaining their healthy behavior when they cannot achieve the same behavior. The study also suggests when a person is satisfied with their weight it can help the person resist against social undermining. By being satisfied with one's own weight can reduce the likelihood of social undermining in social situations when having dinner with friends. So when a person is not satisfied with their weight they receive more social undermining pressures from the people around them.\n\nSocial undermining and social support can have opposite effects on a person that can be negative or positive depending on the person or even the relationship. Being in a close relationship can provide a person both social undermining and social support. Example of these relationships can be an abusive relationship that offers low support and high undermining. A typical healthy close relationship has high support and low undermining. In a relationship between an adolescent and a parent, their relationship can offer high levels of support and even undermining. Depending on the relationship, patterns can change over time based on the characteristics and the situation of the relationship. Whether a relationship is positive or negative can have devastating effects.\n\nSocial support can give a person coping resources that can reduce threat in a stressful situation. In a relationship if a partner has lower status or even lower power social undermining becomes more of threat for the relationship. Research concludes that social undermining has a greater impact on a person's mental health than social support.\n\nVinokur and van Ryn used unemployed participants and some of the participants were reemployed to look at the impact that social support and social undermining can have on a person's mental health during economic hardships. They suggest that although the support and undermining are inversely and strongly correlated they do not form the same factor but constitute empirically distinct constructs. The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, and undermining on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support and social undermining did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health. Vinokur and Ryn(1993) found that social support and undermining were shown in longitudinal design even when prior levels of mental health and the contribution of another critical stressful factor. Social support and undermining had a dynamic pattern influence on mental health.\n\nThe results showed that social support has weak positive effect while social undermining has more volatile effects. Even though the study found that a high level of social undermining has significant effects on mental health when the high levels are reduced there is an improvement in the person mental health over a period of time. In the study participants that received high levels of social undermining even after they return to their normal interactions the participant still returns to high level of undermining that affects the person mental health. These findings were found in relationships for men and women that were either unemployed or reemployed.\n\nAnother example of how social undermining can affect a person's relationship is shown by a study conducted by McCaskill and Lakey which examined social support and social undermining when it came to adolescents and family relationships. Social support and social undermining can reflect different characteristics in the environment that can influence a person's mental health. The study examined how adolescents reported their family support and undermining which reflected shared social reality (that is, all members of the family agree that support or undermining is occurring) and idiosyncratic perception (some family members believe that support or undermining has occurred, but others do not). The results of the study found that girls tend to report higher family stress and negative affect than boys. McCaskill and Lakey (2002) found that adolescents with previous outpatient treatment experience reported both lower family support and higher family stress.\n\nResearchers found that in adolescent self-reports, social undermining was related to negative affect and perceived support was more related to positive affect. The study found that adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions of family support did predict positive emotion, but shared perceptions of support did not. For social undermining, adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions, the idiosyncratic perceptions of the other family members as well as shared social reality that was among family members did predict negative emotion. The study suggest that social support is not based on a shared reality, while social undermining is.\n\nDue to the differences in the scope of the effects of social undermining and social support, many researchers have concluded that they are separate constructs, rather than two ends of a continuum.\n\nResearch has found that, depending on how the victim handles social undermining, it can have damaging effects when it comes to increased counterproductive behaviors, reciprocated social undermining, and decreased job satisfaction. These negative outcomes can cause the person to have depression, a decreased self-esteem and even psychosomatic symptoms.\n\nIn a study of victims' perceptions of undermining they had experienced, Crossley found that when an offense was severe, the victim was more likely to believe that the offender committed the action with malicious intent or due to personal greed. Generally, victims' perceptions of the offenders' intentions relate to whether the victim responds to the undermining in a negative fashion with feelings of anger and a desire for revenge, or in a positive fashion with a desire to reconcile with the offender.\n\nPost Traumatic Embitterment Disorder can be a reaction to this feeling of victimisation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100174", "title": "Somniloquy", "text": "Somniloquy\n\nSomniloquy or sleep-talking is a parasomnia that refers to talking aloud while asleep. It can be quite loud, ranging from simple mumbling sounds to loud shouts and long, frequently inarticulate speeches, and can occur many times during a sleep cycle. As with sleepwalking and night terrors, sleeptalking usually occurs during delta-wave NREM sleep stages or during temporary arousals therefrom.\n\nIt can also occur during the REM sleep stage, at which time it represents what sleep therapists call a \"motor breakthrough\" (see sleep paralysis) of dream speech: words spoken in a dream are spoken out loud. Depending on its frequency, this may or may not be considered pathological. All motor functions are typically disabled during REM sleep thus, motoric, i.e., verbal elaboration of dream content, could be considered an REM behavior disorder (see below).\n\nSleep-talking can occur by itself or as a feature of another sleep disorder such as:\n\nSleep-talking is very common and is reported in 50% of young children, with most of them outgrowing it by puberty, although in rare cases it may persist into adulthood (about 4% of adults are reported to talk in their sleep). It appears to run in families. In 1966, researchers worked to find links between heredity and somniloquy. Their research suggests the following:\n\n\nSleep-talking by itself is typically harmless; however, it can wake others and cause them consternation—especially when misinterpreted as conscious speech by an observer. If the sleep-talking is dramatic, emotional, or profane it may be a sign of another sleep disorder (see above). Sleep-talking can be monitored by a partner or by using an audio recording device; devices which remain idle until detecting a sound wave are ideal for this purpose. Polysomnography (sleep recording) shows episodes of sleep talking that can occur in any stage of sleep.\n\nSleep-talking appears in Shakespeare's Macbeth, the famous sleepwalking scene. Lady Macbeth, in a \"slumbery agitation,\" is observed by a gentlewoman and doctor to walk in her sleep and wash her hands, and utter the famous line, \"Out, damned spot! out, I say!\" (Act 5, Scene 1)\n\nSleep-talking also appears in \"The Childhood of King Erik Menved\", a 19th-century historical romance by Danish author Bernhard Severin Ingemann. In the story, a young girl named Aasé has the prophetic power of speaking the truth in her sleep. In an 1846 English translation, Aasé is described thus:\n\nShe is somewhat palefaced; and, however blithe and sprightly she may be, she is, nevertheless, now and then troubled with a kind of dreaming fit. But that will wear off as she gets older. Her mother was so troubled before her; and I believe it runs in the family as I am not entirely free from it myself. I do not give much heed to such dreaming now; but she has never yet said anything, while in this state, that has not proved in a manner true; though she can discern nothing, by night or day, more than others may do when they are in their senses.\n\nWalt Whitman wrote a now-lost novel based on Ingemann's romance, which he titled \"The Sleeptalker.\"\n\n\n"}

It was documented in a list of 75 words in Brown (1911). Keisuke Huziwara (2016) discovered an elderly rememberer of Taman in Htamanthi who could remember some Taman phrases as well as a short song, but was not fluent in the Taman language. However, no fluent speakers of Taman remained in the area.\n\nTaman speakers have since shifted to Burmese and Tai Naing (Red Shan), a Tai language spoken in northern Myanmar. Matisoff (2013:13) surmises that pressure from the formerly widespread Kadu language had caused Taman to become marginalized.

Taman also shares various similarities with many nearby non-Luish languages, including various Sal languages. Huziwara (2016) concludes that Taman is part of a linkage of Tibeto-Burman languages spanning across northeast India and northern Myanmar (i.e., comparable to Scott DeLancey's Central Tibeto-Burman languages), but does not recognizably fit into any known Tibeto-Burman branch.\n\nTaman has the following phonemes.\n\nBelow are five innovations from Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB) to Taman identified by Huziwara (2016).\n\nBelow is Brown's (1911) Taman word list as cited and re-transcribed in Huziwara (2016:19-29), and Brown's (1911) Taman list re-transcribed by Luce (1985), as cited and re-transcribed in Huziwara (2016).\n\nThe Taman word for 'river' is the same as the word for 'water'.\n\nOn March 2, 2015, Keisuke Huziwara discovered an 83-year-old woman in Htamanthi who remembered some words and phrases of the Taman language, as well as a short song.

{"id": "19851994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19851994", "title": "Trade (sports)", "text": "Trade (sports)\n\nIn North American professional sports, a trade is a sports league transaction between sports clubs that involves an exchange of players from one club/team to another. Though players are the primary trading assets, draft picks and/or cash are other assets that may be supplemented to consummate a trade, either packaged alongside players' contracts to be transferred to another team, or as standalone assets in exchange for players' contracts and/or draft picks in return. In Major League Baseball, a player to be named later can be used to finalize the terms of a trade at a later date, but draft picks are not admissible as trading assets (with one exception). In Major League Soccer, besides current MLS players and draft picks, clubs may also trade MLS rights to non-MLS players, allocation money, allocation rankings, and international player slots. Typically, trades are completed between two clubs, but there are instances where trades are consummated among three or more clubs.\n\nConversely, a sports transaction involving a player who becomes a free agent and joins another club/team does not qualify as a trade as the player was not contractually bound to the previous team at the time of acquisition.\n\nA no-trade clause is an amendment to a contract, usually relevant in American professional sports, wherein a player may not be traded to another club without the player's consent. Sometimes this clause is implemented by the club itself, but the vast majority are requested by the athlete and his sports agent. In many cases, these no-trade clauses are limited, where a club may be limited to trading the athlete only at certain times, or only to a certain team or geographical area.\n\nNo-trade clauses are found in most sports in North America, including Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, and some minor leagues around the country. Many European leagues, mostly professional soccer and basketball, also implement these contract amendments.\n\nEach league usually has its own rules regarding these clauses; for example in the NBA, no-trade clauses can only be negotiated into contracts when a player has at least four years of service for the team he is signing the contract with and at least eight years total in the NBA. Other leagues have other varying rules, for example in MLB the \"Ten and Five\" rule gives mostly every player limited control on his tradability once he meets the ten and five criteria, which means the player has played in the league ten seasons and with the current team for at least five. In the NHL, these rights have been blamed for the lack of trades that have been pulled off in recent years, with critics citing examples where \"done deals\" were blown up by \"selfish players.\"\n\nOften the no-trade clause is waived by the players themselves, usually in order to play for a contending team.\n\nIn one dramatic case in 2001, Tampa Bay Devil Rays first baseman Fred McGriff mulled over waiving his rights for nearly a month before ultimately accepting a deal which sent him to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIn 2017, Miami Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton rejected trades both to the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants, saying that he would refuse to waive his no-trade clause for any teams other than the contenders Chicago Cubs, hometown Los Angeles Dodgers, up-and-coming New York Yankees, and reigning 2017 World Series champion Houston Astros. Stanton was eventually traded to the Yankees for Starlin Castro, Jorge Guzman, and José Devers.\n\nIn 2007, Kobe Bryant was willing to waive his no trade clause with the Los Angeles Lakers in order to be dealt to either the Phoenix Suns or the Chicago Bulls, but in this case, Kobe Bryant's own pickiness as far as where he would like to play limited the Lakers' ability to move him, and eventually no trade was made at all.\n\nDarryl Sittler's no-trade clause protected him from being moved, when Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard and manager Punch Imlach wanted to get rid of or reduce Sittler's influence on the team; a few years later Sittler waived the clause when relations between him and Ballard deteriorated. Dany Heatley demanded a trade from the Ottawa Senators at the end of the 2008–09 season; a deal was in place to send Heatley to the Edmonton Oilers on June 30, but Heatley refused to waive his no-trade clause (the Oilers had missed the playoffs for 3 straight seasons), so he was traded to the San Jose Sharks instead. Rick Nash demanded a trade from the Columbus Blue Jackets during the 2011–12 NHL season, but the deal could not be completed due to general manager Scott Howson's high asking price from the teams to whom Nash would have permitted a trade. The holdout lasted into the summer of 2012, when he was traded to the New York Rangers for Brandon Dubinsky, Tim Erixon, Artem Anisimov, and the Rangers first round pick in the 2013 draft.\n\nIn an unusual case, Mats Sundin refused to waive his no-trade clause during the latter part of the 2007–08 season, even though his Maple Leafs were on track to miss the playoffs, and his contract was set to expire after the season concluded. Leafs management requested that Sundin waive his no-trade clause in order for the team to rebuild by acquiring potential young talent and/or draft picks, and Sundin was coveted by several teams looking to bolster their roster for the playoffs before the trade deadline. Sundin said he did not believe in being a \"rental player\" and that if he won the Stanley Cup, he wanted to do it over the course of a whole season.\n\nA trade deadline (or trading deadline) is a rule regulating the trading of professional players' contracts between clubs. In Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League, players acquired through trade after the trade deadline are ineligible for postseason play in that season, unless the respective league allows them to replace an injured player on the roster. In the National Football League, National Basketball Association and Major League Soccer, post-deadline trades are not allowed. This term is used mainly in North America. In the approach to the deadline, there is heightened activity and interest in trades.\n\nThe purpose of a trade deadline is to keep competitive balance towards the end of the season.\n\nThe Major League Baseball (MLB) non-waiver deadline was first instituted for the 1923 season, on June 23 of that year. It was moved to July 31 starting with the 1986 season. Commissioner Rob Manfred moved it to August 1 for the 2016 season only, as July 31, 2016 is a Sunday. After the All-Star break, teams will determine whether or not they are in position to contend for the post-season. Because of free agency and the lack of a salary cap in baseball, players in the final year of their contract are often put on the \"trading block\" by many of the non-playoff contending teams. Smaller market teams will not — or cannot afford to — pay their better veteran players high salaries, so they will attempt to trade them to a post-season contender, in exchange for some minor-league prospects or other players who might be able to help them in the future.\n\nThe MLB waiver deadline is August 31. There is much less activity between August 1 and August 31 because players must clear waivers. The waivers are revocable meaning that a team can revoke the claim of another team on their player. Players may be acquired after the August 31 deadline; however, while they can contribute to a team's push for the playoffs, they are ineligible for postseason play.\n\nThe trade deadline was instituted by MLB in response to various attempts by two New York City-based ballclubs, the Giants and Yankees, to use their financial advantages to tilt their respective leagues' competitive balance in their favor from 1917 through 1922. In the Yankees' case, most of its dealings were with the Boston Red Sox. The American League (AL) established MLB's first-ever such rule in 1920 as an indirect result of the Red Sox's sale of Babe Ruth to the Yankees. It prohibited the trading and selling of ballplayers between August 1 and the conclusion of the World Series. A uniform rule serving both major leagues, which was adopted prior to the 1923 season, set the deadline at June 15. The date, chosen by MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis based on a suggestion from Pittsburgh Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss, remained in effect through the 1985 season. The rule originated with the 1986 Basic Agreement which resulted from the resolution of the 1985 MLB strike.\n\nThe National Basketball Association's deadline falls on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in mid-February) at 3pm Eastern Time. The deadline for the 2011-12 season was on March 15, 2012 due to the 2011-12 NBA lockout. In the NBA, post-deadline trades are forbidden, although teams are allowed to sign free agents and call up players from the G-League until the end of the regular season.\n\nThe National Football League's deadline is the Tuesday following the eighth week (formerly sixth) of the regular season.\n\nUsually, there is fairly little activity on this day and almost no star players are ever dealt to other clubs on the sixth week of the season. The early deadline, along with players having to learn a whole new system on the fly, along with the salary cap often makes it difficult to make blockbuster trades on this day, unlike most other sports. Post deadline trades are not allowed.\n\nThe National Hockey League's trade deadline is calculated as the 40th day before the final day of the Regular Season, ensuring that it typically falls during the last week of February or the first week of March. Much like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, the NHL's trade deadline is often a period of increased player movement; teams that are either making a final push to secure a playoff spot or hoping to go deep into the playoffs attempt to trade to acquire key veterans or proven scorers in order to solidify their rosters. Conversely, teams that are rebuilding with younger players may be willing to trade away their more expensive players in order to \"dump\" (reduce) salary and get draft picks/prospects in return. Players on playoff-contending teams who are injured and not expected to return for the current season may be offered to teams that are rebuilding, since they will be of no value to a team's playoff prospects in the current season but may be of value to another team for (a) future season(s). Also, players who are about to become unrestricted free agents and have indicated that they do not intend to return to their current teams may be traded away so that those teams will get something in return, instead of seeing such players sign with another team while their former teams receive nothing.\n\nThe NHL trade deadline also generates a great deal of talk among hockey fans and analysts, with much speculation and discussion about which players will get traded and where they will go. In Canada, the NHL trade deadline is treated with such significance that the two major sports networks TSN and Sportsnet devote much of the day to speculation and coverage of trades.\n\nAssociation football clubs have two transfer windows per season. In most countries, one falls during the middle of the season and the other runs during the period between seasons, generally called the \"close season\" in Europe and \"off-season\" in North America. For those countries with seasons starting in August/September such as most European countries, the midseason transfer window usually falls in January, and the other one opens from June to September. In countries with seasons that operate entirely within a calendar year, like many leagues in Latin America or Northern Europe, as well as North America's Major League Soccer, the midseason transfer window opens in July/August, while the other starts from March to April. The difference between a transfer window and a trade deadline is that players cannot be bought or sold outside these transfer window periods. The notion of transfer windows was initially introduced in Europe, and subsequently adopted by FIFA. Like North America's trade deadline, there is greatly increased activity and interest as the close of a transfer window draws near.\n\nIn Major League Soccer, trades between MLS teams that involve players and player transfers from outside MLS must occur during either the primary transfer window (typically February - May) or secondary transfer window (July - August).\n\nMLS roster freeze date falls on September 15, at which time teams must submit their final roster that cannot be changed through the day after MLS Cup.\n\n"}
{"id": "34035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34035", "title": "Web design", "text": "Web design\n\nWeb design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.\n\nAlthough web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. However, web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people’s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, and music.\n\nIn 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould. The W3C was created in October 1994 to \"lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability.\" This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.\n\nIn 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique. The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing. CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see tableless web design.\n\nIn 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.\n\nDuring 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open source licence, enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform. The Web Standards Project was formed and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards by creating Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the PNG image format. During this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.\n\nSince the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.\n\nSince the end of the browsers wars new browsers have been released. Many of these are open source meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The new options are considered by many to be better than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.\n\nThe W3C has released new standards for HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3), as well as new JavaScript API's, each as a new but individual standard. While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and \"some\" of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).\n\nWeb designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or generated by WYSIWYG editing software. Other tools web designers might use include mark up validators and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.\n\nMarketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B) business-to-business website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web navigation, especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.\n\nUser understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works. This is part of the user experience design. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the interactive design of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less user-friendly website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill. Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the user interface design.\n\nAdvanced interactive functions may require plug-ins if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.\n\nPart of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the page layout. For example, a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout. Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of aesthetics on larger screens.\n\nFluid layouts increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and grid-based design in both page layout design principle and in coding technique, but were very slow to be adopted. This was due to considerations of screen reading devices and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, embedded advertising areas, navigation areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of the reader's screen (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the browser can make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts, but not fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below body text rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.\n\nResponsive Web Design is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS codice_1 rule. In March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.Sites using responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.\n\nWeb designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.\n\nFont downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in web typography, as well as the usage of font downloading.\n\nMost site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.\n\nThe page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content. In either case, motion graphic design may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.\n\nMotion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable the animations.\n\nWebsite designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called tag soup. Validating via W3C can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information can then be corrected by the user.\n\nThere are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.\n\nA static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as Jekyll and Adobe Muse.\n\nThe benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware. These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and virtual servers offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.\n\nAlmost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and stylesheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.\n\nDynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use a document database such as MongoDB or NoSQL to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.\n\nIn the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or wireframed using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.\n\nWhen dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as Perl, PHP or ASP. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page and data was inserted into places defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.\n\nBoth of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as content management systems. These build on top of general purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well recognised models, such as a time-sequenced blog, a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organisational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.\n\nEditing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself, and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is Wikipedia.\n\nUsability experts, including Jakob Nielsen and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a website. However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds. Leading many practitioners to argue that homepages are less important than most people think. Jared Spool argued in 2007 that a site's homepage was actually the least important page on a website.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called 'sliders' and 'rotating banners') have become an extremely popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined space. Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a website's search engine optimisation and usability.\n\nThere are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another. Particularly in smaller organizations one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.\nFurther jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include: \n\n"}

When he failed an exam and lost his scholarship at the end of July 2011, he traveled to Salento, Nardò in Southern Italy. He started working at Masseria Boncuri, a local farm, as a tomato picker. There, Sagnet organized a protest against the inhumane working conditions on the farm that successfully lead to reforms to the regulations for working conditions in the agricultural industry. \n\nAfter the uprising, Sagnet continued his activism through working as an advocate for CGIL and finished his degree in engineering. \n\nIn 2015, Sagnet published a book about the exploitation of workers in the Italian agricultural industry with Fandango Libri. His second book, about his own experience at Masseria Boncuri, followed with Galleria Fandango in 2017.\n\nIn February 2017, Sagnet was knighted Cavaliere dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana by Italian president Sergio Mattarella for his work to end modern-day slavery in the Italian agricultural industry.\n\nWhile working at the Massaria Boncuri, Sagnet discovered the caporalato, a system revolving around the caporali, who illegally recruit tomato workers in a gang-like manner that Sagnet describes as comparable to \"modern-day slavery\" in the Italian agricultural industry. The workers worked 16-hour days for wages of 20-25 euros, with the caporali taking a huge cut of the profits. Sagnet describes situations in which the caporali charged workers several days worth of wages for driving them to the hospital when they passed out due to exhaustion. \n\nOn the morning 30th July 2011, after only working on the fields for five days, Sagnet persuaded his fellow workers to start a strike after their employers issued an increase in workload without an increase in pay. The workers protested for two weeks, erecting a street block. The protest encompassed 350 workers from Masseria Boncuri. When faced with the issue of not being paid and starvation during their strike, he reached out to the general public for help with food donations, and the strike eventually led to local farmers agreeing to formal contracts for their workers and politicians approving an anti-gang master law, forbidding the caporali from undercutting wages by law one week after the strike had ended, in September 2011.\n\nIn the same year, the Anti-Mafia District Attorney Office of Lecce started an investigation of the matter of the caporalato, requesting 22 arrests. 16 caporali were ultimately arrested. Sagnet was a key witness in the trial of kingpin Saber Ben Mahmoud Jelassi.\n\nSagnet is the founder of the No Cap Association, a reward system working with report cards, evaluating how ethically goods have been produced through the parameters ethics, energy, circularity, added value and short supply chain. The organization advocates for the ethical employment of tomato pickers through regulated contracts and without a caporalato, promoting the integration of ethically produced goods into the mainstream consumer market.\n\n"}
