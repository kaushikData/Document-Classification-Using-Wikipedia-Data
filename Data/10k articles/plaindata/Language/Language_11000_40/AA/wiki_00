{"id": "393589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393589", "title": "Aerogram", "text": "Aerogram\n\nAn aerogram, aérogramme, air letter or airletter is a thin lightweight piece of foldable and gummed paper for writing a letter for transit via airmail, in which the letter and envelope are one and the same. Most postal administrations forbid enclosures in these light letters, which are usually sent abroad at a preferential rate. Printed warnings existed to say that an enclosure would cause the mail to go at the higher letter rate.\n\nThe use of the term \"aerogramme\" was officially endorsed at the 1952 Universal Postal Union Postal Union Congress in Brussels. Thereafter, the term \"air letter\" quickly faded from use.\n\nMost aerograms have an imprinted stamp indicating the prepayment of postage. As such, this meets the definition of being postal stationery. However, some countries such as New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Ireland, sell unstamped aerograms. Unstamped aerograms are referred to as \"formular\" aerograms and can be issued by either postal authorities or by private companies. Senders are required to write their name and address on the reverse.\n\nThe aerogram was largely popularized by its use during the Second World War (1939–45). Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Evans, Royal Engineers, Assistant Director Army Postal Service Middle East Force (MEF), proposed that a lightweight self-sealing letter card that weighed only 1/10 oz be adopted by the British Army for air mail purposes. He recommended its use to Sir Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War during his visit to the Middle East, in late 1940. By January the following year, General Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief, MEF was told by Eden that \"Your Assistant Director Army Postal Services may forthwith introduce an Air Mail Letter Card Service for the Middle East. Use British stamps from all countries, including Egypt.\".\n\nEvans first saw the air letter form in Iraq, whilst touring the Commands after his arrival in the Middle East theatre. It had been introduced into the Iraqi postal service in 1933 by the then Inspector General of Posts and Telegraphs, Major DW Grumbley CBE DSO Royal Engineers. The original form, on thin paper was 124mm x 99mm in size, greyish in colour, with bluelined framing and with the designation legend on the front. It had a beautifully impressed effigy of Faisal I of Iraq and was printed by Bradbury Wilkinson.\n\nOn 1 March 1941, the air mail service between the Middle East and the UK was started, using a combination of British Overseas Airways flying boats and military transport. The private nature of the air letter ensured its popularity among its users and that popularity, with its lightness, brought about its continued use as today's civilian air letter (aerograms) and the British military \"bluey\". (see British Forces Post Office for further information).\n\nOn April 29, 1947, the US entered the scene with a 10 cent \"Air Letter\" Sheet. The same imprinted stamp with the propeller plane was used until updated with a jet airliner image in 1958. The US issued a total of 25 aerograms through 1999. The production of United States aerograms has ceased. Linn's Stamp News in late 2006 reported that the United States Postal Service had announced as the supply of aerograms on hand at post offices were exhausted the stock would not be replenished. It quotes David Failor, Postal Service executive director of stamp services as explaining, \"Demand for these has been next to nothing for the past five years.\"\n\nWith the decline in postal communication, Aerograms have been withdrawn from various postal services. Royal Mail in the United Kingdom disbanded the aerogram in April, 2012. Aerograms (aerogramme) are still available from Australia's Australia Post.\n\nHistorically, as the aerogram was the least expensive form of international postal communication, users often went to extreme lengths to make best use of the space available including writing in different colours, in different directions, and printing on the sheets minimising font size and margins.\n\n\n\n"}

Her novellas are considered to be prominent pieces of Finnish literature. Kallas is also known for her love affair with the legendary poet Eino Leino. \n\nKallas was the daughter of Julius Krohn, a nationally known Finnish scientist and fennoman, and the sister of the folklorist Kaarle Krohn and the writer Helmi Krohn. Her father was also one of the first people to publish poetry written in the Finnish language. In 1900, Kallas married Oskar Kallas, an Estonian scholar, doctor of folklore and later diplomat. The couple lived in Saint Petersburg and had five children. In 1904, they moved to Tartu, Estonia. Kallas became interested in the history and culture of her new homeland and she joined Noor-Eesti, a sociocultural society which campaigned for the independence of Estonia. Although she continued writing in Finnish, she often wrote about Estonian subjects. She lived in London from 1922 to 1934, while her husband was Estonia's ambassador to the United Kingdom.\nShe published her diaries for the period 1897-1931 in the 1950s.\n\nA recurring theme in Kallas's novellas is what she termed \"the slaying Eros\", a love that often leads to death, especially prominent in her trilogy of \"Barbara von Tisenhusen\" (1923), \"Reigin Pappi\" (The Pastor of Reigi, 1926), and \"Sudenmorsian\" (The Wolf's Bride, 1928). \"The Pastor of Reigi\" and \"Barbara von Tisenhusen\" were soon translated into English and published in 1927 as \"Eros the Slayer\". The language of her most famous story, \"Sudenmorsian\", a werewolf story set in 17th century Hiiumaa, is rich with archaic, Romantic, colorful prose, something of a Kallas trademark. These three stories have more recently been published in one English-language volume as \"Three Novels\" (1975). A collection of her short stories was published in English under the title \"The White Ship\", with a foreword by John Galsworthy in 1924.\n\n"}

A condition might be asymptomatic if it fails to show the noticeable symptoms with which it is usually associated. Asymptomatic infections are also called subclinical infections. Other diseases (such as mental illnesses) might be considered subclinical if they present some but not all of the symptoms required for a clinical diagnosis. The term clinically silent is also used.\n\nKnowing that a condition is asymptomatic is important because:\n\nAn example of an asymptomatic disease is Cytomegalovirus (CMV) which is a member of the herpes virus. \"It is estimated that 1% of all newborns are infected with CMV, but the majority of infections are asymptomatic.\" (Knox, 1983; Kumar et al. 1984) In some diseases, the proportion of asymptomatic cases can be important. For example, in multiple sclerosis it is estimated that around 25% of the cases are asymptomatic, being these cases detected postmortem or just by coincidence (as incidental findings) while treating other diseases.\n\nAsymptomatic conditions may not be discovered until the patient undergoes medical tests (X-rays or other investigations). Some people may remain asymptomatic for a remarkably long period of time; such as people with some forms of cancer. If a patient is asymptomatic, precautionary steps must be taken.\n\nA patient's individual genetic makeup may delay or prevent the onset of symptoms.\n\nSome diseases are defined only clinically, like AIDS being opposed to HIV infection. Therefore, it makes no sense to speak about \"asymptomatic AIDS\". This concept of clinically defined diseases is related in some way to the concept of syndrome.\n\nThese are conditions for which there is a sufficient number of documented individuals that are asymptomatic that it is clinically noted.

In 1991 it was spoken by approximately 45,000 Buru people who live on the Indonesian island of Buru (). It is also preserved in the Buru communities on Ambon and some other Maluku Islands, as well as in the Indonesian capital Jakarta and in the Netherlands.\n\nThe most detailed study of Buru language was conducted in the 1980s by Australian missionaries and ethnographers Charles E. Grimes and Barbara Dix Grimes.\n\nThree dialects of Buru can be distinguished, each of which is used by its corresponding ethnic group on Buru island: Rana (named after the lake in the center of Buru; more than 14,000 speakers), Masarete (more than 9,500 speakers) and Wae Sama (more than 6,500 speakers). Some 3,000–5,000 of Rana people along with their main dialect use the so-called \"secret dialect\" Ligahan. The dialect of Fogi which once existed in the western area of the island is now extinct. Lexical differences between the dialects are about 90% between Masarete and Wae Sama, 88% between Masarete and Rana and 80% between Wae Sama and Rana. Aside from native vernaculars, most Buru people, especially in the coastal regions and towns, have at least some command and understanding of the official language of the country, Indonesian. The coastal population also uses the \"Melayu Ambon\", also known as Ambonese Malay\n\nBuru people use traditional names, along with Muslim or Christian names, the most common being Lesnussa, Latbual, Nurlatu, Lehalima, Wael and Sigmarlatu. The language has several sets of taboo words, which are both behavioral and linguistic. For example, relatives refer to each other by kin names, but not by proper names (i.e., father, but not Lesnussa). However, contrary to many other Austronesian cultures, Buru people do refer to the deceased relatives by name. Other restrictions apply to the objects of nature, harvest, hunting and fishing, for which certain words should be chosen depending on the island area. These taboos have explanations in associated myths of legends. In all cases, the words for taboo items are not omitted, but substituted by alternatives. All Buru dialects have loanwords. Many of them originated from Dutch and Portuguese during the Dutch colonization and referred to the objects not previously seen on the island. Other types of borrowed words came from Malayan languages as a result of inflow of people from the nearby island.\n\nThe Buru language has 5 vowels and 17 consonants. They are illustrated on the tables below:\n\nContrary to other indigenous languages of Buru and the nearby island of Ambelau (Lisela, Kayeli and Ambelau), Buru has a functional writing system based on the Latin alphabet. Buru Christians worship with a Bible written in their native language, the first translations of which were made back in 1904 by Dutch missionaries.\n\nThe Buru language can be classified as an SVO language, prepositional, with modifiers following the head noun in a noun phrase, and the genitive occurring before the noun.\n\nFree pronouns may be used equally for the subject and object of intransitive verbs (marking either actor or undergoer).\nExamples:\n\nExamples:\n\nDepending on its distribution a possessive word can behave verbally or nominally, or as the head of a predicative possessive construction or as the modifier of the possessive NP. \nThe possessive word is the only word in the Buru language obligatorily inflected for person and number and behaves much like a verb in its affixing possibilities. All examples in this section have been taken from Grimes, 1991 chapter 14.\n\nThe basic structure of the constituent is SVO.\n\nFunctional and distributional behaviour of the possessive construction:\n\nApplicative /-k/ is used to indicate a definite pronominal object (an object that functions as a pronoun). \n\nThe possessive word can also accept valence changing verbal prefixes however this is restricted to the third singular form 'nake'.\n\nPeople can be put at someone’s disposal through the combination of /ep-em-/. \n\nThe possessive word, with or without a proceeding cliticised free pronoun, functions as a possessive pronoun with a NP.\n\nUsed with verbs of exchange, the possessive word can have the force of a dative argument. \n"}

The team consists of Paul Murphy (Founder & CEO), Angela Clarke (Founder & VP Product).\n\nThe company was started because the Calltrunk founders personally needed a cloud-based call recording service. With backgrounds in telephony and software, they built a company, Calltrunk, to fill the need. Richard Newton, Calltrunk's marketing director, says: \"Companies record us, so why shouldn't we record them? If there's a dispute, they hold all the cards. We wanted to put power back into the hands of the consumer\".\n\nCalltrunk has global investment banks among its clients and recently secured nearly £2m in investment funding to outsource the ARGOsearch programme to large corporates.\n\nCalltrunk launched a conversation search engine application called ARGOsearch. The software, available for computers and mobile devices, enables users to record phone calls and search them for verbal information.\n\nSubscribers store spoken data from mobiles, land lines, Skype or a dictaphone, and upload them into an online storage bank. They can then search the recorded conversations for dates, times, words or phrases.\n\nThe technology can struggle to cope with background noise and some regional accents, resulting in accuracy rates too low to make services acceptable to a mass audience. Calltrunk's word indexation accuracy is around 80%.\n\nARGOsearch enables individuals and small companies to capture, store and search conversations in the way that large companies already can.\n\nWhile the regular Calltrunk service charges a monthly fee, ArgoSearch is currently free, though a Calltrunk spokesman said the company would eventually charge for it. It works in Web browsers and on the iPhone, and Android phones.\n\nARGOsearch is available in beta in the US, UK and Australia. Users can sign up via the Calltrunk website or through its mobile apps.\n\nCalltrunk’s products allows you to share and/or make your recordings with Evernote, Box, Dropbox, Sugar CRM, download or order transcriptions.\n\nAll CallTrunk recordings can be accessed online via a browser or via Call Trunk’s iPhone app. The recordings can also be shared on social networks or sent to Evernote, box or SugarCRM.\n\nCalltrunk maintains that when recording conversations for private purposes - as long as that recording is not shared with a third party - only one person needs to be aware of, and consent to, the recording.\n\nAnthony Lee, data protection and privacy expert at law firm Bircham Dyson Bell, agrees, but only up to a point. \"This does not apply if you want to use a third party, such as a cloud service-provider, to store recordings, particularly if sensitive personal data is involved, or if the recording is to be stored on servers which are located outside of the European Economic Area,\" he says. \"The informed consent and, sometimes, the explicit consent of the individual or individuals concerned, will typically be required. It will be interesting to see the practice which emerges here.\"\n\nCalltrunk disagrees and believes the law is analogous to that covering email, which, technically speaking, requires the consent of the sender before you can forward it. Practically no-one does this.\n\nAbout recording people secretly, the system provides automatic beeping to signal recording is in progress. There is also an automatic announcement that a user can switch off if they prefer to tell the counter party themselves. These are customisable which reflects that requirements change from country to country and state to state.\n\nCalltrunk co-founder Angela Clarke said federal law only requires single-party consent for recorded calls, though some states require all-party consent. Representatives from Calltrunk and Uppidy said they leave it up to users to notify people if they are being recorded.\n\nCalltrunk was acquired by Bettervoice in May 2015. BetterVoice integrates with your address book just as Calltrunk did. Their outbound calling system uses your phone's outbound line, which is a more natural experience than Calltrunk's dial-back according to the letter sent to all CallTrunk users prior to the acquisition. On 8th May 2015 Calltrunk was completely shut down.\n\n"}

{"id": "36346602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36346602", "title": "Carriage dispute", "text": "Carriage dispute\n\nA carriage dispute is a disagreement over the right to \"carry\", that is, retransmit, a broadcaster's signal. Carriage disputes first occurred between broadcasters and cable companies and now include direct broadcast satellite and other multichannel video programming distributors.\n\nThese disputes often involve financial compensation – what the distributor pays the television station or network for the right to carry the signal – as well as what channels the distributor is permitted or required to retransmit and how the distributor offers those channels to its subscribers. While most carriage disputes are resolved without controversy or notice, others have involved programming blackouts, both threatened and real, as well as strident public relations campaigns. Carriage disputes have occurred both in the United States and internationally.\n\nThe history of carriage disputes can be seen as having two distinct circumstances: the first involving over-the-air broadcasters, whose signals can be received with an antenna; the second involving broadcasters transmitting via cable, satellite or other means—but not over the air. In the United States, the first led to a quagmire of legal disputes involving the Federal Communications Commission and the courts, shifting regulations, and questions over copyright law – all revolving around the basic question of whether a carrier has an inherent right to retransmit an over-the-air signal. Broadcasters accused carriers of being \"leeches\", making money off of programming content that they contributed nothing to produce. Carriers countered that their role was largely passive, because they were merely redistributing freely available signals more widely. By contrast, carriage disputes involving broadcasters who do not use the public airwaves, while representing many high-profile encounters, have raised fewer legal and policy questions, playing out largely at the negotiation table and in the court of public opinion.\n\nThe legal precedent for carriage disputes dates back to 1934 legislation, which required a broadcaster to get permission before using programming from another broadcaster. The law was later applied to cable companies, as well. In the 1950s, cable companies operating in the western United States began retransmitting broadcast signals for the benefit of customers situated too far from the station's transmitter to receive programs with an antenna. Stations objected that they were not being compensated for this retransmission or that they were having to compete with more distant stations that duplicated their content. From February 15, 1966 to December 18, 1968, the United States Federal Communications Commission barred cable companies from importing non-local broadcast signals into the top 100 television markets – while allowing cable companies to petition for exceptions. After an interim period, the FCC partially lifted these restrictions in 1972, eliminating them entirely by the end of the decade.\n\nThe issue was finally resolved with the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act. Among its provisions, the act mandated that distributors must carry local stations who make their signal available for free, but must also get retransmission consent before a signal can be retransmitted. Mandatory retransmission consent gave broadcasters the ability to seek compensation from distributors and established the basis for carriage disputes going forward. At first, the larger broadcasters negotiated not for higher fees, but for inclusion of their newer, lesser known, non-terrestrial channels. Fox, for example, obtained distribution for FX; NBC for CNBC. The practice complicated carriage disputes by making bundled tiers not just a marketing choice, but a contractual obligation.\n\nCarriage disputes have since increased both in intensity and frequency. According to the American Television Alliance, a television viewer advocacy group, there were eight blackouts of various lengths in 2010, 94 in 2014, 123 in 2015, and 212 in late 2017.\n\nThe 2009 dispute between Time Warner Cable and Fox is an example of a carriage dispute involving an over-the-air broadcaster. The dispute pitted the second largest United States cable system against one of the four major U.S. television networks, whose broadcasts included the popular prime time series \"American Idol\" and National Football League games. Fox's then-parent company, News Corporation (which has since spun off the network and its cable channels to 21st Century Fox), reportedly sought a monthly fee of $1 per subscriber; Time Warner offered 20 to 25 cents. Both companies mounted aggressive public relations campaigns, including dedicated websites and advertising. Fox suggested that viewers look into alternatives to Time Warner, including satellite and Verizon's Fios service. Time Warner Cable countered that it was trying to reign in expenses that would ultimately be paid by subscribers. The companies ultimately settled close to the deadline, and, as is typical with carriage disputes, did not disclose the terms. The deal encouraged other over-the-air broadcasters to seek higher retransmission payments, thereby putting upward pressure on cable and satellite bills.\n\nThe 2012 dispute between DirecTV and Viacom is an example of a dispute involving a non-terrestrial broadcaster. Viacom's cable/satellite channels, including Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV, were blacked out for some 20 million DirecTV subscribers, who together represented about 20 percent of all U.S. households who subscribed to cable or satellite. DirecTV claimed Viacom was seeking a 30 percent fee hike, about $1 billion over five years. Viacom countered that while its channels represented 20 percent of total DirecTV viewing, the broadcaster received only 5 percent of the distributor's license fees. DirecTV argued that Viacom made too much of its content available for free on the Internet. Viacom responded that the practice was a marketing tool, although it pared that content back after the blackout. Also mentioned as a point of contention was Viacom's bundling of its co-owned channels – making them available to distributors only as a package rather than individually. In a sign of the increasing pressure on carriers to limit subscriber fees, DirecTV competitors did not mount advertising campaigns to attract disgruntled customers, and some competitors issued statements of support. Viacom and DirecTV resolved the dispute with a seven-year contract nine days later. Financial terms were not disclosed, though one analyst estimated Viacom would receive around $2.85 per subscriber, up from $2.25. In a first for Viacom, the company also agreed to give DirecTV customers access to live feeds on mobile devices.\n\nOccasionally, a carriage dispute can last for months or even years. In September 2012, Time Warner Cable and the National Football League ended a nine-year dispute primarily over NFL Network, and later, NFL RedZone Channel. The deal followed an earlier settlement between the NFL and Cablevision, making Time Warner the last major holdout. Time Warner had offered to carry NFL Network on a narrower sports tier and argued that the relative scarcity of annual games–eight, expanded to 13–did not justify the cost. SNL Kagan estimated the average subscriber fee at 95 cents per month. Some prolonged disputes are influenced by outside people and organizations. In 2003, New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg helped arrange a deal between Cablevision and YES Network, which had kept many New York Yankees baseball games from being seen by some 3 million local subscribers for the first year of YES Network's run. In 2006, EchoStar dropped the female-oriented channel Lifetime for a competing channel, Oxygen. While Lifetime is partially owned by Disney, which in turn owns ESPN and ABC, the deciding factor for contract renewal came less from the parent company's clout than from a letter writing campaign spurred by the National Organization for Women, the YWCA, and other groups.\n\nBlackouts have occasionally extended to broadcasters' websites. In the summer of 2013, CBS blocked access to all Time Warner Cable subscribers, whether or not they lived in the disputed regions. In 2014, Viacom blocked streaming video access to Cable One customers. Broadcasters argued that the practice closes a loophole: if distributors are to feel pressure from their subscribers, those subscribers shouldn't be able to view the content elsewhere. The Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said the practice of extending blackouts to the Internet is of broad concern.\n\nA February 2015 carriage dispute between Fox Sports 1 and AT&T U-verse produced a rare example of a partial blackout. When the parties couldn't agree, the channel did not disappear entirely from the U-verse lineup. Instead, the blackout only extended to some programing, including NASCAR events, Major League Soccer matches, and USGA golf events. FS1 had added most of these events after its launch and maintained it was only seeking to get paid for the added value provided. AT&T U-verse called the additional fees \"unreasonable\".\n\nIn 2012, a carriage dispute of a different sort arose between Aereo, a small New York-based program distributor, and several major broadcasters, including CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, Univision and PBS. Aereo used banks of small antennas to receive over-the-air signals from broadcasters, then made those signals available to subscribers via the Internet. But unlike other distributors, the company argued that, as an \"antenna technology\" company, it was exempt from paying retransmission consent fees, just as is any home viewer employing an antenna. Broadcasters countered that the Aereo service went beyond the conventional antenna because it both recorded programs for later viewing and charged subscribers a monthly fee, thus acting as a middleman. Aereo won its case in all but one lower court proceeding, including an April 1, 2013 ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. But in a 6-3 decision issued on June 25, 2014, the Supreme Court sided with the broadcasters, ruling that Aereo had violated copyright laws.\n\nSome legislators have sought to dampen the effects of carriage disputes on subscribers by giving more power to the Federal Communications Commission. In 2010, then Senator John Kerry introduced draft legislation that would have given the FCC more oversight responsibility, with the power to monitor negotiations and impose binding arbitration if it deems discussions between broadcasters and distributors are not being carried out in good faith. In 2013, Representatives Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren introduced the Video CHOICE (Consumers Have Options in Choosing Entertainment) Act, which would have enabled the FCC to prohibit channel blackouts during a dispute. The bill would also have prohibited broadcast channels from negotiating for carriage of its non-broadcast channels.\n\nOn the same day the Video CHOICE legislation was introduced, Representative Steve Scalise reintroduced legislation first drafted in 2011: the Next Generation Television Marketplace Act. The legislation, more far-reaching than CHOICE, would have repealed key provisions of the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, including \"must carry\" and retransmission consent requirements, as well as compulsory copyright licenses stemming from 1976 copyright law. The legislative intent was that carriage negotiations for broadcast stations should play out on the same terms as those for non-terrestrial channels. Both bills, while given only narrow chances of passage, were generally welcomed by distributors and criticized by broadcasters.\n\nAs with all negotiations, carriage disputes involve tradeoffs for both parties. Distributors must weigh the effect of the carriage fees they pay on both their revenues and the fees they pass on to subscribers. Distributors also risk antagonizing their subscribers if they drop one or more channels from their lineup. For their part, broadcasters risk losing viewers, which in turn can reduce revenues from commercials and per-subscriber carriage fees. Financial consequences can ensue. Dish Network lost 156,000 customers in the fourth quarter of 2011 after a carriage dispute with Fox resulted in a loss of Fox Sports programming in October. AMC Networks' stock dropped by nearly five percent after the network's programming was dropped by Dish at the end of June 2012.\n\nFor distributors, much of the calculation hinges on whether programming content is so compelling that it is worth the retransmission fee. Sports programming provides a good example of how the calculation may favor either party.\n\nIn a 2013 dispute between CBS and Time Warner Cable, CBS's bargaining position improved as the National Football League season approached. In the wake of the settlement, the broadcaster increased its per subscriber fee from an estimated $.58 to between $1 and $2, setting a new standard for retransmission fees commanded by over-the-air broadcasters. CBS also retained digital rights to its contents for resale to online distributors. The agreement was expected to earn the broadcaster an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion in additional revenues by 2017.\n\nOn the other hand, some regional sports networks have seemingly overplayed their hand. CSN Houston, a partnership between the Houston Rockets, the Houston Astros and Comcast, was subsequently placed under bankruptcy protection after its October 2012 debut. While Comcast carried the channel, DirecTV, Dish Network and other competitors did not, citing the fee: $3.40 per month, one of the highest of any comparable channel. As a result, CSN Houston was unavailable to about 60% of the region's households. The owner of the Astros subsequently dropped high-salaried players, and the team finished the 2013 season with the worst record in baseball.\n\nIn January 2013, Time Warner Cable signed an $8.35 billion, 25-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers to carry and resell the Dodger-owned SportsNet LA. But in the 2014 season, the channel was only carried by TWC itself and a few smaller distributors, leaving about 70% of the region uncovered. TWC had reportedly asked other distributors for an initial $4 to $5 per-month per-subscriber, with carriage fees increasing yearly over the length of the contract. Those distributors, most notably DirecTV, balked at the terms. Los Angeles Times business reporter Joe Flint called the standoff a potentially \"definitive moment for the world of sports programming, as the industry realizes that exorbitantly priced television deals can backfire.\"<ref name=\"Flint 7/14\"></ref> Other teams with whose regional sports networks did not gain traction include the Kansas City Royals and Minnesota Twins.\n\nSome smaller cable companies, relying on revenues from broadband subscriptions, have been more willing to drop a bundled service, even at the cost of fewer television subscribers. In 2014, for example, Suddenlink, the seventh largest U.S. cable provider, entered into a lengthy dispute with Viacom, which continued even though Suddenlink lost 32,600 television subscribers over the first three months. But the company's net income was up 65 percent over the same period the previous year because it retained most of those subscribers as broadband customers. The conflict was only resolved in May 2017, after Altice USA purchased Suddenlink and came to a new carriage agreement with Viacom which also encompassed Altice's New York metro Optimum service.\n\n"}

Contained within it is the recognition of \"the urgent need for the universal application to women of the rights and principles with regard to equality, security, liberty, integrity and dignity of all human beings\". The resolution is often seen as complementary to, and a strengthening of, the work of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. It recalls and embodies the same rights and principles as those enshrined in such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Articles 1 and 2 provide the most widely used definition of violence against women. As a consequence of the resolution, in 1999, the General Assembly, led by the representative from the Dominican Republic, designated 25 November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.\n\nThe international recognition that women have a right to a life free from violence is a recent one. Historically, their struggles with violence, and with the impunity that often protects the perpetrators, is linked with their fight to overcome discrimination. Since its founding the United Nations has concerned itself with the advancement of women's rights, but did not specifically target the high rates of female targeted violence until 1993. One of the aims of the resolution was to overturn the prevailing governmental stance that violence against women was a private, domestic matter not requiring state intervention. To mark International Women's Day on 8 March 1993, General Secretary, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, issued a statement in preparation of the declaration explicitly outlining the UN's role in the 'promotion' and 'protection' of women's rights:\n\"The struggle for women's rights, and the task of creating a new United Nations, able to promote peace and the values which nurture and sustain it, are one and the same. Today - more than ever - the cause of women is the cause of all humanity.\"\n\nArticles 1 and 2 of the resolution provide the most widely used definition of violence against women.\n\nArticle One:\nFor the purposes of this Declaration, the term \"violence against women\" means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. \n\nArticle Two:\nViolence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following:\n\nAs a consequence of the declaration on 4 March 1994, the Commission on Human Rights adopted Resolution 1994/45 in which it decided to appoint Radhika Coomaraswamy as its first United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, including its causes and consequences. The Special Rapporteur has a mandate to collect and analyse data from governments, treaty bodies, specialized agencies, NGOs, and other interested parties, and to respond effectively to such information. Furthermore, they also have a role in making recommendations on an international, national and regional level, as well as liaising with other Special Rapporteurs, special representatives, working groups and independent experts of the Commission on Human Rights.\n\nOn 18 June 2009 the United Nations Human Rights Council appointed Rashida Manjoo as the third incumbent of the role after the tenure of her predecessor, Dr. Yakin Erturk, came to an end.\n\nMany advocates of Women's Rights as Human Rights have expressed concerns that much of the ground gained by the declaration has been threatened by the rise of more conservative forces within the international community. In March 2003, during a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women the delegate from Iran objected to the inclusion of a paragraph that called on governments to \"condemn violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition, or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination as set out in the Declaration of the Elimination of Violence against Women.\" Representatives from Egypt, Pakistan, Sudan and US also raised objections; making it the first ever diplomatic failure at the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\n\nEach year, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women marks the start of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence. Human Rights organisations such as Center for Women's Global Leadership, Unifem, Women Won't Wait, Women for a Change, Women's Aid, and other groups join together to speak out against gender violence and to promote the rights and principles of the declaration.\nOn 10 April 2009, Amnesty International held a demonstration in Narayanghat, Nepal, to highlight the plight of women's rights activists after the Nepalese state failed to protect two activists from violent attacks and, finally, their murder. Despite ratifying the declaration, Nepal had failed to abide by Article 4-c which asserts the clear obligation of states to: \"Exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "51576426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51576426", "title": "Ditema tsa Dinoko", "text": "Ditema tsa Dinoko\n\nDitema tsa Dinoko (Sesotho for \"Ditema syllabary\"), also known by its IsiZulu name, \"Isibheqe Sohlamvu\", and various other related names in different languages, is a constructed writing system (specifically, a featural syllabary) designed for the Southern Bantu languages (for example, for Sesotho, Setswana, IsiZulu, IsiXhosa, SiSwati, SiPhuthi, Xitsonga, EMakhuwa, ChiNgoni, SiLozi, or Tshivenḓa), developed from antecedent ideographic traditions of the Southern African region. Its visual appearance is inspired by these, including the traditional litema arts style.\n\nThe Ditema / Isibheqe syllabary has the capacity to represent the full phonological range of these \"sintu\" languages (in the Nguni, Sotho-Tswana, Venḓa, Tsonga and Tonga-Inhambane groups) consistently under one orthography. \n\nThis includes languages that are unstandardised in the Latin alphabet such as the East Sotho languages (Sepulana, Sekutswe and Hipai), or the Tekela languages, which, with the exception of SiSwati, are not official languages. Orthographic support for these languages is for instance evidenced in the \"ingungwana\" grapheme, which indicates vowel nasality — a feature of Tekela languages.\n\nThe script operates as a syllabary, as each freestanding symbol represents a syllable, with graphemes for consonant and vowel sounds combined together into syllable blocks (\"amabheqe\"), in a similar fashion to Hangeul. When the syllable being represented is not a syllabic nasal, these symbols are formed from a triangular or chevron-shaped grapheme representing the nucleus of the syllable, with the attached \"ongwaqa\" or consonant graphemes representing the onset of the syllable or its mode of articulation. Syllabic nasals are represented as circles that fill the whole \"ibheqe\" or syllable block.\n\nThe vowel graphemes (\"onkamisa\") form the basis of each \"ibheqe\" or syllable block, as the nucleus of each syllable, with the \"ongwaqa\" or consonant graphemes positioned in and around them. \n\nThe direction of each \"ibheqe\" indicates the quality of the vowel for each of the seven vowel phonemes:\n\n• \"Intombi\", the upward facing triangle: /i/\n\n• \"Isoka\", the downward facing triangle: /a/\n\n• \"Umkhonto\", the upward facing chevron: /u/\n\n• The leftward facing triangle: /ɛ/ \n\n• The rightward facing triangle: /ɔ/\n\n• The leftward facing chevron: /e/ \n\n• The rightward facing chevron: /o/\n\nThere is an eighth \"vowel\" represented by the downward facing chevron, which is an \"empty vowel\", and is mostly used for foreign words to represent a standalone consonant, often as a syllable coda, which does not occur in sintu languages having CV phonology.\n\nThe apex of the triangle or chevron corresponds to vowel height or frontedness, with high vowels /i/ and /u/ pointing upwards and the low vowel /a/ pointing downwards. Likewise, the front vowels /ɛ/ and /e/ point leftwards and the back vowels /ɔ/ and /o/ point rightwards. \n\nVowel nasality is indicated with the \"ingungwana\" grapheme, which is a solid dot outside the triangle separated from the apex, as in the word \"phãsi\" below:\n\nConsonants (\"ongwaqa\") are composed of one or more graphemes, at least one of which indicates the place and manner of articulation and thereafter they represent co-articulations or onset clusters and the articulatory mode, whether it be voiced, prenasalised, implosive, ejective, modal, or a combination thereof.\n\nThe position of the consonant graphemes largely corresponds to the place of articulation:\n\n• Labials and nasals are positioned outside the triangle at the apex.\n\n• Alveolars are across the middle of the triangle from side to side.\n\n• Velars and palatals are at the base.\n\n• Laterals are outside the triangle on one side. \n\n• Dentals are two lines across the triangle from side to side, parallel to each other.\n\nThe shape of the consonant grapheme corresponds to the manner of articulation:\n\n• Curved lines indicate fricatives.\n\n• Their straight line counterparts in the same positions indicate plosives. \n\n• Approximants and trills are represented with two lines either parallel or at a right angle to each other, with a tap or flap being the latter arrangement, one line bisecting the other at its centrepoint without crossing it. \n\n• Retroflex whistled consonants and postalveolar fricatives are represented as loops. \n\n• Nasals are represented as circles at the apex of the triangle. Lines inside the circles distinguish the nasals from each other.\n\n• Clicks are a bottomless hourglass shape.\n\n• Syllabic laterals and trills are represented with duplication of the ordinary lateral and trill graphemes.\n\nSyllabic nasals or \"amaqanda\" are unique in that they occupy the entire \"ibheqe\" space as circles. They are distinguished from each other with lines inside them that operate according to the same principles as above. \n\nThese graphemes can combine with each other in an order in accordance with the phonotactics of sintu languages, and they also can combine with the articulatory mode graphemes. \n\nThere are three graphemic markers of articulatory mode:\n• For unvoiced consonants, a solid dot within the triangle indicates a glotallised (ejected) consonant or a modal click consonant.\n\n• For voiced consonants the solid dot inside the triangle indicates an implosive consonant or, in the case of languages where there are no implosives, a modal consonant.\n\n• The absence of the dot indicates breathy voice in the case of voiced consonants, and aspiration in the case of voiceless consonants.\n\n• \"Uphimbo\", or the voicing line, running from the apex of the triangle to the base (or until inline with the ends of the chevron), indicates consonant voicing. \n\n• If the voicing line occurs as the only \"ungwaqa\" in the \"ibheqe\", it indicates a voiced glottal fricative /ɦ/. \n\n• In languages that distinguish between breathy voiced and modal nasals/trills, the voicing line indicates breathy voice when occurring with these consonant graphemes.\n\n• Prenasalised consonants are marked with an open circle at the apex of the triangle called \"ingungu\". These occur with other consonant graphemes, and are distinct from the bilabial nasal /m/ that occurs on its own. No additional lines need be added to the \"ingungu\" when it occurs with other \"ongwaqa\" as the place of articulation is given by them and need not be marked in the nasal grapheme. \n\n• For clicks, the \"ingungu\" marks a nasal click consonant, with the prenasalised clicks (e.g. <nkq>) requiring the addition of a solid dot (glottalisation), in which case the \"ingungu\" denotes prenasalisation.\n"}

{"id": "23289427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23289427", "title": "Estonian phonology", "text": "Estonian phonology\n\nThis article is about the phonology and phonetics of the Estonian language.\n\nThere are 9 vowels and 36 diphthongs, 28 of which are native to Estonian. All nine vowels can appear as the first component of a diphthong, but only occur as the second component. A vowel characteristic of Estonian is the unrounded back vowel , which may be close-mid back, close back, or close-mid central.\n\n\nThere are very few instances of vowel allophony; for instance, the long is pronounced as the diphthong in certain environments.\n\nSimple vowels can be inherently short or long, written with single and double vowel letters respectively. Diphthongs are always inherently long. Furthermore, long vowels and diphthongs have two suprasegmental lengths. This is described further below.\n\n\nLike the vowels, most consonants can be inherently short or long. For the plosives, this distinction is reflected as a distinction in tenseness/voicing, with short plosives being voiced and long plosives being voiceless. This distinction only applies fully for single consonants after stressed syllables. In other environments, the length or tenseness/voicing distinctions may be neutralised:\n\nIn addition, long consonants and clusters also have two suprasegmental lengths, like the vowels. This is described below.\n\nNon-phonemic palatalization generally occurs before front vowels. In addition, about 0.15% of the vocabulary features fully phonemic palatalization, where palatalization occurs without the front vowel. A front vowel did historically occur there, but was lost, leaving the palatalization as its only trace (a form of cheshirization). It mostly occurs word-finally, but in some cases it may also occur word-medially. Thus, palatalization does not necessarily need a front vowel, and palatalized vs. plain continuants can be articulated. Palatalization is not indicated in the standard orthography.\n\nThe stress in Estonian is usually on the first syllable, as was the case in Proto-Finnic. There are a few exceptions with the stress on the second syllable: \"aitäh\" ('thanks'), \"sõbranna\" ('female friend'). In loanwords, the original stress can be borrowed as well: \"ideaal\" ('ideal'), \"professor\" ('professor'). The stress is weak, and as length levels already control an aspect of \"articulation intensity\", most words appear evenly stressed.\n\nSyllables can be divided into short and long. Syllables ending in a short vowel are short, while syllables ending in a long vowel, diphthong or consonant are long. The length of vowels, consonants and thus syllables is \"inherent\" in the sense that it is tied to a particular word and is not subject to morphological alternations.\n\nAll stressed long syllables can possess a suprasegmental length feature. When a syllable has this feature, any long vowel or diphthong in the syllable is lengthened further, as is any long consonant or consonant cluster at the end of that syllable. A long syllable without suprasegmental length is termed \"long\", \"half-long\", \"light\" or \"length II\" and is denoted in IPA as or . A long syllable with suprasegmental length is termed \"overlong\", \"long\", \"heavy\" or \"length III\", denoted in IPA as or . For consistency, this article employs the terms \"half-long\" and \"overlong\" and uses and , respectively, to denote them.\n\nBoth the regular short-long distinction and the suprasegmental length are distinctive, so that Estonian effectively has three distinctive vowel and consonant lengths, the distinction between the second and third length levels being at a level larger than the phoneme, such as the syllable or the foot. In addition to realizing greater phonetic duration, overlength in modern Estonian involves a pitch distinction where falling pitch is realized in syllables that are overlong and level pitch is realized in syllables that are short or long.\n\nThe suprasegmental length is not indicated in the standard orthography except for the plosives for which a single voiceless letter represents a half-long consonant while a double voiceless letter represents an overlong consonant. There are many minimal pairs and also some minimal triplets which differ only by length:\n\nThe extra length distinction has a number of origins:\n\n"}
{"id": "9281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9281", "title": "Evolutionary linguistics", "text": "Evolutionary linguistics\n\nEvolutionary linguistics is a subfield of psycholinguistics that studies the psychosocial and cultural factors involved in the origin of language and the development of linguistic universals. The main challenge in this research is the lack of empirical data: spoken language leaves practically no traces. This led to the abandonment of the field for more than a century, despite the common origins of language hinted at by the relationships among individual languages established by the field of historical linguistics. Since the late 1980s, the field has been revived in the wake of progress made in the related fields of biolinguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, evolutionary anthropology, evolutionary psychology, universal grammar, and cognitive science.\n\nInspired by the natural sciences, especially by biology, August Schleicher (1821–1868) became the first to compare changing languages to evolving species. He introduced the representation of language families as an evolutionary tree (\"Stammbaumtheorie\") in articles published in 1853. \"Stammbaumtheorie\" proved very productive for comparative linguistics, but did not solve the major problem of studying the origin of language: the lack of fossil records. Some scholars abandoned the question of the origin of language as unsolvable. Famously, the \"Société Linguistique de Paris\" in 1866 refused to admit any further papers on the subject.\nJoseph Jastrow published a gestural theory of the evolution of language in the seventh volume of \"Science\", 1886.\n\nThe field re-appeared in 1988 in the \"Linguistic Bibliography\" as a subfield of psycholinguistics. In 1990, Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom published their paper \"Natural Language and Natural Selection\" which strongly argued for an adaptationist approach to language origins. Development strengthened further with the establishment (in 1996) of a series of conferences on the Evolution of Language (subsequently known as \"Evolang\"), promoting a scientific, multi-disciplinary approach to the issue, and interest from major academic publishers (e.g., the \"Studies in the Evolution of Language\" series has appeared with Oxford University Press since 2001) and from scientific journals.\n\nEvolutionary linguistics as a field is rapidly emerging as a result of developments in neighboring disciplines. To what extent language's features are determined by genes, a hotly debated dichotomy in linguistics, has had new light shed upon it by the discovery of the \"FOXP2\" gene. An English family with a severe, heritable language dysfunction was found to have a defective copy of this gene. Mutations of the corresponding gene in mice (\"FOXP2\" is fairly well conserved; modern humans share the same allele as Neanderthals) cause reductions in size and vocalization rate. If both copies are damaged, the Purkinje layer (a part of the cerebellum that contains better-connected neurons than any other) develops abnormally, runting is more common, and pups die within weeks due to inadequate lung development. Additionally, higher presence of \"FOXP2\" in songbirds is correlated to song changes, with downregulation causing incomplete and inaccurate song imitation in zebra finches. In general, evidence suggests that the protein is vital to neuroplasticity. There is little support, however, for the idea that \"FOXP2\" is 'the grammar gene' or that it had much to do with the relatively recent emergence of syntactical speech.\n\nAnother controversial dichotomy is the question of whether human language is solely human or on a continuum with (admittedly far removed) animal communication systems. Studies in ethology have forced researchers to reassess many claims of uniquely human abilities for language and speech. For instance, Tecumseh Fitch has argued that the descended larynx is not unique to humans. Similarly, once held uniquely human traits such as formant perception, combinatorial phonology and compositional semantics are now thought to be shared with at least some nonhuman animal species. Conversely, Derek Bickerton and others argue that the advent of abstract words provided a mental basis for analyzing higher-order relations, and that any communication system that remotely resembles human language utterly relies on cognitive architecture that co-evolved alongside language.\n\nAs it leaves no fossils, language's form and even its presence are extremely hard or impossible to deduce from physical evidence. Computational modeling is now widely accepted as an approach to assure the internal consistency of language-evolution scenarios. Approximately one-third of all papers presented at the 2010 Evolution of Language conference rely at least in part on computer simulations.\n\nOne original researcher in the field is Luc Steels, head of the research units of Sony CSL in Paris and the AI Lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. He and his team are currently investigating ways in which artificial agents self-organize languages with natural-like properties and how meaning can co-evolve with language. Their research is based on the hypothesis that language is a complex adaptive system that emerges through adaptive interactions between agents and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of the agents. This research has been implemented in fluid construction grammar (FCG), a formalism for construction grammars that has been specially designed for the origins and evolution of language. The approach of computational modeling and the use of robotic agents grounded in real life is claimed to be theory independent. It enables the researcher to find out exactly what cognitive capacities are needed for certain language phenomena to emerge. It also focuses the researcher in formulating hypotheses in a precise and exact manner, whereas theoretical models often stay very vague.\n\nSome linguists, such as John McWhorter, have analyzed the evolution and construction of basic communication methods such as pidginization and creolization.\n\n\"Nativist\" models of \"universal grammar\" are informed by linguistic universals such as the existence of pronouns and demonstratives, and the similarities in each language's process of nominalization (the process of verbs becoming nouns) as well as the reverse, the process of turning nouns into verbs. This is a purely descriptive approach to what we mean by \"natural language\" without attempting to address its emergence.\n\nFinally there are those archaeologists and evolutionary anthropologists—among them Ian Watts, Camilla Power and Chris Knight (co-founder with James Hurford of the EVOLANG series of conferences)—who argue that 'the origin of language' is probably an insoluble problem. In agreement with Amotz Zahavi, Knight argues that language—being a realm of patent fictions—is a theoretical impossibility in a Darwinian world, where signals must be intrinsically reliable. If we are going to explain language's evolution, according to this view, we must tackle it as part of a wider one—the evolutionary emergence of symbolic culture as such.\n\nThe Evolution of Language International Conferences have been held biennially since 1996.\n\n"}

Lully wrote 8 out of 14 leading male roles for the voice; Charpentier, who was an haute-contre himself, composed extensively for the voice-part, as did Rameau and, later, Gluck. \n\nThe leading \"hautes-contre\" of the \"Académie Royale de Musique\" that created the main roles of Lully's operas, at the end of the seventeenth century, were Bernard Clédière and Louis Gaulard Dumesny. Notable \"hautes-contre\" of the eighteenth century’s first half included firstly Jean-François Tribou, who revived Lully style and operas in the twenties and in the thirties, then the mentioned Pierre Jélyotte and his substitutes, François Poirier et La Tour, all of whom sang Rameau's operas and Lully's revivals for the \"Académie Royale de Musique\", and finally Marc-François Bêche, who was engaged mainly in performances at court. After these came Joseph Legros, for whom Gluck wrote his main \"haute-contre\" roles, which included the title role in the 1774 version of \"Orphée et Eurydice\", and Achilles in \"Iphigénie en Aulide\". There is also an extensive repertoire of music for this voice in French \"airs de cour\" and in French solo cantatas of the Baroque period; \"hautes-contre\" sang in choirs as well, taking the part above more ordinary tenors, who were designated as \"taille\".\nThe nature of the \"haute-contre\" voice has been the subject of much debate, and the fact that, historically, English writers have translated the term as \"countertenor\" is not particularly helpful, since the meaning of that latter term has also been the subject of considerable musicological controversy; both terms are ultimately derived from the Latin \"contratenor\" (see countertenor). It is now generally accepted that the \"hautes-contre\" sang in what voice scientists term \"modal\" (i.e. \"speaking\" voice), perhaps using falsetto for their highest notes. A typical solo range for this voice was C to D, considering that French eighteenth-century pitch was as much as a whole tone lower than that of today. Though this high-pitched range might lead one to think of the \"haute-contre\" as a light voice, historical evidence does not bear this out: Jélyotte was much praised for the strength of his high register, the astronomer and traveller Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande commenting that \"one takes more pleasure in hearing a large voice than a small one\". Lalande stated that Jélyotte's range was identical to that of the famous tenor Angelo Amorevoli; he also remarked that \"all those who succeeded Legros had to shout to arrive at the tones of an haute-contre, except for Rousseau: but he had the smallest sound\".\n\nThe \"haute-contre\" is regarded by some authorities as similar to, or indeed identical with, the voice-type described in Italian as \"tenore contraltino\". Although not unknown at an earlier date (for example the title-role in Mozart's \"Mitridate\"), roles for this voice were particularly numerous at the beginning of the nineteenth century: for example Lindoro in Rossini's \"L'italiana in Algeri\" or Rodrigo in \"Otello\". Rossini also wrote roles in French for this type of voice, which may thus be regarded as a direct continuation of the earlier \"haute-contre\" tradition. These include the protagonist of \"Le Comte Ory\", Néocles in \"Le siège de Corinthe\" and Arnold in \"\"Guillaume Tell\"\", all of which were written for the great French tenor Adolphe Nourrit.\n\nRecently, with a revival of interest in and the performance of French baroque repertoire, several high tenors have come to prominence in \"haute-contre\" repertoire. These include Mark Padmore,Anders J. Dahlin, Rogers Covey-Crump, Jean-Paul Fouchécourt, Paul Agnew and Cyril Auvity. None of these sing the French Baroque repertoire to the exclusion of all others, and all are involved, to a greater or lesser extent, in the performance of mainstream tenor repertoire.\n\nSee List of French haute-contre roles\n\n"}

{"id": "654542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=654542", "title": "José de Alencar", "text": "José de Alencar\n\nJosé Martiniano de Alencar (May 1, 1829 – December 12, 1877) was a Brazilian lawyer, politician, orator, novelist and dramatist. He is considered to be one of the most famous and influential Brazilian Romantic novelists of the 19th century, and a major exponent of the literary tradition known as \"Indianism\". Sometimes he signed his works with the pen name Erasmo.\n\nHe was patron of the 23rd chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.\n\nJosé Martiniano de Alencar was born in Messejana, Fortaleza, Ceará, on May 1, 1829, to politician José Martiniano Pereira de Alencar and his cousin Ana Josefina de Alencar. His family was a rich and influential clan in Northeastern Brazil, his grandmother being famous landowner Barbara Pereira de Alencar, heroine of the Pernambucan Revolution. Moving to São Paulo in 1844, he graduated in Law at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo in 1850 and started his career in law in Rio de Janeiro. Invited by his friend Francisco Otaviano, he became a collaborator for the journal \"Correio Mercantil\". He also wrote many chronicles for the \"Diário do Rio de Janeiro\" and the \"Jornal do Commercio\". Alencar would compile all the chronicles he wrote for these newspapers in 1874, under the name \"Ao Correr da Pena\".\n\nIt was in the \"Diário do Rio de Janeiro\", during the year of 1856, that Alencar gained notoriety, writing the \"Cartas sobre A Confederação dos Tamoios\", under the pseudonym Ig. In them, he bitterly criticized the homonymous poem by Gonçalves de Magalhães. Even the Brazilian Emperor Pedro II, who esteemed Magalhães very much, participated in this polemic, albeit under a pseudonym. Also in 1856, he wrote and published under \"feuilleton\" form his first romance, \"Cinco Minutos\", that received critical acclaim. In the following year, his breakthrough novel, \"O Guarani\", was released; it would be adapted into a famous opera by Brazilian composer Antônio Carlos Gomes 13 years later. \"O Guarani\" would be first novel of what is informally called Alencar's \"Indianist Trilogy\" – a series of three novels by Alencar that focused on the foundations of the Brazilian nation, and on its indigenous peoples and culture. The other two novels, \"Iracema\" and \"Ubirajara\", would be published on 1865 and 1874, respectively. Although called a trilogy, the three books are unrelated in its plots.\n\nAlencar was affiliated with the Conservative Party of Brazil, being elected as a general deputy for Ceará. He was the Brazilian Minister of Justice from 1868 to 1870, having famously opposed the abolition of slavery. He also planned to be a senator, but Pedro II never appointed him, under the pretext of Alencar being too young; with his feelings hurt, he would abandon politics later.\n\nHe was very close friends with the also famous writer Machado de Assis, who wrote an article in 1866 praising his novel \"Iracema\", that was published the year before, comparing his Indianist works to Gonçalves Dias, saying that \"Alencar was in prose what Dias was in poetry\". When Assis founded the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1897, he chose Alencar as the patron of his chair.\n\nIn 1864 he married Georgina Augusta Cochrane, daughter of an eccentric British aristocrat. They would have six children – Augusto (who would be the Brazilian Minister of External Relations in 1919, and also the Brazilian ambassador on the United States from 1920 to 1924), Clarisse, Ceci, Elisa, Mário (who would be a journalist and writer, and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters) and Adélia. (It is implied that Mário de Alencar was actually an illegitimate son of Machado de Assis, a fact that inspired Assis to write his famous novel \"Dom Casmurro\".)\n\nAlencar died in Rio de Janeiro in 1877, a victim of tuberculosis. A theatre in Fortaleza, the Theatro José de Alencar, was named after him.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51738001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51738001", "title": "Latin syntax", "text": "Latin syntax\n\nLatin syntax is the part of Latin grammar that covers such matters as word order, the use of cases, tenses and moods, and the construction of simple and compound sentences.\n\nThe study of Latin syntax in a systematic way was particularly a feature of the late 19th century, especially in Germany. For example, in the 3rd edition of \"Gildersleeve's Latin Grammar\" (1895), the reviser, Gonzalez Lodge, mentions 38 scholars whose works have been used in its revision; of these 31 wrote in German, five in English and two in French. (The English scholars include Roby and Lindsay).\n\nIn the twentieth century, the German tradition was continued with the publication of two very comprehensive grammars: the \"Ausführliche Grammatik der lateinischen Sprache\" by Raphael Kühner and Karl Stegmann (1912, first edition 1879), and the \"Lateinische Grammatik\" by Manu Leumann, J.B. Hofmann, and Anton Szantyr (revised edition Munich 1977, first edition 1926). Among works published in English may be mentioned E.C. Woodcock's \"A New Latin Syntax\" (1959). More recently, taking advantage of computerised texts, three major works have been published on Latin word order, one by the American scholars Andrew Devine and Laurence Stephens (2006), and two (adopting a different approach) by the Czech scholar Olga Spevak (2010 and 2014).\n\nLatin word order is relatively free. The verb may be found at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence; an adjective may precede or follow its noun (\"vir bonus\" or \"bonus vir\" both mean 'a good man'); and a genitive may precede or follow its noun ('the enemies' camp' can be both \"hostium castra\" and \"castra hostium\"; the latter is more common). There are also stylistic differences between Latin authors; for example, while Caesar always writes \"castra pōnit\" 'he sets up camp', Livy more often writes \"pōnit castra\". \n\nThere are however certain constraints; for example, in prose a monosyllabic preposition such as \"in\" 'in' generally precedes its noun (e.g. \"in Italiā\" 'in Italy'). Moreover, even though adjectives can both precede and follow the noun, there is a tendency for different kinds of adjectives to take different positions; for example adjectives of size usually come before the noun (\"magnā vōce\" 'in a loud voice', rarely \"vōce magnā\"), while 'modifiers that are more important than their noun or that specify it' (e.g. \"Via Appia\" 'the Appian Way') usually follow it.\n\nTo explain Latin word order there are two main schools of thought. One, represented by Devine and Stephens (2006), argues from the point of view of generative grammar, and maintains that Latin prose has a basic underlying \"neutral\" word order, from which authors deviate for reasons of emphasis, topicalisation, rhythm, and so on. According to Devine and Stephens, the basic order in broad scope focus sentences is as follows:\n\n\nThe other approach, represented by Panhuis (1982) and Olga Spevak (2010), examines Latin word order from the point of view of functional grammar. Rejecting the idea that there is a basic word order, this approach seeks to explain word order in terms of pragmatic factors, such as topic and focus, and semantic ones (1st person before 2nd, human before animals or things, agent before patient, etc.).\n\nThe order of words is often chosen according to the emphasis required by the author. One way of emphasising a word is to reverse the usual order. For example, in the opening sentence of Caesar's \"Gallic War\", the usual order of numeral and noun \"trīs partīs\" 'three parts' is reversed to emphasise the number 'three':\n\nAnother technique used by Latin authors is to separate a phrase and put another word or phrase in the middle, for example:\n\nThe technical term for this kind of separation is \"hyperbaton\" (Greek for 'stepping over'); it is described by Devine and Stephens as 'perhaps the most distinctively alien feature of Latin word order'.\n\nPlacing the verb at or near the beginning of a clause sometimes indicates that the action is sudden or unexpected:\n\nSplitting up an adjective-noun phrase and bringing the adjective to the beginning of the sentence can highlight it. In the following example from Cicero, the splitting of \"cruentum\" 'blood-stained' and \"pugiōnem\" 'dagger' creates a dramatic effect:\n\nConsiderations of rhythm and elegance also play a part in Latin word order. For example, Pliny the Younger begins a letter as follows:\n\nIn this sentence, the object (\"magnum prōventum poētārum\" 'a great crop of poets') has been brought forward to highlight it. The other striking feature is the order \"annus hic\" for the more usual \"hic annus\" 'this year'. Two reasons which might be suggested are Pliny's fondness for ending a sentence with the rhythm − u − − u − and also no doubt because of the elegant assonance of the vowels \"a-u-i a-u-i\" in the last three words.\n\nLatin has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and two numbers (singular and plural). Pronouns, adjectives, participles, and the numbers one to three have to agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to:\n\n\nThe same three genders are also found in the plural:\n\n\nIn Latin, words referring to males are always masculine, words referring to females are usually feminine. (An exception is \"scortum\" (neuter) 'a whore'.) Words referring to things can be any of the three genders, for example \"mōns\" 'mountain' (masculine), \"arbor\" 'tree' (feminine), \"nōmen\" 'name' (neuter). However, there are certain rules; for example, nouns with the suffixes \"-a\" (unless referring to men), \"-tiō\", \"-tās\" are feminine; the names of trees, islands, and countries, such as \"pīnus\" 'pine', \"Cyprus\" 'Cyprus', and \"Aegyptus\" 'Egypt' are also usually feminine, and so on. Some nouns such as \"parēns\" 'parent' can vary between masculine and feminine and are called of \"common\" gender.\n\nWhen words of different genders are combined, the adjective is usually masculine if referring to people, neuter if referring to things:\n\nHowever, sometimes the adjective may agree with the nearest noun.\n\nNouns, pronouns, and adjectives in Latin change their endings according to their function in the sentence. The different endings are called different 'cases'. Case endings of a similar kind are also found in other languages, such as Ancient and Modern Greek, German, Russian, Finnish, Sanskrit, Armenian and Turkish.\n\nThe six cases most commonly used in Latin and their main meanings are given below. The cases are presented here in the order which has been used in Britain and countries influenced by Britain ever since the publication of Kennedy's Latin Primer in the 19th century, as opposed to the traditional order – Nom, Gen, Dat, Acc, Voc, Abl – still used in the United States and most European countries:\n\n\nAnother case is the Locative, which is used mostly with the names of cities (e.g. \"Rōmae\" 'in Rome') and a very limited number of ordinary nouns (e.g. \"domī\" 'at home').\n\nFor the most part the use of cases is quite straightforward. The following examples from Caesar show the cases in use in a basic sense:\n\nHere \"Cūriō\" as subject of the verb is nominative, \"Mārcium\" as direct object is accusative; \"Uticam\" is also accusative as it is the goal or object of motion; and \"nāvibus\" 'with the ships' has the ablative ending, which means 'with'.\n\n\nHere \"Pompeius\" is subject (Nom.), \"Lūceriā\" shows another meaning of the ablative ending, namely 'from', and \"Canusium\" is again accusative of goal. Note that with names of cities there is no need to add a preposition such as \"ad\", but the accusative case alone indicates 'to'.\n\n\nHere \"mīlitibus\", although it shares the same ending as the ablative \"nāvibus\" in the previous example, is clearly dative, meaning 'to or for the soldiers' (usually when a noun has an ambiguous ending such as \"-īs\", \"-ibus\" or \"-ēbus\" it will be interpreted as dative if it is a person, ablative if it is a thing).\n\nHowever, the description of the use of cases is not always simple. The classification of the uses of the dative alone takes up nearly twelve pages in Woodcock's \"A New Latin Syntax\" and ten pages in Gildersleeve and Lodge. For example, when asking someone's name, a Roman would say:\n\nThis is an example of the Dative of Possession, as in:\n\nAnother surprising idiomatic use is the \"Dative of the Person Affected\":\n\nThe dative is also used with verbs of fighting with someone:\n\nAnother idiom is the \"Predicative Dative\" used with the verb 'to be' in phrases such as \"ūsuī esse\" 'to be of use', \"labōrī esse\" 'to be a trouble (to someone)'.\n\nMany verbs also which in English take a direct object are used in Latin intransitively with a dative noun or pronoun, e.g. \"persuādeō\" 'I persuade', \"crēdō\" 'I believe', \"resistō\" 'I resist'.\n\nFrequently, to make the meaning more precise, a noun in the accusative or ablative is preceded by a preposition such as \"in\" 'in, into', \"ad\" 'to', \"cum\" 'with', or \"ex\" 'out of'. This is especially so if the noun refers to a person. For example: \n\nHowever, when the meaning of an accusative or an ablative is clear (for example \"Canusium\" (Acc) 'to Canusium', \"nāvibus\" (Abl) 'with the ships', \"posterō diē\" (Abl) 'on the following day'), the case ending alone is sufficient to give the meaning. Unlike in Greek, prepositions are not used in Latin with the dative or genitive.\n\nFour prepositions can be followed by more than one case, depending on their meaning. These are \"in\" 'in' (Abl), 'into' (Acc.); \"sub\" 'under' (Abl.), 'to the foot of' (Acc.); \"super\" 'over, above' (Acc.), 'concerning' (Abl.); and \"subter\" 'under' (usually with Acc.)\n\nPrepositions almost always precede their noun or pronoun, except that \"cum\" 'with' follows a personal pronoun, e.g. \"mēcum\" 'with me' and sometimes a relative pronoun (\"quīcum\", \"quōcum\" and \"cum quō\" are all possible for 'with whom'). There are occasional exceptions, especially with two-syllable prepositions after pronouns, e.g. \"haec inter\" (Virgil) 'in the midst of these'. \n\nSometimes when the noun has an adjective it is placed before the preposition for emphasis, e.g. \"magnā cum cūrā\" 'with great care' (Cicero), but this is not an invariable rule. Occasionally also the opposite order (noun-preposition-adjective) may be used in poetry and later prose, e.g. \"silvā lupus in Sabīnā\" (Horace) 'a wolf in the Sabine forest', or \"metū in magnō\" (Livy) 'in great fear'.\n\nLatin has six main tenses in the indicative mood, which are illustrated below using the verb \"facere\" 'to make' or 'to do':\n\nThe verb \"sum\" 'I am', which is irregular, has the tenses \"sum\", \"erō\", \"eram\", \"fuī\", \"fuerō\", \"fueram\". Some verbs (conjugations 1 and 2) instead of the Future \"-am\", \"-ēs\", \"-et\" etc. have a different future ending in \"-bō\", \"-bis\", \"-bit\", e.g. \"amābō\" 'I will love'.\n\nTo these six ordinary tenses may be added various \"periphrastic\" tenses, made from a participle and part of the verb \"sum\" 'I am', such as \"factūrus eram\" 'I was about to do'.\n\nFor the most part these tenses are used in a fairly straightforward way; however, there are certain idiomatic uses that may be noted.\n\nThe present tense can refer to a current situation:\n\nIt can also refer to an event which takes place at the moment of speaking:\n\nThe present tense is often used in narrative in a past sense, especially when the writer is describing an exciting moment in the story. This is known as the 'historic present':\n\nAfter \"dum\" 'while', the present has an imperfect meaning:\n\nThe present can sometimes mean 'has been doing', usually with a length of time and \"iam\" 'now':\n\nThe future tense can describe an event or a situation in the near or distant future:\n\nAfter \"cum\" 'when' or \"sī\" 'if' referring to a future time, usually the future is used where English has a present tense:\n\nThe imperfect tense can describe a situation that used to take place regularly or habitually:\n\nIt can also describe a situation that was temporarily taking place at a particular moment:\n\nAnother use is to describe what someone was trying to do, or intending to do, or about to do, but which never actually took place:\n\nWhen used with \"iam\" and a length of time it means 'had been doing':\n\nSometimes in letters a writer imagines himself in the position of the recipient and uses a past tense to describe an event which for the writer himself is present:\n\nThe perfect most frequently narrates an event in the past:\n\nThe perfect can also be used like the English present perfect ('I have done'):\n\nThe three verbs \"ōdī\" 'I hate', \"meminī\" 'I remember', and \"nōvī\" 'I know', are used in the perfect tense but have the meaning of a present tense:\n\nThe perfect, not the imperfect, is used when a situation is said to have lasted in the past for a certain length of time, unless \"iam\" 'now' is added:\n\nThe perfect \"fuit\" 'it was once', 'it used to be' is also used for a situation which is no longer in existence:\n\nThe perfect is also necessary in sentences such as the following, which describe a permanent state, as opposed to the imperfect, which describes a temporary one:\n\nThe perfect must also be used with adverbs such as \"semel\" 'once', \"bis\" 'twice', \"ter\" 'three times', which imply that the situation is now over:\n\nThe future perfect is usually used in a sentence with 'if' or 'when', but it can sometimes be used on its own, as in the following sentence:\n\nThere is also an idiom using the future perfect of \"videō\":\n\nMore frequently it is found after \"sī\" 'if' or \"cum\" 'when'. The future perfect is used when the event in the 'if' clause will precede the main verb:\n\nThe pluperfect can be used as in English to describe an event that had happened earlier than the time of the narrative:\n\nThe pluperfect of \"ōdī\", \"nōvī\" and \"meminī\" has the meaning of an imperfect:\n\nIn addition to the active voice tenses listed above, Latin has a set of passive voice tenses as follows:\n\nThe three perfect tenses (Perfect, Future Perfect, and Pluperfect) are formed using the perfect participle together with part of the verb \"sum\" 'I am'. The ending of the participle changes according to the gender and number of the subject: \"captus est\" 'he was captured'; \"capta est\" 'she was captured'; \"captī sunt\" 'they were captured', and so on.\n\nA passive verb is generally used when it is unnecessary to indicate who did the action:\n\nWhen it is desired to show the agent or person(s) by whom the action was done, Latin uses the preposition \"ab\" or \"ā\" with the ablative case:\n\nWhen the agent is not a person but a thing, no preposition is used, but simply the ablative case:\n\nIn Latin, unlike English, only the direct object (not the indirect object) of an active verb can be made the subject of a passive verb. It is not correct to say in Latin 'the soldiers were being given their pay' but only 'pay was being given to the soldiers':\n\nAnother unusual feature of Latin, compared with English, is that intransitive verbs such as \"eō\" 'I go', \"veniō\" 'I come', \"pugnō\" 'I fight' and \"persuādeō\" (+ dative) 'I persuade' can be made passive, but only in a 3rd person singular impersonal form:\n\nThe infinitive of a passive verb ends in \"-ī\" (3rd conjugation) or \"-rī\" (other conjugations): \"capī\" 'to be captured, \"audīrī\" 'to be heard', etc.\n\nThe Perfect passive has an infinitive \"captus esse\" 'to have been captured', and there is also a rarely used Future passive infinitive made using the supine (\"captum\") plus the passive infinitive \"īrī\": \"captum īrī\" 'to be going to be captured'. It is typically used in indirect statements:\n\nMost of the verbs ending in \"-or\" are true passives in meaning (i.e. they represent actions which are done \"by someone\" or \"by something\"). However, there are a few which are ambivalent and can be either active or passive in meaning, such as \"vertor\" 'I turn' (intransitive) or 'I am turned', \"volvor\" 'I revolve' (intransitive) or 'I am rolled': \n\nIn addition, there are a few verbs such as \"proficīscor\" 'I set out', \"polliceor\" 'I promise', \"cōnor\" 'I try' which despite their passive endings have an active meaning. These verbs (which have no active counterpart) are called deponent verbs:\n\nAlthough most deponent verbs are intransitive, some of them such as \"sequor\" 'I follow' can take a direct object:\n\nDeponent verbs are frequently used in their perfect participle form (e.g. \"profectus\" 'having set out'):\n\nAs well as the indicative mood illustrated above, which is used for stating and asking facts, and an imperative mood, used for direct commands, Latin has a subjunctive mood, used to express nuances of meaning such as 'would', 'could', 'should', 'may' etc. (The word \"mood\" in a grammatical sense comes from the Latin \"modus\", and has no connection with the other meaning of 'mood', in the sense of 'emotional state', which comes from a Germanic root.)\n\nThere are four tenses of the subjunctive, which in the verb \"faciō\" are as follows:\n\nThe present subjunctive of 1st conjugation verbs ends in \"-em\" instead of \"-am\": \"amem\" 'I may love, I would love'.\n\nThe present subjunctive of the verbs \"sum\" 'I am', \"possum\" 'I am able', \"volō\" 'I want', \"nōlō\" 'I don't want' and \"mālō\" 'I prefer', ends in \"-im\": \"sim\" 'I may be, I would be', \"possim\" 'I may be able', \"velim\" 'I would like, I may wish', etc.\n\nThe imperfect subjunctive of every verb has the same form as the infinitive + \"-m\": \"essem\", \"possem\", \"vellem\", \"amārem\", \"vidērem\", \"īrem\" etc.\n\nThe subjunctive has numerous uses, ranging from what potentially might be true to what the speaker wishes or commands should happen. It is often translated with 'should', 'could', 'would', 'may' and so on, but in certain contexts, for example indirect questions or after the conjunction \"cum\" 'when' or 'since', it is translated as if it were an ordinary indicative verb.\n\nOften in English the subjunctive can be translated by an infinitive; for example, \"imperāvit ut īret\" (literally, 'he ordered that he should go') becomes in more idiomatic English 'he ordered him to go'.\n\nThe 'potential' subjunctive is used when the speaker imagines what potentially may, might, would, or could happen in the present or future or might have happened in the past. The negative of this kind is \"nōn\":\n\n\n\nAnother use is for what the speaker wishes may happen, or wishes had happened (the 'optative' subjunctive). The negative of this kind is \"nē\":\n\n\nIt can also represent what the speaker commands or suggests should happen (the 'jussive' subjunctive). The negative is again \"nē\":\n\n\nOne important use of the subjunctive mood in Latin is to indicate that the words are quoted; this applies for example to subordinate clauses in indirect speech:\n\nIt also applies to all indirect questions:\n\nWhen used in indirect speech or in an indirect question, the subjunctive is translated as if were the corresponding tense of the indicative.\n\nThe subjunctive mood is very frequently used in subordinate clauses following conjunctions.\n\nUsed with the indicative, the conjunction \"cum\" means 'at that time when', or 'whenever':\n\nUsed with the subjunctive, however, it frequently means 'at a time when'. When \"cum\" is used with the Imperfect subjunctive, a common way of translating it is 'while':\n\nWith the Pluperfect subjunctive, it often means 'after X happened':\n\nIt can also mean 'in view of the fact that' or 'since':\n\nAnother, less common, meaning is 'though':\n\nWhen followed by the indicative, the conjunction \"ut\" can mean 'as' (e.g. \"ut fit\" 'as generally happens') or 'as soon as' or 'when' (\"ut vēnī\" 'as soon as I came'). But with the subjunctive \"ut\" has the meaning 'that' or 'so that'.\n\nIt can represent purpose ('so that he could...'):\n\nIt can also be used to introduce an indirect command ('that he should...'):\n\nIt can also represent result (making what is known as a \"consecutive\" clause):\n\nOccasionally \"ut\" with the subjunctive can mean 'although'.\n\nAfter \"sī\" 'if', the subjunctive expresses an imagined or unreal situation:\n\n\nAfter \"nē\" 'that not', the subjunctive can express a negative purpose:\n\nIt can also introduce a negative indirect command:\n\nThe conjunction \"nē\" can also express a fear; in this case, the word 'not' must be omitted from the English translation:\n\nWhen used with the indicative, \"dum\" means 'while' or 'as long as'. But when followed by the subjunctive, it often means 'until':\n\nAnother meaning is 'provided that':\n\nThe conjunctions \"priusquam\" and \"antequam\" both mean 'before (something happened)'. If the event actually happened, the verb is usually in the indicative mood; but when the meaning is 'before there was a chance for it to happen', the verb is subjunctive:\n\nThe conjunction \"quīn\" (literally, 'how should it not be?') is always used after a negative verb or the equivalent, typically 'there is no doubt that', 'who does not know that...?', and so on. The words following \"quīn\" are always positive and usually state what was actually the case:\n\nAnother usage is after a negative verb such as 'I can't help doing' or 'he did not refrain from doing':\n\nEqually it can be used in sentences of the kind 'A didn't happen without B also happening':\n\nIn sentences like the following, there is potential for confusion, since the \"quīn\" clause, though positive in Latin, is translated in English with a negative:\n\nIn the following context, the words after \"quīn\" express not what actually happened but what very nearly happened:\n\nThe pronoun \"quī\" 'who' or 'which', when followed by a subjunctive, can mean 'a person such as' (generic):\n\nIt can also mean 'in order to' (purpose):\n\nAnother meaning is 'in view of the fact that' (giving an explanation), as in the following example, said jokingly of a consul who was elected on the last day of the year:\n\nAnother reason for using the subjunctive after \"quī\" is to show that the words of the \"quī\" clause are quoted or part of indirect speech:\n\nClearly here Paetus had written or stated \"I am giving you all the books which my brother left me\", and Cicero is quoting his words indirectly to Atticus.\n\nThe imperative mood is used for giving direct orders. The active form can be made plural by adding \"-te\":\n\nDeponent verbs such as \"proficīscor\" 'I set out' or \"sequor\" 'I follow' have an imperative ending in \"-re\" or -\"minī\" (plural):\n\nAn imperative is usually made negative by using \"nōlī(te)\" (literally, 'be unwilling!') plus the infinitive. However, in poetry an imperative can sometimes be made negative with the particle \"nē\":\n\nA negative order can also use the perfect subjunctive: \n\nLatin also has a Future imperative or 2nd imperative, ending in \"-tō(te)\", used to request someone to do something at a future time, or if something else happens first:\n\nThis imperative is very common in early writers such as Plautus and Cato:\n\n\n\nSome verbs have only the Second Imperative, for example \"scītō\" 'know', \"mementō\" 'remember'.\n\nThe 3rd person of this imperative is used in laws:\n\n\nOther requests are made with expressions such as \"cūrā ut\" 'take care to...', \"fac ut\" 'see to it that...' or \"cavē nē\" 'be careful that you don't...'\n\nThe future indicative can be used for polite commands:\n\nAlthough often referred to as a 'mood', the Latin infinitive is usually considered to be a verbal noun rather than a mood.\n\nLatin has three infinitives in the active voice, and three passive. Since \"faciō\" is irregular in the passive ('to be done' is \"fierī\", taken from the verb \"fīō\" 'I become'), they are here shown using the verb \"capiō\" 'I capture':\n\nActive:\n\nPassive:\n\nThe infinitives of \"sum\" 'I am' are \"esse\", \"fuisse\", and \"futūrus esse\" (often shortened to \"fore\"). \"Possum\" 'I am able' has \"posse\" and \"potuisse\", \"volō\" 'I want' has \"velle\" and \"voluisse\". Neither of these verbs has a Future infinitive, and the Present infinitive is used instead.\n\nThe Future infinitive is used only for indirect statements (see below).\n\nThe passive Future infinitive is rare, and is frequently replaced with a phrase using \"fore ut\".\n\nThe infinitive can be used as the subject, complement, or the object of a verb:\n\nIt can also be used, as in English, dependent on an adjective, or with verbs such as \"possum\" 'I am able' or \"volō\" 'I want':\n\n\nIt is likewise used, as in English, with verbs such as \"iubeō\" 'I order', \"vetō\" 'I forbid', \"patior\" 'I allow', \"volō\" 'I want' and so on, where the main verb takes an object in the accusative case: \n\nHowever, other verbs of similar meaning, such as \"imperō\" 'I order', \"persuādeō\" 'I persuade', and \"hortor\" 'I urge', are not used with an infinitive, but with \"ut\" and the subjunctive mood:\n\nAn infinitive or a succession of infinitives is sometimes used to represent a rapid or confused series of actions:\n\nA very common use of the infinitive in Latin, in which it differs from English, is its use for indirect statements, that is for sentences where a subordinate clause is dependent on a main verb such as 'he says', 'he knows', 'he pretends', 'he believes', 'he thinks' and so on. In Latin, instead of 'they pretend that they want', the idiom is to say 'they pretend themselves to want':\n\nSimilarly 'I'm glad you've arrived safely' becomes 'I am glad you to have arrived safely':\n\nIn this construction, the subject of the infinitive (\"sē\", \"tē\" in the above examples) is in the accusative case.\n\nSo common is this construction in Latin, that often the verb 'he said' is simply omitted if it is clear from the context, the accusative and infinitive alone making it clear that the statement is reported:\n\nNot every subordinate clause which starts with the conjunction 'that' in English is translated with an accusative and infinitive. In some contexts \"ut\" with the subjunctive is required, for example after a verb of happening:\n\nIn other circumstances a clause with \"quod\" 'the fact that' is used with the indicative:\n\nThis type of clause with \"quod\" (which became \"que\" in modern French, Portuguese and Spanish and \"che\" in Italian) gradually took over from the Accusative and infinitive construction and became the usual way of expressing indirect speech in modern Romance languages which are descended from Latin.\n\nUnlike Greek, Latin is deficient in participles, having only three, as follows:\n\nThus, there is no passive present or future participle, and no active past participle. In deponent verbs, however, the Perfect participle is active in meaning, e.g. \"profectus\", 'having set out', \"conatus\" 'having tried'.\n\nThe verb \"sum\" 'I am' has no Present or Perfect participle, but only the Future participle \"futūrus\" 'going to be'.\n\nThe Romans themselves considered the gerundive (see below) also to be a participle, but most modern grammars treat it as a separate part of speech.\n\nParticiples have endings like those of adjectives, and occasionally they are used as though they were adjectives. If so, they refer to the state or condition that a thing or person is in:\n\n\nMore frequently, however, a participle is more like a verb, and if one action follows another, it can often replace the first of two verbs in a sentence:\n\nLiterally, 'Caesar with his writing instrument (\"graphiō\") stabbed the arm (\"bracchium\"), which had been grabbed, for Casca' (\"Cascae\" here is probably Dative of the Person Affected.)\n\nParticiples can frequently be translated into English using a clause with 'when':\n\n\n\n'-ing' and 'who' are other possible translations:\n\n\nApart from 'when' and 'who', other translations are possible, such as 'if', 'since', or 'although':\n\nA participle phrase can also stand for a noun clause, as in the following example:\n\nNormally a Present participle represents an action which is simultaneous with the main event ('he came running'), and a Perfect participle represents one which has already happened ('after drawing his sword'). In the following example, however, the Perfect participle represents the result following the main action:\n\nParticiples are much commoner in Latin than in English. Sometimes multiple participles can be used in a single sentence:\n\nThe phrase \"strīctō gladiō\" (lit. 'with drawn sword') above is an example of a common idiom in which a noun and participle are put in the Ablative case to represent the circumstances of the main event. This idiom is referred to as an \"ablative absolute\" and is comparable to the Greek genitive absolute or the English nominative absolute. Other examples are:\n\nThe present participle can also be used in an ablative absolute:\n\nThe verb \"sum\" ('I am') has no participle, except in the compound forms \"absēns\" 'absent' and \"praesēns\" 'present'. To make an ablative absolute with 'to be', the words are put in the ablative, and the verb is simply omitted:\n\nThe gerundive is a verbal adjective ending in \"-ndus\" (\"-nda\" etc. if feminine). It is usually passive in meaning (although a few deponent verbs can form an active gerund, such as \"secundus\" 'following' from \"sequor\" 'I follow'). The usual meaning of the gerundive is that it is necessary for something to be done. Often the word 'must' is a suitable translation:\n\nIf a word is added to show by whom the action must be done, this word is put in the dative case (e.g. \"nōbīs\" 'for us').\n\nBecause it is passive in meaning, the gerundive is usually formed from transitive verbs. However, intransitive verbs such as \"eō\" 'I go' and \"persuādeō\" 'I persuade', which can be used passively in an impersonal construction, can also have an impersonal gerundive, ending in \"-um\":\n\nThe gerundive after \"ad\" can also be used to express purpose (a use which it shares with the gerund, see below):\n\nThe gerund is a verbal noun ending in \"-ndum\" (accusative), \"-ndī\" (genitive), or \"-ndō\" (dative or ablative). Although identical in form to a neuter gerundive, and overlapping the gerundive in some of its uses, it is possible that it has a different origin.\n\nGerunds are usually formed from intransitive verbs, and are mainly used in sentences such as the following where the meaning is 'by doing something', 'of doing something', or 'for the purpose of doing something'. A gerund is never used as the subject or direct object of a verb (the infinitive is used instead).\n\nOccasionally a gerund can be made from a transitive verb and can take a direct object:\n\nThey can also be formed from deponent verbs such as \"ingredior\" 'I enter':\n\nHowever, if the verb is transitive, a phrase made of noun + gerundive is often substituted for the gerund:\n\nThe supine is a rarely used part of the verb ending in \"-tum\" or (in some verbs) \"-sum\". Although it is identical with the accusative case of verbal nouns such as \"adventus\" 'arrival', \"mōtus\" 'movement', etc., it differs from them in that it is a verb as well as a noun, and can sometimes take a direct object.\n\nThe supine is normally used to express purpose, when combined with a verb of movement such as \"eō\" 'I go' or \"mittō\" 'I send':\n\nIn the following example it takes a direct object:\n\nThe accusative of the supine is also used to make the rare future passive infinitive \"captum īrī\" 'to be going to be captured', which can be used in indirect statements referring to the future (see above):\n\nThere is another form of the supine, an Ablative in \"-ū\", found with certain verbs only. But this cannot take an object. It is used in phrases such as \"mīrābile dictū\" 'amazing to say', \"facile factū\" 'easy to do':\n\n\n"}

He was born in a highly orthodox brahmin family though this father Surya Narayana was a follower of Brahmo Samaj. Surya Narayana named his yeldest son after a famous social reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy. He started going to school from the age of 5 years. Inspired by revolutionary spirit of his family, at the age of 10 Mahidhara abandoned his studies in 1919 and joined Indian Freedom Struggle. Though he quit his formal education, he acquired scholarship of multiple languages including Telugu, Sanskrit, Hindi, Bengali, English, Russian mostly through self study using dictionaries.\n\nIn 1925 he joined Congress party. In 1932 he joined Congress Social Party established by Jayaprakash Narayan. After two years, he became a strong advocate of communism. He teamed up with his brothers and started a publishing house called \"Viswa Sahitya Mala\" (Garland of world literature). From 1936 to 1984, this house published a series of books to educate people in the philosophy of communism and socialism. These works include 50 translations from English to Telugu in addition to some original works.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1944 he was jailed for participating in independence struggle along with leaders like Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy and Alluri Sathyam.

{"id": "43491060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43491060", "title": "Navajo grammar", "text": "Navajo grammar\n\nNavajo is a \"verb-heavy\" language — it has a great preponderance of verbs but relatively few nouns. In addition to verbs and nouns, Navajo has other elements such as pronouns, clitics of various functions, demonstratives, numerals, postpositions, adverbs, and conjunctions, among others. Harry Hoijer grouped all of the above into a word-class he called \"particles\" (i.e., Navajo would then have verbs, nouns, and particles). Navajo has no separate words that correspond to the \"adjectives\" in English grammar: verbs provide the adjectival functionality.\n\nThe key element in Navajo is the verb. Verbs are composed of an abstract stem to which inflectional or derivational prefixes are added. Every verb must have at least one prefix. The prefixes are affixed to the verb in a specified order.\n\nThe Navajo verb can be sectioned into different components. The verb \"stem\" is composed of an abstract \"root\" and an often fused suffix. The stem together with a \"classifier\" prefix (and sometimes other thematic prefixes) make up the verb \"theme\". The thematic prefixes are prefixes that are non-productive, have limited derivational function, and no longer have a clearly defined meaning. Examples of thematic prefixes, include the archaic yá- prefix, which only occurs on the verb stem -tééh/-tiʼ meaning \"to talk\" as in yáłtiʼ \"he's talking\". The \"theme\" is then combined with derivational prefixes that in turn make up the verb \"base\". Finally, inflectional prefixes (which Young & Morgan call \"paradigmatic prefixes\") are affixed to the \"base\" — producing a complete Navajo verb.\n\nThe prefixes that occur on a Navajo verb are added in specified more or less rigid order according to prefix type. This type of morphology is called a \"position class template\" (or \"slot-and-filler template\"). Below is a table of a recent proposal of the Navajo verb template (Young & Morgan 1987). Edward Sapir and Harry Hoijer were the first to propose an analysis of this type. A given verb does not have a prefix for every position. In fact, most Navajo verbs are not as complex as the template might suggest: the maximum number of prefixes is around eight.\n\nThe Navajo verb is composed of a verb stem and a set of prefixes. The prefixes can be divided into a conjunct prefix set and disjunct prefix set. The disjunct prefixes occur on the outer left edge of the verb. The conjunct prefixes occur after the disjunct prefixes, closer to the verb stem. Two types of prefixes can be distinguished by their different phonological behavior.\n\nThe prefix complex may be subdivided into 11 positions, with some of the positions having even further subdivisions:\n\nAlthough prefixes are generally found in a specific position, some prefixes change order by the process of metathesis. For example, prefix ʼa- (3i object pronoun) usually occurs before di-, as in\n\nHowever, when ʼa- occurs with the prefixes di- and ni-, the ʼa- metathesizes with di-, leading to an order of di- + ʼa- + ni-, as in\n\ninstead of the expected ʼadinisbąąs (ʼa-di-ni-sh-ł-bąąs) (note also that ʼa- is reduced to ʼ-).\n\nAlthough the verb template model of analysis has been traditionally used to describe the Navajo verb, other analyses have been proposed by Athabascanists.\n\nNavajo verbs have pronominal (i.e. pronoun) prefixes that mark both subjects and objects. The prefixes can vary in certain modes, particularly the perfective mode (See Mode and Aspect section below for a discussion of modes). The prefixes are inflected according to person and number. The basic subject prefixes (and their abbreviations as used by Young & Morgan) are listed in the table below:\n\nThe subject prefixes occur in two different positions. The first and second subject prefixes (-sh-, -Vd-, ni-, -oh-) occur in position 8 directly before the classifier prefixes. The fourth, indefinite, and \"space\" subject prefixes (ji-, ʼa-, ha-~ho-) are known as \"deictic subject pronouns\" and occur in position 5. The third person subject is marked by the absence of a prefix, which is usually indicated with a zero prefix -Ø- in position 8. The object prefixes can occur in position 4 as direct objects, in position 1a as \"null postpositions\", or in position 0 as the object of postpositions that have been incorporated into the verb complex.\n\nThe fourth person subject prefix ji- is a kind of obviative third person. It refers primarily to persons or personified animals (unlike the regular third person). It has a number of uses including:\n\nWhen used as an impersonal, it may be translated into English as \"one\" as in béésh bee njinéego hálaʼ da jiigish \"one can cut one's hand playing with knives\". The \"space\" prefix can be translated as \"area, place, space, impersonal it\" as in halgai \"the area/place is white\" and nahałtin \"it is raining\". The prefix has two forms: ha- and ho- with ho- having derived forms such as hw- and hwi-.\n\nAn example paradigm for \"to freeze\" (imperfective mode) showing the subject prefixes:\n\nThe \"classifiers\" are prefixes of position 9 (the closest to the verb stem) that affect the transitivity of the verb, in that they are valence and voice markers. Calling them \"classifiers\" is a misnomer, however, as they do not classify anything and are not related to the classificatory verb stems (which actually do classify nouns, see classificatory verbs below). There are four classifiers: -Ø-, -ł-, -d-, -l-. The -Ø- classifier is the absence of a prefix, which is usually indicated by a null morpheme.\n\nThe -ł- classifier is a causative-transitivizing prefix of active verbs. It often can transitivize an intransitive -Ø- verb: yibéézh \"it's boiling\" (yi-Ø-béézh), yiłbéézh \"he's boiling it (yi-ł-béézh); naʼniyęęsh \"somethings flows about in a meandering fashion\" (naʼni-Ø-yęęsh), naʼniłhęęsh \"he's making it flow about in a meandering fashion\" (naʼni-ł-yęęsh).\n\nThe -d- classifier occurs in most passive, mediopassive, reflexive, and reciprocal verbs that are derived from verbs with a -Ø- classifier: yizéés \"he's singeing it\" (yi-Ø-zéés), yidéés \"it's being singed\" (yi-d-zéés).\n\nThe -l- occurs in most passive, mediopassive, reflexive, and reciprocal verbs that are derived from verbs with a -ł- classifier: néíłtsááh \"he's drying it\" (ná-yi-ł-tsááh), náltsááh it's being dried\" (ná-l-tsááh).\n\nSome verbs can occur with all four classifier prefixes:\n\n\nIn other verbs, the classifiers do not mark transitivity and are considered thematic prefixes that simply are required to occur with certain verb stems.\n\nNavajo has a large number of aspectual, modal, and tense distinctions that are indicated by verb stem alternations (involving vowel and tonal ablaut and suffixation) often in combination with a range of prefixes. These are divided into seven \"modes\" and approximately twelve aspects and ten subaspects. (Although the term \"mode\" is traditionally used, most of the distinctions provided by the modes are in fact aspectual.) Each Navajo verb generally can occur in a number of mode and aspect category combinations.\n\nNavajo has the following verb modes:\n\n\nThe modes above have five distinct verb stem forms. For example, the verb meaning \"to play, tease\" has the following five stem forms for the seven modes:\n\nThe progressive and future modes share the same stem form as do the usitative and iterative modes. The optative mode usually has the same verb stem as the imperfective mode, although for some verbs the stem forms differ (in the example \"to play, tease\" above, the imperfective and the optative stems are the same).\n\nThe imperfective indicates an event/action that has begun but remains incomplete. Although this mode does not refer to tense, it is usually translated into English as a present tense form: yishááh \"I'm (in the act of) going/coming\", yishą́ \"I'm (in the act of) eating (something)\". With the additional of adverbials, the imperfective can be used for events/actions in the past, present, or future. The mode is used in the second person for immediate imperatives. The imperfective mode has a distinct imperfective stem form and four different mode-aspect prefix paradigms: (1) with a ni- terminative prefix in position 7 as in nishááh \"I'm in the act of arriving\", (2) with a si- stative prefix in position 7 as in shishʼaah \"I'm in the act of placing a SRO\" in dah shishʼaah \"I'm in the act of placing a SRO up\" (\"dah\" \"up\"), (3) with no prefix in position 7, usually identified as a Ø- prefix, as in yishcha \"I'm crying\", (4) with either a yi- transitional or yi- semelfactive prefix in position 6 (and no prefix in position 7).\n\nThe perfective indicates an event/action that has been completed and usually corresponds to English past tense: yíyáʼ \"I went/came/arrived\", yíyą́ą́ʼ \"I ate (something)\". However, since the perfective mode is not a tense, it can be used to refer non-past actions, such as the future (where it may be translated as English \"will have\" + ). The perfective mode has a distinct perfective stem form and four different prefix paradigms: (1) with a yí- perfective prefix with a high tone in position 7 as in yíchʼid \"I scratched it\", (2) with a ní- terminative prefix with a high tone in position 7 as in níyá \"I arrived\", (3) with a sí- stative prefix with high tone in position 7 as in sélį́į́ʼ \"I roasted it\", (4) with a yi- transitional prefix in position 6 (and Ø- in position 7) as in yiizįʼ \"I stood up\".\n\nThe progressive indicates an incomplete event/action that is ongoing without reference to the beginning or end of the event/action. This mode may be translated into English as + -ing + \"along\": yishááł \"I'm going/walking along\", yishtééł \"I'm carrying it along\". The future mode is primarily a future tense — indicating a prospective event/action: deeshááł \"I'll go/come\", deeshį́į́ł \"I'll eat (something)\". The progressive mode has a yi- progressive prefix (in position 7), the future has a di- inceptive prefix (in position 6) and the yi- progressive prefix.\n\nThe usitative indicates a repetitive event/action that takes place customarily: yishááh \"I usually go\", yishdlį́į́h \"I always drink (something)\". The iterative is a frequentative indicating a recurrent event/action that takes place repeatedly and customarily: chʼínáshdááh \"repeatedly go out\" as in ahbínígo tłʼóóʼgóó chʼínáshdááh \"I always (repeatedly) go outdoors in the morning\" (\"ahbínígo\" \"in the morning\", \"tłʼóóʼgóó\" \"outdoors\"), náshdlį́į́h \"drink (something) repeatedly\" as in nínádiishʼnahgo gohwééh náshdlį́į́h \"I drink coffee when I get up\" (\"nínádiishʼnahgo\" \"when I get up\", \"gohwééh\" \"coffee\"). The iterative is distinguished from the usitative by a ná- repetitive prefix (in position 2) and also sometimes by a -d- or -ł- classifier prefix (in position 9).\n\nThe optative indicates a positive or negative desire or wish. The mode is used with the addition of adverbial particles that follow the verb, such as laanaa and lágo: nahółtą́ą́ʼ laanaa \"I wish it would rain\", nahółtą́ą́ʼ lágo \"I hope it doesn't rain\". With punctual verbs, the optative mode can be used to form a negative imperative: shinóółʼį́į́ʼ (lágo) \"don't look at me!\". In certain adverbial frames, the optative indicates positive or negative potential.\n\nThe Primary aspects:\n\n\nThe subaspects:\n\n\nNavajo modes co-occur with various aspects. For example, the verb \"rain falls\" can occur in the perfective mode with the momentaneous and distributive aspects: -tsąąʼ (perfective momentaneous), -tsįʼ (perfective distributive). As with the modes, different aspects have different stem forms even when in the same mode, as seen with the previous \"rain falls\" perfective stems. Thus, a given verb has a set of stem forms that can be classified into both a mode and an aspect category. Verb stem paradigms of mode and aspect are given below for two different verbs:\n\nAs can be seen above, some aspect and mode combinations do not occur depending mostly upon the semantics of the particular verb. Additionally, some aspects do not occur at all with a particular verb. The patterns of verb stem alternations are very complex although there is a significant amount of homophony. A particularly important investigation into this area of the Navajo verb is Hardy (1979).\n\nNavajo has verb stems that classify a particular object by its shape or other physical characteristics in addition to describing the movement or state of the object. Athabaskan linguistics identifies these as classificatory verb stems and usually identifies them with an acronym label. The eleven primary classificatory \"handling\" verb stems appear listed below (in the perfective mode):\n\nTo compare with English, Navajo has no single verb that corresponds to the English word \"give\". To say the equivalent of \"Give me some hay!\", the Navajo verb níłjool (NCM) must be used, while for \"Give me a cigarette!\" the verb nítįįh (SSO) must be used. The English verb \"give\" is expressed by eleven different verbs in Navajo, depending on the characteristics of the given object.\n\nIn addition to defining the physical properties of the object, primary classificatory verb stems also can distinguish between the manner of movement of the object. The stems may then be grouped into three different categories:\n\n\n\"Handling\" includes actions such as carrying, lowering, and taking. \"Propelling\" includes tossing, dropping, and throwing. \"Free flight\" includes falling, and flying through space.\n\nUsing an example for the SRO category, Navajo has\n\n\nLike most Athabaskan languages, Southern Athabaskan languages show various levels of animacy in its grammar, with certain nouns taking specific verb forms according to their rank in this animacy hierarchy. For instance, Navajo nouns can be ranked by animacy on a continuum from most animate (a human or lightning) to least animate (an abstraction) (Young & Morgan 1987: 65-66):\n\n\"humans/lightning → infants/big animals → midsize animals → small animals → insects → natural forces → inanimate objects/plants → abstractions\"\n\nGenerally, the most animate noun in a sentence must occur first while the noun with lesser animacy occurs second. If both nouns are equal in animacy, then either noun can occur in the first position. So, both example sentences (1) and (2) are correct. The yi- prefix on the verb indicates that the 1st noun is the subject and bi- indicates that the 2nd noun is the subject.\n\nBut example sentence (3) sounds wrong to most Navajo speakers because the less animate noun occurs before the more animate noun:\n\nTo express this idea requires that the more animate noun occur first, as in sentence (4):\n\nNote that although sentence (4) is translated into English with a passive verb, in Navajo it is not passive. Passive verbs are formed by certain \"classifier\" prefixes (i.e., transitivity prefixes) that occur directly before the verb stem in position 9. The \"yi-/bi-\" prefixes do not mark sentences as active or passive, but as direct or inverse.\n\nMany concepts expressed using nouns in other languages appear as verbs in Navajo. The majority of true nouns are not inflected for number, and there is no case marking. Noun phrases are often not needed to form grammatical sentences due to the informational content of the verb.\n\nThere are two main types of nouns in Navajo:\n\n\nThe simple nouns can be distinguished by their ability to be inflected with a possessive prefix, as in\n\nDeverbal nouns are verbs (or verb phrases) that have been nominalized with a nominalizing enclitic or converted into a noun through zero derivation (that is, verbs that are used syntactically as nouns without an added nominalizer). An example of a nominalized verb is ' \"clock\", which is derived from the verb ' \"it is moved slowly in a circle\" and the enclitic nominalizer '. Another example is the deverbal noun ' \"singer\" (from verb ' \"he sings\" + nominalizing enclitic '). Converted deverbal nouns include ' \"exit, doorway\" and ' \"Phoenix, Arizona\" — when used as verbs ' may be translated into English as \"something has a path horizontally out\" and ' as \"place/space is hot\". Deverbal nouns can potentially be long and complex, such as\n\nwhich is composed of\n\n\nPossession in Navajo is expressed with personal pronoun prefixes:\n\nMost of the time, these prefixes take a low tone, but in some nouns and postpositions, the final syllable of the prefix takes a high tone, such as shílaʼ \"my hand,\" nihílaʼ \"our/your hand.\"\n\nThe prefixes are also used when the possessor noun in a possessive phrase is a noun, as in Jáan bimá \"lit.\" \"John his-mother,\" \"i.e.,\" \"John's mother.\"\n\nNavajo marks inalienable possession for certain nouns — relatives, body parts, homes and dens. These nouns can only appear with a possessive prefix, as in shimá \"my mother.\" If one wishes to speak of \"mothers\" in general, the 3rd person indefinite prefix ʼa- \"someone's\" is used, amá.\n\nNavajo uses a number of postpositions where Indo-European languages tend to favor prepositions; thus, all spatial and most other relations such as \"under\", \"on\", or \"above\" are expressed by using the possessive prefix in combination with a postposition. All postpositions are inalienable, meaning that a prefix or fusion with a true noun is mandatory.\n\nExamples include \"biyaa\" (under it), \"bikááʼ\" (on it), and \"bitah\" (among it). These can be combined with all prefixes to construct forms such as \"shiyaa\" (under me). Occasionally, postpositions are fused with true nouns to form a single word, such as Dinétah.\n\nNavajo uses a decimal (base-10) numeral system. There are unique words for the cardinal numbers 1-10. The numerals 11-19 are formed by adding an additive \"plus 10\" suffix ' to the base numerals 1-9. The numerals 20-100 are formed by adding a multiplicative \"times 10\" suffix ' to the base numerals 2-10.\n\nIn the compound numerals, the combining forms of the base numerals have irregular vowel and consonants changes. The numeral \"1\" has three forms:\n\n\nThe combining form ' is used in the compound ' \"11\". The numeral ' loses the final ' consonant while the final vowel in ' is shortened when the ' \"+10\" suffix is added. The suffix loses its initial ' becoming ' when added to ' \"5\". Several changes occur when the ' suffix is added involving a loss of the final consonant or a reduction in vowel length:\n\nFor the cardinal numerals higher than 20 between the multiples of 10 (i.e., 21-29, 31-39, 41-49, etc.), there are two types of formations. The numerals 21-29 and 41-49 are formed by suffixing the ones digit to the tens digit, as in ' \"22\" ( ← ' \"20\" + ' \"2\") and ' \"41\" ( ← ' \"40\" + ' \"1\"). Here the ' suffix appears in the combining form '. The combining form \"1\" is used as well:\n\nThe other numerals are formed by placing dóó baʼąą \"and in addition to it\" between the tens digit and the ones digit, as in tádiin dóó baʼąą tʼááłáʼí \"thirty-one\" and ashdladiin dóó baʼąą tʼááʼ \"fifty-three\". The numerals 41-49 may also be formed in this manner: \"forty-two dízdiin dóó baʼąą naaki or dízdįįnaaki.\n\nThe cardinal numerals 100-900 are formed by adding the multiplicative enclitic =di to the base numerals 1-9 and adding the word for \"hundred\" neeznádiin, as in tʼááłáhádí neeznádiin \"one hundred\", naakidi neeznádiin \"two hundred\", táadi neeznádiin \"three hundred\".\n\nThe base numerals with a high tone in the last syllable change to a falling tone before =di.\n\nFor the thousands, the word mííl (from Spanish \"mil\") is used in conjunction with =di: tʼááłáhádí mííl \"one thousand\", naakidi mííl \"two thousand\", etc. The word for \"million\" is formed by adding the stem -tsoh \"big\" to mííl: mííltsoh \"million\" as in tʼááłáhádí mííltsoh \"one million\", naakidi mííltsoh \"two million\", etc.\n\n"}

This practice may also involve stimulating the male genitalia.\n\nThe neologism \"pegging\" was popularized when it became the winning entry in a contest in Dan Savage's \"Savage Love\" sex advice column, held after an observation was made that there was no common name or dictionary definition for the act in the English language.\n\nIn terms of physical pleasure, a woman's genitals may get direct stimulation from the base of the dildo, or in the case of a double-ended dildo, from vaginal (or internal) penetration. A woman can use a secondary vibrator, between the dildo and her genitals, to get pleasure from pegging. Men may find stimulation of the anus, rectum, and especially the prostate, pleasurable. During anal sex, male pleasure can be particularly derived from the prostate, which can lead to an orgasm and ejaculation. Some men enjoy masturbating (or being manually stimulated) during pegging.\nTriple-ended dildos provide both vaginal and anal stimulation of the female partner.\n\nAdvice columnist Dan Savage wrote that he believes all men should try pegging at least once, as it may introduce them to a new enjoyable sexual activity and illuminate them to the receiver's perspective in sex.\n\nA few instructional movies and books have emerged in recent years, including \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" (1998), Based on a series of lectures and workshops by Robert Lawrence and Carol Queen and co-produced by Fatale Media, Inc. The movie was created and directed by Shar Rednour and Jackie Strano, SIR Video Movies co-founders. \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" originally inspired Dan Savage to call the act \"BOBing\" but his readers subsequently voted on the winning term, \"pegging\".\n\nAmerican pornographic film director and sex educator Tristan Taormino released an instructional pegging movie in 2009 by Vivid Entertainment Studio, \"Tristan Taormino's Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men\", featuring a detailed explanation about male anal pleasure and strap-on dildo sex. In it, she teaches a workshop with instructions and skills for safe and pleasurable female on male anal sex. There are three scenes, in which pairs of pornographic actors explore different sexual devices and positions for pegging.\n\nAs an author of numerous sex guides and informational books on various sexual taboos, Violet Blue wrote and released \"The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Strap-On Sex\" in 2007.\n\nSince 2010, the sex educator by the screen name of Ruby Ryder has been running a blog and podcast entitled \"Pegging Paradise\". As of September 2017, the podcast has over 166 episodes. She also runs the instructional site \"Pegging: 101\" which is especially targeting those interested in pegging with no interests in the association with BDSM. \n\nThe first pegging scene in film (long before the term was coined) appears to have been in the 1970 film \"Myra Breckinridge\", based on the novel of the same name by Gore Vidal, although it was not explicit. The first explicit pegging scene is believed to have been in the 1976 pornographic film \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\".\n\nFemale-to-male strap-on pornography became a popular subgenre in the early 21st century, with a number of studios producing dedicated series about it. Pegging films include \"Strap It On\", \"Babes Ballin Boys\", \"Strap Attack\", \"Strap-on Chicks\", \"Boss Bitches\", various films produced by LEDA Studios, as well as San Francisco-based BDSM themed website \"Men In Pain\".\n\nFemale porn stars who expressed their pleasure in pegging their male partners include Taylor Wane, Debi Diamond, Brittany Andrews, and Monique Covét. When questioned about her particular kink, Covét replied, \"If we women have to take it from behind, then why not a man?\"\n\nWhile not necessarily referred to as \"pegging,\" the following popular culture works make reference at least to the concept.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

The term \"language\" is frequently used as a synonym for a sign-system. However, the term \"sign-system\" is preferable to the term \"language\" for a number of reasons. First, the use of the term \"language\" tends to carry with it connotations of human language, particularly human spoken language. Human spoken language is only one example of a sign-system; albeit probably one of the most complex sign-systems known.\n\nFor example, in traditional forms of face-to-face communication, humans communicate through non-verbal as well as verbal sign-systems; colloquially, this can be referred to as body language. Hence, humans communicate a great deal by way of facial movements and other forms of bodily expression. Such expressions are also signs and an organised collection of such signs would be considered a sign system. Second, the same concept of a sign-system can be used in considering a vast range of communication forms such as animal communication and man-machine communication. Examination of simpler forms of such systems of signs within non-human communication can help to illuminate some of the essence of communication and in particular can help to provide tentative answers to the question of the nature and function of communication.\n\n"}

She was the sister of famed Ottoman Armenian politician Hovhannes Vahanian.\n\nDussap was born as Srpouhi Vahanian in the Ortakoy district of Constantinople to a prosperous upper-class Armenian Catholic family. At the time, wealthy families regularly imitated the trends and customs of Western European, primarily French society. The young Dussap, being educated in Western European institutions, showed little interest in the Armenian language. However, after being tutored by revered Armenian poet Mkrtich Beshiktashlian, Dussap began to show a deep affection for the language as well as her heritage. Her first creative writing attempts were written in classical Armenian.\nDussap was married to a French musician, Paul Dussap, with whom she ran a European style salon where the city's prominent intellectuals, liberals, writers and activists would gather to discuss social and political issues, literature and poetry. She was active in philanthropic and charitable organizations that furthered the support and education of women. Dussap's oeuvre reflects nineteenth century European trends. She wrote mainly in the Romantic style.\n\nDussap had two children, Dorine and Edgar. Dorine died in 1891, after which Dussap ceased writing for publication. Dussap died in 1901.\n\nDussap is the first Armenian writer who published works that today would be called feminist. The earliest of these were a series of essays on the status of women's education and employment. In 1883, she published the first novel by an Armenian woman, \"Mayda\", which treated the theme of women's unequal status. Dussap's concern with female subordination, inferior education, and lack of financial independence was developed in the later novels \"Siranush\" (1884) and \"Araksia, or The Governess,\" (1887). \nShe was very much concerned about the situation of the female peasantry of the Ottoman Empire, attacking the traditional patriarchal structures behind their ignorance, and the male oppression that led to forced marriages in the countryside. She further noted that even in the more cultured and cosmopolitan Constantinople, women \"were still deprived of their freedom and dominated by men.\" Dussap was certain that society would not be able to advance and progress without the emancipation of women. For these liberal ideas, she faced resentment from some prominent Armenian intellectuals, such as Krikor Zohrab, but was esteemed by progressivists.\n\nDussap is regarded today as a pioneer in addressing female inequality and the need for female education. She was an inspiration to other Armenian women writers and journalists such as Zabel Yesayan, who recalled reading her in her youth, \"We used to read Madame Dussap's books together, and in the work of that feminist author, we tried to find solutions to the problems we faced.\" Later, she and her friends visited Dussap: \"She immediately started asking questions and spoke to us with warmth and encouragement...Hearing that I hoped to become a writer, Madame Dussap tried to warn me. She said that, for women, the world of literature was full of many more thorns than laurels. She told me that in our day and age, a woman who wanted to carve out a place for herself in society was still not tolderated. To overcome all of these obstacles, I needed to exceed mediocrity. ..She made a deep impression on us...We both agreed that in order to exceed mediocrity, we needed to go to Europe to continue our education.\" \n"}

{"id": "1735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1735", "title": "Ānanda", "text": "Ānanda\n\nĀnanda (5th4th centuries BCE) was the primary attendant of the Buddha and one of his ten principal disciples. Among the Buddha's many disciples, Ānanda stood out for having the best memory. Most of the texts of the early Buddhist \"Sutta-Piṭaka\" (Pāli; ) are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the First Buddhist Council. For that reason, he is known as the Treasurer of the Dhamma, with \"Dhamma\" () referring to the Buddha's teaching. In Early Buddhist Texts, Ānanda is the first cousin of the Buddha. Although the early texts do not agree on many parts of Ananda's early life, they do agree that Ānanda is ordained as a monk and that Puṇṇa Mantāniputta () becomes his teacher. Twenty years in the Buddha's ministry, Ānanda becomes the attendant of the Buddha, when the Buddha selects him for this task. Ānanda performs his duties with great devotion and care, and acts as an intermediary between the Buddha and the laypeople, as well as the \"saṅgha\" (). He accompanies the Buddha for the rest of his life, acting not only as an assistant, but also a secretary and a mouthpiece.\n\nScholars are skeptical about the historicity of many events in Ānanda's life, especially the First Council, and consensus about this has yet to be established. A traditional account can be drawn from early texts, commentaries, and post-canonical chronicles. Ānanda has an important role in establishing the order of \"bhikkhunīs\" (), when he requests the Buddha on behalf of the latter's foster-mother Mahāpajāpati Gotamī () to allow her to be ordained. Ānanda also accompanies the Buddha in the last year of his life, and therefore is witness to many tenets and principles that the Buddha conveys before his death, including the well-known principle that the Buddhist community should take his teaching and discipline as their refuge, and that he will not appoint a new leader. The final period of the Buddha's life also shows that Ānanda is very much attached to the Buddha's person, and he sees the Buddha's passing with great sorrow.\n\nShortly after the Buddha's death, the First Council is convened, and Ānanda manages to attain enlightenment just before the council starts, which is a requirement. He has a historical role during the council as the living memory of the Buddha, reciting many of the Buddha's discourses and checking them for accuracy. During the same council, however, he is chastised by Mahākassapa () and the rest of the \"saṅgha\" for allowing women to be ordained and failing to understand or respect the Buddha at several crucial moments. Ānanda continues to teach until the end of his life, passing on his spiritual heritage to his pupils Sāṇavāsī () and Majjhantika (), among others, who later assume a leading role in the Second and Third Councils. Ānanda dies 20 years after the Buddha, and \"stūpas\" (momuments) are erected at the river where he dies.\n\nĀnanda is one of the most loved figures in Buddhism. Ānanda is known for his memory, erudition and compassion, and is often praised by the Buddha for these matters. He functions as a foil to the Buddha, however, in that he still has worldly attachments and is not yet enlightened, as opposed to the Buddha. In the Sanskrit textual traditions, Ānanda is considered the patriarch of the Dhamma, who stands in a spiritual lineage, receiving the teaching from Mahākassapa and passing them on to his own pupils. Ānanda has been honored by \"bhikkhunīs\" since early medieval times for his merits in establishing the nun's order. In recent times, the composer Richard Wagner and Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore were inspired by stories about Ānanda in their work.\n\nThe word \"ānanda\" means 'bliss, joy' in Pāli and in Sanskrit. Pāli Commentaries explain that when Ānanda is born, his relatives are joyous about this, and he therefore is named that way. Texts from the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, however, state that since Ānanda is born on the day of the Buddha's enlightenment, there is great rejoicing in the cityhence the name.\n\nAccording to the texts, in a previous life, Ānanda makes an aspiration to become a Buddha's attendant. He makes this aspiration in the time of a previous Buddha called Padumuttara, many eons (, ) before the present time. He meets the attendant of Padumuttara Buddha and aspires to be like him in a future life. After having done many good deeds, he makes his resolution known to the Padumuttara Buddha, who confirms that his wish will come true in a future life. After having been born and reborn through many lifetimes, and doing many good deeds, he is born as Ānanda in the present lifetime.\n\nĀnanda is born in the same time period as the Buddha (formerly Prince Siddhattha), which scholars place at 5th4th centuries BCE. Tradition says that Ānanda is the first cousin of the Buddha, his father being the brother of Suddhodana (), the Buddha's father. In the Pāli and Mūlasarvāstivāda textual traditions, his father is Amitodana (), but the \"Mahāvastu\" states that his father is Śuklodanaboth are brothers of Suddhodana. The Mahāvastu also mentions that Ānanda's mother's name is Mṛgī (Sanskrit; 'little deer'; Pāli is unknown). The Pāli tradition has it that Ānanda is born on the same day as Prince Siddhatta (), but texts from the Mūlasarvāstivāda and subsequent Mahāyāna traditions state Ānanda is born at the same time the Buddha attains enlightenment (when Prince Siddhattha is 29 years old), and is therefore much younger than the Buddha. The latter tradition is corroborated by several instances in the Early Buddhist Texts, in which Ānanda appears younger than the Buddha, such as the passage in which the Buddha explains to Ānanda how old age is affecting him in body and mind. It is also corroborated by a verse in the Pāli text called \"Theragāthā\", in which Ānanda states he was a \"learner\" for twenty-five years, after which he attended the Buddha for another twenty-five years.\n\nFollowing the Pāli, Mahīśasaka and Dharmaguptaka textual traditions, Ānanda becomes a monk in the second year of the Buddha's ministry, during the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu (). He is ordained by the Buddha himself, together with many other princes of the Buddha's clan (, ), in the mango grove called Anupiya, part of Malla territory. According to a text from the Mahāsaṅghika tradition, King Suddhodana wants the Buddha to have more followers of the \"khattiya\" caste (), and less from the brahmin (priest) caste. He therefore orders that any \"khattiya\" who has a brother must follow the Buddha as a monk, or have his brother do so. Ānanda uses this opportunity with great joy, and asks his brother Devadatta to stay at home, so that he can leave it for the monkhood. The later timeline from the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts and the Pāli \"Theragāthā\", however, have Ānanda ordain much later, about twenty-five years before the Buddha's deathin other words, twenty years in the Buddha's ministry. Some Sanskrit sources have him ordain even later. The Mūladarvāstivāda texts on monastic discipline (Pāli and ) relate that soothsayers predict Ānanda will be the Buddha's attendant. In order to prevent Ānanda from leaving the palace to ordain, his father brings him to Vesālī () during the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu, but the Buddha meets and teaches Ānanda later. When Ānanda does become ordained, his father has him ordain in Kapilavatthu in the Nigrodhārāma monastery () with much ceremony, Ānanda's preceptor (; ) being a certain Daśabāla Kāśyapa. The Mahāvastu relates that Mṛgī is initially opposed to Ānanda joining the holy life, because his brother Devadatta has already ordained and left the palace. Ānanda responds to his mother's resistance by moving to Videha () and lives there, taking a vow of silence. This leads him to gain the epithet Videhamuni (), meaning 'the silent wise one from Videha'.\n\nAccording to the Pāli tradition, Ānanda's first teachers are Belaṭṭhasīsa and Puṇṇa Mantāniputta. It is Puṇṇa's teaching that leads Ānanda to attain the stage of \"sotāpanna\" (), an attainment preceding that of enlightenment. Ānanda later expresses his debt to Puṇṇa. Another important figure in the life of Ānanda is Sāriputta (), one of the Buddha's main disciples. Sāriputta often teaches Ānanda about the finer points of Buddhist doctrine; they are in the habit of sharing things with one another, and their relationship is described as a good friendship. In some Mūlasarvāstivāda texts, an attendant of Ānanda is also mentioned who helps encourage Ānanda when he is banned from the First Buddhist Council. He is a \"Vajjiputta\" (), i.e. someone who originates from the Vajji confederacy. According to later texts, an enlightened monk called Vajjiputta () has an important role in Ānanda's life. He listens to a teaching of Ānanda and realizes that Ānanda is not enlightened yet. Vajjiputta encourages Ānanda to talk less to laypeople and to deepen his meditation practice by retreating in the forest, an advice that very much affects Ānanda.\n\nIn the first twenty years of the Buddha's ministry, the Buddha has several personal attendants. However, after these twenty years, when the Buddha is aged 55, the Buddha announces that he has need for a permanent attendant. The Buddha has been growing older, and his previous attendants did not do their job very well. Initially, several of the Buddha's foremost disciples respond to his request, but the Buddha does not accept them. All the while Ānanda remains quiet. When he is asked why, he says that the Buddha will know best who to choose, upon which the Buddha responds by choosing Ānanda. Ānanda agrees to take on the position, on the condition that he does not receive any material benefits from the Buddha. Accepting such benefits would open him up to criticism that he chose the position because of ulterior motives. He also requests that the Buddha allows him to accept invitations on his behalf, allows him to ask questions about his doctrine, and repeats any teaching that has been taught in Ānanda's absence. These requests would help people trust Ānanda and show that the Buddha was sympathetic to his attendant. Furthermore, Ānanda considers these the real advantages of being an attendant, which is why he requests them.\n\nThe Buddha agrees to Ānanda's conditions, and Ānanda becomes the Buddha's attendant, accompanying the Buddha on most of his wanderings. Ānanda takes care of the Buddha's daily practical needs, by doing things such as bringing water and cleaning the Buddha's dwelling place. He is depicted as observant and devoted, even guarding the Buddha's dwelling place at night. Ānanda takes the part of interlocutor in many of the recorded dialogues. He attends the Buddha for a total of 25 years, a duty which entails much work. His relationship with the Buddha is depicted as warm and trusting: when the Buddha grows ill, Ānanda has a sympathetic illness; when the Buddha grows older, Ānanda keeps taking care of him with devotion.\n\nĀnanda sometimes literally risks his life for his master. At one time, the rebellious monk Devadatta tries to kill the Buddha by having a drunk and wild elephant released in the Buddha's presence. Ānanda steps in front of the Buddha to protect him. When the Buddha tells him to move, he refuses, although normally he always obeys the Buddha. Through a supernatural accomplishment (; ) the Buddha then moves Ānanda aside and brings the elephant down, by touching it and speaking to it with loving-kindness.\n\nĀnanda often acts as an intermediary and secretary, passing on messages from the Buddha, informing the Buddha of news, invitations, or the needs of lay people, and advising lay people who want to provide gifts to the \"saṅgha\". At one time, Mahāpajāpatī, the Buddha's foster-mother, requests to offer robes for personal use for the Buddha. She says that even though she has raised the Buddha in his youth, she never gave anything in person to the young prince; she now wishes to do so. The Buddha initially insists that she give the robe to the community as a whole rather than to be attached to his person. However, Ānanda intercedes and mediates, arguing that the Buddha better accept the robe. Eventually the Buddha does, but not without pointing out to Ānanda that good deeds like giving should always be done for the sake of the action itself, not for the sake of the person.\n\nThe texts say that the Buddha sometimes asks Ānanda to substitute for him as teacher, and is often praised by the Buddha for his teachings. Ānanda is often given important teaching roles, such as regularly teaching Queen Mallikā, Queen Sāmāvatī, () and other people from the ruling class. Once Ānanda teaches a number of King Udena ()'s concubines. They are so impressed by Ānanda's teaching, that they give him five hundred robes, which Ānanda accepts. Having heard about this, King Udena criticizes Ānanda for being greedy; Ānanda responds by explaining how every single robe is carefully used, reused and recycled by the monastic community, prompting the king to offer another five hundred robes. Ānanda also has a role in the Buddha's visit to Vesālī. In this story, the Buddha teaches the well-known text \"Ratana Sutta\" to Ānanda, which Ānanda then recites in Vesālī, ridding the city from illness, drought and evil spirits in the process. Another well-known passage in which the Buddha teaches Ānanda is the passage about spiritual friendship (). In this passage, Ānanda states that spiritual friendship is half of the holy life; the Buddha corrects Ānanda, stating that such friendship is the entire holy life. In summary, Ānanda works as an assistant, intermediary and a mouthpiece, helping the Buddha in many ways, and learning his teachings in the process.\n\nĀnanda is attractive in appearance. A Pāli account relates that a \"bhikkhunī\" becomes enamored with Ānanda, and pretends to be ill to have Ānanda visit her. When she realizes the error of her ways, she confesses her mistakes to Ānanda. Other accounts relate that a low-caste woman called Prakṛti falls in love with Ānanda, and persuades her mother Mātaṅgī to use a black magic spell to enchant him. This succeeds, and Ānanda is lured into her house, but comes to his senses and calls upon the help of the Buddha. The Buddha then teaches Prakṛti to reflect on the repulsive qualities of the human body, and eventually Prakṛti is ordained as a \"bhikkhunī\", giving up her attachment for Ānanda. In an East Asian version of the story in the Śūraṃgamasūtra, the Buddha sends Mañjuśrī to help Ānanda, who uses recitation to counter the magic charm. The Buddha then continues to teach Ānanda and other listeners about the Buddha nature.\n\nIn the role of mediator between the Buddha and the lay communities, Ānanda sometimes makes suggestions to the Buddha for amendments in the monastic discipline. Most importantly, the early texts attribute the inclusion of women in the early \"saṅgha\" (monastic order) to Ānanda. Fifteen years after the Buddha's enlightenment, his foster mother Mahāpajāpatī comes to see him to ask him to be ordained as the first Buddhist \"bhikkhunī\". Initially, the Buddha refuses this. Five years later, Mahāpajāpatī comes to request the Buddha again, this time with a following of other Sākiya women, including the Buddha's former wife Yasodharā (). They have walked , look dirty, tired and depressed, and Ānanda feels pity for them. Ānanda therefore confirms with the Buddha whether women can become enlightened as well. Although the Buddha concedes this, he does not allow the Sākiya women to be ordained yet. Ānanda then discusses with the Buddha how Mahāpajāpatī took care of him during his childhood, after the death of his real mother. Ānanda also mentions that previous Buddhas have also ordained \"bhikkhunīs\". In the end, the Buddha allows the Sākiya women to be ordained, being the start of the \"bhikkhunī\" order. Ānanda has Mahāpajāpati ordained by her acceptance of a set of rules, set by the Buddha. These are known as the \"garudhamma\", and they describe the subordinate relation of the \"bhikkhunī\" community to that of the \"bhikkhus\" or monks. Asian religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma argues that the debt the Buddha had toward his foster-mother Mahāpajāpati may have been the main reason for his concessions with regard to the establishment of a \"bhikkhunī\" order.\n\nMany scholars interpret this account to mean that the Buddha is reluctant in allowing women to be ordained, and that Ānanda successfully persuaded the Buddha to change his mind. For example, Indologist and translator I.B. Horner wrote that \"this is the only instance of his being over-persuaded in argument\". However, some scholars interpret the Buddha's initial refusal rather as a test of resolve, following a widespread pattern in the Pāli Canon and in monastic procedure of repeating a request three times before final acceptance. Some also argue that the Buddha was believed by Buddhists to be omniscient, and therefore is unlikely to have been depicted as changing his mind. Other scholars argue that other passages in the texts indicate the Buddha intends all along to establish a \"bhikkhunī\" order. Regardless, during the acceptance of women into the monastic order, the Buddha tells Ānanda that the Buddha's dispensation will last shorter because of this reason. At the time, the Buddhist monastic order consisted of wandering celibate males, without many monastic institutions. Allowing women to join the Buddhist celibate life might have led to dissension, as well as temptation between the sexes. The \"garudhamma\", however, are meant to fix these problems, and prevent the dispensation from being curtailed.\n\nThere are some chronological discrepancies in the traditional account of the setting up of the \"bhikkhunī\" order. According to the Pāli and Mahīśasaka textual traditions, the \"bhikkhunī\" order is set up five years after the Buddha's enlightenment, but Ānanda only becomes attendant twenty years after the Buddha's enlightenment. Furthermore, Mahāpajāpati is the Buddha's foster mother, and must therefore be considerably older than him. However, after the \"bhikkhunī\" order is established, Mahāpajāpati still has many audiences with the Buddha, as reported in Pāli and Chinese Early Buddhist Texts. Because of this and other reasons, it could be inferred that establishment of the \"bhikkhunī\" order actually takes place \"early\" in the Buddha's ministry. If this is the case, Ānanda's role in establishing the order becomes less likely. Some scholars therefore interpret the names in the account, such as \"Ānanda\" and \"Mahāpajāpati\", as symbols, representing groups rather than specific individuals.\n\nAccording to the texts, Ānanda's role in founding the \"bhikkhunī\" order makes him popular with the \"bhikkhunī\" community. Ānanda often teaches \"bhikkhunīs\", often encourages women to ordain, and when he is criticized by the monk Mahākassapa, several \"bhikkhunīs\" try to defend him. According to Indologist Oskar von Hinüber, Ānanda's pro-\"bhikkhunī\" attitude may well be the reason why there is frequent discussion between Ānanda and Mahākassapa, eventually leading Mahākasapa to charge Ānanda with several offenses during the First Buddhist Council. Hinüber further argues that the establishment of the \"bhikkhunī\" order may have well been initiated by Ānanda after the Buddha's death, and the introduction of Mahāpajāpati as the person requesting to do so is merely a literary device to connect the female ordination with the Buddha through his foster mother. Hinüber concludes this based on several patterns in the early texts, including the apparent distance between the Buddha and the \"bhikkhunī\" order, and the frequent discussions and differences of opinion that take place between Ānanda and Mahākassapa. Some scholars have seen merits in von Hinüber's argument with regard to the pro- and anti-factions, but as of 2017, no definitive evidence has been found for the theory of establishment after the Buddha's death. Buddhist studies scholar Bhikkhu Anālayo has responded to most of Hinuber's arguments, writing: \"Besides requiring too many assumptions, this hypothesis conflicts with nearly 'all the evidence preserved in the texts together'\", arguing that it is monastic discipline that created a distance between the Buddha and the \"bhikkhunīs\", and even so, there are many places in the early texts where the Buddha does address \"bhikkhunīs\" directly.\n\nDespite his long association with and close proximity to the Buddha, the texts describe that Ānanda has not become enlightened yet. Because of that a fellow monk Udāyī () ridicules Ānanda for this. However, the Buddha reprimands Udāyī in response, adding that Ānanda will certainly be enlightened in this life.\n\nThe Pāli \"Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta\" relates the last year-long trip the Buddha takes with Ānanda from Rājagaha () to the small town of Kusināra () before the Buddha dies there. Before reaching Kusināra, the Buddha spends the retreat during the monsoon (, ) in Veḷugāma (), getting out of the Vesālī area which suffers from famine. Here the eighty-year old Buddha expresses his wish to speak to the \"saṅgha\" once more. The Buddha has grown seriously ill in Vesālī, much to the concern of some of his disciples. Ānanda understands that the Buddha wishes to leave final instructions before his death. The Buddha replies, however, that he has already taught everything needed, without withholding anything secret as a teacher with a \"closed fist\" would. He also impresses upon Ānanda that he does not think the \"saṅgha\" should be reliant too much on a leader, not even himself. He then continues with the well-known statement to take his teaching as a refuge, and oneself as a refuge, without relying on any other refuge, also after the Buddha is gone. Bareau argues that this is one of the most ancient parts of the text, found in slight variation in five early textual traditions:\n\nThe same text contains an account in which the Buddha, at numerous occasions, gives a hint that he could prolong his life to a full eon through a supernatural accomplishment, but this is a power that he must be to exercise. Ānanda is distracted, however, and does not take the hint. Later, Ānanda does make the request, but the Buddha replies that it is already too late, as he will die soon. Māra, the Buddhist personification of evil, has visited the Buddha, and the Buddha has decided to die after three months. When Ānanda hears this, he weeps. The Buddha consoles him, however, pointing out that Ānanda has been a great attendant, being sensitive to the needs of different people. If he is earnest in his efforts, he will attain enlightenment soon. He then points out to Ānanda that all conditioned things are impermanent: all people must die.\n\nIn the final days of the Buddha's life, the Buddha travels to Kusināra. The Buddha has Ānanda prepare a place for lying down between two sal trees, the same type of tree under which the mother of the Buddha gave birth. The Buddha then has Ānanda invite the Malla clan from Kusināra to pay their final respects. Having returned, Ānanda asks the Buddha what should be done with his body after his death, and he replies that it should be cremated, giving detailed instructions on how this should be done. Since the Buddha prohibits Ānanda from being involved himself, but rather has him instruct the Mallas to perform the rituals, these instructions have by many scholars been interpreted as a prohibition in Buddhism that monastics should not be involved in funerals or worship of \"stūpas\" (structures with relics). Buddhist studies scholar Gregory Schopen has pointed out, however, that this prohibition only holds for Ānanda, and only with regard to the Buddha's funeral ceremony. It has also been shown that the instructions on the funeral are quite late in origin, in both composition and insertion into the text, and are not found in parallel texts, apart from the \"Mahāparinibbāna Sutta\". Ānanda then continues by asking how devotees should honor the Buddha after his death. The Buddha responds by listing four important places in his life that people can pay their respects to, which later become the four main places of Buddhist pilgrimage. Before the Buddha dies, Ānanda recommends the Buddha to move to a more meaningful city instead, but the Buddha points out that the town was once a great capital. Ānanda then asks who will be next teacher after the Buddha is gone, but the Buddha replies that his teaching and discipline will be the teacher instead. This means that decisions should be made by reaching consensus within the \"saṅgha\", and more generally, that now the time has come for the Buddhist monastics and devotees to take the Buddhist texts as authority, instead of the Buddha and his eminent disciples.\n\nThe Buddha gives several instructions before his death, including a directive that his former charioteer Channa () be shunned by his fellow monks, to humble his pride. In his final moments, the Buddha asks if anyone has any questions he wishes to pose to him, as a final chance to allay any doubts. When no-one responds, Ānanda expresses joy that all of the Buddha's disciples present have attained a level beyond doubts about the Buddha's teaching. However, the Buddha points out that Ānanda speaks out of faith and not out of meditative insighta final reproach. He adds that, of all the five hundred monks that are surrounding him now, even the \"latest\" or \"most backward\" () has attained the initial stage of \"sotapanna\". Meant as an encouragement, the Buddha is referring to Ānanda. During the Buddha's \"final Nirvana\", Anuruddha is able to use his meditative powers to understand which stages the Buddha undergoes before he attains final Nirvana. However, Ānanda is unable to do so, indicating his lesser spiritual maturity. After the Buddha's death, Ānanda recites several verses, expressing a sense of urgency (), deeply moved by the events and their bearing: \"Terrible was the quaking, men's hair stood on end, / When the all-accomplished Buddha passed away.\"\n\nShortly after the council, Ānanda brings the message with regard to the Buddha's directive to Channa personally. Channa is humbled and changes his ways, attains enlightenment, and the penalty is withdrawn. Ānanda travels to Sāvatthī (), where he is met with a sad populace, who he consoles with teachings on impermanence. After that, Ānanda goes to the quarters of the Buddha and goes through the motions of the routine he formerly performed when the Buddha was still alive, such as preparing water and cleaning the quarters. He then salutes and talks to the quarters as though the Buddha was still there. The Pāli commentaries state that Ānanda does this out of devotion, but also because he is \"not yet free from the passions\".\n\nAccording to the texts, the First Buddhist Council is held in Rājagaha. In the first \"vassa\" after the Buddha has died, the presiding monk Mahākassapa () calls upon Ānanda to recite the discourses he has heard, as a representative on this council. There is a rule issued that only enlightened disciples (\"arahants\") are allowed to attend the council, to prevent mental afflictions from clouding the disciples' memories. Ānanda has, however, not attained enlightenment yet, in contrast with the rest of the council, consisting of 499 \"arahants\". Mahākassapa therefore does not allow Ānanda to attend yet. Although he knows that Ānanda's presence in the council is required, he does not want to be biased by allowing an exception to the rule. The Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition adds that Mahākassapa initially allows Ānanda to join as a sort of servant assisting during the council, but then is forced to remove him when the disciple Anuruddha sees that Ānanda is not yet enlightened.\n\nĀnanda feels humiliated, but is prompted to focus his efforts to reach enlightenment before the council starts. The Mūlasarvāstivāda texts add that he feels motivated when he remembers the Buddha's words to be his own refuge, and when he is consoled and advised by Anuruddha and Vajjiputta, the latter being his attendant. On the night before the event, he tries hard to attain enlightenment. After a while, Ānanda takes a break and decides to lie down for a rest. He then attains enlightenment right there, right then, halfway between sitting and lying down. Thus, Ānanda is known as the disciple who attained awakening \"in none of the four traditional poses\" (walking, standing, sitting, or lying down). The next morning, to prove his enlightenment, Ānanda performs a supernatural accomplishment by diving into the earth and appearing on his seat at the council (or, according to some sources, by flying through the air). Scholars such as Buddhologist André Bareau and religion scholar Ellison Banks Findly have been skeptical about many details in this account, including the number of participants on the council, and the account of Ānanda's enlightenment just before the council. Regardless, today, the story of Ānanda's struggle on the evening before the council is still told among Buddhists as a piece of advice in the practice of meditation: neither to give up, nor to interpret the practice too rigidly.\n\nThe First Council begins when Ānanda is consulted to recite the discourses and to determine which are authentic and which are not. Mahākassapa asks of each discourse that Ānanda lists where, when, and to whom it was given, and at the end of this, the assembly agrees that Ānanda's memories and recitations are correct, after which the discourse collection (, ) is considered finalized and closed. Ānanda therefore plays a crucial role in this council, and texts claim he remembers 84,000 teaching topics, among which 82,000 taught by the Buddha and another 2,000 taught by disciples. Many early Buddhist discourses start with the words \"Thus have I heard\" (, ), which according to most Buddhist traditions, are Ānanda's words, indicating that he, as the person reporting the text (), had first-hand experience and did not add anything to it. Thus, the discourses Ānanda remembers later become the collection of discourses of the Canon, and according to the Haimavāta, Dharmaguptaka and Sarvāstivāda textual traditions (and implicitly, post-canonical Pāli chronicles), the collection of Abhidhamma (\"Abhidhamma Piṭaka\") as well. Religious studies scholar Ronald Davidson notes, however, that this is not preceded by any account of Ānanda learning Abhidhamma. According to some later Mahāyāna accounts, Ānanda also assists in reciting Mahāyāna texts, held in a different place in Rājagaha, but in the same time period. The Pāli commentaries state that after the council, as the tasks for recitation and memorizing the texts are divided, Ānanda, and his pupils are given the task to remember the Digha Nikāya.\n\nDuring the same council, Ānanda is charged for an offense by members of the \"saṅgha\" for having enabled women to join the monastic order. Besides this, he is charged for having forgotten to request the Buddha to specify which offenses of monastic discipline could be disregarded; for having stepped on the Buddha's robe; for having allowed women to honor the Buddha's body after his death, which was naked, and during which his body was sullied by their tears; and for having failed to ask the Buddha to continue to live on. Ānanda does not acknowledge these as offenses, but he concedes to do a formal confession anyway, \"... in faith of the opinion of the venerable elder monks\"Ānanda wants to prevent disruption in the \"saṅgha\". With regard to having women ordained, Ānanda answers that he worked hard for that because Mahāpajāpati was the Buddha's foster-mother who had long provided for him. With regard to not requesting the Buddha to continue to live, many textual traditions have Ānanda respond by saying he was distracted by Māra, though one early Chinese text has Ānanda reply he did not request the Buddha to prolong his life, for fear that this would interfere with the next Buddha Maitreya's ministry.\n\nAccording to the Pāli tradition, the charges are laid after Ānanda has become enlightened and done all the recitations; but the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition has it that the charges are laid before Ānanda becomes enlightened and starts the recitations. In this version, when Ānanda hears that he is banned from the council, he objects that he has not done anything that goes against the teaching and discipline of the Buddha. Mahākassapa then lists seven charges to counter Ānanda's objection. The charges are similar to the five given in Pāli. Other textual traditions list slightly different charges, amounting to a combined total of eleven charges, some of which are only mentioned in one or two textual traditions. Considering that an enlightened disciple was seen to have overcome all faults, it seems more likely that the charges were laid before Ānanda's attainment than after.\n\nIndologists von Hinüber and Jean Przyluski argue that the account of Ānanda being charged with offenses during the council indicate tensions between competing early Buddhist schools, i.e. schools that emphasized the discourses (, ) and schools that emphasized monastic discipline. These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition: e.g. the Pāli and Mahīśāsaka textual traditions portray a Mahākassapa that is more critical of Ānanda than that the Sarvāstivāda tradition depicts them, reflecting a preference for discipline above discourse on the part of the former traditions, and a preference for discourse for the latter. Another example is the recitations during the First Council. The Pāli texts state that Upāli, the person who is responsible for the recitation of the monastic discipline, recites Ānanda does: again, monastic discipline above discourse. Analyzing six textual traditions of the \"Mahāparinibbāna Sutta\" extensively, Bareau distinguished two layers in the text, an older and a newer one, the former belonging to the compilers that emphasized discourse, the latter to the ones that emphasized discipline; the former emphasizing the figure of Ānanda, the latter Mahākassapa. He further argued that the passage on Māra obstructing the Buddha was inserted in the fourth century BCE, and that Ānanda was blamed for Māra's doing by inserting the passage of Ānanda's forgetfulness in the third century BCE. The passage in which the Buddha is ill and reminds Ānanda to be his own refuge, on the other hand, Bareau regarded as very ancient, pre-dating the passages blaming Māra and Ānanda. In conclusion, Bareau, Przyluski and Horner argued that the offenses Ānanda are charged with are a later interpolation. Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the \"Mahāparinibbāna Sutta\" and with Ānanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.\n\nTradition states that the First Council lasts for seven months. Scholars doubt, however, whether the entire canon was really recited during the First Council, because the early texts contain different accounts on important subjects such as meditation. It may be, though, that early versions were recited of what is now known as the \"Vinaya-piṭaka\" and \"Sutta-piṭaka\". Nevertheless, many scholars, from the late 19th century onward, have considered the historicity of the First Council improbable. Some scholars, such as orientalists Louis de La Vallée-Poussin and D.P. Minayeff, thought there must have been assemblies after the Buddha's death, but considered only the main characters and some events before or after the First Council historical. Other scholars, such as Bareau and Indologist Hermann Oldenberg, considered it likely that the account of the First Council was written after the Second Council, and based on that of the Second, since there were not any major problems to solve after the Buddha's death, or any other need to organize the First Council. Much material in the accounts, and even more so in the more developed later accounts, deal with Ānanda as the unsullied intermediary who passes on the legitimate teaching of the Buddha. On the other hand, archaeologist Louis Finot, Indologist E. E. Obermiller and to some extent Indologist Nalinaksha Dutt thought the account of the First Council was authentic, because of the correspondences between the Pāli texts and the Sanskrit traditions.\n\nĀnanda is recognized as one of the most important disciples of the Buddha. In the lists of the disciples given in the \"Aṅguttara Nikāya\" and Saṃyutta Nikāya, each of the disciples is declared to be foremost in some quality. Ānanda is mentioned more often than any other disciple: he is named foremost in conduct, in attention to others, in power of memory, in erudition and in resoluteness. Ānanda is the subject of a sermon of praise delivered by the Buddha just before the Buddha's death, as described in the \"Mahāparinibbāna Sutta\": it is a sermon about a man who is kindly, unselfish, popular, and thoughtful toward others. In the texts he is depicted as compassionate in his relations with lay people, a compassion he learnt from the Buddha. The Buddha relays that both monastics and lay people are pleased to see Ānanda, and are pleased to hear him recite and teach the Buddha's teaching. Moreover, Ānanda is known for his organizational skills, assisting the Buddha with secretary-like duties. In many ways, Ānanda does not only serve the personal needs of the Buddha, but also the needs of the still young, growing institute of the \"saṅgha\".\n\nMoreover, because of his ability to remember many teachings of the Buddha, he is described as foremost in \"having heard much\" (, , ). Ānanda is known for his exceptional memory, which is essential in helping him to remember the Buddha's teachings. He also teaches other disciples to memorize Buddhist doctrine. For these reasons, Ānanda is known as the \"Treasurer of the Dhamma\" (, ), \"Dhamma\" () referring to the doctrine of the Buddha. Being the person who has accompanied the Buddha throughout a great part of his life, Ānanda is in many ways the living memory of the Buddha, without which the \"saṅgha\" would be much worse off. Besides his memory skills, Ānanda also stands out in that, as the Buddha's cousin, he dares to ask the Buddha direct questions. For example, after the death of Mahāvira and the depicted subsequent conflicts among the Jain community, Ānanda asks the Buddha how such problems could be prevented after the Buddha's death. Findly argues that Ānanda's duty to memorize the Buddha's teachings accurately and without distortion, is \"both a gift and a burden\". Ānanda is able to remember many discourses verbatim, but this also goes hand-in-hand with a habit of not reflecting on those teachings, being afraid that reflection may distort the teachings as he heard them. Thus, judgment of Ānanda's character depends much on whether one judges his accomplishments as a monk or his accomplishments as an attendant and person memorizing the discourses. At multiple occasions, Ānanda is warned by other disciples that he should spend less time on conversing to lay people, and more time on his own practice. Even though Ānanda regularly practices meditation for long hours, he is less experienced in meditative concentration than other leading disciples.\n\nFrom a literary and pedagogical point of view, Ānanda often functions as a kind of foil in the texts, being an unenlightened disciple attending an enlightened Buddha. Because the run-of the-mill person can identify with Ānanda, the Buddha can through Ānanda convey his teachings to the mass easily. Ānanda's character is in many ways a contradiction to that of the Buddha: being unenlightened and someone who makes mistakes. At the same time, however, he is completely devoted to service to the Buddha. The Buddha is depicted in the early texts as both a father and a teacher to Ānanda, stern but compassionate. Ānanda is very fond of and attached to the Buddha, willing to give his life for him. He mourns the deaths of both Sāriputta, with whom he enjoyed a close friendship, and the Buddha: in both cases Ānanda is very shocked. Ānanda's faith for the Buddha, however, constitutes more of a faith in others, especially the Buddha's person, as opposed to faith in the Buddha's teaching. This is a pattern which comes back in the accounts which lead to the offenses Ānanda is charged with during the First Council. Moreover, Ānanda's weaknesses are that he is sometimes slow-witted and lacks mindfulness, which becomes noticeable because of his role as attendant to the Buddha: this involves minor matters like deportment, but also more important matters, such as ordaining a man with no future as a pupil, or disturbing the Buddha at the wrong time. For example, one time Mahākassapa chastises Ānanda in strong words, criticizing the fact that Ānanda was travelling with a large following of young monks who appeared untrained and who had built up a bad reputation. In another episode described in a Sarvāstivāda text, Ānanda is the only disciple who is willing to teach psychic powers to Devadatta, who later uses these in a failed attempt to destroy the Buddha. According to a Mahīśāsaka text, however, when Devadatta turns against the Buddha, Ānanda is not persuaded by him, and votes against him in a formal meeting. Ānanda's late spiritual growth is much discussed in Buddhist texts, and the general conclusion is that Ānanda is slower than other disciples due to his worldly attachments and his attachment to the person of the Buddha, both of which are rooted in his mediating work between the Buddha and the lay communities.\n\nAfter the Buddha's death, some sources say Ānanda stays mostly in the West of India, in the area of Kosambī (), where he teaches most of his pupils. Other sources say he stays in the monastery at Veḷuvana (). Several pupils of Ānanda became well-known in their own right. According to post-canonical Sanskrit sources such as the Divyavadāna and the Aśokavadāna, before the Buddha's death, the Buddha confides to Ānanda that his student Majjhantika () will travel to Udyāna, Kashmir, to bring the teaching of the Buddha there. Mahākassapa makes a prediction that later comes true that another of Ānanda's future pupils, Sāṇavāsī (), will make many gifts to the \"saṅgha\" at Mathurā, during a feast held from profits of successful business. After this event, Ānanda will successfully persuade Sāṇavāsī to become ordained and be his pupil. Ānanda persuades Sāṇavāsī by pointing out that he has now made many material gifts, but has not given \"the gift of the Dhamma\". When asked for explanation, Ānanda explains that Sāṇavāsī will give the gift of Dhamma by becoming ordained as a monk, which is enough reason for Sāṇavāsī to make the decision to get ordained.\n\nThough no Early Buddhist Text provides a date for Ānanda's death, according to Faxian, Ānanda goes on to live a 120 years. Following the later timeline, however, Ānanda may have lived to 7585 years. Buddhist studies scholar L. S. Cousins dated Ānanda's death twenty years after the Buddha's.\n\nĀnanda is teaching till the end of his life. According to Mūlasarvāstivāda sources, Ānanda hears a young monk recite a verse incorrectly, and advises him. When the monk reports this to his teacher, the latter objects that \"Ānanda has grown old and his memory is impaired ...\" This prompts Ānanda to attain final Nirvana. He passes on the \"custody of the [Buddha's] doctrine\" to his pupil Sāṇavāsī and leaves for the river Ganges. However, according to Pāli sources, when Ānanda is about to die, he decides to spend his final moments in Vesālī instead, and travels to the river Rohīni. The Mūlasarvāstivāda version expands and says that before reaching the river, he meets with a seer called Majjhantika (following the prediction earlier) and five hundred of his followers, who convert to Buddhism. Some sources add that Ānanda passes the Buddha's message on to him. As Ānanda is crossing the river, he is followed by King Ajāsattu (), who wants to witness his death and is interested in his remains as relics. Ānanda had once promised Ajāsattu that he would let him know when he would die, and now, after Ānanda has informed him, he follows him. On the other side of the river, however, a group of Licchavis from Vesālī await him for the same reason. In the Pāli, the two parties are the Sākiyan and the Koliyan clans instead. Ānanda realizes that his death on either side of the river could irritate one of the parties involved. Through a supernatural accomplishment, he therefore surges into the air to levitate and meditate in mid-air, making his body go up in fire, with his relics landing on both banks of the river, or in some versions of the account, splitting in four parts. In this way, Ānanda has pleased all the parties involved. In some other versions of the account, including the Mūlasarvāstivāda version, his death takes place on a barge in the middle of the river, however, instead of in mid-air. The remains are divided in two, following the wishes of Ānanda.\n\nMajjhantika later successfully carries out the mission following the Buddha's prediction. The latter's pupil Upagupta is described to be the teacher of King Aśoka (3th century BCE). Together with four or five other pupils of Ānanda, Sāṇavāsī and Majjhantika form the majority of the Second Council, with Majjhantika being Ānanda's last pupil. Post-canonical Pāli sources add that Sāṇavāsī has a leading role in the Third Buddhist Council as well. Although little is historically certain, Cousins thinks it is likely at least one of the leading figures on the Second Council was a pupil of Ānanda, as nearly all the textual traditions mention a connection with Ānanda.\n\nAjāsattu is said to have built a \"stūpa\" on top of the Ānanda's relics, at the river Rohīni, or according to some sources, the Ganges; the Licchavis have also built a \"stūpa\" at their side of the river. The Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang (60264 CE) later visits \"stūpas\" on both sides of the river Rohīni. Faxian also reports having visited \"stūpas\" dedicated to Ānanda at the river Rohīni, but also in Mathurā. Moreover, according to the Mūlasarvāstivāda version of the Saṃyukta Āgama, King Aśoka visits and makes the most lavish offerings he ever made to a \"stūpa\". He explains to his ministers that he does this because \"[t]he body of the Tathāgata is the body of dharma(s), pure in nature. He [Ananda] was able to retain it/them all; for this reason the offerings [to him] surpass [all others]\"\"body of dharma\" here refers to the Buddha's teachings as a whole.\n\nIn Early Buddhist Texts, Ānanda has reached final Nirvana and will no longer be reborn. But, in contrast with the early texts, according to the Mahāyāna Lotus Sūtra, Ānanda will be born as a Buddha in the future. He will accomplish this slower than the present Buddha, Gotama Buddha, has accomplished this, because Ānanda aspires to becoming a Buddha by applying \"great learning\". Because of this long trajectory and great efforts, however, his enlightenment will be extraordinary and with great splendor.\n\nĀnanda is depicted as an eloquent speaker, who often teaches about the self and about meditation. There are numerous Buddhist texts attributed to Ānanda, including the \"Atthakanāgara Sutta\", about meditation methods to attain Nirvana; a version of the \"Bhaddekaratta Sutta\" (, ), about living in the present moment; the \"Sekha Sutta\", about the higher training of a disciple of the Buddha; the \"Subha Suttanta\", about the practices the Buddha inspired others to follow. In the \"Gopaka-Mogallānasutta\", a conversation takes place between Ānanda, the brahmin Gopaka-Mogallāna and the minister Vassakara, the latter being the highest official of the Magadha region. During this conversation, which occurs shortly after the Buddha's death, Vassakara asks whether it is decided yet who will succeed the Buddha. Ānanda replies that no such successor has been appointed, but that the Buddhist community takes the Buddha's teaching and discipline as a refuge instead. Furthermore, the \"saṅgha\" may not have the Buddha as a master anymore, but they will honor those monks who are virtuous and trustworthy. Besides these \"suttas\", a section of the \"Theragāthā\" is attributed to Ānanda. Even in the texts attributed to the Buddha himself, Ānanda is sometimes depicted giving a name to a particular text, or suggesting a simile to the Buddha to use in his teachings.\n\nIn East Asian Buddhism, Ānanda is considered on of the ten principal disciples. In many Indian Sanskrit and East Asian texts, Ānanda is considered the second patriarch of the lineage which transmitted the teaching of the Buddha, with Mahākassapa being the first and Majjhantika or Saṇavāsī being the third. There is an account dating back from the Sarvāstivāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda textual traditions which states that before Mahākassapa dies, he bestows the Buddha's teaching on Ānanda as a formal passing on of authority, telling Ānanda to pass the teaching on to Ānanda's pupil Saṇavāsī. Later, just before Ānanda dies, he does as Mahākassapa has told him to. Buddhist Studies scholar Akira Hirakawa and Bibhuti Baruah have expressed skepticism about this teacherstudent relationship, arguing that there was discord between the two, as indicated in the early texts. Regardless, it is clear from the texts that a relationship of transmission of teachings is meant, as opposed to a \"upajjhāya\"student relationship in a lineage of ordination: no source indicates Mahākassapa is Ānanda's \"upajjhāya\". Whatever the case, in Mahāyāna iconography, Ānanda is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the right side, together with Mahākassapa at the left. In Theravāda iconography, however, Ānanda is usually not depicted in this manner, and the motif of transmission of the Dhamma through a list of patriarchs is not found in Pāli sources.\n\nBecause Ānanda was instrumental in founding the \"bhikkhunī\" community, he has been honored by \"bhikkhunīs\" for this throughout Buddhist history. The earliest traces of this can be found in the writings of the Chinese pilgrim monks Faxian and Xuan Zang, who reported that \"bhikkhunīs\" made offerings to a \"stūpa\" in Ānanda's honor during celebrations and observance days. On a similar note, in 5th6th-century China and 10th-century Japan, Buddhist texts were composed recommending women to uphold the semi-monastic eight precepts in honor and gratitude of Ānanda. In Japan, this was through the format of a penance ritual called \"keka\" (). By the 13th century, a cult-like interest for Ānanda had developed in a number of convents, which included images, \"stūpas\" and ceremonies in his honor. Presently, opinions among scholars are divided as to whether Ānanda's cult among \"bhikkhunīs\" was an expression of their dependence on male monastic tradition, or the opposite, an expression of their legitimacy and independence.\n\nPāli Vinaya texts attribute the design of the Buddhist monk's robe to Ānanda. As Buddhism prospers, more laypeople start to donate expensive cloth for robes, which puts the monks at risk for theft. To decrease its commercial value, monks therefore cut up the cloth offered, before they sow a robe from it. The Buddha asks Ānanda to think of a model for a Buddhist robe, made from small pieces of cloth. Ānanda designs a standard robe model, based on the rice fields of Magadha, which are divided in sections by banks of earth. Another tradition that is connected to Ānanda is \"paritta\" recitation. Theravāda Buddhists explain that the custom of sprinkling water during \"paritta\" chanting originates in Ānanda's visit to Vesālī, when he recites the \"Ratana Sutta\" and sprinkles water from his alms bowl. A third tradition sometimes attributed to Ānanda is the use of Bodhi trees in Buddhism. It is described in the text \"Kāliṅgabodhi Jātaka\" that Ānanda plants a Bodhi tree as a symbol of the Buddha's enlightenment, to give people the chance to pay their respects to the Buddha. This tree and shrine came to be known as the Ānanda Bodhi Tree, said to have grown from a seed from the original Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha is depicted to have attained enlightenment. Many of this type of Bodhi Tree shrines in Southeast Asia were erected following this example. Presently, the Ānanda Bodhi Tree is sometimes identified with a tree at the ruins of Jetavana, Sāvatthi, based on the records of the Chinese pilgrim Faxian (337422 CE).\n\nIn conclusion, Ānanda is one of the most loved figures in Buddhism. Although he is not as wise as some of the other main disciples, he is beloved because of his devotion to the Buddha and sincere efforts to understand and disseminate the Buddha's teachings.\n\nBetween 1856 and 1858 Richard Wagner wrote a draft for an opera libretto based on the legend about Ānanda and the low-caste girl Prakṛti. He left only a fragmentary prose sketch of a work to be called \"Die Sieger\", but the topic inspired his later opera \"Parsifal\". Furthermore, the draft was used by composer Jonathan Harvey in his 2007 opera Wagner Dream. In Wagner's version of the legend, which he based on orientalist Eugène Burnouf's translations, the magical spell of Prakṛti's mother does not work on Ānanda, and Prakṛti turns to the Buddha to explain her desires for Ānanda. The Buddha replies that a union between Prakṛti and Ānanda is possible, but Prakṛti must agree to the Buddha's conditions. Prakṛti agrees, and it is revealed that the Buddha means something else than she does: he asks Prakṛti to ordain as a \"bhikkhunī\", and live the celibate life as a kind of sister to Ānanda. Although Prakṛti at first cries of misery, after the Buddha explains that her current situation is a result of karma from her previous life, she understands and rejoices in the life of a \"bhikkhunī\". Apart from the spiritual themes, Wagner also addresses the faults of the caste system by having the Buddha criticize it.\n\nDrawing from Schopenhauer's philosophy, Wagner contrasts desire-driven salvation and true spiritual salvation: by seeking deliverance through the person she loves, Prakṛti only affirms her \"will to live\" (), which is blocking her from attaining deliverance. By being ordained as a \"bhikkhunī\" she strives for her spiritual salvation instead. Thus, the early Buddhist account of Mahāpajāpati's ordination is replaced by that of Prakṛti. According to Wagner, by allowing Prakṛti to become ordained, the Buddha also completes his own aim in life: \"[H]e regards his existence in the world, whose aim was to benefit all beings, as completed, since he had become able to offer deliverancewithout mediationalso to woman.\"\n\nThe same legend of Ānanda and Prakṛti was made into a short prose play by the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, called \"Chandalika\". \"Chandalika\" deals with the themes of spiritual conflict, caste and social equality, and contains a strong critique of Indian society. Just like in the traditional account, Prakṛti falls in love with Ānanda, after he gives her self-esteem by accepting a gift of water from her. Prakṛti's mother casts a spell to enchant Ānanda. In Tagore's play, however, Prakṛti later regrets what she has done and has the spell revoked.\n\n\n\n"}
