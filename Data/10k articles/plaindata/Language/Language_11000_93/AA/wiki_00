The law was made public and put into effect after it was published in the \"Resmi Gazete\" a week after its promulgation. According to the Interior Minister Şükrü Kaya:\nTaking into consideration security and political concerns, the law closed strategic regions of the country to non-Muslim minority settlement. Turkish politicians understood that many non-Turks had been resettled on their own into separate villages and therefore had not assimilated into Turkishness. Those individuals who \"spoke alien dialects\" had been able to differentiate themselves from the Turkish nation. It was a necessity to assess those villages in which such \"alien dialects\" were spoken and to distribute populations which spoke the \"alien dialects\" to nearby Turkish villages in order to foster and encourage forced assimilation.\n\nUnder Article I of the law, the Minister of Interior was granted the right to govern and redistribute the interior population of the country in accordance with an individual's adherence to Turkish culture. Article 11 was a provision regarding that the resettlement must assure 'unity in language, culture and blood'.\n\nThe settlement zones were divided in three separate zones according to the adherence of Turkish culture in the each particular individual:\n\nIn paragraph Four of Article 10, the Ministry of Interior was granted the authority to transfer any individual who did not possess a certain degree of \"Turkish culture\" to Zone 2, where forced assimilatory practices would take place.\n\nAccording to Article 12, those individuals who did not speak Turkish and were in Zone 1 and were not transferred Zone 2 must be settled in villages, towns, and districts that had a preexisting dominance of Turkish culture in order to foster assimilation.\n\nThe law also required the resettlement of Muslim minorities such as Circassians, Albanians, and Abkhazes who were considered Muslims who had failed to fully adhere to the Turkish nation. Although these minorities shared the same faith as their Turkish counterparts, it was still considered a goal by the politicians of the Turkish Republic to bind all peoples of Turkey to become Turkish.\n\nAlthough the Law on Settlement was expected to operate as an instrument for Turkifying the mass of non-Turkish speaking citizens, it immediately emerged as a piece of legislation which sparked riots by non-Muslims, as evidenced in the 1934 Thrace pogroms in the immediate aftermath of the law's passage. Law No. 2510 was issued on 14 June 1934, and the Thrace pogroms began just over a fortnight later, on 3 July. The incidents seeking to force out the region's non-Muslim residents first began in Çanakkale, where Jews received unsigned letters telling them to leave the city, and then escalated into an antisemitic campaign involving economic boycotts and verbal assaults as well as physical violence against the Jews living in the various provinces of Thrace. It is estimated that out of a total 15,000-20,000 Jews living in the region, more than half fled to Istanbul during and after the incidents. However, although the Law on Settlement may well have actually provoked the incidents’ outbreak, the national authorities did not side with the attackers but immediately intervened in the incidents. After order was restored, the governors and mayors of the provinces involved were removed from office.\n\nThe law played a major role in the events in Dersim in 1938 known as the Dersim rebellion. Forced resettlement was used in the depopulation of Dersim in Eastern Turkey in 1937-1938, where, according to McDowall, 40,000 people were killed. In seventeen days of the 1938 offensive alone, 7,954 persons were reported killed or caught alive. According to official Turkish reports, almost 10 percent of the entire population of Tunceli was killed. The Kurds claim that their losses were even higher.\n\nThe 1934 Turkish Resettlement Law was the legal justification used for the forced resettlement. It was used primarily to target the region of Dersim as one of its first test cases, which left disastrous consequences for the local population.\n\n\nTurkish Government Sources\n"}

As a system, it consists of various sizes of punch-down blocks, cable distribution accessories (such as moulded rings and strips), and a punch-down tool to terminate wires at the punch-down block. The BIX cross-connect system as a whole is certified for Category-5e. The BIX cross-connect system is primarily composed of two parts: the mounts, and the connectors.\n\nBIX mounts are wall-mounted frames, generally built from 16 gauge steel. The frames feature a rectangular plastic backplate, and two plastic brackets that extend from either side of the backplate to fit between two and ten BIX connectors. The connectors are oriented horizontally on the mount. The BIX mounts are referred to as either '12E','10A' or '10C'. The 12E frames will mount up to 12 connectors; The 10A frames will mount up to 10 connectors; the 10C frames will mount 2 connectors.\n\nBIX connectors are rectangular punch-down blocks used to terminate up to 25 pairs. The connecters have a slip-in fitting which automatically strips the wire as it is punched down, eliminating the need for pre-stripping. BIX connectors also have a pair-splitter to facilitate fast arranging of wires on the punch-down block.\n\nThere are many types of BIX connectors, the most popular kinds being the 1A and the 1A4.\n\n1A: Distribution connector, 5-pair markings\n\n1A4: Distribution connector, 4-pair markings\n\n2A: Bridging connector, 12 2-pair clips\n\n5A: Multiplying connector, 5-pair markings\n\n7A: Key apparatus connector\n\n9A: Diode connector, 24 diodes\n\n36B, 36C, 36D: Modular RJ-11 jack connector\n\nNORDX/CDT developed the GigaBIX IDC–based system with a transmission performance that\ngoes beyond the Category-6 standard and is available in two topologies: the Patch Cord topology and the Cross-Connect Wire topology. It is based on the mature BIX technology, which is over 25 years old and well-established in the telecommunications industry. The termination and installation procedures have been improved, allowing the quality of the system to surpass Category-6. The system guarantees channel bandwidths up to 300 MHz, and can transmit data up to 4.8 Gbit/s.\n\nThe GigaBIX system is primarily made up of mounts and connectors. The Patch Cord topology utilizes GigaBIX PS6+ patch cords which are 4 pair 23-AWG UTP cords with a channel bandwidth of 250 MHz or 300 MHz, depending on how they are employed. These patch cords are typically used with the and the Cross-Connect topology utilizes GigaBIX cross-connect wire. Both topologies utilize the same mounts, connectors, distribution frames, and other accessories (such as designation strips, wire guards, covers, distribution rings, and many other accessories).\n\nSince the 1970s, Northern Telecom (Nortel), who designed the BIX system, had been manufacturing BIX mounts, connectors and tools in house. Northern Telecom's manufacturing division was called Nortel Cable Group. In February 1996, Nortel Cable Group was sold to Cable Design Technologies Corporation and was renamed to NORDX/CDT. NORDX/CDT subsequently merged with Belden Inc in July 2004, becoming Belden CDT Inc. In May 2007, Belden CDT officially changed its name to Belden.\nBelden now sells all BIX products including mounts, connectors, tools and accessories previously sold by NORDX/CDT, and before that, Nortel Cable Group.\n\n"}
{"id": "221697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221697", "title": "Blacklisting", "text": "Blacklisting\n\nBlacklisting is the action of a group or authority, compiling a blacklist (or black list) of people, countries or other entities to be avoided or distrusted as not being acceptable to those making the list. A blacklist can list people to be discriminated against, refused employment, or censored. As a verb, blacklist can mean to put an individual or entity on such a list.\n\nThe English dramatist Philip Massinger used the phrase \"black list\" in his 1639 tragedy \"The Unnatural Combat\". \n\nAfter the Restoration of the English monarchy brought Charles II of England to the throne in 1660, a list of regicides named those to be punished for the execution of his father. The state papers of Charles II say \"If any innocent soul be found in this black list, let him not be offended at me, but consider whether some mistaken principle or interest may not have misled him to vote\". \nIn a 1676 history of the events leading up to the Restoration, James Heath (a supporter of Charles II) alleged that Parliament had passed an Act requiring the sale of estates, \"And into this black list the Earl of Derby was now put, and other unfortunate Royalists\". \n\nEdward Gibbon wrote in \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1776) of Andronicus that \"His memory was stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals, who had traduced his merit, opposed his greatness, or insulted his misfortunes\".\n\nThe first published reference to blacklisting of an employee dates from 1774. This became a significant employment issue in American mining towns and company towns, where blacklisting could mean a complete loss of livelihood for workers who went on strike. The 1901 Report of the Industrial Commission stated \"There was no doubt in the minds of workingmen of the existence of the blacklisting system, though it was practically impossible to obtain evidence of it.\" It cited a news report that in 1895 a former conductor on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad committed suicide, having been out of work ever since a strike: \"Wherever he went the blacklist was ahead of him\".\n\nThough the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 outlawed punitive blacklists against employees who supported trade unions or criticised their employers, the practice continued in common use. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 made amendments which sustained blacklisting by affirming the right of employers to be anti-union, and by requiring trade union leaders to make loyalty oaths which had the same effect as the Hollywood blacklist. Since then, lawsuits for unfair dismissal have led to blacklisting being covert or informal, but it remains common.\n\nDuring World War I, the British government adopted a \"blacklist\" based on an Order in Council of 23 December 1915, prohibiting British subjects from trade with specified firms and individuals in neutral countries; the lists were published in the \"London Gazette\".\n\nIn the summer of 1940, the SS printed a secret list called \"Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.\" (\"Special Search List Great Britain\") as part of Nazi Germany's preparations for invasion codenamed Operation Sea Lion – when this booklet was found after the war, it was commonly called the Black Book and described as a blacklist.\n\nThe Hollywood blacklist was instituted by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 to block screenwriters and other Hollywood professionals who were purported to have Communist sympathies from obtaining employment. It started by listing 151 entertainment industry professionals and lasted until 1960 when it was effectively broken by the acknowledgement that blacklisted professionals had been working under assumed names for many years.\n\nBlacklisting by multiple providers is a systematic act by doctors to deny care to a certain patient or patients. It is done in various ways for various reasons; blacklisting is not new. In 1907 the Transvaal Medical Union in South Africa blacklisted patients if they could not pay cash in advance. In this case, there was a physical list kept by the community of physicians. A physical list is not necessary to blacklist patients but the effect is the same.\n\nThe United States Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) found that reviewed hospitals did not generate incident reports for 93% of adverse events. The 7% of the time when they did generate reports, the information was inaccurate 63% of the time. Problems causing harm to patients were reported accurately only 2% of the time. If blacklisting is multiple providers systematically denying care to a certain patient or patients, in this case patients with iatrogenic injuries, it is reasonable to define it as blacklisting when 98% of the time the first group, treatment providers, singles out members of the second group, injured patients, to prevent them from having an accurate record made of what injured them. Those patients are further injured by not having the accurate record necessary for getting care for the injuries.\n\nCompanies which have a payment card merchant account terminated, and their directors, are often added to a list referred to when companies apply for an account; they are then unlikely to be granted a new account by any provider. In the US the list is called TMF/MATCH.\n\nIn computing, a blacklist is an access control system that denies entry to a specific list (or a defined range) of users, programs, or network addresses.\n"}

The containers, along with a manifest, are taken to an area in a post office called a bulk-mail-entry unit. The presorting and the use of containers allow highly automated mail processing, both in bulk and piecewise, in processing facilities called bulk mail centers (BMCs).\n\nIn 2009, the USPS announced plans to streamline sorting and delivery, which would recast the BMCs as \"Network Distribution Centers\".\n\nAlthough bulk mail, junk mail, and admail are, strictly speaking, not synonymous, the terms are used in common parlance to refer to unsolicited invitations delivered by mail (typically, but not invariably, at bulk rates) to homes and businesses.\n\n"}

{"id": "18973788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18973788", "title": "Dash", "text": "Dash\n\nThe dash is a punctuation mark that is similar in appearance to and , but differs from these symbols in both length and height. The most common versions of the dash are the en dash (–), equal to half the height of the font; the em dash (—), twice as long as the en dash; and the horizontal bar (―), whose length varies across typefaces.\n\nHistorically, the names of en dash and em dash were loosely related to the width of a lower-case \"n\" and upper-case \"M\", respectively, in commonly used typefaces.\n\nUsage varies both within English and in other languages, but the usual convention in printed English text is as follows:\n\nThere are several forms of dash, of which the most common are:\n\nLess common are the two-em dash (⸺) and three-em dash (⸻), both added to Unicode with version 6.1 as U+2E3A and U+2E3B.\n\nThe figure dash (‒) is so named because it is the same width as a digit, at least in fonts with digits of equal width. This is true of most fonts, not only monospaced fonts.\n\nThe figure dash is used within numbers (e.g. phone number 555‒0199), especially in columns for maintaining alignment. Its meaning is the same as a hyphen, as represented by the hyphen-minus glyph; by contrast, the en dash is more appropriately used to indicate a range of values; the minus sign also has a separate glyph.\n\nThe figure dash is often unavailable; in this case, one may use a hyphen-minus instead. In Unicode, the figure dash is (decimal 8210). HTML authors must use the numeric forms codice_1 or codice_2 to type it unless the file is in Unicode; there is no equivalent character entity.\n\nIn TeX, the standard fonts have no figure dash; however, the digits normally all have the same width as the en dash, so an en dash can be substituted when using standard TeX fonts. In XeLaTeX, one could use codice_3 (Linux Libertine font has the figure dash glyph).\n\nThe en dash, en rule, or nut (–) is traditionally half the width of an em dash.\nIn modern fonts, the length of the en dash is not standardized, and the en dash is often more than half the width of the em dash. The widths of en and em dashes have also been specified as being equal to those of the upper-case letters N and M respectively,\nand at other times to the widths of the lower-case letters.\n\nThe two main uses of the en dash are to connect symmetric items, such as the two ends of a range or two competitors or alternatives, and as a substitute for a hyphen in a compound when one of the connected items is more complex than a single word.\n\nThe en dash is commonly used to indicate a closed range of values—a range with clearly defined and finite upper and lower boundaries—roughly signifying what might otherwise be communicated by the word \"through\". This may include ranges such as those between dates, times, or numbers. Various style guides restrict this range indication style to only parenthetical or tabular matter, requiring \"to\" or \"through\" in running text. Preference for hyphen vs. en dash in ranges varies. For example, the APA style (named after the American Psychological Association) uses an en dash in ranges, but the AMA style (named after the American Medical Association) uses a hyphen:\n\nVarious style guides (including the \"Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)\" and the \"AMA Manual of Style\") recommend that when a number range might be misconstrued as subtraction, the word \"to\" should be used instead of an en dash. For example, \"a voltage of 50 V to 100 V\" is preferable to using \"a voltage of 50–100 V\". Relatedly, in ranges that include negative numbers, \"to\" is used to avoid ambiguity or awkwardness (for example, \"temperatures ranged from −18 °C to −34 °C\", or alternately, −18 °C...−34 °C). It is also considered poor style (best avoided) to use the en dash in place of the words \"to\" or \"and\" in phrases that follow the forms \"from X to Y\" and \"between X and Y\".\n\nThe en dash can also be used to contrast values, or illustrate a relationship between two things. Examples of this usage include:\n\nAmong writers who use en dashes in these contexts, a distinction is often made between \"simple\" attributive compounds (written with a hyphen) and other subtypes (written with an en dash); at least one authority considers name pairs, where the paired elements carry equal weight, as in the Taft–Hartley Act to be \"simple\", while others consider an en dash appropriate in instances such as these to represent the parallel relationship, as in the McCain–Feingold bill or Bose–Einstein statistics. However, there is a difference between something named for a parallel/coordinate relationship between two people (for example, Bose and Einstein) and something named for a single person who had a compound surname, which may be written with a hyphen or a space but not an en dash (for example, the Lennard-Jones potential [hyphen] is named after one person (Mr. John Lennard-Jones), as are Bence Jones proteins and Hughlings Jackson syndrome [space]). Copyeditors use dictionaries (general, medical, biographical, and geographical) to confirm the eponymity (and thus the styling) for specific terms, given that no one can know them all offhand.\n\nThe preference for an en dash instead of a hyphen in these coordinate/relationship/connection types of terms is a matter of style preference, not inherent orthographic \"correctness\"; both are equally \"correct\", and each is the preferred style in some style guides. For example, the \"American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", the \"AMA Manual of Style\", and Dorland's medical reference works use hyphens, not en dashes, in coordinate terms (such as \"blood–brain barrier\"), in eponyms (such as \"Cheyne–Stokes respiration\", \"Kaplan–Meier method\"), and so on.\n\nIn English, the en dash is usually used instead of a hyphen in compound (phrasal) attributives in which one or both elements is itself a compound, especially when the compound element is an open compound, meaning it is not itself hyphenated. This manner of usage may include such examples as:\n\nThe disambiguating value of the en dash in these patterns was illustrated by Strunk and White in \"The Elements of Style\" with the following example: When \"Chattanooga News\" and \"Chattanooga Free Press\" merged, the joint company was inaptly named \"Chattanooga News-Free Press\" (using a hyphen), which could be interpreted as meaning that their newspapers were news-free.\n\nAn exception to the use of en dashes is usually made when prefixing an already-hyphenated compound; an en dash is generally avoided as a distraction in this case. Examples of this include:\n\nAn en dash can be retained to avoid ambiguity, but whether any ambiguity is plausible is a judgment call. AMA style retains the en dashes in the following examples:\n\nAs discussed above, the en dash is sometimes recommended instead of a hyphen in compound adjectives where neither part of the adjective modifies the other—that is, when each modifies the noun, as in \"love–hate relationship\".\n\n\"The Chicago Manual of Style\" (\"CMOS\"), however, limits the use of the en dash to two main purposes:\n\nThat is, the \"CMOS\" favors hyphens in instances where some other guides suggest en dashes, the 16th edition explaining that \"Chicago's sense of the en dash does not extend to \"between\"\", to rule out its use in \"US–Canadian relations\".\n\nIn these two uses, en dashes normally do not have spaces around them. An exception is made when avoiding spaces may cause confusion or look odd. For example, compare \"12 June – 3 July\" with \"12 June–3 July\".\n\nLike em dashes, en dashes can be used instead of colons or pairs of commas that mark off a nested clause or phrase. They can also be used around parenthetical expressions – such as this one – in place of the em dashes preferred by some publishers, particularly where short columns are used, since em dashes can look awkward at the end of a line. (See En dash versus em dash below.) In these situations, en dashes must have a single space on each side.\n\nEither the en dash or the em dash may be used as a bullet at the start of each item in a bulleted list. (This is a matter of graphic design rather than orthography.)\n\nIn most uses of en dashes, such as when used in indicating ranges, they are closed up to the joined words. It is only when en dashes take the role of em dashes – for example, in setting off parenthetical statements such as this one – that they take spaces around them. For more on the choice of em versus en in this context, see En dash versus em dash.\n\nWhen an en dash is unavailable in a particular character encoding environment—as in the ASCII character set—there are some conventional substitutions. Often two hyphens are the substitute.\n\nIn Unicode, the en dash is U+2013 (decimal 8211). In HTML, one may use the numeric forms codice_4 or codice_5; there is also the HTML entity codice_6.\n\nThe en dash is sometimes used as a substitute for the minus sign, when the minus sign character is not available, since the en dash is usually the same width as a plus sign. For example, the original 8-bit Macintosh Character Set had an en dash, useful for the minus sign, years before Unicode with a dedicated minus sign was available. The hyphen-minus is usually too narrow to make a typographically acceptable minus sign. However, the en dash cannot be used for a minus sign in programming languages because the syntax usually requires a hyphen-minus.\n\nThe em dash, em rule, or mutton (—) is longer than an en dash. The character is called an \"em dash\" because it is one em wide, a length that varies depending on the font size. One em is the same length as the font's height (which is typically measured in points). So in 9-point type, an em dash is 9 points wide, while in 24-point type the em dash is 24 points wide. By comparison, the en dash, with its 1-en width, is in most fonts either a half-em wide\nor the width of an \"n\".\n\nThe em dash is used in several ways: primarily in places where a set of parentheses or a colon might otherwise be used, it can show an abrupt change in thought or be used where a full stop (period) is too strong and a comma too weak. Em dashes are also used to set off summaries or definitions. Common uses and definitions are cited below with examples.\n\n\n\n\nIt may indicate an interpolation stronger than that demarcated by parentheses, as in the following from Nicholson Baker's \"The Mezzanine\". (The degree of difference is subjective.) \n\nIn this use, it is sometimes doubled:\n\nIn a related use, it may visually indicate the shift between speakers when they overlap in speech. For example, the em dash is used this way in Joseph Heller's \"Catch-22\":\n\n\nThis is a quotation dash. It may be distinct from an em dash in its coding (see Horizontal bar). It may be used to indicate turns in a dialog, in which case each dash starts a paragraph. It replaces other quotation marks, and was preferred by authors such as James Joyce: \n\nAn em dash may be used to indicate omitted letters in a word redacted to an initial or single letter or to fillet a word, by leaving the start and end letters whilst replacing the middle letters with a dash or dashes (for the purposes of censorship or simply data anonymization). In this use, it is sometimes doubled.\nThree em dashes might be used to indicate a completely missing word.\n\nEither the en dash or the em dash may be used as a bullet at the start of each item in a bulleted list, but a plain hyphen is more commonly used (and even mandatory in formats like Markdown).\n\nThree em dashes one after another can be used in a footnote, endnote, or another form of bibliographic entry to indicate repetition of the same author's name as that of the previous work, which is similar to the use of ibid.\n\nAccording to most American sources (such as \"The Chicago Manual of Style\") and some British sources (such as \"The Oxford Guide to Style\"), an em dash should always be set closed, meaning it should not be surrounded by spaces. But the practice in some parts of the English-speaking world, including the style recommended by \"The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage\" for printed newspapers and the \"AP Stylebook\", sets it open, separating it from its surrounding words by using spaces or hair spaces (U+200A) when it is being used parenthetically. The \"AP Stylebook\" rejects the use of the open em dash to set off introductory items in lists. Some writers, finding the em dash unappealingly long, prefer to use an open-set en dash. This \"space, en dash, space\" sequence is also the predominant style in German and French typography. (See En dash versus em dash below.)\n\nOn a practical note, when the em dash is set closed (not surrounded by spaces), it makes highlighting in ebooks difficult, as two words are often treated as conjoined.\n\nIn Canada, \"The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing\", \"The Oxford Canadian A to Z of Grammar, Spelling & Punctuation: Guide to Canadian English Usage\" (2nd ed.), \"Editing Canadian English\", and the \"Canadian Oxford Dictionary\" all specify that an em dash should be set closed when used between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals.\n\nThe Australian government's \"Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers\" (6th ed.), also specifies that em dashes inserted between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals, should be set closed. A section on the 2-em rule (⸺) also explains that the 2-em can be used to mark an abrupt break in direct or reported speech, but a space is used before the 2-em if a complete word is missing, while no space is used if part of a word exists before the sudden break. Two examples of this are as follows (properly typeset 2-em and 3-em dashes should appear as a single dash, but they may show on this page as several em dashes with spaces in between):\n\nMonospaced fonts that mimic the look of a typewriter have the same width for all characters. Some of these fonts have em and en dashes that more or less fill the monospaced width they have available. For example, the sequence \"hyphen, en dash, em dash, minus\" shows as \"codice_7\" in a monospace font.\n\nWhen an em dash is unavailable in a particular character encoding environment—as in the ASCII character set—it has usually been approximated as a double (--) or triple (---) hyphen-minus. The two-hyphen em dash proxy is perhaps more common, being a widespread convention in the typewriting era. (It is still described for hard copy manuscript preparation in the \"Chicago Manual of Style\" as of the 16th edition, although the manual conveys that typewritten manuscript and copyediting on paper are now dated practices). The three-hyphen em dash proxy was popular with various publishers because the sequence of one, two, or three hyphens could then correspond to the hyphen, en dash, and em dash, respectively.\n\nBecause early comic book letterers were not aware of the typographic convention of replacing a typewritten double hyphen with an em dash, the double hyphen became traditional in American comics. This practice has continued despite the development of computer lettering.\n\nThe en dash is wider than the hyphen but not as wide as the em dash. An em width is defined as the point size of the currently used font, since the M character is not always the width of the point size. In running text, various dash conventions are employed: an em dash—like so—or a spaced em dash — like so — or a spaced en dash – like so – can be seen in contemporary publications.\n\nVarious style guides and national varieties of languages prescribe different guidance on dashes. Dashes have been cited as being treated differently in the US and the UK, with the former preferring the use of an em dash with no additional spacing and the latter preferring a spaced en dash. As examples of the US style, \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" and \"The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association\" recommend unspaced em dashes. Style guides outside the US are more variable. For example, \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" by Canadian typographer Robert Bringhurst recommends the spaced en dash – like so – and argues that the length and visual magnitude of an em dash \"belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography\".\nIn the United Kingdom, the spaced en dash is the house style for certain major publishers, including the Penguin Group, the Cambridge University Press, and Routledge. However, this convention is not universal. The \"Oxford Guide to Style\" (2002, section 5.10.10) acknowledges that the spaced en dash is used by \"other British publishers\" but states that the Oxford University Press, like \"most US publishers\", uses the unspaced em dash.\n\nThe en dash – always with spaces in running text when, as discussed in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support full justification. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the unspaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated by the use of thin spaces, hair spaces, or even zero-width spaces on the sides of the em dash. This provides the appearance of an unspaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, a spaced en dash may be ambiguous when it is also used for ranges, for example, in dates or between geographical locations with internal spaces.\n\n, also known as a quotation dash, is used to introduce quoted text. This is the standard method of printing dialogue in some languages. The em dash is equally suitable if the quotation dash is unavailable or is contrary to the house style being used.\n\nThere is no support in the standard TeX fonts, but one can use codice_8 instead, or just use an em dash.\n\n resembles a lengthened tilde, and is used to separate alternatives or approximates. In dictionaries, it is frequently used to stand in for the term being defined. A dictionary entry providing an example for the term \"henceforth\" might employ the swung dash as follows:\n\nThere are several similar, related characters:\n\n\nIn many languages, such as Polish, the em dash is used as an opening quotation mark. There is no matching closing quotation mark; typically a new paragraph will be started, introduced by a dash, for each turn in the dialog.\n\nCorpus studies indicate that em dashes are more commonly used in Russian than in English. In Russian, the em dash is used for the present copula (meaning \"am\"/\"is\"/\"are\"), which is unpronounced in spoken Russian.\n\nIn French, em or en dashes can be used as parentheses (brackets), but the use of a second dash as a closing parenthesis is optional. When a closing dash is not used the sentence is ended with a period (full-stop) as usual. Dashes are, however, much less common than parentheses.\n\nIn Spanish, em dashes can be used to mark off parenthetical phrases. Unlike in English, the em dashes are spaced like brackets, i.e., there is a space between main sentence and dash, but not between parenthetical phrase and dash.\n“Llevaba la fidelidad a su maestro –un buen profesor– hasta extremos insospechados.”\n\nTypewriters and early computers have traditionally had only a limited character set, often having no key that produces a dash. In consequence, it became common to substitute the nearest available punctuation mark or symbol. Em dashes are often represented in British usage by a single hyphen-minus surrounded by spaces, or in American usage by two hyphen-minuses surrounded by spaces.\n\nModern computer software typically has support for many more characters and is usually capable of rendering both the en and em dashes correctly—albeit sometimes with an inconvenient input method. Some software, though, may operate in a more limited mode. Some text editors, for example, are restricted to working with a single 8-bit character encoding, and when unencodable characters are entered—for example by pasting from the clipboard—they are often blindly converted to question marks. Sometimes this happens to em and en dashes, even when the 8-bit encoding supports them or when an alternative representation using hyphen-minuses is an option.\n\nAny kind of dash can be used directly in an HTML document, but HTML also lets them be entered using character references. The em dash and the en dash are special in that they can be written using character entity references as and , respectively. Mozilla Thunderbird provides for entry of HTML sequences including and using its Insert drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n"}

According to some, it ultimately results in an inability to achieve orgasm with a partner due to desensitization from overstimulation.\n\nDeath-grip syndrome, sometimes abbreviated as DGS, is sometimes viewed as a subcategory of Inhibited ejaculation. The term was arguably coined in 2003 by sexpert Dan Savage and is an issue that affects both men and women. The concept however is, as of 2018, not recognized by medical bodies. Some writers have suggested such an indisposition arises from penile nerve endings becoming accustomized to more rough friction such as ribbed towels or other cloths used to catch semen. This, along with learned pressure, such as a specific hand speed may have subsequently altered sensory patters in the genitalia. However, others have attributed it to normal masturbation that is excessive. For females experiencing death grip syndrome, besides overly strenuous masturbation, it has also been attributed to excessively using high power settings of a vibrator or a showerhead with too much water pressure. Although men with the indisposition may still experience an erection, it may embroil a relationship negatively due to a sense of being sexually incompatible with a partner due to lasting too long, and subsequent side-effects such as blue balls or inhibited ejaculation. Some people who have claimed to have masturbated using the death-grip technique claim that although they can still experience pleasure, the typical vagina feels too loose, and fellatio provides insufficient friction to produce an orgasm. Richard Santucci, chief of urology at Detroit Receiving's Center for Urologic Reconstruction, has criticized the notion that this masturbation technique causes any issues. Therapist Michael A. Perelman on the other hand attributes the issue to a lack of diversity within masturbation. Some broader denotations of the death-grip are becoming accustomized to a very specific means of reaching orgasm, or the effects of constrictive pressure of a waistand, belt or undersized pouch on an erection.\n\n"}

Although many common law jurisdictions have rejected a categorical application of the rule, the doctrine has survived in some American courts.\n\nThe origins of the doctrine of \"falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\" in the common law have been traced as far back as the Stuart Treason Trials in the late seventeenth century. However, the widespread acceptance of the principle in seventeenth century English courts suggests that the doctrine has much earlier roots. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the principle functioned as a mandatory presumption that a witness was unreliable if they previously lied while offering testimony. By the early nineteenth century, English courts began instructing juries that they may presume a witness who testified falsely was unreliable, but such a presumption was not mandatory. In 1809, Lord Ellenborough rejected a categorical application of the rule, stating that \"though a person may be proved on his own shewing, or by other evidence, to have foresworn himself as to a particular fact; it does not follow that he can never afterwards feel the obligation of an oath.\" Although some American courts disfavor the mandatory application of the doctrine, others continue to uphold a mandatory presumption of unreliability for witnesses that have previously testified falsely.\n\nToday, many jurisdictions have abandoned the principle as a formal rule of evidence and instead apply the rule as a \"permissible inference that the jury may or may not draw.\" However, some courts continue to apply the doctrine to discredit witnesses that have previously offered false testimony. In 2013, for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that in immigration cases, a court may \"use an adverse credibility finding on one claim to support an adverse finding on another claim.\" Likewise, at the O.J. Simpson murder trial, Judge Lance Ito applied the doctrine to instruct the jury that \"[a] witness who is willfully false in one material part of his or her testimony is to be distrusted in others.\"\n\nDuring the 2018 confirmation hearings into the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination, Senator Richard Blumenthal questioned Kavanaugh's credibility when he asked Kavanaugh if he was familiar with the words, .\n\nMany legal scholars have criticized the continued use of the doctrine of \"falsus in uno\" to discredit a witness' entire testimony. For example, Judge Richard Posner once remarked that \"falsus in uno\" was a \"discredited doctrine\" based on \"primitive psychology.\" This assertion was not made in relation to fraudulent documentation or a “material” inconsistency; rather, it was based on what the court characterizes as “innocent mistakes, trivial inconsistencies, and harmless exaggerations” by the applicant during his testimony before an immigration judge. Indeed, later in the Kadia opinion, the court concedes that inconsistencies of less than material importance can be relevant to the assessment of veracity. Specifically, the court stated that “the mistakes that witnesses make in all innocence must be distinguished from slips that, whether or not they go to the core of the witness's testimony, show that the witness is a liar.” Judge Posner argued that because witnesses \"are prone to fudge, to fumble, to misspeak, to misstate, to exaggerate,\" few trials would reach a judgment if \"any such pratfall warranted disbelieving a witness's entire testimony.\" Additionally, evidence scholar John Henry Wigmore was an outspoken critic of the doctrine. In his \"Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law\", he wrote:\n\n"}

He was probably born in the Kingdom of Poland, in Poznań, later naturalized in Portugal. He sailed with several Portuguese fleets between Europe and India, including the fleet of Pedro Álvares Cabral that discovered Brazil and was known to speak several East and West languages. \n\nHis original name is unknown. He appears with the name \"Gaspar da Gama\" or \"Gaspar of the Indies\" in the chronicles and reports of discovery written by Gaspar Correia, Fernão Lopes de Castanheda, Jerónimo Osório, Damião de Góis and Álvaro Velho but was known to Indians as \"Mahmet\". Some sources confuse the latest with Gaspar de Lemos, a Portuguese sailor who commanded a ship in the fleet that discovered Brazil. Other sources also call him \"Gaspar de Almeida\" given his friendship with Francisco de Almeida, 1st Viceroy of India.\n\nThere are several versions of his life before meeting Vasco da Gama in India. Some of these were sourced at Gaspar da Gama himself, but he probably tried to hide some \"inconvenient\" facts about his own past. According to Gaspar's own account, he became a Jewish traveller, making his way to Jerusalem, and then Alexandria, where he was taken prisoner and sold as a slave in India, in India he secured his freedom in the service of the ruler of Goa. The chronicler Gaspar Correia states that, when found by the Portuguese, Gaspar da Gama was Captain of the fleet of Yusuf Adil Shah, the Sultan of Bijapur, Arab governor of Goa in India. Damião de Góis says Gaspar da Gama was a Jew born in the city of Poznań in the Kingdom of Poland and that at that time he did not speak Spanish, but the Venetian language, the very language used in European based commercial centers in the East.\n\nThe historian João de Barros, reports that the very Gaspar da Gama informed him that his parents were from Bosna (or Posner, i.e., Poznan) in Poland. His parents migrated to Jerusalem and then to Alexandria, where Gaspar da Gama was born. The Israeli journalist Elias Lipiner, studied the documentation of the Portuguese chroniclers of the Age of Discovery and considered João de Barros version as the most faithful to facts, suggesting that Gaspar da Gama must have been born in Alexandria (Egypt) around 1458. Following Jewish Radhanite trade routes at the time, he went very young to India where he established himself as a merchant. Other historians, such as the scholar of Brazilian Jewish history Arnold Wiznitzer, think he was born in Granada or circa 1440 in Bosnia (perhaps confusion with the name of Poznan).\n\nIn 1498, when the returning Vasco da Gama fleet landed on the island of Angediva, about 20 miles off the coast of Goa, Gaspar da Gama, uninvited, went on the ship of Vasco da Gama and asked happily to go aboard, to visit his native Spain. He was then more than 50 years age, with white beard, with louder and clear manners than that of the Indians of region. As reported by Álvaro Velho, clerk of the Portuguese fleet, Gaspar da Gama said that he was \"working for a powerful lord who owns an army of more than 40 thousand horsemen, and that upon hearing of their arrival he had asked to see them. If not he would have died of sadness.\"\n\nVasco da Gama pretended to believe, and discreetly sent men to Anjadip Island to get information about the visitor. Some reliable merchants told that he was a spy, preparing a surprise attack. Upon this, Vasco da Gama had the visitor whipped and interrogated under torture. After having hot oil dropped on his skin, Gaspar da Gama told he was a Jew from Granada who had converted to Christianity and after traveling to Turkey and Mecca went to the Indies, and that there was no plan to attack the Portuguese. After 12 days of interrogation, Vasco da Gama came to rely more on the prisoner. He gave him a cheese and two soft breads and Gaspar da Gama told him that, after all, he was very happy to find these \"Franks\".\n\nVasco da Gama kept Gaspar as a prisoner and took him on the eventful trip back to Portugal, perhaps considering that his knowledge of the East would be useful. During the long return, Gaspar da Gama befriended the Portuguese, and especially Vasco da Gama. He was baptized the following year, Vasco da Gama being his godfather and gaving him his own surname. The first name - Gaspar - had been chosen as a reference to its origins, being the name of one of three Magi from the East who visited Jesus.\n\nKing Manuel I of Portugal enjoyed Gaspar da Gama and called him frequently to the court, to hear his stories about the land and customs of the East. There was a suspicion that Gaspar da Gama was an Arabic spy, but the Portuguese recognized his value, because beside having traded in some of their centers in India, he spoke Latin, Arabic, Italian, Castilian, Portuguese and some languages of India. Because of this, the King Manuel I appointed him counselor and interpreter of the second fleet sailing to the Indies, led by Pedro Álvares Cabral.\n\nAlways with a cap on his head and dressed in white linen, Gaspar da Gama was one of the more exotic characters in the fleet of Pedro Álvares Cabral. Although not the only linguist at the expedition that discovered the Brazil, he was the main interpreter in the trade negotiations between the Portuguese and Brazilian Indians, along with Gonçalo Madeira. Once in India, Gaspar da Gama fulfilled his mission with his interpreter services and knowledge of geopolitics and customs of India important in business meetings of Portuguese and Indian rajas in Calicut and Cochin.\n\nHe returned on his own will to Portugal with Pedro Álvares Cabral. In 1501, the fleet met the expedition of Gaspar de Lemos appointed by the king of Portugal to explore the newly discovered lands of Brazil, near modern Dakar, Senegal. Talks between Gaspar da Gama and other members of the expedition with the Florentine Amerigo Vespucci who accompanied Gaspar de Lemos certainly strengthened the idea that the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus were not the Indies, but a new continent.\n\nIn 1502 Gaspar da Gama participated in another travel to India commanded by Vasco da Gama, and again in 1505 with the recently appointed viceroy Francisco de Almeida. During these trips, he learned a few African languages.\n\nHe participated in the Indian expeditions of the Portuguese who tried to conquer Hormuz in 1508 and Calicut in 1510, when some assume that he died. Others believe that he returned to Portugal where he died. Some say that his death occurred between 1510 and 1515, or even by about 1520, with nearly eighty years. The change of Christian name \"Terra de Santa Cruz\" to \"Brazil\" is attributed by some to Gaspar da Gama and Fernão de Noronha, both being Jewish. However, this does not have an historical basis, being due to the intense trade in Brazilwood.\n\n"}
{"id": "33336697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33336697", "title": "Gottscheerish", "text": "Gottscheerish\n\nGottscheerish (\"Göttscheabarisch\", , ) is an Upper German dialect which was the main language of communication among the Gottscheers in the enclave of Gottschee, Slovenia before 1941. It is occasionally referred to as Granish or Granisch in the United States (< German \"Krainisch\" 'Carniolan'), a term also used for Slovene. Today there are only a few speakers left in Slovenia and around the world.\n\nGottscheerish belongs to Southern Bavarian within the Bavarian dialect group. The Bavarian dialects of Carinthia are closest to it. Gottscheerish shares a lot of properties with the Bavarian dialects of the German language islands of the eastern Alps, among them Cimbrian in Veneto, Sappada (Pladen), and Timau (Tischelwang) in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and Sorica (Zarz) in Upper Carniola (Slovenia).\n\nGottscheerish developed independently for more than 600 years from the settlement of the first German-speaking settlers from Eastern Tyrol and Western Carinthia around 1330.\n\nThe Gottscheer Germans used Gottscheerish as oral language for daily communication, whereas their written language was Standard German. However, folk songs and folk tales collected in the 19th and 20th century have been published in Gottscheerish.\n\nAlready in the 19th century many speakers of Gottscheerish left their homes to emigrate to the United States. After resettlement of most Gottscheers by the German occupation forces in 1941 during the Second World War only a few hundred speakers of Gottscheerish remained in their homeland. After the war Gottscheerish was forbidden in Yugoslavia.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO, Gottscheerish is a \"critically endangered language\". The majority of its speakers live in the U.S., with a significant community in Queens, New York City. Most of them are of the oldest generation, who spent their childhood in Gottschee County. There are speakers in Canada, Austria and Germany as well, but just as in the U.S. they have hardly any opportunity to practice it. Everyday language in the family and elsewhere is English and German or the local dialect, respectively.\n\nIn Slovenia there are some families who preserved Gottscheerish in spite of the ban after World War II. Today, however, there are probably no more children learning it as first language. Most Gottscheerish speakers live in Moschnitze valley (Črmošnjiško-Poljanska dolina) between Kočevske Poljane and Črmošnjice, where some Gottscheer families collaborated with the partisan movement and therefore were allowed to stay.\n\nAs a primarily or exclusively spoken language, the written representation of Gottscheerish has varied considerably. The following table shows how some of the more problematic phonemes have been represented in different writing systems.\n\nThe symbol \"ə\" for schwa is frequently distorted in representations of Gottscheerish, incorrectly replaced by the partial differential symbol ∂ or umlauted \"ä\".\n\nThe phonological inventory of Gottscheerish differs from standard German in a number of ways, especially regarding palatal consonants. The phonological inventory here is based on Hans Tschinkel's 1908 grammar. Tschinkel does not explicitly distinguish between phonemic and phonetic status.\n\nConsonants in parentheses are either phonetic/positional variants, idiolect variants, or dialect variants.\n\nIn the westernmost part of Gottschee, known as the Suchen Plateau (), the phonemes /s/ and /ʃ/ merged to yield /ɕ/ and the phonemes /z/ and /ʒ/ merged to yield /ʑ/. The phoneme /r/ is rarely realized as [ʁ].

{"id": "26603129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26603129", "title": "Hispania (journal)", "text": "Hispania (journal)\n\nHispania is a peer-reviewed academic journal and the official journal of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese. It is published quarterly by the AATSP and covers Spanish and Portuguese literature, linguistics, and pedagogy. \"Hispania\" publishes in literature, linguistics, and pedagogy having to do with Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking communities, as well as book/media reviews, which are subdivided into Pan-Hispanic/Luso-Brazilian Literary and Cultural Studies, linguistics, language, media, and fiction and film.\n\nThe first publication of \"Hispania\" dates to the earliest days of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese and the first issue featured a summation of the possibilities of the new organization, written by Lawrence Wilkins, as well as an outline of future plans for the journal written by its founding editor in chief, Aurelio M. Espinosa (Stanford University). In the outline, Espinosa defined the journal's chief aim as \"the betterment of the teaching of Spanish in our schools and colleges\". Accordingly, \"Hispania\"'s original subtitle was \"A Journal Devoted to the Interests of Teachers of Spanish,\" which reflected the earnest pedagogic tone and content of its first volumes. In keeping with his vision of the journal's purpose, Espinosa published more pedagogical material than any of his successors: fully 64 percent of the articles in the nine volumes he edited were pedagogical in nature.\n\nAlfred Coester succeeded Espinosa as editor, a position he held for the next 14 years. During his tenure the journal grew significantly in scope and readership, adding new sections, such as the \"Professional Literature\" section devoted to reviewing pedagogical articles and books. In 1941, a report of the Committee on General Policies led to a revision of \"Hispania\"'s scope by recommending among others that its \"contents should strike a balance between material of interest to secondary teachers and articles primarily of interest to university members\". Further revisions called for more articles on Spanish in elementary schools, on relations with Hispanic America, and on attitudes of personal educators toward the teaching of Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nHenry Grattan Doyle succeeded Coester in 1942. Doyle had been editor of the \"Modern Language Journal\" for four years before he became editor of \"Hispania\". Doyle instituted the anonymous peer review process that is still in place today. He also increased the number of articles dealing with Luso-Brazilian languages and literatures. Other additions Doyle made to the editorial process included assigning books for review and ceasing to accept unsolicited reviews.\n\nThe post World War II era was ushered in with a new editor, Donald Walsh, in 1949. Walsh is considered by many, including his successor, Robert Mead Jr., to have developed \"Hispania\" into the modern language journal it is today. Walsh broke with the previous editors' focus on pedagogy by broadening \"Hispania\"'s scope, diversifying its contents, adding new sections, soliciting contributions from colleagues known for their expertise, and making sure that every issue of the journal had something of practical use and pedagogical value to both the K-12 teacher and the graduate-level professor. Walsh also instituted the change to a two-column format, which saved the journal space and money. He retired from the editorship in 1957.\n\nRobert Meade, Jr. (University of Connecticut) became interim editor in 1958, having already served since 1953 as an associate editor. Meade reiterated the message that articles must be broad enough in scope to interest the more than 5,000 members, nearly half of whom taught in secondary schools. Meade served during a time of rapid growth within the profession due to increased interest in foreign language study as well as increased funding through the National Defense Education Act (instituted to keep pace with the former USSR in mathematics, science, and foreign languages). Meade's editorial leadership increased the number of literary articles published in order to rectify an imbalance between the various sections.\n\nSeymour Menton (University of Kansas) succeeded Meade in 1963. During his three-year tenure as editor, Menton also strove to rectify an imbalance in the journal's article ratio by calling for more literary contributions from members. He created a second book review section that focused on reviewing books of scholarly and literary interest, as opposed to the original one, which focused on textbook reviews.\n\nIrving P. Rothberg, who had edited the book review section for nearly nine years prior, succeeded Menton in 1966 and served until 1974. He was in turn succeeded by Donald W. Bleznick, who instituted the inclusion of an editorial policy in each number of \"Hispania\" outlining what the journal would and would not accept for publication, a move intended to reduce the number of unwanted submissions. Bleznick managed the journal during one of its most trying times, after a fire destroyed its printing facility in Appleton, Wisconsin in May 1979. He oversaw the reconstruction of the journal and found it a new publisher in time to have it in print again by 1980.\n\nTheodore A. Sackett became editor in 1984 and directed the journal through most the 1980s. Sackett added \"Pedagogy\" as a special section in \"Hispania\" in order to address the changing face of the classroom that resulted from the advent of computers and the new concern for communicative competence. He was succeeded by Estelle Irizarry in 1993. During her editorship, \"Hispania\" became the first journal in the humanities to digitalize and produce a CD of articles dating from its inception in 1917 through 1990, a project for which members volunteered to prepare issues or volumes. Irizarry also improved efficiency and reduced decision time. Under her tenure, the journal was awarded second place for the \"Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement\" from the Council of Editors of Learned Journals in 1995.\n\nJanet Pérez assumed the editorship in 2000. Her final term ended in 2009. The end of her editorship coincided with her induction as a permanent member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language at a ceremony at the Instituto Cervantes in New York City.\n\nSheri Spaine Long, the former editor of \"Foreign Language Annals\", succeeded Pérez as Editor in January 2010. Concurrently, Johns Hopkins University Press became the publisher of the journal. Long’s editorship ended in 2018.\n\nBenjamin Fraser began as Editor of the journal in 2018. \n\nThe journal is abstracted and indexed in Current Contents, EBSCOhost, FRANCIS, Hispanic American Periodicals Index, International Bibliography of Periodical Literature in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, and Russian Academy of Sciences Bibliographies.\n\n"}

For a decade he served as a member of the national representative body of Jamat-e-Islami Hind in Delhi. Saeed was one of founders of Shanthi Prakashana and later he became chairman of this publishing house.\n\nSaeed is known to the people of Karnataka state not merely as a journalist but also as a thinker, an intellectual and a scholar. He was an orator who traveled widely in Karnataka giving lectures on various topics including communal harmony, character building and moral values, as well as the significance of democracy in India. Da’wah is another field he had taken up to his heart during his lifetime and had composed several Da’wah related books. Plenty of his Kannada and Urdu speeches have come out in form of audio cassettes as well. He did voice recording for the first ever Kannada translation of the Qur’an in electronic format. The multilingual Saeed is fluent in Kannada, Urdu and English. He has studied Arabic and Malayalam languages privately. He used to hold his weekly Qur'an discourse sessions in Kannada and also in Beary bashe, a dialect used by the Indian Beary community live alongside coastal Karnataka.\n\nSaeed firmly believed that most of the mistrust between the followers of Islam and of other religions springs from the lack of knowledge about each other’s faith. He was a student of comparative religions and tried to remove mistrust and bring people of various religions closer through his translations, writings and speeches.\n\nOne work, \"Tappu kalpanegalu\", was reprinted nine times. It earned him prominence in the neighboring states of Karnataka when it was translated into English, Marathi and Tamil. He had also rendered services as chairman of Shanti Prakashana, a publishing company based in Mangalore city.\n\nHis work \"Mahakavi Iqbalara kavanagalu\" is an attempt to transform thoughts and philosophy of Allama Iqbal into Kannada language which he had started to pen down in his popular weekly, \"Sanmarga\". Shanti Prakashana, of which he was chairman, later brought it out in book form. This is the first major work in Kannada as regard to Sir Allama Iqbal’s poetry or philosophy is concerned.\n\nIbrahim Saeed also served on the translation board of \"Divya Qur’an\" and \"Qur’an Vyakhyana\". The former is a translation and the latter is commentary (Tafsir) work of the Qur’an in Kannada. \"Qur’an Vyakhyana\" is an abridged version of Towards Understanding the Qur'an, the renowned Qur’an exegesis. He has enormously contributed to bring out Kannada Translation of Qur'an in audio cassettes and later in CD form.\n\n\"Pravadi Jeevana Sandesha\" is a biography of Muhammad with proper citations and reference sources.\n\nIbrahim Saeed was a columnist in \"Prajavani\", the largest published Kannada daily of Karnataka. In Prajavani he wrote under nom de plume \"Sanmargi.\".\n\nIbrahim Saeed died at the age of 62 on 27 May 2007 at Unity Health Complex, a private healthcare centre in Mangalore. He had been admitted to the hospital only the previous night. He left behind four sons and four daughters.\n\nSaeed's funeral was attended by a large number of people in the city of Mangalore. Chief minister of Karnataka state H. D. Kumaraswamy, former chief minister Dharam Singh have visited Saeed’s house in Kankanady. State opposition leader Mallikarjun Kharge, former central minister C.

Her literary career began in late 1950s when she started to write short stories and publish them in the leading newspaper of the country including the \"Azad\". She continues to write defying her age and broken health.\n\nIffat Ara was born to Maulavi Quazi Abdul Hakim and Mosammat Hajera Khatun in Mymensingh town in 1939. She struggled hard for formal education, first learning Arabic at home to be able to read the Quran. She then went to Muslim Girls' School for primary education. After her primary education was over, her father withdrew her from the school since, at that time, higher education for girls was not considered necessary. Desperate to continue education, she threatened to commit suicide and was subsequently admitted to the Vidyamoyee Govt. Girls' High School of the town. But before she could complete the high school she was married to Abdul Latif Talukder, a young lawyer and politician. Luckily it was a short interruption and she could appear in the Matriculate examination the next year. Later, she passed Intermediate from the Muminunnesa Women's College. In 1966 she graduated from the same college and proceeded to study for B. Ed. at the Mymensingh Women's Teachers Training College. When Ananda Mohan College was upgraded to a university-college, Iffat Ara lost no time to get admitted for her Masters in Bengali language and literature.\n\nTo her, life is work, work is life. She believes in women freedom but does not think marriage is a stumbling block on the way. She is religious and believes that Islam does not stand on the way for Muslim women to live a modern life. A very hospitable lady, Iffat Ara is near and dear to many in Mymensingh. She has mothered three children with utmost care and success. At her residence in Mymensingh town, she passes her time through writing, gardening and entertaining young authors and literary workers.\n\nWomen's movements in Mymensingh could not be thought of without the active presence of Iffat Ara since the 1960s. She became involved in social welfare activities for women with her membership of All Pakistan Women's Association in 1966. After birth of Bangladesh in 1971, she, in association with others like author Helena Khan, Sufia Karim and politician Mariam Hashimuddin took initiative to set up \"Mahila Samity\" (tr. Women's Association). Later she organized the Mymensingh chapter of the Bangladesh Jatiyo Mahila Sangtha, an organization sponsored by the government. She contributed substantially in establishing Udayan High School in Mymensingh in 1988. Since her marriage she was in touch with politics but never opted for joining politics.\n\nIn 1968, Iffat Ara joined Nasirabad Girls' School as an assistant teacher and retired from there as its headmistress in 1972. Later she took up the job of feature editor for the women's page of the weekly \"Banglar Darpan\" published from Mymensingh. When the same establishment started to publish a monthly women's magazine, titled \"Chandrakash\", in 1973, Iffat Ara was appointed its editor. She worked as editor of \"Chandrakash\" till 1979.\n\nIffat Ara has published nine titles to her credit. They include novels, a collection of short stories, a book of knowledge for children and essays. She also edited \"Bangladesher Jonopriyo Kavita\" (tr. Popular poems from Bangladesh), a collection of Bengali poems since the late 18th century. Her unique book of knowledge for high school goers \"Shona achey jana nai\" was highly acclaimed and has gone through many editions since 1990. Her novel \"Sukh jakhan shesh belay\" was published in 2000. Currently she is working on a book of short stories for young readers.\n\nShe set up a press in her house and started to publish a literary monthly magazine \"Chinta\" in 1986. Later it was renamed \"Dwitiyo Chinta\" in 1988. Soon \"Iffat Mansion\", her residence in Mymensingh town since 1960, from where she published her magazine, became a hub of literary activities. The poet Jibanananda Das birth centenary edition of the \"Dwitiyo Chinta\", brought out in 1999, remains an example of high quality editing and planning of a commemorative issue of a magazine. \"Dwitiyo Chinta\" has published writings of many eminent writers and poets of the country in addition to regional writers.\n"}

There is a duty on all patent applicants to disclose relevant art or background information that the applicant is aware of and that may be relevant to the patentability of the applicant's invention, as established by the United States Code title 35 and related sections of 37 CFR and the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP). If a patent applicant, with deceptive intent for art known to the applicant, fails to submit material prior art to the USPTO, then any patent that later issues from the patent application may be declared unenforceable because of inequitable conduct. Furthermore, the duty to submit such relevant information to the USPTO lies not only on the applicant or inventor, but also on any patent attorney or other legal staff employed by the applicant.\n\nArt listed on an IDS, on its own, is not automatically considered prior art. \"Mere listing of a reference in an information disclosure statement is not taken as an admission that the reference is prior art against the claims.\"\n\nThe information submitted in an IDS typically includes other issued patents, published patent applications, scientific journal articles, books, magazine articles, or any other published material that is relevant to the invention disclosed in the applicant's own patent application, irrespective of the country or language in which the published material was made.\n\nArt listed on an IDS is typically broken up into three categories: U.S. patent literature, foreign patent literature, and non-patent literature (NPL). US patent literature consists of issued U.S. patents and U.S. patent application publications. Copies of listed U.S. patent literature do not need to be submitted along with the IDS as USPTO examiners have access to all U.S. patent literature. Foreign patent literature consists of patents issued in foreign countries, foreign application publications if they exist, and PCT international application publications. Non-patent literature consists of any publication that is not a U.S. or foreign patent publication, such as magazine articles or research journals. Copies of listed non-patent literature (NPL) and foreign patent publications need to be submitted along with the IDS or they will not be considered by USPTO examiners. If the copies of NPL or foreign patent publications are not in the English language, the applicant must also submit an English translation or a summary of relevancy in the English language in order for the piece of art to be considered by the examiner.\n\nThe content requirements of an IDS are defined in 37 CFR 1.98, which can be found in the MPEP.\n\nThe submission requirements of an IDS are defined in 37 CFR 1.97, also found in the MPEP, and include when and how the applicant is allowed to submit information disclosure statements.

{"id": "996289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=996289", "title": "Jämtland dialects", "text": "Jämtland dialects\n\nJämtland dialects (\"jamska\" , Swedish: \"jämtska\") constitute a group of closely related dialects spoken in the Swedish province of Jämtland. They are commonly used in the entire region, with the exception of Frostviken in the northernmost part of the province, where the local dialect is of trøndersk origin, due to its later settlement from Norway. In the eastern part of Jämtland the dialects are transitional to those of Ångermanland. The dialect group is commonly regarded and treated as a single entity. Some people consider it a language separate from Swedish. \n\nJamtlandic shares many characteristics with both Trøndersk—the dialect spoken in Trøndelag, Norway—and with the dialects spoken along the coast of Norrland, Sweden. Due to this ambiguous position, there has been a debate since the early 20th century whether Jamtlandic belongs to the West Norse or the East Norse language group. Jamtlandic cannot be uniquely defined belonging to either of these groups. Prior to, and around, the time of the dissolution of the Swedish–Norwegian union, Jamtlandic was undisputedly considered a dialect of Norwegian. See, e.g., p. 112 in part one of Adolf Noreen's \"Vårt språk\" (translated from Swedish):\n\nThe local name for the dialects is \"jamska\", whose literal equivalent in English would be \"Jamtish\" or \"Jämtish\". There is, however, no common term for the dialects in English, and academic sources call them by various names, such as \"jamska\", \"jämtska\", \"Jämtish dialect\", \"Jämtlandic dialect\", \"Jämtland dialects\" or \"dialects of Jämtland\".\n\nThe endonym \"jamska\" is technically a definite form; the indefinite form \"jaamsk/jamske\" is rarely used.\n\nSince the early 20th century, whether Jamtlandic is a dialect or a language has been hotly debated. Proponents of Jamtlandic as a language point to the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation. A great percentage of the Jamtish speakers recognise Jamtish as a language rather than a Swedish dialect. There have been efforts to make the Swedish government recognise it as a minority language just as Yiddish and Sami. One of the more prominent people that have been active in the effort to make Jamtish a recognised language is Bo Oscarsson. Oscarsson has written books about the Jamtish language/dialect and even compiled dictionaries.\n\nAccording to the sagas, the region called Jämtland was originally settled by fugitives from Trøndelag after Harald Fairhair united Norway in the 9th century. It became part of Norway during the reign of Haakon I in the 10th century and remained part of Norway until the 17th century. At that point it became part of Sweden. The history of the region accounts for many of the dialect's features.\n\nIt is difficult to the trace the history of Jamtlandic dialects because written sources only exist from the early 18th century, if not including the early 11th century Frösö runestone or the 14th century legal documents which can not be confirmed to have been written in Old Jamtlandic, the assumed distinct Jamtlandic dialect of Old West Norse.\n\nThere have been attempts to standardize the orthography of Jamtlandic. The attempt that has been the most popular is \"Vägledning för stavning av jamska\" (1994 and 1995) which is the work of the committee \"Akademien för jamska\" consisting of Bodil Bergner, Berta Magnusson and Bo Oscarsson. The most prominent application of this orthography has been to prepare translations of parts of the Bible into Jamtlandic resulting in the book \"Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska\". An excerpt:\n\nGenesis 1:26–27:\n\nIt should be emphasized that the book does not fully follow \"Vägledning för stavning av jamska\". For example, using \"Vägledning för stavning av jamska\" one would spell \"gjæra\" v. 'do; make', not \"gjära\". Another spelling convention in \"Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska\" is the use of the digraph \"sh\", in e.g. \"mänish\" n. 'human being' and \"fishn\" n. 'the fish', with the same pronunciation as English 'sh' in 'shoe'. Properly using \"Vägledning för stavning av jamska\", this would be spelled \"sch\"; see § 26 in the external link below.\n\nJamtlandic uses the letters of the Swedish alphabet, with the addition of æ and ô. The letters c, q, w, x, and z are not used in the Jamtlandic alphabet.\n\n\n"}

He developed a philosophy of dialogue, in connection with the pragmatic theory of action of the Erlangen constructivist school. Lorenz is married to the literary scholar Karin Lorenz-Lindemann.\n\nAfter studying mathematics and physics in Tübingen, Hamburg, Bonn and Princeton, Lorenz earned his Ph.D. in 1961 under Paul Lorenzen in Kiel with a thesis about \"Arithmetic and Logic as Games\". In 1969 he received his habilitation degree in philosophy also under Lorenzen but this time in Erlangen. In 1970 he was offered the chair of philosophy at the University of Hamburg to succeed Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. From 1974 till his retirement in 1997 he taught at the University of Saarland in Saarbrücken. Among his former students is Arno Ros.\n\nLorenz developed (along with Paul Lorenzen) an approach to arithmetic and logic as dialogue games. In dialogical logic (game semantics), tree calculations (generally, of Gentzen type calculus) are written upside down, so that the initial assertion of a proponent stays above and is defended against an opponent as in a game. This is a linguistically more congenial approach to logic which is more suitable as a model for argumentation than the formal derivation in a calculus or truth tables. Lorenz presented for the first time a simple demonstration of Gentzen's consistency proof on this game-theoretic basis. If one regards logic and mathematics in this way as a game, an intuitionist approach becomes a more plausible option.\n\nNot only logic, but the whole of philosophy is given a dialogical treatment by Lorenz. Only in the mirror of a relative Other is it possible to reflect upon oneself. Lorenz developed a dialogical constructivism from the focus on the dialogical principle (Martin Buber) and the process of language games of the later Ludwig Wittgenstein. In addition, the pragmatism of Charles Sanders Peirce and the historicism of Wilhelm Dilthey are complementary juxtaposed.\n\n\n\n"}

It includes the nation's official languages, its national and regional languages, as well as its minority and foreign languages.\n\nThere are 88 individual languages of Ethiopia according to Ethnologue, with the 1994 Ethiopian census indicating that some 77 tongues were spoken locally. Most of these languages belong to the Afroasiatic family (Semitic and Cushitic languages; Omotic languages are also spoken, though their classification is uncertain). Additionally, Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by what the government calls the \"Nilotic\" people, though scholars distinguish Nilotic from the Surmic languages, Gumuz languages, and Koman languages and spoken in Ethiopia.\n\nOf the languages spoken in Ethiopia, 86 are living and 2 are extinct. 41 of the living languages are institutional, 14 are developing, 18 are vigorous, 8 are in danger of extinction, and 5 are near extinction.\n\nCharles A. Ferguson proposed the Ethiopian language area, characterized by shared grammatical and phonological features in 1976. This \"sprachbund\" includes the Afroasiatic languages of Ethiopia, not the Nilo-Saharan languages. In 2000, Mauro Tosco questioned the validity of Ferguson's original proposal. There is still no agreement among scholars on this point, but Tosco has at least weakened Ferguson's original claim.\n\nEnglish is the most widely spoken foreign language and is the medium of instruction in secondary schools and universities. Amharic was the language of primary school instruction but has been replaced in many areas by local languages such as Oromo and Tigrinya.\n\nAfter the fall of the Derg in 1991, the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia granted all ethnic groups the right to develop their languages and to establish first language primary education systems. This is a marked change to the language policies of previous governments in Ethiopia.\n\nIn terms of writing systems, Ethiopia's principal orthography is the Ge'ez script. Employed as an abugida for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the sixth and fifth centuries BC as an abjad to transcribe the Semitic Ge'ez language. Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches. Other writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. These include Arabic script for writing some Ethiopian languages spoken by Muslim populations and Sheikh Bakri Sapalo's script for Oromo. Today, many Cushitic, Omotic, and Nilo-Saharan languages are written in Roman/Latin script.\n\nAccording to the 2007 Ethiopian census, the largest first languages are: Amharic 21,634,396 or 29.30%; Oromo language 24,930,424 speakers or 33.80% of the total population Somali 4,609,274 or 6.25%; Tigrinya 4,324,476 or 5.86% Sidamo 2,981,471 or 4.84% Wolaytta 1,627,784 or 2.21%; Gurage 1,481,783 or 2.01% and Afar 1,281,278 or 1.74%. Arabic, which also belongs to the Afroasiatic family, is likewise spoken in some areas of Ethiopia. Many Muslim Ethiopians are also able to speak Arabic because of their religious background. English is the most widely spoken foreign language which is also taught in many schools. Amharic is the official working language in which all federal laws are published, and it is spoken by millions of Ethiopians as a second language. In most regions it is the primary second language in the school curriculum.\n\nAfroasiatic\n\nIn Ethiopia, the term \"Nilotic\" is often used to refer to Nilo-Saharan languages and their communities. However, in academic linguistics, \"Nilotic\" is only part of \"Nilo-Saharan\", a segment of the larger Nilo-Saharan family.\nNilo-Saharan\n\n\nA number of Ethiopian languages are endangered: they may not be spoken in one or two generations and may become extinct, victims of language death, as Weyto, Gafat, and Mesmes have and Ongota very soon will. The factors that contribute to language death are complex, so it is not easy to estimate which or how many languages are most vulnerable. Hudson wrote, \"Assuming that a language with fewer than 10,000 speakers is endangered, or likely to become extinct within a generation\", there are 22 endangered languages in Ethiopia (1999:96). However, a number of Ethiopian languages never have had populations even that high, so it is not clear that this is an appropriate way to calculate the number of endangered languages in Ethiopia. The real number may be lower or higher. The new language policies after the 1991 revolution have strengthened the use of a number of languages. Publications specifically about endangered languages in Ethiopia include: Appleyard (1998), Hayward (1988), Zelealem (1998a,b, 2004)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4521127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4521127", "title": "Middle Indo-Aryan languages", "text": "Middle Indo-Aryan languages\n\nThe Middle Indo-Aryan languages (or Middle Indic languages, sometimes conflated with the Prakrits, which are a stage of Middle Indic) are a historical group of languages of the Indo-Aryan family. They are the descendants of Old Indo-Aryan (attested in Vedic Sanskrit) and the predecessors of the modern Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), Odia, Bengali and Punjabi.\n\nThe Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) stage in the evolution of Indo-Aryan languages is thought to have spanned more than a millennium between 600 BCE and 1000 CE, and is often divided into three major subdivisions.\n\n\nThe Indo-Aryan languages are commonly assigned to three major groups - Old Indo-Aryan languages, Middle Indo-Aryan languages and Early Modern and Modern Indo-Aryan languages. The classification reflects stages in linguistic development, rather than being strictly chronological.\n\nThe Middle Indo-Aryan languages are younger than the Old Indo-Aryan languages but were contemporaneous with the use of Classical Sanskrit, an Old Indo-Aryan language used for literary purposes.\n\nAccording to Thomas Oberlies, a number of morphophonological and lexical features of Middle Indo-Aryan languages show that they are not direct continuations of Vedic Sanskrit. Instead they descend from other dialects similar to, but in some ways more archaic than Vedic Sanskrit.\n\n\n\n\nA Middle Indo-Aryan innovation are the serial verb constructions that have evolved into complex predicates in modern north Indian languages such as Hindi and Bengali. For example, भाग जा (bhāg jā) 'go run' means run away, पका ले (pakā le) 'take cook' means to cook for oneself, and पका दे (pakā de) 'give cook' means to cook for someone. The second verb restricts the meaning of the main verb or adds a shade of meaning to it. Subsequently, the second verb was grammaticalised further into what is known as a light verb,\nmainly used to convey lexical aspect distinctions for the main verb. The innovation is based on Sanskrit atmanepadi (fruit of the action accrues to the doer) and parasmaipadi verbs (fruit of the action accrues to some other than the doer). For example, पका दे (pakā de) 'give cook' has the result of the action (cooked food) going to someone else, and पका ले (pakā le) 'take cook' to the one who is doing the cooking.\n\nPali is the best attested of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages because of the extensive writings of early Buddhists. These include canonical texts, canonical developments such as Abhidhamma, and a thriving commentarial tradition associated with figures such as Buddhaghosa. Early Pāli texts, such as the Sutta-nipāta contain many \"Magadhisms\" (such as \"heke\" for \"eke\"; or masculine nominative singular in \"-e\"). Pāli continued to be a living second language until well into the second millennium. The Pali Text Society was founded in 1881 by T. W. Rhys Davids to preserve, edit, and publish texts in Pāli, as well as English translations.\n\nKnown from a few inscriptions, most importantly the pillars and edicts of Ashoka found in what is now Bihar.\n\nMany texts in Kharoṣṭhi script have been discovered in the area centred on the Khyber Pass in what was known in ancient times as Gandhara and the language of the texts came to be called Gāndhārī. These are largely Buddhist texts which parallel the Pāli Canon, but include Mahāyāna texts as well. The language is distinct from other MI dialects.\n\nAn apabhramsa (also: avahatta) was a language developed from Prakrits. Modern Provincial languages developed from different apabhramsas. Patanjali was the first to use the term apabhramsa in his Mahabhasya (200 BC). The term is derived from the Sanskrit word Apabhrasta, and means a corrupted form of Sanskrit. Mostly Jain religious language and spiritual literature of Siddhas was composed in Apabhramsa language. When the Romani people migrated from Rajasthan, Punjab, Sindh and Afghanistan in the 1st century AD, they were speaking an apabhramsa language pertaining to the Western part of India. They spread to Western countries around the 12th century AD.\n\nLiterary work in apabhramsa appeared in 8th century AD. Poets of apabhramsa are as follows:\n\n"}

She never learned English, but was trilingual in Natchez, Cherokee and Creek.\n\nIn 1907 she worked a little with anthropologist John R. Swanton who collected information about Natchez religion, and in the 1930s she worked extensively with linguist Mary Haas who collected grammatical information and texts using an interpreter.

Sometimes she used the surname Taylor, which she had taken from her second husband.\n\nShe married four times; she had one son Adam Levi from her first marriage, with her second husband Will Taylor she received land allotments from the Dawes Commission in 1907. She was soon widowed, then married a man named Waters, and by 1920 was again widowed and married Albert Raven about whom little is known. In the 1930s she appears to have been once again widowed. In 1930 she sold her land allotment. She was the biological cousin of the other last speaker of Natchez, Watt Sam, who in Natchez kinship terminology was her classificatory nephew.

The term is used to distinguish such wine from organic wine and biodynamic wine because of differences in cellar practices. All natural wines are, however, farmed organically at a minimum and many growers are biodynamic in the vineyard as well.\n\nStrictly speaking, natural wines are wines that are produced without adding or removing anything during winemaking, although some growers add tiny quantities of sulphites at bottling, so that strictly speaking their wines are not natural wines, but 'only' organic (and possibly biodynamic).\n\nOrganic wine is organic in the sense of having been produced from organically grown grapes, but may be subject to chemical and physical manipulation in the winemaking process.\n\nAmong the most influential personalities and ambassadors for natural wines is worth mentioning sommeliers like Pierre Jancou (La Crémerie, Le bistrot Racines, Vivant and Heimat) and Ewen Le Moigne (Saturne) from Paris and Anders Frederik Steen (He worked as sommelier at the world-famous restaurant Noma, then joined Noma alums to form the highly acclaimed restaurant Relae and then Manfreds, both in Copenhagen.) Now Anders is a winemaker in Ardèche. Another influential name is Natural Wine World is Isabelle Legeron MW, France's only female Master of Wine and the only MW worldwide dedicated to the subject.\n\nAt the present time (2013) there exists no official or legal definition of natural wine; neither has any legislation been passed to date by any regional, national or supranational authority, and there are no organizations that can certify that a wine is natural.\n\nHowever, there are many unofficial definitions or codes of practice published by the different associations of natural wine producers:\n\n\nAdditionally, many articles have been written defining what is or is not natural wine given that there is no clear consensus or definition on the topic as of yet.\n\nThe following basic criteria are generally accepted by most natural wine producers and organizations:\n\nThe following people were or are instrumental in the production or communication of contemporary natural wine:\n\n\nThe term \"Natural wine\" is considered by some critics, such as Tom Wark, to be a misleading term. There is no established certification body and the term has no legal status. Winemakers who describe themselves (or are described by others) as \"natural\" often differ in what they consider to be an acceptable level of intervention. The term might also confuse consumers into assuming that the wine is organically grown.\n\nThe inherent ambiguity of the term has been defended by Bradford Taylor, owner of Ordinaire, a wine bar in Oakland, California that exclusively serves natural wine. According to Taylor, \"there's something productive about how nebulous the term 'natural' is, how it opens itself up to debate every time it comes up.\"\n\n\n"}

For instance in child language testing, examples of such words include \"wug\" and \"blicket\".\n\nThe term is used because such a word is created \"for the nonce\". All nonce words are also neologisms. The term \"nonce word\" was apparently the creation of James Murray, the influential editor of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\n\nNonce words are sometimes used to study the development of language in children because they allow researchers to test how children treat words of which they have no prior knowledge. This permits inferences about the default assumptions children make about new word meanings, syntactic structure, etc. \"Wug\" is among the earliest known nonce words used in language learning studies, and is best known for its use in Jean Berko's \"Wug test\", in which children were presented with a novel object, called a wug, and then shown multiple instances of the object and asked to complete a sentence that elicits a plural form—e.g., \"This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There are two...?\" The use of the plural form \"wugs\" by the child suggests that they have applied a plural rule to the form, and that this knowledge is not specific to prior experience with the word but applies to all nouns, whether familiar or novel.\n\nA poem by Seamus Heaney entitled \"Nonce Words\" is included in his collection \"District and Circle\".\n\nOther examples of nonce words include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23654", "title": "Play-by-mail game", "text": "Play-by-mail game\n\nPlay-by-mail games, or play-by-post games, are games, of any type, played through postal mail or email.\n\nCorrespondence chess has been played by mail for centuries. The boardgame \"Diplomacy\" has been played by mail since the 1960s, starting with a printed newsletter (a fanzine) written by John Boardman. More complex games, moderated entirely or partially by computer programs, were pioneered by Rick Loomis of Flying Buffalo in 1970. The first such game offered via major email services was \"WebWar II\" (based on Starweb and licensed from Flying Buffalo) from Neolithic Enterprises who accepted email turns from all of the major email services including CompuServe in 1983.\n\nPlay by mail games are often referred to as PBM games, and play by email is sometimes abbreviated PBeM—as opposed to face to face (FTF) or over the board (OTB) games which are played in person. Another variation on the name is play-by-Internet (PBI) or play-by-web (PBW). In all of these examples, player instructions can be either executed by a human moderator, a computer program, or a combination of the two.\n\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail games reached their peak of popularity with the advent of \"Gaming Universal\", \"Paper Mayhem\" and \"Flagship magazine\", the first professional magazines devoted to play-by-mail games. (An earlier fanzine, \"The Nuts & Bolts of PBM\", was the first publication to exclusively cover the hobby.) Bob McLain, the publisher and editor of Gaming Universal, further popularized the hobby by writing articles that appeared in many of the leading mainstream gaming magazines of the time. Flagship later bought overseas right to Gaming Universal, making it the leading magazine in the field. \"Flagship magazine\" was founded by Chris Harvey and Nick Palmer. The magazine still exists, under a new editor, but health concerns have led to worries over the publication's long term viability.\n\nIn the late 1990s, computer and Internet games marginalized play-by-mail conducted by actual postal mail, but the postal hobby still exists with an estimated 2000–3000 adherents worldwide.\n\nPostal gaming developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other. It was especially useful for those living in isolated areas and those whose tastes in games were uncommon.\n\nIn the case of a two player game such as chess, players would simply send their moves to each other alternately. In the case of a multi-player game such as Diplomacy, a central game master would run the game, receiving the moves and publishing adjudications. Such adjudications were often published in postal game zines, some of which contained far more than just games.\n\nThe commercial market for play-by-mail games grew to involve computer servers set up to host potentially thousands of players at once. Players would typically be split up into parallel games in order to keep the number of players per game at a reasonable level, with new games starting as old games ended. A typical closed game session might involve one to two dozen players, although some games claimed to have as many as five hundred people simultaneously competing in the same game world. While the central company was responsible for feeding in moves and mailing the processed output back to players, players were also provided with the mailing addresses of others so that direct contact could be made and negotiations performed. With turns being processed every few weeks (a two-week turnaround being standard), more advanced games could last over a year.\n\nGame themes are heavily varied, and may range from those based on historical or real events to those taking place in alternate or fictional worlds.\n\nOne of the most successful and longest running PBM games is TribeNet, a strategy game with themes of exploration, trade and warfare. TribeNet was launched by Jeff Perkins as a PBM in 1985 and was transformed by Peter Rzechorzek into a PBeM when he took over the game in 1997. Peter has remained in charge for over twenty years. \n\nThe onset of the computer-moderated PBM game (primarily the \"Legends\" game system) inevitably meant that the human moderated games became \"boutique\" games with little chance of matching the gross revenues that larger, automated games could produce.\n\nThe mechanics of play-by-mail games require that players think and plan carefully before making moves. Because planned actions can typically only be submitted at a fixed maximum frequency (e.g., once every few days or every few weeks), the number of discrete actions is limited compared to real-time games. As a result, players are provided with a variety of resources to assist in turn planning, including game aids, maps, and results from previous turns. Using this material, planning a single turn may take a number of hours.\n\nActual move/turn submission is traditionally carried out by filling in a \"turn card\". This card has formatted entry areas where players enter their planned actions (using some form of encoding) for the upcoming turn. Players are limited to some finite number of actions, and in some cases must split their resources between these actions (so that additional actions make each less effective). The way the card is filled in often implies an ordering between each command, so that they are processed in-order, one after another. Once completed, the card is then mailed (or, in more modern times, emailed) to the game master, where it is either processed, or held until the next turn processing window begins.\n\nBy gathering turn cards from a number of players and processing them all at the same time, games can provide simultaneous actions for all players. However, for this same reason, co-ordination between players can be difficult to achieve. For example, player A might attempt to move to player B's current location to do something with (or to) player B, while player B might simultaneously attempt to move to player A's current location. As such, the output/results of the turn can differ significantly from the submitted plan. Whatever the results, they are mailed back to the player to be studied and used as the basis for the next turn (often along with a new blank turn card).\n\nWhile billing is sometimes done using a flat per-game rate (when the length of the game is known and finite), games more typically use a per-turn cost schedule. In such cases, each turn submitted depletes a pool of credit which must periodically be replenished in order to keep playing. Some games have multiple fee schedules, where players can pay more to perform advanced actions, or to take a greater number of actions in a turn.\n\nSome role-playing PBM games also include an element whereby the player may describe actions of their characters in a free text form. The effect and effectiveness of the action is then based on the judgement of the GM who may allow or partially allow the action. This gives the player more flexibility beyond the normal fixed actions at the cost of more complexity and, usually, expense.\n\nWith the rise of the Internet, email and websites have largely replaced postal gaming and postal games zines. Play-by-email (PBEM) games differ from popular online multiplayer games in that, for most computerized multiplayer games, the players have to be online at the same time - also known as synchronous play. With a play-by-mail game, the players can play whenever they choose, since responses need not be immediate; this is sometimes referred to as turn-based gaming and is common among browser-based games. Some video games can be played in turn-based mode: one player makes a move, declaring it by email, and then the turn passes to another player who to makes his or her move. Depending on the game, a PBEM Aide may be available as an alternative to describing the move with text. Such an aide generally consists of a picture of the board along with movable playing pieces, cards, etc. A player moves the pieces as desired and then can either save a static picture of the new game state, or a replay sequentially showing all changes that transpired during his turn, and send this to his opponent.\n\nSeveral non-commercial email games played on the Internet and BITNET predate these. Some cards games like poker can also be played by email using cryptography, such as with FXTOP.\n\nAn increasingly popular format for play-by-email games is play-by-web. As with play-by-email games the players are notified by email when it becomes their turn, but they must then return to the game's website to continue playing what is essentially a browser-based game. The main advantage of this is that the players can be presented with a graphical representation of the game and an interactive interface to guide them through their turn. Since the notifications only have to remind the players that it is their turn they can just as easily be sent via instant messaging.\n\nSome sites have extended this gaming style by allowing the players to see each other's actions as they are made. This allows for real time playing while everyone is online and active, or slower progress if not.\n\nIncreasingly, this format is being adopted by social and mobile games, often described using the term \"asynchronous multiplayer\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1188821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1188821", "title": "Povel Ramel", "text": "Povel Ramel\n\nBaron Povel Karl Henric Ramel (; 1 June 1922 – 5 June 2007) was a Swedish entertainer. Ramel was a singer, pianist, vaudeville artist, author and a novelty song composer. His style was characterized by imaginative wit, both verbal and musical. He took inspiration from US and UK 'crazy' style humor and created his own personal Swedish version, unusual combinations of lyrics and music, word play, pastiche and general unexpectedness. He wrote approximately 1700 songs, skits and monologues, and he is regarded as a legend and an institution in Swedish entertainment.\n\nPovel Ramel was born in Östermalm, Stockholm into an affluent noble family. His father, Karl Ramel, was a lawyer. At a young age, Ramel found a loving audience for his talents in the family nurses, maids and cooks, and also his parents. His family often went on extensive holidays, and on such an occasion, on a beach in Belgium, when Povel was two years old he stepped on a nail. With the wound infected Povel was not expected to survive, although he recovered, with a slight permanent injury.\n\nRamel's school-life was troubled. He cut classes, often going to Skansen, an open-air museum and zoo, favouring their monkey house. To avoid getting into trouble, Ramel told his teachers that he had lost his attendance book, thereby getting a new one, while showing his parents the old one, free from absence remarks. However, one day his father spotted Ramel visiting the monkey house. Subsequently, his father tried sending Ramel to various schools, but with little success.\n\nAt the age of 15, Ramel accompanied his parents on a car trip. There was a collision and Ramel's mother, Märta Tesch, died the following day in hospital. His father died a few months later.\n\nAfter his parents' death, Ramel was raised by his paternal aunt, who recognised his artistic potential. He went to art school, but his infatuation with painting did not last. However, he developed a love for playing the piano and for words, as he became inspired by musicians such as Bing Crosby, Fats Waller, British trumpeter Nat Gonella, Spike Jones and British dance band leader Harry Roy. Entering \"Aftonbladet\"'s talent hunt, Vi som vill opp in 1939, Ramel sang and \"yawned\" his own composition, \"En sömnig serenad\" (\"A Sleepy Serenade\"). By this time Ramel was already a prolific songwriter. His aunt wrote the lyrics to one of his songs, \"En vår utan dig\" (\"A Spring Without You\"), which he recorded. Ramel's lyrics are noted for their humor and dramatic wordplay. Musically he was able to adopt styles from most types of music for his own purposes.\n\nLater, when called to do his military service, his foot condition kept him out of active duty, and he was given an administrative role. When studying the military code, he learned that most everything was forbidden. But, with no rules to be found against Boogie Woogie Walzes, he dutifully wrote \"Johanssons boogie-woogie-vals\", the song that was later to become his first hit.\n\nSTIM (a musical copyright agency) required the record have a label banning its airplay. As a result, the sales were minimal. Then a friend at the record company sent a copy with the label pulled off to Radiotjänst (The Swedish Broadcasting Corporation), and the sales jumped. Ramel was hired by Radiotjänst in 1945, which ushered in a new era of radio entertainment. With several series of innovative radio shows featuring the crazy style of humor, he became a household name in Sweden.\n\nIn 1952 Ramel and Felix Alvo started the Knäppupp AB (Unbutton Inc.) company. The Knäppupp vaudeville shows were popular with Swedish audiences. His first vaudeville show was \"Akta Huvet\" (\"Mind Your Head\") and Ramel made his entrance hanging from a cable over the auditorium. The show opened at the \"Cirkus\" theatre in Gothenburg in 1952. Knäppupp AB also produced a number of movies, such as \"Ratataa\" in 1956. Ramel also had several pub shows such as, \"Karamelodier\". \"Karamelodier\" is one of Ramel's typical puns, as the word \"karamelodier\" is a combination of the words \"karamell\" (bon-bon), \"Ramel\" and \"melodier\" (melodies).\n\n\nRamel was not interested in political satire or in lampooning public figures, and only a few of his songs refer to current events. There are a few exceptions:\n\nIn 1983 Ramel founded \"Karamelodiktstipendiet\", a prize annually awarded to a Swedish entertainer or group of entertainers. It is intended for renewers of the Swedish language or related musical advances. The prize was presented by Ramel in Hagaparken in Stockholm. The name of the prize is a pun similar to the one described above, referring to \"karamell\" and Ramel; \"dikt\" means poem and \"stipendie\" scholarship. Thus the recipient is not only awarded a monetary prize, but also a bag of candy and a poem written by Ramel himself. After the ceremony everyone is offered fried pigeon, which most guests politely abstain from eating. The prize, according to the founder, is enough to make the recipient economically independent, at least for the rest of the day (it was 20.000 SEK until 2007 when it was increased to 25.000 SEK).\n\nThe 2007 ceremony was led by Ramel's children Mikael and Lotta, due to their father being confined to his home after heart surgery.\n\nHolders:\n\n\nPovel Ramel wrote a number of books, his first in 1945, though his main focus was always on his music.\nHere is a list of his books (not including the many book of lyrics that he published):\n\nIn this book, Ramel presents himself as an 'eternity-human', born in the ice age.\nHe describes the history of Sweden \"as it was\" from the old Norse \"Asar\"-gods to Gustav Vasa.\nHe also has some 'eternity-friends' and an 'eternity-dog' called Missräkningen (The miscalculation).\n\nRamel's pasture is said to have corners. 5 of them. It is a crazy pasture.\n\nThis book has sections, called corners. These are:\n\n\nThis book is about the time of Knäppupp. It came with a vinyl album with the same name, and is really hard to find today.\n\nThis is a lyric book with some famous songs (like Naturnbarn, and Johansson's boogie woogie vals) and some less well known songs by Ramel (As Balladen Om Kung Styggfrid {The Ballad about King Wickedfrid})\n\nWith sheet music to many of Ramel's most popular songs.\nThe title is also the title of one of Ramel's songs.\n\nThis includes some random poems and writings of Ramel, as \"How to Convince an American Businessman\"\n\n\n\"Vanliga palsternackan\" is a play on the famous Swedish almanac, Vanliga Almanackan (The ordinary almanac)\nIt includes some strange ideas such as a list of kings who died from overeating (with space to keep the list up-to-date)\nThis book was co-written with Hans Alfredson\n\nThis begins with Ramel's youth and ends when he married his wife in 1949.\nHe describes many things of his life, such as when he, as a child, cut big holes in his clothes, to find out what it was like to be poor!\nRamel choose to not call the book his 'memoarer' (memoirs), as that would sound too boring!\n\"Följ mej bakåt vägen\" is also a title of one of Ramel's songs.\n\nThis is a longer edition of Lingonben with some well-known and less well known unknown songs.\n\nIt has been reprinted many times, most recently in 1997.\n\nThis is Ramel's 'life-parts' part two, including the Knäppupp years, which includes a section from the book Knäppupplevelser.\n\nThis book includes a CD and sheet music to some new and some old songs about animals.\nespecially those poor animals that never had a song written about them, such as Acke Asgam (Acke Carrion Vulture), Gary Gråsugga (Gary Isopoda) and Tvigge Tvestjärt (Tvigge Earwig) who crawled far into grannie's ear.\n\nRamel is said to have almost completed this book.\n\n\nThe year of the opening is listed.

The domain name later was used for Quack, an iPad search application from AOL.\n\nIt was founded in 1998 by Steven Woods, Jeromy Carriere and Alex Quilici as a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, based voice portal infrastructure company named Quackware. Quack was the first company to try to create a voice portal: a consumer-based destination \"site\" in which consumers could not only access information by voice alone, but also complete transactions. Quackware launched a beta phone service in 1999 that allowed consumers to purchase books from sites such as Amazon and CDs from sites such as CDNow by answering a short set of questions. Quack followed with a set of information services from movie listings (inspired by, but expanding upon, Moviefone) to news, weather and stock quotes. This concept introduced a series of lookalike startups including Tellme Networks which raised more money than any Internet startup in history on a similar concept.\n\nQuack received venture funding in 1999 and moved operations to Mountain View in Silicon Valley, California in 1999. \nA deal with Lycos was announced in May 2000.\nIn September 2000 Quack was acquired for $200 million by America Online (AOL) and moved onto the Netscape campus with what was left of the Netscape team.\n\nQuack was attacked in the Canadian press for being representative of the Canadian \"brain drain\" to the US during the Internet bubble, focusing its recruiting efforts on the University of Waterloo, hiring more than 50 engineers from Waterloo in less than 10 months. Quack competitor Tellme Networks raised enormous funds in what became a highly competitive market in 2000, with the emergence of more than a dozen additional competitors in a 12-month period.\n\nFollowing its acquisition by America Online in an effort led by Ted Leonsis to bring Quack into AOL Interactive, the Quack voice service became AOLbyPhone as one of AOL's \"web properties\" along with MapQuest, Moviefone and others.\n\nQuack secured several patents that underlie the technical challenges of delivering interactive voice services. Constructing a voice portal required integrations and innovations not only in speech recognition and speech generation, but also in databases, application specification, constraint-based reasoning and artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. \"Quack\"'s name derived from the company goal of providing not only voice-based services, but more broadly \"Quick Ubiquitous Access to Consumer Knowledge\".\n\nThe patents assigned to Quack.com include: System and method for voice access to Internet-based information, System and method for advertising with an Internet Voice Portal and recognizing the axiom that in interactive voice systems one must \"know the set of possible answers to a question before asking it\". System and method for determining if one web site has the same information as another web site.\n\nQuack.com was spoofed in \"The Simpsons\" in March 2002 in the episode \"Blame It on Lisa\" in which a \"ComQuaak\" sign is replaced by another equally crazy telecom company name.\n\nIn July 2010, quack.com became the focus of a new AOL iPad application, that was a web search experience. The product delivers web results and blends in picture, video and Twitter results. It enables you to preview the web results before you go to the site, search within each result, and flip through the results pages, making full use of the iPad's touch screen features. The iPad app was free via iTunes, but support discontinued in 2012.\n\n"}

The concept was introduced by Vladimir Lenin in 1913, in his article \"Маёвка революционного пролетариата\" (\"Mayovka of the Revolutionary Proletariat\"). In the article two conditions for a revolutionary situation were described, which were later succinctly phrased as \"the bottoms don't want and the tops cannot live in the old way\". In later works Lenin postulated a third condition: high political activity of the working masses, their readiness to revolutionary actions. \n\nLenin describes the \"revolutionary situation\" as follows: \n\n\"To the Marxist it is indisputable that a revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation; \nfurthermore, it is not every revolutionary situation that leads to revolution. What, generally speaking, are the symptoms of a revolutionary situation? We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms: \n\n(1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the “upper classes”, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for “the lower classes not to want” to live in the old way; it is also \nnecessary that “the upper classes should be unable” to live in the old way; \n\n(2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual; \n\n(3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who \nuncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in “peace time”, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the “upper classes” themselves into independent \nhistorical action. \n\nWithout these objective changes, which are independent of the will, not only of individual groups and parties but even of individual classes, a revolution, as a general rule, is impossible.

{"id": "21148838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21148838", "title": "Scottish Gaelic phonology", "text": "Scottish Gaelic phonology\n\nThis article is about the phonology of the Scottish Gaelic language. There is no standard variety of Scottish Gaelic; although statements below are about all or most dialects, the north-western dialects (Outer Hebrides, Skye and the Northwest Highlands) are discussed more than others as they represent the majority of speakers.\n\nGaelic phonology is characterised by:\n\nDue to the geographic concentration of Gaelic speakers along the western seaboard with its numerous islands, Gaelic dialectologists tend to ascribe each island its own dialect. On the mainland, no clear dialect boundaries have been established to date but the main areas are generally assumed to be Argyllshire, Perthshire, Moidart/Ardnamurchan, Wester Ross and Sutherland.\n\nDescriptions of the language have largely focused on the phonology. Welsh naturalist Edward Lhuyd published the earliest major work on Scottish Gaelic after collecting data in the Scottish Highlands between 1699 and 1700, in particular data on Argyll Gaelic and the now obsolete dialects of north-east Inverness-shire.\n\nFollowing a significant gap, the middle to the end of the twentieth century saw a great flurry of dialect studies in particular by Scandinavian scholars, again focussing largely on phonology:\n\nIn the period between 1950 and 1963, fieldwork was carried out to document all then remaining Gaelic dialects, culminating in the publication of the five-volume \"Survey of the Gaelic Dialects of Scotland\" by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in 1997. The survey collected data from informants as far south as Arran, Cowal, Brig o' Turk, east to Blairgowrie, Braemar and Grantown-on-Spey, north-east to Dunbeath and Portskerra and all areas west of these areas, including St Kilda.\n\nThe following is a chart of the monophthong vowel phonemes appearing in Scottish Gaelic:\nAll vowel phonemes except for and can be both long (represented with ) and short. Note that phonologically, behaves both as a front or back vowel depending on the geographical area and vowel length.\n\nThe diphthongs of Scottish Gaelic are .\n\nVowels are written as follows:\n\nThe English equivalents given are approximate, and refer most closely to the Scottish pronunciation of Standard English. The vowel in English \"father\" is back in Southern English. The in English \"late\" in Scottish English is the pure vowel rather than the more general diphthong . The same is true for the in English \"boat\", in Scottish English, instead of the diphthong .\n\nThe language uses many vowel combinations, which can be categorised into two types, depending on the status of one or more of the written vowels in the combinations.\n\nCategory 1: vowel plus glide vowels. In this category, vowels in digraphs/trigraphs that are next to a neighbouring consonant are for all intents and purposes part of the consonant, showing the broad or slender status of the consonant.\nCategory 2: 'diphthongs' and 'triphthongs'. In this category, vowels are written together to represent either a diphthong, or what was in Middle Irish a diphthong.\n\nCategory 2 digraphs can by followed by Category 1 glides, and thereby form trigraphs:\n\nLike the closely related languages, Modern Irish and Manx, Scottish Gaelic contains what are traditionally referred to as \"broad\" and \"slender\" consonants. Historically, Primitive Irish consonants preceding the front vowels and developed a -like coarticulation similar to the palatalised consonants found in Russian while the consonants preceding the non-front vowels , and developed a velar coarticulation. While Irish distinguishes \"broad\" (i.e. phonetically velar or velarised consonants) and \"slender\" (i.e. phonetically palatal or palatalised consonants), in Scottish Gaelic velarisation is only present for . This means that consonants marked \"broad\" by the orthography are, for the most part simply unmarked, while \"slender\" consonants are palatal or palatalised. The main exception to this are the labials (), which have lost their palatalised forms. The only trace of their original palatalisation is a glide found before or after back vowels, e.g. \"beul\" ('mouth') vs \"beò\" ('alive').\nCeltic linguists traditionally transcribe slender consonants with an apostrophe (or more accurately, a prime) following the consonant (e.g. m′) and leave broad consonants unmarked.\n\nThe unaspirated stops in some dialects (east and south) are voiced (see below), as in Manx and Irish, while in all other areas full voicing is allophonic with regional variation, voicing occurs in certain environments, such as within breath groups and following homorganic nasals (see below). The variation suggests that the unaspirated stops at the underlying phonological level are voiced, with devoicing an allophonic variant that in some dialects has become the most common realisation. Irish dialects and Manx also have devoiced unaspirated consonants in certain environments.\n\nIn the modern languages, there is sometimes a stronger contrast from Old Gaelic in the assumed meaning of \"broad\" and \"slender\". In the modern languages, the phonetic difference between \"broad\" and \"slender\" consonants can be more complex than mere \"velarisation\"/\"palatalisation\". For instance, the Gaelic \"slender s\" is so palatalised that it has become postalveolar .\n\nCertain consonants (in particular the fricatives and the lenis coronals ) are rare in initial position except as a result of lenition.\n\nGaelic phonemes may have various allophones as well as dialectal or variations in pronunciation not shown in the chart above. The more common ones are:\n\nVelarised has 6 main realisations as shown on the map:\n\nThe Survey of Scottish Gaelic Dialects occasionally reports labialised forms such as or outside the area they predominantly appear in, for example in Harris and Wester Ross.\n\nThe fortis stops are voiceless and aspirated; this aspiration occurs as postaspiration in initial position and, in most dialects, as preaspiration in medial position after stressed vowels. Similar to the manifestation of aspiration, the slender consonants have a palatal offglide when initial and a palatal onglide when medial or final.\n\nPreaspiration varies in strength and can manifest as glottal ( or ) or can vary depending on the place of articulation of the preaspirated consonant; being before \"slender\" segments and before \"broad\" ones. The occurrence of preaspiration follows a hierarchy of c > t > p; i.e. if a dialect has preaspiration with , it will also have it in the other places of articulation. Preaspiration manifests itself as follows:\n\nLack of preaspiration coincides with full voicing of the unaspirated stops. Area 6 dialects in effect largely retain the Middle Irish stops, as has Manx and Irish.\n\nIn some Gaelic dialects (particularly the north-west), stops at the beginning of a stressed syllable become voiced when they follow nasal consonants of the definite article, for example: \"taigh\" ('a house') is but \"an taigh\" ('the house') is ; cf. also \"tombaca\" ('tobacco') . In such dialects, the lenis stops tend to be completely nasalised, thus \"doras\" ('a door') is , but \"an doras\" ('the door') is . This is similar to eclipsis in Classical Gaelic and Irish, but not identical as it only occurs when a nasal is phonetically present whereas eclipsis in Classical Gaelic and Irish may occur in positions following a historic (but no longer present) nasal.\n\nThe voicing of voiceless aspirated stops and the nasalisation of the unaspirated (voiced) stops occurs after the preposition an/am ('in'), an/am ('their'), the interrogative particle an and a few other such particles and occasionally, after any word ending in a nasal e.g. \"a bheil thu a' faighinn cus?\" as rather than .\n\nIn southern Hebridean dialects, the nasal optionally drops out entirely before a consonant, including plosives.\n\nThe lenited consonants have special pronunciations.\n\nThe is not lenited when it appears before . Lenition may be blocked when homorganic consonants (i.e. those made at the same place of articulation) clash with grammatical lenition rules. Some of these rules are active (particularly with dentals), others have become fossilised (i.e. velars and labials). For example, blocked lenition in the surname \"Caimbeul\" ('Campbell') (vs \"Camshron\" 'Cameron') is an incident of fossilised blocked lenition; blocked lenition in \"air an taigh salach\" \"on the dirty house\" (vs \"air a' bhalach mhath\" 'on the good boy') is an example of the productive lenition blocking rule.\n\nStress is usually on the first syllable: for example \"drochaid\" ('a bridge') .\n\nA distinctive characteristic of Gaelic pronunciation (also present in Scots and Scottish English dialects (cf. \"girl\" and \"film\" ) is the insertion of epenthetic vowels between certain adjacent consonants. This affects orthographic l n r when followed by orthographic b bh ch g gh m mh; and orthographic m followed by l r s ch.\n\nOccasionally, there are irregular occurrences of the epenthetic vowel, for example in \"Glaschu\" ('Glasgow').\n\nThere are often wide variations in vowel quality in epenthetic vowels, as illustrated by a map showing the pronunciations of \"dearbh.\"\n\nSchwa at the end of a word is dropped when followed by a word beginning with a vowel. For example:\n\nOf all the Celtic languages, lexical tones only exist in the dialects of Lewis and Sutherland in the extreme north of the Gaelic-speaking area. Phonetically and historically, these resemble the tones of Norway, Sweden and western Denmark; these languages have tonal contours typical for monosyllabic words and those for disyllabic words. In Lewis Gaelic, it is difficult to find minimal pairs. Among the rare examples are: \"bodh(a)\" ('underwater rock') vs. \"bò\" ('cow'), and \"fitheach\" ('raven') vs. \"fiach\" ('debt'). Another example is the tonal difference between \"ainm\" and \"anam\" , the latter of which has the tonal contour appropriate to a disyllable. These tonal differences are not to be found in Ireland or elsewhere in the Scottish \"Gàidhealtachd\". Furthermore, they are disappearing entirely among younger speakers even in Lewis.\n\nThe regular verbal noun particle, written <(e)adh>, has several pronunciations.\n\nFor some words it is possible to resolve the indeterminate area, for example with the verb sgrìobadh (\"scraping\"):\n\n"}

{"id": "198716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198716", "title": "Virtual water", "text": "Virtual water\n\nVirtual water trade (also known as trade in embedded or embodied water) refers to the hidden flow of water if food or other commodities are traded from one place to another. For instance, it takes 1,340 cubic meters of water (based on the world average) to produce one metric tonne of wheat. The precise volume can be more or less depending on climatic conditions and agricultural practice. Hoekstra and Chapagain have defined the virtual-water content of a product (a commodity, good or service) as \"the volume of freshwater used to produce the product, measured at the place where the product was actually produced\". It refers to the sum of the water use in the various steps of the production chain.\n\nKing's College London and the SOAS, University of London introduced the virtual water concept, to support his argument that countries in the Middle East can save their scarce water resources by relying more on import of food. For his contributions he was awarded the 2008 Stockholm Water Prize. Allan stated: \"The water is said to be virtual because once the wheat is grown, the real water used to grow it is no longer actually contained in the wheat. The concept of virtual water helps us realize how much water is needed to produce different goods and services. In semi-arid and arid areas, knowing the virtual water value of a good or service can be useful towards determining how best to use the scarce water available.\"\n\nThere are, however, significant deficiencies with the concept of virtual water that mean there is a significant risk in relying on these measures to guide policy conclusions. Accordingly, Australia's National Water Commission considers that the measurement of virtual water has little practical value in decision making regarding the best allocation of scarce water resources.\n\nVirtual water trade refers to the idea that when goods and services are exchanged, so is virtual water. When a country imports one tonne of wheat instead of producing it domestically, it is saving about 1,300 cubic meters of real indigenous water. If this country is water-scarce, the water that is 'saved' can be used towards other ends. If the exporting country is water-scarce, however, it has exported 1,300 cubic meters of virtual water since the real water used to grow the wheat will no longer be available for other purposes. This has obvious strategic implications for countries that are water-constrained such as those found in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) area.\n\nWater-scarce countries like Palestine discourage the export of oranges (relatively water intensive crops) precisely to prevent large quantities of water being exported to different parts of the world.\n\nIn recent years, the concept of virtual water trade has gained weight both in the scientific as well as in the political debate. The notion of the concept is ambiguous. It changes between an analytical, descriptive concept and a political induced strategy. As an analytical concept, virtual water trade represents an instrument which allows the identification and assessment of policy options not only in the scientific but also in the political discourse. As a politically induced strategy the question is, whether virtual water trade can be implemented in a sustainable way, whether the implementation can be managed in a social, economical and ecological fashion, and for which countries the concept offers a meaningful option.\n\nThe data that underlie the concept of virtual water can readily be used to construct water satellite accounts, and brought into economic models of international trade such as the GTAP Computable General Equilibrium Model. Such a model can be used to study the economic implications of changes in water supply or water policy, as well as the water resource implications of economic development and trade liberalisation.\n\nIn sum, virtual water trade allows a new, amplified perspective on water problems: In the framework of recent developments from a supply-oriented to a demand-oriented management of water resources it opens up new fields of governance and facilitates a differentiation and balancing of different perspectives, basic conditions and interests. Analytically, the concept enables one to distinguish between global, regional and local levels and their linkages. This means, that water resource problems have to be solved in \"problemsheds\" if they cannot be successfully addressed in the local or regional watershed. Virtual water trade can thus overcome the hydro-centricity of a narrow watershed view. According to the proceedings of a 2006 conference in Frankfurt, Germany, it seems reasonable to link the new concept with the approach of integrated water resources management.\n\nKey shortcomings of virtual water measures are that the concept:\n\n\nThe deficiencies with the concept of virtual water mean that there is a significant risk in relying on these measures to guide policy conclusions. Accordingly, Australia's National Water Commission considers that the measurement of virtual water has little practical value in decision making regarding the best allocation of scarce water resources.\n\nOther limitations more specific to the MENA (Middle East & North Africa) region include:\n\nThe concept of virtual water trade was introduced to refer to the idea that countries can save domestic water by importing food. Imported food, however, comes from somewhere. In 2002, professor Arjen Y. Hoekstra, at the time working for UNESCO-IHE, now at University of Twente, the Netherlands, introduced the concept of water footprint. The water footprint shows the link between consumer goods or a consumption pattern and water use and pollution. Virtual water trade and water footprint can be seen as part of a bigger story: the globalization of water.\n\nSome researchers have attempted to use the methods of energy analysis, which aim to produce embodied energy estimates, to derive virtual, or embodied water estimates.\n\nThe following table shows the average virtual water content of some selected products for a number of selected countries (m/ton):\n\n\n"}
