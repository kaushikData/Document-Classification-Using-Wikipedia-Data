By using a stemmatic approach, the textual critic tries to trace the oldest surviving manuscript and show the relationship it has to its ancestors. This makes it possible to compare changes made in different traditions branching off from the archetype, and develop an edition that reconstructs the text of the archetype as closely as possible.\n\nAn archetype should not be confused with the autograph, which is the first handwritten manuscript by an author. The archetype is also commonly mistaken to be the original text, although many would argue that it is impossible to locate an original text within a tradition where there may not be surviving evidence, and because the author and editors may have constructed several drafts and editions throughout the process, from the moment of birth of the author's idea until the publication of an edition of the work. On the other hand, an archetype could be the original, in the sense that it is not a copy, but the concrete surviving, unmodified text.\n\n\nBordalejo, Barbara: \"The genealogy of texts: Manuscript traditions and textual traditions.\" \"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities\" (2016) 31 (3): 563–577. .\n"}

This phrase is often used in casual conversation in Hebrew pop culture.\n\n\"Ask the Rabbi\" is often used as an internet term for \"responsa\": questions sent to rabbis and the answers received. The term became widespread on Jewish websites in the early 2000s.\n\nJewish religious literature contains thousands of books of responsa also known as \"Shut\" in Hebrew, which started during the time of the Geonim and are popular to this day. The questions range over many topics, mostly about Jewish law (Halacha), but also requests for an explanation of a Talmudic issue or Jewish thought. The answers may be short or long and very detailed. A large part from the correspondence is from rabbis, or from community leaders, sending an important question to a great rabbi. Naturally, the questions asked in the past did not demand an immediate and urgent answer.\n\nAt the present time, due to the internet, communication is fast and knowledge can be made public, there are several websites that feature rabbis answering questions received through the web site, by Email or by SMS. The questions are answered within a few days or, for urgent questions, within a few hours. The majority of online questions come from the general public, Jewish and non-Jewish, and cover many topics. Many questioners use the anonymity of the Internet for intimate questions they are embarrassed to ask face to face. This way of answering is so popular, that some articles are based on them.\n\nThe option to ask questions about Judaism online was received enthusiastically by web users. However, there is some opposition to this phenomenon. The main criticism is around the replacement of old fashioned, face-to-face communication by a virtual medium and the \"instant\" answers received to the questions. Judaism teaches the importance of study and work in order to gain knowledge, and the ease of asking the Internet might promote laziness and degradation of the value of knowledge.\nAdditional questions arise, such as whether to answer the specific questioner or to think about other users who will see the answer, whether to answer locally or in an extended way, and whether to answer certain questions.\n\n"}

Malaysian English should not be confused with Malaysian Colloquial English, which is famously known as Manglish, a portmanteau of the word Malay and English, or Street English.\n\nManglish can be likened to an English-based pidgin language or a patois and it is usually barely understandable to most speakers of English outside Malaysia except in the case of Singapore where a similar colloquial form of English is spoken known as Singlish. Though very similar, Manglish today receives more Malay influences while Singlish more Chinese.\n\nDespite being traditionally-based on British English, Malaysian English has, in recent decades, been strongly influenced by American English. This can be commonly seen in web-based media and documents produced within organisations. When using computers, the writer is typically unaware of the differences between British and American English and uses the default settings on their software spell-checker. Most computer software in Malaysia, including Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office, come pre-set with American English as the default and these settings are seldom changed to British English, resulting in the proliferation of American English in many places of work, local universities and other places with heavy reliance on documents and content created by using computers. In schools and in the print media however, Malaysians revert to British English.\n\nManglish does not possess a standard written form, although many variations exist for transcribing certain words. For most purposes it is a spoken tongue.\n\nIn Malaysian education, written English is based on British English but most of the students speak in a local accent influenced by American pronunciations.\n\nMuch of Manglish grammatical structure is taken from varieties of Chinese and the Malay language. For example, the phrase \"Why you so like that one?\" means \"Why are you behaving in that way\" in standard English. In Cantonese, a similar phrase would be rendered as \"Dímgáai néih gám ge?\" or literally \"Why you like that?\" The \"one\" in the sample phrase does not literally mean the numeral one, instead it is used more as a suffix device. It is also sometimes rendered as \"wan.\" The use of Manglish is discouraged at schools, where only Malaysian English is taught.\n\nOther common characteristics are anastrophe and omission of certain prepositions and articles. For example, \"I haven't seen you in a long time\" becomes \"Long time never seen you already\".\n\nTo a large extent, standard Malaysian English is descended from British English, largely due to the country's colonisation by Britain beginning from the 18th century. But because of influence from American mass media, particularly in the form of television programmes and movies, Malaysians are also usually familiar with many American English words. For instance, both lift/elevator and lorry/truck are understood, although the British form is preferred. Only in some very limited cases is the American English form more widespread, e.g. chips instead of crisps, fries instead of chips.\n\nMalaysian English is gradually forming its own vocabulary, these words come from a variety of influences. Typically, for words or phrases that are based on other English words, the Malaysian English speaker may be unaware that the word or phrase is not present in British or American English.\n\nThis is a list of words and phrases that have one meaning in British English and another in Malaysian English\n\nIn Malaysian English, the last syllable of a word is sometimes not pronounced with the strength that it would be in British English.\n\nAlso, p and f are sometimes pronounced somewhat similarly among speakers of Malay descent. For example, the two Malay names 'Fazlin' and 'Pazlin' may sound almost identical when spoken by Malays, whereas this confusion would not arise when spoken by a British Speaker.\n\n\n"}

The business was acquired by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) in 1992.\n\nIn addition to consulting services, the Company had two products: MATCH and DETECT.\n\nThe Match product provided automated systems for telephone companies in Operations, administration and management (OA&M) to migrate telephone services delivered by existings analogue AT&T 1AESS switches to newer digital switches, such as Northern Telecom's DMS-100 or AT&T's 5ESS switches. The MATCH was composed of three main system components: Decoding, Matching, and Provisioning. The Decoding module would decode core memory dumps from the AT&T 1AESS, 5AESS, Nortel DMS-100, and operating databases including COSMOS and TIRKS. Network inventory, services, and related constructs would be stored in a proprietary MATCH universal database management system, which was configurable based on job and customer preferences.

He presents four arguments for biological innateness of psychological capacities, parallel to arguments in biology for the innateness of physical traits:\n\n\nIn his publication \"Biological Foundations of Language\" he advanced the hypothesis of a critical period for language development; a topic which remains controversial and the subject of debate.

{"id": "803586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=803586", "title": "Gender reform in Esperanto", "text": "Gender reform in Esperanto\n\nGender asymmetry is one of the aspects of the constructed language Esperanto that is most frequently targeted for criticism. There are numerous proposals to regularize both grammatical and lexical gender. Although the language is unable to change. \n\nIn the text below, when a proposed word or usage is not grammatically correct according to the standard rules of Esperanto grammar, it will be marked with an asterisk.\n\nEsperanto does not have grammatical gender other than in the two personal pronouns \"li\" \"he\" and \"ŝi\" \"she\". Nevertheless, gender is often a fuzzy issue. In practical usage words formed with the suffix \"-ul\" \"person\" are ambiguous, sometimes used with a masculine meaning in the singular, but generally neutral in the plural. However, concepts of gender have changed over time, and many words that were once considered masculine are now neutral, especially words related to professions and animals. In older texts it is only context that disambiguates. For example, in the saying \"al feliĉulo eĉ koko donas ovojn\" \"to a happy man, even a \"koko\" gives eggs\" (Zamenhof), the word \"koko\" means \"rooster\", not \"chicken\". However, this can be confusing to those who are not familiar with that saying, as the word \"koko\" has become more neutral over time.\n\nIn modern usage, most noun roots are lexically neutral, a couple of dozen are lexically masculine, and a smaller number lexically feminine. Most masculine roots may be made feminine through the addition of the suffix \"-ino,\" and made to describe a group of both males and females with the addition of \"ge-.\" For example, \"patro\" means \"father\", \"patrino\" \"mother\", and \"gepatroj\" \"parents\", but \"gepatroj\" cannot be used in the singular \"*gepatro\" for \"parent\". For these gendered words there is no easy way to make the singular neutral equivalent. Often there is a separate root that acts like this, for example \"knabo\" \"boy\" → \"infano\" \"child\"; \"filo\" \"son\" → \"ido\" \"offspring\", etc. Some neutral counterparts can be made with word-building. The meaning of \"parent\" can be achieved with either \"gener-into\" \"genitor\", or \"ge-patr-ano\" \"member of the parents\". However, it is more common to simply say \"unu el la gepatroj\" \"one of the parents\" or \"patro aŭ patrino\" \"father or mother\".\n\nThe most common roots that are masculine unless specifically marked as feminine are:\n\nGender-neutral roots such as \"leono\" \"lion\" and \"kelnero\" \"waiter\" may be made feminine with a grammatical suffix \"(leonino\" \"lioness\", \"kelnerino\" \"waitress\"), but there is no comparable way to derive the masculine; there was not even originally a word for \"male\". Words without a feminine suffix may take a masculine reading, especially in the case of people and domestic animals; \"koko,\" for example, means \"chicken\", but is read as masculine in \"koko kaj kokino\" \"rooster and hen\". Zamenhof used the nominal root \"vir\" \"man, human male\" to make words for animals masculine. Originally this took the form of a suffix \"-viro,\" but in response to criticisms that the resulting words such as \"bovoviro\" \"bull\" were ambiguous with mythological man–animal hybrids such as minotaurs (also \"bovoviro\"), Zamenhof switched to using \"vir\" as a prefix in his translation of \"Genesis\" in the 1920s. This usage has spread, and \"vir-\" is now widely used as a prefix in the case of animals (\"virleono\" \"male-lion\", \"virhomo\" \"male-human\"), but as a separate adjective \"vira\" for professions (\"vira kelnero\" \"male waiter\"), with \"-viro\" now considered archaic, though neither of these conventions is as common as feminine \"-ino.\" Moreover, the prefix \"vir-\" is idiomatic, as \"virbovo\" (man-bovine) could still mean either \"bull\" or \"minotaur/cherub\"; it is only by convention that it is generally understood to mean \"bull\", and writers have coined words such as \"taŭro\" \"bull\" to bypass the issue.\n\nCritics such as Dale Spender and Veronica Zundel feel that deriving feminine from masculine words causes women to be either \"linguistically excluded… or else named negatively\", while others are bothered by the lack of symmetry. Such sentiments have sparked numerous attempts at reform, none of which have been accepted by the Akademio de Esperanto.\n\nReforms tend to address a few key areas:\n\nThree specific proposals surface repeatedly, as they derive from the existing resources of the language. These are the masculine suffix \"*-iĉo,\" workarounds and expanded uses of the epicene prefix \"ge-,\" and the epicene pronoun \"*ŝli.\"\n\nPerhaps the earliest proposal for a masculine grammatical suffix was \"*-uno.\" \"*-Olo\" is also occasionally seen. However, the most popular today is \"*-iĉo.\"\n\n\"*-Uno\" was created through ablaut of \"-ino.\" It is, in fact, the only such possibility, as \"-ano, -eno,\" and \"-ono\" already exist. Similarly, \"*-olo\" was created through ablaut of \"-ulo\" \"person\". \"*-Iĉo\" was created by analogy with the pet-name suffix \"-ĉjo,\" the only masculine suffix in the language, so that the pet names and general gender suffixes are symmetrical:\n\nAn element common to all such proposals is that the gender-changing nouns are to be reanalyzed as gender neutral when they occur without a gender suffix, as the names of professions and nationalities, such as \"policano\" \"policeman\" → \"police officer\" and \"anglo\" \"Englishman\" → \"English person\", did in the mid twentieth century. This doesn't affect all words: Nouns that never changed gender to begin with, such as \"taŭro\" \"bull\", do not take gender suffixes in these reforms either. The resulting paradigms are as follows:\n\nThe most common objection to the \"*-iĉo\" proposal is the very analysis of words such as \"patro\" as gender neutral. The reason behind the objection is that the specifically masculine words are defined as such in the Fundamento, and it is felt that reanalyzing them as gender neutral violates the Fundamento. One proposed solution to this problem is to introduce new root words for the gender neutral concepts: parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, etc. As an example, the hypothetical root word *tevo (parent) could then accept both \"*-iĉo\" to denote \"father\" and \"-ino\" to denote \"mother\".\n\nThough none of these are widespread, \"*-iĉo\" has appeared in books published by Jorge Camacho and Luiz Portella.\n\nProponents of one proposal often claim that a competing proposal is confusing because it resembles an existing suffix, for example that \"*patriĉo\" \"father\" resembles pejorative \"patraĉo\" \"a bad father\", or that \"*patruno\" \"father\" resembles \"patrino\" \"mother\", but there does not seem to be a problem in actual use: With the word stress on the suffix vowel, \"-iĉo/-aĉo\" and \"-uno/-ino\" are as distinct as many other pairs of Esperanto suffixes, such as \"-ilo/-ulo.\" One specific objection to the \"-iĉo\" proposal is that \"*nepiĉo\" \"grandson\" is homophonous with \"ne piĉo\", \"piĉo\" being Esperanto slang for \"pussy\"; on the other hand, \"uno\" would mean not just \"a male\" but also \"the UN\".\n\nVarious epicene affixes have also been proposed. They may be proposed \"instead of\" a masculine suffix—that is, gender derivation remains as in standard Esperanto, but the language gains a simple way of saying \"a parent\"—or \"in addition to\" a masculine suffix, often to avoid confusion between people speaking reformed and standard Esperanto. The only such affix commonly seen is the prefix \"ge-\". In standard Esperanto, \"ge-\" means both sexes together, and is normally only seen in the plural. In conversation, however, singular \"ge-\" is not uncommonly extended to meanings such as \"*gepatro\" \"a parent\" when a speaker either doesn't know or doesn't wish to reveal the gender of the noun. Many gender-reform proposals would make such usage official.\n\nPeople who use \"*patriĉo\" for \"father\" may avoid the unaffixed noun \"patro\" \"*parent\" altogether as ambiguous, or may use it and switch to \"*gepatro\" only when they need to disambiguate.\n\nMany of these proposals propose that all gender-changing words such as \"patro\" become neutral once a masculine suffix is in use, with the only remaining gendered words being those such as \"taŭro\" and \"damo\" that never changed gender to begin with. However, since \"viro\" has numerous masculine uses, and there are already dedicated words for the neutral and feminine equivalents (\"adolto\" \"adult\" or \"plenkreskulo\" \"grownup\", and \"femino\" \"woman\"), \"viro\" is also commonly retained as a masculine root.\n\nThe word \"eŭnuko\" \"eunuch\" has through back-formation given rise to the suffix \"*-uko\" for castrated people or animals, creating forms such as \"*bovuko\" \"steer\", from \"bovo\" \"cattle\", to replace \"okso\" \"steer\", though \"eks-\" \"ex-\" is sometimes seen in this context: \"eksvirkato\" \"castrated cat\" (lit. \"ex-male-cat\") vs. \"*katuko\".\n\nAs in English, Esperanto has a personal pronoun for \"he\", \"li,\" and \"she\", \"ŝi\". Paraphrasing \"li aŭ ŝi\" \"he or she\" to avoid mentioning gender is, as in English, considered awkward, and is avoided in conversation and literature. There are two general approaches to resolving this issue: modifying an existing pronoun, and creating a new pronoun.\n\nThe existing third-person pronouns are \"li\" \"he\" (the pronoun generally used when gender is not known), \"ŝi\" \"she\", \"ĝi\" \"it\", \"ili\" \"they\", \"oni\" \"one\", \"si\" (reflexive), \"tiu\" \"that one\".\n\n\"Ĝi\" is used principally with animals and objects. Zamenhof also prescribed it to be the epicene pronoun for use when the sex of an individual is unknown. However, in his writing it is only used for children:\nThe idea that \"ĝi\" cannot be used for people in general is due to interference from English - other languages use neuter pronouns for people (e.g. o in Turkish, hän in Finnish). Uralic and Turkic languages do not have gender and use the same gender neutral pronoun for \"he\", \"she\", \"it\" of English. In Zamenhof's day it was customary to specify gender whenever it was known . A shift from \"li\" and \"ŝi\" to \"ĝi\" would thus be a stylistic extension similar to the ongoing shift from copula-plus-adjective to verb (such as \"bluas\" for \"estas blua),\" and nothing so radical as the creation of a new pronoun would be required.\n\nHowever, when gender becomes a problem it is much more common for people to use the demonstrative adjective and pronoun \"tiu\" (that one) as a work-around. Unfortunately, this remedy is not always available. For example, in the sentence,\nthe pronoun \"li\" cannot easily be replaced with \"tiu,\" as that would normally be understood to refer to someone other than the person speaking:\nSimilar problems of confusion arise with trying to use \"oni\" \"one\" in such situations:\nThis could be used to express deference or other forms of indirectness, but would not be understood to refer to the person who made the statement.\n\nIt would be possible to extend the use of reflexive pronoun \"si,\" which officially cannot occur in subject position, to that of a logophoric pronoun:\nAlthough not a full solution, as \"si\" refers to a previously mentioned person, this could be used in combination with \"tiu\" to introduce a subject. It also has the advantage of clarifying the sentence, since it is ambiguous in standard Esperanto whether \"li\" \"he\" refers to the someone who is speaking, or someone else. However, logophoric pronouns are alien to European languages, and this solution is rare.\n\nDue to English influence, singular \"they\" has been reported:\n\nHowever this causes problems regarding Esperanto’s noun agreements and is not readily accepted by people of other language backgrounds.\n\nA proposal which is totally consistent with regular grammar is to hyphenate \"li\" (\"he\") and \"ŝi\" (\"she\") to \"li-ŝi\" (or \"ŝi-li\"), similar to some other constructs in Esperanto, such as \"pli-malpli\" (\"more or less\").\n\nFinally, the epicene sense of \"li\" can be made explicit with singular \"ge-,\" though pronouns do not normally take any affixes apart from grammatical inflections:\n\nExisting Esperanto personal pronouns end in \"i\", and only four proposals for a new pronoun are at all common: \"gi\", \"hi\", \"ri\", and the blend \"ŝli.\"\n\n\"Gi\" is a popular proposal because it is iconic: in writing, it resembles \"ĝi,\" which it also resembles in meaning, and it is similar to the occasionally epicene prefix \"ge-.\" This makes it readily recognizable. Also along these lines is the use of the epicene prefix itself, \"geli.\"\n\nMaking \"li\" the epicene pronoun is also a common approach, as it is transparently related to the epicene plural \"ili\" \"they\". Such approaches then diverge in how to treat the masculine. Gender may simply be abandoned, reducing the inventory to \"li\" \"s/he\" and \"ili\" \"they\", or a new masculine pronoun may be created. One proposal is \"hi\" \"he\", so that the gendered pronouns \"hi\" and \"ŝi\" both derive from English.\n\nA variant of this that was popular for a time in online newsgroups, called \",\" modifies \"li\" slightly to \"ri\" as a signal that the speaker is using gender-neutral pronouns, but then in order to avoid confusion eliminates \"li\" and \"ŝi\" completely, so that the inventory becomes \"ri\" \"s/he\" and \"ili\" \"they\". The riist \"manifesto\" also adopts the masculine suffix \"*-iĉo\" and the occasional epicene use of \"ge-\" to avoid any resulting confusion. Critics maintain that it is important to retain the option of gendered pronouns, if for no other reason than the translation of much of the world's literature; and that in actual rather than theoretical use, \"*ri\" as a pronoun would cause chronic confusion with the many verbs that begin with \"ri-,\" such as \"ri gardas\" \"s/he keeps\" vs \"rigardas\" \"looks\", \"ri petas\" \"s/he asks\" vs \"ripetas\" \"repeats\", \"etc.\"\n\nBreaking with the single consonant-\"i\" form of the pronouns, but instantly recognizable to most Esperantists, is another proposal, \"ŝli.\" This is just the reading pronunciation of the abbreviation \"ŝ/li,\" the equivalent of English \"s/he\", and is frequently seen in informal writing.\n\nIn addition to removing gender from the singular pronouns, proposals have also been made to add gender to the plural in order to better translate material (such as the Bible) that was written in a language that has plural gender.\n\nDue to the symmetry between \"li\" \"he\" and \"ili\" \"they\", the obvious choice is to make \"ili\" masculine and to create an analogous feminine form, *\"iŝi.\" This was proposed by Kálmán Kalocsay and Gaston Waringhien in the 3rd edition of their \"Plena Gramatiko de Esperanto\" (pp 72–73, note 1). They cited the biblical passage Matthew 28:10-11:\n\nIt is obvious from context that \"They will see me there\" refers to the brothers. However, the identity of the \"they\" in \"While they were going\" is completely opaque. Kalocsay and Waringhien proposed the following solution:\n\n"}

{"id": "174892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174892", "title": "Ishi", "text": "Ishi\n\nIshi (c. 1861 – March 25, 1916) was the last known member of the Native American Yahi people from the present-day state of California in the United States. The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the Yana) were killed in the California genocide in the 19th century. Ishi, who was widely acclaimed as the \"last wild Indian\" in America, lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture. In 1911, aged 50, he emerged near the foothills of Lassen Peak in Northern California.\n\n\"Ishi\", which means \"man\" in the Yana language, is an adopted name. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi. When asked his name, he said: \"I have none, because there were no people to name me,\" meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name on his behalf.\n\nIshi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley, who both studied him and hired him as a research assistant. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1865, Ishi and his family were attacked in the Three Knolls Massacre, in which 40 of their tribesmen were killed. Although 33 Yahi survived to escape, cattlemen killed about half of the survivors. The last survivors, including Ishi and his family, went into hiding for the next 44 years. Their tribe was popularly believed to be extinct. Prior to the California Gold Rush of 1848–1855, the Yahi population numbered 404 in California, but the total Yana in the larger region numbered 2,997.\n\nThe gold rush brought tens of thousands of miners and settlers to northern California, putting pressure on native populations. Gold mining damaged water supplies and killed fish; the deer left the area. The settlers brought new infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. The northern Yana group became extinct while the central and southern groups (who later became part of Redding Rancheria) and Yahi populations dropped dramatically. Searching for food, they came into conflict with settlers, leading to the latter setting bounties on the natives. Prices included 50 cents per scalp and 5 dollars per head. In 1865, the settlers attacked the Yahi while they were still asleep.\n\nRichard Burrill wrote, in \"Ishi Rediscovered\": \n\"In 1865, near the Yahi’s special place, Black Rock, the waters of Mill Creek turned red at the Three Knolls Massacre. 'Sixteen' or 'seventeen' Indian fighters killed about forty Yahi, as part of a retaliatory attack for two white women and a man killed at the Workman’s household on Lower Concow Creek near Oroville. Eleven of the Indian fighters that day were Robert A. Anderson, Hiram Good, Sim Moak, Hardy Thomasson, Jack Houser, Henry Curtis, his brother Frank Curtis, as well as Tom Gore, Bill Matthews, and William Merithew. W. J. Seagraves visited the site, too, but some time after the battle had been fought.\n\nRobert Anderson wrote, \"Into the stream they leaped, but few got out alive. Instead many dead bodies floated down the rapid current.\" One captive Indian woman named Mariah from Big Meadows (Lake Almanor today), was one of those who did escape. The Three Knolls battle is also described in Theodora Kroeber’s \"Ishi in Two Worlds.\"\n\nSince then more has been learned. It is estimated that with this massacre, Ishi's entire cultural group, the Yana/Yahi, may have been reduced to about sixty individuals. From 1859 to 1911, Ishi's remote band became more and more infiltrated by non-Yahi Indian representatives, such as Wintun, Nomlaki, and Pit River individuals.\n\nIn 1879, the federal government started Indian boarding schools in California. Some men from the reservations became renegades in the hills. Volunteers among the settlers and military troops carried out additional campaigns against the northern California Indian tribes during that period.\n\nIn late 1908, a group of surveyors came across the camp inhabited by two men, a middle-aged woman, and an elderly woman. These were Ishi, his uncle, his younger sister, and his mother, respectively. The former three fled while the latter hid herself in blankets to avoid detection, as she was sick and unable to flee. The surveyors ransacked the camp and Ishi's mother died soon after his return. His sister and uncle never returned.\n\nAfter the 1908 attack, Ishi spent three more years in the wilderness, alone. Finally, starving and with nowhere to go, at around the age of 50, on August 29, 1911, Ishi walked out into the western world. He was captured attempting to forage for meat near Oroville, California, after forest fires in the area.\n\nThe local sheriff took the man into custody for his protection. The \"wild man\" caught the imagination and attention of thousands of onlookers and curiosity seekers. Professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Museum of Anthropology—now the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)—read about him and brought him to their facility, then housed on the University of California, San Francisco campus in an old law school building. Studied by the university, Ishi also worked with them as a research assistant and lived in an apartment at the museum for most of the remaining five years of his life. In June 1915, he temporarily lived in Berkeley with the anthropologist Thomas Talbot Waterman and his family.\nWaterman and Alfred L. Kroeber, director of the museum, studied Ishi closely over the years and interviewed him at length in an effort to reconstruct Yahi culture. He described family units, naming patterns, and the ceremonies that he knew. Much tradition had already been lost when he was growing up, as there were few older survivors in his group. He identified material items and showed the techniques by which they were made. Ishi provided valuable information on his native Yana language, which was recorded and studied by the linguist Edward Sapir, who had previously done work on the northern dialects.\n\nLacking acquired immunity to the diseases common among European Americans, Ishi was often ill. He was treated by Saxton T. Pope, a professor of medicine at UCSF. Pope became close friends with Ishi, and learned from him how to make bows and arrows in the Yahi way. He and Ishi often hunted together.\n\nIshi died of tuberculosis on March 25, 1916. It is said his last words were \"You stay. I go.\" His friends at the university initially had tried to prevent an autopsy on Ishi's body, since Yahi tradition called for the body to remain intact. But the doctors at the University of California medical school performed an autopsy before Waterman could prevent it. \n\nIshi's brain was preserved and the body cremated. His friends placed grave goods with his remains before cremation: \"one of his bows, five arrows, a basket of acorn meal, a boxful of shell bead money, a purse full of tobacco, three rings, and some obsidian flakes.\" Ishi's remains were interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Colma, near San Francisco. \n\nKroeber put Ishi's preserved brain in a deerskin-wrapped Pueblo Indian pottery jar and sent it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1917. It was held there until August 10, 2000, when the Smithsonian repatriated it to the descendants of the Redding Rancheria and Pit River tribes. This was in accordance with the National Museum of the American Indian Act of 1989 (NMAI). According to Robert Fri, director of the National Museum of Natural History, \"Contrary to commonly-held belief, Ishi was not the last of his kind. In carrying out the repatriation process, we learned that as a Yahi–Yana Indian his closest living descendants are the Yana people of northern California.\" His remains were also returned from Colma, and the tribal members intended to bury them in a secret place.\n\nIn 1994, Steven Shackley of UC Berkeley learned of a paper by Jerald Johnson, who noted morphological evidence that Ishi's facial features and height were more typical of the Wintu and Maidu. He theorized that under pressure of diminishing populations, members of groups that were once enemies may have intermarried to survive. Johnson also referred to oral histories of the Wintu and Maidu that told of the tribes' intermarrying with the Yahi. The debate on this has not been definitively settled. \n\nIn 1996, Shackley announced work based on a study of Ishi's projectile points and those of the northern tribes. He had found that points made by Ishi were not typical of those recovered from historical Yahi sites. Because Ishi's production was more typical of points of the Nomlaki or Wintu tribes, and markedly dissimilar to those of Yahi, Shackley suggested that Ishi may have been of mixed ancestry, and related to and raised among members of another of the tribes. He based his conclusion on a study of the points made by Ishi compared to others held by the museum from the Yahi, Nomlaki and Wintu cultures. \n\nAmong Ishi's techniques was the use of what is known as an Ishi stick, used to run long pressure flakes. This is known to be a traditional technique of the Nomlaki and Wintu tribes. This suggests that Ishi may have learned the skill directly from a male relative of one of those tribes. These people lived in small bands, close to the Yahi. They were traditional competitors and enemies of the Yahi.\nIshi's story has been compared to that of Ota Benga, an Mbuti pygmy from Congo. His family had died and were not given a mourning ritual. He was taken from his home and culture. During one period, he was displayed as a zoo exhibit. Ota died on March 20, 1916, five days before Ishi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It includes Arabic Calligraphy, Ottoman, and Persian calligraphy. It is known in Arabic as \"khatt Islami\" (خط اسلامي), meaning Islamic line, design, or construction.\n\nThe development of Islamic calligraphy is strongly tied to the Qur'an; chapters and excerpts from the Qur'an are a common and almost universal text upon which Islamic calligraphy is based. Deep religious association with the Qur'an, as well as suspicion of figurative art as idolatrous, has led calligraphy to become one of the major forms of artistic expression in Islamic cultures. It has also been argued that Islamic calligraphy was motivated less by iconophobia (since, in fact, images were by no means absent in Islamic art) than by the centrality of the notion of writing and written text in Islam. It is noteworthy, for instance, that the Prophet Muhammad is related to have said: \"The first thing God created was the pen.\"\n\nAs Islamic calligraphy is highly venerated, most works follow examples set by well-established calligraphers, with the exception of secular or contemporary works. In antiquity, a pupil would copy a master's work repeatedly until their handwriting was similar. The most common style is divided into angular and cursive, each further divided into several sub-styles.\n\nThe traditional instrument of the Islamic calligrapher is the kalam, a pen normally made of dried reed or bamboo; the ink is often in color, and chosen such that its intensity can vary greatly so that the greater strokes of the compositions can be very dynamic in their effect. Some styles are often written using a metallic-tip pen.\n\nIslamic calligraphy is applied to a wide range of decorative mediums other than paper, such as tiles, vessels, carpets, and inscriptions. Before the advent of paper, papyrus and parchment were used for writing. The advent of paper revolutionized calligraphy. While monasteries in Europe treasured a few dozen volumes, libraries in the Muslim world regularly contained hundreds and even thousands of books.\n\nCoins were another support for calligraphy. Beginning in 692, the Islamic caliphate reformed the coinage of the Near East by replacing visual depiction with words. This was especially true for dinars, or gold coins of high value. Generally, the coins were inscribed with quotes from the Qur'an.\n\nBy the tenth century, the Persians, who had converted to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks. So precious were calligraphic inscribed textiles that Crusaders brought them to Europe as prized possessions. A notable example is the Suaire de Saint-Josse, used to wrap the bones of St. Josse in the Abbey of St. Josse-sur-Mer, near Caen in northwestern France.\n\nKufic is the oldest form of the Arabic script. The style emphasizes rigid and angular strokes, which appears as a modified form of the old Nabataean script. The Archaic Kufi consisted of about 17 letters without diacritic dots or accents. Afterward, dots and accents were added to help readers with pronunciation, and the set of Arabic letters rose to 28. It is developed around the end of the 7th century in the areas of Kufa, Iraq, from which it takes its name. The style later developed into several varieties, including floral, foliated, plaited or interlaced, bordered, and squared kufi. It was the main script used to copy Qur'ans from the 8th to 10th century and went out of general use in the 12th century when the flowing naskh style become more practical, although it continued to be used as a decorative element to contrast superseding styles.\n\nThere were no set rules of using the Kufic script; the only common feature is the angular, linear shapes of the characters. Due to the lack of methods, the scripts in different regions and countries and even down to the individuals themselves have different ways to write in the script creatively, ranging from very square and rigid forms to flowery and decorative.\n\nCommon varieties include square Kufic, a technique known as \"banna'i\". Contemporary calligraphy using this style is also popular in modern decorations.\n\nDecorative Kufic inscriptions are often imitated into pseudo-kufics in Middle age and Renaissance Europe. Pseudo-kufics is especially common in Renaissance depictions of people from the Holy Land. The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13–14th-century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during Jesus's time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them.\n\nThe use of cursive scripts coexisted with Kufic, but because in the early stages of their development they lacked discipline and elegance, cursive was usually used for informal purposes. With the rise of Islam, a new script was needed to fit the pace of conversions, and a well-defined cursive called naskh first appeared in the 10th century. The script is the most ubiquitous among other styles, used in Qur'ans, official decrees, and private correspondence. It became the basis of modern Arabic print.\n\nStandardization of the style was pioneered by Ibn Muqla (886 – 940 A.D.) and later expanded by Abu Hayan at-Tawhidi (died 1009 A.D.) and Muhammad Ibn Abd ar-Rahman (1492 – 1545 A.D.). Ibn Muqla is highly regarded in Muslim sources on calligraphy as the inventor of the naskh style, although this seems to be erroneous. However, Ibn Muqla did establish systematic rules and proportions for shaping the letters, which use 'alif as the x-height.\n\nVariation of the naskh includes:\n\nWith the spread of Islam, the Arabic script was established in a vast geographic area with many regions developing their own unique style. From the 14th century onward, other cursive styles began to develop in Turkey, Persia, and China.\n\nIn the post-colonial era, artists working in North Africa and the Middle East transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement, known as the \"Hurufiyya movement\". Artists working in this field use calligraphy as a graphic from within a contemporary artwork. \n\nThe term, \"hurifiyya\" is derived from the Arabic term, \"harf\" for letter. Traditionally, the term was charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. It is an explicit reference to a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos. \n\nHurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. Although hurufiyyah artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Islamic identity. \n\nThe hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa around 1955, in the area around Sudan, with the work of Ibrahim el-Salahi. However, the use of calligraphy in modern artworks appears to have emerged independently in various Islamic states. Few of the artists working in this field, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyyah to emerge in different regions. In Sudan, for instance, artworks include both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs. \n\nLeading exponents of hurufiyyah art can be found in Jordan. The Jordanian artist and art historian, Princess Wijdan Ali, for example, who revived the traditions of Arabic calligraphy in a modern, abstract, format. \n\nThe hurufiyyah art movement was not confined to painters, but also included artists working in a variety of media, such as the Jordanian ceramicist, Mahmoud Taha, who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship Nor was the movement confined to Jordan. In Iraq, the movement was known as \"Al Bu'd al Wahad\" (or the One Dimension Group)\", and in Iran, it was known as the Saqqa-Khaneh movement. \n\nWestern art has influenced Arabic calligraphy in other ways, with forms such as calligraffiti; the use of calligraphy in public art to make politico-social messages or to vandalise public buildings and spaces. Notable Islamic calligraffiti artists include: Yazan Halwani active in Lebanon, and A1one in Tehran and the Middle East. \n\nSome classical calligraphers:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University and was the author of many works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, in which he laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, among other ideas. He was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation and as \"one of the principal philosophers of mind of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. In addition to having exerted an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960, Fodor's work has had a significant impact on the development of the cognitive sciences.\"\n\nFodor argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\n\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or \"organs\", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the \"central processing\" part of the mind, which has a more global and less \"domain specific\" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.\n\nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.\n\nJerry Fodor was born in New York City on April 22, 1935, and was of Jewish descent. He received his A.B. degree (\"summa cum laude\") from Columbia University in 1956, where he studied with Sydney Morgenbesser, and a PhD in philosophy from Princeton University in 1960, under the direction of Hilary Putnam. From 1959 to 1986 Fodor was on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1986 to 1988 he was a full professor at the City University of New York (CUNY). From 1988 until his retirement in 2016 he was State of New Jersey Professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he was emeritus. Besides his interest in philosophy, Fodor passionately followed opera and regularly wrote popular columns for the \"London Review of Books\" on that and other topics.\n\nPhilosopher Colin McGinn, who taught with Fodor at Rutgers, described him in these words:\n\nFodor (who is a close friend) is a gentle man inside a burly body, and prone to an even burlier style of arguing. He is shy and voluble at the same time ... a formidable polemicist burdened with a sensitive soul... Disagreeing with Jerry on a philosophical issue, especially one dear to his heart, can be a chastening experience... His quickness of mind, inventiveness, and sharp wit are not to be tangled with before your first cup of coffee in the morning. Adding Jerry Fodor to the faculty at Rutgers [University] instantly put it on the map, Fodor being by common consent \"the leading philosopher of mind\" in the world today. I had met him in England in the seventies and ... found him to be the genuine article, intellectually speaking (though we do not always see eye to eye).\nFodor was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received numerous awards and honors: New York State Regent's Fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (Princeton University), Chancellor Greene Fellow (Princeton University), Fulbright Fellowship (University of Oxford), Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He won the first Jean Nicod Prize for philosophy of mind and cognitive philosophy in 1993. His lecture series for the Prize, later published as a book by MIT Press in 1995, was titled \"The Elm and the Expert: Mentalese and Its Semantics\". In 1996–1997, Fodor delivered the prestigious John Locke Lectures at the University of Oxford, titled \"Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong\", which went on to become his 1998 Oxford University Press book of the same name. He has also delivered the Patrick Romanell Lecture on Philosophical Naturalism (2004) and the Royce Lecture on Philosophy of Mind (2002) to the American Philosophical Association, of whose Eastern Division he has served as Vice President (2004–2005) and President (2005–2006). In 2005, he won the Mind & Brain Prize.\n\nHe lived in New York with his wife, the linguist Janet Dean Fodor, and had two children. Fodor died on November 29, 2017, at his home in Manhattan.\n\nIn his article \"Propositional Attitudes\" (1978), Fodor introduced the idea that mental states are relations between individuals and mental representations. Despite the changes in many of his positions over the years, the idea that intentional attitudes are relational has remained unchanged from its original formulation up to .\n\nIn that article, he attempted to show how mental representations, specifically sentences in the language of thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.\nFodor's own position, instead, is that to properly account for the nature of intentional attitudes, it is necessary to employ a \"three-place\" relation between individuals, representations and propositional contents.\n\nConsidering mental states as three-place relations in this way, representative realism makes it possible to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.\n\nFollowing in the path paved by linguist Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed a strong commitment to the idea of psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms also led him to the formulation of his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind.\n\nHistorically, questions about mental architecture have been divided into two contrasting theories about the nature of the faculties. The first can be described as a \"horizontal\" view because it sees mental processes as interactions between faculties which are not domain specific. For example, a judgment remains a judgment whether it is judgment about a perceptual experience or a judgment about the understanding of language. The second can be described as a \"vertical\" view because it claims that our mental faculties are domain specific, genetically determined, associated with distinct neurological structures, and so on.\n\nThe vertical vision can be traced back to the 19th century movement called phrenology and its founder Franz Joseph Gall. Gall claimed that mental faculties could be associated with specific physical areas of the brain. Hence, someone's level of intelligence, for example, could be literally \"read off\" from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe. This simplistic view of modularity has been disproved over the course of the last century.\n\nFodor revived the idea of modularity, without the notion of precise physical localizability, in the 1980s, and became one of the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph \"Modularity of Mind\". Two properties of modularity in particular, \"informational encapsulation\" and \"domain specificity\", make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.\n\nFodor's notions of mental modularity, informational encapsulation and domain specificity were taken up and expanded, much to Fodor's chagrin, by cognitive scientists such as Zenon Pylyshyn and evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker and Henry Plotkin, among many others. But Fodor complained that Pinker, Plotkin and other members of what he sarcastically called \"the New Synthesis\" have taken modularity and similar ideas way too far. He insisted that the mind is not \"massively modular\" and that, contrary to what these researchers would have us believe, the mind is still a very long way from having been explained by the computational, or any other, model.\n\nIn \"A Theory of Content and Other Essays\" (1990), Fodor takes up another of his central notions: the question of the reality of mental representations. Fodor needs to justify representational realism to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of the LOT.\n\nFodor starts with some criticisms of so-called \"standard realism\". This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts that there is an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.\n\nIn particular, Fodor criticizes the instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett. Dennett maintains that it is possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to the reality of mental representations. Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, then there is no possibility of explaining \"why\" the intentional strategy works:There is ... a standard objection to instrumentalism ...: it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs/desires works so well, if the psychology of beliefs/desires is, in fact, false... As Putnam, Boyd and others have emphasized, from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference; and this is even more likely when ... we are dealing with the \"only\" theory in play which is predictively crowned with success. It is not obvious ... why such a presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception ... of the interpretations of beliefs/desires.\n\nFodor also has \"positive\" arguments in favour of the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.\n\nProductivity refers to a representational system's unbounded ability to generate new representations from a given set of symbols. \"John\", \"loves\", and \"Mary\" allow for the construction of the sentences \"John loves Mary\" and \"Mary loves John\". Fodor's language of thought theorizes that representations are decomposable into constituent parts, and these decomposed representations are built into new strings.\n\nMore important than productivity is systematicity since it does not rely on questionable idealizations about human cognition. The argument states that a cognizer is able to understand some sentence in virtue of understanding another. For example, no one who understands \"John loves Mary\" is unable to understand \"Mary loves John\", and no one who understands \"P and Q\" is unable to understand \"P\". Systematicity itself is rarely challenged as a property of natural languages and logics, but some challenge that thought is systematic in the same way languages are. Still others from the connectionist tradition have tried to build non-classical networks that can account for the apparent systematicity of language.\n\nThe fact that systematicity and productivity depend on the compositional structure of language means that language has a combinatorial semantics. If thought also has such a combinatorial semantics, then there must be a language of thought.\n\nThe second argument that Fodor provides in favour of representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on the relation between the representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations goes hand in hand with the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the \"form\" of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.\n\nFor Fodor, this formal notion of thought processes also has the advantage of highlighting the parallels between the causal role of symbols and the contents which they express. In his view, syntax plays the role of mediation between the causal role of the symbols and their contents. The semantic relations between symbols can be \"imitated\" by their syntactic relations. The inferential relations which connect the \"contents\" of two symbols can be imitated by the formal syntax rules which regulate the derivation of one symbol from another.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 1980s, Fodor adhered to a causal notion of mental content and of meaning. This idea of content contrasts sharply with the inferential role semantics to which he subscribed earlier in his career. Fodor criticizes inferential role semantics (IRS) because its commitment to an extreme form of holism excludes the possibility of a true naturalization of the mental. But naturalization must include an explanation of content in atomistic and causal terms.\n\nFodor has made many and varied criticisms of holism. He identifies the central problem with all the different notions of holism as the idea that the determining factor in semantic evaluation is the notion of an \"epistemic bond\". Briefly, P is an epistemic bond of Q if the meaning of P is considered by someone to be relevant for the determination of the meaning of Q. Meaning holism strongly depends on this notion. The identity of the content of a mental state, under holism, can only be determined by the \"totality\" of its epistemic bonds. And this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility:If people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance, and if we follow the holism of meaning and individuate intentional states by way of the \"totality\" of their epistemic bonds, the consequence will be that two people (or, for that matter, two temporal sections of the same person) will never be in the same intentional state. Therefore, two people can never be subsumed under the same intentional generalizations. And, therefore, intentional generalization can never be successful. And, therefore again, there is no hope for an intentional psychology.\n\nHaving criticized the idea that semantic evaluation concerns only the internal relations between the units of a symbolic system, Fodor can adopt an externalist position with respect to mental content and meaning. For Fodor, in recent years, the problem of naturalization of the mental is tied to the possibility of giving \"the sufficient conditions for which a piece of the world is relative to (expresses, represents, is true of) another piece\" in non-intentional and non-semantic terms. If this goal is to be achieved within a representational theory of the mind, then the challenge is to devise a causal theory which can establish the interpretation of the primitive non-logical symbols of the LOT. Fodor's initial proposal is that what determines that the symbol for \"water\" in Mentalese expresses the property HO is that the occurrences of that symbol are in certain causal relations with water. The intuitive version of this causal theory is what Fodor calls the \"Crude Causal Theory\". According to this theory, the occurrences of symbols express the properties which are the causes of their occurrence. The term \"horse\", for example, says of a horse that it is a horse. In order to do this, it is necessary and sufficient that certain properties of an occurrence of the symbol \"horse\" be in a law-like relation with certain properties which determine that something is an occurrence of \"horse\".\n\nThe main problem with this theory is that of erroneous representations. There are two unavoidable problems with the idea that \"a symbol expresses a property if it is ... necessary that all and only the presences of such a property cause the occurrences\". The first is that not \"all\" horses cause occurrences of \"horse\". The second is that not \"only\" horses cause occurrences of \"horse.\" Sometimes the \"A\"(\"horses\") are caused by A (horses), but at other times—when, for example, because of the distance or conditions of low visibility, one has confused a cow for a horse—the \"A\" (\"horses\") are caused by B (cows). In this case the symbol \"A\" doesn’t express just the property A, but the disjunction of properties A or B. The crude causal theory is therefore incapable of distinguishing the case in which the content of a symbol is disjunctive from the case in which it isn’t. This gives rise to what Fodor calls the \"problem of disjunction\".\n\nFodor responds to this problem with what he defines as \"a slightly less crude causal theory\". According to this approach, it is necessary to break the symmetry at the base of the crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of \"A\" caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, is that while the false cases are \"ontologically dependent\" on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (\"A\"= A) and the false ones (\"A\" = A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:From the point of view of semantics, errors must be \"accidents\": if in the extension of \"horse\" there are no cows, then it cannot be required for the meaning of \"horse\" that cows be called horses. On the other hand, if \"horse\" did not mean that which it means, and if it were an error for horses, it would never be possible for a cow to be called \"horse\". Putting the two things together, it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying \"this is a horse\" presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly, but not vice versa. If we put this in terms of the crude causal theory, the fact that cows cause one to say \"horse\" depends on the fact that horses cause one to say \"horse\"; but the fact that horses cause one to say \"horse\" does \"not\" depend on the fact that cows cause one to say \"horse\"...\n\nDuring the 1960s, various philosophers such as Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam, and Fodor tried to resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so-called \"folk psychology\" while adhering to a materialist vision of the world which did not violate the \"generality of physics\". Their proposal was, first of all, to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind: behaviorism and the type identity theory. The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation \"between\" mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation, especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event/cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events/causes. The type-identity theory, on the other hand, failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state. Besides being deeply anthropocentric (why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe?), the identity-type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others. Hence, the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species.\nOne can solve these problems, according to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis which was designed to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate (\"realize\") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of \"token materialism\".\n\nFodor co-authored the book \"What Darwin Got Wrong\" (2010) with the biolinguist Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini in which they describe neo-Darwinists as being \"distressingly uncritical\" and say of Darwin's theory of evolution that \"it overestimates the contribution the environment makes in shaping the phenotype of a species and correspondingly underestimates the effects of endogenous variables.\" Evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne describes this book as \"a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection\" and \"as biologically uninformed as it is strident\". Moral philosopher and anti-scientism author Mary Midgley praises \"What Darwin Got Wrong\" as \"an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo-Darwinist simplicities\". The book also received positive review by mathematician and Intelligent Design Theorist William Dembski.\n\nA wide variety of philosophers of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis has been accused of either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for \"it\" to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of \"this\" representational substrate and so on, \"ad infinitum\"? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it does not have to be learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.\n\nIn 1981 Daniel Dennett had formulated another argument against the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, on the basis of the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as \"It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left.\" We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually \"thinking\" or \"believing\" somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude \"I believe I can kick this guy's butt\" in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as \"desiring to breathe clear air\" in a stuffy environment.\n\nSome linguists and philosophers of language have criticized Fodor's self-proclaimed \"extreme\" concept nativism. Kent Bach, for example, takes Fodor to task for his criticisms of lexical semantics and polysemy. Fodor claims that there is no lexical structure to such verbs as \"keep\", \"get\", \"make\" and \"put\". He suggests that, alternatively, \"keep\" simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, \"keep your clothes on\", \"keep your receipt\" and \"keep washing your hands\" will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes on or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, \"differently\", to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of \"fast\" in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of pragmatic inference, is a matter of debate. Fodor's own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in \"Concepts\": \"People sometimes used to say that \"exist\" must be ambiguous because look at the difference between 'chairs exist' and 'numbers exist'. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. Since you have the latter to explain the former, you don't also need 'exist' to be polysemic.\"\n\nSome critics find it difficult to accept Fodor's insistence that a large, perhaps implausible, number of concepts are primitive and undefinable. For example, Fodor considers such concepts as EFFECT, ISLAND, TRAPEZOID, and WEEK to be all primitive, innate and unanalyzable because they all fall into the category of what he calls \"lexical concepts\" (those for which our language has a single word). Against this view, Bach argues that the concept VIXEN is almost certainly composed out of the concepts FEMALE and FOX, BACHELOR out of SINGLE and MALE, and so on.\n\nOne of his critics, Fiona Cowie, says that Fodor's innatism is \"indicative of a certain degree of pessimism as to our prospects for understanding how a mind comes to be furnished,\" it just has the furniture it has.\n\n\n\n"}

He lived and worked in Lithuania Minor, a territory in the Kingdom of Prussia, that had a sizable Lithuanian-speaking minority. He wrote the first classic Lithuanian language poem, \"The Seasons\" (), which became one of the principal works of Lithuanian poetry. The poem, a classic work of Lithuanian literature, depicts everyday life of Lithuanian peasants, their struggle with serfdom, and the annual cycle of life.\n\nDonelaitis was born at Lasdinehlen estate near Gumbinnen, East Prussia. His parents were free peasants who owned the land that they cultivated. His father died in 1720, leaving seven children (4 sons and 3 daughters). One of his three brothers, Friedrich, became a goldsmith in Königsberg. Another brother, Michael, inherited the father's farm. His third brother, Adam, became a blacksmith and innkeeper.\n\nIn 1731, Donelaitis began attending the cathedral school in Kneiphof, a section of Königsberg. He lived in a pauper's dormitory and often went hungry for days. After graduation, he received a scholarship in 1736 to study at the University of Königsberg. For four years he studied Lutheran theology. His world view was shaped by the classical curriculum, required Lithuanian studies, and the Pietism movement. He learned the Greek, Latin, French, and Hebrew languages, and studied the writings of classical authors such as Homer, Hesiod, Horace, and Virgil. After graduation, he was appointed as a cantor in Stallupönen(Lithuanian: Stalupėnai) (now Nesterov, Kaliningrad Oblast). After the school rector died, Donelaitis took over his position. In 1743, he passed the required examination to become a pastor in Tollmingkehmen(Lithuanian: Tolminkiemis) (now Chistye Prudy, Kaliningrad Oblast).\n\nDonelaitis lived in Tollmingkehmen from 1743 to his death in 1780. At the time, the parish of Tollmingkehmen had around 30 villages with around 3,000 residents. The population was about two-thirds German and one-third Lithuanian. In 1744 Donelaitis married Anna Regina Ohlefant, widow of the school rector in Stallupönen. In 1747, he worked to restore the rectory, and built a new brick church in 1756. In 1757, during the Seven Years' War, Donelaitis and his parishioners retreated to the Romincka Forest to hide from Russian invaders. When he returned to the town, Donelaitis refused to preach praises to the Russian Tsar. After the war he rebuilt a burned school and sponsored construction of a shelter to widows. His hobbies included building thermometers and barometers, and constructing pianos and clavichords. He died, aged 66, in Tollmingkehmen, East Prussia.\n\nNone of Donelaitis' works were published during his lifetime. Donelaitis wrote at least three poems in the German language (\"An der Amstrath Donalitius nach dem Verlust seiner Gattin\", \"Der Gott der Finsterniss\", and \"Unschuld sei mein ganzes Leben\"). His Lithuanian works consist of six fables and the poem \"The Seasons\". Donelaitis' publisher, Ludwig Rhesa, believed that the fables, based on Aesop's Fables, were written for his students in Stallupönen. Their language and poetic rhythm are not as well-developed as in his later works.\n\nHis major work, \"The Seasons\", was titled by Rheza. It consisted of four idylls, totaling 2,997 hexameters. The work was a long-term project, often revised and rewritten, without a clear beginning or ending. Only two original idylls survive. The other two were destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars. The full work is known from a copy made by Pastor Hohlfeldt after 1794. Between 1809 and 1818, Rheza collected Donelaitis' works, edited and translated them, and finally published it as \"Das jahr in vier Gesängen\". It was a heavily edited and censored edition, containing only about one sixth of the original poem. In 1824, Rheza also published the fables. A fuller publication of \"The Seasons\" was prepared by August Schleicher in 1865, but this edition was criticized by Georg H. F. Nesselmann, who prepared an edition in 1869.\n\nK.Donelaitis and his works are important part of Lithuanian culture and led to creation of literature and music works based on Donelaitis' life and his poem \"Seasons\".\nIn Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre in 1985 opera \"Kristijonas\" by Algimantas Bražinskas was performed.\n\n"}

For example, the language of even-length palindromes on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the linear grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string. This language is nondeterministic. Since nondeterministic context-free languages cannot be accepted in linear time, linear languages cannot be accepted in linear time in the general case. Furthermore, it is undecidable whether a given context-free language is a linear context-free language.\n\nIf \"L\" is a linear language and \"M\" is a regular language, then the intersection formula_2 is again a linear language; in other words, the linear languages are closed under intersection with regular sets. Furthermore, the linear languages are closed under homomorphism and inverse homomorphism. These three closure properties show that the linear languages form a full trio. Full trios in general are language families that enjoy a couple of other desirable mathematical properties.\n"}

The MW qualification is generally regarded in the wine industry as one of the highest standards of professional knowledge.\n\nThe Institute was founded in 1955, but the MW examinations were first arranged in 1953 by the Worshipful Company of Vintners and the Wine and Spirits Association.\n\nThe Institute of Masters of Wine is a non-profit organization funded by its members and by corporate sponsorship from within the wine industry. Its stated objectives are:\n\nBefore enrolling in the MW study programme, prospective students must hold an advanced wine qualification, at least Diploma level from the Wine & Spirit Education Trust, or an appropriately high level sommelier certificate, such as Advanced Sommelier from the Court of Master Sommeliers. Also, prospective students need to have a minimum of three years' professional work experience in the global wine community. Applicants must submit a basic essay, a tasting paper, a brief statement explaining their interest in becoming a Master of Wine, and a reference to support their application, from a Master of Wine or another senior wine trade professional. \n\nThe study programme is made up of three stages. Stage 1 is the foundation year and gives students the opportunity to meet Masters of Wine and fellow students in both professional and social settings. Stage 1 assessment includes six pieces of work throughout the year, culminating in an exam that takes place in early June. The exam involves one tasting paper and two essays. Stage 2 is a crucial time for students - it can be very intense but immensely rewarding. Students must provide three pieces of work for assessment throughout the Stage 2 year, and must pass both the Theory and Practical parts of the June MW Examination in order to progress to the Research Paper in Stage 3. The Research paper is an individual paper of between 6,000 and 10,000 words in length, on a topic of the student's choice. The whole qualification takes at least three years to complete in full.\n\nUntil 1983, the examination was limited to United Kingdom wine importers, merchants and retailers. The first non-UK Master of Wine was awarded in 1988. As of October 2017, there are 369 MWs in the world, living in 29 countries. The MWs are spread across 5 continents, wherein UK has 208 MWs, USA has 45 MWs, Australia has 24 MWs and France only has 16 MWs. There are 9 countries with 1 MW each on the list. \n\nToday, members hold a range of occupations including winemakers, viticulturists, winemaking consultants, wine writers and journalists, wine educators, and wine service, restaurant and hotel management. In addition, many are involved in the purchasing, importing, distribution, sales and marketing of wine. Typically, sommeliers choose to become Master Sommelier, but only a handful of individuals have achieved both qualifications.\n\nNotable Masters of Wine include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34815778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34815778", "title": "Miller twist rule", "text": "Miller twist rule\n\nMiller twist rule is a mathematical formula created by Don Miller to calculate the optimum rate of twist for a given bullet traveling through a rifled barrel. Miller suggests that while Greenhill's formula works well there are better and more precise ways to calculate what the proper twist rate for a bullet should be that are not much more difficult to calculate.\n\nThe following formula is one recommended by Miller.\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere:\n\nGiven those definitions we can expand:\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere formula_3 = twist in inches per turn, and\n\nformula_4\n\nwhere formula_5 = bullet length in inches.\n\nUsing Miller's formula we can also calculate the stability factor assuming we already know the twist. Simply solve for formula_6.\n\nformula_7\n\nIt is possible to solve for twist in inches/turn directly by solving for formula_3\n\nformula_9\n\nNote that the constant 30 is Miller roughly approximating the velocity as 2800 ft/sec, standard temperature (59 degrees Fahrenheit), and pressure (750 mm Hg and 78% humidity) in the equation. Miller states that these values are taken from the Army Standard Metro but does note that his values are slightly off. He goes on to point out that the difference should be small enough that it can be ignored.\n\nIt should also be noted that the bullet density is missing from Miller's formula despite the fact that Miller himself states his formula expands upon Greenhill's. The bullet density in the equation above is implicit in formula_10 through the moment of inertia approximation.\n\nFinally, note that the denominator in Miller's equation is based upon the relative shape of a modern bullet. formula_11 is roughly the formula for the shape of an American football.\n\nWhen computing this formula Miller states several \"safe\" values that can be used in place of some of the more difficult to determine variables. For example, he states that assuming a mach number of formula_12 = 2.5 (or roughly 2800 ft/sec assuming standard conditions at sea level where 1 Mach is roughly 1116 ft/sec) is a safe value to use in regards to velocity. He also states that rough estimates that involve temperature should use formula_6 = 2.0.\n\nIf we take the Nosler Spitzer .30-06 Springfield round, which is similar to the one pictured above, we can easily fill in the variables and calculate the estimated twist rate. Starting with the formula\n\nformula_14\n\nWe then fill in:\n\nformula_15\n\nWhich tells us we have 39.2511937 calibers per turn. We calculate formula_3 using formula_17 and see that\n\nformula_18\n\nSo our rifling should be roughly 12\" per turn. The average twist of .30-06 caliber rifles is 10 inches per turn, so 12 inches per turn is fairly accurate. The discrepancy seen here also helps explain why certain bullets seem to work better in certain rifles when fired under similar conditions.\n\nGreenhill's formula is actually much more complicated in full form. The rule of thumb that Greenhill devised based upon his formula is actually what is seen in most places, including Wikipedia. That rule was:\n\nformula_19\n\nThe actual formula was:\n\nformula_20\n\nwhere:\n\nThus, Miller, in essence, took Greenhill's rule of thumb and expanded it slightly while, at the same time, keeping the formula simple enough to calculate without advanced training in mathematics. To improve on Greenhill, Miller used mostly empirical data and some basic geometry.\n\nMiller, in his work, notes several corrective equations that can be used:\n\nThe velocity (formula_22) correction for twist (formula_3): formula_24\n\nThe velocity (formula_22) correction for stability factor (formula_6): formula_27\n\nThe altitude (formula_28) correction under standard conditions: formula_29 where formula_30 is altitude in feet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2424112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2424112", "title": "Networked book", "text": "Networked book\n\nA networked book is an open book designed to be written, edited, and read in a networked environment. It is also a platform for social exchange, and is potentially linked to other books and other discussions. Wikipedia can be considered a networked book.\n\nThe networked book has four primary characteristics: \n\nThe networked book maintains an open structure during all or part of its creation. For example, Lawrence Lessig's, \"\" used a wiki to open the editing process for the second edition of \"Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace,\" in order to \"draw upon the creativity and knowledge of the community. This is an online, collaborative book update; a first of its kind. Once the project nears completion, Professor Lessig will take the contents of this wiki and ready it for publication.\" In other words, at some point the book was declared finished, and closed to further input and adjustment by the community. Another example of an open book structure is the popular Wikipedia. This online wiki encyclopedia is entirely and \"indefinitely\" open.\n\nAnother example of a networked book is Turbulence.org's 2009 commissioned anthology, . The website explores writing, art, and culture in networked society, and explores the subject on multiple levels. In addition to the thematic matter, the initial commissioned authors were invited to submit chapters using a blog or wiki format. While seven of the authors chose the blog format (with the CommentPress plugin), artist/theorist Patrick Lichty created a wiki-formatted chapter, \"Art in the Age of Dataflow\", which discusses literary theories of spatial narrative from its inception in the 1940s to the age of big data. Like Lawrence Lessig's text, Dataflow was intended as a propositional text from which the online community expand on the original chapter. The chapter as it existed in 2012 was captured and included in Lichty's Institute for Networked Culture book, \"Variant Analyses, Interrogations of New Media Art and Culture\".\n\nThe networked book manifests a certain \"disarticulation of the body of text\" and \"disaggregated/reaggregated\" structure as described by Raffaele Simone in his essay, \"The Body of the Text.\" \"Disarticulation of the body of the text occurs when the text generated by an author is not perceived as closed to external interventions, an entity to which the author can have access only to read (or, to use an information science image, in the manner of ROM, that is \"read only\"), but as an open entity to which one has access—for purposes of both reading and writing. When the text is disarticulated it is perceived as an entity which can be disaggregated (broken apart), manipulated, and reaggregated (reassembled) without damaging the text per se or the author.\"\n\nThe networked book is a form that helps us reconstruct and understand the prolific and increasingly granular world of information that surrounds us. Moreover, the networked book sets up formats that are often designed to update continually, incorporating new information and reconfiguring the book to accommodate new content and present it coherently.\n\nJonathan Harris' \"10 x 10\" builds its content from RSS feeds. The piece selects the most frequently used words from the major news networks to assemble an hourly \"portrait\" of our world. This visualization tool represents a type of structure that we will soon see in networked books. The human editor/programmer creates the search and visualization function and the machine then collects, edits, and presents text and images according to criteria built into the program. This type of \"book\" format depends on granular content that can be \"manipulated and reaggregated\" by a tool.\n\nSocial software environments create spaces for communal authorship. They allow raw, unedited content to be collectively assembled within the nascent form of the electronic book itself, facilitating a gestational space for content to evolve from spontaneous discussion into an edited \"book\" according to the activity of the social network. LiveJournal is a useful model for socially networked books.\n\nThe multiple-author forum creates a different kind of thinking environment. Individual points of view are mediated by multiple voices. This may allow for a more democratic approach to issues and a multifaceted rendering of topics not possible in the single-author print model.\n\nThe future book will be a networked book or a \"processed book\" as Joseph Esposito calls it. To process a book, he says, is more than simply building links to it; processing also includes a modification of the act of creation, which tends to encourage the absorption of the book into a network of applications, including but not restricted to commentary. This \"processing\" creates iterations of the book: critiques, revisions and trajectories that accumulate around the original draft. The iterations of Wikipedia are a good example of this principle. The networked book, as a process-based knowledge machine incorporates the thinking \"process\" of multiple authors.\n\nIt is useful, in this case, to compare the processing of a networked book to the standard editorial procedures found in print culture. Both print books and networked books originate from an idea conceived by a senior editor or an author. However, the participatory framework of a networked book is articulated by a designer, and executed by a programmer, before the content is written or assembled, thus creating an open book structure. Paper-based books are turned over to the designer, production artist and printer after the content is finished, resulting in a closed book structure. The networked book is assembled, in whole or in part, by a community of authors according to the thesis imagined by the editor/author and within the space created by the designer and programmer. The community of contributors acts as both author and reader, which is drastically different from the single-author print model wherein, reader is audience rather than co-creator. In a networked book, content is generated and revised by the community and the various iterations of the text are often saved and can be returned to and discussed. In a paper-based book, content is generally constructed by a single author and is revised under the supervision of an editor. The readers have no part in this process and the revisions are only examined and debated in special cases, and then usually by scholars or authors, not by the general readership. After the content has been generated by the community within the framework of the network book's thesis and architecture, the reader/editor implements strategies for marking out meaningful pathways through the material using search engines and visualization applications.\n\n\n"}

Literally, the phrase means \"avoid being unclear\" or \"avoid being unclear, support being clear\", but the use of relatively uncommon words causes confusion in much of the audience (those lacking the vocabulary), making the statement an example of irony, and more precisely a heterological phrase. The phrase has appeared in print at least as early as 1959, when it was used as a section heading in a NASA document.\n\nAn earlier similar phrase appears in Mark Twain's \"Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses\", where he lists rule fourteen of good writing as \"eschew surplusage\".\n\nIn white-box cryptography, obfuscation refers to the protection of cryptographic keys from extraction when they are under the control of the adversary, e.g., as part of a DRM scheme.\n\nIn network security, obfuscation refers to methods used to obscure an attack payload from inspection by network protection systems.\n"}

For example, there are multiple sections of an orchestra. The strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion sections all have subsections. The first violins, second violins, violas, cellos, double basses, flutes, clarinets, oboes, bassoons, trumpets, trombones, French horns, tubas, and percussion are all subsections, each possessing a principal musician. Most musical ensembles possess some variety of subsection, with each subsection having a principal player. The principal for each section is the most talented and valuable player. The principal is usually decided with a rigorous audition process. \n\nNot only does a principal lead each section with their talented playing, they lead with verbal and physical communication. Verbally, principals must communicate directions from the conductor to the rest of their section. String principals must communicate direction of bowings as well as any changes in direction of bowings. \n\nPrincipals also verbally communicate to their section specific notes that sound wrong, or sections in the music that need practicing, in order to maintain the performance level of their section. Physically, sections look to the principal for entrance cues, expression, and intensity. \n\nIn addition to leading the section, principal musicians play all of the solos written for their instrument in any given piece. The principal first violin is called the concertmaster (or \"leader\" in the UK) and is considered the leader of not only the string section, but of the entire orchestra, subordinate only to the conductor.\n"}

The romanization of Hebrew is the use of the Latin alphabet to transliterate Hebrew words.\n\nFor example, the Hebrew name spelled (\"Israel\") in the Hebrew alphabet can be romanized as ' or ' in the Latin alphabet.\n\nRomanization includes any use of the Latin alphabet to transliterate Hebrew words. Usually it is to identify a Hebrew word in a non-Hebrew language that uses the Latin alphabet, such as German, Spanish, Turkish, and so on. Transliteration uses an alphabet to represent the letters and sounds of a word spelled in another alphabet, whereas transcription uses an alphabet to represent the sounds only. Romanization can do both.\n\nTo go the other way, that is from English to Hebrew, see Hebraization of English. Both Hebraization of English and Romanization of Hebrew are forms of transliteration. Where these are formalized these are known as \"transliteration systems\", and, where only some words, not all, are transliterated, this is known as \"transliteration policy\".\n\nTransliteration assumes two different script systems. The use of a French word in English without translation, such as \"bourgeois\", is not transliteration. The use of a Hindi word in English such as \"khaki\" (originally खाकी) is transliteration. Transliteration of a foreign word into another language is usually the exception to translation, and often occurs when there is something distinctive about the word in the original language, such as a double entendre, uniqueness, religious, cultural or political significance, or it may occur to add local flavour.\n\nIn the cases of Hebrew transliteration into English, many Hebrew words have a long history of transliteration, for example Amen, Satan, ephod, Urim and Thummim have traditionally been transliterated, not translated. These terms were in many cases also first transliterated into Greek and Latin before English.\n\nDifferent publishers have different transliteration policies. For example ArtScroll publications generally transliterate more words relative to sources such as the Jewish Encyclopedia 1911, or Jewish Publication Society texts.\n\nThere are various transliteration standards or systems for Hebrew-to-English; no one system has significant common usage across all fields. Consequently in general usage there are often no hard and fast rules in Hebrew-to-English transliteration, and many transliterations are an approximation due to lack of equivalence between the English and Hebrew alphabets. Conflicting systems of transliteration often appear in the same text, as certain Hebrew words tend to associate with certain traditions of transliteration. For example,\n\nThis text includes instances of the same word transliterated in different ways: The Hebrew word is transliterated as both \"Beith\" and \"Bet\".\n\nThese discrepancies in transliterations of the same word can be traced to discrepancies in the transliterations of individual Hebrew letters, reflecting not only different traditions of transliteration into different languages that use Latin alphabets, but also the fact that different pronunciation styles exist for the same letters in Israel (e.g. mainstream secular Ashkenazi pronunciations used in the media versus Mizrahi, Arab, or Orthodox Ashkenazi colloquial pronunciations). For example, \"Hanukkah\" and \"Chayyim\" are transliterated with different initial letter combinations, although in Hebrew both begin with the letter ; the use of \"ch\" reflects German / Yiddish influence and pronunciation, whereas the \"h\" or \"ḥ\" may indicate a softer pronunciation of as in ancient Hebrew, Judeo-Arabic or Mizrahi Hebrew. Similarly, the Hebrew letter is transliterated as \"th\" in the word \"Beith\", \"s\" in the word \"talis\", and \"t\" in the word \"Bet\", even though it is the same letter in all three words in Hebrew. The Hebrew letter is transliterated as \"c\" in \"Isaac\", \"k\" in \"Yitzchak\", and \"q\" in \"Qehila\". Finally, the Hebrew letter is transliterated variously as \"s\" (in \"Isaac\"), \"tz\" (in \"Yitzchak\"), and \"ts\" (in \"Tsfat\"), again reflecting different traditions of spelling or pronunciation. These inconsistencies make it more difficult for the non-Hebrew-speaking reader to recognize related word forms, or even to properly pronounce the Hebrew words thus transliterated.\n\nEarly romanization of Hebrew occurred with the contact between the Romans and the Jews. It was influenced by earlier transliteration into the Greek language. For example, the name of the Roman province of Iudaea (63 BCE) was apparently derived from the Greek words (Iouda) and (Ioudaia). These words can be seen in Chapter 1 of Esdras (Ezra) in the Septuagint, a Hellenistic translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek. The Greek words in turn are transliterations of the Hebrew word (\"Yehuda\") that we now know adapted in English as the names Judah, Judas and Jude.\n\nIn the 1st century, Satire 14 of Juvenal uses the Hebraic words \"sabbata\", \"Iudaicum\", and \"Moyses\", apparently adopted from the Greek.\n\nThe 4th-century and 5th-century Latin translations of the Hebrew Bible romanize its proper names. The familiar Biblical names in English are derived from these romanizations. The Vulgate, of the early 5th century, is considered the first direct Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible. Apart from names, another term that the Vulgate romanizes is the technical term \"mamzer\" ().\n\nWith the rise of Zionism, some Jews promoted the use of romanization instead of Hebrew script in hopes of helping more people learn Hebrew. One such promoter was Ithamar Ben Yehuda, or Ittamar Ben Avi as he styled himself. His father Eliezer Ben Yehuda raised him to be the first modern native speaker of Hebrew. In 1927 Ben-Avi published the biography \"Avi\" in romanized Hebrew (now listed in the online catalog of the Jewish National and University Library). However, the innovation did not catch on.\n\nPolitical activist Ze'ev Jabotinsky, leader of Betar, and Chief Rabbi Kook, also expressed their support for the reform of Hebrew script using Latin letters.\n\nRomanized Hebrew can be used to present Hebrew terminology or text to anyone who is not familiar with the Hebrew script. Many Jewish prayer books include supplementary romanization for some or all of the Hebrew-language congregational prayers.\n\nRomanized Hebrew is also used for Hebrew-language items in library catalogs and Hebrew-language place names on maps. In Israel, most catalogs and maps use the Hebrew script, but romanized maps are easily available and road signs include romanized names. Some Hebrew speakers use romanization to communicate when using internet systems that have poor support for the Hebrew alphabet. Romanized Hebrew is also used in music scores, in part because music is written left-to-right and Hebrew is written right-to-left.\n\nStandard romanizations exist for these various purposes. However, non-standard romanization is widely seen, even on some Israeli street signs. The standards are not generally taught outside of their specific organizations and disciplines.\n\n\nThe following table is a breakdown of each letter in the Hebrew alphabet, describing its name or names, and its Latin script transliteration values used in academic work. If two glyphs are shown for a consonant, then the left-most glyph is the final form of the letter (or right-most glyph if your browser doesn't support right-to-left text layout). The conventions here are ISO 259, the UNGEGN system based on the old-fashioned Hebrew Academy system, and the modern common informal Israeli transcription. In addition, an International Phonetic Alphabet pronunciation is indicated—historical (Tiberian vocalization) for ISO 259, prescribed for Hebrew Academy, and in practice for Israeli. For the vowels further down, the letters ח and ט are used as symbolic anchors for vowel symbols, but should otherwise be ignored.\n\nFor the letters with dagesh in ISO 259 Classical Hebrew and by the Hebrew Academy standard, they are transcribed as single graphemes (b g d k p t) at the beginnings of words, after other consonants, and after shewa ְ  or ẖatafim ֱ  ֲ  ֳ . In almost every other situation, they are transcribed as double letters (bb gg dd kk pp tt). This does not apply to common Israeli Hebrew transliteration, where there are no double consonants.\n\nThe letters at the ends of words without additional niqqud are silent and not transliterated. The letter at the end of a word with ẖolam ֹ  is also silent and not transliterated. The letter at the end of a word after ẖiriq ִ  is also silent and not transliterated. The situation of the letter at the end of a word after ẕere ֵ  or seggol ֶ  is more complicated, as they are silent in Classical Hebrew and in Hebrew Academy prescription and not transliterated in those systems, but they form diphthongs (ei) in Israeli Hebrew—see the vowels and diphthongs sections further down. In any event, the shewa naẖ is placed between two adjacent consonants in all situations; if there is not even a shewa naẖ between consonants, then the first of the two consonants is silent and not transliterated—this is usually one of , but even occasionally and rarely (in the name Issachar) are encountered silent in this fashion. In Israeli Hebrew transcription, a vowel before yud at the end of a word or before yud then shewa naẖ inside a word, is transcribed as a diphthong (ai oi ui)—see the diphthongs section further down.\n\nIn Classical Hebrew transliteration, vowels can be long (gāḏōl), short (qāṭān) or ultra short (ḥăṭep̄), and are transliterated as such. Ultra short vowels are always one of šəwā nāʻ ְ , ḥăṭep̄ səḡōl ֱ , ḥăṭep̄ páṯaḥ ֲ  or ḥăṭep̄ qāmeṣ ֳ . Šəwā ְ  is \"always\" always šəwā nāʻ (pronounced) if it's immediately after the word's first consonant, or after a consonant after a long vowel and before another pronounced consonant—otherwise, šəwā is realized as šəwā nāḥ (silent). The vowels ṣērē ֵ  and ḥōlem ֹ  are always long in all situations. The vowels ḥīreq ִ , səḡōl ֶ , páṯaḥ ַ , qāmeṣ ָ , qibbūṣ ֻ  and šūreq   are always long if they are the stressed syllable, or if they are in a syllable before only one consonant and another vowel, and in these cases they are transliterated as long. If they are unstressed and before a double consonant or a consonant cluster, or in the word's final \"unstressed\" syllable, then they are always short and transliterated as short. But if a vowel carries an accent ֫  or a meteg ֽ , then it is always long—a meteg in particular is often used in places where a vowel is long but not necessarily the word's stressed syllable. Lastly, there are exceptional circumstances when long vowels—even ṣērē and ḥōlem—may not force a following šəwā to become šəwā nāʻ, including for example names such as Gēršōm (not Gērəšōm as it might seem), Bēlšaṣṣạr (not Bēləšaṣṣạr) and Ṣīqlạḡ (not Ṣīqəlạḡ). Some of these seem to be learned exceptions, and most words under the same circumstances have šəwā nāʻ as expected, such as Nāṣərạṯ (not Nāṣrạṯ). (This is \"all\" moot in Israeli Hebrew, where, as already mentioned, shva nach tends to opportunistically replace shva na where comfortable, so is Natzrat not Natzerat, etc.)\n\nFor the vowel qamaẕ ָ, whether the vowel is long or short in Classical Hebrew affects the pronunciation in Academy or Israeli Hebrew, even though vowel length is not phonemic in those systems, and the difference is transliterated accordingly. Qamaẕ qatan when short is /o/, except when at the end of a word when not before a final consonant, in which case it is /a/. Qamaẕ gadol is \"usually\" /a/, but in rare situations in Classical Hebrew it can be treated as a long open /ọ/, which although pronounced identically to /ā/ (both were ), this a/o distinction is clearly made in the pronunciation of Academy and Israeli Hebrew, and is thus transliterated.\n\nIf any word ends with one of , then the vowel pataẖ is pronounced \"before\" the consonant, not after as it is written, and so the \"transliterated\" sequence is /ah/, /aẖ/, /aʻ/, etc.\n\nIn certain rare words that are meant to begin with two consecutive consonants even in Classical Hebrew, an invisible səḡōl qāṭān vowel is pronounced before the two consonants in Classical Hebrew and is so transcribed, because Classical words may not begin with more than one consonant. This rule does not apply to Academy and Israeli Hebrew, where consonant clusters are more tolerated. For example, the word (\"two\") would appear as štáyim, but is actually ʼeštáyim. However, it remains simply shtayim in Academy and Israeli Hebrew.\n\nIn 2006, the Hebrew Academy replaced their 1953 transliteration rules with new rules, and these were adopted as a United Nations standard in 2007. , migration to the new transliteration standard is still underway, and many signs and documents still use the 1953 conventions. The new 2006 rules attempt to more closely follow Israeli Hebrew vowel habits (such as the collapse of many shva na), but stop short of adopting most of the informal transliteration patterns. It still transliterates the diphthong as /e/, and it still transliterates separate /ẖ/ and /kh/ in all cases. It is unspecific about rules governing the transliteration of phonemes not traditionally native to Hebrew.\n\nDifferent purposes call for different choices of romanization. One extreme is to make a phonetic transcription of one person's speech on one occasion.\n\nIn Israel, a pronunciation known as General Israeli Hebrew or Standard Hebrew is widely used and documented. For Israeli speech and text where linguistic groups are not at issue, romanization can use a phonetic transcription according to Standard Hebrew pronunciation. However, there are many Israeli groups with differing pronunciations of Hebrew and differing social priorities.\n\nAn attempt to devise a more general system of romanization is complicated by the long and varied history of the Hebrew language. Most Hebrew texts can be appropriately pronounced according to several different systems of pronunciation, both traditional and modern. Even today, it is customary to write Hebrew using only consonants and matres lectionis. There was no way to indicate vowels clearly in Hebrew writing until the time of the Second Temple. Since an earlier time, multiple geographically separated communities have used Hebrew as a language of literature rather than conversation.\n\nOne system of assigning and indicating pronunciation in Hebrew, the Tiberian vocalization, is broadly authoritative for Hebrew text since the end of the Second Temple period (Sáenz-Badillos, page xi). It is possible to accommodate the pronunciations of different communities by transliterating the Tiberian vocalization without attempting to transcribe a specific phonetic pronunciation.\n\nNotable varieties of Hebrew for which Tiberian vocalization is not suitable are the Hebrew of the Qumran community (as known from the Dead Sea Scrolls) and of the Samaritans. For romanizations of Samaritan pronunciation, it is advisable to take quotations directly from a Samaritan edition of the Hebrew Bible, which has approximately 6,000 textual variations from Jewish editions.\n\nIt is appropriate to focus only on the consonantal spelling when discussing unusually structured words from ancient or medieval works.\n\nThe Tiberian vocalization was devised in order to add indications of pronunciation to the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, without changing the consonantal text. It was intended for experts in Biblical Hebrew grammar and morphology.\n\nTransliterations usually avoid the typographically complex marks that are used in Tiberian vocalization. They also attempt to indicate vowels and syllables more explicitly than Tiberian vocalization does. Therefore a technical transliteration requires the use of Tiberian principles, as mentioned below, rather than simply representing the Tiberian symbols. Many transliteration standards require a thorough knowledge of these principles, yet they usually do not provide practical details.\n\n\n\nA further complication is that the Roman alphabet does not have as many letters for certain sounds found in the Hebrew alphabet, and sometimes no letter at all. Some romanizations resolve this problem using additional non-Tiberian principles:\n\n\nFinally, for ease of reading it is common to apply certain principles foreign to Hebrew:\n\n\n\n"}

This rule has exceptions, but should generally be followed.\n\nSatellite cities are different from and are sometimes confused with the following related patterns of development.\n\nSatellite cities differ from suburbs in that they have distinct employment bases, commutersheds, and cultural offerings from the central metropolis, as well as an independent municipal government. Satellite cities are not bedroom communities.\n\nSatellite cities differ from edge cities, which are suburbs with large employment bases and cultural offerings, in that satellite cities must have a true historic downtown, a distinct independent municipal government, existed as a city prior to becoming interconnected with the larger metropolitan core, and are surrounded by \"both\" their own family of bedroom communities \"and\" a belt of rural land between themselves and the central city.\n\nConceptually, both satellite cities and some types of edge city could be (and once were) self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas, but have become interconnected due to the suburban expansion of the larger metropolis. However, while edge cities may have their own government and share many characteristics with satellite cities, they are much more physically integrated with the core city and would not exist in anything like their present form if not for the suburban expansion of their larger neighbor. Edge cities are activity nodes within a metro area, not miniature metro areas themselves.\n\nSome satellite cities that are particularly close or well connected to their larger neighbors and/or have their own historic downtown may also qualify as the \"uptown\" variety of edge cities, but the terms are not synonymous.\n\nIn some cases large metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance. These multi-polar cities are often referred to as twin cities. Multi-polar cities differ from satellite cities in such cases :\n\nFor example, Fort Worth, Texas is a twin of Dallas, Texas because though Fort Worth is somewhat smaller, it is proportionally close enough and physically integrated enough with Dallas to be considered a twin rather than a satellite. Generally speaking, cities that are listed as being part of the same urbanized area should be considered twins, rather than one having a satellite relationship to the other.\n\nConceptually, satellite cities are miniature metro areas on the fringe of larger ones.

Examples include stuttering or problems producing particular sounds. Articulation refers to the sounds, syllables, and phonology produced by the individual. Voice, however, may refer to the characteristics of the sounds produced—specifically, the pitch, quality, and intensity of the sound. Often, fluency will also be considered a category under speech, encompassing the characteristics of rhythm, rate, and emphasis of the sound produced \n\nA language impairment is a specific impairment in understanding and sharing thoughts and ideas, i.e. a disorder that involves the processing of linguistic information. Problems that may be experienced can involve the form of language, including grammar, morphology, syntax; and the functional aspects of language, including semantics and pragmatics\n\nAn individual can have one or both types of impairment. These impairments/disorders are identified by a speech and language pathologist.\n\nThe following are brief definitions of several of the more prominent speech disorders:\n\nApraxia of speech is the acquired form of motor speech disorder caused by brain injury, stroke or dementia.\n\nDevelopmental verbal dyspraxia refers specifically to a motor speech disorder. This is a neurological disorder. Individuals suffering from developmental verbal apraxia encounter difficulty saying sounds, syllables, and words. The difficulties are not due to weakness of muscles, but rather on coordination between the brain and the specific parts of the body. Apraxia of speech is the acquired form of this disorder caused by brain injury, stroke or dementia.\n\nInterventions are more effective when they occur individually at first, and between three and five times per week. With improvements, children with apraxia may be transitioned into group therapy settings. Therapeutic exercises must focus on planning, sequencing, and coordinating the muscle movements involved in speech production. Children with developmental verbal dyspraxia must practice the strategies and techniques that they learn in order to improve. In addition to practice, feedback can be helpful to improve apraxia of speech. Tactile feedback (touch), visual feedback (watching self in mirror), and verbal feedback are all important additions. Biofeedback has also been cited as a possible therapy. Functional training involves placing the individual in more speech situations, while providing him/her with a speech model, such as the SLP. Because the cause is neurological, however, some patients do not progress.\nIn these cases, AAC may be more appropriate.\n\nDysarthria is a motor speech disorder that results from a neurological injury. Some stem from central damage, while other stem from peripheral nerve damage. Difficulties may be encountered in respiratory problems, vocal fold function, or velopharyngeal closure, for example.\n\nOrofacial myofunctional disorders refers to problems encountered when the tongue thrusts forward inappropriately during speech. While this is typical in infants, most children outgrow this. Children that continue to exaggerate the tongue movement may incorrectly produce speech sounds, such as /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/, and /dʒ/. For example, the word, \"some,\" might be pronounced as \"thumb\".\n\nThe treatment of OMD will be based upon the professional's evaluation. Each child will present a unique oral posture that must be corrected. Thus, the individual interventions will vary. Some examples include:\n\nSpeech sound disorders may be of two varieties: articulation (the production of sounds) or phonological processes (sound patterns). An articulation disorder may take the form of substitution, omission, addition, or distortion of normal speech sounds. Phonological process disorders may involve more systematic difficulties with the production of particular types of sounds, such as those made in the back of the mouth, like \"k\" and \"g\".\n\nNaturally, abnormalities in speech mechanisms would need to be ruled out by a medical professional. Therapies for articulation problems must be individualized to fit the individual case. The placement approach—instructing the individual on the location in which the tongue should be and how to blow air correctly—could be helpful in difficulties with certain speech sounds. Another individual might benefit more from developing auditory discrimination skills, since he/she has not learned to identify error sounds in his/her speech. Generalization of these learned speech techniques will need to be generalized to everyday situations. Phonological process treatment, on the other hand, can involve making syntactical errors, such as omissions in words. In cases such as these, explicit teaching of the linguistic rules may be sufficient.\n\nSome cases of speech sound disorders, for example, may involve difficulties articulating speech sounds. Educating a child on the appropriate ways to produce a speech sound and encouraging the child to practice this articulation over time may produce natural speech, Speech sound disorder. Likewise, stuttering does not have a single, known cause, but has been shown to be effectively reduced or eliminated by fluency shaping (based on behavioral principles) and stuttering modification techniques.\n\nStuttering is a disruption in the fluency of an individual's speech, which begins in childhood and may persist over a lifetime. Stuttering is a form of disfluency; disfluency becomes a problem insofar as it impedes successful communication between two parties. Disfluencies may be due to unwanted repetitions of sounds, or extension of speech sounds, syllables, or words. Disfluencies also incorporate unintentional pauses in speech, in which the individual is unable to produce speech sounds.\n\nWhile the effectiveness is debated, most treatment programs for stuttering are behavioral. In such cases, the individual learns skills that improve oral communication abilities, such as controlling and monitoring the rate of speech. SLPs may also help these individuals to speak more slowly and to manage the physical tension involved in the communication process. Fluency may be developed by selecting a slow rate of speech, and making use of short phrases and sentences. With success, the speed may be increased until a natural rate of smooth speech is achieved. Additionally, punishment for incorrect speech production should be eliminated, and a permissive speaking environment encouraged. Electronic fluency devices, which alter the auditory input and provide modified auditory feedback to the individual, have shown mixed results in research reviews.\n\nBecause stuttering is such a common phenomenon, and because it is not entirely understood, various opposing schools of thought emerge to describe its etiology. The Breakdown theories maintain that stuttering is the result of a weakening or breakdown in physical systems that are necessary for smooth speech production. Cerebral dominance theories (in the stutterer, no cerebral hemisphere takes the neurological lead) and theories of perseveration (neurological \"skipping record\" of sorts) are both Breakdown theories. Auditory Monitoring theories suggest that stutters hear themselves differently from how other people hear them. Since speakers adjust their communication based upon the auditory feedback they hear (their own speech), this creates conflict between the input and the output process. Psychoneurotic theories posit repressed needs as the source of stuttering. Lastly, Learning theories are straightforward—children learn to stutter. It should be clear that each etiological position would suggest a different intervention, leading to controversy with the field.\n\nVoice disorders range from aphonia (loss of phonation) to dysphonia, which may be phonatory and/or resonance disorders. Phonatory characteristics could include breathiness, hoarseness, harshness, intermittency, pitch, etc. Resonance characteristics refer to overuse or underuse of the resonance chambers resulting in hypernasality or hyponasality. Several examples of voice problems are vocal cord nodules or polyps, vocal cord paralysis, paradoxical vocal fold movement, and spasmodic dysphonia. Vocal cord nodules and polyps are different phenomena, but both may be caused by vocal abuse, and both may take the form of growths, bumps, or swelling on the vocal cords. Vocal fold paralysis is the inability to move one or both of the vocal cords, which results in difficulties with voice and perhaps swallowing. Paradoxical vocal fold movement occurs when the vocal cords close when they should actually be open. Spasmodic dysphonia is caused by strained vocal cord movement, which results in awkward voice problems, such as jerkiness or quavering.\n\nIf nodules or polyps are present, and are large, surgery may be the appropriate choice for removal. Surgery is not recommended for children, however. Other medical treatment may suffice for slighter problems, such as those induced by gastroesophageal reflux disease, allergies, or thyroid problems. Outside of medical and surgical interventions, professional behavioral interventions can be useful in teaching good vocal habits and minimizing abuse of vocal cords. This voice therapy may instruct in attention to pitch, loudness, and breathing exercises. Additionally, the individual may be instructed on the optimal position to produce the maximum vocal quality. Bilateral paralysis is another disorder that may require medical or surgical interventions to return vocal cords to normalcy; unilateral paralysis may be treated medically or behaviorally.\n\nParadoxical vocal fold movement (PVFM) is also treated medically and behaviorally. Behavioral interventions will focus on voice exercises, relaxation strategies, and techniques that can be used to support breath. More generally, however, PVFM interventions focus on helping an individual to understand what triggers the episode, and how to deal with it when it does occur.\n\nWhile there is no cure for spasmodic dysphonia, medical and psychological interventions can alleviate some of the symptoms. Medical interventions involve repeated injections of Botox into one or both of the vocal cords. This weakens the laryngeal muscles, and results in a smoother voice.\n\nA language disorder is an impairment in the ability to understand and/or use words in context, both verbally and nonverbally. Some characteristics of language disorders include improper use of words and their meanings, inability to express ideas, inappropriate grammatical patterns, reduced vocabulary and inability to follow directions. One or a combination of these characteristics may occur in children who are affected by language learning disabilities or developmental language delay. Children may hear or see a word but not be able to understand its meaning. They may have trouble getting others to understand what they are trying to communicate.\n\nInterventions for specific language impairment will be based upon the individual difficulties in which the impairment manifests. For example, if the child is incapable of separating individual morphemes, or units of sound, in speech, then the interventions may take the form of rhyming, or of tapping on each syllable. If comprehension is the trouble, the intervention may focus on developing metacognitive strategies to evaluate his/her knowledge while reading, and after reading is complete. It is important that whatever intervention is employed, it must be generalized to the general education classroom.\n\nSelective mutism is a disorder that manifests as a child that does not speak in at least one social setting, despite being able to speak in other situations. Selective mutism is normally discovered when the child first starts school.\n\nBehavioral treatment plans can be effective in bringing about the desired communication across settings. Stimulus fading involves a gradual desensitization, in which the individual is placed in a comfortable situation and the environment is gradually modified to increase the stress levels without creating a large change in stress level. Shaping relies on behavioral modification techniques, in which successive attempts to produce speech is reinforced. Self-modeling techniques may also be helpful; for example, self-modeling video tapes, in which the child watches a video of him/herself performing the desired action, can be useful.\n\nIf additional confounding speech problems exist, a SLP may work with the student to identify what factors are complicating speech production and what factors might be increasing the mute behaviors. Additionally, he/she might work with the individual to become more comfortable with social situations, and with the qualities of their own voice. If voice training is required, they might offer this as well.\n\nAphasia refers to a family of language disorders that usually stem from injury, lesion, or atrophy to the left side of the brain that result in reception, perception, and recall of language; in addition, language formation and expressive capacities may be inhibited.\n\nLanguage-based learning disabilities, which refer to difficulties with reading, spelling, and/or writing that are evidenced in a significant lag behind the individual's same-age peers. Most children with these disabilities are at least of average intelligence, ruling out intellectual impairments as the causal factor.\n\nThe DSM-5 and the ICD-10 are both used to make specific diagnostic decisions.\nSpeech and language disorders commonly include communication issues, but also extend into various areas such as oral-motor function—sucking, swallowing, drinking, or eating. In some cases, a child's communication is delayed considerably behind his/her same-aged peers. The effects of these disorders can range from basic difficulties in the production of certain letter sounds to more comprehensive inabilities to generate (expressive) or understand (receptive) language. In most cases, the causal factors that create these speech and language difficulties are unknown. There are a wide variety of biological and environmental causal factors that can create them, ranging from drug abuse to neurological issues. For more information on causal hypotheses, refer to the section on models.\n\nDevelopmental disorders tend to have a genetic origin, such as mutations of FOXP2, which has been linked to developmental verbal dyspraxia and specific language impairment. Some of these impairments are caused by genetics. Case histories often reveal a positive family history of communication disorders. Between 28% and 60% of children with a speech and language deficit have a sibling and/or parent who is also affected. Down syndrome is another example of a genetic causal factor that may result in speech and/or language impairments. Stuttering is a disorder that is hypothesized to have a strong genetic component as well.\n\nSome speech and language impairments have environmental causes. A specific language impairment, for example, may be caused by insufficient language stimulation in the environment. If a child does not have access to an adequate role model, or is not spoken to with much frequency, the child may not develop strong language skills. Furthermore, if a child has little stimulating experiences, or is not encouraged to develop speech, that child may have little incentive to speak at all and may not develop speech and language skills at an average pace.\n\nDevelopmental disabilities such as autism and neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy may also result in impaired communicative abilities. Similarly, malformation or malfunctioning of the respiratory system or speech mechanisms may result in speech impairments. For example, a cleft palate will allow too much air to pass through the nasal cavity and a cleft lip will not allow the individual to correctly form sounds that require the upper lip. The development of vocal fold nodules represents another issue of biological causation. In some cases of biological origin, medical interventions such as surgery or medication may be required. Other cases may require speech therapy or behavioral training.\n\nAcquired disorders result from brain injury, stroke or atrophy, many of these issues are included under the Aphasia umbrella.\nBrain damage, for example, may result in various forms of aphasia if critical areas of the brain such as Broca's or Wernicke's area are damaged by lesions or atrophy as part of a dementia.\n\nWhat follows are a list of frequently used measures of speech and language skills, and the age-ranges for which they are appropriate.\n\nUnder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 2004, the federal government has defined a speech or language impairment as \"a communication disorder such as stuttering, impaired articulation, a language impairment, or a voice impairment, which adversely affects a child's learning\". In order to qualify in the educational system as having a speech or language impairment, the child's speech must be either unintelligible much of the time or he/she must have been professionally diagnosed as having either a speech impairment or language delay which requires intervention. Additionally, IDEA 2004 contains an exclusionary clause that stipulates that a speech or language impairment may not be either cultural, ethnic, bilingual, or dialectical differences in language, temporary disorders (such as those induced by dental problems), or delayed abilities in producing the most difficult linguistic sounds in a child's age range.\n\nSpeech-language pathologists (SLPs) offer many services to children with speech or language disabilities.\n\nSpeech-language pathologists (SLPs) may provide individual therapy for the child to assist with speech production problems such as stuttering. They may consult with the child's teacher about ways in which the child might be accommodated in the classroom, or modifications that might be made in instruction or environment. The SLP can also make crucial connections with the family, and help them to establish goals and techniques to be used in the home. Other service providers, such as counselors or vocational instructors may also be included in the development of goals as the child transitions into adulthood.\n\nThe individual services that the child receives will depend upon the needs of that child. Simpler problems of speech, such as hoarseness or vocal fatigue (voicing problems) may be solved with basic instruction on how to modulate one's voice. Articulation problems could be remediated by simple practice in sound pronunciation. Fluency problems may be remediated with coaching and practice under the guidance of trained professionals, and may disappear with age. However, more complicated problems, such as those accompanying autism or strokes, may require many years of one-on-one therapy with a variety of service providers. In most cases, it is imperative that the families be included in the treatment plans since they can help to implement the treatment plans. The educators are also a critical link in the implementation of the child's treatment plan.\n\nFor children with language disorders, professionals often relate the treatment plans to classroom content, such as classroom textbooks or presentation assignments. The professional teaches various strategies to the child, and the child works to apply them effectively in the classroom. For success in the educational environment, it is imperative that the SLP or other speech-language professional have a strong, positive rapport with the teacher(s).\n\nSpeech-language pathologists create plans that cater to the individual needs of the patient. If speech is not practical for a patient, the SLP will work with the patient to decide upon an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) method or device to facilitate communication. They may work with other patients to help them make sounds, improve voices, or teach general communication strategies. They also work with individuals who have difficulties swallowing. In addition to offering these types of communication training services, SLPs also keep records of evaluation, progress, and eventual discharge of patients, and work with families to overcome and cope with communication impairments (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009).\n\nIn many cases, SLPs provide direct clinical services to individuals with communication or swallowing disorders. SLPs work with physicians, psychologists, and social workers to provide services in the medical domain, and collaborate with educational professionals to offer additional services for students to facilitate the educational process. Thus, speech-language services may be found in schools, hospitals, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes, among other settings.\n\nThe setting in which therapy is provided to the individual depends upon the age, type, and severity of the individual's impairment. An infant/toddler may engage in an early intervention program, in which services are delivered in a naturalistic environment in which the child is most comfortable—probably his/her home. If the child is school-aged, he/she may receive speech-language services at an outpatient clinic, or even at his/her home school as part of a weekly program. The type of setting in which therapy is offered depends largely upon characteristics of the individual and his/her disability.\n\nAs with any professional practice that is informed by ongoing research, controversies exist in the fields that deal with speech and language disorders. One such current debate relates to the efficacy of oral motor exercises and the expectations surrounding them. According to Lof, non-speech oral motor exercises (NS-OME) includes \"any technique that does not require the child to produce a speech sound but is used to influence the development of speaking abilities\". These sorts of exercises would include blowing, tongue push-ups, pucker-smile, tongue wags, big smile, tongue-to-nose-to-chin, cheek puffing, blowing kisses, and tongue curling, among others. Lof continues, indicating that 85% of SLPs are currently using NS-OME. Additionally, these exercises are used for dysarthria, apraxia, late talkers, structural anomalies, phonological impairments, hearing impairments, and other disorders. Practitioners assume that these exercises will strengthen articulatory structures and generalize to speech acts. Lof reviews 10 studies, and concludes that only one of the studies shows benefits to these exercises (it also suffered serious methodological flaws). Lof ultimately concludes that the exercises employ the same structures, but are used for different functions. The NS-OME position is not without its supporters, however, and the proponents are numerous.\n\nIntervention services will be guided by the strengths and needs determined by the speech and language evaluation. The areas of need may be addressed individually until each one is functional; alternatively, multiple needs may be addressed simultaneously through the intervention techniques. If possible, all interventions will be geared towards the goal of developing typical communicative interaction. To this end, interventions typically follow either a preventive, remedial, or compensatory model. The preventive service model is common as an early intervention technique, especially for children whose other disorders place them at a higher risk for developing later communication problems. This model works to lessen the probability or severity of the issues that could later emerge. The remedial model is used when an individual already has a speech or language impairment that he/she wishes to have corrected. Compensatory models would be used if a professional determines that it is best for the child to bypass the communication limitation; often, this relies on AAC.\n\nLanguage intervention activities are used in some therapy sessions. In these exercises, an SLP or other trained professional will interact with a child by working with the child through play and other forms of interaction to talk to the child and model language use. The professional will make use of various stimuli, such as books, objects, or simple pictures to stimulate the emerging language. In these activities, the professional will model correct pronunciation, and will encourage the child to practice these skills. Articulation therapy may be used during play therapy as well, but involves modeling specific aspects of language—the production of sound. The specific sounds will be modeled for the child by the professional (often the SLP), and the specific processes involved in creating those sounds will be taught as well. For example, the professional might instruct the child in the placement of the tongue or lips in order to produce certain consonant sounds.\n\nTechnology is another avenue of intervention, and can help children whose physical conditions make communication difficult. The use of electronic communication systems allow nonspeaking people and people with severe physical disabilities to engage in the give and take of shared thought.\n\nWhile some speech problems, such as certain voice problems, require medical interventions, many speech problems can be alleviated through effective behavioral interventions and practice. In these cases, instruction in speech techniques or speaking strategies, coupled with regular practice, can help the individual to overcome his/her speaking difficulties. In other, more severe cases, the individual with speech problems may compensate with AAC devices.\n\nSpeech impairments can seriously limit the manner in which an individual interacts with others in work, school, social, and even home environments. Inability to correctly form speech sounds might create stress, embarrassment, and frustration in both the speaker and the listener. Over time, this could create aggressive responses on the part of the listener for being misunderstood, or out of embarrassment. Alternatively, it could generate an avoidance of social situations that create these stressful situations. Language impairments create similar difficulties in communicating with others, but may also include difficulties in understanding what others are trying to say (receptive language). Because of the pervasive nature of language impairments, communicating, reading, writing, and academic success may all be compromised in these students. Similar to individuals with speech impairments, individuals with language impairments may encounter long-term difficulties associated with work, school, social, and home environments.\n\nAugmentative and alternative communication (AAC) includes all forms of communication other than oral communication that an individual might employ to make known his/her thoughts. AAC work to compensate for impairments that an individual might have with expressive language abilities. Each system works to maintain a natural and functional level of communication. There is no one best type of AAC for all individuals; rather, the best type of AAC will be determined by the strengths and weaknesses of a specific individual. While there are a large number of types of AAC, there are fundamentally two categories: aided and unaided.\n\nUnaided systems of communication are those that require both communication parties to be physically present in the same location. Examples of unaided systems include gestures, body language, sign language, and communication boards. Communication boards are devices upon which letters, words, or pictorial symbols might be displayed; the individual may interface with the communication board to express him/herself to the other individual.\n\nAided systems of communication do not require both individuals to be physically present in the same location, though they might be. Aided systems are often electronic devices, and they may or may not provide some form of voice output. If a device does create a voice output, it is referred to as a speech generating device. While the message may take the form of speech output, it may also be printed as a visual display of speech. Many of these devices can be connected to a computer, and in some cases, they may even be adapted to produce a variety of different languages.\n\nStudents identified with a speech and language disability often qualify for an Individualized Education Plan as well as particular services. These include one-on-one services with a speech and language pathologist. Examples used in a session include reading vocabulary words, identifying particular vowel sounds and then changing the context, noting the difference. School districts in the United States often have speech and language pathologists within a special education staff to work with students. Additionally, school districts can place students with speech and language disabilities in a resource room for individualized instruction. A combination of early intervention and individualized support has shown promise increasing long-term academic achievement with students with this disability.\n\nStudents might work individually with a specialist, or with a specialist in a group setting. In some cases, the services provided to these individuals may even be provided in the regular education classroom. Regardless of where these services are provided, most of these students spend small amounts of time in therapy and the large majority of their time in the regular education classroom with their typically developing peers.\n\nTherapy often occurs in small groups of three or four students with similar needs. Meeting either in the office of the speech-language pathologist or in the classroom, sessions may take from 30 minutes to one hour. They may occur several times per week. After introductory conversations, the session is focused on a particular therapeutic activity, such as coordination and strengthening exercises of speech muscles or improving fluency through breathing techniques. These activities may take the form of games, songs, skits, and other activities that deliver the needed therapy. Aids, such as mirrors, tape recorders, and tongue depressors may be utilized to help the children to become aware of their speech sounds and to work toward more natural speech production.\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Department of Education indicated that more than 1.4 million students were served in the public schools' special education programs under the speech or language impairment category of IDEA 2004. This estimate does not include children who have speech/language problems secondary to other conditions such as deafness; this means that if all cases of speech or language impairments were included in the estimates, this category of impairment would be the largest. Another source has estimated that communication disorders—a larger category, which also includes hearing disorders—affect one of every 10 people in the United States.\n\nASHA has cited that 24.1% of children in school in the fall of 2003 received services for speech or language disorders—this amounts to a total of 1,460,583 children between 3 –21 years of age. Again, this estimate does not include children who have speech/language problems secondary to other conditions. Additional ASHA prevalence figures have suggested the following:\n\nWhile more common in childhood, speech impairments can result in a child being bullied. Bullying is a harmful activity that often takes place at school, though may be present in adult life. Bullying involves the consistent and intentional harassment of another individual, and may be physical or verbal in nature.\n\nSpeech impairments (e.g., stuttering) and language impairments (e.g., dyslexia, auditory processing disorder) may also result in discrimination in the workplace. For example, an employer would be discriminatory if he/she chose to not make reasonable accommodations for the affected individual, such as allowing the individual to miss work for medical appointments or not making onsite-accommodations needed because of the speech impairment. In addition to making such appropriate accommodations, the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) protects against discrimination in \"job application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment\".\n\nSmith offers the following definitions of major terms that are important in the world of speech and language disorders.\n\n\nIn the mid 19th century, the scientific endeavors of such individuals as Charles Darwin gave rise to more systematic and scientific consideration of physical phenomenon, and the work of others, such as Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke, also lent scientific rigor to the study of speech and language disorders. The late 19th century saw an increase in \"pre-professionals,\" those who offered speech and language services based upon personal experiences or insights. Several trends were exhibited even in the 19th century, some have indicated the importance of elocution training in the early 19th century, through which individuals would seek out those with training to improve their vocal qualities. By 1925 in the USA interest in these trends lead to the forming of the organization that would become American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and the birth of speech-language pathology.\n\nThe twentieth century has been proposed to be composed of four major periods: Formative Years, Processing Period, Linguistic Era, and Pragmatics Revolution. The Formative Years, which began around 1900 and ended around WWII, was a time during which the scientific rigor extended and professionalism entered the picture. During this period, the first school-based program began in the U.S. (1910). The Processing Period, from roughly 1945-1965, further developed the assessment and interventions available for general communication disorders; much of these focused on the internal, psychological transactions involved in the communication process. During the Linguistic Era, from about 1965-1975, professionals began to separate language deficits from speech deficits, which had major implications for diagnosis and treatment of these communication disorders. Lastly, the Pragmatics Revolution has continued to shape the professional practice by considering major ecological factors, such as culture, in relation to speech and language impairments. It was during this period that IDEA was passed, and this allowed professionals to begin working with a greater scope and to increase the diversity of problems with which they concerned themselves.\n\n\n"}

Though the script is sometimes erroneously claimed to be named after its inventor, as in Carl Faulmann's \"Das Buch der Schrift\", the alphabet's name is derived from Vithkuq, a village in the Korçë region where Veqilharxhi was born. Vithkuqi script was specifically designed to be as religiously neutral as possible, avoiding the duplication of Greek, Latin, or Arabic characters. It had a near-perfect correspondence between letters and phonemes, but lacked characters for modern Albanian \"gj\", \"rr\", \"xh\", and \"zh\". The script never took hold because of its inventor's premature death and because of the prohibitive costs of cutting new type for the invented characters; nevertheless, a number of documents using the script were published in the late 19th century. The script was eventually overwhelmed by the Greek, Arabic and Latin scripts it had been designed to supplant, the latter becoming the official one in 1909.\n\nOther original scripts used for Albanian were the Elbasan script and the Todhri script of the 18th century. These scripts similarly failed to see prolonged widespread usage.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "28929109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28929109", "title": "Wiki-constitutionalism", "text": "Wiki-constitutionalism\n\nWiki-constitutionalism is a neologism coined by political analyst Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez in a 2010 article for \"The New Republic\". The term describes the phenomenon in which national governments, particularly in Latin America, rewrite their constitutions completely every few years, a habit which Lansberg-Rodriguez argues usually leads to overly strengthened executives as other branches of government will lack \"the institutional legitimacy, memory, relationships, and mandate necessary to govern independently.\" The term itself is an amalgam of constitution and the \"ever-morphing articles on the open-source database Wikipedia.\" Lansberg-Rodriguez' article was later recommended for reading by \"The New York Times\".\n\nThe principal evidence cited for the existence of \"Wiki-constitutionalism\" is the sheer number of constitutions which have existed in Latin America when compared with other regions of the globe. If one looks at fully restructured rewrites (as opposed to amendments), \"the Dominican Republic has had 32 separate constitutions since its independence in 1821. Venezuela follows close behind with 26, Haiti has had 24, Ecuador 20, and Bolivia recently passed its seventeenth\" and \"over half of the 21 Latin American nations have had at least ten constitutions while, in the rest of the world, only Thailand (17), France (16), Greece (13), and Poland (10) have reached double digits.\"\n\nThe original piece is highly critical of leaders such as Hugo Chávez, Rafael Correa and Evo Morales who have allegedly helped prolong a self-perpetuating cycle of constitutional attrition by pushing new constitutions packaged with \"ever-longer lists of promises and rights alongside greater executive functions\", resulting in constitutions which are \"not only the shortest-lived, but also among the longest in the world.\" Bolivia's and Ecuador's constitutions have 411 and 444 articles, respectively, and \"read like laundry lists of guaranteed rights, such as access to mail and telephones; guarantees for culture, identity, and dignity; and shorter work-weeks.\"\n\nAfter an unauthorized and inaccurate Spanish translation of the article began circulating in May 2010, controversy erupted in the Dominican press over Wiki-constitutionalism and whether the mention of Dominican President Leonel Fernández alongside Hugo Chávez, Rafael Correa, Evo Morales and Colombian president Álvaro Uribe as \"attempting to tear up and revise their constitutionally mandated term limits\" was tantamount to an accusation of his being a dictator. Ramon Morel Cerda, the former head of the Supreme Electoral Council for the Dominican Republic discussed the controversy on June 7, 2010, in an opinion piece for the \"Hoy\" Newspaper.\n"}
