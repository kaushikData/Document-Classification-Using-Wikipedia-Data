{"id": "15696652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15696652", "title": "Catalogue aria", "text": "Catalogue aria\n\nA catalogue aria is a genre of opera aria in which the singer recounts a list of information (people, places, food, dance steps, etc.) that was popular in Italian comic opera in the latter half of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. \"Madamina, il catalogo è questo\" from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" is the most famous example, and is often referred to as \"the catalogue aria\". Leporello notes how many lovers the title character has had in each country he has visited. Pasquale sings two such arias in Joseph Haydn's \"Orlando paladino\", \"Ho viaggiato in Francia, in Spagna\" in act one, which lists the countries to which he has traveled, and \"Ecco spiano\" in act 2, which rattles off all of his varied musical talents.\n\nThe traditional devices of the catalogue aria include a solidly neutral opening, a section of rising comic excitement full of rapid patter and an emphatic final cadence, normally closing with an epigram. Common features include asyndeton, anaphora, rhyme schemes, and complete phrases stacked two to a line, typically expressed with joy, anger, excitement or fear, routinely fast declamation of patter in a generally mechanical and often impersonal way.\n\nThe clearest antecedent of the catalogue aria of Mozart and librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte can be found in the 1787 opera, \"Don Giovanni Tenorio\", with which they were both familiar, composed by Giuseppe Gazzaniga on a libretto by Giovanni Bertati. Da Ponte based much of his libretto on Bertati's, heavily revised for content and language but significantly retaining much of the narrative structure. In this opera, one finds a similar catalogue aria for the equivalent character of Leporello, Pasquariello. John Platoff sees superiority in Da Ponte's text as well as Mozart's music. The Bertati aria, \"Dell' Italia ed Alemagna\" uses punch lines such as \"ve ne sono non se quante (there I know not how many)\" while Da Ponte uses specific numerical figures to add to the humor (e.g. \"ma in Espagna, son già mille e tre, mille e tre, mille e tre (But in Spain he had one thousand and three, one thousand and three, one thousand and three)\". Bertati also structures the aria differently, beginning immediately with the list and not including an introduction, which is in the preceding recitative. Da Ponte removed ugly words and references to women of lower social station (\"cuoche,\" \"guattere\"), and took a reference that being female is enough to be of interest to Giovanni (although Bertati's Giovanni, unlike Da Ponte's, is not interested in old ladies), to a more subtle conclusion shifted to the closing that it Giovanni wants anyone who wears a skirt. Platoff considers Mozart's approach to the music \"genius\" in that Mozart finishes the patter in the first part of the aria before going on to the second. His unconventional approach divides the aria \"based on content rather than metre.\" By dividing the aria at line 14, Mozart separates the numbers of women from the kinds of women, \"contrary to the natural tendency to put the energetic high point at the end of the comic aria,\" although Platoff also notes that Giovanni Paisiello does this in \"Scorsi già molti paesi,\" a buffa aria from \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" (libretto by Giuseppe Petrosellini) to which Platoff compares catalogue arias in general. The minuet for of the andante section allows Leporello to imitate his master. This, Platoff argues, \"draws comedy from human foible rather than mechanized display of patter declamation\", suggesting that Leporello is telling us as much about himself as he is about Giovanni. Leporello's aria contains no epigram—the Andante section takes its place.\n\nC. Headington, R. Westbroook, and T. Barfoot in \"Opera: A History\" (1987) say that \"Ho viaggiato in Francia, in Spagna\" \"must surely be ranked as the forerunner of Leporello's... aria\", but they seem to have gone to the next most familiar piece of music rather than digging into research. Platoff notes that catalogue arias were a particular specialty of Bertati.\n\n\"(in chronological order)\"\n\n\n"}

CAL’s mission is to promote language learning and cultural understanding by serving as a trusted source for research, resources, and policy analysis. Through its work, CAL seeks solutions to issues involving language and culture as they relate to access and equity in education and society around the world. CAL’s President and Chief Executive Officer is Joel Gómez.\n\nThe organization carries out its mission by working in the fields of bilingual and dual language education, English as a second language, world languages education, language policy, assessment, immigrant and refugee integration, literacy dialect studies; and the education of linguistically and culturally diverse adults and children (Peterson, 2004). Staff members conduct research, design and develop language assessments and instructional materials, provide technical assistance and professional development, and disseminate information and resources related to language and culture.\n\nAt the close of the 1950s, issues of language diversity, interest in language policy, and the emergence of English as a world language created a demand for information about world languages and for expertise in linguistics and language training. In the United States, reactions to the launch of Sputnik and the continuation of the Cold War led to concern about the ability of U.S. schools to train students in mathematics, the sciences, and foreign languages. CAL was created in this environment of increased interest in language issues by Dr. Charles A. Ferguson, a pioneer in the field of applied linguistics. Through a grant from the Ford Foundation to the Modern Language Association, CAL was established in 1959 to serve as a liaison between the academic world of linguistics, and the practical world of language education and language-related concerns (Spolsky, 1999; Troike, 2008). CAL's original mandate was to improve the teaching of English around the world; encourage the teaching and learning of less commonly taught languages; contribute new knowledge to the field by conducting language research to resolve social and educational problems; and serve as a clearinghouse for information collection, analysis, and dissemination and as a coordinating agency to bring together scholars and practitioners involved in language-related issues.\n\nSince its inception, CAL has played a leading role in conducting research on language use, language learning, and effective teaching methods, and translating research into practical applications to help language learners succeed (Christian, 2008; Berns, 2010). Among the populations that CAL serves are language educators of children and adults who are learning foreign languages and English as a second language; immigrants and refugees in the United States and the agencies that provide services for them; schools, school districts, and other educational institutions in need of curriculum development, professional development, and assessments; and policy makers who need information about language and culture to address the important issues of the day.\n\nCAL's website provides detailed information about the organization and access to resources on a wide range of topics including\n\nEnglish Learners: CAL works with educators and practitioners to help the growing number of students who speak English as a second language in the United States succeed in the classroom and the workplace.\n\nWorld Languages Education: Proficiency in languages other than English is critical in the global society. CAL provides resources to inform language education at all levels of instruction, from early language programs in elementary schools through graduate level programs for individuals seeking high levels of proficiency in a range of languages.\n\nSheltered Instruction: CAL supports educators who are implementing sheltered instruction, an approach to teaching that promotes language development and content-area learning for students who are not yet proficient in the language of instruction.\n\nBilingual and Dual Language Education: Proficiency in more than one language is a valuable skill to be cultivated and nurtured in schools and communities. CAL provides information and resources to support the development of bilingualism and the academic success of English language learners through programs that utilize their native language in instruction.\nHeritage and Community Languages: The United States has a rich diversity of languages other than English that are spoken in communities around the country. CAL offers a rich set of resources about heritage and community languages.\n\nImmigrant and Refugee Integration: Since the major influx of refugees from Southeast Asia in the 1970s, CAL has conducted programs in refugee integration and orientation, helping newcomers understand fundamental aspects of life in the United States while helping service providers and interested parties understand the rich cultures and likely resettlement needs of the new members of their communities.\n\nTesting and Assessment: CAL researches and develops assessments of language proficiency in English as a second language and foreign languages at all educational and proficiency levels. Specialists also examine the language and culture issues related to assessment of subject matter knowledge through a second language for English learners and design innovative approaches to addressing these concerns. CAL has been involved in the development of many tests, including the TOEFL. The TOEFL was originally developed at the Center for Applied Linguistics under the direction of Stanford University applied linguistics professor and CAL's first president Dr. Charles A. Ferguson.\n\nLanguage Planning and Policy: CAL facilitates collaboration nationally and internationally among scholars and other stakeholders and is committed to making significant contributions to the dialogue and debate about language planning and policy with the goal of expanding language choices and widening the context within which language policy decisions are made. In particular, CAL is focusing on language in education planning as a means of promoting language acquisition and achieving greater equity of access to resources.\n\nResearch: CAL is involved in a variety of research projects that inform its mission, such as math, science, and language education for English learners, biliteracy development for Spanish-speaking students, effective approaches for developing high levels of language proficiency in English and other languages, and innovative methods for assessing math and science knowledge in English learners. Much of CAL’s grant and project work includes a substantial research component.\n\nServices: CAL offers solutions to the challenges faced by practitioners working with language learners at all levels of instruction through professional development, technical assistance, program evaluation, and other services.\n\nResources: CAL provides research-based language and cultural education resources and testing tools, including publications, teacher tools, free downloadable digests, and databases and directories of information about language programs.\n\nOn its website, CAL provides information about current projects. The organization also distributes a monthly email newsletter, \"CALNews\", and an annual report.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8035060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8035060", "title": "Ecosystem model", "text": "Ecosystem model\n\nAn ecosystem model is an abstract, usually mathematical, representation of an ecological system (ranging in scale from an individual population, to an ecological community, or even an entire biome), which is studied to better understand the real system.\n\nUsing data gathered from the field, ecological relationships—such as the relation of sunlight and water availability to photosynthetic rate, or that between predator and prey populations—are derived, and these are combined to form ecosystem models. These model systems are then studied in order to make predictions about the dynamics of the real system. Often, the study of inaccuracies in the model (when compared to empirical observations) will lead to the generation of hypotheses about possible ecological relations that are not yet known or well understood. Models enable researchers to simulate large-scale experiments that would be too costly or unethical to perform on a real ecosystem. They also enable the simulation of ecological processes over very long periods of time (i.e. simulating a process that takes centuries in reality, can be done in a matter of minutes in a computer model).\n\nEcosystem models have applications in a wide variety of disciplines, such as natural resource management, ecotoxicology and environmental health, agriculture, and wildlife conservation. Ecological modelling has even been applied to archaeology with varying degrees of success, for example, combining with archaeological models to explain the diversity and mobility of stone tools.\n\nThere are two major types of ecological models, which are generally applied to different types of problems: (1) \"analytic\" models and (2) \"simulation\" / \"computational\" models. Analytic models are typically relatively simple (often linear) systems, that can be accurately described by a set of mathematical equations whose behavior is well-known. Simulation models on the other hand, use numerical techniques to solve problems for which analytic solutions are impractical or impossible. Simulation models tend to be more widely used, and are generally considered more ecologically realistic, while analytic models are valued for their mathematical elegance and explanatory power. Ecopath is a powerful software system which uses simulation and computational methods to model marine ecosystems. It is widely used by marine and fisheries scientists as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.\n\nThe process of model design begins with a specification of the problem to be solved, and the objectives for the model.\n\nEcological systems are composed of an enormous number of biotic and abiotic factors that interact with each other in ways that are often unpredictable, or so complex as to be impossible to incorporate into a computable model. Because of this complexity, ecosystem models typically simplify the systems they are studying to a limited number of components that are well understood, and deemed relevant to the problem that the model is intended to solve.\n\nThe process of simplification typically reduces an ecosystem to a small number of state variables and mathematical functions that describe the nature of the relationships between them. The number of ecosystem components that are incorporated into the model is limited by aggregating similar processes and entities into functional groups that are treated as a unit.\n\nAfter establishing the components to be modeled and the relationships between them, another important factor in ecosystem model structure is the representation of space used. Historically, models have often ignored the confounding issue of space. However, for many ecological problems spatial dynamics are an important part of the problem, with different spatial environments leading to very different outcomes. \"Spatially explicit models\" (also called \"spatially distributed\" or \"landscape\" models) attempt to incorporate a heterogeneous spatial environment into the model. A spatial model is one that has one or more state variables that are a function of space, or can be related to other spatial variables.\n\nAfter construction, models are \"validated\" to ensure that the results are acceptably accurate or realistic. One method is to test the model with multiple sets of data that are independent of the actual system being studied. This is important since certain inputs can cause a faulty model to output correct results. Another method of validation is to compare the model's output with data collected from field observations. Researchers frequently specify beforehand how much of a disparity they are willing to accept between parameters output by a model and those computed from field data.\n\nOne of the earliest, and most well-known, ecological models is the predator-prey model of Alfred J. Lotka (1925) and Vito Volterra (1926). This model takes the form of a pair of ordinary differential equations, one representing a prey species, the other its predator.\n\nwhere,\n\nVolterra originally devised the model to explain fluctuations in fish and shark populations observed in the Adriatic Sea after the First World War (when fishing was curtailed). However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally. Although simple, they illustrate some of the salient features of ecological models: modelled biological populations experience growth, interact with other populations (as either predators, prey or competitors) and suffer mortality.\n\nA credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi-Ginzburg model. The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.\n\nThe theoretical ecologist Robert Ulanowicz has used information theory tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing mutual information (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and eutrophication.\n\nConway's Game of Life and its variations model ecosystems where proximity of the members of a population are factors in population growth.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1315845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1315845", "title": "Focus (linguistics)", "text": "Focus (linguistics)\n\nFocus (abbreviated ) is a grammatical category that determines which part of the sentence contributes new, non-derivable, or contrastive information.\nFocus is related to information structure. Contrastive focus specifically refers to the coding of information that is contrary to the presuppositions of the interlocutor.\n\nRelated terms include Comment and Rheme.\n\nInformation structure has been described at length by a number of linguists as a grammatical phenomenon. Lexicogrammatical structures that code prominence, or focus, of some information over other information has a particularly significant history dating back to the 19th century. Recent attempts to explain focus phenomena in terms of discourse function, including those by Knud Lambrecht and Talmy Givón, often connect focus with the packaging of new, old, and contrasting information. Lambrecht in particular distinguishes three main types of focus constructions: predicate-focus structure, argument-focus structure, and sentence-focus structure. Focus has also been linked to other more general cognitive processes, including attention orientation.\n\nStandard generative approaches to grammar argue that phonology and semantics cannot exchange information directly (\"See Fig. 1\"). Therefore, syntactic mechanisms including features and transformations include prosodic information regarding focus that is passed to the semantics and phonology. \nFocus may be highlighted either prosodically or syntactically or both, depending on the language. In syntax this can be done assigning focus markers, as shown in (1), or by preposing as shown in (2):\n\n(1) I saw [JOHN] .\n\n(2) [JOHN] , I saw.\n\nIn (1), focus is marked syntactically with the subscripted ‘f’ which is realized phonologically by a nuclear pitch accent. Clefting induces an obligatory intonation break. Therefore, in (2), focus is marked via word order and a nuclear pitch accent.\n\nFocus also relates to phonology and has ramifications for how and where suprasegmental information such as rhythm, stress, and intonation is encoded in the grammar, and in particular intonational tunes that mark focus. Speakers can use pitch accents on syllables to indicate what word(s) are in focus. New words are often accented while given words are not. The accented word(s) forms the focus domain. However, not all of the words in a focus domain need be accented. (See for rules on accent placement and focus-marking). The focus domain can be either \"broad\", as shown in (3), or \"narrow\", as shown in (4) and (5):\n\n(3) Did you see a grey dog or a cat? I saw [a grey DOG] .\n\n(4) Did you see a grey dog or a grey cat? I saw a grey [DOG] .\n\n(5) Did you see a grey dog or a black dog? I saw a [GREY] dog.\n\nThe question/answer paradigm shown in (3)–(5) has been utilized by a variety of theorists to illustrate the range of contexts a sentence containing focus can be used felicitously. Specifically, the question/answer paradigm has been used as a diagnostic for what counts as new information. For example, the focus pattern in (3) would be infelicitous if the question was ‘Did you see a grey dog or a black dog?’.\n\nIn (3) and (4), the pitch accent is marked in bold. In (3), the pitch accent is placed on \"dog\" but the entire noun phrase \"a grey dog\" is under focus. In (4), the pitch accent is also placed on \"dog\" but only the noun \"dog\" is under focus. In (5), pitch accent is placed on \"grey\" and only the adjective \"grey\" is under focus.\n\nHistorically, generative proposals made focus a feature bound to a single word within a sentence. Chomsky and Halle formulated a Nuclear Stress Rule that proposed there to be a relation between the main stress of a sentence and a single constituent. Since this constituent is prominent sententially in a way that can contrast with lexical stress, this was originally referred to as \"nuclear\" stress. The purpose of this rule was to capture the intuition that within each sentence, there is one word in particular that is accented more prominently due to its importance - this is said to form the nucleus of that sentence.\nFocus was later suggested to be a structural position at the beginning of the sentence (or on the left periphery) in Romance languages such as Italian, as the lexical head of a Focus Phrase (or FP, following the X-bar theory of phrase structure). Jackendoff, Selkirk, Rooth, Krifka, Schwarzschild argue that focus consists of a feature that is assigned to a node in the syntactic representation of a sentence.\nBecause focus is now widely seen as corresponding between heavy stress, or nuclear pitch accent, this feature is often associated with the phonologically prominent element(s) of a sentence.\n\nSound structure (phonological and phonetic) studies of focus are not as numerous, as relational language phenomena tend to be of greater interest to syntacticians and semanticists. But this may be changing: a recent study found that not only do focused words and phrases have a higher range of pitch compared to words in the same sentence but that words following the focus in both American English and Mandarin Chinese were lower than normal in pitch and words before a focus are unaffected. The precise usages of focus in natural language are still uncertain. A continuum of possibilities could possibly be defined between precisely enunciated and staccato styles of speech based on variations in pragmatics or timing.\n\nCurrently, there are two central themes in research on focus in generative linguistics. First, given what words or expressions are prominent, what is the meaning of some sentence? Rooth, Jacobs, Krifka, and von Stechow claim that there are lexical items and construction specific-rules that refer directly to the notion of focus. Dryer, Kadmon, Marti, Roberts, Schwarzschild, Vallduvi, and Williams argue for accounts in which general principles of discourse explain focus sensitivity. Second, given the meaning and syntax of some sentence, what words or expressions are prominent?\n\nFocus directly affects the semantics, or meaning, of a sentence. Different ways of pronouncing the sentence affects the meaning, or, what the speaker intends to convey. Focus distinguishes one interpretation of a sentence from other interpretations of the same sentence that do not differ in word order, but may differ in the way in which the words are taken to relate to each other. To see the effects of focus on meaning, consider the following examples:\n\n(6) John only introduced Bill to SUE.\n\nIn (6), accent is placed on Sue. There are two readings of (6) - broad focus shown in (7) and narrow focus shown in (8):\n\n(7) John only [introduced Bill to SUE] .\n\n(8) John only introduced Bill to [SUE] .\n\nThe meaning of (7) can be summarized as \"the only thing John did was introduce Bill to Sue\". The meaning of (8) can be summarized as \"the only person to whom John introduced Bill is Sue\".\n\nIn both (7) and (8), focus is associated with the focus sensitive expression \"only\". This is known as association with focus. The class of focus sensitive expressions in which focus can be associated with includes exclusives (\"only\", \"just\") non-scalar additives (\"merely\", \"too\") scalar additives (\"also\", \"even\"), particularlizers (\"in particular\", \"for example\"), intensifiers, quantificational adverbs, quantificational determiners, sentential connectives, emotives, counterfactuals, superlatives, negation and generics. It is claimed that focus operators must c-command their focus.\n\nBeginning with Rooth, the effects of focus on semantics can be said to be the introduction of a set of alternatives that contrasts with the ordinary semantic meaning of a sentence. Consider the following example:\n\n(9) Mary only likes [SUE] .\n\n(9) is true if and only if \"Mary\" stands in the \"like\" relation to \"Sue\". The set of alternatives that is a resultant of \"Sue\" being focused is the set:\n\nThe relevant alternatives for example (9) might be the set:\n\nIn (9), the set of alternatives is said to contrast with the ordinary semantic meaning of because the speaker indicates that the ordinary semantic meaning is true while every alternative is false. For example, in (9), \"Mary likes Sue\" is true while \"Mary likes Bill\" and \"Mary likes Lisa\" are both false. Generally, the meaning of (9) can be summarized as \"Mary likes Sue and no one else\".\n\nFollowing Jacobs and Williams, Krifka argues differently. Krifka claims focus partitions the semantics into a background part and focus part, represented by the pair:\n\nThe logical form of which represented in lambda calculus is:\n\nThis pair is referred to as a \"structured meaning\". Structured meanings allow for a compositional semantic approach to sentences that involve single or multiple foci. This approach follows Frege's (1897) Principle of Compositionality: the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its parts, and the way in which those parts are combined into structured meanings. Krifka’s structured meaning theory represents focus in a transparent and compositional fashion it encompasses sentences with more than one focus as well as sentences with a single focus. Krifka claims the advantages of structured meanings are twofold: 1) We can access the meaning of an item in focus directly, and 2) Rooth's alternative semantics can be derived from a structured meaning approach but not vice versa. To see Krifka’s approach illustrated, consider the following examples of single focus shown in (10) and multiple foci shown in (11):\n\n(10) John introduced Bill to [SUE] .\n\n(11) John only introduced [BILL] to [SUE] .\n\nGenerally, the meaning of (10) can be summarized as \"John introduced Bill to Sue and no one else\", and the meaning of (11) can be summarized as \"the only pair of persons such that John introduced the first to the second is Bill and Sue\".\n\nSpecifically, the structured meaning of (10) is:\n\nThe background part of the structured meaning is; \"introd (j, b, x)\"; and the focus part is \"s\".\n\nThrough a (modified) form of functional application (or beta reduction), the focus part of (10) and (11) is projected up through the syntax to the sentential level. Importantly, each intermediate level has distinct meaning.\n\nIt has been claimed that \"new\" information in the discourse is accented while \"given\" information is not. Generally, the properties of \"new\" and \"given\" are referred to as a word's discourse status. Definitions of \"new\" and \"given\" vary. Halliday defines \"given\" as “anaphorically” recoverable, while \"new\" is defined to be “textually and situationally non-derivable information”. To illustrate this point, consider the following discourse in (12) and (13):\n\n(12) Why don’t you have some French TOAST?\n\n(13) I’ve forgotten how to MAKE French toast.\n\nIn (13) we note that the verb \"make\" is not given by the sentence in (12). It is discourse new. Therefore, it is available for accentuation. However, \"toast\" in (13) is given in (12). Therefore, it is not available for accentuation. As previously mentioned, pitch accenting can relate to focus. Accented words are often said to be in focus or F-marked often represented by F-markers. The relationship between accent placement is mediated through the discourse status of particular syntactic nodes. The percolation of F-markings in a syntactic tree is sensitive to argument structure and head-phrase relations.\n\nSelkirk develops an explicit account of how F-marking propagates up syntactic trees. Accenting indicates F-marking. F-marking projects up a given syntactic tree such that both lexical items, i.e. terminal nodes and phrasal levels, i.e. nonterminal nodes, can be F-marked. Specifically, a set of rules determines how and where F-marking occurs in the syntax. These rules are shown in (1) and (2):\n\n(14) Basic Rule: An accented word is f-marked.\n\n(15) Focus Projection:\n\nTo see how (14) and (15) apply, consider the following example:\n\nBecause there is no rule in (14) or (15) that licenses F-marking to the direct object from any other node, the direct object \"parrot\" must be accented as indicated in bold. Rule (15b) allows F-marking to project from the direct object to the head verb \"adopted\". Rule (15a) allows F-marking to project from the head verb to the VP \"adopted a parrot\". Selkirk assumes the subject \"Judy\" is accented if F-marked as indicated in bold.\n\nSchwarzschild points out weaknesses in Selkirk’s ability to predict accent placement based on facts about the discourse. Selkirk’s theory says nothing about how accentuation arises in sentences with entirely old information. She does not fully articulate the notion of discourse status and its relation to accent marking. Schwarzschild differs from Selkirk in that he develops a more robust model of discourse status. Discourse status is determined via the entailments of the context. This is achieved through the definition in (16):\n\n(16) Definition of given: An utterance of U counts as given if it has a salient antecedent A and\n\nThe operation in (16b) can apply to any constituent. formula_7-type-shifting “is a way of transforming syntactic constituents into full propositions so that it is possible to check whether they are entailed by the context”. For example, the result of formula_7-type-shifting the VP in (17) is (18):\n\n(17) [hums a happy tune]\n\n(18) formula_7\"x\"[\"x\" hums a happy tune]\n\nNote that (18) is a full proposition. The existential F-closure in (16b) refers to the operation of replacing the highest F-marked node with an existentially closed variable. The operation is shown in (19) and (20):\n\n(19) formula_7\"x\"[\"x\" hums [a happy tune ] ]\n\n(20) formula_7\"Y\"formula_7\"x\"[\"x\" hums \"Y\"]\n\nGiven the discourse context in (21a) it is possible to determine the discourse status of any syntactic node in (21b):\n\nIf the VP in (21a) is the salient antecedent for the VP in (21b), then the VP in (21b) counts as given. formula_7-type-shifed VP in (21a) is shown in (22). The existential F-closure of the VP in (21b) is shown in (23):\n\n(22) formula_7\"x\"[\"x\" hums a happy tune]\n\n(23) formula_7\"Y\"formula_7\"x\"[\"x\" hums \"Y\"]\n\n(22) entails (23). Therefore, the VP of (21b) counts as given. Schwarzschild assumes an optimality theoretic grammar. Accent placement is determined by a set of violable, hierarchically ranked constraints as shown in (24):\n\nThe ranking Schwarzschild proposes is seen in (25):\n\n(25) GIVENness, Foc » AvoidF » HeadArg\n\nAs seen, GIVENness relates F-marking to discourse status. Foc relates F-marking to accent placement. Foc simply requires that a constituent(s) of an F-marked phrase contain an accent. AvoidF states that less F-marking is preferable to more F-marking. HeadArg encodes the head-argument asymmetry into the grammar directly.\n\nRecent empirical work by German \"et al.\" suggests that both Selkirk’s and Schwarzschild’s theory of accentuation and F-marking makes incorrect predictions. Consider the following context:\n\n(26) Are the children playing their game?\n\n(27) Paul took down their tent that they play their game in.\n\nIt has been noted that prepositions are intrinsically weak and do not readily take accent. However, both Selkirk and Schwarzschild predict that in the narrow focus context, an accent will occur at most on the preposition in (27) as shown in (28):\n\n(28) Paul took down their tent that they [play their game [in t ] ].\n\nHowever, the production experiment reported in German \"et al.\" showed that subjects are more likely to accent verbs or nouns as opposed to prepositions in the narrow focused context, thus ruling out accent patterns shown in (28). German \"et al.\" argue for a stochastic constraint-based grammar similar to Anttila and Boersma that more fluidly accounts for how speakers accent words in discourse.\n\n\n"}

Futurist is not in the sense of the art movement futurism.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary identifies the earliest use of the term \"futurism\" in English as 1842, to refer, in a theological context, to the Christian eschatological tendency of that time. The next recorded use is the label adopted by the Italian and Russian Futurists, the artistic, literary and political movements of the 1920s and 1930s which sought to reject the past and fervently embrace speed, technology, and often violent change.\n\nThere are a number of organizations that specialize in this field including the World Future Society.\n\nVisionary writers such as Jules Verne, Edward Bellamy, and H. G. Wells were not in their day characterized as futurists. The term futurology in its contemporary sense was first coined in the mid‑1940s by the German Professor Ossip K. Flechtheim, who proposed a new science of probability. Flechtheim argued that even if systematic forecasting did no more than unveil the subset of statistically highly probable processes of change and charted their advance, it would still be of crucial social value.\n\nIn the mid‑1940s the first professional \"futurist\" consulting institutions like RAND and SRI began to engage in long-range planning, systematic trend watching, scenario development, and visioning, at first under World War II military and government contract and, beginning in the 1950s, for private institutions and corporations. The period from the late 1940s to the mid‑1960s laid the conceptual and methodological foundations of the modern futures studies field. Bertrand de Jouvenel's \"The Art of Conjecture\" in 1963 and Dennis Gabor's \"Inventing the Future\" in 1964 are considered key early works, and the first U.S. university course devoted entirely to the future was taught by the late Alvin Toffler at the New School in 1966.\n\nMore generally, the label includes such disparate lay, professional, and academic groups as visionaries, foresight consultants, corporate strategists, policy analysts, cultural critics, planners, marketers, forecasters, prediction market developers, roadmappers, operations researchers, investment managers, actuaries, and other risk analyzers, and future-oriented individuals educated in every academic discipline, including anthropology, complexity studies, computer science, economics, engineering, urban design, evolutionary biology, history, management, mathematics, philosophy, physical sciences, political science, psychology, sociology, systems theory, technology studies, trend analysis, and other disciplines.\n\n\"Futures studies\"—sometimes referred to as futurology, futures research, and foresight—can be summarized as being concerned with \"three P's and a W\", i.e. \"possible, probable, and preferable\" futures, plus \"wildcards\", which are low-probability, high-impact events, should they occur. Even with high-profile, probable events, such as the fall of telecommunications costs, the growth of the internet, or the aging demographics of particular countries, there is often significant uncertainty in the rate or continuation of a trend. Thus, a key part of futures analysis is the managing of uncertainty and risk.\n\nNot all futurists engage in the practice of futurology as generally defined. Pre-conventional futurists (see below) would generally not. And while religious futurists, astrologers, occultists, New Age diviners, etc. use methodologies that include study, none of their personal revelation or belief-based work would fall within a consensus definition of futurology as used in academics or by futures studies professionals.\n\nSeveral authors have become recognized as futurists. They research trends, particularly in technology, and write their observations, conclusions, and predictions. In earlier eras, many futurists were at academic institutions. John McHale, author of \"The Future of the Future\", published a \"Futures Directory\", and directed a think tank called The Centre For Integrative Studies at a university. Futurists have started consulting groups or earn money as speakers, with examples including Alvin Toffler, John Naisbitt and Patrick Dixon. Frank Feather is a business speaker that presents himself as a pragmatic futurist. Some futurists have commonalities with science fiction, and some science-fiction writers, such as Arthur C. Clarke, are known as futurists. In the introduction to \"The Left Hand of Darkness\", Ursula K. Le Guin distinguished futurists from novelists, writing of the study as the business of prophets, clairvoyants, and futurists. In her words, \"a novelist's business is lying\".\n\nA survey of 108 futurists found the following shared assumptions:\n\n\nThe term has also been used to refer to popular electronic music acts who emerged in the 1970s, such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and The Human League.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49072410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49072410", "title": "German Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine Radar Equipment of World War II", "text": "German Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine Radar Equipment of World War II\n\nGerman Luftwaffe and Navy Kriegsmarine Radar Equipment during World War II, relied on an increasingly diverse array of communications, IFF and RDF equipment for its function. Most of this equipment received the generic prefix FuG (), meaning \"radio equipment\". During the war, Germany renumbered their radars. From using the year of introduction as their number they moved to a different numbering scheme.\n\nNo German ground radar was accurate enough for Flak fire direction. The operation method for Flak during the day was to use the radar to be used to set the optical fire control for the flak onto the target. Once acquired the flak was controlled by the optical equipment to complete the engagement. During the night the Radar would be used to indicate the target to the search light crews. The rest of the engagement would be carried out optically. During the day fighters would be directed with sufficient precision that they would be able to see their targets and during The night they would use their onboard AI radar to find the target after initial direction from the ground-based radars.\n\nThe Würzburg was first operational in the summer of 1940, had a parabolic shaped antenna with a diameter of about 3metres and in some models could be folded in half for transport. The Würzburg was produced in the thousands with various estimated figures being between 3000 and 4000 with up to 1500 sets of Würzburg Riese. The antenna of the Würzburg weighed over 9.5 tons and its parabolic surface had a diameter equal to 7.5 metres and a focal length of one metres and 70 cm. Only one German company had the technical skill to build these radars, and that was \nZeppelin. The name of the unit was chosen at random by pointing at a map of Germany and Würzburg was chosen.\n\nFuMG 62 / FuMG 39 Würzburg: 3D fire-control radar. Used to direct the flack optical directors and searchlights. Wavelength 50 cm approx. In response to jamming various models of Würzburg radar were developed to operate on various frequencies called \"Islands\".\n\nWürzburg A First production version introduced in 1940. 50 cm operating wavelength. Operation range was approximately 30 km. Included an IFF system that worked with the FuG 25z airborne unit.\n\nWürzburg B Integrated IR telescope to increase accuracy. Proved unsatisfactory and not placed into production.\n\nWürzburg C Replaced the model A in production in 1941. Had lobe switching to improve accuracy. On this unit the integral IFF system was replaced by a system based on the FuG 25a airborne. To support this system which worked at approx 125-160 MHz two antenna were placed inside the main dish. A separate interrogation and receiving units were attached to show the IFF responses.\n\nWürzburg D Replaced the model C in production in 1942. It now had a usable range of approximately 40 km. Conical scan was used for fine accuracy. The IFF antenna was now fitted in the center of the dish rather than on the sides. Better instruments were fitted and generally it was the best of the small Würzburg.\n\nFuMG 65 Würzburg Riese(Giant): The electronics of the D model Würzburg combined with a 7-meter dish to improve resolution and range. Range approx 70 km. Version E was a modified unit to fit on railroad flatcars to produce a mobile Flak radar system. Version G had the 2.4-meter antenna and electronics from a Freya installed. The antenna dipoles were inside the reflector. The reason for this was that the allies were flying very high recon flights which were above the maximum height of the Freya. The standard Würzburg Riese's 50 cm beam was too narrow to find them directly. By combining the two systems the Freya could set the Würzburg Riese onto the target.\n\nFuMG 63 Mainz The Mainz, introduced in 1941, was a development from the Wurzburg with its 3-meter solid metal reflector mounted on top of the same type of control car as used by the ‘Kurmark’. Its range was 25–35 km with an accuracy of ±10–20 meters, azimuth 0.1 degrees, and elevation ±0.3-0.5 degrees. Only 51 units were produced before being superseded by the ‘Mannheim’.\n\nFuMG 64 Mannheim The Mannheim was an advanced development from the ‘Mainz’. It also had a 3-meter reflector, which was now made from a lattice framework covered in a fine mesh. This was fixed to the front of a control cabin and the whole apparatus was rotated electrically. Its range was 25–35 km, with an accuracy of ±10–15 meters; azimuth and elevation accuracy of ±0.15 degrees. Though accurate enough to control Flak guns it was not deployed in large numbers. This was due to its cost (time and materials to manufacture was about 3 time that of a Würzburg D.\n\nFuMG 75 Mannheim Riese Just as the Wurzburg’s performance was greatly improved when fitted with a 7-meter reflector, so was the Mannheim’s, and the result called a Mannheim Riese (Giant Mannheim). There was an optical device for the initial visual acquisition of the target. With its narrow beam it was relatively immune from ‘Window’. Its accuracy and automatic tracking enabled it to be used in anti-aircraft missile research to track and control the missiles in flight. Only a handful were manufactured.\n\nFuMG 68 Ansbach There was a need for a mobile radar with the range and accuracy of the ‘Mannheim’. The result, in 1944, was the Ansbach. It had a collapsible reflector of diameter 4.5 meters, operating on a wavelength of 53.6 cm, and peak power of 8 kW, giving it a normal range 25–35 km (70 km in search mode) with an accuracy of 30–40 meters. Azimuth and elevation accuracy was around ±0.2°. The antenna and reflector were remote controlled from a Bayern control van up to 30 meters away. The control system was based on the remote control system of the Michael microwave communication system, this was based on the Ward-Leonard AC/DC control system. The Ansbach was to be installed in large Flak batteries with six or more guns, but only a few were produced by the end of the war, and these didn’t see operational service\n\nFuMG 450 Freya / FuMG 41G: This was a 2D Early warning radar. (2D means unable to indicate height). It was used for fighter direction and target indication for the Würzburg. Operating wavelength of approx 2.4 meters (125 MHz). In response to jamming various models were developed to operate on various frequencies called \"Islands\". Over 1000 units delivered in various models\n\nFuMG 401 / FMG 42 FREYA - LZ (Models A - D). An Air portable version, the model differences were due to an operating frequency range being in 4 descrete bands between 91 and 200 MHz.\n\nFreya-Rotschwarz and Freya-Grünschwarz: These two systems were Freya modified to operate on the same frequency as the British radio navigation system GEE to avoid jamming. However, as by the time they were ready the Germans were jamming GEE it is not clear whether any were ever deployed.\n\nFuMG 451 A Freya Flamme: Freya which had been built to use the \"Island D\" band were modified to be able to trigger the British IFF equipment. Ranges of up to 450 km were obtained. Fell from use as British IFF procedures improved.\n\nFuMG 401 Freya Fahrstuhl: A 3D version of the Fraya. (3D means could measure height). Measurements made by moving the antenna up and down on a rack. Only a very rough estimation of height available. originally intended for early warning most of the systems produced went to help \"jammed\" Würzburg\n\nFreya EGON: EGON stood for Erstling Gemse Offensive Navigation system. Where Erstling was the codename of the Fug25a transceiver in the aircraft and Gemse was the codename for the receiver. The system operated on a principle similar to the British OBOE navigation system. An IFF signal was sent from a Freya, that had had its receiver antenna removed, to the aircraft. The Fug25a in the aircraft responded and the received signal was displayed as a range offset on the Freya display. Using a second transmitter and triangulation the position of the aircraft was resolved. Though the system was tested to guide night fighters it was found to be to limited by the number of aircraft that it could control at one time (the same limitation was found with Oboe). The \"Y system\" was used instead for night fighter control. The EGON system was used to control pathfinders for bombing raids over both England and Russia, however by now the Luftwaffe bomber force was running out of planes, pilots and fuel so the results were minimal. Work was done using a third transmitter to improve system performance. Range with a normal Freya was up to 250 km, work was underway to use a Wasserman system instead of a Freya to increase range too 350 km. (the Freya signal was to weak to trigger the Fug25a at ranges beyond 250 km), but this was not completed.\n\nFor area air defense (vs point defense) Freya's range was found to be insufficient. This led to attempts to use Freya technology to achieve greater range. This resulted in the Wassermann and Mammut. All though the Mammut units achieved their aims they were large installations, with large arrays built on bunkers. This resulted in long building times and vulnerability to air attacks. The Wassermann was a better solution in that being smaller they were harder to locate and quicker to build, 3–4 weeks. However sources indicate that they never achieved the desired range of 400 km, the best was approx 300 km. This may be why there were so many variants deployed.\n\nFuMG 401 Mammut: First deployed in 1942 this was a long range 2 D search radar. It consisted of 8 Freya class antenna arranged in a 4 x 2 configuration. It measured 25 meters wide and ten meters high and was mounted on four pylons fixed in concrete. Some installations had a second array mounted back-to-back. Each array could be electronically swung through about 100 degrees, so the dual sided array could look behind itself to continue to track bombers as they flew into Germany. Frequency was the same as Freya (125 MHz). Range was up to 300 km with a transmit power of 200 KW. Installations being very large took up to 4 months to build.\n\nFuMG 402 Wassermann: This system was deployed in 1942. It was basically 6 Freya antenna mounted on a rotation cylinder. Frequencies were similar to Freya (125 MHz) transmit power was 100 KW resulting in a usable range of approx 200 km. Three main versions were produced with sub variants in each class.\n\nWassermann L: The original light version. Some sources indicate that it had structural problems.\n\nWassermann S: The heavy version. first deployed late 1942 Some sources indicate it had more than 6 arrays.\n\nWassermann M: The last family were the medium class units. Again it is not clear exactly how many Freya arrays were attached to the mast. In 1944 this version received a modification that allowed it to electronically tilt its beams by 16 degrees which allowed it to perform height determination turning its into a 3 D search radar.\n\nElefant & See Elefant: These bi-static radars were an attempt to combine jamming resistance with long range. They operated in two bands 23–28 MHz or 32–38 MHz. Range was approximately 400 km but under certain RF conditions much greater ranges were obtained. Antenna were usually mounted on Wassermann towers (all units differed in detail from each other). 3 Elefants were in operation at the end of the war with one See Elefant. Sources are unclear what the difference between the two types were.\n\nThe first type of early-warning radar set giving panoramic display which come into operation in usually referred to as the Jagdschloss, although it’s official designation is Jagdschloss F, to distinguish it from later types, such as the Michael B and Z.\n\nJagdschloss F: The antenna was 24 m wide and 3 m high, consisting of sixteen pairs of double horizontal transmit and receive dipoles. Above this, an 8.5 metre wide antenna array of eight vertical dipoles was mounted for the IFF.The first 62 Jagdschloss were of the Voll Wismar type using wide band antenna covering the band 1.90-2.20 metres. Another 18, used the band 1.20–1.90 meters. Range was 100 km. An optional feature known as Landbriefträger (Postman) was a remote PPI display for use with Jagdschloss. This allowed the PPI display from the radar station to be sent simultaneously to command HQ by HF cable, or by a UHF radio link.\n\nJagdschloss Michael B: A ponderous aerial array of two rows of eighteen Würzburg mirrors measuring 56 metres long x 7 metres high was used in the Würzmann experimental early-warning radar, and formed the serial array for Jagdschloss Michael B with the array in a horizontal position. The wavelength employed, was\nthat of a Voll Wismar 53.0-63.8 cm. Range approx 250 km. None may have entered service, though one source mentions one entering service.\n\nForsthaus F: This system was a development of the Jagdschloss Michael B using the so-called Euklid 25–29 cm. waveband employed by the Navy. Once more a\nvery long aerial array 48 metres long and about 8 metres high was used, employing a cylindrical paraboloid. A wave guide antenna (Hohlraumstrahler) was placed along the focal line with a second and a third wave guide parallel to it above and below respectively.Range was expected to be over 200 km. Probably none completed.\n\nForsthaus KF: Development of the Forsthaus F. Reduced in size so that the system would fit in a railway carriage. Antenna 24 meters long. Range 120 km.\n\nDreh Freya: This set, which was also known as Freya Panorama, was first introduced in June 1944. It consisted of a Freya aerial of the Breitband type working in Bereich I (1.90-2.50), the frequency of which could be adjusted at will. The aerial was so built that it rotated through 360° and gave a remote\npanoramic presentation. About 20 equipments were in use in January 1945. The range claimed for it was only about 100 km.\n\nJagdhütte:This apparatus, which was produced by Siemens, gave a panoramic P.P.I. display of the German I.F.F. responses, using 24 metre or 36 metre rotating aerials. The wavelength employed was 2.40 metres and it was planned, with its aid, to trigger off the FuGe 25A. In this way friendly fighters were to be controlled from the ground at ranges up to about 300 km. It was fully realised that if the FuGe 25A frequency was ever jammed the Jagdhütte would be useless, but it was not considered likely that the Allies would attempt to jam it. Small numbers may have been completed at the wend of the war.\n\nJagdwagen: Jagdwagen was designed as a mobile Panoramic radar to control fighters at close ranges immediately behind the front. It was a project of the firm of Lorenz. The aerials were considerably smaller than the Jagdhütte, the array being only 8 metres long. The aerial array was to be mounted on the Kumbach stand as used in the Egerland Flak set. The frequency bend used was that of the A.S.V. set Hohentwiel namely 53–59 cm. Range 40–60 km. Prototypes only.\n\nJagdhaus (FuMG 404): Jagdhaus was designed and built by Lorenz in 1944 as an early warning radar. It was the most powerful radar built by the Germans, with a peak pulse power of 300 kW, which Lorenz planned to increase to 750 kW. The whole assembly was the size of a house, which is possibly how it got its name; ‘haus’ being the German for ‘house’. The rotating upper part of the construction housed the separate parabolic transmit and receive antennae and reflectors, with the IFF above them as usual. It weighed 48 tons and rotated at 10 rpm. It operated on wavelengths of 1.4 to 1.8 metres, and had a range of about 300 km. It could measure altitude, azimuth and range. The control room was located below the antennae, from which its PPI image was also transmitted to command HQ at Charlottenberg by Landbrieftrager, similar to the Jagdschloss system. It is believed that only one Jagdhaus was constructed, which fell into Soviet hands when it was captured by their troops in 1945, during which time it was damaged. The Soviets compelled the Germans to repair it and instruct them in its operation.\n\nLichtenstein B/C - FuG 202: Low-UHF band frequency range, introduced in 1941 it was the initial AI radar. Deployed in large numbers with 32-dipole element \"Matratze\" (mattress) antenna arrays, it operated on the 61 cm wavelength. Its range was (in theory) 2–3 km but in practise was found to be dependent on factors such as height. Compromised to the Allies on May 9, 1943.\n\nLichtenstein C-1 - FuG 212: Introduced in 1943, this was an improved version of the FuG 202.\n\nLichtenstein SN2 - FuG 220: Low-mid VHF band frequency range, introduced in 1943 in response to Allied jamming, and used an eight-dipole \"Hirschgeweih\" (atag's antlers) antenna array. Transmitter power of 2Kw on 3.3 meters. Range was increased to 6 km. Minimum range was 400 m which was found to be a problem, hence aircraft carried it and FuG202. Later versions did away for the need for the Fug 202. Compromised to the Allies in July 1944.\n\nLichtenstein SN3 - FuG 228: A higher powered version of the SN2. Range increased to 8 km. Only a small number accepted into service, perhaps only prototypes.\n\nNeptun 3 - Fug 218: A replacement for SN2, deployed late 1944 after SN2 was jammed. Wavelength 1.6 to 1.9 meters, most often using same, eight-dipole \"stag's antlers\" antenna array with shorter dipole elements. Range up to 5 km. Some were fitted to me 262 to create night fighters that could catch Mosquito intruders.\n\nBerlin N3/N4: Experimental units.\n\nBremen - FuG 244: (also known as Berlin D) Berlin A with the frequency changed to 3 cm (10 GHz) rather than 9 cm. Experimental.\n\nBremen O - FuG 245: Another experiments 3 cm unit.\n\nNeptun: Early system - It failed its acceptance tests - the system was later reworked into an Airborne intercept set.\n\nHohentwiel (FuG 200); UHF-band radar, operated at wavelength between 52 and 57 cm. Range was between 10 km for a small vessel like a surfaced submarine to 70 km for a large ship. Under the best circumstances it could see the coast at approx 150 km. It had separate antennae for transmit and receive. The transmit antenna was centrally mounted, pointing forward, while the two receive antennae were mounted either side, pointing outwards by 30 degrees, giving it a search beam width of about 120 degrees. Each antenna array consisted of sixteen horizontally polarised dipoles, mounted in four groups of four in a vertical stack.\n\nA variant of the Hohentwiel the Tiefentwiel (FuMG407); was tried as an Air Surveillance radar on the coast to try and detect low flying aircraft.\n\nFuMO 1 - Calis A: Its 6.2 x 2.5m antenna consisted of 2 rows of eight full wave vertical dipoles. Its wavelength was 82 cm and its range depended on the height it was installed above sea level, but typically was about 15–20 km. Given the frequency low angle reflections from the surface, also known a clutter would have been an issue.\n\nFuMO 2 - Calis B: Improved version of the FuMO 1 - similar clutter problems but improved transmitter and accuracy.\n\nFuMO 3 - Zerstorersaule: A version of the destroyer radar modified for land use.\n\nFuMO 4 - Dunkirchen : Improved version of the FuMo 2 - similar otherwise\n\nFuMO 5 - Boulogne: Yet another improved version of the FuMO 2 - increased transmitter power again with an improved aerial - usable range now 40 – 50 km.\n\nFuMO 11 - Renner: 3M antenna from a Wurzburg combined with a 9 cm \"Berlin\" unit and mounted on a Seetakt base optimized for sea search rather than air search. Sources differ on usable range.\n\nFuMO 12 & 13: Improved Renner units to attempt to compensate for poor reliability with the original unit.\n\nFuMO 15 - Sheer: Combination of a Berlin 9 cm and an Antenna from a Giant Wurzburg - seems to have been optimized for surface search in the same was as the Renner series was.\n\nFuMO 51 - Mammut G: Version of the Luftwaffe FuMO401 but with Seetakt antenna and waveforms to optimise it for surface search rather than air search.\n\nFuMO 214 - Giant Wurzburg: Naval designation for the airforce unit.\n\nFuMO 215 See Reise: Improved FuMO 214\n\nFuMO 52: Naval designation for the FuMG 401 Mammut C.\n\nFuMO 64 : A version of the Hohentwiel L ASV radar modifier for coastal air search - different from the unsuccessful xxx\n\nFuMO 221: Naval designation for the FuMG 64 Mannheim.\n\nFuMO 301 - 303: Versions of the FuMG 39-41 Freya\n\nFuMO 311 - 318: Versions of the Freya working on other frequencies (Around 2.2 Meters) from the normal Freya. Sometimes known as the Freiburg\n\nFuMO 321 - 328: Based on the fuMO311 family of units but workig at 1.5 meters.\n\nFuMO 331: Naval designation for the FuMG 402 Wassermann M\n\nFuMO 371: Naval designation for the FuMG 403 Jagdschloss\n\nFuMO 201: Flakleit - Using Seetakt 80 cm technology a 3D radar mounted on an underground armoured turret ( originally an optical rangefinder) small numbers produced. Multiple antenna. Manufactured by GEMA.\n\nFuMO 211 - 213: Naval designation for the FuMG 62 family or radars - the Wurzburg A,C & D.\n\nFuMO 215: See Reise.\n\nFuMO 221: Mannheim.\n\nFuMO 111: Barbara, 9 cm fire control radar based on modifying a FuMO 15 Giant Wurzburg to operate at 9 cm. Only experimental radars produced\n\nFuMO 214: A Wurzburg Reise reconfigured for use as a naval radar with a range of approximately 50 – 70 km against surface targets.\n\nFuMO 215: Improved range version of the FuMO214.\n\nAll though the Germans were carrying out research at centimeter wavelengths at the start of the war the work was abandoned as it was decided that the war would be over before the research & development could be completed. In February 1943 a RAF Stirling bomber was shot down over Rotterdam and a damaged H2S system was recovered. The Germans started a crash development program to use the information deduced from the captured system. All though a range of prototypes were produced, very few reached front line troops. Due to the device being recovered near Rotterdam the Germans used that name in several code names for the Centimeter (9 cm) systems, such as \"Rotterdam Device\".\n\nRotterdam: To get the quickest start with development, German industry copied, as far as possible, the H2S system. Approximately 20 systems were manufactured for R&D work. They led to the Roderich jammer and the Berlin & Korfu receivers.\n\nJagdschloss Z: The 9 cm version of the Jagdschloss F panoramic radar system. Prototypes only.\n\nForsthaus Z: The 9 cm version of the Forsthaus panoramic search radar. Prototypes only.\n\nFuMG 77: Rotterheim. A combination of the 9 cm receiver/transmitter of the Berlin system with the Antenna and other systems from a Mannheim. Its range was about 30 km and it was found to be unaffected by allied jamming. Its name changed to Marbach V later in the war.\n\nFuMG 76: Marbach. A combination of the Berlin transmitter/receiver with the Ansback 4.5 meter reflector and systems. Controlled by the \"Michael\" remote control system. Sources suggest that 3 systems were completed.\n\nFuMG 74: Kulmbach. A 9 cm panoramic search radar. 6 meter antenna and remote controlled like the FuMG76. When combined with that radar it was known as the Egerland system. Only 2 completed. range of approx 50 km.\n\nFuG 221 Freya-Halbe : This was a Freya modified to locate British airborne jammers. Development completed but due to lack of parts never deployed.\n\nFuG 221 Rosendahl; This was a Freya modified to locate British bombers by tracking their Monica warning radar emissions. By the time development was completed the British had ceased using Monica, so never deployed\n\nFuG 223: A family of passive airborne receivers tuned to various radar bands such as Freya and Würzburg. Designed to allow night fighters to home onto bombers fitted with jammers against those radars. The Fug223 was a version build from surplus FuG 227 components that detected reflected energy from an aircraft being illuminated by a ground radar. In this way it was an example of an early semi-active radar homing system. In order to work it seems that the radar beam had to illuminate the target and the night fighter so that the two receivers could be synchronized. Used by one test and development squadron at the end of the war.\n\nFuG 227: Built using some components from the FuG 220 range of AI equipment. This was a passive device which allowed night fighters to home onto bombers which had their rear warning 'Monica' active. Monica was a short range VHF radar (200 MHz band) which was fitted to the tail of British heavy bombers facing down and back to give the rear turret gunner a warning display. Using this equipment the night fighters could achieve intercept with apparent ease. Extremely effective until the British captured a Me 110 with FuG227 installed and realised its mode of operation. there after Monica was removed from bombers and FuG227 ceased to have any value.\n\nKlein Heidelberg was the code-name give to a passive radar system devised in 1941. The system was a bi-static radar system. What was unusual was that the transmitters were British rather than German! The system worked by using the reflections from the Chain Home (British coastal radar system) rather than transmitters associated with the receivers. Klein Heidelberg worked by sensing Chain Home (CH) transmission pulses directly with a small auxiliary antenna, close to the main antenna, whose receiver was tuned to a particular CH station whose exact location, bearing and range was known. The CH signal was then used to synchronise the KH with the CH transmission pulses. The CH pulse started a circular trace on a cathode ray tube (CRT) divided into forty sections. The main antenna received the reflection of these pulses from the target and displayed them on the CRT. Range was between 300–600 km. The display was 2D. Resolution was not very good but it allowed the Germans to see bomber formations forming up over England and the general path of the bomber streams. Its big advantage was it was not possible for the British to jam without jamming their own radars. The system entered service in late 1943 and by late 1944 six system were commissioned on the Dutch coast.\nFuG 350 Naxos & FuG 351 Korfu: This was a family or radar detectors that operated in the 8 to 12 cm band. They were primarily designed to locate Allied H2S radar transmissions. A range of antenna were used some stationary and some rotating. There were intended to be air, land and maritime versions. However Naxos had a resolution problem that limited its ability to distinguish individual aircraft. This allowed the night fighter to locate the bomber stream but not usually individual bombers. This was not usually an issue with the maritime based system (primarily U boats) as there was usually only one aircraft detected at a time. To reduce this issue an improved version the Korfu was developed. It was intended to field Korfu as a replacement for Naxos in all three versions but due to a shortage of components only the land based version was fielded where is resolution could be used to the best effect.\n\nFuG 350 Naxos Z: The original system, detected H2S radar system on bombers. Unable to distinguish individual bombers nor the 10 GHz H2X Allied bombing radar, but could reliably guide the fighter into the bomber stream.\n\nFuG 350 Naxos ZR: Additional aerials added a tail warning system which allowed British night-fighters to be detected.\n\nFuG 350 Naxos ZX: 3 cm version for detecting allied H2X radars. Not known to have ever been fielded.\n\nFuG 350 Naxos RX: 3 cm version of the Naxos ZR. Not known to have ever been fielded.\n\nFuG 350 Naxos ZD: Combined Z and ZX, allowing 9 cm and 3 cm detection in the same system.\n\nFuG 351 Korfu Z: Entered production late 1944, due to shortage of components only ground-based versions deployed though an airborne version completed development. better range and discrimination than Naxos.\n\nFuG 280 Kiel Z: IR based passive receiver. 10 degree field of view - display via CRT. problems with discrimination between fires aircraft and other IR sources.\n\n\n"}

It is used in the injection moulding and the printing industry.\nIt is made by a hand injection molding machine. It is a simple machine which contains a barrel, handle, nozzle, mold and heaters. \n\nIn the printing industry, a hand mould specifically refers to a two-part mould used for casting hand-made type. Inside the mould is a matrix.\n\nIn particular, it refers to a system for casting movable type, pioneered by Johannes Gutenberg, which was widely used in the early era of printing in Europe (15th-16th century).\n\nIn this method, the type was made by punching a letter-shaped cavity in a matrix made of some soft metal (typically copper). Then this matrix would be held in the lower part of the mould, the upper part would close on it, and molten type metal would be poured into the cavity. Using the hand mould, the printer could quickly make any additional type he might need.\n\nIn injection moulding, hand moulds refer to simple moulds that have no provision for heat, cooling, or ejection. This means when a hand mould is cycled universal heating plates are required to warm the moulds and the moulds must be removed after each cycle to remove the mouldings. This drastically increases the cycle time, which limits it to short runs, but to offset this is the low cost of the mould. They are usually single cavity moulds, but may be multi-cavity if the moulding is quite small. They are usually only of a two or three plate design because of the simplicity of the parts. If only a short run is required then the moulds may be made from aluminum or brass, but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional steels.\n\nHand cast bullets remain popular with the handloading, muzzleloading and small custom ammunition loading communities. In a tradition dating back to the beginning of firearms, molds matched to the bore (and the chamber for breech loading weapons) are custom made for each weapon. Anywhere from one to six cavities are carved into the molding block, along with appropriate gates and sprues. As the blocks are now usually made out of aluminum, which does not allow lead alloys to stick, only a small amount of parting compound is needed.\n"}

{"id": "5205877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5205877", "title": "History of Swedish", "text": "History of Swedish\n\nIn the 9th century, Old Norse began to diverge into Old West Norse (Norway and Iceland) and Old East Norse (Sweden and Denmark). In the 12th century, the dialects of Denmark and Sweden began to diverge, becoming Old Danish and Old Swedish in the 13th century. All were heavily influenced by Middle Low German during the medieval period. Though stages of language development are never as sharply delimited as implied here, and should not be taken too literally, the system of subdivisions used in this article is the most commonly used by Swedish linguists and is used for the sake of practicality.\n\nIn the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse. This language began to undergo new changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted the appearance of two similar dialects, \"Old West Norse\" (Norway and Iceland) and \"Old East Norse\" (Denmark and Sweden).\n\nOld East Norse is in Sweden called \"Runic Swedish\" and in Denmark \"Runic Danish\", but until the 12th century, the dialect was the same in the two countries. The dialects are called \"runic\" because the main body of text appears in the runic alphabet. Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the Elder Futhark alphabet, Old Norse was written with the Younger Futhark alphabet, which only had 16 letters. Due to the limited number of runes, some runes were used for a range of phonemes, such as the rune for the vowel \"u\" which was also used for the vowels \"o\", \"ø\" and \"y\", and the rune for \"i\" which was also used for \"e\".\n\nA change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the diphthong \"æi\" (Old West Norse \"ei\") to the monophthong \"e\", as in \"stæin\" to \"sten\". This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read \"stain\" and the later \"stin\". There was also a change of \"au\" as in \"dauðr\" into \"ø\" as in \"døðr\". This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from \"tauþr\" into \"tuþr\". Moreover, the \"øy\" (Old West Norse \"ey\") diphthong changed into \"ø\" as well, as in the Old Norse word for \"island\".\n\nFrom 1100 onwards, the dialect of Denmark began to diverge from that of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, isoglosses, ranging from Zealand to Svealand.\n\nOld Swedish is the term used for the medieval Swedish language, starting in 1225. Among the most important documents of the period written in Latin script is the oldest of the provincial law codes, \"Västgötalagen\", of which fragments dated to 1250 have been found. The main influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the Catholic Church and various monastic orders, introducing many Greek and Latin loanwords. With the rise of Hanseatic power in the late 13th and early 14th century, the influence of Middle Low German became ever more present. The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of German speaking immigrants. Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society, and brought terms from their mother tongue into the vocabulary. Besides a great number of loan words for areas like warfare, trade and administration, general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions where imported. Almost all of the naval terms were also borrowed from Dutch.\n\nEarly medieval Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex case structure and had not yet experienced a reduction of the gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the modern nominative and genitive there were also dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having the genders masculine, feminine and neuter. Most of the masculine and feminine nouns were later grouped together into a common gender. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish. The old inflections remained common in high prose style until the 18th century, and in some dialects into the early 20th century.\n\nA transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination \"ae\" as æand sometimes as a'though it varied between individuals and regions. The combination \"aa\" similarly became a, and \"oe\" became o. These three were later to evolve into the separate letters ä, å and ö.\n\nModern Swedish begins with the advent of the printing press and the European Reformation. After assuming power, the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a Swedish translation of the Bible. The New Testament came out in 1526, followed by a full Bible translation in 1541, usually referred to as the \"Gustav Vasa Bible\", a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were Laurentius Andreæ and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri.\n\nThe Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new; while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms. It was a major step towards a more consistent Swedish orthography. It established the use of the vowels \"å\", \"ä\", and \"ö\", and the spelling \"ck\" in place of \"kk\", distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible, perhaps intentionally due to the ongoing rivalry between the countries. All three translators came from central Sweden which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible.\n\nThough it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.\n\nCapitalization was during this time not standardized. It depended on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized, due to the Gothic or black letter font which was used to print the Bible. This font was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin font (often antiqua).\n\nSome important changes in sound during the Modern Swedish period were the gradual assimilation of several different consonant clusters into and the softening of /g/ and /k/ into /ʝ/ and before front vowels. The dental and velar fricatives and were transformed to the corresponding plosives /d/ and /g/.\n\nThe period that includes Swedish as it is spoken today is termed \"nusvenska\" (\"Contemporary Swedish\", lit. \"Now-Swedish\") in linguistic terminology. With the industrialization and urbanization of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century, a new breed of authors made their mark on Swedish literature. Many authors, scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the new national language that was emerging, the most influential of these being August Strindberg (1849–1912).\n\nIt was during the 20th century that a common, standardized national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, with the exception of some minor deviations, by the time of the spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish spoken today. The plural verb forms remained, in ever decreasing use, in formal (and particularly written) language until the 1950s, when they were finally officially abolished even from all official recommendations.\n\nA very significant change in Swedish occurred in the 1960s, with the so-called \"du-reformen\", \"the you-reform\". Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. The use of \"herr\" (\"mr\"), \"fru\" (\"mrs\") or \"fröken\" (\"miss\") was only considered acceptable in initial conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society. In the early 20th century, an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with \"Ni\" (the standard second person plural pronoun)corresponding to \"vous\" in French and \"Sie\" in German. \"Ni\" wound up being used as a slightly less arrogant form of \"du\" used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 60s, these previously significant distinctions of class became less important and \"du\" became the standard, even in formal and official contexts.\n\nFormerly, there were Swedish-speaking communities in Estonia, particularly on the islands (Hiiumaa, Saaremaa and Vormsi) along the coast of the Baltic. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of the Baltic territories to Russia in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Swedish speakers were forced to march to Ukraine, where they founded a village, \"Gammalsvenskby\" (\"Old Swedish Village\"), north of the Crimea. A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.\n\nIn Estonia, the small remaining Swedish community was very well treated between the First and Second World Wars.

{"id": "39677049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39677049", "title": "Internal–external distinction", "text": "Internal–external distinction\n\nThe internal–external distinction is a distinction used in philosophy to divide an ontology into two parts: an internal part consisting of a linguistic framework and observations related to that framework, and an external part concerning practical questions about the utility of that framework. This division was introduced by Rudolf Carnap in his work \"Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology\". It was subsequently criticized at length by Willard Van Orman Quine in a number of works, and was considered for some time to have been discredited. However, recently a number of authors have come to the support of some or another version of Carnap's approach.\n\nCarnap introduced the idea of a 'linguistic framework' or a 'form of language' that uses a precise specification of the definitions of and the relations between entities. The discussion of a proposition within a framework can take on a logical or an empirical (that is, factual) aspect. The logical aspect concerns whether the proposition respects the definitions and rules set up in the framework. The empirical aspect concerns the application of the framework in some or another practical situation.\n\nThe utility of a linguistic framework constitutes issues that Carnap calls 'external' or 'pragmatic'.\n\nThe distinction between 'internal' and 'external' arguments is not as obvious as it might appear. For example, discussion of the imaginary unit \"might\" be an internal question framed in the language of complex numbers about the correct usage of , or it be a question about the utility of complex numbers: whether there is any practical advantage in using . Clearly the question of utility is not completely separable from the way a linguistic framework is organized. A more formal statement of the internal-external difference is provided by Myhill:\nQuine disputed Carnap's position from several points of view. His most famous criticism of Carnap was \"Two dogmas of empiricism\", but this work is not directed at the internal-external distinction but at the analytic-synthetic distinction brought up by Carnap in his work on logic: \"Meaning and Necessity\". Quine's criticism of the internal-external distinction is found in his works \"On Carnap's views on Ontology\" and \"Word and Object\".\n\nQuine's approach to the internal-external division was to cast internal questions as \"subclass\" questions and external questions as \"category\" questions. What Quine meant by 'subclass' questions were questions like \"what are so-and-so's?\" where the answers are restricted to lie within a specific linguistic framework. On the other hand, 'category' questions were questions like \"what are so-and-so's?\" asked outside any specific language where the answers are not so-restricted. The term \"subclass\" arises as follows: Quine supposes that a particular linguistic framework selects from a broad \"category\" of meanings for a term, say \"furniture\", a particular or subclass of meanings, say \"chairs\".\n\nQuine argued that there is always possible an overarching language that encompasses both types of question and the distinction between the two types is artificial.\nSo we can switch back and forth from internal to external questions just by a shift of vocabulary. As Thomasson puts it, if our language refers to 'things' we can ask of all the \"things\" there are, are any of them \"numbers\"; while if our language includes only 'numbers', we can ask only narrower questions like whether any \"numbers\" are \"prime numbers\". In other words, Quine's position is that \"Carnap's main objection to metaphysics rests on an unsupported premise, namely the assumption that there is some sort of principled plurality in language which blocks Quine's move to homogenize the existential quantifier.\" \"What is to stop us treating all ontological issues as internal questions within a single grand framework?\"\n\nA view close to Quine’s subclass/category description is called ‘’conceptual relativity’’. To describe conceptual relativity, Putnam points out that while the pages of a book are regarded as part of book when they are attached, they are things-in-themselves if they are detached. My nose is only part of an object, my person. On the other hand, is my nose the same as the collection of atoms or molecules forming it? This arbitrariness of language is called conceptual relativity, a matter of conventions. The point is made that if one wishes to refer only to 'pages', then books may not exist, and \"vice versa\" if one wishes to admit only to books. Thus, in this view, the Carnapian multiplicity of possible linguistic frameworks proposes a variety of 'realities' and the prospect of choosing between them, a form of what is called ontological pluralism, or multiple realities. The notion of 'one reality' behind our everyday perceptions is common in everyday life, and some find it unsettling that what 'exists' might be a matter of what language one chooses to use. This belief, however, is rendered somewhat plastic by the fact that we cannot see this underlying 'reality' directly, raising a philosophical issue called the subject–object problem.\n\nA related idea is quantifier variance. Loosely speaking a 'quantifier expression' is just a function that says \"there exists at least one such-and-such\". Then 'quantifier variance' combines the notion that the same object can have different names, so the quantifier may refer to the same thing even though different names are employed by it, and the notion that quantifier expressions can be formed in a variety of ways. Hirsch says this arbitrariness over what 'exists' is a quandary only due to Putnam's formulation, and it is resolved by turning things upside down and saying things that exist can have different names. In other words, Hirsch agrees with Quine that there is an overarching language that we can adapt to different situations. The Carnapian internal/external distinction in this view, as with the subclass/category distinction, is just a matter of language, and has nothing to do with 'reality'.\n\nMore recently, some philosophers have stressed that the real issue is not one of language as such, but the difference between questions asked \"using\" a linguistic framework and those asked somehow before the adoption of a linguistic framework, the difference between questions about the construction and rules of a framework, and questions about the decision whether to use a framework. This distinction is called by Thomasson and Price the difference between ‘’using’’ a term and ‘’mentioning’’ a term. As Price notes, Carnap holds that there is a mistake involved in \"assimilating issues of the existence of numbers (say) and of the existence of physical objects...the distinctions in question are not grounded at the syntactical level.\" Price suggests a connection with Ryle's view of different functions of language:\nAlthough not supporting an entire lack of distinction like the subclass/category view of Quine, as a \"pragmatic\" issue, the use/mention distinction still does not provide a sharp division between the issues of forming and conceptualizing a framework and deciding whether to adopt it: each informs the other. An example is the well-known tension between mathematicians and physicists, the one group very concerned over questions of logic and rigor, and the other inclined to sacrifice a bit of rigor to explain observations.\n\nOne approach to selecting a framework is based upon an examination of the conceptual relations between entities in a framework, which entities are more 'fundamental'. One framework may then 'include' another because the entities in one framework apparently can be derived from or 'supervene' upon those in the more fundamental one. While Carnap claims such decisions are pragmatic in nature, external questions with no philosophical importance, Schaffer suggests we avoid this formulation. Instead, we should go back to Aristotle and look upon nature as hierarchical, and pursue philosophical \"diagnostics\": that is, examination of criteria for what is fundamental and what relations exist between all entities and these fundamental ones. But \"how can we discover what grounds what?...questions regarding not only what grounds what, but also what the grounding consists in, and how one may discover or discern grounding facts, seem to be part of an emerging set of relational research problems in metaphysics.\"\n\n"}

His stories are best known for such themes as murder, rape, and cannibalism.\n\nHe was born on March 10, 1878, in Rzhyshchiv, Ukraine. In 1896, he traveled to Warsaw, struggled to work for two years, then returned to Ukraine. He experienced a pogrom, fell in love and attempted suicide, and was later conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army. These experiences would influence much of his rather dark, fictional themes. Shapiro returned to Warsaw in 1903, and I. L. Peretz helped him publish his first literary works: \"Di Fligl\" (\"The Wings\"); and, the next year, a longer story called \"Itsikl Mamzer\" (\"Little Isaac the Bastard\"), published in a journal edited by Avrom Reyzen. To Peretz he would dedicate one of his works, \"Smoke\", a tale of the Old World (Peretz would serve as an early benefactor of another famous Yiddish writer, Der Nister).\n\nShapiro left for America in 1905. He stayed for a year in London, where he befriended the Hebrew writer Yosef Haim Brenner. After arriving in New York in 1906, and working for \"The Forward\", he began publishing his gruesome pogrom tales: \"The Kiss\" (1907); \"Pour Out Thy Wrath\" (1908); \"The Cross\" (1909); \"In The Dead Town\" (1910). Shapiro's work marks a break from that of the three classic Yiddish writers in its foregrounding of violence and psychological realism, rather than satirical commentary. Shapiro subsequently returned to Warsaw for a year, then returned permanently to the United States in 1911. By 1919, Shapiro had written what are considered his two greatest pogrom stories: \"White Challah\" and \"The Jewish Government.\" The two stories \"remain some of the most aesthetically nuanced and psychologically complex treatments of the pogrom theme in modern Jewish literature.\"\n\nShapiro and his family moved to Los Angeles in 1921. His wife, Freydl, died there in 1927, and he then returned to New York. Back in New York yet again, Shapiro worked at several literary periodicals, was active in the Communist party, and was employed by the Federal Writers' Project in 1937. Shapiro returned to LA in 1939, where he lived at 544 Heliotrope Drive in East Hollywood.\n\nShapiro died in Los Angeles in 1948 while living in a friend's garage. He died an alcoholic and poor. He was buried at the Mount Zion Cemetery in East Los Angeles next to his wife and his tombstone was inscribed with the words: \"Lamed Levi Shapiro, Author of the Yiddishe Melukhe\".\n\n\nIn English translation\n\nCurt Leviant, noted translator of Yiddish literature and a novelist in his own right, wrote his MA thesis on Shapiro: “Lamed Shapiro: Master Craftsman of the Yiddish Short Stories”, Columbia University, 1957.\n\nDavid G.

She was the president of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.\n\nMorley was born on 20 February 1899 in Halifax, Yorkshire. She was the eldest daughter of Samuel Edwin Morley and Helen Ann Monk (née Fletcher). Morley attended high schools in Halifax and Monkseaton and went on to read physics and biology at Armstrong College, a college of Durham University located in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1920 she graduated with a BSc and a certificate of education. She taught physics at the Church High School in Newcastle for ten years before taking up a teaching post in India. Whilst working in India, Morley contracted dysentery and upon her return to England she was advised that she was no longer strong enough for work in the classroom.\n\nIn 1932, after working as a secretary due to her forced change of career, Morley responded to an advertisement placed by William Wardell, a plastic surgeon located in Newcastle upon Tyne. Wardell had developed a new type of pharyngoplasty for children with cleft palate and wanted an \"educated woman\" to assess the speech skills of the children before and after surgery, to help determine the effectiveness of the operation. Through this work, Morley began specialising as a speech therapist working with cleft palate patients. She subsequently trained formally as a speech therapist by working with colleagues in Liverpool and London in hospitals and school clinics. In 1938 she gained the diploma of the British Society of Speech Therapists.\n\nMorley was appointed as a therapist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. Whilst working for two sessions a week, she spent time preparing a thesis on cleft palate, which later became the basis for her book \"Cleft Palate and Speech\", passed in April 1939. It is around this time that she also gained membership of the British Society of Speech Therapists; its members were admitted to the College of Speech Therapists founded in 1945.\n\nMorley's book gave thorough descriptions of the anatomy of cleft palate, surgery, associated speech problems and practical suggestions for treatment. It became a source of standard work in this field when published in 1945.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1945 people were becoming increasingly aware of speech therapy and the profession gained more recognition. By 1945 Morley had set up Newcastle's hospital speech therapy service and was now working full-time as a therapist in three different hospitals. Her treatment covered a variety of speech, language and communication disorders including aphasic ex-servicemen suffering from head injuries sustained in World War II. As Morley's practice expanded, she was obliged to involve parents in the treatment of their child's speech and language disorder to manager her bulging caseload. However, soon she recognised the benefits of this and became an exponent of parental involvement in speech therapy.\n\nOne of her major studies, with colleagues in Child Health, Neurology and Statistics was conducted between 1950 and 1953. During this time, Morley's department researched into the normal and abnormal development of speech in a group of over 1000 children at ages 2,4,6 and 15 as part of the Newcastle Thousand Families survey. In 1957 she published part of this study together with examples of her work in multidisciplinary clinics as The Development and Disorders of Speech in Childhood. This work was regarded as a landmark in speech pathology in the United States of America. In 1958, on the basis of this book, Morley was awarded the degree of DSc by the University of Durham.\n\nMorley made her first of several visits to the USA in 1951 where she found the standard of clinical work was below that of the UK, but that academically the training was more extensive. Upon her return to the UK, Morley hoped that a university degree course might persuade more people into the profession. Eventually, she persuaded the university in Newcastle, still then part of the University of Durham, to investigate the possibility of setting up a degree. In 1959, Morley's idea was realised and she delayed her retirement in order to establish the course. She was appointed lecturer in speech and speech pathology in the departments of child health and education, founding head of what became the first department of Speech in Britain.\n\nMorley joined the ultimately successful campaign against registration under the Bill for Professions Supplementary to Medicine because she was convinced that the profession, in order to survive, must exist as a discipline completely separate from general medicine. A national referendum of speech therapists followed, the profession stood firm and, despite government anger, they were removed from the Bill. The Professions Supplementary to Medicine Bill was enacted in 1960.\n\nMorley's contribution to the profession of speech therapy was considerable. She eventually retired from what was by then the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, however in retirement she became the founding editor of the College of Speech Therapists' \"journal\" from 1966 - 1971, then known as the \"British Journal of Disorders of Communication\". Morley served as its third president from 1971–1973. Throughout her career, she forged strong links with speech therapy profession in the USA, Australia and New Zealand where she travelled widely as a visiting professor. She was involved in achieving reciprocal recognition of speech therapy qualifications in the USA and was made an honorary member of the American Cleft Palate Association and honorary fellow of the Australian College of Speech Therapists.\n\nIn 1980, Morley was appointed OBE in acknowledgement of her pioneering work in research and education in speech therapy. Donald Court, professor of child health at Newcastle and her former colleague, described Morley in 1984 as a \"remarkable woman\", likening her to Cromwell's soldiers, \"she knew what she fought for and loved what she knew\".\n\nDuring her retirement, Morley lived in Northumberland where she enjoyed the last thirty years of her life.

It is used in the automotive, computer, and culinary industries. In cars, on the fly can be used to describe the changing of the cars configuration while it is still driving. Processes that can occur while the car is still driving include switching between two wheel drive and four wheel drive on some cars and opening and closing the roof on some convertible cars. In computing, on the fly CD writers can read from one CD and write the data to another without saving it on a computer's memory. Switching programs or applications on the fly in multi-tasking operating systems means the ability to switch between native and/or emulated programs or applications that are still running and running in parallel while performing their tasks or processes, but without pausing, freezing, or delaying any, or other unwanted events. Switching computer parts on the fly means computer parts are replaced while the computer is still running. It can also be used in programming to describe changing a program while it is still running. In restaurants and other places involved in the preparation of food, the term is used to indicate that an order needs to be made right away.\n\nIn colloquial use, \"on the fly\" means something created when needed. The phrase is used to mean:\n\nIn the automotive industry, the term refers to the circumstance of performing certain operations while a vehicle is driven by the engine and moving. In reference to four-wheel drive vehicles, this term describes the ability to change from two to four-wheel drive while the car is in gear and moving. In some convertible models, the roof can be folded electrically on the fly, whereas in other cases the car must be stopped.\nIn harvesting machines, newer monitoring systems let the driver track the quality of the grain, while enabling them to adjust the rotor speed on the fly as harvesting progresses.\n\nIn multitasking computing an operating system can handle several programs, both native applications or emulated software, that are running independent, parallel, together in the same time in the same device, using separated or shared resources and/or data, executing their tasks separately or together, while a user can switch on the fly between them or groups of them to use obtained effects or supervise purposes, without waste of time or waste of performance. In operating systems using GUI very often it is done by switching from an active window (or an object playing similar role) of a particular software piece to another one but of another software. \n\nA computer can compute results on the fly, or retrieve a previously stored result.\n\nIt can mean to make a copy of a removable media (CD-ROM, DVD, etc.) directly, without first saving the source on an intermediate medium (a harddisk); for example, copying a CD-ROM from a CD-ROM drive to a CD-Writer drive. The copy process requires each block of data to be retrieved and immediately written to the destination, so that there is room in the working memory to retrieve the next block of data.\n\nWhen used for encrypted data storage, \"on the fly\" the data stream is automatically encrypted as it is written and decrypted when read back again, transparently to software. The acronym OTFE is typically used. \n\nOn-the-fly programming is the technique of modifying a program without stopping it.\n\nA similar concept, hot swapping, refers to on-the-fly replacement of computer hardware.\n\nOn-the-fly computing (OTF computing) is about automating and customizing software tailored to the needs of a user. According to a requirement specification, this software is composed of basic components, so-called basic services, and a user-specific setting of these basic components is made. Accordingly, the requested services are compiled only at the request of the user and then run in a specially designed data center to make the user the functions of the (on-the-fly) created service accessible.\n\nIn restaurants, cafes, banquet halls, and other places involved in the preparation of food, the term is used to indicate that an order needs to be made right away.

{"id": "355363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355363", "title": "Proclamation of the Irish Republic", "text": "Proclamation of the Irish Republic\n\nThe Proclamation of the Republic (), also known as the 1916 Proclamation or the Easter Proclamation, was a document issued by the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army during the Easter Rising in Ireland, which began on 24 April 1916. In it, the Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, styling itself the \"Provisional Government of the Irish Republic\", proclaimed Ireland's independence from the United Kingdom. The reading of the proclamation by Patrick Pearse outside the General Post Office (GPO) on Sackville Street (now called O'Connell Street), Dublin's main thoroughfare, marked the beginning of the Rising. The proclamation was modelled on a similar independence proclamation issued during the 1803 rebellion by Robert Emmet.\n\nThough the Rising failed in military terms, the principles of the Proclamation to varying degrees influenced the thinking of later generations of Irish politicians. The document consisted of a number of assertions:\n\n\nThe proclamation had been printed secretly prior to the Rising on a Summit Wharfedale Stop Cylinder Press, located in Liberty Hall, Eden Quay (HQ of the Irish Citizen Army). Because of its secret printing, problems arose which affected the layout and design. In particular, because of a shortage of type, the document was printed in two halves, printing first the top then the bottom on the same pieces of paper. The typesetters were Willie O'Brien, Michael Molloy and Christopher Brady. They lacked a sufficient supply of type in the same size and font, and as a result the some parts of the document use \"e\"s from a different font, which are smaller and do not quite match.\n\nThe language suggested that the original copy of the proclamation had actually been signed by the Rising's leaders. However no evidence has ever been found, nor do any contemporary records mention, the existence of an \"actually signed\" copy, though had such a copy existed, it could easily have been destroyed in the aftermath of the Rising by someone (in the British military, a member of the public or a Rising participant trying to destroy potentially incriminating evidence) who did not appreciate its historic importance. Molloy claimed in later life to have set the document from a handwritten copy, with signatures on a separate piece of paper which he destroyed by chewing while in prison, but this was disputed by other participants. Molloy also recalled that Connolly had asked for the document to resemble an auctioneer's notice in general design.\n\nThere are about 30 original copies still remaining, one of which can be viewed in the National Print Museum. Reproductions were later made, which have sometimes been misattributed as originals. When the British soldiers recaptured Liberty Hall, they found the press with the type of the bottom of the proclamation still fully set up, and reportedly ran off some copies as souvenirs, leading to a proliferation of these 'half-copies'. James Mosley notes that complete originals rapidly became rare in the chaos, and that over a month later the Dublin police had failed to find one for their files.\n\nThe signatories (as their names appeared on the Proclamation):\n\nOne question sometimes raised is why the first name among the 'signatories' was not Pearse but Tom Clarke, a veteran republican. Had the arrangement of names been alphabetical, Éamonn Ceannt would have appeared on top. Clarke's widow maintained that it was because the plan had been for Clarke, as a famed veteran, to become the \"President of the Provisional Republic\". Such an explanation would certainly explain his premier position. However others associated with the Rising dismissed her claims, which she made in her memoirs. Later documents issued by the rebels gave Pearse pride of place, though as 'Commanding in Chief the Forces of the Irish Republic, and President of the Provisional Government, not 'President of the Republic'. Whether the plan had ever been to have Clarke as a symbolic head of state and Pearse as head of government, or was simply that Pearse was always to be central but with statements ambiguously describing his title, remains a mystery about which historians still speculate.\n\nAll seven signatories of the proclamation were executed by the British military (James Connolly who had been wounded in the fighting was executed sitting down in a chair) in the aftermath of the Rising, being viewed as having committed treason in wartime (i.e. the First World War). British political leaders regarded the executions initially as unwise, later as a catastrophe, with the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and later prime minister David Lloyd George stating that they regretted allowing the British military to treat the matter as a matter of military law in wartime, rather than insisting that the leaders were treated under civilian criminal law. Though initially deeply unsympathetic to the Rising (the leading Irish nationalist newspaper, the \"Irish Independent\" called for their execution), Irish public opinion switched and became more sympathetic due to manner of their treatment and executions. Eventually Asquith's government ordered a halt to the executions and insisted that those not already executed be dealt with through civilian, not military, law. By that stage all the signatories and a number of others had been executed.\n\nFull copies of the Easter Proclamation are now treated as a revered Irish national icon, and a copy was sold at auction for €390,000 in December, 2004. A copy owned (and later signed as a memento) by Rising participant Seán T. O'Kelly was presented by him to the Irish parliament buildings, Leinster House, during his tenure as President of Ireland. It is currently on permanent display in the main foyer. Other copies are on display in the GPO (headquarters of the Rising and the place where the Proclamation was first read), the National Museum of Ireland, the Trinity College Library's Long Room and other museums worldwide. Facsimile copies are sold as souvenirs in Ireland, and copies of the text are often displayed in Irish schools and in Irish pubs throughout the world. The proclamation is read aloud by an Officer of the Irish Defence Forces outside the GPO during the Easter Rising commemorations on Easter Sunday of each year.\n\nPOBLACHT NA hÉIREANN<br>\nTHE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT\nOF THE\nIRISH REPUBLIC\nTO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND\n\nIRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN:<br> In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.\n\nHaving organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that moment, and supported by her exiled children in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.\n\nWe declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the past three hundred years they have asserted it in arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades in arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.\n\nThe Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien Government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.\n\nUntil our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent National Government, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.\n\nWe place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God, Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, inhumanity, or rapine. In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline, and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "360030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360030", "title": "Question answering", "text": "Question answering\n\nQuestion answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.\n\nA QA implementation, usually a computer program, may construct its answers by querying a structured database of knowledge or information, usually a knowledge base. More commonly, QA systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents.\n\nSome examples of natural language document collections used for QA systems include:\n\n\nQA research attempts to deal with a wide range of question types including: fact, list, definition, \"How\", \"Why\", hypothetical, semantically constrained, and cross-lingual questions.\n\n\nTwo early QA systems were BASEBALL and LUNAR. BASEBALL answered questions about the US baseball league over a period of one year. LUNAR, in turn, answered questions about the geological analysis of rocks returned by the Apollo moon missions. Both QA systems were very effective in their chosen domains. In fact, LUNAR was demonstrated at a lunar science convention in 1971 and it was able to answer 90% of the questions in its domain posed by people untrained on the system. Further restricted-domain QA systems were developed in the following years. The common feature of all these systems is that they had a core database or knowledge system that was hand-written by experts of the chosen domain. The language abilities of BASEBALL and LUNAR used techniques similar to ELIZA and DOCTOR, the first chatterbot programs.\n\nSHRDLU was a highly successful question-answering program developed by Terry Winograd in the late 60s and early 70s. It simulated the operation of a robot in a toy world (the \"blocks world\"), and it offered the possibility of asking the robot questions about the state of the world. Again, the strength of this system was the choice of a very specific domain and a very simple world with rules of physics that were easy to encode in a computer program.\n\nIn the 1970s, knowledge bases were developed that targeted narrower domains of knowledge. The QA systems developed to interface with these expert systems produced more repeatable and valid responses to questions within an area of knowledge. These expert systems closely resembled modern QA systems except in their internal architecture. Expert systems rely heavily on expert-constructed and organized knowledge bases, whereas many modern QA systems rely on statistical processing of a large, unstructured, natural language text corpus.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the development of comprehensive theories in computational linguistics, which led to the development of ambitious projects in text comprehension and question answering. One example of such a system was the Unix Consultant (UC), developed by Robert Wilensky at U.C. Berkeley in the late 1980s. The system answered questions pertaining to the Unix operating system. It had a comprehensive hand-crafted knowledge base of its domain, and it aimed at phrasing the answer to accommodate various types of users. Another project was LILOG, a text-understanding system that operated on the domain of tourism information in a German city. The systems developed in the UC and LILOG projects never went past the stage of simple demonstrations, but they helped the development of theories on computational linguistics and reasoning.\n\nRecently, specialized natural language QA systems have been developed, such as EAGLi for health and life scientists.\n\nAs of 2001, QA systems typically included a \"question classifier\" module that determines the type of question and the type of answer. A \"multiagent\" question-answering architecture has been proposed, where each domain is represented by an agent which tries to answer questions taking into account its specific knowledge; a meta–agent controls the cooperation between question answering agents and chooses the most relevant answer(s).\n\nQA is very dependent on a good search corpus - for without documents containing the answer, there is little any QA system can do. It thus makes sense that larger collection sizes generally lend well to better QA performance, unless the question domain is orthogonal to the collection. The notion of data redundancy in massive collections, such as the web, means that nuggets of information are likely to be phrased in many different ways in differing contexts and documents, leading to two benefits:\n\n\nSome question answering systems rely heavily on automated reasoning. There are a number of question answering systems designed in Prolog, a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence.\n\nIn information retrieval, an open domain question answering system aims at returning an answer in response to the user's question. The returned answer is in the form of short texts rather than a list of relevant documents. The system uses a combination of techniques from computational linguistics, information retrieval and knowledge representation for finding answers.\n\nThe system takes a natural language question as an input rather than a set of keywords, for example, \"When is the national day of China?\" The sentence is then transformed into a query through its logical form. Having the input in the form of a natural language question makes the system more user-friendly, but harder to implement, as there are various question types and the system will have to identify the correct one in order to give a sensible answer. Assigning a question type to the question is a crucial task, the entire answer extraction process relies on finding the correct question type and hence the correct answer type.\n\nKeyword extraction is the first step for identifying the input question type. In some cases, there are clear words that indicate the question type directly. i.e. \"Who\", \"Where\" or \"How many\", these words tell the system that the answers should be of type \"Person\", \"Location\", \"Number\" respectively. In the example above, the word \"When\" indicates that the answer should be of type \"Date\". POS (Part of Speech) tagging and syntactic parsing techniques can also be used to determine the answer type. In this case, the subject is \"Chinese National Day\", the predicate is \"is\" and the adverbial modifier is \"when\", therefore the answer type is \"Date\". Unfortunately, some interrogative words like \"Which\", \"What\" or \"How\" do not give clear answer types. Each of these words can represent more than one type. In situations like this, other words in the question need to be considered. First thing to do is to find the words that can indicate the meaning of the question. A lexical dictionary such as WordNet can then be used for understanding the context.\n\nOnce the question type has been identified, an Information retrieval system is used to find a set of documents containing the correct key words. A tagger and NP/Verb Group chunker can be used to verify whether the correct entities and relations are mentioned in the found documents. For questions such as \"Who\" or \"Where\", a Named Entity Recogniser is used to find relevant \"Person\" and \"Location\" names from the retrieved documents. Only the relevant paragraphs are selected for ranking.\n\nA vector space model can be used as a strategy for classifying the candidate answers. Check if the answer is of the correct type as determined in the question type analysis stage. Inference technique can also be used to validate the candidate answers. A score is then given to each of these candidates according to the number of question words it contains and how close these words are to the candidate, the more and the closer the better. The answer is then translated into a compact and meaningful representation by parsing. In the previous example, the expected output answer is \"1st Oct.\"\n\nIn 2002, a group of researchers presented an unpublished and largely unsourced report as a funding support document, in which they describe a 5-year roadmap of research current to the state of the question answering field at that time.\n\nQA systems have been extended in recent years to encompass additional domains of knowledge For example, systems have been developed to automatically answer temporal and geospatial questions, questions of definition and terminology, biographical questions, multilingual questions, and questions about the content of audio, images, and video. Current QA research topics include:\n\n\nIBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.\n\nFacebook Research has made their DrQA system available under an open source license. This system has been used for open domain question answering using Wikipedia as knowledge source.\n\n\n"}

It is usually a heavy fibreglass or iron curtain located immediately behind the proscenium arch. Asbestos-based materials were originally used to manufacture the curtain, before the dangers of asbestos were widely publicized. The safety curtain is sometimes referred to as an iron in British theatres, regardless of the actual construction material.\n\nOccupational safety and health regulations state that the safety curtain must be able to resist fire and thereby prevent (or at least hinder) fires starting on stage from spreading to the auditorium and the rest of the theatre, reducing injuries to audience members and members of staff.\n\nThe curtain is extremely heavy and therefore requires its own dedicated operating mechanisms. In an emergency, the stage manager can usually pull a lever backstage which will cause the curtain to fall rapidly into position. Alternatively, heat-sensitive components can be built into the rigging to automatically close this curtain in case of fire. Finally, it may be released electronically by a building's fire control system if any alarm box is operated. It can also be flown in and out, as regulations in some jurisdictions state that it must be shown to the audience, to prove its effective operation, for a certain amount of time during every performance. This usually occurs during the intermission.\n\nIn smaller theatres, a safety curtain is not usually required. Specifically, most United States building codes only require a fire curtain in theatres with a stage height of more than . The heavy, flame-retardant house tabs can provide some degree of fire separation.\n\nIn the UK, it is a requirement that a safety curtain must be fully down within the proscenium opening within 30 seconds of being released. In 1794 the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane became the first theatre to feature an iron safety curtain. Several other serious fires, notably that at the Theatre Royal, Exeter in 1887, led to the introduction of safety curtains on a wider scale.\n\nChicago's 1903 Iroquois Theatre fire resulted in over 600 deaths when the theater's safety curtain got stuck midway down, along with other structural deficiencies in the building.\n\nThe safety curtain can be combined with other safety devices, such as:\n\n\nIn the event of a fire, the use of smoke doors and fire curtains means that the stage area effectively functions as a chimney. The heated air rises and leaves through the smoke doors, and this puts the building into negative pressure, which in turn draws fresh air in through any open exit doors. Patrons waiting to exit will have fresh breathing air until the exit doors close. The exit doors which open out will be drawn closed tightly by this draft once they are no longer held open by evacuees. Once the doors are closed, the fire loses its oxygen source. If the doors are then opened again, a backdraft can occur.\n\n"}

As a screenwriter, he wrote the screenplays, stories and scripts for numerous Bollywood films. In Hindi cinema, Khan is best known for being one half of the prolific screenwriting duo of Salim-Javed, along with Javed Akhtar. The duo Salim-Javed were the first Indian screenwriters to achieve star status, becoming the most successful Indian screenwriters of all time, and are regarded as \"Hindi cinema's greatest screenwriters\". While working together, Salim Khan was largely responsible for developing the stories and characters, while Javed Akhtar was largely responsible for developing the dialogues.\n\nSalim-Javed revolutionized Indian cinema in the 1970s, transforming and reinventing the Bollywood formula, pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format, and pioneering genres such as the masala film and the Dacoit Western. Salim Khan was also responsible for creating the \"angry young man\" character archetype and launching Amitabh Bachchan's career. Their films are among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time, including \"Sholay\" (1975), the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time, as well as films such as \"Seeta Aur Geeta\" (1972), \"Zanjeer\" (1973), \"Deewaar\" (1975), \"Kranti\" (1981), and the \"Don\" franchise. \"Sholay\" is also considered to be one of the greatest Indian films of all time.\n\nKhan is also known as the founder of the Salim Khan family, as the father of three Bollywood actors, Salman Khan (one of the big three Khans of Bollywood), Sohail Khan, and Arbaaz Khan, and film producer Alvira Khan Agnihotri. He is married to Sushila Charak (a.k.a. Salma Khan) and to actress Helen Richardson Khan. Salim Khan won six Filmfare Awards as part of Salim-Javed, and he was later awarded the Padma Shri in 2014.\n\nSalim Khan was born in the city of Indore in Indore State a princely state in British India (modern day Madhya Pradesh, India) into an affluent family. Khan's grandfather, Anwar Khan, was an Alakozai Pashtun who migrated from British madras]] to India in the mid-1800s and served in the cavalry of the British Indian Army.. Khan's family tended to look for employment in government service, and eventually settled in Indore.\n\nSalim Khan was the youngest child of his parents, both of whom died by the time he was 14 years old. His father, Abdul Rashid Khan, had joined the Indian Imperial Police and had risen to the rank of DIG-Indore, which was the highest police rank open to an Indian in British India. Salim's mother died when he was only nine years old. She had suffered from tuberculosis for four years before her death, and therefore it was forbidden for the younger children come close to her or hug her; Salim therefore had little contact with his mother even before her early death. His father also died in January 1950, when he was only fourteen years old. Two months later, in March 1950, Salim (who attended St. Raphaels' School in Indore) appeared for his matriculation examination. He did moderately well, and enrolled in Holkar College, Indore, and completed his BA. His elder brothers supported him with funds drawn from the family's substantial wealth, to the extent that he was given a car of his own while he was a college student. He excelled in sports, especially cricket, and it was for being a star cricketer that he was allowed by the college to enroll for a master's degree at the end of his bachelors. He was also a trained pilot. During these years, he also became enamored of films, and received encouragement from classmates, who told him that with his exceptional good looks, he should try to become a film star.\n\nWhile he was an MA student in Indore, Salim attended the wedding of Kamal Barjatya, son of film producer Tarachand Barjatya (founder of Rajshri Productions). Here, he was spotted by film director K. Amarnath, who was impressed by his good looks and offered him a supporting role in his forthcoming film \"Baraat\". He would be paid Rs.1000/- as a signing amount and a monthly salary of Rs.400/- for the period of shooting. Salim accepted and moved to Mumbai, living in a small rented apartment in Mahim. While \"Baraat\" was duly made and released in 1960, it did not do too well, and in any case, his role was a minor one.\n\nWorking under the name Prince Salim, he got into the usual 'struggle' situation of wannabe actors, working in minor roles, being typecast as a good-looking supporting actor, and gradually descending into B-grade films. Over the next decade, he acted in what he calls “indifferent roles,\" playing minor characters in about two dozen films, but so minor were his appearances that his name does not appear on the credits of several of these films; his credits amount to a total of 14 films till 1970, and one final appearance in 1977. These included \"Teesri Manzil\" (1966), \"Sarhaadi Lootera\" (1966) and \"Diwaana\" (1967). His most substantial role, for which he did receive some notice, was in \"Teesri Manzil\", where his role as the hero's friend was a meaty one, and his entry scene got a very good build-up.\n\nAfter working in 25 films, he eventually understood that he \"was not cut out to be an actor because I lacked the art of projection. But by then it was too late — how could I have gone back to Indore?\" In the late 1960s, Salim Khan, who was struggling financially, decided to start shifting his focus away from acting and towards writing scripts, and continued to use the name Prince Salim. One of his more notable film scripts was \"Do Bhai\" (1969). He also began working with Abrar Alvi as a writing assistant.\n\nSalim met Javed Akhthar for first time during the making of the film \"Sarhadi Lootera,\" which was to be Salim's last acting appearance. Javed, who served as a clapper boy when shooting began, was later made the dialogue writer for the film by director S.M. Sagar. Their friendship began while both were working in this film, and developed further because their bosses were neighbours to each other. Salim Khan got a job assisting writer/director Abrar Alvi in finalizing screenplays and dialogues, while Javed Akhtar began assisting Kaifi Azmi in a similar capacity, with focus on honing poetry. Abrar Alvi and Kaifi Azmi were neighbours, and therefor Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar used to see a lot of each other. The duo hit it off well and formed a script-writing team that came to be known as Salim-Javed. Salim used to form stories and plots, whereas Javed used to develop the dialogues and occasionally the song-lyrics for those films. They used to brainstorm and come to conclusions regarding the final draft of the film.\n\nRajesh Khanna is credited with giving them their first break as script writers. Javed Akhtar accepted in an interview that \"One day, he (Rajesh Khanna) went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow Aashirwad. But the film was a remake and the script of the original was far from being satisfactory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit.\" This was their first break as script-writers, and the film, \"Haathi Mere Saathi,\" went on to become a big hit.\nThe Salim-Javed duo were hired by G. P. Sippy to work for Sippy Films as resident screenwriters. They produced the screenplays for several successful films like Andaz, Seeta Aur Geeta, Sholay and Don. Their first big success was the script for \"Andaz\", followed by Adhikar (1971), \"Haathi Mere Saathi\" and \"Seeta Aur Geeta\" (1972). They also had hits in \"Yaadon Ki Baaraat\" (1973), \"Zanjeer\" (1973), Haath Ki Safai (1974), \"Deewaar\" (1975), \"Sholay\" (1975), Chacha Bhatija (1977), Don (1978), \"Trishul\" (1978), Dostana (1980), \"Kranti\" (1981), \"Zamana\" (1985) and \"Mr. India\" (1987). They have worked together in 24 films including two Kannada films – Premada Kanike and Raja Nanna Raja. Of the 24 films they wrote 20 were hits. The scripts they wrote but which were not successful at box office include Aakhri Dao (1975), Immaan Dharam (1977), Kaala Patthar (1979) and Shaan (1980). Though they split in 1982, due to ego issues, some of the scripts they wrote were made into films later like \"Zamana\" and \"Mr. India\" which became successful. Salim-Javed, many a time described as \"the most successful scriptwriters of all-time\", are also noted to be the first scriptwriters in Indian cinema to achieve star status.\n\nThe Salim-Javed duo were also notable for causing several changed to be made in the way scriptwriters were perceived and treated within the Hindi film industry. Until the 1970s, there was no concept of having the same people write screenplay, story and dialogue. Nor were writers usually named in the credits of the film; junior, struggling writers in particular were simply paid and sent away. Salim-Javed changed this situation. Since their scripts were so successful, they had the power to make demands on film-makers. They not only insisted on being paid much more than what had been the norm until then, but also ensured that their name was on the film credits, and also that they were involved at many stages of the process, including screenplay and dialogues.\n\nWhile credited under the name \"Salim-Javed\", the screenplay of \"Zanjeer\" was almost entirely written by Salim Khan alone, before bringing Javed Akhtar on board and crediting it under the name \"Salim-Javed\". Salim Khan was also instrumental in launching the career of Amitabh Bachchan, who was a struggling actor before being discovered by Salim-Javed, who were impressed by his acting abilities and insisted on casting him in the lead roles for their films. Salim Khan was also personally responsible for introducing Bachchan to directors such as Prakash Mehra and Manmohan Desai.\n\nSalim Khan, after splitting, from Javed wrote script and dialogues for successful movies like \"Angaaray\" (1986), \"Naam\" (1986), \"Kabzaa\" (1988) and \"Jurm\" (1990). For \"Angaaray\", Rajesh Khanna asked director Rajesh Sethi to go to Salim Khan and rework on the script he had.\n\nSalim was not very active in films from 1996 as the fold he wrote like Akayla, Toofan and others between 1988 and 1996 flopped. He wrote scripts for thirteen films from 1983 to 1996, after his split with Javed Akhthar. These included \"Majdhaar\" and the hit film \"Patthar Ke Phool\" which starred his son Salman Khan. Other notable hits were the scripts for \"Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya\" and \"Auzaar,\" both of which were produced by his youngest son Sohail Khan and starred Salman.\n\nHis last unofficial partnership with Javed Akhtar was for the film \"Baghban\" (2003). Amitabh Bachchan requested to Javed Akhtar to write his final speech. Salman Khan, for his speech prior to that, requested to his father Salim Khan to write his speech. However, neither Salim Khan nor Javed Akhtar were credited.\n\nKhan is married to two ladies concurrently. His first marriage was to Sushila Charak, a Hindu, on 18 November 1964. Sushila's father, Baldev Singh Charak, was a Hindu from Jammu, while her mother was a Maharashtrian Hindu lady. Khan and Sushila/Salma have four children together; three sons, Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail, and one daughter, Alvira Khan Agnihotri. In 1981, Khan married actress Helen Richardson, a Christian lady whose father was Anglo-Indian and mother was Burmese. Some years later, they adopted a girl named Arpita, daughter of a homeless woman who died on a Mumbai footpath.\n\nKhan's eldest son, Salman Khan, is one of the most commercially successful actors of Indian cinema. His other two sons, Arbaaz and Sohail, are also actors and film producers. His elder daughter Alvira is married to former actor and film-maker Atul Agnihotri, while his younger daughter Arpita is married to Aayush Sharma, grandson of Sukh Ram, a former Minister of Himachal Pradesh and long-time member of the Congress party.\n\n\n\n\"Sholay\" (1975) was ranked first in the British Film Institute's 2002 poll of \"Top 10 Indian Films\" of all time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3610525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3610525", "title": "Score (game)", "text": "Score (game)\n\nIn games, score refers to an abstract quantity associated with a player or team. Score is usually measured in the abstract unit of points, and events in the game can raise or lower the score of different parties. Most games with score use it as a quantitative indicator of success in the game, and in competitive games, a goal is often made of attaining a better score than one's opponents in order to win.\n\nIn video games that features scoring, points are usually optional, side component of gaming. Players may achieve points through normal gameplay, but their score will often not have an immediate relevance to the game itself. Instead, playing to beat a \"high score\" set by the game program, another player or oneself becomes an extra challenge, adding replay value.\n\nIn modern gaming, the presence of a score is not as ubiquitous as it was in the past. During the era of arcade games, when, because of the technical limitations of the time, games could not be \"won\" or \"completed\" but were instead endless cycles of continuous gameplay, points had a much greater relevance. Many modern games no longer keep track of scores, and many no longer feature an option to save or record high scores. However, some games, such as role-playing games, have experience points, skill points, and use money or treasure, which can all be used to buy or upgrade skills and objects.\n\nIn fighting games, scoring a very high number of points could result in unlockable players or modes. In some games, reaching certain scores gives an extra life, or a continue.\n\nIn puzzle games, scores are usually gained by solving the puzzles quickly. Higher scores can be gained by performing combos of puzzle solving. There is often a time bonus which can add extra points. The level number is often a multiplier on the points, so higher scores are possible on harder levels. Level multipliers can also be picked up in some games, to further multiply your points bonus.\n\nIn other games, points are typically gained from defeating monsters and enemies. When defeating a boss, a proportionally large number of points is usually rewarded. Extra points can be gained from gathering items, such as power-ups or other pick-ups.\n\nUsually, when a player gets a certain number of points, they may get an extra life or go on to a higher level. Points can be often used as currency which can be redeemed for rewards and player upgrades.\n\nThe high score of a video game is usually the highest logged point value. Many games will have a list of several high scores, called the high score table.\n\nThe concept of a high score first achieved cultural significance with the rise in popularity of pinball machines and electro-mechanical arcade games. Players who achieve a high score are often greeted with a congratulatory message and are able to enter their initials or name into the machine. Their score and name will remain there until someone \"knocks\" them off the high score list by achieving a higher score. For this reason, high scores are inherently competitive and may sometimes involve one-upmanship against other players.\n\nThe high score has a close association to the \"free game.\" When in an arcade, many games will offer a player a free chance at another game if they achieve a high score. This has declined in popularity in recent years, as players are often allowed to play for as long as they can without losing, but not given free games even if they achieve a high score.\n\nThe first video game to use the term \"high score\" was Midway's \"Sea Wolf\" (1976). In these early video games, the player would attempt to reach a pre-determined high score within an allotted time period, after which they would win bonus playing time, since it was not possible to save the top score. Though the term \"high score\" was not used, the concept of reaching pre-determined scores to win bonus playing time was featured in earlier arcade video games such as Taito's racing game \"Speed Race\" (1974).\n\nThe high score concept changed in 1978 with the release of Taito's shoot 'em up \"Space Invaders\", where high scores were determined by gamers playing for as long as they could to stay alive, as high scores kept rising. This was made possible due to being the first game to save the player's score. The astounding popularity of \"Space Invaders\" stemmed from players returning to beat the current high scores, as players could now compete with each other over who had the highest score. In 1979, \"Space Invaders Part II\"\n\"Star Fire\" allowed players to enter initials next to their score. Since this data was stored in the machine's RAM, it was deleted every time the machine lost power, which in practice would almost invariably happen every night as operators preferred to leave the machines unplugged when the arcade was closed to avoid incurring unnecessary power costs.\n\nThe popularity of the high score has made it nearly ubiquitous among modern video games, become a defining feature for many games. Magazines such as Nintendo Power and Sega Visions would often publish high scores submitted by their readers. The high score became most popular when, starting in 1982, the Twin Galaxies Scoreboard began to appear in the pages of Video Games Magazine, Joystik Magazine, Computer Games Magazine, VideoGiochi Magazine, Video Games Player Magazine and Electronic Fun Magazine. Later, in the 1990s, all performances would have to be videotaped to verify the achievement.\n\nThe high score also exists in online games in various forms. The spread of the Internet has made it possible to compete with the rest of the world, rather than the players of a single machine or game. Many modern games have the ability to post his/her high score to a central webpage. Online multiplayer games, especially first person shooters, real time strategies, and role-playing video games often have ranking systems. These new high score lists and ranking systems often are more complex than conventional high score lists. Some are based on tournaments, while others track game servers continuously, keeping statistics for all players.\n\nSome games include default \"high scores\" that do not actually represent real players, but are displayed whenever the machine's memory is reset, often with generic initials such as \"AAA.\" These scores often represent certain levels of achievement for a player to aspire to, ensuring that there is always something for players to compete with. Many video games also have default high scores built in, sometimes attributed to fictitious entities (e.g. \"Commander Keen\") or to members of the game's development team.\n\nThe high score's prominence in video game culture, and even mainstream society has led to various pieces of art and entertainment. There is a cartoon titled \"High Score\". There is also a book entitled \"\". A 2007 documentary, \"\", follows the attempts to beat the high score in \"Donkey Kong\".\n\nIn an episode of the TV series \"Seinfeld\", George is astonished to find that the \"Frogger\" machine he played as a teen still retains his high score. With the owners wanting to get rid of it, George decides to keep the machine for posterity, the catch being that he has to move the game without unplugging it, because if he unplugs the game the high score will be erased. Unfortunately, the machine is destroyed when he unsuccessfully tries to move it across the street in a spoof of the gameplay.\n\nOn September 24, 2005, Twin Galaxies issued Poster #59, which publicized a $1,000 prize to the first gamer who could break George Costanza's fictitious Frogger high score of 863,050 points.\n\nOn August 1, 1982, the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard issued a colorful poster that listed the world record high scores for more than two dozen arcade video games. The poster was distributed among arcades worldwide. This was the first poster (#1) in a series of colorful posters that continues today, with poster #131 issued in October, 2008.\n\nIn an episode of \"Friends\" Chandler Bing puts in dirty words on all the high score positions on a PacMan machine. He then finds out that they are not blanked when the machine is reset so he has to break all his high scores to remove the offending words. (This is not possible on an actual PacMan machine; such machines only record one high score and do not allow the winning player to enter initials.) \n\nAccording to the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard, \"high-score\" attempts enjoyed as much press coverage as any other video-game-related topic reported in the media during the 1982-1985 period. Though the media was often focused on the amazing growth of the video game industry, it was equally as fascinated with the human side of gaming, as typified by the \"player vs machine\" showdowns that led to new world record high scores set on nearly a daily basis. In fact, Twin Galaxies reports that during that early era it was not unusual for there to be multiple new world records reported in the media on a single day.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32511", "title": "Vietnamese language", "text": "Vietnamese language\n\nVietnamese () is an Austroasiatic language that originated in Vietnam, where it is the national and official language. It is the native language of the Vietnamese (Kinh) people, as well as a first or second language for the many ethnic minorities of Vietnam. As a result of Vietnamese emigration and cultural influence, Vietnamese speakers are found throughout the world, notably in East and Southeast Asia, North America, Australia and Western Europe. Vietnamese has also been officially recognized as a minority language in the Czech Republic.\n\nVietnamese is the Austroasiatic language with by far the most speakers, several times as many as the rest of the family combined. Its vocabulary has borrowings from Chinese, and it formerly used a modified set of Chinese characters called chữ nôm given vernacular pronunciation. The Vietnamese alphabet (chữ quốc ngữ) in use today is a Latin alphabet with additional diacritics for tones and certain letters.\n\nAs a national language, Vietnamese is the official language used by everyone in Vietnam. It is similar to Yue Yu (越语) spoken by the Gin in southern Guangxi Province in China. However, the language spoken by the Gin is unintelligible to Vietnamese, although they share many similarities. A significant number of native speakers also reside in neighboring Cambodia and Laos.\n\nIn the United States, Vietnamese is the fifth most spoken language, with over 1.5 million speakers, who are concentrated in a handful of states. It is the third most spoken language in Texas and Washington; fourth in Georgia, Louisiana, and Virginia; and fifth in Arkansas and California. Vietnamese is the seventh most spoken language in Australia. In France, it is the most spoken Asian language and the eighth most spoken immigrant language at home.\n\nVietnamese is the sole official and national language of Vietnam. It is the first language of the majority of the Vietnamese population, as well as a first or second language for the country's ethnic minority groups.\nIn the Czech Republic, Vietnamese has been recognized as one of 14 minority languages, on the basis of communities that have resided in the country either traditionally or on a long-term basis. This status grants Czech citizens from the Vietnamese community the right to use Vietnamese with public authorities and at courts anywhere in the country. Moreover, it also grants the use of Vietnamese in public signage, election information, cultural institutions, and access to legal information and assistance in municipalities where at least 10% of the population is of the minority group.\n\nVietnamese is increasingly being taught in schools and institutions outside of Vietnam. In countries with strongly established Vietnamese-speaking communities such as Australia, Canada, France, and the United States, Vietnamese language education largely serves as a cultural role to link descendants of Vietnamese immigrants to their ancestral culture. Meanwhile, in countries near Vietnam such as Cambodia, Laos, South Korea, and Thailand, the increased role of Vietnamese in foreign language education is largely due to the growth and influence of Vietnam's economy.\n\nSince the 1980s, Vietnamese language schools () have been established for youth in many Vietnamese-speaking communities around the world, notably in the United States.\n\nHistoric and stronger trade and diplomatic relations with Vietnam and a growing interest among the French Vietnamese population (one of France's most established non-European ethnic groups) of their ancestral culture have also led to an increasing number of institutions in France, including universities, to offer formal courses in the language.\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Vietnamese German community has enlisted the support of city governments to bring Vietnamese into high school curricula for the purpose of teaching and reminding Vietnamese German students of their mother-tongue. Furthermore, there has also been a number of Germans studying Vietnamese due to increased economic investment in Vietnam.\n\nVietnamese is taught in schools in the form of dual immersion to a varying degree in Cambodia, Laos, and the United States. Classes teach students subjects in Vietnamese and another language. Furthermore, in Thailand, Vietnamese is one of the most popular foreign languages in schools and colleges.\n\nVietnamese was identified more than 150 years ago as part of the Mon–Khmer branch of the Austroasiatic language family (a family that also includes Khmer, spoken in Cambodia, as well as various tribal and regional languages, such as the Munda and Khasi languages spoken in eastern India, and others in southern China). Later, Muong was found to be more closely related to Vietnamese than other Mon–Khmer languages, and a Viet–Muong subgrouping was established, also including Thavung, Chut, Cuoi, etc. The term \"Vietic\" was proposed by Hayes (1992), who proposed to redefine Viet–Muong as referring to a subbranch of Vietic containing only Vietnamese and Muong. The term \"Vietic\" is used, among others, by Gérard Diffloth, with a slightly different proposal on subclassification, within which the term \"Viet–Muong\" refers to a lower subgrouping (within an eastern Vietic branch) consisting of Vietnamese dialects, Muong dialects, and Nguồn (of Quảng Bình Province).\n\nAs a result of 1000 years of Chinese rule, much of the Vietnamese lexicon relating to science and politics is derived from Chinese — see Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. Some 30% to 60% of the lexical stock has naturalized word borrowings from Chinese, although many compound words are composed of native Vietnamese words combined with naturalized word borrowings (i.e. having Vietnamese pronunciation). As a result of French occupation, Vietnamese has since had many words borrowed from the French language, for example (from French ). Nowadays, many new words are being added to the language's lexicon due to heavy Western cultural influence; these are usually borrowed from English, for example TV (though usually seen in the written form as ). Sometimes these borrowings are calques literally translated into Vietnamese (for example, \"software\" is calqued into , which literally means \"soft part\"). Some borrowings nowadays, usually names, are multi-syllabic, for example, (Cambodia).\n\nVietnamese has two types of similes: Meaning Similes and Rhyming Similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:\n\nCompare the above rhyming Vietnamese example to the English phrase \"(as) drunk as a skunk\", which is also a rhyming simile, and \"(as) poor as a church mouse\", which is only semantic.\n\nLike other Southeast Asian languages, Vietnamese has a comparatively large number of vowels. \n\nBelow is a vowel diagram of Hanoi Vietnamese (including centering diphthongs):\n\nFront and central vowels (\"i\", \"ê\", \"e\", \"ư\", \"â\", \"ơ\", \"ă\", \"a\") are unrounded, whereas the back vowels (\"u\", \"ô\", \"o\") are rounded. The vowels \"â\" and \"ă\" are pronounced very short, much shorter than the other vowels. Thus, \"ơ\" and \"â\" are basically pronounced the same except that \"ơ\" is of normal length while \"â\" is short – the same applies to the vowels long \"a\" and short \"ă\" .\n\nThe centering diphthongs are formed with only the three high vowels (\"i\", \"ư\", \"u\"). They are generally spelled as \"ia\", \"ưa\", \"ua\" when they end a word and are spelled \"iê\", \"ươ\", \"uô\", respectively, when they are followed by a consonant.\n\nIn addition to single vowels (or monophthongs) and centering diphthongs, Vietnamese has closing diphthongs and triphthongs. The closing diphthongs and triphthongs consist of a main vowel component followed by a shorter semivowel offglide or . There are restrictions on the high offglides: cannot occur after a front vowel (\"i\", \"ê\", \"e\") nucleus and cannot occur after a back vowel (\"u\", \"ô\", \"o\") nucleus.\n\nThe correspondence between the orthography and pronunciation is complicated. For example, the offglide is usually written as \"i\"; however, it may also be represented with \"y\". In addition, in the diphthongs and the letters \"y\" and \"i\" also indicate the pronunciation of the main vowel: \"ay\" = \"ă\" + , \"ai\" = \"a\" + . Thus, \"tay\" \"hand\" is while \"tai\" \"ear\" is . Similarly, \"u\" and \"o\" indicate different pronunciations of the main vowel: \"au\" = \"ă\" + , \"ao\" = \"a\" + . Thus, \"thau\" \"brass\" is while \"thao\" \"raw silk\" is .\n\nThe consonants that occur in Vietnamese are listed below in the Vietnamese orthography with the phonetic pronunciation to the right.\n\nSome consonant sounds are written with only one letter (like \"p\"), other consonant sounds are written with a digraph (like \"ph\"), and others are written with more than one letter or digraph (the velar stop is written variously as \"c\", \"k\", or \"q\").\n\nNot all dialects of Vietnamese have the same consonant in a given word (although all dialects use the same spelling in the written language). See the language variation section for further elaboration.\n\nThe analysis of syllable-final orthographic \"ch\" and \"nh\" in Hanoi Vietnamese has had different analyses. One analysis has final \"ch\", \"nh\" as being phonemes contrasting with syllable-final \"t\", \"c\" and \"n\", \"ng\" and identifies final \"ch\" with the syllable-initial \"ch\" . The other analysis has final \"ch\" and \"nh\" as predictable allophonic variants of the velar phonemes and that occur after the upper front vowels \"i\" and \"ê\" ; although they also occur after \"a\", but in such cases are believed to have resulted from an earlier \"e\" which diphthongized to \"ai\" (cf. \"ach\" from \"aic\", \"anh\" from \"aing\"). (See Vietnamese phonology: Analysis of final \"ch\", \"nh\" for further details.)\n\nEach Vietnamese syllable is pronounced with an inherent tone, centered on the main vowel or group of vowels. Tones differ in:\n\nTone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel (most of the tone diacritics appear above the vowel; however, the \"nặng\" tone dot diacritic goes below the vowel). The six tones in the northern varieties (including Hanoi), with their self-referential Vietnamese names, are:\n\nOther dialects of Vietnamese have fewer tones (typically only five).\n\nIn Vietnamese poetry, tones are classed into two groups:\n\nWords with tones belonging to a particular tone group must occur in certain positions within the poetic verse.\n\nVietnamese Catholics practice a distinctive style of prayer recitation called , in which each tone is assigned a specific note or sequence of notes.\n\nThe Vietnamese language has several mutually intelligible regional varieties (or dialects). The five main dialects are as follows:\n\nVietnamese has traditionally been divided into three dialect regions: North, Central, and South. However, Michel Ferlus and Nguyễn Tài Cẩn offer evidence for considering a North-Central region separate from Central. The term \"Haut-Annam\" refers to dialects spoken from northern Nghệ An Province to southern (former) Thừa Thiên Province that preserve archaic features (like consonant clusters and undiphthongized vowels) that have been lost in other modern dialects.\n\nThese dialect regions differ mostly in their sound systems (see below), but also in vocabulary (including basic vocabulary, non-basic vocabulary, and grammatical words) and grammar. The North-central and Central regional varieties, which have a significant amount of vocabulary differences, are generally less mutually intelligible to Northern and Southern speakers. There is less internal variation within the Southern region than the other regions due to its relatively late settlement by Vietnamese speakers (in around the end of the 15th century). The North-central region is particularly conservative; its pronunciation has diverged less from Vietnamese orthography than the other varieties, which tend to merge certain sounds. Along the coastal areas, regional variation has been neutralized to a certain extent, while more mountainous regions preserve more variation. As for sociolinguistic attitudes, the North-central varieties are often felt to be \"peculiar\" or \"difficult to understand\" by speakers of other dialects, despite the fact that their pronunciation fits the written language the most closely; this is typically because of various words in their vocabulary which are unfamiliar to other speakers (see the example vocabulary table below).\nThe large movements of people between North and South beginning in the mid-20th century and continuing to this day have resulted in a sizeable number of Southern residents speaking in the Northern accent/dialect and, to a greater extent, Northern residents speaking in the Southern accent/dialect. Following the Geneva Accords of 1954 that called for the temporary division of the country, about a million northerners (mainly from Hanoi, Haiphong and the surrounding Red River Delta areas) moved south (mainly to Saigon and heavily to Biên Hòa and Vũng Tàu, and the surrounding areas) as part of Operation Passage to Freedom. About 3% (~30,000) of that number of people made the move in the reverse direction (\"Tập kết ra Bắc\", literally \"go to the North.)\n\nFollowing the reunification of Vietnam in 1975–76, Northern and North-Central speakers from the densely populated Red River Delta and the traditionally poorer provinces of Nghệ An, Hà Tĩnh and Quảng Bình have continued to move South to look for better economic opportunities, beginning with the Hanoi government's \"New Economic Zones program\" which lasted from 1975–85. The first half of the program (1975–80), resulted in 1.3 million people sent to the New Economic Zones (NEZs), majority of which were relocated in the southern half of the country in previously uninhabited areas, of which 550,000 were Northerners. The second half (1981–85) saw almost 1 million Northerners relocated to the NEZs. As well, government and military personnel, many from Northern and north-central Vietnam, are posted to various locations throughout the country, often away from their home regions. More recently, the growth of the free market system has resulted in business people and tourists traveling to distant parts of Vietnam. These movements have resulted in some small blending of the dialects, but more significantly, have made the Northern dialect more easily understood in the South and vice versa. Most Southerners, when singing modern/old popular Vietnamese songs, do so in the Northern accent. This is true in Vietnam as well as in the overseas Vietnamese communities.\n\nThe syllable-initial \"ch\" and \"tr\" digraphs are pronounced distinctly in North-central, Central, and Southern varieties, but are merged in Northern varieties (i.e. they are both pronounced the same way). The North-central varieties preserve three distinct pronunciations for \"d\", \"gi\", and \"r\" whereas the North has a three-way merger and the Central and South have a merger of \"d\" and \"gi\" while keeping \"r\" distinct. At the end of syllables, palatals \"ch\" and \"nh\" have merged with alveolars \"t\" and \"n\", which, in turn, have also partially merged with velars \"c\" and \"ng\" in Central and Southern varieties.\n\nIn addition to the regional variation described above, there is also a merger of \"l\" and \"n\" in certain rural varieties:\n\nVariation between \"l\" and \"n\" can be found even in mainstream Vietnamese in certain words. For example, the numeral \"five\" appears as \"năm\" by itself and in compound numerals like \"năm mươi\" \"fifty\" but appears as in \"fifteen\" (see Vietnamese grammar#Cardinal). In some northern varieties, this numeral appears with an initial \"nh\" instead of \"l\": \"twenty-five\" vs. mainstream .\n\nThe consonant clusters that were originally present in Middle Vietnamese (of the 17th century) have been lost in almost all modern Vietnamese varieties (but retained in other closely related Vietic languages). However, some speech communities have preserved some of these archaic clusters: \"sky\" is with a cluster in Hảo Nho (Yên Mô prefecture, Ninh Bình Province) but \"trời\" in Southern Vietnamese and in Hanoi Vietnamese (initial single consonants , respectively).\n\nGenerally, the Northern varieties have six tones while those in other regions have five tones. The \"hỏi\" and \"ngã\" tones are distinct in North and some North-central varieties (although often with different pitch contours) but have merged in Central, Southern, and some North-central varieties (also with different pitch contours). Some North-central varieties (such as Vietnamese) have a merger of the \"ngã\" and \"nặng\" tones while keeping the \"hỏi\" tone distinct. Still other North-central varieties have a three-way merger of \"hỏi\", \"ngã\", and \"nặng\" resulting in a four-tone system. In addition, there are several phonetic differences (mostly in pitch contour and phonation type) in the tones among dialects.\n\nThe table above shows the pitch contour of each tone using Chao tone number notation (where 1 = lowest pitch, 5 = highest pitch); glottalization (creaky, stiff, harsh) is indicated with the symbol; murmured voice with ; glottal stop with ; sub-dialectal variants are separated with commas. (See also the tone section below.)\n\nVietnamese, like many languages in Southeast Asia, is an analytic language. Vietnamese does not use morphological marking of case, gender, number or tense (and, as a result, has no finite/nonfinite distinction). Also like other languages in the region, Vietnamese syntax conforms to subject–verb–object word order, is head-initial (displaying modified-modifier ordering), and has a noun classifier system. Additionally, it is pro-drop, wh-in-situ, and allows verb serialization.\n\nSome Vietnamese sentences with English word glosses and translations are provided below.\n\nVietnameses speak date in the format \"[date] [month] [year]\". Each month's name is just the ordinal of that month appended after the word \"tháng\", which means \"month\". Traditional Vietnamese however assigns other names to some months and these names are mostly used in the lunar calendar.\n\nWhen written in the short form, \"D/M/YYYY\" is preferred.\n\n\"Example:\"\n\nThe Vietnamese prefer writing numbers with a comma as the decimal separator, and either spaces or dots to group the digits. An example is 1 629,15 (one thousand six hundred twenty-nine point fifteen). Because a comma is used as the decimal separator, a semicolon is used to separate two numbers instead.\n\nUp to the late 19th century, two writing systems based on Chinese characters were used in Vietnam.\nAll formal writing, including government business, scholarship and formal literature, was done in Classical Chinese (\"chữ nho\" \"scholar's characters\").\n\nFolk literature in Vietnamese was recorded using the \"chữ Nôm\" script, in which many Chinese characters were borrowed and many more modified and invented to represent native Vietnamese words. Created in the 13th century or earlier, the \"Nôm\" writing reached its zenith in the 18th century when many Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in Nôm, most notably Nguyễn Du and Hồ Xuân Hương (dubbed \"the Queen of Nôm poetry\").\nHowever it was only used for official purposes during the brief Hồ and Tây Sơn dynasties.\n\nA Vietnamese Catholic, Nguyễn Trường Tộ, sent petitions to the Court which suggested a Chinese character-based syllabary which would be used for Vietnamese sounds; however, his petition failed. The French colonial administration sought to eliminate the Chinese writing system, Confucianism, and other Chinese influences from Vietnam by getting rid of Nôm.\n\nA romanization of Vietnamese was codified in the 17th century by the French Jesuit missionary Alexandre de Rhodes (1591–1660), based on works of earlier Portuguese missionaries Gaspar do Amaral and António Barbosa. This Vietnamese alphabet (\"chữ quốc ngữ\" or \"national script\") was gradually expanded from its initial domain in Christian writing to become more popular among the general public.\nHowever, the Romanized script did not come to predominate until the beginning of the 20th century, when education became widespread and a simpler writing system was found more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population.\nUnder French Indochina colonial rule, French superseded Chinese in administration.\nVietnamese written with the alphabet became required for all public documents in 1910 by issue of a decree by the French Résident Supérieur of the protectorate of Tonkin. By the middle of the 20th century virtually all writing was done in \"chữ quốc ngữ\", which became the official script on independence. Chữ nho was still in use on early North Vietnamese and late French Indochinese banknotes issued after World War II, but fell out of official use shortly thereafter.\nOnly a few scholars and some extremely elderly people are able to read \"chữ Nôm\" today. In China, members of the Jing minority still write in chữ Nôm. \n\nChanges in the script were made by French scholars and administrators and by conferences held after independence during 1954–1974. The script now reflects a so-called \"Middle Vietnamese\" dialect that has vowels and final consonants most similar to northern dialects and initial consonants most similar to southern dialects (Nguyễn 1996). This Middle Vietnamese is presumably close to the Hanoi variety as spoken sometime after 1600 but before the present. (This is not unlike how English orthography is based on the Chancery Standard of Late Middle English, with many spellings retained even after the Great Vowel Shift.)\n\nThe Unicode character set contains all Vietnamese characters and the Vietnamese currency symbol. On systems that do not support Unicode, many 8-bit Vietnamese code pages are available such as Vietnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange (VSCII) or Windows-1258. Where ASCII must be used, Vietnamese letters are often typed using the VIQR convention, though this is largely unnecessary with the increasing ubiquity of Unicode. There are many software tools that help type true Vietnamese text on US keyboards, such as WinVNKey and Unikey on Windows, or MacVNKey on Macintosh.\n\nIt seems likely that in the distant past, Vietnamese shared more characteristics common to other languages in the Austroasiatic family, such as an inflectional morphology and a richer set of consonant clusters, which have subsequently disappeared from the language. However, Vietnamese appears to have been heavily influenced by its location in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, with the result that it has acquired or converged toward characteristics such as isolating morphology and phonemically distinctive tones, through processes of tonogenesis. These characteristics have become part of many of the genetically unrelated languages of Southeast Asia; for example, Tsat (a member of the Malayo-Polynesian group within Austronesian), and Vietnamese each developed tones as a phonemic feature.\n\nThe ancestor of the Vietnamese language is usually believed to have been originally based in the area of the Red River in what is now northern Vietnam. However, Chamberlain argues that the Red River Delta region was originally Tai-speaking and became Vietnamese-speaking only between the seventh and ninth centuries AD, as a result of immigration from the south, i. e., modern central Vietnam, where the highly distinctive and conservative North-Central Vietnamese dialects are spoken today. Therefore, the region of origin of Vietnamese (and the earlier Viet–Muong) was well south of the Red River.\n\nLike the ethnonym Lao, the name Yue/Việt originally referred to Tai–Kadai-speaking groups. In northern Vietnam, these later adopted Viet–Muong and further north Chinese varieties, where the designation Yue Chinese preserves the ethnonym. (Both in Vietnam and southern China, however, many Tai–Kadai languages remain in use.) This explains the fact that the same ethnonym Yue ~ Việt is associated with groups that speak Tai–Kadai, Austroasiatic and Chinese languages, which are typologically similar and share significant amounts of lexicon, but have different origins.\n\nLinguists Sagart (2011) and Bellwood (2013) favour the middle Yangzte, although there is no direct linguistic evidence for this, and the expansion of the phylum in its present form would have to begin further south.\n\nDistinctive tonal variations emerged during the subsequent expansion of the Vietnamese language and people into what is now central and southern Vietnam through conquest of the ancient nation of Champa and the Khmer people of the Mekong Delta in the vicinity of present-day Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon.\n\nVietnamese was primarily influenced by Chinese, which came to predominate politically in the 2nd century BC. After Vietnam achieved independence in the 10th century, the ruling class adopted Classical Chinese as the medium of government, scholarship and literature. With the dominance of Chinese came radical importation of Chinese vocabulary and grammatical influence. A portion of the Vietnamese lexicon in all realms consists of Sino-Vietnamese words (They comprise about a third of the Vietnamese lexicon, and may account for as much as 60% of the vocabulary used in formal texts.)\n\nWhen France invaded Vietnam in the late 19th century, French gradually replaced Chinese as the official language in education and government. Vietnamese adopted many French terms, such as \"đầm\" (dame, from \"madame\"), \"ga\" (train station, from \"gare\"), \"sơ mi\" (shirt, from \"chemise\"), and \"búp bê\" (doll, from \"poupée\"). In addition, many Sino-Vietnamese terms were devised for Western ideas imported through the French.\n\nHenri Maspero described six periods of the Vietnamese language:\n\nThe following diagram shows the phonology of Proto-Viet–Muong (the nearest ancestor of Vietnamese and the closely related Muong language), along with the outcomes in the modern language:\n\n\nThe following initial clusters occurred, with outcomes indicated:\n\nNote also that a large number of words were borrowed from Middle Chinese, forming part of the Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. These caused the original introduction of the retroflex sounds and (modern \"s\", \"tr\") into the language.\n\nProto-Viet–Muong had no tones to speak of. The tones later developed in some of the daughter languages from distinctions in the initial and final consonants. Vietnamese tones developed as follows:\n\nGlottal-ending syllables ended with a glottal stop , while fricative-ending syllables ended with or . Both types of syllables could co-occur with a resonant (e.g. or ).\n\nAt some point, a tone split occurred, as in many other Southeast Asian languages. Essentially, an allophonic distinction developed in the tones, whereby the tones in syllables with voiced initials were pronounced differently from those with voiceless initials. (Approximately speaking, the voiced allotones were pronounced with additional breathy voice or creaky voice and with lowered pitch. The quality difference predominates in today's northern varieties, e.g. in Hanoi, while in the southern varieties the pitch difference predominates, as in Ho Chi Minh City.) Subsequent to this, the plain-voiced stops became voiceless and the allotones became new phonemic tones. Note that the implosive stops were unaffected, and in fact developed tonally as if they were unvoiced. (This behavior is common to all East Asian languages with implosive stops.)\n\nAs noted above, Proto-Viet–Muong had sesquisyllabic words with an initial minor syllable (in addition to, and independent of, initial clusters in the main syllable). When a minor syllable occurred, the main syllable's initial consonant was intervocalic and as a result suffered lenition, becoming a voiced fricative. The minor syllables were eventually lost, but not until the tone split had occurred. As a result, words in modern Vietnamese with voiced fricatives occur in all six tones, and the tonal register reflects the voicing of the minor-syllable prefix and not the voicing of the main-syllable stop in Proto-Viet–Muong that produced the fricative. For similar reasons, words beginning with and occur in both registers. (Thompson 1976 reconstructed voiceless resonants to account for outcomes where resonants occur with a first-register tone, but this is no longer considered necessary, at least by Ferlus.)\n\nThe writing system used for Vietnamese is based closely on the system developed by Alexandre de Rhodes for his 1651 \"Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum\". It reflects the pronunciation of the Vietnamese of Hanoi at that time, a stage commonly termed \"Middle Vietnamese\" (). The pronunciation of the \"rime\" of the syllable, i.e. all parts other than the initial consonant (optional glide, vowel nucleus, tone and final consonant), appears nearly identical between Middle Vietnamese and modern Hanoi pronunciation. On the other hand, the Middle Vietnamese pronunciation of the initial consonant differs greatly from all modern dialects, and in fact is significantly closer to the modern Saigon dialect than the modern Hanoi dialect.\n\nThe following diagram shows the orthography and pronunciation of Middle Vietnamese:\n\nNote that \"b\" and \"p\" never contrast in any position, suggesting that they are allophones.\n\nThe language also has three clusters at the beginning of syllables, which have since disappeared:\n\n\nMost of the unusual correspondences between spelling and modern pronunciation are explained by Middle Vietnamese. Note in particular:\nDe Rhodes's orthography also made use of an apex diacritic to indicate a final labial-velar nasal , an allophone of that is peculiar to the Hanoi dialect to the present day. This diacritic is often mistaken for a tilde in modern reproductions of early Vietnamese writing.\n\nA language game known as \"nói lái\" is used by Vietnamese speakers. \"Nói lái\" involves switching the tones in a pair of words and also the order of the two words or the first consonant and rime of each word; the resulting \"nói lái\" pair preserves the original sequence of tones. Some examples:\n\nThe resulting transformed phrase often has a different meaning but sometimes may just be a nonsensical word pair. \"Nói lái\" can be used to obscure the original meaning and thus soften the discussion of a socially sensitive issue, as with \"dấm đài\" and \"hoảng chưa\" (above) or, when implied (and not overtly spoken), to deliver a hidden subtextual message, as with \"bồi tây\". Naturally, \"nói lái\" can be used for a humorous effect.\n\nAnother word game somewhat reminiscent of pig latin is played by children. Here a nonsense syllable (chosen by the child) is prefixed onto a target word's syllables, then their initial consonants and rimes are switched with the tone of the original word remaining on the new switched rime.\n\nThis language game is often used as a \"secret\" or \"coded\" language useful for obscuring messages from adult comprehension.\n\n\"The Tale of Kieu\" is an epic narrative poem by the celebrated poet Nguyễn Du, (), which is often considered the most significant work of Vietnamese literature. It was originally written in Chữ Nôm (titled \"Đoạn Trường Tân Thanh\" ) and is widely taught in Vietnam today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch projects and data resources\n"}
{"id": "2002341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002341", "title": "Vocal register", "text": "Vocal register\n\nA vocal register is a range of tones in the human voice produced by a particular vibratory pattern of the vocal folds. These registers include modal voice (or normal voice), vocal fry, falsetto, and the whistle register.\nRegisters originate in laryngeal function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds.\n\nIn speech pathology, the vocal register has three components: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Although this view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogists, others define vocal registration more loosely than in the sciences, using the term to denote various theories of how the human voice changes, both subjectively and objectively, as it moves through its pitch range. There are many divergent theories on vocal registers within vocal pedagogy, making the term somewhat confusing and at times controversial within the field of singing. Vocal pedagogists may use the term vocal register to refer to any of the following:\n\n\nManuel Garcia II was one of the first to develop a scientific definition of registers, a definition that is still used by pedagogues and vocal teachers today\nAnother definition worth considering is from Clifton Ware. \nA register consists of the homogeneous tone qualities produced by the same mechanical system whereas registration is the process of using and combining the registers to achieve artistic singing. For example: a skilled singer moves through their range and dynamics smoothly, so that you are unaware of register changes. This process could be described as good or clean registration.\nThe term “register” originated in the sixteenth century. Before then it was recognized that there were different “voices”. As teachers started to notice how different the ranges on either side of the passaggios or breaks in the voice were, they were compared to different sets of pipes in an organ. These clusters of pipes were called registers, so the same term was adopted for voices.\n\nVocal registers arise from different vibratory patterns produced by the vocal cords. Research by speech pathologists and some vocal pedagogists has revealed that the vocal cords are capable of producing at least four distinct vibratory forms, although not all persons can produce all of them. The first of these vibratory forms is known as natural or normal voice; another name for it is modal voice, a term currently widely used in both speech pathology and vocal pedagogy publications. In this usage, modal refers to the natural disposition or manner of action of the vocal cords. The other three vibratory forms are known as vocal fry, falsetto, and whistle. Each of these four registers has its own vibratory pattern, its own pitch area (although there is some overlapping), and its own characteristic sound. Arranged by the pitch areas covered, vocal fry is the lowest register, modal voice is next, then falsetto, and finally the whistle register.\n\nWhile speech pathologists and scholars of phonetics consistently divide the voice into these four registers, vocal pedagogists are divided on this issue. Indiscriminate use of the word register has led to much confusion and controversy about the number of registers in the human voice within vocal pedagogical circles. This controversy does not exist within speech pathology and the other sciences, because vocal registers are viewed from a purely physiological standpoint that is concerned with laryngeal function. Various writers concerned with the art of singing state that there are anywhere from one to seven registers present. The diversity of opinion is quite wide and there is no consensus or single point of view.\n\nThe prevailing practice within vocal pedagogy is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are designated \"chest\", \"head\", and \"falsetto\" and women's voices are \"chest\", \"middle\", and \"head\". This way of classifying registers, however, is not universally accepted. Many vocal pedagogists partially blame this confusion on the incorrect use of the terms \"chest register\" and \"head register\". These professionals argue that, since all registers originate in laryngeal function, it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. The vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms \"chest voice\" and \"head voice\" over the term register. Many of the problems described as register problems are actually problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the multiplicity of registers which some vocal pedagogists advocate. For more information on resonance, see Vocal resonation.\n\nThe confusion which exists concerning the definition and number of registers is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.\n\nIf a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, her laryngeal function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur, with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a passaggio or a ponticello. Vocal pedagogists teach that, with study, a singer can move effortlessly from one register to another with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who prefer the theory of \"blending registers\" usually help students through the \"passage\" from one register to another by hiding their \"lift\" (where the voice changes).\n\nHowever, many pedagogists disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has affected the different views on vocal registration.\n\nThe vocal fry register is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose glottal closure which will permit air to bubble through with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency. The chief use of vocal fry in singing is to obtain pitches of very low frequency which are not available in modal voice. This register may be used therapeutically to improve the lower part of the modal register. This register is not used often in singing, but male quartet pieces, and certain styles of folk music for both men and women have been known to do so.\n\nThe modal voice is the usual register for speaking and singing, and the vast majority of both are done in this register. As pitch rises in this register, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their edges become thinner. A well-trained singer or speaker can phonate two octaves or more in the modal register with consistent production, beauty of tone, dynamic variety, and vocal freedom. This is possible only if the singer or speaker avoids static laryngeal adjustments and allows the progression from the bottom to the top of the register to be a carefully graduated continuum of readjustments.\n\nThe falsetto register lies above the modal voice register and overlaps the modal register by approximately one octave. The characteristic sound of falsetto is flute-like with few overtones present. Both men and women can phonate in the falsetto register. The essential difference between the modal and falsetto registers lies in the amount and type of vocal cord involvement. The falsetto voice is produced by the vibration of the ligamentous edges of the vocal cords, in whole or in part, and the main body of the fold is more or less relaxed. In contrast, the modal voice involves the whole vocal cord with the glottis opening at the bottom first and then at the top. The falsetto voice is also more limited in dynamic variation and tone quality than the modal voice.\n\nThe whistle register is the highest register of the human voice. The whistle register is so called because the timbre of the notes that are produced from this register are similar to that of a whistle or the upper notes of a flute, whereas the modal register tends to have a warmer, less shrill timbre. Women of all voice types can use the whistle register. With proper vocal training, it is possible for most women and some men to develop this part of the voice. Children can also phonate in the whistle register, without conscious effort.\n\n"}
{"id": "33955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33955", "title": "WordNet", "text": "WordNet\n\nWordNet is a lexical database for the English language. It groups English words into sets of synonyms called \"synsets\", provides short definitions and usage examples, and records a number of relations among these synonym sets or their members. WordNet can thus be seen as a combination of dictionary and thesaurus. While it is accessible to human users via a web browser, its primary use is in automatic text analysis and artificial intelligence applications. The database and software tools have been released under a BSD style license and are freely available for download from the WordNet website. Both the lexicographic data (\"lexicographer files\") and the compiler (called \"grind\") for producing the distributed database are available.\nWordNet was created in the Cognitive Science Laboratory of Princeton University under the direction of psychology professor George Armitage Miller starting in 1985 and has been directed in recent years by Christiane Fellbaum. The project received funding from government agencies including the National Science Foundation, DARPA, the Disruptive Technology Office (formerly the Advanced Research and Development Activity), and REFLEX. George Miller and Christiane Fellbaum were awarded the 2006 Antonio Zampolli Prize for their work with WordNet.\n\nAs of November 2012 WordNet's latest Online-version is 3.1. The database contains 155 327 words organized in 175 979 synsets for a total of 207 016 word-sense pairs; in compressed form, it is about 12 megabytes in size.\n\nWordNet includes the lexical categories nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs but ignores prepositions, determiners and other function words.\n\nWords from the same lexical category that are roughly synonymous are grouped into synsets. Synsets include simplex words as well as collocations like \"eat out\" and \"car pool.\" The different senses of a polysemous word form are assigned to different synsets. The meaning of a synset is further clarified with a short defining \"gloss\" and one or more usage examples. An example adjective synset is:\n\nAll synsets are connected to other synsets by means of semantic relations. These relations, which are not all shared by all lexical categories, include:\n\nThese semantic relations hold among all members of the linked synsets. Individual synset members (words) can also be connected with lexical relations. For example, (one sense of) the noun \"director\" is linked to (one sense of) the verb \"direct\" from which it is derived via a \"morphosemantic\" link.\n\nThe morphology functions of the software distributed with the database try to deduce the lemma or stem form of a word from the user's input. Irregular forms are stored in a list, and looking up \"ate\" will return \"eat,\" for example.\n\nBoth nouns and verbs are organized into hierarchies, defined by hypernym or \"IS A\" relationships. For instance, one sense of the word \"dog\" is found following hypernym hierarchy; the words at the same level represent synset members. Each set of synonyms has a unique index.\n\n\nAt the top level, these hierarchies are organized into 25 beginner \"trees\" for nouns and 15 for verbs (called \"lexicographic files\" at a maintenance level). All are linked to a unique beginner synset, \"entity\".\nNoun hierarchies are far deeper than verb hierarchies\n\nAdjectives are not organized into hierarchical trees. Instead, two \"central\" antonyms such as \"hot\" and \"cold\" form binary poles, while 'satellite' synonyms such as \"steaming\" and \"chilly\" connect to their respective poles via a \"similarity\" relations. The adjectives can be visualized in this way as \"dumbbells\" rather than as \"trees\".\n\nThe initial goal of the WordNet project was to build a lexical database that would be consistent with theories of human semantic memory developed in the late 1960s. Psychological experiments indicated that speakers organized their knowledge of concepts in an economic, hierarchical fashion. Retrieval time required to access conceptual knowledge seemed to be directly related to the number of hierarchies the speaker needed to \"traverse\" to access the knowledge. Thus, speakers could more quickly verify that \"canaries can sing\" because a canary is a songbird, but required slightly more time to verify that \"canaries can fly\" (where they had to access the concept \"bird\" on the superordinate level) and even more time to verify \"canaries have skin\" (requiring look-up across multiple levels of hyponymy, up to \"animal\").\nWhile such experiments and the underlying theories have been subject to criticism, some of WordNet's organization is consistent with experimental evidence. For example, anomic aphasia selectively affects speakers' ability to produce words from a specific semantic category, a WordNet hierarchy. Antonymous adjectives (WordNet's central adjectives in the dumbbell structure) are found to co-occur far more frequently than chance, a fact that has been found to hold for many languages.\n\nWordNet is sometimes called an ontology, a persistent claim that its creators do not make. The hypernym/hyponym relationships among the noun synsets can be interpreted as specialization relations among conceptual categories. In other words, WordNet can be interpreted and used as a lexical ontology in the computer science sense. However, such an ontology should be corrected before being used, because it contains hundreds of basic semantic inconsistencies; for example there are, (i) common specializations for exclusive categories and (ii) redundancies in the specialization hierarchy. Furthermore, transforming WordNet into a lexical ontology usable for knowledge representation should normally also involve (i) distinguishing the specialization relations into \"subtypeOf\" and \"instanceOf\" relations, and (ii) associating intuitive unique identifiers to each category. Although such corrections and transformations have been performed and documented as part of the integration of WordNet 1.7 into the cooperatively updatable knowledge base of WebKB-2, most projects claiming to re-use WordNet for knowledge-based applications (typically, knowledge-oriented information retrieval) simply re-use it directly.\n\nWordNet has also been converted to a formal specification, by means of a hybrid bottom-up top-down methodology to automatically extract association relations from WordNet, and interpret these associations in terms of a set of conceptual relations, formally defined in the DOLCE foundational ontology.\n\nIn most works that claim to have integrated WordNet into ontologies, the content of WordNet has not simply been corrected when it seemed necessary; instead, WordNet has been heavily re-interpreted and updated whenever suitable. This was the case when, for example, the top-level ontology of WordNet was re-structured according to the OntoClean based approach or when WordNet was used as a primary source for constructing the lower classes of the SENSUS ontology.\n\nWordNet does not include information about the etymology or the pronunciation of words and it contains only limited information about usage. WordNet aims to cover most of everyday English and does not include much domain-specific terminology.\n\nWordNet is the most commonly used computational lexicon of English for word sense disambiguation (WSD), a task aimed to assigning the context-appropriate meanings (i.e. synset members) to words in a text. However, it has been argued that WordNet encodes sense distinctions that are too fine-grained. This issue prevents WSD systems from achieving a level of performance comparable to that of humans, who do not always agree when confronted with the task of selecting a sense from a dictionary that matches a word in a context. The granularity issue has been tackled by proposing clustering methods that automatically group together similar senses of the same word.\n\nSome wordnets were subsequently created for other languages. A 2012 survey lists the wordnets and their availability. In an effort to propagate the usage of WordNets, the Global WordNet community had been slowly re-licensing their WordNets to an open domain where researchers and developers can easily access and use WordNets as language resources to provide ontological and lexical knowledge in Natural Language Processing tasks.\n\nThe Open Multilingual WordNet provides access to open licensed wordnets in a variety of languages, all linked to the Princeton Wordnet of English (PWN). The goal is to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple languages.\n\nWordNet has been used for a number of purposes in information systems, including word-sense disambiguation, information retrieval, automatic text classification, automatic text summarization, machine translation and even automatic crossword puzzle generation.\n\nA common use of WordNet is to determine the similarity between words. Various algorithms have been proposed, including measuring the distance among words and synsets in WordNet's graph structure, such as by counting the number of edges among synsets. The intuition is that the closer two words or synsets are, the closer their meaning. A number of WordNet-based word similarity algorithms are implemented in a Perl package called WordNet::Similarity, and in a Python package called NLTK. Other more sophisticated WordNet-based similarity techniques include ADW, whose implementation is available in Java. WordNet can also be used to inter-link other vocabularies.\n\nPrinceton maintains a list of related projects that includes links to some of the widely used application programming interfaces available for accessing WordNet using various programming languages and environments.\n\nWordNet is connected to several databases of the Semantic Web. WordNet is also commonly re-used via mappings between the WordNet synsets and the categories from ontologies. Most often, only the top-level categories of WordNet are mapped.\n\nThe Global WordNet Association (GWA) is a public and non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and connecting wordnets for all languages in the world. The GWA also promotes the standardization of wordnets across languages, to ensure its uniformity in enumerating the synsets in human languages. The GWA keeps a list of wordnets developed around the world.\n\n\n\n\nWordNet Database is distributed as a dictionary package (usually a single file) for the following software:\n\n\n"}
