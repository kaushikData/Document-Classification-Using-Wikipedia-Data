For subscription distribution services, a la carte pricing contrasts with the prevailing model of bundling, in which channels are grouped into packages that are offered on an all-or-nothing basis. The term has subsequently been applied to cord cutting—the practice of relying on television services that are streamed over the internet.\n\nA la carte pricing has been an often-requested but seldom-delivered option for cable and satellite distribution services. In the U.S., proponents have argued that the model would deliver lower prices, while opponents maintain that bundling offers more customer value and program diversity.\n\nIn Canada, a la carte service has been required by law since December 2016. The legislation dates back to at least 2012 when the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) ruled that consumers should be able to subscribe to individual channels, but the fewer channels purchased, the higher the cost for each one. No timeline was set. In October 2013, Industry Minister James Moore said that Canadians \"shouldn't have to pay for bundled television channels they don't watch\" and indicated that the country's Conservative government would make it easier for subscribers to purchase channels individually.\n\nOn December 1, 2016, as per policy implemented by the CRTC on March 19, 2015, all television providers in Canada were required to offer an a la carte scheme. Channels were typically priced between $4 and $7, making bundled packages the better deal for all but the most frugal subscribers. Consumers were incredulous about the offerings, but analysts were not surprised, arguing that the industry would be expected to protect its bottom line. While the CRTC required a basic offering of local television services and mandated channels costing $25 or less, it did not regulate the pricing of individual stations.\n\nIn the United States, the precedent for distributors bundling channels, rather than offering them a la carte, began shortly after passage of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which enabled broadcasters to seek compensation from distributors in exchange for retransmitting a signal. Larger broadcasters negotiated not for higher fees, but for inclusion of their newer, lesser known, non-terrestrial channels. Fox, for example, obtained distribution for FX; NBC for CNBC. Hence, bundling has not been just a marketing choice for distributors, but a contractual obligation.\n\nIndustry resistance to a la carte programming in the U.S. has been entrenched even during downturns. In 2011, for example, a combined loss of 1.2 million subscribers to Comcast and Time Warner Cable prompted rumors that program distributors themselves would push to unbundle at least some of their services. Cable analyst Craig Moffett argued that a modified a la carte model, consisting of smaller programming tiers, was more economically feasible for distributors and customers alike. At the time, Time Warner Cable experimented with such an offering in a limited trial, called TV Essentials. IDC analyst Gary Ireland called such skinny bundles \"simply a placeholder for a la carte\" and predicted that consummer demand for the pricing scheme would eventually triumph. At the end of 2015, 20.4% of U.S. households had either dropped cable service or never subscribed in the first place.\n\nThe case for a la carte has centered on cost savings for subscribers. In 2006, Kevin Martin, then chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and one of the best known advocates for the pricing scheme, presented a report to Congress arguing that, on average, consumers would save 13% on their monthly cable subscription rates if they were able to subscribe only to channels that they actually watched.\n\nIn May 2013, U.S. Senator John McCain introduced legislation that would have encouraged, through regulatory incentives, programmers and distributors to offer a la carte services. He cited an FCC survey finding that the cost of expanded basic cable has effectively risen from about US$25 a month in 1995 to over $54, greatly exceeding inflation. As predicted at the time by observers and McCain himself, the legislation did not pass.\n\nOpposition to a la carte programming has centered in part on program diversity. When channels are bundled into large subscription tiers, less popular niche channels are more likely to survive because their cost is borne by both viewers and non-viewers, alike. In 2008, the National Congress of Black Women and fourteen other groups argued that case in a letter to the FCC, writing that a la carte pricing would \"wreak havoc\" on programming diversity. Televangelist Jerry Falwell opposed a la carte pricing for similar reasons, fearing that the pricing model would force Christian broadcasters off the air, although not all religious broadcasters agreed.\n\nA la carte opponents have also cited economics, arguing that the perceived cost savings of a la carte pricing would be illusory for most subscribers and dramatically reduce revenues for programmers. A December 2013 analysis of the U.S. market by investment bank and asset management firm Needham & Company concluded an a la carte scheme would cut $80 billion to $113 billion of consumer value from the industry, cost at least $45 billion in advertising, and eliminate at least 124 channels and some 1.4 million media-related jobs. The firm based its estimates on the assumption that the average annual operating cost of an entertainment cable channel is $280 million, which would require at least 165,000 viewers to break even. Based on 2012 viewership, that would leave about 56 channels standing. Analyst Laura Martin recommended that the current business model of bundled tiered subscriptions be kept with no changes.\n\nIn a May 2014 \"New York Times\" column, Josh Barro pointed to academic research concluding that an a la carte system would not benefit customers. A typical subscriber, he wrote, would pay \"\"slightly more\" on cable under an unbundled system, while watching slightly fewer channels.\" A 2011 Stanford University study cited by Barro simulated a 49-channel subscription bundle being switched to an la carte scheme. The researchers concluded that subscribers would pay 103.0% more in fees passed on by distributors, while consumer welfare would likely be worse, changing between -5.4% and 0.2%. Part of the reason is efficiency: some distribution costs are fixed whether a distributor provides a few channels or many. If fewer people subscribe, the base subscription rate is likely to go up. In addition, programmers would receive less revenue in carriage fees and advertising revenues, and would look to its remaining viewers to make up the difference. However, some subscribers would benefit from a la carte, including those who have opted out of bundled channels, but might subscribe to just a few, as well as subscribers with no interest in sports. Casual sports fans, on the other hand, could pay a higher rate.\n\nBy 2013, the outsized cost of sports programming paid by distributors and passed on to subscribers had influenced the debate. The Needham study maintained that the creation of a separate sports tier would reduce industry revenues by $13 billion. Cable pioneer John C. Malone stated that, for subscribers uninterested in television sports, \"runaway sports rights\" costs amounted to \"a high tax\".\n\nThe most pronounced example was the national sports network ESPN, whose monthly per-subscriber fee charged to distributors in 2013 averaged $5.54, more than four times that of the second most costly national network. According to a report in \"The New York Times\", many subscribers paid for ESPN through bundled subscriptions, but did not watch it. Of the 100 million households in the United States, just 1.36 million people viewed ESPN in prime time during the second quarter of 2013. ESPN and its majority parent, The Walt Disney Company, called bundling a great value and a force for program diversity, and argued that without bundling, ESPN's monthly fee would rise to $15. But fortunes subsequently changed for the network, which lost 10 million subscribers. The network went through two rounds of lay-offs, including some 50 broadcasters in April 2017. Analysts saw those moves as part of a shift in how ESPN distributes its programming, including the expected launch of a subscription streaming service: the functional equivalent of an a la carte channel.\n\nRegional sports networks sold as part of bundled tiers were also a source of controversy. A notable example was Time Warner Cable's agreement to pay the Los Angeles Dodgers $8.35 billion over 25 years to exclusively carry the team's games on a jointly owned television outlet, SportsNet LA (since renamed Spectrum SportsNet LA), with the intent of reselling rights to other regional distributors. The largest satellite provider, DirecTV, offered to carry the channel on an la carte basis, arguing that SportsNet LA was most expensive of five regional sports networks and that a bundled offering would unfairly burden the company's subscribers. TWC responded that bundled sports channels were an industry standard, one that DirecTV itself adhered to in other markets. As of the end of the 2017 season, the dispute resulted in Dodgers game telecasts being unavailable to the majority of Southern California households for four consecutive seasons.\n\nIn India, terrestrial and free-to-air television is free with no monthly payments, while cable, direct to home (DTH) and IPTV require a monthly payment that varies depending on how many channels a subscriber chooses to pay for. Channels are sold in packages/bouquets/bundles or a la carte. All television service providers are required, by law, to provide a la carte selection of channels. India is the first country in the world to couple a la carte pricing with a price cap. Multiple-system operator (MSO) Hathway was the first to offer channels on an a la carte basis in India, announcing such a service on September 3, 2003.\n\nOn September 3, 2007, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable Services) Interconnection (Fourth Amendment) Regulation 2007, which went into law on December 1; the rules require all broadcasters to offer channels on an a la carte basis. The regulation states, \"All broadcasters will compulsorily offer all their channels on a la carte basis to DTH operators. Additionally, they may also offer bouquets, but they will not compel any DTH operator to include the entire bouquet in any package being offered by DTH operators to their subscribers\". Prior to the regulation, only customers in areas covered by the conditional access system (CAS), and cable systems providing the services, had the option of choosing to buy only the channels they were interested in. TRAI intervened after DTH operators complained that broadcasters were forcing them to carry channels that they did not want. In the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Services (Second) Tariff (Eighth Amendment) Order, 2007 (a revision of the earlier regulation issued on October 4, 2007), broadcasters were ordered to offer all channels on an a la carte basis to cable providers. Like the earlier regulation concerning DTH operators, this order took effect on December 1, 2007. It also permitted packages to be offered along with a la carte.\n\nSeveral broadcasters, such as STAR India, Zee Turner, Set Discovery and Sun TV, challenged TRAI's order in the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). On January 15, 2008, TDSAT refused to grant a stay on the appeal challenging TRAI's directive; TDSAT overruled the broadcasters' objections. The agency later set aside TRAI's December 2007 tariff regime. TRAI challenged TDSAT's order in the Supreme Court, and stated in proceedings on July 22, 2010 that \"in the analog, non-addressable environment, the authority is of the view that a la carte should not be made mandatory at the wholesale level as technological constraints in any case make it impossible for the benefits of a la carte provisioning to be passed on to subscribers\".\n\nTRAI ordered that pay television customers in India must be given a free choice of channels rather than be forced to choose package deals, enforcing a January 2011 deadline to implement the changes. The order stated, \"Every service provider providing broadcasting services or cable services to its subscribers using an addressable system shall offer all pay channels to its subscribers on a la carte basis and shall specify the maximum retail price for each pay channel\". Tata Sky, Airtel digital TV, Videocon d2h, In Digital and Reliance Digital TV launched a la carte options in January 2011.\n\nWhile the discussion of \"a la carte\" services initially centered on cable and satellite services, the term has also been used in relation to cord cutting—the practice of using internet television services such as Amazon Video and Netflix as an alternative to traditional subscription television services. In this context, a la carte refers to a customer subscribing to individual services, as opposed to purchasing costlier bundles of service from a traditional television provider. To appeal to these customers and expand the availability of their content beyond \"linear\" television, broadcasters such as CBS, HBO, and Showtime have launched streaming services, including CBS All Access and HBO Now. These services feature their networks' respective content on-demand, and are purchased as a standalone service independent of television providers. \n\nAmazon Video added its own a la carte \"Channels\" platform to its service in 2015, which allows users to subscribe to third-party content services delivered on top of the base Amazon Prime service; by 2018, it offered 140 different services, including CBS All Access, Showtime, and Starz.\n\nDespite having used the term \"A la carte\" in promotion, Sling TV is not a true a la carte television service, as it is still distributed in bundles, customers cannot pick and choose individual channels to include in their service or swap them out for different ones individually, and some packages are only available on specific service tiers. The service cited the practice of mandatory bundling by broadcasters as an influence on this policy.\n\n\n"}

Informally, an acceptor is a device with a finite state control, a finite number of input symbols, and an internal store with a read and write function. Each acceptor has a start state and a set of accepting states. The device reads a sequence of symbols, transitioning from state to state for each input symbol. If the device ends in an accepting state, the device is said to accept the sequence of symbols. A family of acceptors is a set of acceptors with the same type of internal store. The study of AFA is part of AFL (abstract families of languages) theory. \n\nAn \"AFA Schema\" is an ordered 4-tuple formula_1, where\n\nAn \"abstract family of acceptors (AFA)\" is an ordered pair formula_31 such that:\nFor a given acceptor, let formula_67 be the relation on formula_68 defined by: For formula_69 in formula_70, formula_71 if there exists a formula_72 and formula_73 such that formula_72 is in formula_11, formula_76 is in formula_77 and formula_78. Let formula_79 denote the transitive closure of formula_67.\nLet formula_31 be an AFA and formula_46 = (formula_47, formula_48, formula_49, formula_50, formula_51) be in formula_46. Define formula_89 to be the set formula_90. For each subset formula_91 of formula_45, let formula_93.\nDefine formula_94 to be the set formula_95. For each subset formula_91 of formula_45, let formula_98.\n\nAn AFA schema defines a store or memory with read and write function. The symbols in formula_2 are called \"storage symbols\" and the symbols in formula_3 are called \"instructions\". The write function formula_4 returns a new storage state given the current storage state and an instruction. The read function formula_6 returns the current state of memory. Condition (3) insures the empty storage configuration is distinct from other configurations. Condition (4) requires there be an identity instruction that allows the state of memory to remain unchanged while the acceptor changes state or advances the input. Condition (5) assures that the set of storage symbols for any given acceptor is finite.\n\nAn AFA is the set of all acceptors over a given pair of state and input alphabets which have the same storage mechanism defined by a given AFA schema. The formula_67 relation defines one step in the operation of an acceptor. formula_94 is the set of words accepted by acceptor formula_46 by having the acceptor enter an accepting state. formula_89 is the set of words accepted by acceptor formula_46 by having the acceptor simultaneously enter an accepting state and having an empty storage.\n\nThe abstract acceptors defined by AFA are generalizations of other types of acceptors (e.g. finite state automata, pushdown automata, etc.). They have a finite state control like other automata, but their internal storage may vary widely from the stacks and tapes used in classical automata.\n\nThe main result from AFL theory is that a family of languages formula_108 is a full AFL if and only if formula_109 for some AFA formula_31. Equally important is the result that formula_108 is a full semi-AFL if and only if formula_112 for some AFA formula_31.\n\nSeymour Ginsburg of the University of Southern California and Sheila Greibach of Harvard University first presented their AFL theory paper at the IEEE Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory in 1967. \n"}

The first president, Machado de Assis, declared its foundation on December 15, 1896, with the by-laws being passed on January 28, 1897. On July 20 of the same year, the academy entered into operation.\n\nThe Brazilian Academy of Letters is, according to its statutes, charged with the care of the \"national language\" of Brazil (the Portuguese language) and with the promotion of Brazilian literary arts. The academy is considered the foremost institution devoted to the Portuguese language in Brazil. Although it is not a state institution and no law grants to it oversight over the language, by its prestige and technical qualification it is the paramount authority on Brazilian Portuguese. The academy's main publication in this field is the Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language (\"Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa\") of which there were five editions. The \"Vocabulary\" is prepared by the academy's Commission on Lexicology and Lexicography. If a word is not included in the \"Vocabulary\", it is considered not to exist as a correct word in Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nThe academy is composed to this day of 40 members, known as \"immortals\", chosen from among the citizens of Brazil, who have published recognized works or books of literary value. The position of \"immortal\" is awarded for the recipient's lifetime. New members are admitted by a vote of the academy members when one of the \"chairs\" become vacant. The chairs are numbered and each has a Patron: the Patrons are 40 great Brazilian writers that were already dead when the academy was founded; the names of the Patrons were chosen by the Founders and they were honored \"post mortem\" by each being assigned patronage over a chair. Thus, each of the 40 chairs is associated with its current holder, with the predecessors of the current holder who occupied it before him, and, in particular, with the Founder who occupied it first, but also with the seat's Patron.\n\nThe academicians use formal gala gilded uniforms with a sword (the uniform is called \"fardão\") when participating in official meetings of the academy.\n\nThe initiative was taken by , concretized in preparatory meetings that began on 15 December 1896 under the presidency of Machado de Assis (elected by acclamation) in the writing of the \"Brazilian Journal\". At these meetings, the statutes of the Brazilian Academy of Letters were approved on 28 January 1897, and its membership of forty founding members was approved. On 20 July of that year, the inaugural session was held at the \"Pedagogium\"'s facility in the center of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWithout having their own headquarters or financial resources, the meetings of the academy were held in the premises of the former National Gymnasium, in the Noble Hall of the Ministry of the Interior, in the hall of the Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading, especially for the solemn sessions. The joint sessions were held at the First Secretary's law office, Rodrigo Octávio, at Quitanda Street, 47.\n\nFrom 1904, the academy obtained the left wing of the Brazilian Silogeo, a governmental building that housed other cultural institutions, where it remained until the conquest of its own headquarters.\n\nIn 1923, thanks to the initiative of its president at the time, Afrânio Peixoto and the French ambassador, Raymond Conty, the French government donated to the academy the building of the French Pavilion, built for the Independence of Brazil's Centenary International Exposition, a replica of the Petit Trianon of Versailles, erected by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, between 1762 and 1768.\n\nThese facilities have been registered by the State Institute of Cultural Heritage (INEPAC), of the Municipal Secretary of Culture of Rio de Janeiro, since 9 November 1987. Its halls continue to the present day hosting regular meetings, solemn sessions commemorative meetings, the inauguration sessions of the new academics, as well as the traditional tea on Thursdays. They can be known by the public on guided tours or on cultural programs such as chamber music concerts, member book launches, conference cycles and plays.\n\nOn the first floor of the building, in the Hall, stands the decorated marble floor, a French crystal chandelier, a large white porcelain vase from Sèvres and four English bas-reliefs. Among other dependencies, the following stand out:\n\n\nOn the second floor there is the Tea Room, where the academics meet, on Thursdays, before the Plenary Session, the Sessions Room and the Library. The latter attends scholars and researchers, especially the collection of Manuel Bandeira.\n\nDuring periods like the Vargas' totalitarian dictatorship or the Brazilian military government, the academy's neutrality in choosing proper members dedicated to the literary profession was compromised when it elected politicians with few or no contributions to literature, such as ex-president and dictator Getúlio Vargas in 1943. The academy, which was a purely male affair until the groundbreaking election of novelist Rachel de Queiroz in 1977 for chair No. 5, now has four women members (10% of its total membership), one of which, Nélida Piñon, served as president in 1996–97.\n\nThe academy, thanks to revenues in excess of $4 million a year, is financially stable. It owns a skyscraper with 28 floors (\"Palácio Austregésilo de Athaide\"), in the center of Rio, which the academy rents for office space, generating 70% of its current revenue. The rest comes from rental of other buildings, which were legated by book editor Francisco Alves, in 1917, and from financial investments. This comfortable situation allows for paying a \"jeton\" to each academician. The ABL is located just by its side, in a neoclassical building, which is named \"Petit Trianon\". It was donated by the government of France in 1923 and is so named because it is a copy of the Petit Trianon palace in Versailles, near Paris, France.\n\nIt has recently inaugurated one of the largest public libraries in Rio, with 90,000 volumes and a multimedia center.\n\nThe academy annually awards several literary prizes: the Prêmio Machado de Assis (the most important literature prize in the country, awarded for lifework), and the ABL prizes for poetry, for fiction and drama, for essays, critic and history of the literature, and for children's literature. Sometimes, an extraordinary commemorative prize is also awarded, such as the José Lins do Rego prize, in 2001, and the Afonso Arinos prize, in 2005.\n\nThe academy also publishes a literary periodical, the Brazilian Review (\"Revista Brasileira\"), with quarterly editions.\n\nThe academy's main publication in this field is the \"Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language\" (\"Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa\") of which there were five editions. The \"Vocabulary\" is prepared by the academy's Commission on Lexicology and Lexicography. If a word is not included in the \"Vocabulary\", it is considered not to exist as a correct word in Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nThe \"Orthographic Vocabulary\", however, is not a dictionary, as it contains words and their grammatical categories, but not the definition or meaning of the words listed. Thus, unlike the French Academy, the Royal Spanish Academy and other foreign institutions dedicated with the care of a national language, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, until recently, published no official dictionary. Although it still stopped short of publishing a full official dictionary, the academy issued its first dictionary in 2009, the School Dictionary of the Portuguese Language (\"Dicionário Escolar da Língua Portuguesa\"), with students as its target customers.\n\nThe academy does plan to publish a full and official Dictionary of the Brazilian Academy of Letters in the future. For the time being, however, other dictionaries such as the \"Aurélio\" and the \"Houaiss\" remain more prestigious than the \"School Dictionary\", in spite of the fact that the latter is sometimes marketed by booksellers as the \"ABL's Dictionary\", due to its being authored by the academy. Both the \"Houaiss\" and the \"Aurélio\" Dictionaries, however, were first compiled by members of the academy (Antônio Houaiss and Aurélio Buarque de Holanda Ferreira, respectively) in their private capacities and as personal professional enterprises. The preparation of an official dictionary of the Portuguese language is a stated goal of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.\n\nThe members of the Brazilian Academy of Letters (October 2014):\n\n\n\n"}

Advertisements are developed, designed and provided with text by creative people of advertising agencies, but they cannot be found in any state-archive. \nUntil the end of 1990 in Germany only Stefan Rögener with his company AdFinder in Hamburg and Marien Riepelmeier in connection with the BBDO Düsseldorf archived advertisements in an extensive way and offered them to advertising agencies for research, because for the creation of new advertising campaigns it is important to know former advertising for the same product by different providers and how competitors currently advertise the product. \n1998 the archive AdFinder rapidly became too small and Stefan Rögener and Peter Karow had the, at that time rakish, idea to digitalize advertisements and offer them via internet. This could do away with the limited space and guarantee great up-to-dateness and availability. They found an innovative business management at the GWA headquarter (German Association of Communication Agencies) and concluded a cooperation agreement about the future online use of the archive with the GWA. In the same year they founded the company AdVision digital GmbH in Hamburg. \n\nThe AdZyklopädie provides advertising in printed media since 1947 and TV advertisements since 1970. It is almost not possible to explore the history of advertising beyond 1947, because there are no generally available digital collections. Now, at the beginning of 2017, the archive contains more than 6.5 million advertising campaigns and the 50 employees of AdVision regularly archive about 1,500 national and international titles from public and professional journals, 100 daily newspapers and 75 TV stations – approximately 70,000 advertising campaigns per month. So the AdZyklopädie is the biggest archive for advertising campaigns in Germany. Thanks to the huge amount of stored criteria nowadays it is even possible to explore the relative importance of a campaign according to different criteria like diversification, effects, costs and media.\n\nThe online archive is especially available to advertising agencies and advertisers via a research subscription. For competition monitoring the AdZyklopädie especially allows \"investigating media and schematic plans\" as well as \"spendings\" of individual companies or branches.\n\nFor each advertising campaign the following search criteria are stored:; \n\nbranch, segment, product group, company, brand, product, date, type of media, medium, advertising expenses, design code, credits, slogans/claims, full-text\n\nThe design code permits to categorize (category, aspect, element) 700 creative aspects or aspects regarding content and supplement them with details worth knowing like ADC (Art Directors Club) Awards, Cannes Lions or Clio Awards. Design code categories are architecture, food/drinks, objects, geography, culture/art, landscape, people, plants/animals, sports/free time, textures/typography. \nThe \"credits\" contain the doers behind the advertising campaigns like director, consultant, film production, cameraman, etc. \n\nSlogans/Claims are separately stored in the field of print advertisements.\n\nFurthermore, the continuous text of print advertisements is archived for full-text search. Editorial texts of journals and newspapers are read and searched by the frequency of special product denominations. Storylines are stored for a selection of TV and radio spots. \n\nStudents and teachers of graphic design can use the data free of charge, but have to register with AdVision. The contents of the AdZyklopädie are also used by professors for graphic design in scientific thesis.\n"}

Business increased dramatically in the 1950s when television returned to the Federal Republic of Germany, known also as West Germany prior to the German reunification of 1990.\n\nBetween the 60s and 80s, theatre popularity began to decline, whereas television popularity increased. With the introduction of magnetic tapes, this gave Lüdecke ample opportunity to take advantage of the surge in Hollywood success by producing German language versions of worldwide box-office hits.\nIn 1987, Lüdecke passed ownership of the company to his son, Wolfram.

He is famous for the poem \"Meus oito anos\".\n\nHe is patron of the 6th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.\n\nCasimiro de Abreu was born on January 4, 1839, in the city of Barra de São João (renamed \"Casimiro de Abreu\" in his honor in 1925), to rich Portuguese farmers José Joaquim Marques de Abreu and Luísa Joaquina das Neves. He received only a basic education at Instituto Freeze, in Nova Friburgo, where he met and befriended Pedro Luís Pereira de Sousa. Following orders of his father, he moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1852 to dedicate himself to commerce, an activity which he hated.\n\nWith his father, he travelled to Portugal in 1853. There he began his literary career, writing for many newspapers (such as \"O Progresso\" and \"Ilustração Luso-Brasileira\") and collaborating with Alexandre Herculano and Luís Augusto Rebelo da Silva, among others. During his stay in Portugal, he wrote his first works: the theater play \"Camões e o Jau\" (influenced by Almeida Garrett's poem \"Camões\"), the novel \"Carolina\", published under \"feuilleton\" form, and the first chapters of a novel which he would never finish: \"Camila\".\n\nIn 1857, he returned to Rio, where he became a collaborator for the newspapers \"A Marmota\", \"O Espelho\", \"Revista Popular\" and \"Correio Mercantil\". While working for the latter, he met Manuel Antônio de Almeida and Machado de Assis.\n\nIn 1859, he published his most famous work, the poetry book \"As Primaveras\" (\"Springtimes\"). Its publication was financed by his father, although he disapproved Casimiro's literary vocation.\n\nSuffering from tuberculosis, Casimiro moved to Nova Friburgo in order to recover, but he died at age 21 on October 18, 1860.\n\n\n"}

It is the most used linguistic variety of a language, the language normally used in conversation and other informal communication.\n\nA specific instance of such language is called a \"colloquialism\". The most common term used in dictionaries to label such an expression is colloquial.\n\nGeneral parlance is distinct from formal speech or formal writing. It is the variety of language that speakers typically use when they are relaxed and not especially self-conscious. An expression is labeled \"colloq.\" for \"colloquial\" in dictionaries when a different expression is more common in formal speech, but this does not mean that the colloquial expression is inappropriate in formal speech or writing or that it is necessarily slang. Many people misunderstand this very common dictionary label due to the widespread misconception that \"colloquial\" means \"location\" or a word being \"regional\". This is not the case; the word root for \"colloquial\" is related to locution, not location. \n\nSome colloquial speech contains a great deal of slang, but some contains no slang at all. Slang is permitted in colloquial language, but it is not a necessary element. Other examples of colloquial usage in English include contractions or profanity.\n\nIn the philosophy of language, \"colloquial language\" is ordinary natural language, as distinct from specialized forms used in logic or other areas of philosophy. In the field of logical atomism, meaning is evaluated in a different way than with more formal propositions.\n\nA colloquial name or familiar name is a name or term commonly used to identify a person or thing in informal language, in place of another usually more formal or technical name.\n\nColloquialisms are distinct from slang or jargon. Slang refers to words used only by specific social groups, such as teenagers or soldiers. Colloquial language may include slang, but consists mostly of contractions or other informal words and phrases known to most native speakers of the language.\n\nJargon is terminology that is especially defined in relationship to a specific activity, profession, or group. The term refers to the language used by people who work in a particular area or who have a common interest. Much like slang, it is a kind of shorthand used to express ideas that are frequently discussed between members of a group, though it can also be developed deliberately using chosen terms. While a standard term may be given a more precise or unique usage amongst practitioners of relevant disciplines, it is often reported that jargon is a barrier to communication for those people unfamiliar with the respective field.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55968271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55968271", "title": "Conversational user interfaces", "text": "Conversational user interfaces\n\nConversational interfaces (CUI) are platforms that mimic a conversation with a real human. Historically, computers have relied on graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as the user pressing a “back” button to translate the user’s desired action into commands the computer understands. While an effective mechanism of completing computing actions, there is a learning curve for the user associated with GUI. Instead, CUI’s provide opportunity for the user to communicate with the computer in their natural language rather than in a syntax specific commands. \n\nTo do this, conversational interfaces use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to allow computers to understand, analyze and create meaning from human language. Unlike word processors, NLP considers the structure to human language (i.e. Words make a phrase, phrases make sentences which convey the idea or intent the user is trying to invoke). The ambiguous nature of human language makes it difficult for a machine to always correctly interpret the user’s requests, which is why we have seen a shift towards Natural Language Understanding (NLU). \n\nNLU allows for sentiment analysis and conversational searches which allows a line of questioning to continue, with the context carried throughout the conversation. NLU allows conversational interfaces to handle unstructured inputs that the human brain is able to understand such as spelling mistakes of follow-up questions . For example, through leveraging NLU, a user could first ask for the population of the United States. If the user then asks “Who is the president”, the search will carry forward the context of the United States and provide the appropriate response.\n\nConversational interfaces have emerged as a tool for businesses to efficiently provide consumers with relevant information, in a cost effective manner. CUI provide ease of access to relevant, contextual information to the end user without the complexities and learning curve typically associated with technology.\n\nWhile there are a variety of interface brands, to date, there are two main categories of conversational interfaces; voice assistants and chatbots.\n\nVoice assistants are interfaces that allow a user to complete an action simply by speaking a command. Introduced in October 2011, Apple’s Siri was one of the first voice assistants widely adopted. Siri allowed users of iPhone to get information and complete actions on their device simply by asking Siri.\nFurther development has continued since Siri’s introduction to include home based devices such as Google Home or Amazon Echo (powered by Alexa) that allow users to “connect” their homes through a series of smart devices to further the options of tangible actions they can complete. Users can now turn off the lights, set reminders and call their friends all with a verbal queue. \n\nThese conversational interfaces that utilize a voice assistant have become an efficient and popular way for businesses to interact with their customers as the interface removes the typical friction in a customer journey. Customers no longer need to remember a long list of usernames and passwords to their various accounts; they simply link each account to Google or Amazon once, and gone are the days where you needed to wait on hold for an hour to ask a simple question. \n\nChatbots are web or mobile based interfaces that allow the user to ask questions and retrieve information. This information can be generic in nature such as the Google Assistant chat window that allows for internet searches, or it can be a specific brand or service which allows the user to gain information about the status of their various accounts. Their backend systems work in the same manner as a voice assistant, with the front end utilizing a visual interface to convey information. This visual interface can be beneficial for companies that need to do more complex business transactions with customers, as instructions, deep links and graphics can all be utilized to convey an answer. The complexity to which a chatbot answers questions depends on the development of the back end. Chatbots with hard-coded answers has a smaller base on information and corresponding skills. Chatbots that leverage machine learning will continue to grow and develop larger content bases for more complex responses . \n\nMore frequently, companies are leveraging chatbots as a way to offload simple questions and transactions from human agents. These chatbots provide the option to assist a user, but then directly transfer the customer to a live agent within the same chat window if the conversation becomes too complex.\n"}

{"id": "8439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8439", "title": "Diacritic", "text": "Diacritic\n\nA diacritic – also diacritical mark, diacritical point, diacritical sign, or accent – is a glyph added to a letter, or basic glyph. The term derives from the Ancient Greek (\"diakritikós\", \"distinguishing\"), from (\"diakrī́nō\", \"to distinguish\"). \"Diacritic\" is primarily an adjective, though sometimes used as a noun, whereas \"diacritical\" is only ever an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the acute ( ´ ) and grave ( ` ), are often called \"accents\". Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.\n\nThe main use of diacritical marks in the Latin script is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added. Examples are the diaereses in the borrowed French words \"naïve\" and \"Noël\", which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding vowel; the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced, as in \"saké\" and poetic \"breathèd\"; and the cedilla under the \"c\" in the borrowed French word \"façade\", which shows it is pronounced rather than . In other Latin-script alphabets, they may distinguish between homonyms, such as the French \"là\" (\"there\") versus \"la\" (\"the\") that are both pronounced . In Gaelic type, a dot over a consonant indicates lenition of the consonant in question.\n\nIn other alphabetic systems, diacritical marks may perform other functions. Vowel pointing systems, namely the Arabic harakat (  etc.) and the Hebrew niqqud (  etc.) systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet. The Indic virama ( ् etc.) and the Arabic sukūn (  ) mark the absence of vowels. Cantillation marks indicate prosody. Other uses include the Early Cyrillic titlo stroke ( ◌҃ ) and the Hebrew gershayim (  ), which, respectively, mark abbreviations or acronyms, and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as numerals. In the Hanyu Pinyin official romanization system for Chinese, diacritics are used to mark the tones of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur.\n\nIn orthography and collation, a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter–diacritic combination. This varies from language to language, and may vary from case to case within a language. English is the only major modern European language requiring no diacritics for native words (although a diaeresis may be used in words such as \"coöperation\").\n\nIn some cases, letters are used as \"in-line diacritics\", with the same function as ancillary glyphs, in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them, as in the case of the \"h\" in the English pronunciation of \"sh\" and \"th\".\n\nAmong the types of diacritic used in alphabets based on the Latin script are:\n\nThe tilde, dot, comma, titlo, apostrophe, bar, and colon are sometimes diacritical marks, but also have other uses.\n\nNot all diacritics occur adjacent to the letter they modify. In the Wali language of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects \"’Bulengee\" and \"’Dolimi\". Because of vowel harmony, all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In abugida scripts, like those used to write Hindi and Thai, diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.\n\nThe tittle (dot) on the letter \"i\" of the Latin alphabet originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish \"i\" from the minims (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It first appeared in the 11th century in the sequence \"ii\" (as in \"ingeníí)\", then spread to \"i\" adjacent to \"m, n, u\", and finally to all lowercase \"i\"'s. The \"j\", originally a variant of \"i\", inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of Roman type it was reduced to the round dot we have today.\n\n\nThese diacritics are used in addition to the acute, grave, and circumflex accents and the diaeresis:\n\n\nThe diacritics >〮 and 〯  , known as Bangjeom (), were used to mark pitch accents in Hangul for Middle Korean. They were written to the left of a syllable in vertical writing and above a syllable in horizontal writing.\n\nThe South Korean government officially revised the romanization of the Korean language in July 2000 to eliminate diacritics.\n\n\nIn addition to the above vowel marks, transliteration of Syriac sometimes includes \"ə\", \"e̊\" or superscript \"\" (or often nothing at all) to represent an original Aramaic schwa that became lost later on at some point in the development of Syriac. Some transliteration schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons.\n\nSome non-alphabetic scripts also employ symbols that function essentially as diacritics.\n\nDifferent languages use different rules to put diacritic characters in alphabetical order. French treats letters with diacritical marks the same as the underlying letter for purposes of ordering and dictionaries.\n\nThe Scandinavian languages, by contrast, treat the characters with diacritics \"ä\", \"ö\" and \"å\" as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after \"z\". Usually \"ä\" is sorted as equal to \"æ\" (ash) and \"ö\" is sorted as equal to \"ø\" (o-slash). Also, \"aa\", when used as an alternative spelling to \"å\", is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that \"ü\" is frequently sorted as \"y\".\n\nLanguages that treat accented letters as variants of the underlying letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. \"schon\" and then \"schön\", or \"fallen\" and then \"fällen\"). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed \"e\"; Austrian phone books now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).\n\nIn Spanish, the grapheme \"ñ\" is considered a new letter different from \"n\" and collated between \"n\" and \"o\", as it denotes a different sound from that of a plain \"n\". But the accented vowels \"á\", \"é\", \"í\", \"ó\", \"ú\" are not separated from the unaccented vowels \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies stress within the word or denotes a distinction between homonyms, and does not modify the sound of a letter.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of the collating orders in various languages, see Collating sequence.\n\nModern computer technology was developed mostly in English-speaking countries, so data formats, keyboard layouts, etc. were developed with a bias favoring English, a language with an alphabet without diacritical marks. This has led some to theorize that the marks and accents may be made obsolete to facilitate the worldwide exchange of data. Efforts have been made to create internationalized domain names that further extend the English alphabet (e.g., \"pokémon.com\").\n\nDepending on the keyboard layout, which differs amongst countries, it is more or less easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Some have their own keys; some are created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark followed by the letter to place it on. Such a key is sometimes referred to as a dead key, as it produces no output of its own but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.\n\nIn modern Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, the keyboard layouts \"US International\" and \"UK International\" feature dead keys that allow one to type Latin letters with the acute, grave, circumflex, diæresis, tilde, and cedilla found in Western European languages (specifically, those combinations found in the ISO Latin-1 character set) directly: \"¨+e\" gives \"ë\", \"~+o\" gives \"õ\", etc. On Apple Macintosh computers, there are keyboard shortcuts for the most common diacritics; Option-\"e\" followed by a vowel places an acute accent, Option-\"u\" followed by a vowel gives an umlaut, option-\"c\" gives a cedilla, etc. Diacritics can be composed in most X Window System keyboard layouts, as well as other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, using additional software.\n\nOn computers, the availability of code pages determines whether one can use certain diacritics. Unicode solves this problem by assigning every known character its own code; if this code is known, most modern computer systems provide a method to input it. With Unicode, it is also possible to combine diacritical marks with most characters.\n\nThe following languages have letters that contain diacritics that are considered independent letters distinct from those without diacritics.\n\n\n\nEnglish is one of the few European languages that does not have many words that contain diacritical marks. Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from French and, increasingly, Spanish; however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from such words. Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include \"café\", \"résumé\" or \"resumé\" (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb \"resume\"), \"soufflé\", and \"naïveté\" (see \"English terms with diacritical marks\"). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers) one may see examples such as \"élite\", \"mêlée\" and \"rôle.\"\n\nEnglish speakers and writers once used the diaeresis more often than now in words such as \"coöperation\" (from Fr. \"coopération\"), \"zoölogy\" (from Grk. \"zoologia\"), and \"seeër\" (now more commonly \"see-er \"or simply\" seer\") as a way of indicating that adjacent vowels belonged to separate syllables, but this practice has become far less common. \"The New Yorker\" magazine is a major publication that continues to use the diaresis in place of a dash for clarity and economy of space.\n\nA few English words, out of context, can only be distinguished from others by a diacritic or modified letter, including exposé, lamé, maté, öre, øre, pâté, and rosé'. The same is true of \"résumé,\" alternately \"\" but nevertheless it is regularly spelled \"resume\". In a few words, diacritics that did not exist in the original have been added for disambiguation, as in maté (from Sp. and Port. \"mate\"), saké (the standard Romanization of the Japanese has no accent mark), and Malé (from Dhivehi މާލެ), to clearly distinguish them from the English words \"mate\", \"sake\", and \"male\".\n\nThe acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (\"rébel\" vs. \"rebél\") or nonstandard for metrical reasons (\"caléndar\"), the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (\"warnèd,\" \"parlìament\").\n\nIn certain personal names such as \"Renée\" and \"Zoë\", often two spellings exist, and the preference will be known only to those close to the person themselves. Even when the name of a person is spelled with a diacritic, like Charlotte Brontë, this may be dropped in English language articles and even official documents such as passports either due to carelessness, the typist not knowing how to enter letters with diacritical marks, or for technical reasons - California, for example, does not allow names with diacritics as the computer system cannot process such characters. They also appear in some worldwide company names and/or trademarks such as Nestlé or Citroën.\n\nThe following languages have letter-diacritic combinations that are not considered independent letters.\n\nSeveral languages that are not written with the Roman alphabet are transliterated, or romanized, using diacritics.

{"id": "8712578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8712578", "title": "Faroese language conflict", "text": "Faroese language conflict\n\nThe Faroese language conflict is a phase in the history of the Faroe Islands in the first half of the 20th century (approx. 1908 to 1938). It was the political and cultural argument between the requirements of the Faroese language in general use, and the Danish language as the official language of the Faroe Islands.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the language of the church, public education, the government, and the law was Danish but Faroese was the language of ordinary people. The orthography of Faroese had been set out by Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb in the middle of the 19th century, and the language had aroused Faroese nationalism since the Christmas Meeting of 1888 or \"Jólafundurin\".\n\nThe conflict was not so much a struggle between the Faroe Islanders and the Danes, but rather among the Faroese themselves. The positions evolved with time.\n\nThe same case can be found in Norway with the Norwegian language conflict between the Norwegian language and the Danish language.\n\nThe two political parties staking out positions on the language conflict were the Union Party (\"Sambandsflokkurin\"), which wanted continued union with Denmark; and the New Self-Government (\"Sjálvstýrisflokkurin\"), which desired independence from Denmark. Later two other political parties which also desired independence from Denmark were created: People's Party (\"Fólkaflokkurin\", a right-wing separatist party) in 1939 and the Republican Party (now Republic, \"Tjóðveldi\", a left-wing separatist party) in 1948. These two parties have also worked for more rights for speakers of the Faroese language.\n\nThe view of the \"Samband\" (unionists) was that the Faroese language should be developed and used in the literary field. However, the Danish language should continue to be the official language of education, which all Faroese should speak and understand. The unionists also opposed the comprehensive introduction of Faroese for the catechism, which they accused \"Sjálvstyri\" of wanting.\n\n\"Samband\" had two major arguments for the use of Danish in education: they said that advanced education was only possible if the Faroese students understood Danish well enough to be able to study in Denmark; and moreover, there were too few Faroese-language school books for the people of the small islands.\n\nThe \"Sjálvstyri\" (separatists) had national sentiment on their side. They regarded it as untenable that the official language could be other than the native language. The party program formulated a core demand that the Faroese language should become the language of instruction in all subjects. At the same time the party tried to use the language conflict to further its separatist goals.\n\nThey had a consistency argument for Faroese as the language of instruction: in the other parts of the Danish kingdom education was conducted in the native language: Icelandic in Iceland, Greenlandic or \"Kalaallisut\" in Greenland, and English in the Danish West Indies (from 1917 the United States Virgin Islands). It was thus a question of equal treatment for all areas under the Danish crown.\n\nHistory worked for the demands of \"Sjálvstyri\". 1908 is considered to be the start of the conflict, which persisted until 1938. In 1908 the teachers of the sixth-form secondary school in Tórshavn (the capital) petitioned the school administration to be allowed to use Faroese in teaching. The administration responded with a partial refusal: Faroese could be used only as an aid, in order to explain certain things. Jákup Dahl, who later became the Provost, was opposed to the administration's ruling and refused to teach in Danish; from then on he taught in Faroese. The school administration referred the issue to the Danish education ministry, which referred it to the \"Løgting\", the Faroese parliament, who could not agree on the issue and in 1910 split into two sides, a majority opinion and a minority opinion. The majority opinion was represented by \"Samband\": Danish was more important as a foreign language than others such as German and English, and the pupils were to hear and speak Danish in all subjects. An important argument for this was that Danish was a key to the higher education in Denmark, and thus was important for the young people's vocational progress.\n\nThe \"Sjálvstyri\" maintained their previous position, that it was natural and understandable that a people should be taught in their native language. But they did not dispute that there were no appropriate teaching materials in Faroese. So they proposed that it should be left to each teacher in which language they taught.\n\nAs a compromise, it was planned that Faroese was to be used as the language of instruction for the younger children. For the older students, fundamental instruction would be in Danish with Faroese permitted as an aid to instruction. On January 16, 1912, this regulation was passed by the Danish government as §7 of the Faroese school regulations.\n\nAlthough it could be rated as a partial success of \"Sjálvstyri\", their demands remained on the agenda of the party after passage of the §7 regulation. Louis Zachariasen in Velbastaður was the first teacher to oppose the regulation openly, and he refused to teach further on Danish. This contravened the regulation that \"Faroese was only to be used as an auxiliary language.\" Zachariasen quit publicly as a teacher and became one of the \"separatist martyrs\".\n\nThe language conflict entered a new phase in 1918, when the question was raised of why Faroese spelling was still not a compulsory subject in the schools. In the above-mentioned school regulations of 1912, this question had been deliberately ignored, since many Faroese teachers did not have sufficient knowledge of the orthography of their native language. However, there were already efforts under way to address this problem, as summer vacation courses in Faroese orthography were being conducted. As the time seemed ripe, the \"Løgting\" requested the Danish government to introduce Faroese spelling as a compulsory subject. The Danish education ministry immediately agreed, but §7 remained unchanged.\n\nThe language conflict became more abstract and it became a matter of a finding suitable formulation for instruction. Efforts were made to find a good way to teach Faroese, while still guaranteeing that the students would have an appropriate knowledge of Danish to further their higher education. The Ministry of Education in Copenhagen suggested in 1925 that Faroese should become the language of general instruction, but Danish should be the language of instruction in geography and history. At that time the party of the \"Samband\" rebelled because they believed that the new rules went too far in separating the Faroese from the Danish. As a result, the majority in the \"Løgting\" rejected the new regulations.\n\nIn the \"Løgting\" elections of 1936, the Social Democratic Party (\"Javnaðarflokkurin\", Social Democratic Party) substantially increased its representation at the expense of the \"Samband\". Together with the Self-Government party, the Social Democrats changed the law to replace the Danish language with Faroese. On December 13, 1938 the Danish government agreed.\n\nSince the Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein in the 16th century, Danish had been the exclusive liturgical language in the Faroese archipelago. Only Danish was used in the People's Church, and this was one of the main reasons why no written tradition in Faroese developed.\n\nIn 1903 Faroese became permitted under certain conditions for use in the church: the communion must take place in Danish, and Faroese could be used to preach only if all church authorities, the Provost and local council agreed. From 1912 the communion service could be held in Faroese, but only if the bishop gave his consent beforehand.\n\nFaroese Islanders achieved a general penetration of their first language as the church language. Most of the faithful conservatively associated the Danish language firmly with the liturgy, with the hymns, and not least with the Bible. Even today certain Faroese church songs are still sung gladly in the old Danish. In Tórshavn an opinion poll was taken, and the majority of the churchgoers expressed a desire for the retention of Danish in church.\n\nNevertheless, the question was discussed several times in the \"Løgting\", and some Union Party politicians argued pragmatically for the retention of Danish: many of the priests were Danes, and if each priest could choose in which language he preaches, this would lead to general confusion, e.g., if a community was accustomed to a church service in Faroese but then got a Danish pastor.\n\nAs with education, the penetration of the native language into the church was only a matter of time and depended on the availability of literature. As early as 1823 the Gospel of Matthew appeared in Faroese, but it met with no broad approval by the people because of the uncertainty of the Faroese orthography that prevailed before Hammershaimb's time. In 1908 the Gospel of John in Faroese was published, but only because the minister Jákup Dahl assisted the revival of Faroese as the church language; he presented a Faroese hymn book in 1921 and completed a translation of the New Testament in 1937. Up to his death in 1944 Dahl continued to work on a translation of the Old Testament, which was completed by Kristian Osvald Viderø in 1961.\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran national church authorized each of Dahl's works immediately after it appeared. Dahl also translated the catechism and a religious history. Dahl's collection of sermons in book form became important for the Faroese. In the remote areas of the islands it was normal for a pastor to be in charge of up to six churches, which he visited in sequence. When the pastor could not be present the services in the churches were conducted by laymen, who used sermons from Dahl’s printed collection.\n\nMarch 13, 1939, is the day on which Faroese became fully authorized as a church language. Today the native clergy use Faroese almost exclusively.\n\nIn 1920 the issue of the use of Faroese in legal proceedings was raised. That resulted from a reform in Denmark, that applies now in court, whereas previously it applied only to written legal documents. On April 11, 1924, a regulation came into force in the Faroes which laid down that the legal language was Danish, but that Faroese-speaking judges may hold their proceedings in Faroese if the parties to the legal action speak Faroese. The legal documents could also be drawn up in Faroese, providing that a certified translation into Danish was also made, if prescribed by law, or required by the defence. These Danish documents were important if proceedings were to take place in Denmark.\n\nIn 1931 further demands were made to expand the use of Faroese in legal proceedings. These were resisted by the \"Samband\" who said that Danish documents were indispensable for further hearings in Danish courts.\n\nOn January 4, 1944 the \"Løgting\" legislated the full equality of Faroese in legal proceedings. That happened because of the special situation of the Faroe Islands in World War II, when Denmark was occupied by Germany and all connections with the government in Copenhagen were severed. However this law remained in force after the war.\n\nThe introduction of Faroese as the business language took place over a longer period of time. Starting in 1920 the Faroese telephone directory appeared in the national language. Starting in 1925 it was the secondary language in the Postverk Føroya or postal service, and starting in 1927 the minutes of the Løgting were recorded in Faroese.\n\nWith the autonomy (home-rule) law of 1948, Faroese was finally the language used in all affairs, with the proviso that Danish should always be taught in school so that all can use Danish to communicate with other Scandinavians.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "586956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=586956", "title": "Galician-Portuguese", "text": "Galician-Portuguese\n\nGalician-Portuguese ( or ', or '), also known as Old Portuguese or as Medieval Galician when referring to the history of each modern language, was a West Iberian Romance language spoken in the Middle Ages, in the northwest area of the Iberian Peninsula. Alternatively, it can be considered a historical period of the Galician and Portuguese languages.\n\nGalician-Portuguese was first spoken in the area bounded in the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean and by the Douro River in the south, comprising Galicia and northern Portugal, but it was later extended south of the Douro by the \"Reconquista\".\n\nIt is the common ancestor of modern Portuguese, Galician, Eonavian and Fala varieties, all of which maintain a very high level of mutual intelligibility. The term \"Galician-Portuguese\" also designates the subdivision of the modern West Iberian group of Romance languages.\n\nGalician-Portuguese developed in the region of the former Roman province of Gallaecia, from the Vulgar Latin (common Latin) that had been introduced by Roman soldiers, colonists and magistrates during the time of the Roman Empire. Although the process may have been slower than in other regions, the centuries of contact with Vulgar Latin, after a period of bilingualism, completely extinguished the native languages, leading to the evolution of a new variety of Latin with a few Gallaecian features.\n\nGallaecian and Lusitanian influences were absorbed into the local Vulgar Latin dialect, which can be detected in some Galician-Portuguese words as well as in placenames of Celtic and Iberian origin. In general, the more cultivated variety of Latin spoken by the Hispano-Roman elites in Roman Hispania had a peculiar regional accent, referred to as \"Hispano ore\" and \"agrestius pronuntians\". The more cultivated variety of Latin coexisted with the popular variety. It is assumed that the Pre-Roman languages spoken by the native people, each used in a different region of Roman Hispania, contributed to the development of several different dialects of Vulgar Latin and that these diverged increasingly over time, eventually evolving into the early Romance Languages of Iberia.\n\nIt is believed that by 600, Vulgar Latin was no longer spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. An early form of Galician-Portuguese was already spoken in the Kingdom of the Suebi and by the year 800 Galician-Portuguese had already become the vernacular of northwestern Iberia. The first known phonetic changes in Vulgar Latin, which began the evolution to Galician-Portuguese, took place during the rule of the Germanic groups, the Suebi (411–585) and Visigoths (585–711). And the Galician-Portuguese \"inflected infinitive\" (or \"personal infinitive\") and the nasal vowels may have evolved under the influence of local Celtic languages (as in Old French). The nasal vowels would thus be a phonologic characteristic of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman Gallaecia, but they are not attested in writing until after the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nThe oldest known document to contain Galician-Portuguese words found in northern Portugal is called the \"Doação à Igreja de Sozello\" and dated to 870 but otherwise composed in Late/Medieval Latin. Another document, from 882, also containing some Galician-Portuguese words is the \"Carta de dotação e fundação da Igreja de S. Miguel de Lardosa\". In fact, many Latin documents written in Portuguese territory contain Romance forms. The \"Notícia de fiadores\", written in 1175, is thought by some to be the oldest known document written in Galician-Portuguese.\nThe \"Pacto dos irmãos Pais\", recently discovered (and possibly dating from before 1173), has been said to be even older, but despite the enthusiasm of some scholars, it has been shown that the documents are not really written in Galician-Portuguese but are in fact a mixture of Late Latin and Galician-Portuguese phonology, morphology and syntax. The \"Noticia de Torto\", of uncertain date (c. 1214?), and the \"Testamento de D. Afonso II\" (27 June 1214) are most certainly Galician-Portuguese. The earliest poetic texts (but not the manuscripts in which they are found) date from c. 1195 to c. 1225. Thus, by the end of the 12th century and the beginning of the 13th there are documents in prose and verse written in the local Romance vernacular.\n\nIn Galicia the oldest document showing traces of the underlying Romance language is a royal charter by king Silo, dated in 775: it uses substrate words as \"arrogio\" and \"lagena\", now \"arroio\" (\"stream\") and \"laxe\" (\"stone\"), and presents also the elision of unstressed vowels and the lenition of plosive consonants; actually, many Galician Latin charters written during the Middle Ages show interferences of the local Galician-Portuguese contemporary language. As for the oldest document written in Galician-Portuguese in Galicia, it is probably a document from the monastery of Melón dated in 1231, since the 1228-dated \"Charter of the Boo Burgo of Castro Caldelas\" is probably a slightly latter translation of a Latin original.\n\nGalician-Portuguese had a special cultural role in the literature of the Christian kingdoms of Crown of Castile (Kingdoms of Castile, Leon and Galicia,part of the medieval NW Iberian Peninsula) comparable to the Catalan Language of the Crown of Aragon (Principality of Catalonia and Kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia and Majorca, NE medieval Iberian Peninsula), or that of Occitan in France and Italy during the same historical period. The main extant sources of Galician-Portuguese lyric poetry are these:\n\nThe language was used for literary purposes from the final years of the 12th century to roughly the middle of the 14th century in what are now Spain and Portugal and was, almost without exception, the only language used for the composition of lyric poetry. Over 160 poets are recorded, among them Bernal de Bonaval, Pero da Ponte, Johan Garcia de Guilhade, Johan Airas de Santiago, and Pedr' Amigo de Sevilha. The main secular poetic genres were the \"cantigas d'amor\" (male-voiced love lyric), the \"cantigas d'amigo\" (female-voiced love lyric) and the \"cantigas d'escarnho e de mal dizer\" (including a variety of genres from personal invective to social satire, poetic parody and literary debate).\n\nAll told, nearly 1,700 poems survive in these three genres, and there is a corpus of over 400 \"cantigas de Santa Maria\" (narrative poems about miracles and hymns in honor of the Holy Virgin). The Castilian king Alfonso X composed his \"cantigas de Santa Maria\" and his \"cantigas de escárnio e maldizer\" in Galician-Portuguese, even though he used Castilian for prose.\n\nKing Dinis of Portugal, who also contributed (with 137 extant texts, more than any other author) to the secular poetic genres, made the language official in Portugal in 1290. Until then, Latin had been the official (written) language for royal documents; the spoken language did not have a name and was simply known as \"lingua vulgar\" (\"ordinary language\", that is Vulgar Latin) until it was named \"Portuguese\" in King Dinis' reign. \"Galician-Portuguese\" and \"português arcaico\" (\"Old Portuguese\") are modern terms for the common ancestor of modern Portuguese and modern Galician. Compared to the differences in Ancient Greek dialects, the alleged differences between 13th-century Portuguese and Galician are trivial.\n\nAs a result of political division, Galician-Portuguese lost its unity when the County of Portugal separated from the Kingdom of Galicia in 1128 (a dependent kingdom of Leon) to establish the Kingdom of Portugal. The Galician and Portuguese versions of the language then diverged over time as they followed independent evolutionary paths.\nAs Portugal's territory was extended southward during the Reconquista, the increasingly distinctive Portuguese language was adopted by the people in those regions, supplanting the earlier Arabic and other Romance/Latin languages that were spoken in these conquered areas during the Moorish era. Meanwhile, Galician was influenced by the neighboring Leonese language, especially during the time of kingdoms of Leon and Leon-Castile, and in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it has been influenced by Castilian. Two cities at the time of separation, Braga and Porto, were within the County of Portugal and have remained within Portugal. Further north, the cities of Lugo, A Coruña and the great medieval centre of Santiago de Compostela remained within Galicia.\n\nGalician was the main written language in Galicia till the 16th century, but later it was displaced by Castilian Spanish, which was the official language of the Crown of Castille. Galician slowly became mainly an oral language, preserved by the majority rural or \"uneducated\" population living in the villages and towns, and Castilian was taught as the \"correct\" language to the bilingual educated elite in the cities. During most of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries its written used was largely reduced to popular literature and theatre and private letters. From the 18th century on grew the interest for the language, due to the studies of illustrated writers such as Martin Sarmiento —who studied the evolution of Galician from Latin and prepared the foundations for the first dictionary of Galician—, José Cornide, and father Sobreira. In the 19th century a true literature in Galician emerged during the Rexurdimento, followed by the apparition of journals and, in the 20th century, scientific publications. Because until comparatively recently most Galicians lived in many small towns and villages in a relatively remote and mountainous land, the language changed very slowly and was only very slightly influenced from outside the region. That situation made Galician remain the vernacular of Galicia until the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries and its most spoken language till the early 21st century. Modern Galician was only officially recognized by the Second Spanish Republic in the 1930s as a co-official language with Castilian within Galicia. The recognition was revoked by the regime of Francisco Franco but was restored after his death.\n\nThe linguistic classification of Galician and Portuguese is still discussed today. There are those among Galician independence groups who demand their reunification as well as Portuguese and Galician philologists who argue that both are dialects of a common language rather than two separate ones.\n\nThe Fala language, spoken in a small region of the Spanish autonomous community of Extremadura, underwent a similar development as Galician.\n\nToday Galician is the regional language of Galicia (sharing co-officiality with Spanish), and it is spoken by the majority of its population, although there is a hard decline of use and efficient knowledge among the younger generations, and the phonetics and lexicon of many occasional users is heavily influenced by Spanish. Portuguese continues to grow and, today, is the sixth most spoken language in the world.\n\n and were apico-alveolar, and and were lamino-alveolar. Later, all the affricate sibilants became fricatives, with the apico-alveolar and lamino-alveolar sibilants remaining distinct for a time but eventually merging in most dialects. See History of Portuguese for more information.\n\nThere has been a sharing of folklore in the Galician-Portuguese region going back to prehistoric times. As the Galician-Portuguese language spread south with the Reconquista, supplanting Mozarabic, this ancient sharing of folklore intensified. In 2005 the governments of Portugal and Spain jointly proposed that Galician-Portuguese oral traditions be made part of the Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The work of documenting and transmitting that common culture involves several universities and other organizations.\n\nGalician-Portuguese folklore is rich in oral traditions. These include the \"cantigas ao desafio\" or \"regueifas\", duels of improvised songs, many legends, stories, poems, romances, folk songs, sayings and riddles, and ways of speech that still retain a lexical, phonetic, morphological and syntactic similarity.\n\nAlso part of the common heritage of oral traditions are the markets and festivals of patron saints and processions, religious celebrations such as the \"magosto,\" \"entroido\" or Corpus Christi, with ancient dances and tradition – like the one where Coca the dragon fights with Saint George; and also traditional clothing and adornments, crafts and skills, work-tools, carved vegetable lanterns, superstitions, traditional knowledge about plants and animals. All these are part of a common heritage considered in danger of extinction as the traditional way of living is replaced by modern life, and the jargon of fisherman, the names of tools in traditional crafts, and the oral traditions which form part of celebrations are slowly forgotten.\n\nA Galician-Portuguese \"baixo-limiao\" lect is spoken in several villages. In Galicia it is spoken in Entrimo and Lobios and in northern Portugal in Terras de Bouro (lands of the Buri) and Castro Laboreiro including the mountain town (county seat) of Soajo and surrounding villages.\n\nAbout the Galician-Portuguese languages\n\nAbout Galician-Portuguese culture\n\nManuscripts containing Galician-Portuguese ('secular') lyric (cited from Cohen 2003 [see below under \"critical editions\"]):\n\nManuscripts containing the \"Cantigas de Santa Maria\":\n\nCritical editions of individual genres of Galician-Portuguese poetry (note that the \"cantigas d'amor\" are split between Michaëlis 1904 and Nunes 1932):\n\nOn the biography and chronology of the poets and the courts they frequented, the relation of these matters to the internal structure of the manuscript tradition, and myriad relevant questions in the field, please see:\n\nFor Galician-Portuguese prose, the reader might begin with:\n\nThere is no up-to-date historical grammar of medieval Galician-Portuguese.

Defined in these global terms, the meaning of a sign is not in general analyzable with full exactness into completely localized terms, but aspects of its meaning can be given approximate analyses, and special cases of sign relations frequently admit of more local analyses.\n\nTwo aspects of meaning that may be given approximate analyses are the \"connotative relation\" and the \"denotative relation\". The connotative relation is the relation between signs and their interpretant signs. The denotative relation is the relation between signs and objects. An arbitrary association exists between the \"signified\" and the \"signifier.\"\nFor example, a US salesperson doing business in Japan might interpret silence following an offer as rejection, while to Japanese negotiators silence means the offer is being considered. This difference in interpretations represents a difference in: semiotics\n\nThe triadic (three part) model of the sign separates the meaning of a sign into three distinct components:\n\n1.The representamen, which is the medium, or ‘sign vehicle’, through which the sign is represented. For example, this could be written/spoken words, a photograph, or a painting.\n\n2.The interpretant, or what is meant by the sign \n\n3. The object, or that to which the sign refers \n\nTogether, these three components generate semiosis. For example, an exclamation mark can be broken down into these components. The representamen is the exclamation mark itself, the interpretant is the idea of excitement or an elevated volume of speech, and the object is the actual excitement or elevated volume of speech to which it refers.\nWhile it might appear that the latter two are the same, the subtle difference lies in the fact that the interpretant refers to the idea of something, and the object is the thing itself.\n\nThe representamen component of the sign can be further broken down into three categories, which are icon, index, and symbol. These denote the degree of abstraction from the object to which they refer. A symbol, which is the most abstract, does not resemble or bear any physical relation to the thing that it represents in any way. For example, a peace sign has no relation to peace aside from its social construction as a symbol that represents it. An icon is slightly less abstract, and resembles to some degree the thing that it represents, and bears some physical likeness to it. A good example of this would be a painted portrait. An index is the least arbitrary category of representamen, and has a definite physical tie to that which it represents. This could be something like a weather vane blowing in the wind indicating that it is windy out, or smoke, which indicates a fire.\n\nThe triadic model of the sign was proposed by Charles Peirce. In contradistinction to Ferdinand de Saussure's dyadic model, which assumed no material referent, Peirce's model assumes that in order for a sign to be meaningful, it must refer to something external and cannot be self-contained, as it is for Saussure. Thus, Peirce's model includes the addition of an 'object'. The ‘representamen’ and ‘interpretant’ components of the triadic model are comparable to Saussure’s dyadic model of the sign, which breaks down into signifier and signified.\n\n\n"}

Deconstructive interpretation holds that the entire history of Western philosophy with its language and traditions has emphasized the desire for immediate access to meaning, and thus built a metaphysics or ontotheology based on privileging presence over absence.\n\nIn \"Being and Time\" (1927; transl. 1962), Martin Heidegger argues that the concept of time prevalent in all Western thought has largely remained unchanged since the definition offered by Aristotle in the \"Physics\". Heidegger says, \"Aristotle's essay on time is the first detailed Interpretation of this phenomenon [time] which has come down to us. Every subsequent account of time, including Henri Bergson's, has been essentially determined by it.\" Aristotle defined time as \"the number of movement in respect of before and after\". By defining time in this way Aristotle privileges what is present-at-hand, namely the \"presence\" of time. Heidegger argues in response that \"entities are grasped in their Being as 'presence'; this means that they are understood with regard to a definite mode of time – the 'Present'\". Central to Heidegger's own philosophical project is the attempt to gain a more authentic understanding of time. Heidegger considers time to be the unity of three ecstases: the past, the present, and the future. \n\nDeconstructive thinkers, like Jacques Derrida, describe their task as the questioning or \"deconstruction\" of this metaphysical tendency in Western philosophy. Derrida writes, \"Without a doubt, Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of ousia as parousia, on the basis of the now, the point, etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle's text both this limitation and its opposite.\" This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who in \"Being and Time\" claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as the ready-to-hand and being-with.\n\nThe presence to which Heidegger refers is both a presence as in a \"now\" and also a presence as in an eternal present, as one might associate with God or the \"eternal\" laws of science. This hypostatized (underlying) belief in presence is undermined by novel phenomenological ideas, such that presence itself does not subsist, but comes about primordially through the action of our futural projection, our realization of finitude and the reception or rejection of the traditions of our time.\n"}

He was a leading figure in modern Indian drama. Mohit Chottopadhya died on 12 April 2012. He had been suffering from cancer.\n\nMohit Chattopadhyaya was born in the town of Barisal, now in Bangladesh. He left Bangladesh and immigrated to Calcutta (Kolkata) with his family at the age of thirteen. An avid reader, he started writing as a young boy. In Kolkata, he was a frequent visitor of Chaitanya Library, near his home at Bidon Street. In the library he stumbled upon \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" by Luigi Pirandello, his first contact with an absurd play. He finished his Matriculation examination in 1950 and joined City College, Kolkata. While studying in City College he became close to culturally like-minded people, who became prominent poets, authors, artists in their later lives. He became close friend with Sunil Gongopadhyay, Shibshmbhu Pal, Soumitra Chatterjee, Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhay. He earned his Masters in Bengali literature as a private candidate from University of Calcutta. His career in academia began as a lecturer at Jangipur College, Murshidabad and later as a Reader of Bengali Literature at City College.\n\nMohit Chattopadhyaya started his literary career as a poet and later shifted to writing plays. He started writing prose poetry along with his friends, and had little interest in rhyming. At first his poetry was published in various magazines and shortly it was published in book format as his anthology of poems.\n\nSubsequently, he stopped writing poems and devoted entirely to writing plays. From the very beginning he avoided writing realistic plays and wrote esoteric often highly political plays. Though he refused to be labelled as an Absurdist playwright, claiming his plays do not conform to the Philosophy of \"The Theatre of the Absurd\" but frequently he is referred as an exponent of Indian Absurd Drama. The cryptic nature of his plays encouraged critics to call his plays \"Kimitibadi\" (Kim+Iti) in Bengali, which in English meant, \"What is it?”\n\nAs a prolific playwright he has written over one hundred plays. Some of his plays have been translated in different languages and have been regularly performed by various theatre groups around India. Other than full-length plays, Mohit Chattopadhyaya has written One Act plays, Verse plays Curtain Raisers, Microplays; he has adapted, edited and translated a number of plays in Bengali from other languages.\n\nHis play \"Raajrakto\" (Guinea pig) is considered as a milestone in the history of Bengali political drama. Kolkata based theatre group Theatre Workshop under the direction of Bibhash Chokrobarty first performed the play in Kolkata. Later the play was translated into various languages. In Delhi Rajindernath directed the Hindi version. Famous actor Kulbhushan Kharbanda acted in the play. In Mumbai, Satyadeb Dubey directed the play and Amrish Puri acted in it. Amol Palekar acted in the Marathi version and Shymanand Jalan produced another Hindi version of the play. For political reasons the production was banned by The Indian Government.\n\nIn 1973 Mohit Chattopadhyaya started working on the film script of \"Chorus\" in close collaboration with Mrinal Sen. He also wrote the lyrics of the songs used in the film. In the following years he wrote the screenplays of four films by Mrinal Sen, \"Mrigaya\" (1976)\n\"Poroshuraam\" (1980), \"Oka Uri Katha\" (1977), \"Genesis\" (1986); all the films received numerous awards in national and International film festivals. In 1997 he wrote the screenplay and the lyrics of the film, \"Damu\", which received National Award for best children's film and various other awards.\n\nIn 1980 Mohit Chattopadhyaya finished his first and only directorial endeavour, \"Megher Khela\" (The Play of The Clouds), a children's film. He wrote the story and the screenplay. Raja Sen, who would become an accomplished film director later, was the assistant director; Ranajit Ray was the Cinematographer; Debashish Dasgupta was the Music Director and Mrinmoy Chakrobarty was in charge of editing. The film received critical acclaim. It was shown in various national and international film festivals and got honorary mention at Bucharest Children's Film Festival. Austrian National Television bought the film rights and telecast it in its National Channel.\n\nMohit Chattopadhyaya started writing scripts for TV serial (TV Series) in the following years. Raja Sen directed almost all his early TV scripts. \"Subarnolata\", \"Arogyonikatan\", \"Adorsho Hindu Hotel\" marked one of the most popular and critically acclaimed television serials on Kolkata Doordarshan. He continued writing scripts and worked with other directors in later period.\n\nMohit Chattopadhyay has also written numerous essays, articles and papers on theatre, film production, and scriptwriting. One of his most controversial series of essays has been on the relationship between literature and drama. He has taken part in various seminars, talks, workshops and panel discussions on literature and performing arts. He is also the Executive Member of Paschimbanga Natya Academy.\n\nThe recipient of scores of awards and felicitations, Mohit Chattopadhyay received the Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1991. Among other awards he is the recipient of Girish Award, West Bengal State Award, BFJA Award, Nandikaar Award. He is also conferred with Sangeet Natak Akademi Tagore Ratna, special awards to commemorate 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was spoken approximately until the mid-18th century, when it was superseded by Low German, in the areas of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, central Brandenburg (Mittelmark) and eastern Saxony-Anhalt (Wittenberg), as well as in eastern parts of Lower Saxony (Wendland) and Schleswig-Holstein (Ostholstein and Lauenburg). In the south it bordered on the Sorbian language area in Lusatia.\n\nBy the 18th century Lechitic Polabian was in some respects markedly different from other Slavic languages, most notably in having a strong German influence. It was close to Pomeranian and Kashubian, and attested only in a handful of manuscripts, dictionaries and various writings from the 17th and 18th centuries. As can be seen in the comparisons of the Lord's Prayer below, Polabian contained many German loanwords, such as \"Wader\" (Father) and \"Rîk\" (Kingdom).\n\nAbout 2800 Polabian words are known; of prose writings, only a few prayers, one wedding song and a few folktales survive. Immediately before the language became extinct, several people started to collect phrases and compile wordlists and were engaged with folklore of the Polabian Slavs, but only one of them appears to have been a native speaker of Polabian (himself leaving only 13 pages of linguistically relevant material from a 310-page manuscript). The last native speaker of Polabian, a woman, died in 1756, and the last person who spoke limited Polabian died in 1825.\n\nThe most important monument of the language is the so-called \"Vocabularium Venedicum\" (1679–1719) by Christian Hennig.\n\nThe language left many traces to this day in toponymy; for example, Wustrow \"Place on the island\", Lüchow (Polabian: \"Ljauchüw\"), Sagard, Gartow etc. It is also a likely origin of the name Berlin, from the Polabian stem \"berl-\"/\"birl-\" (\"swamp\").\n\nFor Polabian the following segments are reconstructable:\n\nThe Lord's Prayer in Polabian and related Lechitic languages, compared to German and English: Germanic loanwords, which are comparatively rare in the other West Slavic languages, are highlighted in bold. (Even English, which has extensive Latin influence, has only three Latinate loanwords in its version: \"trespass[es]\", \"temptation\", and \"deliver\".)\n\n\n"}

The word is a portmanteau word, coming from the prefix \"pre\" and the word \"retirement\". The state is being found primarily in first world economies, with aging populations. A \"Pre-tireree\" will continue to create economic wealth and/or contribute to the generation of knowledge by research, likely on a part-time or reduced hours basis. Some \"Pre-tirerees\" use the period to give back by providing unpaid social support. This form of unpaid work creates economic benefit, by allowing taxes to be focused on other wealth creating or protecting activities, but relies on the existence of sufficient financial resource.\n\nThe emergence of a new blend of work and retirement was established in Consumer Intelligence research in December 2014. \nHere are key findings from the research published in a report by Zopa (2014):\n\n\nThe concept appears to be similar to semi-retirement, but the term indicates a half retirement form, without indicating the gradual shift towards a fully retired end state or the non-existence of retirement.\n\nOne position that may be extrapolated from the research is that a growing number of individuals hope to be healthy enough to get Pre-tirement until they die.\n\nWhile the research shows that a number of individuals chose to shift to this state, it also shows the existence of Enforced Pre-tirement, individuals a pension that will support their living costs. Further research will be needed to establish the different types of Pre-tirement states, and their root causes.\n\nThe use of the term retirement to encompass Pre-tirement would hide this emerging state.\n\nEffects of different forms of work retirement balance have not yet been fully researched.\nEarly findings show that an abrupt shift from Full Time Work to Full Time Retirement can cause depression and other negative health effects.\n\nConsideration of the positive benefits of Pre-tirement are likely to be accelerated as the impact of the aging population starts to take deeper effect.\n\nFirst found in a Blog by The Martian Observer (2010) The Blog's use of the neologism matches the term described in the Zopa Report.\n\nFirst used in a book title by Kris Miller (2012), though her usage describes planning for retirement, rather than an emerging state of employment.\n\nThe ACAS website referred the important shift in retirement norms observed in the Zopa Report: \"many people are choosing to ease into retirement in a 'phased or gradual process'.\n\nUse of the neologism in news publications peaked after the publication of the Zopa Report.\n\nUsage has been heard on the Radio 4 Today Program \nMarch 2015 Esther Rantzen used the term when discussing The Silver Line.\n"}

The funds accumulated may then be used to make a larger purchase such as taking out a savings bond or to pay a large upcoming bill. Often issued in conjunction with post office run savings banks, savings stamps have also been issued by private companies. Supermarkets have issued the stamps to enable the spreading of large bills, package holiday companies have used them to enable customers to save for an annual holiday, and utilities companies have used the stamps to enable customers to spread the cost of their bills.\n\nSavings stamps are not to be confused with trading stamps which provide a discount on goods purchased as part of a customer loyalty program.\n\nIn philately, savings stamps are regarded as a form of Cinderella stamp.\n\nFrom 1880 ordinary penny postage stamps were used to save up one shilling (12 pence) which was then sufficient to open a Post Office Savings Bank account, although the minimum amount required changed to £1 in 1912. This scheme continued until after the Second World War but has now ended. In addition the Bank used specially designed savings stamps with higher values which also could be used to save enough to open an account.\n\nPrivate companies in Britain also used savings stamps including the holiday company Butlins and supermarkets such as Sainsburys and Safeway.\n\nA wide variety of utility companies made use of the stamps, particularly regional electronic companies, but also British Telecom for telephone bills and government bodies for payment of National Insurance contributions or television licences.\n\nMost uses of savings stamps have now ceased in the UK, replaced by electronic cards.\n\nIn the United States \"Postal Savings Stamps\" were introduced in 1911 and War Savings Stamps were issued during both World Wars. Savings stamps are worth their face amounts; the denominations are $0.10, $0.25, $0.50, $1, and $5. The sale of savings stamps was discontinued June 30, 1970.\n\nBelgium and France used special savings stamps in the 1880s and many other countries around the world have used them for diverse purposes, including Canada, India, Russia, Bulgaria and Singapore.\n\nWar savings stamps were issued by several British Commonwealth countries, including Gold Coast and India.\n\n\n"}

Bell and others have argued that the use of \"sexy baby voice\" is problematic because it demeans the speaker, who appears as a \"submissive 12-year-old trying to be a sex object\", or because its use in film and television, as a tool of sexual manipulation, exploits contemporary culture's \"fetish for adult sexuality wrapped in adolescent packages\".\n\nOther commentators questioned the purpose of critiquing the use of the speech pattern, asserting that \"picking at the vocal quirks of your own gender is just as much of a nuisance as harping on the bodies that belong to them\".

It is one of the earliest known documents in Swahili. \n\nKnown by various titles in English, including \"The Book of the Battle of Tambuka\" and \"The Story of Heraclius\", the story recounts numerous events of the Byzantine-Arab Wars and Byzantine-Ottoman Wars between the Muslims and Romans (the contemporary name for the Byzantines). The Byzantines were represented by the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, Heraclius. The story covers a period from 628 (the Battle of Mu'tah) to 1453 (the Fall of Constantinople). \"Tambuka\" is the Swahili rendering of Tabuk, a city located in north-western Saudi Arabia.\nThe oldest manuscript of the epic is dated 1141 on the Islamic Calendar, corresponding to AD 1728. It was written at Yunga, a royal palace in the old city of Pate (the palace has since been destroyed). In strophe 1124–1125, the author notes that the \"king of Yung\"' (that is, the then Sultan of Pate) asked him to write an epic on the heroic deeds of the first followers of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The author identifies himself in one of the final stanzas (1146) as Mwengo, son of Athumani or Osman. Not much more is known about him other than that he wrote at the court of the Sultan of Pate, that he was no longer a young man by 1728, and that some other poems are ascribed to him. He also had a son, Abu Bakr bin Mwengo, who wrote an imitation of his father's epic somewhere in the middle of the 18th century.\n\nLike other manuscripts of the period in Swahili, the \"Utendi wa Tambuka\" is written in Arabic script. The language used is a northern dialect of Swahili called Kiamu; some manuscripts, however, show influence from Kigunya (another northern dialect), while others show traces of Kiunguja, the dialect of Zanzibar.\n\nThe \"Utendi wa Tambuka\" is a prime example of the Swahili poetic form of \"utenzi\". Utenzi verse form consists of four-line stanzas, with each line having eight syllables. The last syllables of the first three lines rhyme with each other, while the fourth line has a rhyme that is constant throughout the whole of the epic. This last rhyme thus serves to tie all stanzas of the epic together. Most Swahili words have penultimate stress, resulting in every line having at least penultimate stress. Within a line of eight syllables there are no further meter requirements. The verse form can be illustrated by the first stanza of the poem:)\n\nThe first three lines all end in \"-bu\". The last syllable of the fourth line ends in the vowel \"a\", and this sound is found at the end of every stanza of the poem. When recited, this last syllable is sustained for some time and given emphasis.\n\nThe plot depicts a religious war between the Byzantines and the Muslims. The Prophet sends a letter to East Roman/Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, in which he tells him that the Byzantine belief that Jesus is the son of God is incorrect. Heraclius declares his intent to persevere in his adherence to Christianity on the grounds that the Byzantines have inherited their belief from their ancestors. The Muslims attack and, after epic struggles, eventually defeat the Byzantines. Heraclius' minister and his associates are captured and once again given the choice to accept Islam or die; they refuse to be converted and are executed.\n\nThe central figure of the poem, and the most heroic one, is Ali ibn Abi Talib, a full nephew on the father's side of the Prophet. He is nicknamed \"Haidar\", the lion, and in the course of the poem many other praise names are applied to him. Ali was married to the noble daughter of the prophet Muhammad, Fatimah.\n\nThe second hero in order of magnitude is Umar ibn al-Khattab.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2010655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2010655", "title": "Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing", "text": "Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing\n\n\"Winning isn’t everything; it's the only thing\" is a well-known quotation in sports. It is attributed to UCLA Bruins football coach Henry Russell (\"Red\") Sanders, who spoke two different versions of the quotation. In 1950, at a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo physical education workshop, Sanders told his group: \"Men, I'll be honest. Winning isn't everything\", then following a long pause, \"Men, it's the only thing!\" In a three-part article, December 7, 1953, on Red Sanders, by Bud Furillo of the \"Los Angeles Herald and Express\", the phrase is quoted in the sub head. Furillo said in his unpublished memoirs Sanders first made the statement to him after UCLA's loss to USC in 1949. The phrase is quoted in the 1953 film \"Trouble Along the Way\" by Sherry Jackson's character, Carol Williams. In 1955, in a \"Sports Illustrated\" article preceding the 1956 Rose Bowl, he was quoted as saying \"Sure, winning isn't every thing; it's the only thing.\"\n\nThe quotation is widely, but wrongly attributed to American football coach Vince Lombardi, who probably heard the phrase from UCLA coach Sanders. Lombardi is on record using the quotation as early as 1959 in his opening talk on the first day of the Packers’ training camp. The quotation captured the American public's attention during Lombardi's highly successful reign as coach of the Packers in the 1960s. Over time, the quotation took on a life of its own. The words graced the walls of locker rooms, ignited pre-game pep talks, and echoed from the rafters of banquet halls. According to the late James Michener's \"Sports in America\", Lombardi claimed to have been misquoted. What he intended to say was \"Winning isn't everything. The will to win is the only thing.\" However, Lombardi is on record repeating the original version of the quotation on several occasions.\n\nIts assertion about the importance of winning has been touted as a basic tenet of the American sports creed and, at the same time, identified as encapsulating what is purportedly wrong with competitive sports. \nThis credo has served as counterpoint to the well known sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice that, \"it's not that you won or lost but how you played the game\", and to the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin: \"The most important thing. . . is not winning but taking part\".\n\nWhile at UCLA, another famous quote was attributed to Sanders regarding the UCLA–USC rivalry, \"Beating 'SC is not a matter of life or death, it's more important than that.\"\n\n"}

David Cusin was killed on this raid.\"\n\nDavid Cuisin or Cusin possessed a castle and land near Ballaghaderreen. Another bearer of the name was Tomás Cúisín, listed under 1462 in the Annals of Ulster as \"the best master of law in his time in Armagh who had a great school in this year.\" It is unknown if either of the latter two were related to Ádhamh.\n\nÁdhamh Cúisín has been noted by Ó Muraíle as \"the most prolific of the scribes in the portion of the manuscript that still survives - his hand appears on 99 of the extant folios). The manuscript was known to contain 368 folios in the 15th and 16th centuries. Two hundred and fifty years later, Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh transcribed a seventy-page historical-genealogical compilation called Seanchas Síl Ír. His source can be shown to be The Book of Uí Mhaine. Mac Fhirbhisigh's very faithful transcript is especially valuable as four of the original fourteen folios have since been lost.\n\nThe book began to be written some time before 1392-1394, and some time after that date. It was written at the behest of Muircheartach Ó Cellaigh, who was Bishop of Clonfert (1378–1393) and Archbishop of Tuam till his death in 1407. Bishop Ó Cellaigh was a grandnephew of Uilliam Buidhe Ó Cellaigh, king of Uí Maine from about 1349 to 1381.\n\nThe only other scribe of the book known by name is Faolán Mac an Ghabhann na Scéal, who died in 1423. A poet, Mac an Ghabhann's poem \"Adham ar n-athair uile\" is penned by Cúisín.\n\n"}
