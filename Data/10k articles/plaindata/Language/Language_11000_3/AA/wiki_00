Her poetry expresses a fervent evangelical Christian faith and reflects thorough scriptural knowledge.\n\nAnn was born in April 1776 near the village of Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa, from the market town of Llanfyllin (in the former county of Montgomeryshire) in Powys. She was the daughter of John Evan Thomas, a tenant farmer and churchwarden, and his wife, Jane. She had two older sisters, an older brother, John, and a younger brother, Edward. Her parents' house, Dolwar Fechan, was an isolated farm-house some south of Llanfihangel and north of Dolanog, set among hills and streams.\n\nNot far away lay Pennant Melangell, where Saint Melangell had lived as a hermit in the 6th century.\n\nAnn was brought up in the Anglican church; but in 1794, when she was 18, her mother died, and about this time or perhaps earlier she followed her brothers John and Edward in becoming drawn to the Methodist movement. In 1796 she joined the Calvinistic Methodist movement after hearing the preaching of Benjamin Jones of Pwllheli.\n\nAfter the deaths of both her parents she married Thomas Griffiths, a farmer from the parish of Meifod and an elder of the Calvinistic Methodist church.\n\nIn August 1805 she died following childbirth aged 29 and was buried on 12 August 1805 at Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa.\n\nShe left behind a handful of stanzas in the Welsh language. These were preserved and published by her mentor, the Calvinistic Methodist minister, John Hughes of Pontrobert, and his wife, Ruth, who had been a maid at Ann Griffiths' farm and was a close confidante.\n\nTogether with Mary Jones (1784–1864), a poor Welsh girl who walked to Bala to buy a Bible, Ann Griffiths became a national icon by the end of the 19th century, and was a significant figure in Welsh nonconformism.\n\nAnn's poems are an expression of her fervent evangelical Christian faith, and reflect her incisive intellect and thorough scriptural knowledge. She is the most prominent female hymn-writer in Welsh. Her work is regarded as a highlight of Welsh literature, and her longest poem \"\" (Wondrous, wondrous to angels...) was described by the dramatist and literary critic Saunders Lewis as \"one of the majestic songs in the religious poetry of Europe\".\n\nHer hymn \"Wele'n sefyll rhwng y myrtwydd\" is commonly sung in Wales to the tune Cwm Rhondda.\n\nThe service of enthronement of Rowan Williams as Archbishop of Canterbury in February 2003 included Rowan's own translation of one of her hymns: \"Yr Arglwydd Iesu\" (\"The Lord Jesus\").\n\nThe television channel S4C commissioned \"Ann!\", a musical based on the life of Ann Griffiths, to be performed at the 2003 National Eisteddfod at Meifod. The performance was subsequently televised and a CD was released.\n\n\nThe standard edition of her hymns and letters is E. Wyn James (ed.), \"Rhyfeddaf fyth . . .\" (Gwasg Gregynog, 1998).\n\n"}

{"id": "2365188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2365188", "title": "Cocooning", "text": "Cocooning\n\nCocooning is staying inside one's home, insulated from perceived danger, instead of going out. The term was coined in 1981 by Faith Popcorn, a trend forecaster and marketing consultant. It is used in social science, marketing, parenting, economic forecasting, self-help, religion, and has become part of standard English as defined by multiple dictionaries.\n\nEvidence of intensifying home-focused behavior became more pronounced in Popcorn's data from 1984 and by 1985 she forecast it would be a trend, not a fad. She explained the concept involves building a \"shell of safety\" around oneself in a 1986 article in The New Yorker.\n\nIn 1987, \"The Washington Post\" columnist George Will explained that \"the harassments of daily life -- looming nuclear incineration, rude waiters -- have driven people to <nowiki>\"</nowiki>cocooning<nowiki>\"</nowiki>. They have gone to ground in their dens with their VCRs and compact-disc players, snug in their Barcaloungers equipped with stereo headphones, the better to keep at bay the modern world, the discontinuities of which have produced a longing for tradition.\"\n\nA \"Los Angeles Times\" article in 1987 called \"The Essence of Cocooning: It's a Desire for a Cozy, Perfect Environment Far From the Influences of a Madding World\" tied the concept to fear of environment destruction. In the article, Popcorn cited the increased use of gourmet frozen foods, soft furniture such as Barcaloungers, investment services, and \"mom foods\" that remind consumers of adolescence, as examples of cocooning behavior. She cited less involvement in social and political issues as a downside of cocooning, though she predicted a counter-trend to emerge.\n\nThe term was designated in 1987 by the editors of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language as a word being tracked for possible inclusion in the dictionary. The dictionary's editors later included it, as did Merriam Webster's Dictionary.\n\nA 1989 \"New York Times\" article called \"Lounge Wear for Cocooning\" described a trend among many upscale designers, including Ralph Lauren, Bob Mackie, Giorgio Armani and Valentino, to create clothing for use at home that was more dressy than sleepwear but less formal than sportswear. \"However, sleeping is not the point. Neither, necessarily, is seduction. Cocooning, a dream word for market researchers, is. Everybody is working. Everybody is tired. Everybody just wants to go home and watch 48-inch TV. Relax, slip into something comfortable, and join the ranks of homebody chic,\" the article says.\n\nIn its 1996 \"Year in Review\" article, \"Time\" cited cocooning as a major social trend and linked it to \"Bowling Alone\", a 1995 essay by Harvard Professor Robert Putnam, describing a decrease in in-person social intercourse.\n\nShortly after the September 11 attacks, the \"Chicago Tribune\" ran an article entitled \"The 'cocooning' trend draws reinforcement\" which asserted that the terrorist attacks intensified cocooning.\n\nIn 2002, La-Z-Boy, in partnership with Popcorn debuted \"cocooning chairs\" for women, scaled-down reclining chairs allowing women to get up and down easily but still big enough to pull children onto their laps. An even smaller version was sold for children.\n\nA study by sociologists at the University of Toronto in 2004 concluded that Canadians were socializing less with their friends and family and spending more time \"cocooning\" home alone. The change was attributed to \"higher rates of separation and divorce, smaller households with fewer children, delayed marriages and more individuals living alone.\"\nIn 2013, a \"USA Today\" article entitled \"Cocooning: It's back and thanks to tech, it's bigger\" concluded that cocooning had turned into \"super-cocooning\": \"Thanks to always-on wireless Internet connectivity and bigger, better TVs that reproduce pixel-perfect high-definition video, cocooning is entering a new evolutionary stage. Consumers are staying home more, watching movies delivered via cable, satellite, Internet or disc, eating in and transforming their apartments and houses into a shelter from the daily social storm.\"\n\nIn \"Fortune\" in 2015, Popcorn said \"uber-cocooning, and now even bunkering\" were becoming prominent because people had become \"terrified\" of world conditions.\n\nA 2014 clinical book for mental health practitioners, lawyers and educators describes the parental strategy of cocooning (or \"restrictive mediation\") as explicitly limiting objectionable material, including from television and the movies, from younger children. When the same practice is used with older adolescents, it was determined parents were less connected to their children, more likely to be resented and less successful in maintaining control in the long term.\n\nIn \"The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia\", its authors contend that adoptive parents have \"popularized\" cocooning as \"a strategic way in which to create a safe and secure home in which to raise a newly adopted child.\" The psychologist Patti Zordich trademarked \"cocooning\" as the focus of the resources she provides to adoptive families.\n\nStandard cocooning tactics for adoptive parents include retreating from the outside world to focus on the immediate family in order to build bonds that will secure attachment with the child.\n\nA 1994 article in \"PC Magazine\" described \"virtual cocooning\" in terms of virtual reality products for exploring and designing one's own interiors or world.\n\nIn South Korea, experts who saw the rise of \"digital cocooning\" in 2006 said that while some people were experiencing a nomadic outdoor life thanks to wireless devices, others were choosing to stay \"nested up at home\" with them. People who almost never left home because of the internet were characterized as \"digital zombies.\"\n\nDigital cocooning was the subject of a 2014 panel discussion about \"isolating elements of pervasive mobile technology.\"\n\nA 2014 report by Euromonitor International, a strategic market research firm, contends that \"A major consequence of the growth in mobile web use is that the trend towards cocooning – the home-centred lifestyle that characterised the early part of the century – has given way to a movement towards mobile or individual cocooning, whereby consumers are immersed in their own digital worlds anywhere and anytime.\"\n\nTele-Cocooning is a term developed by Ichiyo Habuchi in 2005 to describe intimate human computer interaction, specifically in reference to \"the communication of one person to the next without having physical interaction with that person\".\n\nIn 2014, an academic study of Japanese youth supported the \"tele-cocooning hypothesis\", which contends that mobile \"texting is associated with increasingly insular communication because it strengthens core ties at the expense of interactions with lesser-known weak ties.\" The study says that research from many sources showed that texting among youth usually involves \"the intensive exchange of text messages among intimate and homogeneous peers.\" This decreases social tolerance and trust.\n\nA 2015 follow up study concluded that tele-cocooning behavior could be mitigated with smartphone applications stimulating interaction with communication weak ties through on-screen reminders.\n\nIn her 1991 book, The Popcorn Report, Popcorn describes cocooning as: \"the impulse to go inside when it just gets too tough and scary outside. To pull a shell of safety around yourself, so you're not at the mercy of a mean, unpredictable world - those harassments and assaults that run the gamut from rude waiters and noise pollution to crack-crime, recession and AIDS. Cocooning is about insulation and avoidance, peace and protection, coziness and control-a sort of hyper-nesting.\"\n\nIn the 1991 book, Popcorn argues that since she had defined the trend it had been substantiated by subsequent skyrocketing VCR sales; declining restaurant sales just as take out restaurant sales substantially grew; the emergence of \"shelter\" magazines; screening calls; and the increase in birth rates.\n\nPopcorn described three sub-trends within cocooning: the armored cocoon, the wandering cocoon, and the socialized cocoon.\n\nIndicators of the \"armored cocoon\" included greater gun ownership among women, and the growth in \"paranoia\" industries. These include home security systems, computerized watchdog systems linked to private guards and emergency help, anti-snooping devices, home warehousing of supplies and home delivery of food and other supplies to \"stock the cocoon.\"\n\nThe \"wandering cocoon\" is characterized by controlling one's environment when outside the home, such as car and mini-van design intended to make automobiles more pleasurable and livable. Signs of the \"mobile cocoon\" included people eating more meals in their cars; conducting business and \"life maintenance chores\" over the phone while driving; and the increase in airline security.\n\nThe \"socialized cocoon\" is characterized by surrounding oneself with \"soothing, congenial\" friends in one's \"home cocoon.\" Rather than entertaining at home as in the past, the socialized cocoon is characterized by selective invitations to a few close friends. Signs included a surge in book clubs, watching television with friends. The 1991 trend was described as \"nascent.\"\n\nIn her 1997 book, \"Clicking: 17 Trends That Drive Your Business--And Your Life,\" Popcorn asserted that the cocooning trend would give rise to 24-hour, comprehensive home banking.\n\nWilliam A. Sherden, in his 1999 book \"The Fortune Sellers: The Big Business of Buying and Selling Predictions\", takes a skeptical view of Popcorn's ideas about cocooning and concludes she was wrong on several issues. Sherden's statistics show double digit percentage growth in activities outside the home in the five years following her prediction.\n\nIn 2003, in the \"Encyclopedia of Community: From the Village to the Virtual World\", authors David Levinson and Karen Christensen note that cocooning has intensified with the growth of the internet because people can stay at home for weeks at a time without losing touch with friends, getting food to eat, working or watching recent movies. The authors cite the growth of home entertainment as a significant factor in cocooning, with people treating large casts of fictional characters as a \"surrogate community.\" While they saw no evidence of people entertaining at home more, in the wake of September 11, they said that people traveled less, stayed closer to home and spent more time with their families.\n\nA German economics book in 2009 titled \"Cocooning: My Home is My Castle\" asserted that in times of crisis people prefer to \"hedgehog\" at home and forecast good commercial prospects for chocolate, snacks, ready-made-meals and home furniture.\n\nA self-help book from 2010, \"The One Year Book of Inspiration for Girlfriends\", advocates cocooning as a form of religious retreat.\n\nIn 2014, authors Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong tie cocooning to the trend for larger homes. Rather than using amenities like public pools, parks and movie theaters, and participate in community activities like church and school functions, the authors contended that more people were retreating to large homes designed as a safe and pleasant refuge.\n\n\n"}

These festivals sometimes took on a high importance.

The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.\n\nEstonian language planners such as Ado Grenzstein (a journalist active in Estonia in the 1870s–90s) tried to use formation \"ex nihilo\", \"Urschöpfung\", i.e. they created new words out of nothing. Examples are Ado Grenzstein's coinages \"kabe\" ‘draughts, chequers’ and \"male\" ‘chess’.\n\nThe most famous reformer of Estonian, Johannes Aavik (1880–1973), also used creations \"ex nihilo\" (cf. ‘free constructions’, Tauli 1977), along with other sources of lexical enrichment such as derivations, compositions and loanwords (often from Finnish; cf. Saareste and Raun 1965: 76). Aavik belonged to the so-called Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’) movement, which appeared in Tartu, a university town in south-eastern Estonia, around 1905 (for discussion, see Raun 1991). In Aavik’s dictionary (1921), which lists approximately 4000 words, there are many words which were (allegedly) created \"ex nihilo\". Consider • \"ese\" ‘object’, • \"kolp\" ‘skull’, • \"liibuma\" ‘to cling’, • \"naasma\" ‘to return, come back’, • \"nõme\" ‘stupid, dull’, • \"range\" ‘strict’, • \"reetma\" ‘to betray’, • \"solge\" ‘slim, flexible, graceful’ (which did not gain currency, cf. Contemporary Estonian \"graatsiline\" ‘graceful’, although the word itself is used for a parasitic worm, namely Ascaris lumbricoides), and • \"veenma\" ‘to convince’. Other Aavikisms \"ex nihilo\" (not appearing in Aavik 1921) include • \"nentima\" ‘to admit, state’, • \"nördima\" ‘to grow indignant’, • \"süüme\" ‘conscience’, and • \"tõik\" ‘fact’.\"\n\nNote, however, that many of the coinages that have been considered (often by Aavik himself) as words concocted \"ex nihilo\" could well have been influenced by foreign lexical items, for example words from Russian, German, French, Finnish, English and Swedish. Aavik had a broad classical education and knew Ancient Greek, Latin and French. Consider • \"relv\" ‘weapon’ versus English \"revolver\", • \"roim\" ‘crime’ versus English \"crime\", • \"siiras\" ‘sincere’ versus English \"sincere\"/\"serious\" • \"embama\" ‘to embrace’ versus English \"embrace\", and • \"taunima\" ‘to condemn, disapprove’ versus Finnish \"tuomita\" ‘to judge’ (these Aavikisms appear in Aavik’s 1921 dictionary). Consider also • \"evima\" ‘to have, possess, own’ (cf. also Estonian \"omama\" ‘to own’, and \"mul on\", lit. ‘to me is’, i.e. ‘for me there is’, meaning ‘I have’) versus English \"have\"; • \"laup\" ‘forehead’ versus Russian лоб lob ‘forehead’; • \"mõrv\" ‘murder’ and \"mõrvama\" ‘to murder’ versus English \"murder\" and German \"Mord\" (these Aavikisms do not appear in Aavik 1921); and • \"laip\" ‘corpse’ versus German \"Leib\" ‘body’ and German \"Leiche\" ‘body, corpse’. These words might be better regarded as a peculiar manifestation of morpho-phonemic adaptation of a foreign lexical item. The often irregular and arbitrary sound changes could then be explained not as subconscious foreign influence but rather as conscious manipulation by the coiner. Aavik seems to have paid little attention to the origin of his neologisms. On occasion, he replaced existing native words or expressions with neologisms of foreign descent. Therefore, Aavik cannot be considered a purist in the traditional sense, i.e. he was not ‘anti-foreignisms/loanwords’ as such.\n\nInherited vocabulary in Estonian can be classified according to how far off they have cognates among the other Uralic languages.\nAll these groups correspond to different proposed subgroups of the Uralic languages. However, the historical reality of most groupings is disputed. In principle e.g. a \"Finno-Permic\" word may be just as old as a \"Uralic\" word, just one whose descendants have not survived to the modern Samoyedic and Ugric languages.\n"}

It was also used by nationalists in the 20th century.\n\nOriginally a Norse greeting, “heil og sæl” had the form “heill ok sæll” when addressed to a man and “heil ok sæl” when addressed to a woman. Other versions were “ver heill ok sæll” (lit. \"be healthy and happy\") and simply “heill” (lit. \"healthy\").\n\nThe Norwegian adjective \"heil\" (also \"hel\") is related to the English adjective \"whole\"/\"hale\". The Norwegian verb \"heile\" (also \"hele\") is related to the English verb \"heal\" through their common origin, the Germanic word stem \"*haila-\", from which even the German verb \"heilen\" descends.\n\nThe Norwegian adjective \"sæl\", meaning \"happy\" or \"glad\", is in Old English documented only in the negated variant \"unsǣle\", meaning \"evil\".\n\nAccording to \"Store norske leksikon\", the originally Norse greeting “heill ok sæll” was—adjusted to modern orthography and pronunciation—adopted as “heil og sæl” by the political party Nasjonal Samling. According to \"Bokmålsordboka\", the adoption was inspired by Germany's “Heil Hitler” and similar.\n\nDuring the 1940–1945 German occupation of Norway, Nasjonal Samling, being the governing and only legal political party, sought to introduce all parts of society to a greeting combining “heil og sæl” and a raised right hand. Whilst the attempt was not successful, the said greeting remained compulsory for party members and police. It has subsequently remained closely associated with nationalism.\n\n"}
{"id": "26175384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26175384", "title": "Itsekiri language", "text": "Itsekiri language\n\nThe Itsekiri language is a major branch of the Yoruboid group of languages, which as a group, is a key member of the Volta–Niger sub-family of the Niger–Congo family of African languages. Itsekiri is spoken by nearly 900,000 people in Nigeria as a first language and by many others as an additional language notably in the Niger Delta and in parts of Edo and Ondo states of Nigeria. The other key members of the Yoruboid group are Yoruba (22 million) and Igala (1.8 million) along with the various Yoruba dialects spoken in Benin and Togo.\n\nItsekiri is most closely related to the Yoruba dialects of south western Nigeria with which it shares close similarity in grammar, lexicon and syntax. Itsekiri represents one end of a continuum of Yoruba dialects from the northern Yoruba lands of Oyo and Offa to the western reaches of the Niger-Delta. In many ways standard Yoruba and Itsekiri may be considered official variants of the same language. Although Itsekiri and the South Eastern Yoruba dialects are mutually intelligible to varying degrees depending on proximity to each other, however, unlike Yoruba dialect speakers, native Itsekiri speakers do not recognise or use the standard Yoruba language as their official lingua franca. This may be owing to the historical isolation of the main body of Itsekiri speakers (in the Niger Delta) from the continuum of Yoruba speakers and centuries of developing a separate and distinct Itsekiri socio-cultural and national identity. Nevertheless, from a linguistic standpoint, both Itsekiri and standard Yoruba (based on the Oyo dialect) can be considered to represent two official variants of what is essentially the same language - one is a Southern Yoruba dialectal fusion of Ijebu, Ondo, Owo - spoken as a national language by under a million people and the other a fusion of Oyo and Eko dialects now spoken as a standard language by over 20 million people.\n\nItsekiri is most closely related to Yoruba and Igala and incorporates elements of both languages. It has also been very heavily influenced by Edo (Bini), Portuguese and English and has taken in loan words from neighbouring Ijo and Urhobo languages. However its basic structure, grammar and vocabulary is essentially Yoruboid with its closest relatives being the south-eastern family of Yoruba dialects - Ijebu, Ilaje-Ikale, Ondo, Akure and Owo. Whilst closely resembling those dialects however the Itsekiri language also features elements of Northern Yoruba notably The Ife and Oyo dialects. It is generally believed that the Itsekiri Language has developed out of an amalgam of languages spoken by various groups present in the western Niger-delta at the time of the formation of the Itsekiri nation in the 15th century. Because it has developed in the relative isolation of the Niger-Delta away from the main body of Yoruba dialects and from Igala - Itsekiri like most languages (that develop away from the main family body e.g. Icelandic) has preserved many of the original/archaic features of the original proto-Yoruba-Igala language and in particular the old Ijebu dialect of Yoruba. It is also possible that Itsekiri represents a surviving remnant of what could once have been the original Yoruba-Igala language before the split into separate languages.\n\nItsekiri is important to philologists and linguists today because of its role in comparative linguistics and in particular the study of the development of the Yoruba language. The Yoruba, English and Pidgin-English languages remain key modern-day influences on the development of the Itsekiri language today.\n"}

Of these, English, which was inherited from the colonial era, is the official language and lingua franca. Of the languages indigenous to Ghana, Akan is the most widely spoken.\n\nGhana has more than seventy ethnic groups, each with its own distinct language. Languages that belong to the same ethnic group are usually mutually intelligible. The Dagbanli and Mampelle languages of Northern Region, for instance, are mutually intelligible with the Frafra and Waali languages of the Upper East Region of Ghana. These four languages are of Mole-Dagbani ethnicity. \n\nEleven languages have the status of government-sponsored languages: four Akan ethnic languages (Akuapem Twi, Asante Twi, Mfantse and Nzema) and two Mole-Dagbani ethnic languages (Dagaare and Dagbanli). The rest are Ewe, Dangme, Ga, Gonja, and Kasem, Hausa.\nThere are nine government-sponsored languages. They are supported by the Bureau of Ghana Languages, which was established in 1951 and publishes materials in them. During the periods when Ghanaian languages were used in primary education, these were the languages which were used. All eleven(11) languages belong to the Niger–Congo language family, though to several different branches.\n\nAs part of the Kwa branch of the Niger–Congo family, the Akan languages appear in a diverse number of dialects. With regard to official status however, only three (3) are recognised; Asante Twi, Fante and Akuapem Twi.

{"id": "10016937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10016937", "title": "Languages of Norway", "text": "Languages of Norway\n\nThere is a large number of languages spoken in Norway. Of these, the Norwegian language is the most widely spoken and the main official language of the country.\n\nThe most widely spoken language in Norway is Norwegian. It is a North Germanic language, closely related to Swedish and Danish, all linguistic descendants of Old Norse. Norwegian is used by some 95% of the population as a first language. The language has two separate written standards: Nynorsk (\"New Norwegian\", \"New\" in the sense of contemporary or modern) and Bokmål (\"Book Language/Tongue/Speech\"), both of which are official.\n\nKnown as \"Språkstriden\" in Norwegian, the Norwegian language struggle is a movement rooted in both Norwegian nationalism and the 400 years of Danish rule in Norway (\"see Denmark-Norway\"). The koiné language (mixed language) known as Dano-Norwegian (\"Dansk-Norsk\") which developed in Norwegian cities was the result of Danish replacing Norwegian as the language of the upper classes in that country (Danish was used in the courts of law and by the ruling class, and after the Lutheran Reformation of 1536 it replaced Latin as a liturgical language). The adoption of Norwegian orthography into the Danish language gave rise to the written standard of Riksmål, which later became Bokmål. Nynorsk, a new standard of Norwegian based upon the spoken language in rural Norway, was acknowledged by the parliament in 1885, and in 1892 it was first possible to use Nynorsk as a language of primary instruction. By 1920, Nynorsk was being used widely in western Norway and the mountain valleys, where it still has its stronghold, and Bokmål was used in the more populous areas of the country. Later, attempts were made to reconcile the two standards into \"Samnorsk\", or \"Common Norwegian\", although this never came to fruition.\n\nBokmål, the written language of 80-90% of the Norwegian population, is based on Riksmål, although it differs in terms of genders, lexicon, counting system, a tendency to permit concrete noun endings in abstract situations and diphthongs versus single vowels. Riksmål was officially changed to Bokmål in 1929.\n\nNynorsk was developed by the linguist Ivar Aasen in the 1850s, based on rural, spoken Norwegian, rather than the cultured, Danish-influenced Norwegian spoken in cities. Its first official codification was in 1901, was given the name Nynorsk in 1929, and has been used officially (alongside Bokmål) since 1938. Its usage, however has declined: in 1944 it was used by 34.1% (highest recorded number), in 1971 by 17.5% of the population, today, some 15% of schoolchildren are taught Nynorsk as their written language, and Nynorsk is reportedly used as main form of Norwegian by around 7.4% of the total population, whereas an additional 5% switch between Bokmål and Nynorsk.\n\nA more conservative variation of Nynorsk exists, called Høgnorsk. It has few active users, but is supported by the Ivar Aasen-sambandet organization, founded in 1965 in response to the samnorsk policy of the government at the time.\n\nThe Sami people are indigenous to Northern Scandinavia, and though they have largely adopted Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, or Russian—due in no small part to official assimilation policies,— some still speak their indigenous Sami languages. Sami languages, like Kven and Finnish, belong to the Uralic language family. By far the most spoken form of Sami in Norway is North Sami (spoken by around 15,000 Norwegian Sami). The others are Lule Sami (spoken by around 500 in Norway), Pite Sami (which is nearly extinct) and South Sami (which has around 300 speakers in Norway). Sami and Norwegian are the official languages of Norway, and Sami is protected by the constitution.\n\nSpoken by the Kven people, the Kven language is a Finnic language, closely related to Finnish, and spoken by some five to eight thousand people in northeastern Norway, particularly in Tromsø (in the county of Troms) and Finnmark. Mirroring the situation of Meänkieli in Sweden, Kven is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Finnish, and has a large degree of mutual intelligibility with the language.\n\nThe Romani people are a diaspora population originating in India, and today are spread across all of Europe. The Romani language, an Indo-European, Indo-Aryan language (related to other languages spoken in India today), is split into a great number of dialects. Two of these, Tavringer Romani and Vlax Romani, are spoken in Norway, by populations of 6,000 and 500, respectively. Scandoromani is another Romani dialect indigenous to Norway, as well as Sweden. Because of the wandering nature of the Roma people, there is no geographic stronghold of the Romani language in Norway.\n\nSpoken by the Norwegian Travellers, a gypsy population in Norway which intermarried with Romani and Yeniche (German Traveller) populations, the Norwegian Traveller language, also known as Rodi, is based on Norwegian, but has heavy borrowing from Northern Romani and Rotwelsch. There is no estimate on how many Norwegian Traveller speakers there are in Norway, but it is known that the language is alive.\n\nIn 2013, there were approximately 4.5 million people in Norway who were capable of conversing in English to some extent, out of a population of 5.1 million. The country currently scores in the top 5 of the EF English Proficiency Index along with its Nordic neighbours.\n\n"}

The Limbu refer to themselves as \"Yakthung\" and their language as \"Yakthungpan.\" Yakthungpan has four main dialects: Phedape, Chhathare, Tambarkhole and Panthare dialects.\n\nAmong four dialects and/or many dialects, the Phedape dialect is widely spoken and well understood by most Yakthungpan speakers. However, as there are some dominant Panthare scholars who have role to create knowledge and control knowledge in the Limbu communities, Panthare dialect is being popularised as a \"standard\" Limbu language. As Panthare Yakthungs are much more engaged in central political position and administrative positions, they are trying to introduce Panthare dialect as a Standard Yakthungpan.\n\nYakthungpan (Limbu language) is one of the major languages spoken and written in Nepal, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Sikkim, Bhutan, Burma, and Thailand. Today, linguists have reached the conclusion that Yakthungpan resembles Tibetan and Lepcha.\n\nBefore the introduction of the Sirijanga script among Limbu Kirats, the Róng script was popular in east Nepal, especially in the early Maurong state. The Sirijanga script had almost disappeared for 800 years and it was brought back into use by Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe of Tellok Sinam Limbuwan present day Nepal. The Limbu script is called 'Sirijanga' after the Limbu culture- hero Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe, who is credited with its invention.\n\nLimbu is spoken east of the Arun River in the following districts of Nepal (\"Ethnologue\").\n\n\nThe Limbu languages are divided into four dialects :\n\"Ethnologue\" lists the following dialects of Limbu.\n\n\nYanggrokke, Chaubise, and Charkhole are minor variants of the Panthare dialect. Phedappe and Tamorkhole are similar. Chattare is less well understood by other dialect speakers. The Limbu dialect spoken in Sikkim, India is the same as Panthare.\n\nLimbu language is one of the few Sino-Tibetan languages of the central Himalayas with their own scripts. The Limbu script or Sirijanga script was devised during the period of Buddhist expansion in Sikkim in the early 18th century when Limbuwan still constituted part of Sikkimese territory. The Limbu script was probably designed roughly at the same time as the Lepcha script (during the reign of the third King of Sikkim, Phyag-dor Nam-gyal (ca. 1700-1717)). However, it is widely believed that the Limbu script (Sirijanga) had been designed by the King Sirijanga in the 9th century. The Sirijanga script was later redesigned and re-introduced by Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe . As Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe spent most of his time in the development of Yakthungpan, Yatkhung culture, and Limbu script; he is considered as the reincarnation of the 9th century King Sirijanga.\n\nAs Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe was astoundingly influential person to spread Limbu script, culture, and language, Tasang monks feared him. Tasang monks feared that Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe might transform the social, cultural, and linguistic structure of Sikkim. Therefore, Tasang monks captured Sirijunga, bound him to a tree, and shot him to death with poisonous arrows.\n\nBoth Limbu and Lepcha were ostensibly devised with the intent of furthering the spread Buddhism. However, Sirijanga was a Limbu Buddhist who had studied under Sikkimese high Lamas. Sirijanga was given the title 'the Dorje Lama of Yangrup'.\n\nThe language and script's influential structure are mixture of Tibetan and Devanagari. Unlike most other Brahmic scripts, it does not have separate independent vowel characters, instead of using a vowel carrier letter with the appropriate dependent vowel attached.\n\nThe Limbu language and literature have been less practiced in Nepal since the last eighteenth century. The cultural identity of any community was taken as a threat to the national unification by ruling elites until the recent years. The use of Limbu alphabet was banned and the possession of Limbu writings outlawed. There were no specific laws about it, but the Security Act was enforced for such cases under the strong directives of Kathmandu.\n\nLimbu has its own unique writing system, which is similar to Tibetan and Sikkimese scripts. The Limbu script or Sirijunga script is unique and scientifically designed by King Sirijanga in the 9th century; it was later re-designed and popularized by Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe and his followers in the 18th century. Since teaching of Limbu/Yakthung language and writing was banned by the Khas-Hindus in Nepal after the \"Noon Pani Sandhi\" between the Limbuwan and Gorkha Kingdom (Prithvi Narayan Shah), far more Limbus are literate in Nepali than in Limbu in Nepal. Although many Limbu books were written in Devanagari and Roman (English), now Limbus/Yakthungs have well developed computerized writing system and many books are published in Limbu script or Sirijunga script.\n\nHistory of Kirat-Yakthung writing can be divided into the following ways:\n\n1. Classical Kirat-Yakthung period: King Sirijanga (9th century AD)\n\n2. The 18th century Kirat-Yakthunghang period: Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe and his cronies movement\n3. The 19th century Kirat-Yakthung writers and rhetors: Period of Jobhansing Limbu, Chyangresing Phedangba, Ranadwaj, and Jit Mohan (Brian Hudgson procured books and requested them to write histories, stories, narratives, culture, and so on)\n\n4. The 20th Century Kirat-Yakthung writers and rhetors: \ni. After the establishment of \"Yakthunghang Chumlung\" (1925); thereafter, several books were published. \nii. Limbu script was much more influenced by Devnagari script at this period. \niii. At the same time, both national and international linguists, researchers, and writers addressed the issued in this period. This period is period of inquiry, communication, discovery, and re/construction.\n\n5. Late 20th and 21st century Kirat-Yakthung writers and rhetors: This period denotes after the restoration of democracy in Nepal in 1990. Introduction of \"Anipan\" at school; many research and writing such as MA/MPhil theses and research reports; establishment of Limbu organization at the local and global level; period of delinking, relinking, and linking epistemologies.\n\nThe Limbu language has many papers and publications in circulation.\nTanchoppa (Morning Star), a monthly newspaper/magazine which has been published since 1995. There are many other literary publications.\nThe oldest known Limbu writings were collected from the Darjeeling district in the 1850s. They are the ancestors of the modern Limbu script. The writings are now a part of a collection in the India Library in London.\n\nIn Nepal, the Limbu language is taught on private initiative. The Government of Nepal has published \" Ani Paan\" text books in Limbu for Primary education from grades 1 to 5. Kirant Yakthung Chumlung teaches Limbu language and script in its own initiative.\n\nIn Sikkim, since late 1970s Limbu, in Limbu script has been offered in English medium schools as a vernacular language subject in areas populated by Limbus.

Modern descriptive linguistics is based on a structural approach to language, as exemplified in the work of Leonard Bloomfield and others.\n\nLinguistic description is often contrasted with linguistic prescription, which is found especially in education and in publishing. Prescription seeks to define standard language forms and give advice on effective language use, and can be thought of as a presentation of the fruits of descriptive research in a learnable form, though it also draws on more subjective aspects of language aesthetics. Prescription and description are complementary, but have different priorities and sometimes are seen to be in conflict. Description is sometimes distinguished from \"descriptivism\", which is then defined as the belief that description is more significant or important to teach, study, and practice than prescription.\n\nAs English-linguist Larry Andrews describes it, descriptive grammar is the linguistic approach that studies what a language is like, as opposed to prescriptive, which declares what a language should be like. In other words, descriptive grammarians focus analysis on how all sorts of people in all sorts of environments, usually in more casual, everyday settings, communicate, while prescriptive grammarians focus on the grammatical rules and structures predetermined by linguistic registers and figures of power for those who are under the control of said authorities to use. An example Andrews uses in his book is \"fewer than\" vs \"less than\". A descriptive grammarian would state that both statements are correct, as long as the receiver of the message can understand the meaning behind the statement. A prescriptive grammarian, on the other hand, would analyze the rules and conventions behind the statements made and determine which statement is correct according to those rules. Andrews also believes that although the majority of linguists would be descriptive grammarians, the majority of public school teachers tend to be prescriptive.\n\nAccurate description of real speech is a difficult problem, and linguists have often been reduced to approximations. Almost all linguistic theory has its origin in practical problems of descriptive linguistics. Phonology (and its theoretical developments, such as the phoneme) deals with the function and interpretation of sound in language. Syntax has developed to describe the rules concerning how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. Lexicology collects \"words\" and their derivations and transformations: it has not given rise to much generalized theory.\n\nAn extreme \"mentalist\" viewpoint denies that the linguistic description of a language can be done by anyone but a competent speaker. Such speakers have internalized something called \"linguistic competence\", which gives them the ability to extrapolate correctly from their experience new but correct expressions, and to reject expressions which do not convey meaning in the way the speaker intends. For example, an expression could be ambiguous, possibly leading to several different interpretations by the listener. Depending on the speaker's intent, ambiguity can be desirable (as in jokes and other humor) or not. \n\nA linguistic description is considered descriptively adequate if it achieves one or more of the following goals of descriptive linguistics:\n\n\n"}

It represents a geographical area of the United States under the terms of the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Civil Action number 82-0192 or any other geographic area designated as a LATA in the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc. Tariff FCC No. 4. that precipitated the breakup of the original AT&T into the \"Baby Bells\" or created since that time for wireline regulation.\n\nGenerally, a LATA represents an area within which a divested Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) is permitted to offer exchange telecommunications and exchange access services. Under the terms of the MFJ, the RBOCs are generally prohibited from providing services that originate in one LATA and terminate in another.\n\nLATA boundaries tend to be drawn around markets, and not necessarily along existing state or area code borders. Some LATAs cross over state boundaries, such as those for the New York metropolitan area and Greenwich, Connecticut; Chicago, Illinois; Portland, Oregon; and areas between Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Area codes and LATAs do not necessarily share boundaries; many LATAs exist in multiple area codes, and many area codes exist in multiple LATAs.\n\nOriginally, the LATAs were grouped into regions within which one particular RBOC was allowed to provide services. The LATAs in each of these regions are numbered beginning with the same digit. Generally, the LATAs were associated with carriers or other indications in the following manner:\n\nIn addition to this list, two local carriers were made independent: Cincinnati Bell in the Cincinnati area, and SNET (a former unit of AT&T, sold to Frontier) in Connecticut. These were assigned LATAs in the 9xx range.\n\nSince the breakup of the original AT&T in 1984, however, some amount of deregulation, as well as a number of phone company mergers, have blurred the significance of these regions. A number of new LATAs have been formed within these regions since their inception, most beginning with the digit 9.\n\nLATAs contribute to an often confusing aspect of long distance telephone service. Due to the various and overlapping regulatory limitations and inter-business arrangements, phone companies typically provide differing types of “long distance” service, each with potentially different rates:\nGiven the complexity of the legal and financial issues involved in each distinction, many long distance companies tend to not explain the details of these different rates, which can lead to billing questions from surprised customers.\n\nLocal carriers have various alternative terms for LATAs such as “Service Area” by Pacific Bell in California, or “Regional Calling Area” by Verizon in Maryland.\n\nIn order to facilitate the sharing of Telcordia telephone routing databases between countries, LATAs were later defined for the provinces of Canada, the other countries and territories of the North American Numbering Plan, and Mexico. Aside from U.S. territories, LATAs have no regulatory purpose in these areas. In 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission eliminated all Canadian provincial LATAs in favor of a single LATA for Canada (888).\n\nNo LATAs exist with a second digit of 0 or 1, which distinguished them from traditional area codes.\n\nThe city or place name given with some LATAs is the name given to identify the LATA, not the limit of its boundary. Generally this is the most significant metropolitan area in the LATA. In some cases, a LATA is named after the largest phone exchange in the LATA that was historically served by an RBOC. For example, the largest city in the Pahrump LATA in Nevada is Las Vegas. Since Las Vegas was not historically served by an RBOC, the LATA is named after the smaller town of Pahrump, which was historically served by Nevada Bell (now AT&T Inc.). Also, listing under a state does not necessarily limit the LATA's territory to that state; there may be overlaps as well as enclaves. Areas that include notable portions of other states are explained, but not all LATA state overlaps may be detailed.\n\nLATA boundaries are not always solidly defined. Inter-carrier agreements, change proposals to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and new wiring developments into rural areas can and do often alter the effective borders between LATAs. Many sources on LATA boundary information conflict with each other at detailed levels. Telcordia data may provide the most up-to-date details of LATA inclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs LATAs exist for US regulatory purposes, where they serve as a demarcation between intra-LATA calls (handled by regional Bell operating companies) and inter-LATA calls (handled by interstate long distance carriers such as AT&T), they have no legal significance in Canada.\n\nAs of 2000, all of Canada (except for non-geographic numbers) is identified as LATA 888.\n\nThe use of this LATA set to identify individual provinces is therefore deprecated:\n\nCanada does define local interconnection regions (LIR's), which determine where points of interconnection (POI) must be provided by competing local exchange and mobile carriers to provide local number portability. A Canadian LIR is geographically smaller than a US LATA, typically comparable in size to a small city's flat-rate local calling area or to an entire large regional municipality. In areas where a small-city Digital Multiplex System controls a group of remote switching centres, one for each surrounding village, the local interconnect region normally includes each exchange in the city plus all downstream remotes of those exchanges. In a Toronto-sized city, the LIR will include only the city itself.\n\nWhile the LIRs resemble local calling areas in geographic size, there are some key differences:\n\nOne example: The tiny unincorporated village of Beebe Plain, divided by the Quebec-Vermont border, is served by +1-819-876 Rock Island, Quebec, Canada (a remote station controlled from Magog) and +1-802-873 Derby Line, Vermont, USA (a remote station controlled from St. Johnsbury). Magog and St. Johnsbury are both a long-distance call from anywhere in Beebe Plain, even though Canadian subscribers can place local calls to Sherbrooke, US subscribers can locally call Newport and an international call within the village is local. An LIR assignment which follows network topology places the Canadian remote station in Magog's LIR, not Sherbrooke's LIR.\n\n\n"}

She was born on September 2, 1925 and died on February 6, 1998. She is known in non-Occitan-speaking France as Marcelle Delpastre.\n\nMarcela Delpastre was born on February 2, 1925 in Germont, near the \"commune\" of Chamberet in the \"département\" of Corrèze. The daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of local farmers, she grew up in the heart of Limousin’s countryside civilization. At home, she would hear and learn two languages: Occitan and French. She went to primary school in Surdoux and Saint-Léonard in Haute-Vienne and then to secondary school in Brive where she took a \"baccalauréat\" in philosophy and literature. She later entered the college of decorative arts of Limoges where she developed a strong liking for human shapes (faces and feminine curves) and beauty in general.\n\nIn 1945, she returned to the family farm in Germont where she spent the rest of her life working the land, something she did \"because one has to earn their daily bread\". In the meantime, whether milking the cows or driving a tractor, she’d still think of apt rhymes for the poems she wrote. Poetry accompanied her all day long and she’d always carry a wee jotter and a pen in her pocket. When inspiration came, when the words were there, fine and ready, Marcela took a break and immediately put them down on paper. Indeed, most of her masterpieces probably sprang from a bundle of straw in a stable or in the middle of a field.\n\nFrom the end of the 1940s to the early years of the following decade, as the exercise books in which she wrote her poems and thoughts were beginning to heap up, Marcela Delpastre sent some of her works to literary journals and arts reviews. She was greatly encouraged by the correspondence she engaged in. As her texts got published, Marcela grew increasingly famous among the well-read people of Limousin.\n\nIn the 1960s, Marcela Delpastre was the helpless witness of the death of her native village of Germont and the painful decline of the millennial farming civilization of Limousin. The tractors replaced the oxen, the machines did the hands and television the evening gatherings... With all of her heart, Marcela now immersed herself into the tales, the legends and the traditions of her home \"país\" and met with Robert Joudoux, from the \"Lemouzi\" magazine, and Jean Mouzat, another Occitan author.\n\nMarcela Delpastre’s first work in lenga d’òc was called \"La Lenga que tant me platz\" (\"The Language I Love So\"):\nFrom then on, Marcela decided to write in Limousin, both the tongue and the place, and about Limousin. In the aforementioned magazine were subsequently published a couple of poems, among which \"Lo Rossinhòl e l’eglantina\" (\"The Nightingale & the Wild Rose\") and \"Lo Chamin de tèrra\" (\"The Dirt Track\"). For an easier writing, she also learned the normalized Occitan spelling.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Marcela began collecting and re-inventing traditional tales from her native Limousin. The first book was published in 1970 and its title was: \"Los Contes dau Pueg Gerjant\" (\"The Tales of Mount Gerjant\"). At the same time, she did the work of an ethnologist and wrote, in French, \"Le Tombeau des ancêtres\" (\"The Tomb of Our Ancestors\") about the customs and beliefs surrounding local religious festivals and cults. In 1968, \"La Vinha dins l’òrt\" (\"The Vine in the Garden\") was released: this poem won an award at the Jaufre Rudel competition. Its French version, \"La Vigne dans le jardin\" was adapted for the stage by the Radio-Limoges drama company. They adapted more texts by Marcela Delpastre later in the decade, among which featured \"L’Homme éclaté\" (\"The Exploded Man\") and \"La Marche à l’étoile\" (\"Walking to the Star\"). Marcela kept on writing and published other poems in several reviews, such as \"Lemouzi\", \"Traces\", \"Poésie 1\", \"Vent Terral\" and \"Òc\".\n\nIn 1974, \"Saumes pagans\" (\"Pagan Psalms\") appeared in the collection called \"Messatges de l’IEO\". It’s with these poems that Marcela Delpastre truly gained recognition from the whole Occitan literary world. In \"Le Bourgeois et le paysan\" (\"The Bourgeois & the Farmer\") she went another step farther in portraying the customs, beliefs and oral tradition of Limousin, this time around the theme of fire. Later, in her \"Bestiari lemosin\" (\"The Limousin Bestiary\"), she focused on wild animals and cattle and mixed reality with mythology. By the end of the 1970s Marcela also met two very important men for her career: one is Micheu Chapduelh and the other is Jan dau Melhau. She regularly featured in their review, \"Lo Leberaubre\", and grew popular beyond the circle of her readers by giving her opinion in articles and interviews in the local Limousin press (\"Limousin Magazine\", \"La Montagne\", \"L’Écho\", \"Le Populaire\"...), but most of all, among Occitan activists thanks to magazines like \"Òc, Occitans\" and especially \"Connaissance des Pays d’Òc\", with Ives Roqueta’s help.\n\nIn the last years of her life, Marcela Delpastre (and her friend Jan dau Melhau) spent her time dusting off hundreds of unpublished texts. Suffering from Charcot disease, she died in her bed on February 6, 1998 in her Germont farm, where she was born, where she’d always stayed and worked. Jan dau Melhau, her sole legatee, has since released more of her writings for the Lo Chamin de Sent-Jaume publishing house. The poet’s works are kept at Limoges’s City Library.\n\nA poet, a story-teller, an author and an ethnologist, Marcela Delpastre is now considered one of the ten most important writers of the 20th century, alongside the likes of Joan Bodon, Bernat Manciet, Renat Nelli and Max Roqueta. The message of this woman, who never left her home land of Limousin, is one of universal significance, one that addresses everybody, and this is probably what makes her words so strong and beautiful.\n\n\n"}

This is primarily seen in nuclear reactors, where the release of high-energy neutrons causes the long-term degradation of the reactor materials. The embrittlement is caused by the microscopic movement of atoms that are hit by the neutrons, this same action also gives rise to neutron-induced swelling causes materials to grow in size, and the Wigner effect causes energy buildup in certain materials that can lead to sudden releases of energy.\n\nNeutron embrittlement mechanisms include:\n\nNeutron irradiation embrittlement limits the service life of reactor-pressure vessels (RPV) in nuclear power plants due to the degradation of reactor materials. In order to perform at high efficiency and safely contain coolant water at temperatures around 290ºC and pressures of ~7 MPa (for boiling water reactors) to 14 MPa (for pressurized water reactors), the RPV must be heavy-section steel. Due to regulations, RPV failure probabilities must be very low. To achieve sufficient safety, the design of the reactor assumes large cracks and extreme loading conditions. Under such conditions, a probable failure mode is rapid, catastrophic fracture if the vessel steel is brittle. Tough RPV base metals that are typically used are A302B, A533B plates, or A508 forgings; these are quenched and tempered, low-alloy steels with primarily tempered bainitic microstructures. Over the past few decades, RPV embrittlement has been addressed by the use of tougher steels with lower trace impurity contents, the decrease of neutron flux that the vessel is subject to, and the elimination of beltline welds. However, embrittlement remains an issue for older reactors.\n\nPressurized water reactors are more susceptible to embrittlement than boiling water reactors. This is due to PWRs sustaining more neutron impacts. To counteract this, many PWRs have a specific core design that reduces the number of neutrons hitting the vessel wall. Moreover, PWR designs must be especially mindful of embrittlement because of pressurized thermal shock, an accident scenario that occurs when cold water enters a pressurized reactor vessel, introducing large thermal stress. This thermal stress may cause fracture if the reactor vessel is sufficiently brittle.\n\n\n"}

He is considered as an important figure of the Gujarati literature as well as Gujarati novel writing. He wrote 27 novels, among which, \"Bharelo Agni\" and \"Gramalakshmi\" is considered to be his magnum opus. His other notable and massive work is \"Apsara\", a essays divided in five volume which is based on the life of prostitutes. He was awarded Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak in 1932.\n\nDesai was born on 12 May 1892 in Sinor, a village located on the bank of Narmada river to Vasantlal and Manibai. His family was a native of Kalol of Panchmahal district. His father Vasantlal was agnostic in nature while his mother Manibai was vaishanva and religious. Vasantlal run a Gujarati magazine, \"Deshbhakta\" (Lit. The Patriot). Beside the printing house of his father Vasantlal, there was a book shop which provided him books for reading during his school life. Desai studied until sixth standard at his uncle's home in Shinor and then moved to Vadodara in 1902 and was admitted in the Branch School. He was engaged with Kailasvati at age of eight and they married in 1912.\n\nHe matriculated in 1908 and shifted to Vadodara college where he failed in Mathematics both in the first year and inter year exams. He used to discuss with friends about topics like Socialism, Communism and marriage and delivered lectures on these topics. His poem \"Shu Karu?\" (Lit. What should I do?) was published in a college magazine and later published in his poetry collection \"Niharika\". He passed B.A. in 1914 with the first rank and selected as a fellow. He wrote a play entitled \"Samyukta\" which was staged at Gujarati Sahitya Parishad held at Surat in 1915. He completed Master of Arts in 1916 with English and Gujarati literature. He could not get second rank and thus he could not fulfill his dream to be a professor. He joined Shri Sayaji High School as a teacher, and few months later, in November 1916, he was appointed as the head clerk in the Baroda State, where he later held various positions before retiring in 1948. He died on 20 September 1954 due to heart failure.\n\nDesai was the president of Pragatishil Sahitya Mandal and also of the Baroda Sahitya Sabha in 1937.\n\nHis son, Akshay Desai, was a renowned Indian sociologist.\n\nDesai was the contemporary of Gujarati novelists K M Munshi and Dhumketu. Desai mostly known for his novels depicting the Gujarati middle class life and characters. He has also written short stories, plays, poems, character-sketches, travelogues, historical essays, literary criticism and autobiography.\n\n\"Samyukta\", a play, was the first literary writing of Desai. His first novel \"Thaug\" (1924-1925) was serialized in \"Navagujarat\", a Gujarati magazine.\n\nDesai had written 27 novels.\n\n\"Jayanta\" was his first novel to be published in book form. His last novel \"Aankh ane Anjan\" was published posthumously in 1960. All of his novels can be divided in three groups. The first group, contains 8 novels, is based on historical and mythological themes. The second group of 12 novels deals with the social life of Gujarat and the ideas and activities of Mahatma Gandhi. The third group, consist of 7 novels published after 1941, influenced by Marxist ideology.\nHe serialized all his novels in periodicals. After G M Tripathi, Desai was the first Gujarati novelist who wrote his novels with historical events that shaped the contemporary mailieu. He deeply studied about particular historical era before writing these novels and he also visited some places, which is depicted in these novels, so that he could write an authentic description of the places. Desai's novels reflects the ideas and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi, though he had never met Gandhi. He depicted the spirit of the days of freedom struggle of India.\n\nHis novels, which have historical or mythical themes, includes \"Bharelo Agni\" (1935), \"Kshitij\" Vol 1‐2 (1938, 1941), \"Thug\" (1938), \"Pahadna Pushpo\" Vol 1‐2 (1943, 1949), Kalbhoj\" (1950), \"Shauryatarpan\" (1951), \"Balajogan\" (1952) and \"Shachi Pulomi\" (1954), among which \"Bharelo Agni\", considered to be Desai's magnum opus, is dealt with the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\n\"Sirisha\" (1927), \"Kokila\" (1928), \"Divyachakshu\" (1932) and \"Gramalakshmi\" (Vol. 1-4, 1933-1937) are considered as his major novels which dealing with Gandhian themes like Indian freedom movement, the removal of untouchability, the uplift of woman, the reconstruction of rural India, the \"Swadeshi Movement\", non-violent resistance and other things which Gandhi had preached and practised.\nBut Desai is also acclaimed for his social novels, which are characterized by human emotions like love, hate, compassion, revenge, tolerance and impatience with the social, economic and political problems of his days. Through his social novel, Desai suggest that these problems can be solved by following the Gandhian ideals. His novel \"Divyachakshu\" (1932) present the documentary picture of the days of freedom struggle with the backdrop of triangular love story. \"Purnima\" (1932) is a story of young girl who was driven to prostitution by her elders and the circumstances. \"Gramalakshmi\" Vol. 1-4 (1933-1937) is considered as his most expensive as well as the most idealistic novel. Consist of 1233 pages, it deals with almost every conceivable ill of the rural society. His othe social novels are Sirisha (1927), Hridayanatha (1930), Bamsari (1933), Patralalasa (1934), Snehayajna (1931), Sobhana (1939) and Hridayavibhuti (1940).\n\nDuring the later years of his life, Desai indulged towards Marxism and wrote novel based on it like \"Chhayanat\" (1941), \"Jhanjhavat\" Vol 1‐2 (1948, 1949), \"Pralay\" (1950) Saundaryajyot(1951), Snehasrishti(1953), Trishanku(1955) and Aankh ane Anjan (1960).\n\nHis play \"Samyukta\" (1923) was followed by \"Sankita Hridaya\" (1925), \"Anjani\" (1938), \"Pari Ane Rajakumar\" (1938), \"Gramaseva\" (1941), \"Tapa Ane Rupa\" (1950), \"Pushponi Shrishtima\" (1952), \"Uskerayelo Atma\" (1954), \"Kavidarshan\" (1957), \"Baiju Bavaro\" (1959) and \"Videhi\" (1960). The first three and \"Gramaseva\" are full length plays while the rest are short plays and one-act plays. This plays have played an important role in the development of the Gujarati theatre. In his play \"Sankit Hriday\", in which Jayshankar Sundari played a role.\n\nHe wrote about 140 short stories but, as the \"Encyclopedia of Indian Literature\" noted, he has not been able to contribute substantially to the development of Gujarati short stories. Beacuase he wrote his most of the short stories for popular periodicals of his era. His short stories have been collected in some volumes including \"Jhakal\" (1932), \"Pankaja\" (1935), \"Rasabindu\" (1942), \"Kanchan ane Geru\" (1949), \"Divadi\" (1951), \"Bhagyachakra\" (1952), \"Sati ane Svarga\" (1953), \"Dhabakata Haiya\" (1954) and \"Hirani Chamak\" (1957).\n\nDesai wrote his autobiography under the titles \"Gaikal\" (1950) and \"Madhyahan Na Mrigjal\" (1956).\n\nHis work \"Apsara\" (1933-1949) in five volume is a study of the life of prostitutes.\n\nDesai's novels \"Kokila\", \"Divya Chakshu\" and some other books were translated into Hindi, Marathi and in other Indian languages. The 1937 Hindi film Kokila, directed by Sarvottam Badami, was based on Desai's novel by same name. His other novel \"Purnima\" was also adapted into the film.\n\nVishwanath Bhatt, a Gujarati critic, considered Desai as the 'Yugamoorti Vartakar' (the novelist who reflects an age). Desai was awarded Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak in 1932 for his contribution in Gujarati literature. He also received Hargovinddas Kantawala Prize for his novel \"Divya Chakshu\".\n\n"}

{"id": "25527137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25527137", "title": "Second-language attrition", "text": "Second-language attrition\n\nSecond-language attrition is the decline of second-language skills, which occurs whenever the learner uses the second language to an insufficient degree (de Bot & Weltens 1991:43) or due to environmental changes the language use is limited and another language is becoming the dominant one (Olshtain 1989: 151).\n\nA German researcher, Schöpper-Grabe, once expressed that, \"Almost everybody who has learned a foreign language shares the experience of forgetting the acquired language skills once the period of formal instruction is over\" (Schöpper-Grabe 1998: 231). This relates to how second-language attrition can be defined as the \"non-pathological decrease in a language that had formerly been acquired by an individual\" (Köpke & Schmid 2004: 5) and described as the \"[…] loss of skills in the individual over time\" (de Bot & Weltens, 1995).\n\nBeginning in the 1970s until today, a new and especially young field in the area of second-language acquisition was developed. It is connected cross-sectionally throughout different research areas. Language attrition, in general, is concerned with what is lost (linguistic focus), how it is lost (psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic focus) and why it is lost (sociolinguistic, sociologistic and anthropologistic focus) (Hansen 1999). Over 25 years research has been concentrated on studying the attrition of second languages. First studies, dealing with the topic of language loss or language attrition, were published in the late 1970s (de Bot & Weltens 1989: 127). In 1980, the University of Pennsylvania hosted the conference \"The Loss of Language Skills\", and language attrition was recognized as a field in the research of second-language acquisition. Since then, various scientific research papers – mainly within America – have been published. Later, several studies in Europe – especially the Netherlands – followed. In other countries, however, language attrition research was paid hardly any attention (de Bot & Weltens 1995). Compared to the field of second-language acquisition, language attrition is still relatively young; so much is still unknown.\n\nThe purpose of language attrition, in general, is to discover how, why and what is lost when a language is forgotten. The aim in foreign or second-language attrition research is to find out why, after an active learning process, the language competence changes or even stops (Gleason 1982). Further, results from research in this area could, as Van Els and Weltens (1989) counter, contribute to the understanding of relations between acquisition and attrition (van Els 1989). L2/FL attrition research is particularly important because it provides results for foreign language instruction. De Bot and Weltens state, \"[r]esearch on language attrition can also have a considerable impact on curriculum planning or foreign language teaching\" (1995: 152). The theoretical grounding of the language attrition research derives primarily from cognitive and psychological theories. Research in the area of language attrition concentrates generally on the loss of the L1 and L2. The first distinction that can be made is between pathological and natural language attrition. The former concentrates on language loss caused by a damage of the brain, injury, age or illness. However, this topic will not be investigated any further, because the language attrition in these cases is not caused by natural circumstances. Weltens (1987: 24) states another possible distinction, inter and intra generational language attrition. Inter generational language attrition is concerned with attrition within individuals, whereas intra generational language attrition concentrates on the attrition across different generations. Van Els (1986) distinguishes types of attrition in terms of which language is lost and in which environment it is being lost. Therefore, he classifies:\n\nIt is not exactly known how different languages are stored in the mind. A researcher, Vivian Cook, proposes that the languages are separated into distinct compartments. This is termed the separation model. An L2 speaker will speak one of the languages, but no connection is made between them in the mind (Cook 2003: 7). Another proposed model is the integration model, which suggests that rather than having two separate mental lexicons, an L2 speaker has one lexicon where words from one language are stored from one language alongside words from the other. Regarding phonology, it has been found that L2 speakers sometimes have one merged system for producing speech, not distinguished by L1 or L2. The integration model focuses on how there is a balance between the unique elements of both languages, and how they form one system. Though these two proposed models offering different perspectives, it is impossible to have total separation because both languages exist in the same mind. Total integration is impossible because we are able to keep the languages apart in our minds (Cook 2003: 7). Another proposed model is the link language model. This model illustrates the idea that two languages within the same mind are able to influence and interact with one another. Further, the partial integration model illustrates the idea of partial overlapping between two languages in one mind. It doesn't differentiate between the languages in the overlap, but it shows how it functions as a single, conjoined system. These systems illustrate the point that vocabulary, syntax, and other aspects of language knowledge can be shared or overlapped between different languages within one mind (Cook 2003: 8). Finally, all of the models function together to create the integration continuum, an illustration that shows the possible relationships in \"multi-competence\" (Cook 2003: 9).\n\nThe L1 can be enhanced by the use of an L2 - Cook mentions that \"extensive research into bilingual development shows overall that L2 user children have more precocious metalinguistic skills than their monolingual pairs\" (Cook 2003: 13).\n\nThe L1 can be harmed by the use of an L2 - He also mentions brings up the risk of L1 language attrition from the L2. When one language is less and less used, certain abilities are lost from inactivity.\n\nThe L1 is different from the L2, without being better or worse - Oftentimes, the effects of the L2 on the L1 cause no difference in language knowledge or ability. Differences will undoubtedly exist in the first language element because of different linguistic organization. Different characteristics, like phonological properties, show noticeable differences from a speaker transitioning from L1 to L2. For example, Cook brings up the possibility of differences in \"the first language of L2 users for plosive consonants such as /p/ and /b/ or /k/ and /g/ across pairs of languages such as Spanish/English, French/English, and Hebrew/English, which are essentially undetectable in normal language use\" (Cook 2003: 13).\n\nResearchers, Levy, McVeigh, Marful, and Anderson studied the idea of a new acquired language inhibiting the first, native language. They discussed how \"travelers immersed in a new language often experience a surprising phenomenon: Words in their native tongue grow more difficult to recall over time\" (Levy 2007: 29). They suggest that the lapses in native-language words can possibly be attributed to \"an adaptive role of inhibitory control in hastening second-language acquisition\" (Levy 2007: 29). First-language attrition mostly affects the vocabulary is often worse during second-language immersion. During this time, the native-language is practiced infrequently. The attrition can be attributed to the disuse of the native language and functions of forgetting that occur in the mind. They bring up the idea that first-language attrition can be related to \"retrieval-induced-forgetting.\" This is supported by how novice foreign-language speakers immediately access native-language vocabulary for things, although the foreign word is wanted. The aforementioned researchers conducted studies on retrieval-induced forgetting, and examined \"whether inhibitory control mechanisms resolve interference from one's native language during foreign-language production\" (Levy 2007: 30). The results of their experiments provided evidence for a role of inhibitions in first-language attrition. The experiment showed that \"the more often novice Spanish speakers named objects in Spanish, the worse their later production of the corresponding English names became\", \"subjects who were least fluent with the Spanish vocabulary [they] test showed the largest phonological inhibition of English words\", and showed that the inhibition effect was isolated to phonology (Levy 2007: 33).\n\nTo provide an answer as to how second-language attrition happens, it is necessary to have a glance at the findings of the research of memory. Since its establishment by Ebbinghaus in the late 19th century, the empirical research about learning still plays an important role in the modern research of memory.\n\nHermann Ebbinghaus contributed a lot to the research of the memory of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a \"memory trace\" is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).\n\nThe interference theory can be seen as one of the most important theories of forgetting. It indicates that prior, posterior or new learning information compete with already existing ones and therefore forgetting occurs. This inhibition can be divided into two types: the retroactive inhibition, where information acquired at a later point in time blocks the information that was acquired earlier. Proactive inhibition means that information acquired in the past can infer with new information. Hence, a blocking can occur that inhibits the acquiring of the new target item (Ecke 2004: 325).\n\nToday, the retrieval-failure hypothesis, concerning the function of the memory, is more widely accepted and popularized (Schöpper-Grabe 1998:237). It says that the storage of information happens on different levels. Therefore, information or memory is not deleted, but rather, the access to the current level is blocked. Thus, the information is not available. Hansen quotes Loftus & Loftus (1976) to describe forgetting: \"[…] much like being unable to find something that we have misplaced somewhere\" (1999: 10). Cohen states, evidence for knowing that a learner is not able to \"find\" something, is the use of the so-called progressive retrieval (1986). Thereby, the learner is unable to express something that is in his mind and consequently uses an incorrect form. He eventually remembers the correct one (Cohen 1986; Olshtain 1989). Time is considered the decisive factor to measure how far the attrition has proceeded already (de Bot & Weltens, 1995).\n\nTo have a better understanding of language attrition, it is necessary to examine the various hypotheses that attempt to explain how language memory changes over time.\n\nThe regression hypothesis can be named as the first established theory in language loss. Its tradition goes far back, further than any other theory. The first researcher who designed it was Ribot in 1880. Later, Freud took Ribot's idea up again and related it to aphasia (Weltens & Schmid 2004: 211). In 1940, Roman Jakobson embedded it into a linguistic framework and claimed that language attrition is the mirror image of language acquisition (Weltens & Cohen 1989: 130). Even though only a few studies have tested this hypothesis, it is quite attractive to many researchers. As Weltens and Schmid (2004: 212) state, children acquire the language in stages. It was then suggested that language competence, in general, appears in different layers and therefore, attrition, as the mirror image of acquisition, will also happen from the top layer to the bottom.\n\nAccording to the regression hypothesis, two similar approaches developed. Cohen started to conduct several studies on his own to determine \"whether the last things learned are, in fact, the first things to be forgotten, and whether forgetting entails unlearning in reverse order from the original learning process\" (Cohen 1975: 128). He observed the attrition of Spanish, as the second language, among school children during the summer vacation. Cohen's results supported the regression hypothesis and his last-learned-first-forgotten thesis. It supported the idea that some things, which are learned last, are the first to be forgotten when the learner has no input of the target language anymore.\n\nAnother variation of the regression hypothesis is the best learned-last-forgotten hypothesis, which emphasizes the intensity and quality of the acquired knowledge, not the order in which it is learned. Therefore, the better something is learned, the longer it will remain. Because the language component is repeated again and again, it becomes automated and increases the probability that it will last in the memory (Schöpper-Grabe 1998: 241).\n\nThe linguistic-feature hypothesis was introduced by Andersen (Andersen 1982). He claims that second languages or foreign languages that share more differences with the respective mother tongue than similarities are more endangered to be forgotten than those similar to the L1. Another point is the attrition of components, which are less \"functional\", \"marked\" or \"frequent\" compared to other elements (Weltens & Cohen 1989: 130). This hypothesis is more differentiated and complex than the regression hypothesis because it considers aspects from first- and second-language acquisition research, language contact and aphasia research and the survey of pidgin and creole languages (Müller 1995). By means of this hypothesis research, it tries to detect the aspects of language that are first to be forgotten.\n\nTo define the process of language attrition, it is necessary to consider that there are different theories as to how the stages of language attrition occur.\n\nGardner (1982: 519-520) believes that the process of second-language attrition is divided into three points in time:\nBetween times 1 to 2 is termed the acquisition period. Between times 2 to 3 is termed the incubation period (1982: 520). Further, he states that it is not enough to consider only the time that has passed between 2 and 3 to make statements about attrition. It is also necessary to consider the duration, relative success, and nature of the acquisition period and the duration and content of the incubation phase (Gardner 1982: 520). The acquisition period is the time where language learning or language experience occurs, mainly from the first to the last lesson. During the incubation period, no language training or language usage occurs and the forgetting may begin. He says that now that language learning is not active anymore, a study about language attrition can be conducted (Gardner 1982a: 2).\n\nThe forgetting curve orientates itself on the typical forgetting curve by Ebbinghaus. He said that already after a very short amount of time, a forgetting process sets in immediately, stabilizes and then levels off. Bahrick conducted a study where he tested 773 persons with Spanish as their L2. His probates had varying acquisition and incubation periods, up to 50 years of non-active learning. He discovered a heavy attrition within the first 5 years, which then stabilized for the next 20 years (Weltens & Cohen 1989: 130). According to Bahrick, the knowledge that remained after 5 years is stored in the permastore. Neisser (1984) uses a different term, he prefers critical threshold, a level that has to be reached. Beyond that threshold, knowledge will resist decay. Contrary to these findings Weltens & Cohen (1989: 130) are reporting from studies where different results were found. According to these findings, the forgetting curve begins with an initial plateau, a period where the language competence is not affected at all. This is then followed by the onset of attrition. Weltens explains these results: it is by the high proficiency of the probates (bilinguals and immersion students). However, it is still unknown whether the curve that follows this plateau is potentially exactly like the \"normal\" forgetting curve of language learners with a lower proficiency level (Weltens & Cohen 1989: 130).\n\nAnother phenomenon is relearning. Some studies show that, despite the end of learning and no language input, a residual learning can happen. Weltens (1989), who studied foreign language learners, identifies an increase in reading and listening comprehension. He says that it happens because a process of maturation happens. Schöpper-Grabe determines that contact and the intensity with the target language cannot be the only variable causing language attrition (Schöpper-Grabe 1998).\n\nIn literature several factors are named for explaining why language competence is decreasing. Many researchers, however, regard the level of competence of the learner as essential for attrition. It is said that the higher the level of competence, the less attrition will occur. Thus, a reference to the theory of the critical threshold can be drawn. Similar to this theory it is claimed, that according to conducted studies, the higher the level of competence of the learner at the end of the incubation period, the fewer will be lost. Therefore duration, success and intensity of the language instruction or language input in general is vitally important. Weltens (1987) divides the factors influencing language attrition into three categories: characteristics of the acquisition process (method of instruction, length of exposure, proficiency before attrition, relationship between L1 and the FL), characteristics of the attrition period ('post exposure' and length of the attrition period), and learner characteristics. The second category are sociopsychological factors, as the attitude towards the target language and culture and aligned with the motivation for acquiring the language. Further, factors, which are settled in the language environment, should be considered as well, e.g. the status and prestige of the language are meaningful, too. Another frequent occurring factor is age. A variable that seems to be quite important, especially observing language attrition in children. Even though children are regarded as the better foreign language learner, their cognitive development is less progressed compared to adults. Further, usually they haven't learned to write or read in any language, and usually particularly not in the second language at all. Therefore their literacy skill in the L2 is very limited if not even there yet. Cohen (1989) conducted a study observing young children. He found out, that the attrition in an 8-year-old boy was stronger than the one in his 12-year-old sister. Tomiyama, suggested on the basis of her findings, that these children might not lose their knowledge of the L2 completely, moreover the access to such information is inaccessible and may vanish with time passing by. At the beginning of the 80s another, so far unnoticed factor, was introduced into the research field. Socioaffective factors as attitude, orientation and motivation are now accounted. On account of that, he established a socio-educational model of language acquisition. Thereby motivation and attitude influence the workload of the individual to keep their language competence. Further, individuals, who have positive attitudes towards the target language, seek possibilities and opportunities during the incubation period to retain their language competence (Gardner 1987: 521). However, the factor motivation is hardly considered examining language attrition. Especially during the last 10–15 years it became more and more acknowledged in the field of language acquisition rather than attrition. Only Gardner considered motivation as a possible factor influencing attrition. Even until today it is hardly recognised as an influencing factor and therefore exist only a few studies about motivation and its effects.\n\nFeuerhake (2004: 7) reports that, looking at released studies, that have been conducted, it can be seen that all four competence areas2 are affected. Though some of these seem more likely to be affected than others, e.g. grammar and lexical knowledge are more likely to suffer a high attrition process. Showing loss in speaking competence, the first evidence is that the speech tempo decreases. Longer and more frequently occurring speech pauses, under which the fluency is suffering, are observable as well (Gardner 1987). Olshtain (1986) observed \"[…] reduced accessibility in vocabulary retrieval in all situations of attrition where there is a reduction of language loss over longer periods of time.\" (1986: 163). Further, gaps concerning grammatical knowledge, especially tenses and conjunction of verbs occur quite frequently. Nevertheless, it can be said that productive skills are more affected than receptive ones, which mainly remain constantly stable (Cohen 1989) and if the learner shows already signs of language attrition it is more likely that transfer from L1 will happen (Berman & Olshtain 1983). Cohen examined in his studies several strategies, the learner applies to compensate the lack of adequate speaking skills, e.g. one strategy is code-switching, to uphold the communication. Another phenomenon observable is a kind of \"mixed-language\". Müller (1995) states that on many levels of speaking the learner falls back on a mixture between different languages. Still, it is important to mention, that, as with almost every study that has been conducted in the different sub-fields of second-language acquisition research, several problems arise. There are longitudinal vs. cross-sectional studies, different variables, which have been used, and mainly terms and conditions of acquisition and incubation period are not standardised, particularly the length of the incubation period (Feuerhake 2004: 8). That means, some studies only observe language attrition after language programs, other look at the attrition in between breaks of language programs and studies, which examine the attrition after change of environment, regarding language and living conditions (Cohen 1975, Olshtain 1989). Finally, studies reviewed in this paper show that attrition follows a certain order, e.g. productive skills are more affected than receptive skills. Mainly due to difficulties in lexical retrieval a loss in fluency seems to be the first signs of language attrition, followed by attrition in morphology and syntax. Further observations in language attrition are necessary, to give a better understanding of how the human mind deals with language (Hansen 1999: 78).\n\nThe following chapter is trying to explain motivation and its influence on language attrition. Until 1990 the sociopsychological model of Gardner dominated the research about motivation. Gardner and Lambert emphasise thereby the importance of attitude towards the language, the target country and language community (Feuerhake 2004).\n\nAccording to Gardner and Lambert (1972) a learner is instrumental orientated if learning a foreign language has a function, e.g. for success in career terms. Thereby, the language becomes an instrument to achieve the higher purpose and the foreign language learning is concentrated on fulfilling the aim of the learner (Feuerhake 2004: 9).The integrative orientation follows the aim of acculturating with the target language and country as well as the integration into the target language community.\n\nThe instrumental and integrative orientation is not enough to cover all aspects of the term motivation, the term intrinsic and extrinsic motivation was added to the model. The term intrinsic is connected with behaviour, which results from the reward of the activity itself. The learner acts, because he is enjoying the activity or it is satisfying his curiosity. Mainly it is self-determined and the learner is eager to learn a foreign language because he wants to achieve a certain level of competence. The learner enjoys learning and the acquisition of a foreign language is challenging. Extrinsic motivated learners are orientated on external stimuli, e.g. positive feedback or expectations from others. In general four different types of extrinsic motivation can be distinguished (Bahar 2005):\nBahar (2005: 66) quotes Pintrich & Schunk (1996), who state that \"[…] motivation involves various mental processes that lead to the initiation and maintenance of action […]\". Hence, motivation is a dynamic process that changes over time and the motivation of a learner as well might change during the learning process. Therefore, it cannot be seen as an isolated factor. Moreover, several other factors, which are settled within the learner, as well as in the environment, influence motivation and are responsible for its intensity and variability.\n\nGardner, Lalonde, & Moorcroft (1987) investigated the nature of L2-French skills attriting by L1-English grade 12 students during the summer vacation, and the role played by attitudes and motivation in promoting language achievement and language maintenance. Students who finished the L2 class highly proficient are more likely to retain what they knew. Yet high achievers in the classroom situation are no more likely to make efforts to use the L2 outside the classroom unless they have positive attitudes and high levels of motivation. The authors write: \"an underlying determinant of both acquisition and use is motivation\" (p. 44).\n\nIn fact, the nature of language acquisition is still so complex and so much is still unknown, not all students will have the same experiences during the incubation period. It is possible that some students will appear to attrite in some areas and others will appear to attrite in other areas. Some students will appear to maintain the level that they had previously achieved. And still, other students will appear to improve.\n\nMurtagh (2003) investigated retention and attrition of L2-Irish in Ireland with second level school students. At Time 1, she found that most participants were motivated instrumentally, yet the immersion students were most likely to be motivated integratively and they had the most positive attitudes towards learning Irish. Immersion school students were also more likely to have opportunities to use Irish outside the classroom/school environment. Self-reports correlated with ability. She concludes that the educational setting (immersion schools, for example) and the use of the language outside the classroom were the best predictors for L2-Irish acquisition. Eighteen months later, Murtagh finds that the majority of groups 1 and 2 believe their Irish ability has attrited, the immersion group less so. The results from the tests, however, do not show any overall attrition. \"Time\" as a factor did not exert any overall significant change on the sample's proficiency in Irish (Murtagh, 2003:159).\n\nFujita (2002), in a study evaluating attrition among bilingual Japanese children, says that a number of factors are seen as necessary to maintain the two languages in the returnee child. Those factors include: age on arrival in the L2 environment, length of residence in the L2 environment, and proficiency levels of the L1. Furthermore, she found that L2 attrition was closely related to another factor: age of the child on returning to the L1 environment. Children returning around or before 9 were more likely to attrite than those returning later.\nUpon returning from overseas, pressure from society, their family, their peers and themselves force returnee children to switch channels back to the L1 and they quickly make effort to attain the level of native-like L1 proficiency of their peers. At the same time, lack of L2 support in the schools in particular and in society in general results in an overall L2 loss.\n\n\n"}

The term is also used in anthropology, computational semiotics, and technical exegesis.\n\nBrinton (2000: p. 112) defines \"semantic field\" or \"semantic domain\" and relates the linguistic concept to hyponymy:\n\"Related to the concept of hyponymy, but more loosely defined, is the notion of a semantic field or domain. A semantic field denotes a segment of reality symbolized by a set of related words. The words in a semantic field share a common semantic property.\"\n\nA general and intuitive description is that words in a semantic field are not necessarily synonymous, but are all used to talk about the same general phenomenon. Synonymy requires the sharing of a sememe or seme, but the semantic field is a larger area surrounding those. A meaning of a word is dependent partly on its relation to other words in the same conceptual area. The kinds of semantic fields vary from culture to culture and anthropologists use them to study belief systems and reasoning across cultural groups.\n\nAndersen (1990: p. 327) identifies the traditional usage of \"semantic field\" theory as:\n\"Traditionally, semantic fields have been used for comparing the lexical structure of different languages and different states of the same language.\"\n\nThe origin of the field theory of semantics is the lexical field theory introduced by Jost Trier in the 1930s, although according to John Lyons it has historical roots in the ideas of Wilhelm von Humboldt and Johann Gottfried Herder. In the 1960s Stephen Ullmann saw semantic fields as crystallising and perpetuating the values of society. For John Lyons in the 1970s words related in any sense belonged to the same semantic field, and the semantic field was simply a lexical category, which he described as a lexical field. Lyons emphasised the distinction between semantic fields and semantic networks. In the 1980s Eva Kittay developed a semantic field theory of metaphor. This approach is based on the idea that the items in a semantic field have specific relations to other items in the same field, and that a metaphor works by re-ordering the relations of a field by mapping them on to the existing relations of another field. Sue Atkins and Charles J. Fillmore in the 1990s proposed frame semantics as an alternative to semantic field theory.\n\nThe semantic field of a given word shifts over time—see \"semantic shift\". For example, the English word \"man\" used to mean \"human being\" exclusively, while today it predominantly means \"adult male,\" but its semantic field still extends in some uses to the generic \"human\" (see Mannaz).\n\nOverlapping semantic fields are problematic, especially in translation. Words that have multiple meanings (called polysemous words) are often untranslatable, especially with all their connotations. Such words are frequently loaned instead of translated. Examples include \"chivalry\" (literally \"horsemanship\", related to \"cavalry\"), \"dharma\" (literally, \"support\"), and \"taboo\".\n\nSemantic field theory has informed the discourse of Anthropology as Ingold (1996: p. 127) relates:\n\"Semiology is not, of course, the same as semantics. Semiology is based on the idea that signs have meaning in relation to each other, such that a whole society is made up of relationally held meanings. But semantic fields do not stand in relations of opposition to each other, nor do they derive their distinctiveness in this way, nor indeed are they securely bounded at all. Rather, semantic fields are constantly flowing into each other. I may define a field of religion, but it soon becomes that of ethnic identity and then of politics and selfhood, and so on. In the very act of specifying semantic fields, people engage in an act of closure whereby they become conscious of what they have excluded and what they must therefore include.\"\n\n"}

For other irregular verbs and their common patterns, see the article on Spanish irregular verbs.\n\nThe tables include only the \"simple\" tenses (that is, those formed with a single word), and not the \"compound\" tenses (those formed with an auxiliary verb plus a non-finite form of the main verb), such as the progressive, perfect, and passive voice. The progressive aspects (also called \"continuous tenses\") are formed by using the appropriate tense of \"estar\" + gerund, and the perfect constructions are formed by using the appropriate tense of \"haber\" + past participle. When the past participle is used in this way, it invariably ends with \"-o\". In contrast, when the participle is used as an adjective, it agrees in gender and number with the noun modified. And similarly, the participle agrees with the subject when it is used with \"ser\" to form the \"true\" (dynamic) passive voice (e.g. \"La carta fue escrita ayer\" 'The letter was written [got written] yesterday.'), and also when it is used with \"estar\" to form a \"passive of result\", or stative passive (as in \"La carta ya está escrita\" 'The letter is already written.').\n\nThe pronouns \"yo, tú, vos, él, nosotros, vosotros\" and \"ellos\" are used to symbolise the three persons and two numbers. Note, however, that Spanish is a pro-drop language, and so it is the norm to omit subject pronouns when not needed for contrast or emphasis. Note also that the subject, if specified, can easily be something other than these pronouns. For example, \"él\", \"ella\", or \"usted\" can be replaced by a noun phrase, or the verb can appear with impersonal \"se\" and no subject (e.g. \"Aquí se vive bien\", 'One lives well here'). The first-person plural expressions \"nosotros\", \"nosotras\", \"tú y yo\", or \"él y yo\" can be replaced by a noun phrase that includes the speaker (e.g. \"Los estudiantes tenemos hambre\", 'We students are hungry'). The same comments hold for \"vosotros\" and \"ellos\".\n\nSometimes referred to by Spanish instructors as a \"Yo -go\" verb.\n\n"}
{"id": "5073322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5073322", "title": "Transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages", "text": "Transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, Australian Aboriginal languages had been purely spoken languages, and had no writing system. On their arrival, Latin script became a standard for transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages, but the details of how the sounds were represented has varied over time and from writer to writer, sometimes resulting in a great many variant spellings of the same word or name.\n\nAt first, Australian languages were written following English orthography as it sounded to the writer. This meant that sounds which were distinguished in Australian languages but not in English were written identically, while at the same time sounds which were allophones in Australian languages but distinct in English were written differently.\n\nMost Aboriginal words used in English follow these early conventions, and therefore do not usually give a good idea of how the word was pronounced in the original language.\nWriters with more linguistic knowledge sometimes employed symbols such as or for , for , macrons or circumflexes for long vowels, breves for short vowels, but these were often applied inconsistently.\n\nLinguists working with Australian languages today purposely use unambiguous phonemic orthographies based on detailed phonological analysis of the language in question. In orthographies of this kind each spoken word can only be written one way, and each written word can only be read one way.\n\nUsually, but not always, practical orthographies use just the letters of the basic Roman alphabet. This necessitates the use of digraphs for sounds that do not have a standard character. In some cases this can lead to ambiguities, for example where the single sound and the consonant cluster could both be written as . These are commonly distinguished by writing the cluster (inserting a full stop), (inserting an apostrophe), or .\n\nMost Australian languages distinguish just three vowels, which are written , and . Even though they may sound like or at times, they are not written or , e.g. the Martuthunira word \"wirrirri\" \"flame\" is pronounced as . Long vowels are represented by double letters, i.e. , , .\n\nThe semivowels and are usually pronounced as in English. In some languages, may not be pronounced next to , and next to , but for various reasons a linguist may still choose to write them, so that e.g. Gamilaraay \"yinarr\" \"woman\" is actually pronounced .\n\nA handful of languages have a dental semivowel, which is written (see Place of articulation below).\n\nMost Australian languages have two rhotics or \"r\"-like sounds: a retroflex approximant, as in American English, written ; and a trill or flap (both of which are found in Spanish), written .\n\nIn languages that have only one of the two r's, it is simply written .\n\nThe bilabial, velar and alveolar consonants are usually written the same as in English, i.e. , , , , , , , , , . may also be written using the non-English letter , called eng. Note that sounds like the \"ng\" in \"singer\", not as in \"finger;\" the latter would be written .\n\nPalatal consonants are often represented by a digraph made of an alveolar consonant + or , i.e. can be written /, /, /, and /. and are other possible ways of writing the palatal stops.\n\nDental consonants are represented by a digraph made of an alveolar consonant + , i.e. , , , . Note that is not a fricative as in Australian English, but a stop as in Irish English.\n\nRetroflex consonants are usually represented by a digraph made of + an alveolar consonant, i.e. , , , , as in Swedish. In some varieties, such as Pitjantjatjara, a digraph is not used and instead the alveolar consonant is underlined to indicate that it is retroflex thus: , and .\n\nA handful of languages have palato-velar consonants, between palatal and velar. For Yanyuwa, these are written , (a prenasalised stop—see Prenasalisation below), .\n\nMost Australian languages do not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops, so that e.g. \"t\" and \"d\" both occur as variants of the same sound. Both the voiced and voiceless allophone will usually be written the same way, but whether to use the voiceless symbol or the voiced symbol varies depending on which occurs more frequently in the language. Some languages have been written using the voiced symbols by one linguist and the voiceless symbols by another. Moreover, some linguists choose to use voiceless symbols for some consonants in a language and voiced symbols for others.\n\nSome languages do distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops, however.\n\nSome languages have prenasalized consonants, a stop preceded by a nasal sound which is considered one consonant. In Yanyuwa these are written , , , , , .\n\n"}
