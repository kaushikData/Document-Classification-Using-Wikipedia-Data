He was 4th of 7 brothers born to Jnan Ranjan and Parul Bala Dutta. He lost both his parents within a span of six months when he was 7, his youngest brother was 3. He and his brothers were then raised by their grandmother.\n\nFrom an early age, he was drawing, painting and writing poetry. He started publishing a hand written literary magazine that was passed along in the neighbourhood. When in high school, he and his friends started a \"Baroari Durga Puja\" and he made the idols for the first Puja there. A special feature of this Puja was that the Pandal was a veritable wall magazine. This in time became the \"Tarun Sangha Puja\" of Sahanagar which continues to this day.\n\nAfter completing the Matriculation from Sahanagar High School, he entered Government Art College, Kolkata but had to discontinue due to financial difficulties.\n\nThe following year, he enrolled at the Calcutta Art School (later to be known as Calcutta Art College) and graduated First Class First, winning the Gold Medal in 1955. His class mates tell the story that he was known amongst the students as \"Kabi\" (meaning poet) and it was widely expected that he would top the class.\n\nHe started a business on graphic design in 1956 named D G Press and Publicity Syndicate.\n\nThough occupied with his business of graphic designs and commercial art, he continued to work on his main interests, painting portraits and landscapes.\n\nIn 1979, he started his project \"Swakalbela\" \"(my own time)\" where he planned to paint portraits of 100 of his contemporaries. These series of portraits were painted directly with brush without any drawing and were completed in 2 or 3 sittings, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes. He completed 62 portraits. He was also writing a book about the subjects of these portraits.\n\nIn 1977, he started a literary magazine, originally titled \"Mukto Patra\". Later, he started a publishing business, naming that \"Mukto Patra Publications\" and renamed the magazine \"Shilpo O Sahitya\". As editor, he was always seeking out new and lesser known poets, authors and artists.\n\nIn 1986, he started the annual \"Shilpo O Sahitya\" awards for \"little magazines\". All Bengali little magazines published anywhere in the country were encouraged to enter and prizes were awarded in 5 categories, best poem, best short story, best non-fiction, best cover design, best editing.\n\nHe was a consultant on Restoration to the \"Academy of Fine Arts\" and a member of its Executive Committee. He recommended that the Academy of Fine Arts start a school on Art Education. Thus, the \"Institute of Visual Arts\" was founded and he was the first Principal.\n\nLater, he founded the \"Academy of Creative Art\", Kolkata in 1991 and was its first Principal. The Academy offers two programmes, and a One Year certificate programme aimed at young artists and a Three Year (deemed to be) Degree programme aimed at Senior Artists and those planning to be Art Teachers.\n\n"}

This project was conducted by an international group of phoneticians, and was applied in the first instance to the European Communities languages Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, and Italian (by 1989). SAM produced many speech research tools and a corpus of recorded speech material distributed on CD-ROM. A proposal was made to the European Union under the Copernicus initiative in 1994, with the objective of creating a corpus of spoken Bulgarian, Estonian, Hungarian, Polish and Romanian, and Grant #1304 was awarded for this. A pilot project to create a small corpus of spoken Bulgarian was carried out jointly by the Universities of Sofia (Bulgaria) and Reading (U.K.). The initial meeting of the whole project team took place at the University of Reading in 1995.\n\nSince the objective was to produce material suitable for use in speech technology applications, the digital recordings were made in strictly controlled conditions in recording studios.

The project was completed in December 1998. The resulting set of corpora was then supplied to the European Language Resources Association. ELRA is exclusively responsible for distributing the material to users via their website.\n\nAt the time of its completion, BABEL was the largest high-quality speech database available for research purposes in languages such as Hungarian and Estonian. It has been used for research into topics such as pronunciation modeling and automatic speech recognition. The project was also part of what has been called the most significant recent development in corpus linguistics – the increasing range of languages covered by corpus data, which promises to bring to a wider range of languages the benefits that corpus linguistics has brought to the study of Western European languages.\n"}
{"id": "1923472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923472", "title": "Bhoja", "text": "Bhoja\n\nBhoja (reigned c. 1010–1055 CE) was an Indian king from the Paramara dynasty. His kingdom was centered around the Malwa region in central India, where his capital Dhara-nagara (modern Dhar) was located. Bhoja fought wars with nearly all his neighbours in attempts to extend his kingdom, with varying degrees of success. At its zenith, his kingdom extended from Chittor in the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to Vidisha in the east.\n\nBhoja is best known as a patron of arts, literature, and sciences. The establishment of the Bhoj Shala, a centre for Sanskrit studies, is attributed to him. He was a polymath, and several books covering a wide range of topics are attributed to him. He is also said to have constructed a large number of Shiva temples, although Bhojeshwar Temple in Bhojpur (a city founded by him) is the only surviving temple that can be ascribed to him with certainty.\n\nBecause of his patronage to scholars, Bhoja became one of the most celebrated kings in the Indian history. After his death, he came to be featured in several legends as a righteous scholar-king. The body of legends clustered around him is comparable to that of the fabled Vikramaditya.\n\nBhoja's father and predecessor was Sindhuraja. According to \"Bhoja-Prabandha\", his mother's name was Savitri. Bhoja's reputation as a scholar-king suggests that he was well-educated as a child. The \"Bhoja-Prabandha\" states that he was educated by his guardians as well as other learned scholars.\n\nAccording to \"Bhoja-Prabandha\", early in his life, Bhoja suffered from intense headaches. Two Brahmin surgeons from Ujjain made him unconscious using an anaesthetic powder called \"moha-churna\", opened his cranial bone, removed a tumor, and then made him regain his consciousness by administering another powder called \"sanjivani\".\n\nAccording to \"Tilaka-Manjari\", composed by Bhoja's contemporary Dhanapala, Bhoja's feet had auspicious birthmarks indicating that he was fit to be a king. His uncle Munja (and his father's predecessor) loved him greatly, and appointed him as the king.\n\nHowever, several later legendary accounts state that Munja was initially jealous of Bhoja, and tried to prevent him from becoming a king. For example, the 14th century \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" states that during the reign of Munja, an astrologer prophesied Bhoja's long reign. Munja, who wanted his own son to become the king, ordered Bhoja's killing. Bhoja was appointed as the king by the royal ministers after Munja's death. According to a Gujarati legend documented in Rasmala, Munja ordered Bhoja's murder, but later appointed him as the crown prince.\n\n\"Bhoja-Prabandha\" states that Munja ordered one Vatsaraja to kill Bhoja at the Mahamaya temple in Bhuvaneshvari forest. On hearing Bhoja's cultured manner of talking, Vatsaraja and his men abandoned the murder plan. They faked Bhoja's death, and presented to Munja a fake head and a verse from Bhoja. The verse described how great kings like Mandhata, Rama and Yudhishthira died leaving behind all their property; it then sarcastically added that Munja would be the only one whom the earthly possessions would follow. The verse moved Munja to tears, and made him realize his mistake. When he learned that Bhoja was still alive, he invited Bhoja to back to his court. To repent for his sin, he also went on a pilgrimage to Dharmaranya, where he established a town called Munjapuram. The sarcastic verse, purportedly written by Bhoja to Munja, also appears as an antonymous extract in \"Sharngadhara-paddhati\" (1363 CE).\n\nThese stories of Bhoja's persecution by Munja are essentially mythical. This legend is not found in the works composed by the contemporaries of Munja, Sindhuraja and Bhoja. For example, the \"Nava-Sahasanka-Charita\" makes no mention of this story. The legend appears to be the poetic imagination of later composers. \"Ain-i-Akbari\" also contains a variation of this account, but completely distorts the legend, naming Munja as the one who was persecuted by Bhoja. This account is also completely unreliable from a historical point of view.\n\nSome literary works suggest that Bhoja succeeded his uncle Munja as the Paramara king. These works include \"Tilaka-Manjari\", \"Prabandha-Chintamani\", and \"Rasmala\". However, several other works as well as epigraphic evidence indicate that Bhoja succeeded his father Sindhuraja. Padmagupta, the court poet of Sindhuraja and Bhoja, also supports this fact. According to \"Bhoja-Prabandha\", Munja left the Paramara administration in hands of Sindhuraja before departing on a military expedition. Munja unexpectedly died in this campaign, and as a result, Sindhuraja succeeded him as the king. Sindhuraja's court poet Padmagupta, in his \"Nava-Sahasanka-Charita\", states that Munja \"placed the world in Sindhuraja's hands\" before leaving for Ambika's town. This indicates that he left the administration in Sindhuraja's hands before leaving for his fatal expedition against Tailapa II. \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription seems to confirm this.\n\nThe Modasa copper plates (1010–11 CE) are the earliest historical record of Bhoja's reign. The \"Chintamani-Sarnika\" (1055 CE) was composed by Bhoja's court poet Dasabala. An inscription of Bhoja's successor Jayasimha I is also dated 1055 CE. Thus, 1055 CE can be taken as the last year of Bhoja's reign. Based on these evidences, scholars such as Pratipal Bhatia assign Bhoja's reign to 1010–1055 CE.\n\nHowever, some scholars assign the beginning of Bhoja's reign variously between 1000 CE and 1010 CE, based on their interpretations of inscriptions and legendary texts. For example, Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" states that Bhoja ruled for 55 years, 7 months and 3 days Based on this, scholars such as D. C. Ganguly and K. C. Jain assign Bhoja's reign to 1000–1055 CE. However, as K. M. Munshi states, dates are \"the weakest point in Merutunga's narratives\".\n\nIn the Paramara inscriptions, Bhoja is mentioned as \"Bhoja-deva\". In some modern north Indian languages such as Hindi, he is also known as \"Bhoj\" (because of schwa deletion). Bhoja's inscriptions mention his titles as \"Parama-bhattaraka\", \"Maharajadhiraja\" and \"Parameshvara\". \"Ganaratna Mahodadhi\" (1140 CE), a work on grammar by Vardhamana, suggests that \"Tribhuvan Narayana\" or \"Triloka Narayana\" (\"Lord of the three worlds\") was also a title of Bhoja. This is corroborated by epigraphic evidence: the Shiva temple ascribed to Bhoja in the Chittor fort has an idol which was named \"Bhojasvamindeva\" as well as \"Tribhuvan Narayanadeva\".\n\n<mapframe text=\"Inscriptions from Bhoja's reign have been found in present-day Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan states of India\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" zoom=\"6\" longitude=\"75.18\" latitude=\"22.60\">\n</mapframe>\n\nWhile Bhoja became famous as a benevolent king and a patron of arts and culture, he was also renowned as a warrior. He inherited a kingdom centered around the Malwa region, and made several attempts to expand it with varying results. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription of Bhoja's brother claims that Bhoja ruled the land from the Himalayas in the North to Malabar in the south, which is an obvious exaggeration. Historical evidence indicates that Bhoja's kingdom extended from Chittor in the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to Vidisha in the east.\n\nSeveral legends mention conflicts between the ruler of Malwa and the Chaulukyas, during the reign of the Chaulukya kings Vallabha-raja and Durlabha-raja. Vallabha is said to have died of smallpox during an expedition against the Paramaras. This incident may have happened during the early part of Bhoja's reign, or during the reign of his father Sindhuraja. Vallabha's successor Durlabha is said to have repulsed an attack by a confederacy that included the ruler of Malwa, but modern historians doubt the authenticity of this legend.\n\nBhoja's first military aggression appears to be his invasion of the Lata region (in present-day Gujarat), around 1018 CE. Bhoja subjugated the Chalukyas of Lata, whose ruler Kirtiraja may have served as his feudatory for a brief period. Bhoja's invasion of Lata brought him close to the Shilahara kingdom of northern Konkana, which was located to the south of Lata. Bhoja invaded and captured Konkana sometime between 1018 and 1020 CE, during the reign of the Shilahara king Arikesari. He celebrated this victory in a big way by making generous donations to Brahmins. His 1020 CE inscription states that he organized a \"Konkana-Grahana Vijaya Parva\" (\"Konkan Victory Festival\"). The Shilaharas probably continued to administer Konkana as Bhoja's vassals. By the end of his reign, Bhoja had lost this territory to the Chalukyas of Kalyani.\n\nSometime before 1019 CE, Bhoja formed an alliance against the Chalukyas of Kalyani with Rajendra Chola and Gangeyadeva Kalachuri. At this time, Jayasimha II was the Chalukya king. The triple alliance engaged the Chalukyas at their northern and southern frontiers simultaneously. The extent of Bhoja's success in this campaign is not certain, as both Chalukya and Paramara panegyrics claimed victory. D. C. Ganguly believes that Bhoja achieved some early victories against the Chalukyas, but was ultimately defeated. Others, including D. B. Diskalkar and H. C. Ray, believe that Bhoja was defeated by Jayasimha after some early successes, but ultimately emerged victorious against the Chalukyas after 1028 CE. According to Georg Bühler, the struggle probably ended with some advantage for Bhoja, which might have been exaggerated into a great victory by the Paramara poets.\n\nThe \"Udaipur Prashasti\" states that Bhoja defeated a ruler named Indraratha. Modern historians identify this king with Indranatha, the Somavamshi king of Kalinga. This king was defeated by Rajendra Chola: Bhoja may have played a secondary role in the Chola campaign as part of an alliance.\n\nThe Ghaznavids, a Muslim dynasty of Turkic origin, invaded north-western India in the 11th century, led by Mahmud of Ghazni. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" claims that Bhoja's mercenaries defeated the Turushkas (Turkic people). There are some legendary accounts of Bhoja's military successes against the foreign invaders identified with the Ghaznavids. However, there is no clear evidence to show that Bhoja fought against the Ghaznavids or any other Muslim army. Bhoja might have contributed troops to the Kabul Shahi ruler Anandapala's fight against the Ghaznavids. He is believed to have granted asylum to Anandapala's son Trilochanapala. Several medieval Muslim historians state that Mahmud avoided a confrontation with a powerful Hindu ruler named Param Dev after sacking the Somnath Hindu temple. Modern historians identify Param Dev as Bhoja: the name may be a corruption of Paramara-Deva or of Bhoja's title \"Parameshvara-Paramabhattaraka\". Bhoja may have also been a part of the Hindu alliance that expelled Mahmud's governors from Hansi, Thanesar and other areas around 1043 CE.\n\nBhoja's attempt to expand his kingdom eastwards was foiled by the Chandela king Vidyadhara. However, Bhoja was able to extend his influence among the Chandela feudatories, possibly after Vidyadhara's death. The Kachchhapaghatas of Dubkund, who were the northern neighbours of the Paramaras, were originally Chandela feudatories. However, their ruler Abhimanyu accepted Bhoja's suzerainty. Bhoja also launched a campaign against the Kachchhapaghatas of Gwalior, possibly with the ultimate goal of capturing Kannauj, but his attacks were repulsed by their ruler Kirtiraja.\n\nAccording to the \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription, Bhoja defeated the Gurjara king. The identity of this king is debated by the historians, but he is generally identified as a weak Gurjara-Pratihara ruler of Kannauj. Bhoja did not retain control of Kannauj for a long time, if at all.\n\nThe 1046 CE Tilakawada copper plate inscription states that Bhoja's general Suraditya stabilized his royal fortune by slaughtering one Sahavahana in a battle. Some earlier historians identified Sahavahana as a king of Chamba, but this identification is doubtful, considering the distance between Chamba and Malwa, and the fact that the ruler of Chamba was not powerful enough to destabilize Bhoja's kingdom. Sahavahana might been a general of one of Bhoja's rivals, possibly the Kalachuri king Karna.\n\nBhoja defeated and killed Viryarama, the Shakambhari Chahamana ruler. Encouraged by this success, he also waged a war against the Chahamanas of Naddula. But in this second campaign, his army was forced to retreat, and his general Sadha was killed.\n\nDuring the last years of Bhoja's reign, sometime after 1042 CE, Jayasimha's son and successor Someshvara I invaded Malwa, and sacked his capital Dhara. Multiple Chalukya inscriptions dated between 1058 and 1067 CE state that the Chalukyas plundered the important Paramara cities, including Dhara, Ujjayini and Mandapa. Bhoja re-established his control over Malwa soon after the departure of the Chalukya army. Nevertheless, the defeat was a major setback for the Paramaras, and pushed back the southern boundary of their kingdom from Godavari to Narmada.\n\nAlthough the Bhoja and Kalachuri king Gangeya were part of an alliance against the Chalukyas, Bhoja defeated Gangeya. It is not certain when they turned into enemies. According to one theory, Bhoja defeated Gangeya before his Chalukya campaign, in which Gangeya must have fought as a Paramara vassal. A contradictory theory is that the two turned enemies after their Chalukya campaign, sometime between 1028 CE and 1042 CE. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" also claims that Bhoja defeated one Togglala, who might have been Gangeya's predecessor Kokalla II.\n\nDuring the last year of Bhoja's reign, or shortly after his death, the Chaulukya king Bhima I and the Kalachuri king Karna attacked his kingdom. According to the 14th century author Merutunga, Bhoja had once thought of subjugating Bhima, but Bhima's diplomat avoided a Paramara invasion by instigating Bhoja against the Chalukyas of Kalyani instead. Sometime before 1031 CE, Bhima launched an expedition against the Paramara branch at Abu, forcing its ruler Dhandhuka to seek shelter with Bhoja. Hemachandra, who was patronized by the Chaulukyas, states that Bhoja's general Kulachandra once sacked the Chaulukya capital while Bhima was fighting a war at the Sindh frontier. Bhima later dispatched his soldiers to raid Malwa several times. Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" states that once two such soldiers attacked Bhoja in the vicinity of his capital Dhara, but the Paramara king escaped unhurt.\n\nMerutunga also states that Karna once challenged Bhoja to either a war or a palace-building contest. Bhoja, who was an old man by this time, chose the second option. Bhoja lost this contest, but refused to accept Karna's suzerainty. As a result, Karna, in alliance with Bhima, invaded Malwa. According to Merutunga, Bhoja died of a disease at the same time the allied army attacked his kingdom. Several literary works written under Chaulukya patronage suggest that Bhima subjugated Bhoja while Bhoja was still alive. However, such claims are not corroborated by historical evidence.\n\nBhoja is best remembered for his intellect and patronage to cultural activities. Noted poets and writers of his time sought his sponsorship. The Kashmiri writer Bilhana famously rued that Bhoja died before him, because of which he failed to seek the king's patronage. Several later kings also emulated Bhoja. For example, Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire styled himself as \"Abhinava-Bhoja\" (\"the new Bhoja\") and \"Sakala-Kala-Bhoja\" (\"Bhoja of all the arts\").\n\nBhoja was himself a polymath. Under his rule, Mālwa and its capital Dhara became one of the chief intellectual centres of India. He is said to have paid great attention to the education of his people, so much so that even humble weavers in the kingdom are supposed to have composed metrical Sanskrit kavyas.\n\nBhoja is said to have founded the city of Bhojpur, a belief supported by historical evidence. Besides the Bhojeshwar Temple there, the construction of three now-breached dams in that area is attributed to him. The temple originally stood on the banks of a reservoir 18.5 long and 7.5 miles wide. This reservoir was formed through construction of 3 earth-and-stone dams during Bhoja's reign. The first dam, built on Betwa River, trapped the river waters in a depression surrounded by hills. A second dam was constructed in a gap between the hills, near present-day Mendua village. A third dam, located in present-day Bhopal, diverted more water from the smaller Kaliasot river into the Betwa dam reservoir. This man-made reservoir existed until 15th century, when Hoshang Shah emptied the lake by breaching two of the dams.\n\nBhoja established the Bhoj Shala which was a centre for Sanskrit studies and a temple of Sarasvatī in present-day Dhar. According to folklore, the Bhopal city was established by and named after him (\"Bhojpal\"), but it is possible that the city derives its name from another king called Bhupala (or Bhupal).\n\nBhoja was renowned as a scholar-king, and several books are attributed to him. Because these books cover an enormous range of topics, it is not certain if he actually wrote all these books or if he only commissioned these works, acting as a patron of their actual writers. But it is known that he was an expert on poetry, and the treatise \"Shringara-Prakasha\" was definitely authored by him.\n\nAccording to Ajada, who wrote a commentary titled \"Padaka-prakasha\" on \"Sarasvati-Kanthabharana\", Bhoja wrote 84 books. The surviving works attributed to Bhoja include the following Sanskrit-language texts (IAST titles in bracket):\n\nThe Prakrit language poems \"Kodanda-Kavya\" and \"Kurma-Sataka\" are also attributed to Bhoja. The \"Kodanda-Kavya\" (Kodaṅḍakāvya) was found inscribed on stone slab fragments at Mandu. The \"Kurma-Sataka\" (\"Avanikūrmaśataka\"), which praises the Kurma (tortoise) incarnation of Vishnu, was found inscribed at the Bhoj Shala in Dhar.\n\n\"Sangitaraja\", attributed to Kalasena or Kumbha, names Bhoja as an authority on music, which suggests that Bhoja also compiled or wrote a work on music.\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that Bhoja was a devotee of Shiva. His writings qualify Shiva as \"Jagadguru\" (\"World teacher\"), and his inscriptions begin with verses praising Shiva. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription of the later Paramara rulers states that Bhoja \"covered the earth with temples\" dedicated to the various aspects of Shiva, including Kedareshvara, Rameshwara, Somanatha, Kala, and Rudra. The Jain writer Merutunga, in his \"Prabandha-Chintamani\", states that Bhoja constructed 104 temples in his capital city of Dhara alone. However, the Bhojeshwar Temple in Bhojpur is the only surviving shrine that can be attributed to Bhoja with certainty. The Samidheshvara or Tribhuvana Narayana Shiva temple of Chittor is also believed to have been constructed by Bhoja; it has an idol, which was originally called Bhoja-svamin-deva.\n\nThe Jain legends state that Bhoja converted to Jainism. According to this account, his court poet Dhanapala convinced the king to give up Vedic animal sacrifices. The poet also openly ridiculed Bhoja's other religious beliefs, including his worship of Kamadeva-Rati and cow. Gradually, Dhanapala convinced Bhoja to become a Jain.\n\nThese accounts of Bhoja's conversion to Jainism are irreconcilable with historical evidence. In a \"Bhoja-Prabandlha\" legend, a Brahmin named Govinda calls Bhoja a Vaishnavite. It is possible that Bhoja patronized other faiths despite being a Shaivite.\n\nBhoja married multiple women as part of matrimonial alliances with other ruling dynasties. His chief queen was Liladevi or Lilavati. His other queens included Padmavati (princess of Kuntala), Chandramukhi (princess of Anga) and Kamala.\n\nInscriptional evidence suggests that he was succeeded by Jayasimha, who was probably his son. Jayasimha's Mandhata grant of 1055 CE mentions his predecessors as Bhoja, Sindhuraja and Vakpati. However, this inscription does not specify the relationship between Bhoja and Jayasimha, and it is the only epigraph that mentions a Paramara king named Jayasimha. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" and \"Nagpur Prashasti\" inscriptions of the later Paramara kings give a detailed genealogy of the Paramara kings, but do not mention Jayasimha. These two inscriptions name Udayaditya as the next ruler after Bhoja. Udayaditya is now known to be Bhoja's brother.\n\nIn terms of the number of legends centered around him, Bhoja is comparable to the fabled Vikramaditya. Sheldon Pollock describes Bhoja as \"the most celebrated poet-king and philosopher-king of his time, and perhaps of any Indian time\". Bhoja came to be featured in several legends as a righteous scholar-king, who was the ultimate judge of literary qualities and generously rewarded good poets and writers. Most of these legends were written three to five centuries after his death.\n\nApart from epigraphic records, much of the information about Bhoja comes from these legendary accounts, including Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" (14th century), Rajavallabha's \"Bhoja-Charitra\" (15th century), and Ballala's \"Bhoja-Prabandha\" (17th century). However, many of the popular legends about Bhoja do not have any historical basis. For example, the \"Bhoja-Prabandha\" anachronistically describes the ancient poet Kalidasa as a contemporary of Bhoja.\n\nIn order to enhance their imperial claims, the Paramaras promoted several legends associating Bhoja with the ancient legendary kings. For example, in \"Simhasana Dvatrimsika\" (popularly known as \"Singhasan Battisi\"), Bhoja finds a throne of Vikramaditya, and each of the 32 divine figurines attached to the throne tell him a story about Vikramaditya. A \"Bhavishya Purana\" legend describes Bhoja as a descendant of Vikramaditya and Shalivahana. According to this legend, the mleccha (foreign) influence had corrupted Indian culture by the time of Bhoja's ascension. Bhoja marched up to the banks of the Indus river, and defeated several mleccha kings. The poet Kalidasa, who accompanied him, magically turned into ashes a mleccha named Mahamada, whose followers came to be known as Muslim (The character Mahamada is based on Muhammad possibly combined with Mahmud of Ghazni). After returning to his capital, Bhoja established Sanskrit language among the top three varnas and Prakrit language among the Shudras. During his 50-year reign, Aryavarta (the land between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas) became a blessed land where the varna system was established. On the other hand, caste mixture took place beyond the Vindhyas (that is, in South India). Again, this is an imaginary account not supported by any historical evidence.\n\n"}

The preceding expression, whose meaning is determined or specified by the later expression, may be called a cataphor. Cataphora is a type of anaphora, although the terms \"anaphora\" and \"anaphor\" are sometimes used in a stricter sense, denoting only cases where the order of the expressions is the reverse of that found in cataphora.\n\nAn example of cataphora in English is the following sentence:\nIn this sentence, the pronoun \"he\" (the cataphor) appears earlier than the noun \"John\" (the postcedent) that it refers to. This is the reverse of the more normal pattern, \"strict\" anaphora, where a referring expression such as \"John\" or \"the soldier\" appears before any pronouns that reference it. Both cataphora and anaphora are types of endophora.\n\nOther examples of the same type of cataphora are:\n\nCataphora across sentences is often used for rhetorical effect. It can build suspense and provide a description. For example:\n\nThe examples of cataphora described so far are strict cataphora, because the anaphor is an actual pronoun. Strict within-sentence cataphora is highly restricted in the sorts of structures it can appear within, generally restricted to a preceding subordinate clause. More generally, however, any fairly general noun phrase can be considered an anaphor when it co-refers with a more specific noun phrase (i.e. both refer to the same entity), and if the more general noun phrase comes first, it can be considered an example of cataphora. Non-strict cataphora of this sort can occur in many contexts, for example:\n\nStrict cross-sentence cataphora where the antecedent is an entire sentence is fairly common cross-linguistically:\n\nCataphora of this sort is particularly common in formal contexts, using an anaphoric expression such as \"this\" or \"the following\":\n\n"}

Each grammar works on a string, a so-called \"sequential form\" that represents an environment. Grammar systems can thus be used as a formalization of decentralized or distributed systems of agents in artificial intelligence.\n\nLet formula_1 be a simple reactive agent moving on the table and trying not to fall down from the table with two reactions, \"t\" for turning and \"ƒ\" for moving forward. The set of possible behaviors of formula_1 can then be described as formal language\n\nwhere \"ƒ\" can be done maximally \"k\" times and \"t\" can be done maximally \"ℓ\" times considering the dimensions of the table.\n\nThe schema on the right describes such a system of grammars which shares a common string representing an environment. The shared sequential form is sequentially rewritten by each grammar, which can represent either a component or generally an agent.\n\nIf grammars communicate together and work on a shared sequential form, it is called a \"Cooperating Distributed (DC)\" grammar system. Shared sequential form is a similar concept to the blackboard approach in AI, which is inspired by an idea of experts solving some problem together while they share their proposals and ideas on a shared blackboard.\n\nEach grammar in a grammar system can also work on its own string and communicate with other grammars in a system by sending their sequential forms on request. Such a grammar system is then called a \"Parallel Communicating (PC)\" grammar system.\n\nPC and DC are inspired by distributed AI. If there is no communication between grammars, the system is close to the decentralized approaches in AI. These kinds of grammar systems are sometimes called \"colonies\" or \"Eco-Grammar\" systems, depending (besides others) on whether the environment is changing on its own (Eco-Grammar system) or not (colonies).\n\n"}
{"id": "1901849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901849", "title": "Informant", "text": "Informant\n\nAn informant (also called an informer) is a person who provides privileged information about a person or organization to an agency. The term is usually used within the law enforcement world, where they are officially known as confidential or criminal informants (CI), and can often refer pejoratively to the supply of information without the consent of the other parties with the intent of malicious, personal or financial gain. However, the term is used in politics, industry and academia.\n\nInformants are commonly found in the world of organized crime. By its very nature, organized crime involves many people who are aware of each other's guilt, in a variety of illegal activities. Quite frequently, confidential informants (or criminal informants) will provide information in order to obtain lenient treatment for themselves and provide information, over an extended period of time, in return for money or for police to overlook their own criminal activities. Quite often, someone will become an informant following their arrest.\n\nInformants are also extremely common in every-day police work, including homicide and narcotics investigations. Any citizen who provides crime related information to law enforcement by definition is an informant.\n\nThe CIA has been criticized for leniency towards drug lords and murderers acting as paid informants, informants being allowed to engage in some crimes so that the potential informant can blend into the criminal environment without suspicion, and wasting billions of dollars on dishonest sources of information.\n\nInformants are often regarded as traitors by their former criminal associates. Whatever the nature of a group, it is likely to feel strong hostility toward any known informers, regard them as threats and inflict punishments ranging from social ostracism through physical abuse and/or death. Informers are therefore generally protected, either by being segregated while in prison or, if they are not incarcerated, relocated under a new identity.\n\nInformants, and especially criminal informants, can be motivated by many reasons. Many informants are not themselves aware of all of their reasons for providing information, but nonetheless do so. Many informants provide information while under stress, duress, emotion and other life factors that can impact the accuracy or veracity of information provided.\n\nLaw enforcement officers, prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges and others should be aware of possible motivations so that they can properly approach, assess and verify informants' information.\n\nGenerally, informants' motivations can be broken down into self-interest, self-preservation and conscience.\n\nA list of possible motivations includes:\n\nSelf-Interest:\n\nSelf-Preservation:\n\nConscience:\n\nCorporations and the detective agencies that sometimes represent them have historically hired labor spies to monitor or control labor organizations and their activities. Such individuals may be professionals or recruits from the workforce. They may be willing accomplices, or may be tricked into informing on their co-workers' unionization efforts.\n\nPaid informants have often been used by authorities within politically and socially oriented movements to weaken, destabilize and ultimately break them.\n\nInformers alert authorities regarding government officials that are corrupt. Officials may be taking bribes, or participants in a money loop also called a kickback. Informers in some countries receive a percentage of all monies recovered by their government.\n\nLactantius described an example from ancient Rome involved the prosecution of a woman suspected to have advised a woman not to marry Maximinus II: \"Neither indeed was there any accuser, until a certain Jew, one charged with other offences, was induced, through hope of pardon, to give false evidence against the innocent. The equitable and vigilant magistrate conducted him out of the city under a guard, lest the populace should have stoned him... The Jew was ordered to the torture till he should speak as he had been instructed... The innocent were condemned to die... Nor was the promise of pardon made good to the feigned adulterer, for he was fixed to a gibbet, and then he disclosed the whole secret contrivance; and with his last breath he protested to all the beholders that the women died innocent.\"\n\nCriminal informant schemes have been used as cover for politically motivated intelligence offensives.\n\nJailhouse informants, who report hearsay (admissions against penal interest) which they claim to have heard while the accused is in pretrial detention, usually in exchange for sentence reductions or other inducements, have been the focus of particular controversy. Some examples of their use are in connection with Stanley Williams, Cameron Todd Willingham, Gerald Stano, Thomas Silverstein, Marshall \"Eddie\" Conway, and a suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz.\n\nSlang terms for informants include:\n\nThe phrase \"drop a dime\" refers to an informant using a payphone to call the authorities to report information.\n\nThe term \"stool pigeon\" originates from the long-ago practice of tying a passenger pigeon to a stool. The bird would flap its wings in a futile attempt to escape. The sound of the wings flapping would attract other pigeons to the stool where they could be easily killed or captured.\n\n\nA system of informants existed in Russian Empire and later adopted by the Soviet Union. In Russia such person was known as osvedomitel or donoschik (literally, \"whistleblower\") and secretly cooperated with law enforcement agencies such as Okhranka or later Soviet militsiya or KGB. Officially those informants were referred to as secret coworker (, sekretny sotrudnik) and often were referred by a Russian derived portmanteau seksot.\n\nIn some KGB documents has also been used a term \"source of operational information\" (, istochnik operativnoi informatsii).\n\n"}

He was the original founder of the Aglipayan Church, an independent Philippine national church. For his writings and activism with labor unions, he was called the \"Father of Filipino Socialism\".\n\nAs a young man, de los Reyes followed his mother's footsteps by initially turning to writing as a career; his works were part of the 1887 \"Exposicion General de las Islas Filipinas\" in Madrid. He later became a journalist, editor, and publisher in Manila, and was imprisoned in 1897 for revolutionary activities. He was deported to the Kingdom of Spain, where he was jailed for his activities until 1898. While living and working in Madrid, he was influenced by the writings of European socialists and Marxists.\n\nReturning to the Philippines in 1901, de los Reyes founded the first labor union in the country. He also was active in seeking independence from the United States. After serving in the Philippine Senate in the 1920s, he settled into private life and religious writing. de los Reyes wrote on diverse topics in history, folk-lore, language, politics, and religion. He had a total of 27 children with three successive wives; he survived all his wives and 12 of his children.\n\nIsabelo de los Reyes was born to Elías de los Reyes and Leona Florentino in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. His mother, of mixed Spanish and Filipino descent, is recognised as the first significant female poet of the Philippines for her works in both Spanish and Ilocano. de los Reyes may have been distantly related to Ventura de los Reyes, a creole merchant who was the first Philippine delegate to the Spanish Cortes through his father's side. He may also have been a \"distant cousin\" of Jose Rizal through a Chinese tax collector married to both Rizal's grandmother and de los Reyes' grand-aunt.\n\nDue to their troubled marriage, Elías entrusted his six-year-old son Isabelo to the care of Don Marcelino Crisólogo, a wealthy relative who was also a writer in the vernacular. The boy was enrolled in a grammar school attached to the local seminary run by Augustinians; their harsh discipline made him a lifelong critic of friars. de los Reyes was a free spirit and chafed against seminary life. Once, he led a student strike against the friars to protest the maltreatment of students.\n\nIn 1880 at age 16, de los Reyes went to Manila without his uncle's consent, where he finished the \"Bachiller en Artes\" at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. After that, he studied law and palaeography at the Royal and Pontifical University of Santo Tomas.\n\nWhile studying in the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, he supplemented his allowance by taking to journalism, setting type for \"La Oceana Española\" as well as writing for periodicals such as \"Diario de Manila\", \"El Comercio\", \"La Revista Popular\", and \"La Opinion\". In November 1882, his work, \"La expedicion de Li-Ma-Hong contra Filipinas\" was published in \"Diario de Manila\" and garnered him a prize.\n\nIn 1886, de los Reyes worked as Manila correspondent for \"El Eco de Panay\", a newspaper in Iloilo, but was replaced by Wenceslao Retana when his reports began to appear too liberal. His reputation as an independent-minded writer was such that in 1887, \"La Opinion\" hired him as a foil for their ultra-conservative staff writer, Camilo Millan.\n\nAs a teenager, de los Reyes had been intrigued by the growing interest in the \"new science\" of \"El saber popular\" (folklore). On March 25, 1884, Jose Felipe Del Pan wrote an article in \"La Oceania Filipina\" calling readers to contribute folklore articles, inspired by interest in the subject in the peninsula. De los Reyes was urged by del Pan to contribute and gave him books on the subject pique his interest. Two months later, de los Reyes submitted his articles concerning the folklore of Ilocos, Malabon, and Zambales. In 1887, at the age of 23, del Pan compiled de los Reyes' articles and submitted them to the \"Exposición General de las Islas Filipinas\" in Madrid, where he won a silver medal. These articles would eventually become one of his most important contributions to Philippine studies, \"El Folk-lore Filipino\". \"Folk-Lore\" was published in 1889 in two volumes.\n\nDe los Reyes' interest in folklore continued. He collected materials, wrote for periodicals, and issued an open letter calling on readers to collect, publish, and organize a folklore society, which did not materialize. De los Reyes wrote \"Folk-Lore\" not just as a book for legends and fables, but eventually as \"a general archive at the service of all sciences\", expanding his definition of \"folklore\" to include \"popular knowledge relevant to all sciences\", including sections on religion, customs, literature, and articles on Diego Silang, millenarian revolts, and local miracles of the Virgin Mary.\n\nIn 1884, de los Reyes was married to Josefa Hizon Sevilla, his first wife. Sevilla was the daughter of Gregorio Sevilla, the \"capitan\" of Malabon. Shortly after, the couple started a pawnshop, which failed. They also opened a bookstore, which similarly failed because de los Reyes \"refused to sell the good ones\". Eventually, they were able to build a modest fortune as a commercial agent of rice, tobacco, indigo, and other products.\n\nDuring this time, de los Reyes published in rapid succession multiple works: \"Ilocandias\" (1887), \"Articulos Varios\" (1887), \"Las Islas Visayas en la epoca de la conquista\" (1889), \"Historia de Filipinas\" (1889), and the two-volume \"Historia de Ilocos\" (1890). These and other works won him a measure of recognition as a scholar. By 1889, he was listed as a corresponding or honorary member of societies such as the \"Imperial y Real Sociedad Geografica de Vienna\", \"Academia Indo-China de Francia\", and the \"Sociedad Española de Geografica Comercial\".\n\nIn 1889 he founded \"El Ilocano\", said to be the first newspaper written solely in a Philippine vernacular. de los Reyes declared that he founded \"El Ilocano\" to \"serve [our] beloved \"pueblo\" Ilocos by contributing to the enlightenment of her children, defending her interests.\" \"El Iloco\" lasted for seven years. By 1893, de los Reyes was able to acquire his own printing press, which he set up in the basement of his house in Binondo and called \"Imprenta de Isabelo de los Reyes\". Proud of his provincial origins, he boasted that the press parts were fabricated by Vigan artisans and he hired Ilocanos as printshop personnel.\n\nAside from \"El Ilocano\", de los Reyes also published the periodicals \"La Lectura Popular\" (1890-1892), a Tagalog biweekly joint venture with Jose de Jesus, and \"El Minicipio Filipino\" (1894), a short-lived Spanish-Tagalog magazine devoted to colonial jurisprudence.\n\nAs the Philippine Revolution of 1896 began, multiple personalities suspected of being a part of it were arrested by the Spanish government. One of these people was de los Reyes, who at the time, openly advocated reforms, and if necessary, \"take up arms against the tyrants\". de los Reyes was arrested on February 12, 1897, and taken to Bilibid Prison.\n\nDe los Reyes was charged with membership in \"La Liga Filipina\", the political organization organized by Rizal, as well as being knowledgeable of the Katipunan, however, he denied all of this. de los Reyes, however, sold types to Emilio Jacinto for the Katipunan's printing press, and he later claimed that he made a financial contribution to the \"Liga\". de los Reyes also claimed that while he declined when Julio Nakpil asked him to join the \"Liga\", he offered to give Nakpil a thousand pesos to purchase revolvers from someone on board the steamer \"Salvadora\", and that he offered his services as a soldier.\n\nIn Bilibid, de los Reyes wrote his \"Memorial sobre la revolution\", which initially was the \"Memoria de agravios de los Filipinos\". The document was addressed to the Governor-General, Fernando Primo de Rivera and was meant to gain sympathy for the rebels. His \"Memoria\" pointed out that the friars sowed the seeds of colonial revolt in the Philippines. de los Reyes' wife, Josefa, died while he was in prison.\n\nde los Reyes was pardoned on May 17, the King's birthday, but was arrested again shortly after complaining about the injustice of his arrest and reminding the governor-general of the \"Memoria\" that he sent. de los Reyes was deported aboard the \"SS Alicante\" in June 1897, and was interred at the Montjuïc Castle in Barcelona for six months, before being released as part of the terms of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato.\n\nDuring his time in Montjuïc, de los Reyes was acquainted with anarchists, syndicalists, and other extremists, who shaped him. A sympathetic guard supplied him with anarchist books and newspapers. de los Reyes also met Ramon Sempau, a Spanish poet-journalist who left an impression in de los Reyes.\n\nAfter his release in 1898, de los Reyes was barred from leaving Spain and became a drifter in Barcelona. It was during this time that he came to know radicals such as Francisco Ferrer, Alejandro Lerroux, and others. He began reading the works of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, and other socialist thinkers. He also joined protest actions and was imprisoned for a short time by police authorities. He was released and was forced to relocate from Barcelona to Madrid.\n\nDuring his time in Madrid, he was taken in by Doña Justa Jugo Vidal and met with other Filipinos to discuss the Philippine situation. He also met Señorita Maria Angeles Lopez Montero and married her on Christmas Eve in 1898. He was also commissioned to translate the Bible to Iloko. de los Reyes later said that this work was \"one way by which [he] could contribute to the liberalization of dogmatic religion.\"\n\nAt the onset of the Spanish–American War, de los Reyes was employed as Counselor of the Ministry of the Colonies (\"Consejero del Ministerio de Ultramar\"), which he held until 1901. In this capacity, de los Reyes helped rally Filipino support against the Americans, thinking that this would create conditions favorable to the Philippines. He believed that once the Americans were repelled, they would be granted autonomy, and should Spain renege, then the already armed Filipinos could take matters to their own hands. He had received assurances from the governor-general Basilio Augustin regarding autonomy, and together with other Filipinos in Spain, offered to return to the Philippines to organize militias to fight the Americans.\n\nDe los Reyes wrote anti-American articles for \"La Correspondencia de Epaña\" and other papers. On November 10, 1898, as Spain's loss of the Philippines became imminent, he and Dominador Gomez published \"Filipinas ante Europa\"\n, which had the editorial logo: \"Contra Norte-America, no; contra el imperialismo, sí, hasta la muerte!\" (Against the Americans, no; against Imperialism, yes, till death!) It ran for 86 issues between October 25, 1899 and June 10, 1901. After closing, it briefly reappeared as \"El Defensor de Filipinas\", which ran monthly from July 1 to October 1, 1901.\n\nAfter Aguinaldo's surrender, de los Reyes was repatriated to Manila on July 1, 1901. Given guarantees by the American consul in Barcelona that he will in no way molested upon his arrival in the Philippines, he left Spain on September 14 aboard the steamer \"Montevideo\". De los Reyes arrived in Manila on October 15, 1901.\n\nOn his return, de los Reyes quickly set about to launching several initiatives that he already had in mind while still in Spain. On October 25, 1901, ten days after he returned to Manila, he south authority from the Philippine Commission to publish his \"Defensor de Filipinas\", which was refused. On October 31, he appeared before the Commission, with Pedro Paterno and Pascual H. Poblete to seek permission to form a political party, the \"Partido Nacionalista\", which was also denied. He wanted to push for a party that would push for independence within the framework of US occupation. Eventually, Poblete managed to form the Nacionalista Party, which de los Reyes joined. He was eventually named its leader.\n\nIn tandem with party building, de los Reyes also set about organizing a wokers' movement in the Philippines. In 1902, Hermenegildo Cruz and other members of the Carmelo and Bauermann publishing house approached de los Reyes to seek advice in forming a cooperative store for rice and other staples. The \"Union Democratica de Litografos, Impresores, Encuadernadores y Otros Obreros\" was thus formed on February 2, 1902, which came to be known as the \"Union Obrera Democratica\". De los Reyes was its first president.\n\nDe los Reyes took home with him works by socialists such as Karl Marx, Proudhon, Bakunin, and Errico Malatesta. Malatesta's \"Propaganda socialista fra contadini\" was particularly familiar to union organizers. The UOD was the first labor federation in the Philippines, soon being joined by neighborhood associations from Cavite, Quiapo, Santa Cruz and Sampaloc; company guilds from the San Miguel Brewery and L.R. Yangco Shipping Company; and trade associations of printers, \"tabaqueros\", tailors, sculptors, seamen, and cooks. At its peak in 1903, the UOD's membership was estimated at around twenty thousand.\n\nAs conceived by de los Reyes, the UOD's aim was to \"achieve the longed-for alliance between capital and labor\" by bringing together workers and employers in a spirit of friendship, mutual respect, and recognized interdependence. de los Reyes also wished to enlighten the masses as a prerequisite to modern nationhood. In this end, he organized \"veladas instructivo-recreativas\" as a way to \"improve themselves and learn the life of cultured peoples\". He had observed that workers in Europe had clubs and cafes where they could read newspapers and discuss current events, and wished to emulate that in the Philippines. de los Reyes also published the UOD's official organ, \"La Redencion del Obrero\".\n\nDe los Reyes spent this time mediating in labor disputes and other union-organizing activities. The press at this time called him a \"Malay Lerroux\" and compared him to Spanish labor leader Pablo Iglesias. On August 16, 1902, he was arrested on the trumped-up charge that he gave orders to assassinate scabs in a strike at the Commercial Tobacco Factory. De los Reyes was eventually released on January 30, 1903 by Governor William Howard Taft, stating that the statute \"was not in line with current American thinking on the subject\". While in prison, de los Reyes tendered his resignation from the UOD on September 14 and was replaced by Dominador Gomez.\n\nAfter resigning from the UOD, de los Reyes tried to patch up internal rivalries within the organization but ultimately failed. The UOD was dissolved and in its place was the \"Union del Trabajo de Filipinas\", headed by writer Lope K. Santos. After this, de los Reyes focused on his \"Redencion del Obrero\" while contributing to papers like \"El Comercio\", \"Grito del Pueblo\", and others. He took up causes such as labor rights, universal suffrage, the exclusion of Chinese immigrant labor, and parity of Filipinos and Americans in the civil service.\n\nDe los Reyes left the Philippines in February 1903 for a vacation, going to Japan and Hong Kong. He also sought to continue his translation of the bible and to oversee its printing in Yokohama, although others suggest that his true purpose was to meet with Artemio Ricarte, who was in exile at the time. Details are unclear whether de los Reyes met with Ricarte in Yokohama or in Hong Kong, although it was certain that a meeting took place between the two in Manila. De los Reyes relayed to him the Philippine situation and tried to dissuade him from resuming hostilities with the US.\n\nIn 1905, de los Reyes once again left for Spain where he stayed until 1909. During this time he worked as a juror in Barcelona until 1908. He also went back to mend relations with his wife, María Ángeles López Montero, who repeatedly urged him to stay away from politics. During his stay in Spain, he wrote texts such as \"Gregio Aglipay y otros prelados de la Iglesia Filipina Independiente\" (1906) and \"Biblia Filipina\". He also published \"La Religion Antigua de Filipinas\" (1909).\n\nDe los Reyes returned to Manila on April 3, 1909 with Lopez, however she could not adjust to the climate. After a few months, he brought her to Tokyo to recuperate. Lopez died on February 10, 1910 while giving birth to twin daughters.\n\nIn 1912 at the age of 48, de los Reyes was elected a councilor of the City of Manila, and began his political career. Winning re-election, he served as councilor until 1919. He ran as a candidate for the labor-based group called the \"Union Reformista\". As councilor, he worked on social welfare ordinances, pushed for \"Filipinization\" of the civil service, and filed resolutions urging immediate and absolute independence of the Philippines.\n\nDe los Reyes also met and married María Lim, a mestiza de sangley from Tondo. They married in the independent Aglipayan Church, which de los Reyes had helped found. She would eventually die in childbirth in 1923. As she was dying, she asked de los Reyes that they be married in the Catholic rite, to which he agreed.\n\nBeginning his campaign for the senate in 1922, in 1923, de los Reyes won a Senate seat in an election against Elpidio Quirino to represent the Ilocos region. As senator, he brokered projects, appointments, and other forms of patronage for his constituents. He was known for crying out \"Enough of this nonsense!\" whenever he was exasperated with debates on the Senate floor.\n\nDe los Reyes retired from politics after a stroke left him paralyzed and bedridden on June 5, 1929. He devoted his time to compiling Aglipayan texts and largely slipped out of public notice. His last foray into politics was when he ran in the 1935 elections, losing badly.\n\nDe los Reyes died on October 10, 1938 in a Manila hospital. A legal battle between his children regarding his custody ensued during the last years of his life. De los Reyes executed a document of retraction from his Aglipayan faith in 1936, although this was contested by other family members. His body was initially interred at the Manila North Cemetery before being transferred to the Iglesia Filipina Independiente National Cathedral in 1944.\n\nDe los Reyes was involved with the secular Filipino clergy as early as 1899, when he became a part of negotiations with the Holy See. On January 22, 1899, de los Reyes, representing the \"Committee of Paris\", visited the Papal Nuncio Giuseppe Francica-Nava de Bontifè in Madrid to convey the Aguinaldo government's desire for the Holy See to send a delegate to look into conditions in the Philippines. de los Reyes wrote in \"Filipinas Ante Europa\":\n\nEnough of Rome! Let us now form without vacillation our own congrations, a Filipino Church, conserving all that is good in the Roman Church and eliminating all the deceptions which the diabolical astuteness of the cunning Romanists had introduced to corrupt the moral purity and sacredness of the doctrines of Christ...\n\nOn his return to the Philippines in 1901, de los Reyes campaigned for the establishment of a Filipino Church. On August 3, 1902, with the help of Pascual H. Poblete and members of the UOD, the \"Iglesia Filipina Independiente\" was formed, with Gregorio Aglipay as its head. At the time, Aglipay was in talks with the Protestants and the Jesuits to prevent a schism, though neither of these events bore fruit. Aglipay initially dissociated himself from the schism, before realizing the futility of staying outside it. In September 1902, he accepted the position of \"Obispo Maximo\" and consecrated bishops for the new church.\n\nDe los Reyes traveled all over the country to rally people to the new church. He also directed the church publications \"Boletin de la Iglesia Filipina Independiente\" and \"La Iglesia Filipina Independente: Revista Catolica\". He also turned his residence into a temporary seminary. In 1929, de los Reyes was appointed an honorary bishop, a position he held until his death. In this capacity, he wrote multiple devotional and doctrinal texts such as the \"Biblia Filipina\", \"Oficio Divino\", \"Catequesis\", \"Plegarias\", \"Genesis Cientifico y Moderno\" and the \"Calendario Aglipayano\".\n\nIn 1884, at the age of 20, de los Reyes married Josefa Sevilla, the daughter of Gregorio Sevilla, the \"capitan\" of Malabon. He and his wife had ten children. His wife died of illness in 1897 while he was in Bilibid prison.\n\nIn late December 1898, he married María Ángeles López Montero (the daughter of a retired Spanish infantry colonel) in Madrid, also in a Catholic ceremony. She died in 1910 while giving birth to their ninth child.\n\nDe los Reyes' last marriage in 1912 was to the 18-year-old María Lim, a \"mestiza de sangley\" from Tondo. They married in the independent Aglipayan Church, which de los Reyes had helped found. They also had several children before María also died in childbirth in 1923. Before her death, she had asked that they be married according to the Catholic rite, to which de los Reyes agreed.\n\nWith his own family spanning Catholic and Aglipayan traditions, de los Reyes was tolerant of religious diversity among his children. Isabelo de los Reyes Jr., a son from his second marriage, was ordained an Aglipayan priest and later became \"Obispo Máximo IV\" of the church. His daughters Ángeles, Elisa, and Elvira from his second marriage, along with Crescencia from his third marriage, became professed nuns in the Catholic Church.\n\nDe los Reyes married thrice, siring a total of 27 children. He survived all his wives and twelve of his children.\n\nThroughout his life, Isabelo de los Reyes wrote and published multiple works in various subjects, such as history, folklore, politics, and religion. He used Spanish, Tagalog, and Ilokano in his writings. De los Reyes also published multiple newspapers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also translated into \"Iloko\" the Gospels of the New Testament and the Acts of the Apostles.\n\n"}

His father Ghelabhai was organiser of Deshi Natak Samaj, a play group. So he had his primary and secondary education at various places. He completed his matriculation in 1925 and joined Gujarat College for further studies. He left studies in 1930 when he was in final year of Bachelor of Arts as he participated in Indian independence movement.\n\nHe started publishing house in 1939 and published until his death. He was involved in Mahagujarat Movement in 1956 and he published \"Navgujarat\" daily during that period. He was elected to Bombay state assembly in 1957.

{"id": "1470997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1470997", "title": "Joan Fuster", "text": "Joan Fuster\n\nJoan Fuster i Ortells (; 23 November 1922 – 21 June 1992) was a Spanish writer. He is considered a major writer in Catalan language, and his work contributed to reinvigorate left-wing, pro-Catalan nationalism in Valencia during the Spanish transition to democracy. In his influential political essay Nosaltres, els valencians (1962) he coined the term Països Catalans (Catalan Countries) to refer to the Catalan-speaking territories, for which he claimed independent statehood from Spain.\n\nHe was born in the village of Sueca near Valencia, Spain, in a relatively prosperous middle-class family. Both his parents were pious Roman Catholics and Carlists. His father was a renowned local sculptor of mostly religious sculptures. In 1941 he became a member of the fascist organization Falange; however, he later abjured this affiliation. In 1947 Fuster graduated with a degree in law and he received a doctoral degree in Catalan philology in 1985. From 1946 to 1956 he co-directed the magazine \"Verb\" with José Albi. Of his first books, all of which are poetry, \"Escrit per al silenci\" (\"Written for the Silence\") (1954) stands out. In 1952 he began his collaborations with the press of \"Valencia\" in \"Levante\": this would be one of his more prominent facets. He would continue with it in \"Destino\" and in \"La Vanguardia\".\n\nWith \"El descrèdit de la Realitat\" (\"The Discredit of Reality\") (1955) he started a notable career as an essayist of vast thematic breadth and whose incisive style was noted for its precise use of adjectives. Another aspect of his work was his erudition and concern with the craft of storytelling and he worked greatly to maintain a literary reviewal he pushed forward in anthologies. His dedication to Valencian themes culminated in 1962 with the publication of what remained as his most known work: \"Nosaltres els valencians\" (\"We, the Valencians\"). This book, together with \"Qüestió de Noms\" (\"Matter of Names\") and \"El País Valenciano\" (\"The Valencian Country\"), are basic books on the history, culture and national identity problem of the Valencian Community from a Catalanist point of view.\n\nHe went on with this subject matter with the release of \"Raimon\" (1964), \"Combustible per a falles\" (\"Combustible for Falles\") (1967) and \"Ara o Mai\" (\"Now or Never\") (1981), among others. These, parts of his numerous studies and erudite historical and biographical articles, have been collected in the I and III tomes of the \"Obres completes\" (\"Complete Works\"). The \"Diari\" (\"Day-to-Day Works\") (1952–1960) occupy the second volume.\n\nWithin the realm of essay writing, he published \"Figures del temps\" (\"Figures of Times\"), Yxart award (1957), \"Judicis Finals\" (\"Final Judgments\") (1960), \"Diccionari per a ociosos\" (\"Dictionary for Idlers\") (1964), \"Causar-se d'esperar\" (\"Causing Oneself to Wait\") (1965), \"L'home, mesura de totes les coses\" (\"The Man, Measure of All Things\") (1967), and others—always within the tradition moral root of classical humanism, close in spirit to the moralists and French reformers (from Montaigne to the encyclopedists), as a critic and skeptic noted for his acid humor. Within his works on history, criticism and literary production, he published \"La Poesia Catalana\" (\"Catalan Poetry\") (1956), \"Poetes, Moriscos i Capellans\" (\"Poets, Moorish and Cures\") (1962), \"Heretgies, Revoltes i Sermons\" (\"Heresies, Revolts and Sermons\") (1968) and \"Literatura Catalana Contemporània\" (\"Contemporary Catalan Literature\") (1972), in addition to three extensive prologues for the works of Joan Salvat-Papasseit (1962), Salvador Espriu (1963) and Josep Pla (1966), joined together in \"Contra el Noucentisme\" (\"Against Noucentisme\") (1978).\n\nIn 1987 he collected his poetry into \"Set llibres de versos\" (\"Seven Books of Verses\"). The studies joined together in \"Llibres i problemes del Renaixentisme\" (\"Books and problems of the Renaissance\") (1989) are the fruit of the research carried out in his last few years. In 1994 the works \"Fuster Inèdit\" (\"Unpublished Fuster\") and \"Fuster Sabàtic\" (\"Sabbatical Fuster\") were edited.\n\nDespite having written also a number of fiction pieces, he is best known for his essays, especially the political ones. His most influential work by far was the book \"Nosaltres els valencians\" (\"We, the Valencians\") (1962), whereas other titles such as \"Qüestió de Noms\" (\"Matter of Names\") and \"Diccionari per a Ociosos\" (\"Dictionary for Idlers\") (1963) are well known in the Catalan nationalism. He became the intellectual leader of Valencian nationalism by the end of the 20th century, and was central in proposing the \"Països Catalans\" concept, which advocated for unity within Catalan culture as proposed by Catalan nationalists. In these books Fuster asserted that it was necessary to strengthen Valencia's relationships with the other Catalan speaking territories for there to be any chance of defending the autonomous culture of Valencia. In this way he sought to bring a Catalan-based cultural community into existence.\n\nIn this sense, Fuster is, for some, the most remarkable political essayist in Catalan of the generations that appeared after the Spanish Civil War.\n\nHe received the \"Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes\" (\"Catalan Letters Award\") (1975) and also, in the year 1983, the \"Medalla d’Or de la Generalitat de Catalunya\" (\"Gold Medal of Catalonia's Generality\"). In 1984 he was named doctor honoris causa by the University of Barcelona and by the Autonomous University of Barcelona. In 1986 he was appointed as professor of literature in the University of Valencia.\n\nOn September 11, 1981, two bombs exploded in his house, damaging heavily his library and archive. Nobody was prosecuted, but it is widely believed that it was the anti-Catalan far right's response to Fuster's political and cultural position.\n\n\n"}

Four regional (sub)dialects are distinguished: Epukiro, Tsumkwe, Rundu, and Omatako, with Tsumkwe being the best described; ǂKxʼauǁʼein may be another.\n\n\nJuǀʼhoan has four tones and five vowel qualities, which may be nasalized, glottalized, murmured, or combinations of these, and most of these possibilities occur both long and short. The qualities and may also be pharyngealized and strident (epiglottalized). Thus, there are a good 30 vowel phonemes, perhaps more, depending on one's analysis. There are, in addition, many vowel sequences and diphthongs.\n\nJuǀʼhoan has an unusually large number of consonants, even for a !Kung language. The following occur at the beginnings of roots. For brevity, only the alveolar clicks are listed with the other consonants; the complete set of clicks is found below.\n\nTenuis and modally voiced consonants (blue) may occur with any vowel quality. However, other consonants (grey, transcribed with a superscript diacritic to their right) do not occur in the same root as murmured, glottalized, or epiglottalized vowels.\n\nThe voiced aspirated and ejective consonants, both pulmonic and clicks, contain a voiceless interval, which Miller (2003) attributes to a larger glottal opening than is found in Hindustani breathy-voiced consonants. Phonetically, however, they are voice contours, starting out voiced but becoming voiceless for the aspiration or ejection.\n\nThe phonemic status of and is uncertain. may be epenthetic before vowel-initial words; alternatively, it may be that no word may begin with a vowel. occurs only in a single morpheme, the plural diminutive enclitic . and (not shown) only occur in loan words, and some accounts posit a and . Labials () are very rare initially, though common between vowels. Velar stops (oral and nasal) are rare initially and very rare medially.\n\nThe consonants listed as epiglottalized, following Miller-Ockhuizen (2003), have uvular frication and glottalization; they are similar to consonants in Nǀu described as uvular ejective by Miller et al. (2009).\n\nOnly a small set of consonants occur between vowels within roots. These are:\n\nMedial (green) are very common; are rare, and the other medial consonants occur in only a very few roots, many of them loans. are generally analyzed as allophones of . However, especially may correspond to multiple root-initial consonants.\n\nJuǀʼhoan has 48 click consonants. There are four click \"types\": dental, lateral, alveolar, and palatal, each of which found in twelve series or \"accompaniments\" (combinations of manner, phonation, and contour). These are perfectly normal consonants in Juǀʼhoan, and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position.\nAs above, tenuis and modally voiced consonants (blue) may occur with any vowel quality. However, other consonants (grey, transcribed with a superscript diacritic to their right) do not occur in the same root as murmured, glottalized, or epiglottalized vowels.\n\nGlottalized clicks occur almost exclusively before nasal vowels. This may indicate that these clicks are nasalized , etc., as is the case in most if not all other languages with glottalized clicks. The nasalization would not be audible during the click itself due to the glottalization, which would prevent any nasal airflow, but the velum would be lowered, potentially nasalizing adjacent vowels.\n\nThe 'uvularized' clicks are actually linguo-pulmonic contours, and , etc. The 'epiglottalized' clicks are heterorganic affricates, and equivalent to linguo-glottalic consonants transcribed and , etc., in other languages (Miller 2011).\n\nSee Ekoka !Kung for a related variety with a somewhat larger click inventory.\n\nIn the 1960s the South African Department of Education set about establishing official orthographies for the languages of Southwest Africa (Namibia). Jan Snyman was selected to develop an orthography for the then-unwritten Juǀʼhoasi, which was accepted in 1969. In this orthography, the name of the language is spelled Žuǀʼhõasi. A slightly modified form (Snyman 1975) is shown below.\n\nIn the 1980s the Bible Society of South Africa requested a new orthography, one that used only letters of the Latin alphabet, avoided diacritics as much as possible, and conformed as much as possible to the conventions of Afrikaans. This second orthography was accepted in 1987, in which the language is spelled Zjuc'hôa.\n\nA third orthography was developed by the Ju|wa Bushman Development Foundation in 1994. The three are compared with the IPA below. Tone is evidently unmarked:\n\nThe 1994 orthography also has \"ih, eh, ah, oh, uh\" for breathy (murmured) vowels, and \"ihn, ahn, ohn, uhn\" for breathy nasal vowels. However, Snyman maintains that these are positional variants of low-tone vowels, and not needed in an orthography (at least, not if tone were marked).\n\nOne of the clicks (*) is not attested.\n\nSource: Dickens (2009).\n\nJuǀ'hoan is basically isolating, being a zero-marking language in both clauses and noun phrases. The Word order is SOV. \n\nNouns are grouped into noun classes based on animacy and species, with each class having a pronoun-set. The plural is formed by the suffixing of -si or -sín or by no change, -Ø. Many nouns have irregular plurals, such as \"jù\" (\"person\", plural \"jú\").\n\nFor example, the noun \"gǂhòà\", \"dog\", belongs to class 2, and may be referred to with the pronoun \"ha\", whereas \"gǀúí\", \"forest\", belongs to class 5, which has \"ká\" as its corresponding pronoun. \n\nThe noun classes and their pronoun-sets are as follows:\n\nPersonal and demonstrative pronouns are:\n\n\nFollowing are some sample texts in the Juǀ'hoan language. \n\n\n\n"}

In its broader sense, it was used for combining Hebrew and Talmudic-Aramaic within the Rabbinic Hebrew, which served the purpose of writing the Jewish classical texts of the Middle Ages and the Early modern period.\n\nThe exact meaning of the phrase \"\"Lashon Hakodesh\" becomes clear due to its contrary term. In the Mishnah and the Gemara the term was aimed to take out the foreign languages that were commonly spoken among the Jewish communities:\n\nThe Rishonim sages perceived only Biblical Hebrew, and not the Mishnaic Hebrew, as \"Lashon Hakodesh\". In Yiddish, the term \"Loshn Koydesh\"\" serves to describe its own Hebrew-Aramaic component, as opposed to words originating from German or Slavic languages. In some Jewish Haredi denominations, the term is meant to describe old Hebrew as opposed to Modern Israeli Hebrew, and few extreme Haredi denominations even try to avoid using renewed words since the Revival of the Hebrew language.\n\nJewish philosophers have offered various reasonings for Hebrew being the \"Sacred Language\".\n\nMaimonides, in his book \"The Guide for the Perplexed\" (written in a Judeo-Arabic language), reasoned that the preference of the Hebrew language is based upon its internal characteristics:\n\nNahmanides disagrees with Maimonides' reasoning, and provides his own reasoning, based on the way the Hebrew was being used:\n\n\n"}

All methods are taught to control stammering with the aim being controlled speech and not fluency. There is no cure for stammering and the McGuire Programme does not claim to be a cure, instead offering a viable therapy option. However many stammerers that have had poor results with conventional speech therapy through childhood and adulthood, report significantly more success. As with all approaches there will be a distribution of outcomes. The McGuire Programme genuinely attempts to measure success rates across regions, and results in the range 65-85% are typical according to their criteria. Stammering is however notoriously difficult to measure, especially where the majority are covert, and tricks and avoidance play a major role.\n\nThe McGuire Programme was founded in 1994 by Dave McGuire, himself a person who stammers. He brought different therapy options together, namely non avoidance and diaphragmatic breathing, and combined them with his background in sports psychology. The courses follow a rigorous 3 or 4 day residential set up and all people on the course are people who stammer-this is a unique and key aspect of the course as we believe that advice is a form of nostalgia. The McGuire Programme has a substantial after support network with experienced graduates available in many regions of the world to help support new graduates of the programme and indeed established graduates.\n\nThe programme's best known graduate to-date is the British singer Gareth Gates who has regularly promoted the course during TV interviews in the UK and Ireland.

Although it shares high lexical similarity (60%) with Swahili, it is not intelligible with it. It is spoken by around 120,000 people (including 20,000 who use it as their second language). Speakers of \"Kimwani\" also use Portuguese, (the official language of Mozambique), Swahili and Makhuwa language. \"Kiwibo\", the dialect of the Island of Ibo is the prestige dialect. \"Kimwani\" (sometimes spelled as \"Quimuane\") is also called \"Mwani\" (sometimes spelled as: \"Mwane, Muane\") and \"Ibo\". According to Anthony P. Grant: 'Kimwani of northern Mozambique appears to be the result of imperfect shift towards Swahili several centuries ago by speakers of Makonde', and Arends et al. suggest it might turn out to be a Makonde–Swahili mixed language.\n\nThe Name \"Kimwani\" comes from the word \"Mwani\", meaning \"beach\". The prefix \"Ki\" means the language of, so \"Kimwani\" literally means \"language of the beach\".\n\n\"Kimwani\" (similar to Swahili) is unusual among sub-Saharan languages in having lost the feature of lexical tone (with the exception of some verbal paradigms where its use is optional). It does not have the penultimate stress typical of Swahili; it has movable pitch accent. Labialization of consonants (indicated by a [w] following the consonant) and palatalization of r (ry; [rj]) are frequent. Nasalization of vowels occurs only before a nasal consonant n followed by a consonant.\n\n\"Kimwani\" has five vowel phonemes: , , , , and , that is: its vowels are close to those of Spanish and Latin. It does not have a distinction of closed and open mid vowels typical of Portuguese, French or Italian.\n\nThe pronunciation of the phoneme /i/ stands between International Phonetic Alphabet [i] and [e]. Vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress. The vowels are pronounced as follows:\n\n\nKimwani has no diphthongs; in vowel combinations, each vowel is pronounced separately.\n\nTwo symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and voiced consonant, respectively.\n\n\"Kimwani\" can be spelled in three ways: using orthography similar to Swahili, using a slightly modified spelling system used in Mozambique schools or using a Portuguese-based spelling.

{"id": "1430549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1430549", "title": "Olga Constantinovna of Russia", "text": "Olga Constantinovna of Russia\n\nOlga Constantinovna of Russia (18 June 1926) was Queen consort of the Hellenes as the wife of King George I. She was briefly the regent of Greece in 1920. \n\nA member of the Romanov dynasty, she was the daughter of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. She spent her childhood in Saint Petersburg, Poland and the Crimea, and married King George I of Greece in 1867 at the age of sixteen. At first, she felt ill at ease in the Kingdom of Greece, but she quickly became involved in social and charitable work. She founded hospitals and schools, but her attempt to promote a new, more accessible, Greek translation of the Gospels sparked riots by religious conservatives.\n\nOn the assassination of her husband in 1913, Olga returned to Russia. When the First World War broke out, she set up a military hospital in Pavlovsk Palace, which belonged to her brother. She was trapped in the palace after the Russian Revolution of 1917, until the Danish embassy intervened, allowing her to escape to Switzerland. Olga could not return to Greece as her son, King Constantine I, had been deposed.\n\nIn October 1920, she returned to Athens on the fatal illness of her grandson, King Alexander. After his death, she was appointed regent until the restoration of Constantine I the following month. After the defeat of the Greeks in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22 the Greek royal family were again exiled and Olga spent the last years of her life in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.\n\nOlga was born at Pavlovsk Palace near Saint Petersburg on . She was the second child and elder daughter of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich and his wife, Grand Duchess Alexandra, a former princess of Saxe-Altenburg. Through her father, Olga was a granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I, a niece of Tsar Alexander II and first cousin of Tsar Alexander III.\n\nHer childhood was spent at her father's homes, including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the Crimea. Her father was a younger brother of Alexander II, and her mother was considered one of the most intelligent and elegant women of the court. Olga was particularly close to her older brother, Nicholas, and was one of the few members of the imperial family to keep in touch with him after he was banished to Tashkent.\n\nAs a child, Olga was described as a simple and chubby little girl with a broad face and big blue eyes. Unlike her younger sister, Vera, she had a calm temperament, but she was also extremely shy. For example, when interrogated by her tutors during lessons, she burst into tears and ran from the classroom.\n\nIn 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was appointed viceroy of Russian Poland by his brother and moved to Warsaw with his wife and children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who was the victim of a nationalist assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.\n\nThe young King George I of Greece visited Russia in 1863 to thank Olga's uncle Tsar Alexander II for his support during George's election to the throne of Greece. Whilst there, George met the then twelve-year-old Olga for the first time.\n\nGeorge visited Russia again in 1867 to meet with his sister Dagmar, who had married Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander III) the year before. He was determined to find a wife and the idea of an alliance with a Russian grand duchess, born into the Eastern Orthodox Church, appealed to him. Olga fell in love with George, but she was nevertheless anxious and distraught at the thought of leaving Russia. Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage, thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and, being close to his daughter, concerned by the distance between Greece and Russia. For her part, Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic than her husband and, when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter, she replied that Olga would not always be as young. Eventually, it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday. Meanwhile, she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day.\n\nOlga and George married at the chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg on . After five days of festivities, they spent a brief honeymoon at Ropsha, south-west of Saint Petersburg. Over the following twenty years, they had eight children:\n\nThe Tsar told Olga \"to love her new country twice more than her own\", but she was ill-prepared for her new life. Aware of her youth, she chose to retain the services of her governess to continue her education. On arrival at Piraeus, Olga wore blue and white, the national colors of Greece, to the delight of the crowd. On the way to the capital, popular unrest was such that Olga, who was not accustomed to such demonstrations, was close to tears. Unable to speak Greek, and with little time for rest, she attended official functions over several days. Overwhelmed, Olga was found sobbing under a staircase cuddling her teddy bear a few days after her arrival in the kingdom while she was expected for a formal event. In less than a year, she learnt Greek and English. On the advice of her mother, she took an interest in the archeology and history of Greece to gain public support.\n\nThroughout their marriage, George I and Olga were a close-knit couple, and contrary to the prevailing custom spent much time with their children, who grew up in a warm family atmosphere. With age, however, George I argued with his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically. In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.\n\nThe life of the royal family was relatively quiet and withdrawn. The Athenian court was not as brilliant and sumptuous as that of Saint Petersburg, and days in the Greek capital were sometimes monotonous for members of the royal family. In spring and winter, they divided time between the Royal Palace in Athens, and Tatoi Palace at the foot of Mount Parnitha. Summers were spent on vacation at Aix-les-Bains in France, visiting relatives in the Russian capital or at Fredensborg and Bernstorff in Denmark, and relaxing at Mon Repos, Corfu.\n\nOlga remained nostalgic for Russia. Her room was filled with icons from her homeland and, in the palace chapel, she sang Slavic hymns with her children. She often visited Russian ships that were docked at Piraeus and invited the Russian sailors to the royal palace. She was the only woman in history to bear the title of Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy, an honor given to her on marriage. She was honored in the Greek navy by having a ship named after her.\n\nOlga was genuinely popular and was extensively involved in charity work. On arrival in Athens, her immediate patronages included the Amalieion orphanage founded by the previous queen consort Amalia of Oldenburg, and the Arsakeion school for girls located on University Boulevard. With her personal support and the support of wealthy donors, she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled, and a sanatorium for patients with consumption. She founded a society to help the poor, a kindergarten for the children of the poor, and a soup kitchen in Piraeus that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and elderly women in financial difficulty. She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the \"Evangelismos\" (Annunciation) Hospital, Greece's largest, in downtown Athens. She built the Russian Hospital in Piraeus in memory of her daughter, Alexandra, who died in Moscow in 1891. Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors, the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece, with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty lepta and medicines being free. Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece and its neighbors, including the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the First Balkan War (1912–13). For their work for the wounded, Olga and her daughter-in-law Crown Princess Sophia were awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in December 1897.\n\nBefore Olga's arrival in Greece, there were no separate prisons for women or the young, and she was instrumental in the establishment of a women's prison in the capital and, with the support of wealthy philanthropist George Averoff, one for juvenile delinquents.\n\nShortly after Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, shots were fired at Olga's husband and daughter by disgruntled Greeks in 1898. Despite the failed assassination, Olga insisted on continuing her engagements without a military guard. Her son Nicolas wrote in his memoirs that one day he spoke of the importance of public opinion to his mother, and she retorted, \"I prefer to be governed by a well born lion rather than four hundred rats like me.\" Olga's interest in political and public opinion was limited. Although she favored Greece's Russian party, she had no political influence over her husband and did not seek political influence in the Greek parliament.\n\nAn Orthodox Christian from birth, Queen Olga became aware, during visits to wounded servicemen in the Greco-Turkish War (1897), that many were unable to read the Bible. The version used by the Church of Greece included the Septuagint version of the Old Testament and the original Greek-language version of the New Testament. Both were written in Koine Greek while her contemporaries used either Katharevousa or the so-called Demotic version of Modern Greek. Katharevousa was a formal language that contained archaized forms of modern words, was purged of \"non-Greek\" vocabulary from other European languages and Turkish, and had a (simplified) archaic grammar. Modern or Demotic Greek was the version commonly spoken. Olga decided to have the Bible translated into a version that could be understood by most contemporary Greeks rather than only those educated in Koine Greek. Opponents of the translation, however, considered it \"tantamount to a renunciation of Greece's 'sacred heritage'\".\n\nIn February 1901, the translation of the New Testament from Koine into Modern Greek that she had sponsored was published without the authorization of the Greek Holy Synod. The price was set at one drachma, far below its actual cost, and the edition sold well. To mitigate opposition to the translation, both the old and new texts were included and the frontispiece specifically stated it was for \"exclusive family use\" rather than in church.\n\nAt the same time, another translation was completed by Alexandros Pallis, a major supporter of a literary movement supporting the use of Demotic in written language. Publication of the translation started in serial form in the newspaper \"Akropolis\" on 9 September 1901. Purist theologians denounced this version as \"a ridiculing of the nation's most valuable relics\" and Ecumenical Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople denounced the translation. A faction of the Greek press started accusing Pallis and his Demoticist supporters of blasphemy and treason. Riots, peaking on 8 November, were started by students of the University of Athens, partly motivated by conservative professors. They demanded the excommunication of Pallis and anyone involved with the translations, including Olga and Procopios, the Metropolitan bishop of Athens, who had supervised the translation at her personal request.\n\nTroops were called in to maintain order, and conflict between them and the rioters resulted in eight deaths and over sixty people wounded. By December, the remaining copies of Olga's translation had been confiscated and their circulation prohibited. Anyone selling or reading the translations was threatened with excommunication. The controversy was called \"Evangelika\", i.e. \"the Gospels question\", after the word \"Evangelion\", Greek for \"Gospel\", and led to the resignation of the metropolitan bishop, Procopius, and the fall of the government of Georgios Theotokis.\n\nIn 1913, the First Balkan War ended with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire by a coalition of Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian and Montenegrin forces. Greece was considerably enlarged at the expense of Turkey, but divisions between the victorious powers in the Balkan League soon became apparent: Athens and Sofia vied for possession of Thessaloniki and its region. To affirm Greek control of the main city of Macedonia, George I moved to the city soon after its liberation. Just as he did in Athens, he went about Thessaloniki without any meaningful protection force, and while out for an afternoon walk near the White Tower on 18 March 1913, he was shot and killed by Alexandros Schinas. Olga, who said her husband's death was \"the will of God\", arrived at Thessaloniki the next day. She and her family visited the scene of the assassination and accompanied the body of the king to Athens. He was buried in the royal cemetery at Tatoi Palace.\n\nGeorge and Olga's eldest son, Constantine, became king and his wife, Sophia of Prussia, became the new queen consort. Olga, as queen dowager, was given the use of a wing in the royal palace but soon returned to her native Russia, to spend time with her younger brother, Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich and his family at his home, and Olga's birthplace, Pavlovsk Palace.\n\nIn August 1914, Olga was in Russia at the outbreak of World War I, in which the Allied or Entente Powers including Russia, Britain and France fought against the Central Powers including Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. She decided to stay in Saint Petersburg and establish a military hospital to support the Russian war effort. Olga created a clinic at Pavlovsk Palace where she cared for wounded soldiers with her sister-in-law, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna. Other members of the imperial family, such as Princess Helen and Olga's granddaughter Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna founded field hospitals at the front. As the war continued, Olga became aware of the growing crisis in Russia, and attempted to warn Tsarina Alexandra in 1916 of the danger of revolution but the Russian empress refused to listen. A few weeks later, Olga attracted the fury of the Tsarina after signing a petition asking for a pardon for her grandson, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, who had been exiled to the Persian front for his involvement in the assassination of Alexandra's favorite mystic, Grigori Rasputin.\n\nIn contrast to Olga, her eldest son, King Constantine I of Greece, was determined to follow a policy of neutrality. His maternal relations were Russian, and his wife was the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. His policy brought him into conflict with Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who favored the Allies. Constantine was soon accused of being a Germanophile and the Athenian government was regarded with suspicion in London and Paris. In what became known as the National Schism, Venizelos established a parallel government in Thessaloniki in opposition to Constantine.\n\nOn the collapse of the Tsarist regime in February 1917, Olga's sister-in-law left Pavlovsk with her family, but Olga stayed, soon to be almost alone except for a single young domestic named Anna Egorova. (After the Revolution, Egorova entered the service of Prince Christopher of Greece and became the governess of his son, Michael.) Short of food, the two women were limited to eating a little dry bread soaked in poor quality oil. Their safety was far from assured, and a few days after the October Revolution, Bolsheviks invaded and ransacked the palace. Olga was physically unharmed. She accepted the need to leave Russia, but the Bolsheviks refused to let her go and diplomatic help from Greece was not forthcoming in the aftermath of the National Schism. In June, Constantine had been deposed and exiled to Switzerland. As the Allies did not wish to establish a Greek republic or see Crown Prince George succeed his father, Constantine was replaced on the throne by his second son, Alexander, who was thought to be more favorable to the Allies and more malleable than his older brother. Venizelos held power and the supporters of the deposed king were arrested or executed.\n\nAfter several months of appeals for help, the Danish legation in Russia issued Olga a passport, which she used to enter Germany on the eve of its defeat, eventually joining her eldest son and his family in Switzerland in early 1919. Other members of the Russian imperial family did not escape. Among those killed were the Tsar, Tsarina and their five children; Olga's brothers Grand Dukes Nicholas and Dmitri Constantinovich; three of her nephews Princes John, Constantine and Igor Constantinovich; and the Tsarina's sister Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna.\nIn Switzerland, Constantine I and his family found themselves isolated and without an income. The Greek government under Venizelos did not pay pensions to former rulers and prohibited any contact between the exiles and King Alexander. Already in fragile health, the former king became gradually more depressed. The Russian Revolution and the National Schism deprived Olga of her immovable property and she was forced to live a much less lavish lifestyle than in the past. She did, however, enjoy spending more time with her sons and grandchildren, from whom she had been long separated by the war.\n\nOn 2 October 1920, King Alexander was bitten by a monkey during a walk through the gardens at Tatoi. The wound became infected and Alexander developed septicemia. On 19 October, he began to rave and called for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to return to Greece. Worried about her son, and knowing that his grandmother was the only other royal still in favor with the Venizelists, Sophia asked Olga to go to Athens to care for Alexander. After several days of negotiations, the dowager queen obtained permission to return to Greece but, delayed by rough seas, she arrived twelve hours after her grandson's death on 25 October. On 29 October, Alexander was buried at Tatoi; Olga was the only member of the royal family at the funeral.\n\nStill opposed to the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George, the government of Eleftherios Venizelos offered the throne to Constantine's third son, Prince Paul, who refused to ascend the throne before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state. Only days after Alexander's death, however, Venizelos was defeated in a general election. On 17 November, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, regent since the death of Alexander, retired and the new prime minister, Dimitrios Rallis, asked Olga to assume the regency. She served as regent for about a month until her son Constantine returned to the throne on 19 December after a referendum in his favor.\n\nConstantine I returned to the throne 18 months into the Greco-Turkish War, launched in May 1919. In September 1921, the Greek defeat at the battle of Sakarya marked the beginning of the Greek retreat from Turkey. Resentment among the allies for Constantine's policy during World War I prevented Athens from receiving outside support. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the new leader of Turkey, regained Smyrna and Eastern Thrace, annexed by Athens at the end of World War I.\n\nFollowing a coup by disgruntled military officers, Constantine I abdicated for a second time on 27 September 1922. With several other members of his family, including Queen Olga, he went into exile in Italy and his eldest son succeeded him for a few months on the throne as George II. Within months, Constantine died in Italy. One of Olga's sons, Prince Andrew, was among those arrested by the new regime. Many defendants in the treason trials that followed the coup were shot, including senior politicians and generals. Foreign diplomats assumed that Andrew was also in mortal danger, and George V of the United Kingdom, Alfonso XIII of Spain, the French president Raymond Poincaré and Pope Pius XI sent representatives to Athens to intercede on his behalf. Andrew, though spared, was banished for life and his family (including the infant Prince Philip, later Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Queen Elizabeth II) fled into exile in December 1922 aboard a British cruiser, HMS \"Calypso\".\n\nUnlike her children and grandchildren, Olga was given a pension by the government of the Second Hellenic Republic, but she maintained so many of the faithful old servants who had fled Greece with her that she was usually left with no more than 20 pounds sterling per month (worth about £ in prices) to meet her own expenses. She could, however, count on the support of her family, scattered throughout Western Europe. In the United Kingdom, she shared her time between Spencer House, London, the residence of her youngest son, Prince Christopher; Regent's Park, where her daughter, Grand Duchess Marie, rented a mansion; Sandringham House, the home of her sister-in-law, Queen Alexandra; and Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace, where her nephew, King George V, lent apartments.\nOlga's final years were marked by ill health. Lameness restricted her to a wheelchair, and she stayed in Paris several times to undergo treatment for her eyes. Her poor eyesight caused George V much laughter when she mistook a statue of a naked Lady Godiva for one of Queen Victoria. Increasingly dependent, Olga finally settled with her youngest son, Prince Christopher, shortly after the death of his first wife, Princess Anastasia, in 1923. Olga died on 18 June 1926 either at Christopher's Villa Anastasia in Rome, or at Pau, France.\n\nDespite republicanism in Greece, Olga was still held in high esteem and the republican government in Athens offered to pay for her funeral and repatriate her remains to Greece. Nonetheless, her children declined the offer, preferring to bury her in Italy beside her son, Constantine I, whose body Greece had refused to accept. Her funeral was held on 22 June 1926 at the Orthodox Church in Rome and the next day she was laid to rest in the crypt of the Russian church in Florence. After the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 she was re-interred at Tatoi on 17 November 1936.\n\nAs much of her property had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in \"The Times\" to be worth £100,000 (). This was shared between her children and the children of Constantine I. Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.\n\n"}

These composite works would consist mainly of portions of other composers' work, although they could also include original composition. The portions borrowed from other composers would be more or less freely adapted, especially in the case of arias in \"pasticcio\" operas by substituting a new text for the original one. In late 18th-century English \"pasticcios\", for instance by Samuel Arnold or William Shield, the \"borrowed\" music could be Irish or British folksongs.\n\nInstrumental works would also sometimes be assembled from pre-existing compositions, a notable instance of this being the first four piano concertos of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. These concertos (K. 37, 39–41) were assembled almost entirely from keyboard sonata movements by contemporary composers, to which the boy Mozart added orchestral parts supporting the keyboard soloist.\n\n\n"}

With the rise of the gay rights movement, pink money has gone from being a fringe or marginalized market to a thriving industry in many parts of the Western world such as the United States and United Kingdom. Many businesses now specifically cater to gay customers, including nightclubs, shops, restaurants, and even taxicabs; the demand for these services stems from common discrimination by traditional businesses. \n\nIn 2015, LGBT adults in the United States held a combined buying power of approximately $917 billion. This figure exceeded that held by Asian Americans while nearing that of both black and Hispanic Americans. \n\nThe economic power of pink money has been seen as a positive force for the gay community, creating a kind of \"financial self-identification\" which helps gay and lesbian individuals feel like part of a community which values them. Indeed, upwards of 90% of gay people support businesses which target pink money, while actively boycotting anti-gay companies. However, criticism has been leveled at businesses which target pink money from gay groups, arguing that this segregates the gay and lesbian community from society, and holds back gay rights.\n\nIt's been considered more often than not a market exclusive for USA, UK and some places in Europe, but its extension covers a large amount of Latin America and part of Asia, making its actual earns larger by year and giving marketing options some impulse and variety.\n\nKnown as the pink pound in the United Kingdom, the British gay market is estimated to be worth up to £6 billion a year.\n\nThe Pink Pound is often considered to be responsible for the high sales of specific products seen to be favored by a large number of gay people, most noticeably music sales of records by gay icons such as Madonna, Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue and Cher. A range of large corporations have recently realised the power of the Pink Pound and have begun to directly market their products towards the gay community through advertising in the gay press. In June 2006 a specialized marketing conference called the Pink Pound Conference was held in London and a similar conference was held in November 2006 by the Market Research Society.\n\nGroups and organizations concerned with the ghettoisation, conformity, and commercialism of the pink pound include OutRage!, the NUS LGBT Campaign and the Queer Youth Alliance—paralleling the more general criticisms of pink money.\n\nA large market of goods and services for gay people has appeared in recent years, including gay wedding services, gay press including radio and television, and domestic services such as builders and plumbers. In 2001 several gay companies produced pink stickers and stuck them onto thousands of Pound Coins which are still in circulation.\n\nKnown as the pink dollar or \"Dorothy dollar\" in the United States, estimates of the US LGBT market put its value at approximately $790 billion in the year 2012. In addition, many of these households are known by demographers as \"DINKY\"—which generally have more disposable income.\n\nSome US industries have tried to focus on these markets with specific advertising campaigns; for example, American Airlines saw its earnings from LGBT people rise from $20 million in 1994 to $193.5 million in 1999, after formation of a team devoted to gay and lesbian marketing.\n\nIn politics, pink money has been viewed as controversial, mainly due to pressure from conservative groups promoting traditional values—for instance, Presidential Candidate Michael Dukakis publicly disassociated himself from pink money during the 1988 US presidential election. However, more recently pink money has become politically acceptable, especially as a major source of liberal funding for the Democratic Party—in 2000, contributing $5 million to the Democratic National Committee alone, \"a total that puts them among the top tier of Democratic givers, along with unions, [and] trial lawyers\". Major candidates such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Edwards, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Howard Dean, John Kerry, and Joe Biden have actively campaigned for the gay vote.\n\nSince around 2005, Bob Witeck's Washington, D.C.-based communications firm Witeck Communications has conducted an annual buying power study of U.S. gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender adults. In 2016, Witeck's analysis determined that the combined buying power of American LGBT adults was $917 billion in 2015, a 3.7% increase from the previous year. This figure approached the combined buying power of other American minority groups, such as black Americans ($1.2 trillion) and Hispanic Americans ($1.3 trillion), and exceeds that of Asian Americans ($825 billion).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45387", "title": "Polish literature", "text": "Polish literature\n\nPolish literature is the literary tradition of Poland. Most Polish literature has been written in the Polish language, though other languages used in Poland over the centuries have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including Latin, Yiddish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, German and Esperanto. According to Czesław Miłosz, for centuries Polish literature focused more on drama and poetic self-expression than on fiction (dominant in the English speaking world). The reasons were manifold, but mostly rested on historical circumstances of the nation. Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write, including historical cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland (as the crossroads of Europe); but also, Poland's own collective incongruities demanding adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period.\n\nThe period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century. One of the leading Polish Enlightenment authors included Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801) and Jan Potocki (1761–1815). Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation. Early Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics. Notable writers included Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczyński, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki. In the second period, many Polish Romantics worked abroad. Influential poets included Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński.\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed January Uprising, the new period of Polish Positivism began to advocate skepticism and the exercise of reason. The modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland's return to independence (1918). Notable authors included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanisław Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The neo-Romantic era was exemplified by the works of Stefan Żeromski, Władysław Reymont, Gabriela Zapolska, and Stanisław Wyspiański. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his patriotic Trilogy inspiring a new sense of hope. Literature of the Second Polish Republic (1918-1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. New avant-garde writers included Tuwim, Witkacy, Gombrowicz, Miłosz, Dąbrowska and Nałkowska.\n\nIn the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. Out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature. \nMuch of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by Nałkowska, Rudnicki, Borowski and others. The situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by minister Sokorski. Poland had three Nobel Prize winning authors in the later 20th century: Isaac Bashevis Singer (1978), Czesław Miłosz (1980) and Wisława Szymborska (1996).\n\nAlmost nothing remains of Polish literature prior to the country's Christianization in 966. Poland's pagan inhabitants certainly possessed an oral literature extending to Slavic songs, legends and beliefs, but early Christian writers did not deem it worthy of mention in the obligatory Latin, and so it has perished.\n\nWithin the Polish literary tradition, it is customary to include works that have dealt with Poland, even if not written by ethnic Poles. This is the case with Gallus Anonymus, the first historian to have described Poland in his work entitled \"Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum\" (Deeds of the Princes of the Poles), composed in sophisticated Latin. Gallus was a foreign monk who accompanied King Bolesław III Wrymouth in his return from Hungary to Poland. The important tradition of Polish historiography was continued by Wincenty Kadłubek, a thirteenth-century Bishop of Kraków, as well as Jan Długosz, a Polish priest and secretary to Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki.\n\nThe first recorded sentence in the Polish language reads: \"Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\" (\"Let me grind, and you take a rest\") — a paraphrase of the Latin \"Sine, ut ego etiam molam.\" The work, in which this phrase appeared, reflects the culture of early Poland. The sentence was written within the Latin language chronicle \"Liber fundationis\" from between 1269 and 1273, a history of the Cistercian monastery in Henryków, Silesia. It was recorded by an abbot known simply as Piotr (Peter), referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier. The sentence was supposedly uttered by a Bohemian settler, Bogwal (\"Bogwalus Boemus\"), a subject of Bolesław the Tall, expressing compassion for his own wife who \"very often stood grinding by the quern-stone.\" Most notable early medieval Polish works in Latin and the Old Polish language include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the Polish language entitled the \"Holy Cross Sermons\", as well as the earliest Polish-language \"Bible of Queen Zofia\" and the \"Chronicle of Janko of Czarnków\" from the 14th century, not to mention the \"Puławy Psalter\".\n\nMost early texts in Polish vernacular were influenced heavily by the Latin sacred literature. They include \"Bogurodzica\" (Mother of God), a hymn in praise of the Virgin Mary written down in the 15th century, though popular at least a century earlier. \"Bogurodzica\" served as a national anthem. It was one of the first texts reproduced in Polish on a printing press; and so was the \"Master Polikarp's Conversation with Death\" (Rozmowa mistrza Polikarpa ze śmiercią).\n\nIn the early 1470s, one of the first printing houses in Poland was set up by Kasper Straube in Kraków (see: spread of the printing press). In 1475 Kasper Elyan of Glogau (Głogów) set up a printing shop in Breslau (Wrocław), Silesia. Twenty years later, the first Cyrillic printing house was founded at Kraków by Schweipolt Fiol for Eastern Orthodox Church hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include \"Saint Florian's Breviary,\" printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; \"Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia\" (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers; as well as Jan Długosz's \"Chronicle\" from the 15th century and his \"Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium\".\n\nWith the advent of the Renaissance, the Polish language was finally accepted on an equal footing with Latin. Polish culture and art flourished under Jagiellonian rule, and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing with them new literary trends. Such writers included Kallimach (Filippo Buonaccorsi) and Conrad Celtis. Many Polish writers studied abroad, and at the Kraków Academy, which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents. In 1488 the world's first literary society, the \"Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana\" (Vistula Literary Society) was founded in Kraków. Notable members included Conrad Celtes, Albert Brudzewski, Filip Callimachus and Laurentius Corvinus.\n\nA Polish writer who used Latin as his principal vehicle of expression was Klemens Janicki (\"Ianicius\"), who became one of the most notable Latin poets of his time and was laureled by the Pope. Other writers such as Mikołaj Rej, and Jan Kochanowski, laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the Polish language appeared in this period - It was a prayer-book by Biernat of Lublin (ca. 1465 – after 1529) called \"Raj duszny\" (\"Hortulus Animae\", Eden of the Soul), printed in Kraków in 1513 at one of Poland's first printing establishments, operated by Florian Ungler (originally from Bavaria). The most notable Polish writers and poets active in the 16th century include:\nThe literature in the period of Polish Baroque (between 1620 and 1764) was significantly influenced by the great popularization of Jesuit high schools, which offered education based on Latin classics as part of a preparation for a political career. The studies of poetry required the practical knowledge of writing both Latin and Polish poems, which radically increased the number of poets and versifiers countrywide. On the soil of humanistic education some exceptional writers grew as well: Piotr Kochanowski (1566–1620) gave his translation of Torquato Tasso's \"Jerusalem Delivered\"; Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, a poet laureate, became known among European nations as \"Horatius christianus \" (Christian Horace) for his Latin writings; Jan Andrzej Morsztyn (1621–1693), an epicurean courtier and diplomat, extolled in his sophisticated poems the valors of earthly delights; and Wacław Potocki (1621–1696), the most productive writer of the Polish Baroque, unified the typical opinions of Polish szlachta with some deeper reflections and existential experiences. Notable Polish writers and poets active in this period include:\nThe period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century during the reign of Poland's last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. It went into sharp decline with the Third and final Partition of Poland (1795), followed by political, cultural and economic destruction of the country, and leading to the Great Emigration of Polish elites. The Enlightenment ended around 1822, and was replaced by Polish Romanticism at home and abroad.\n\nOne of the leading Polish Enlightenment poets was Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801), known locally as \"the Prince of Poets\" and Poland's La Fontaine, author of the first Polish novel called \"The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom\" (Mikołaja Doświadczyńskiego przypadki); he was also a playwright, journalist, encyclopedist and translator from French and Greek. Another prominent writer of the period was Jan Potocki (1761–1815), a Polish nobleman, Egyptologist, linguist, and adventurer, whose travel memoirs made him legendary in his homeland. Outside Poland he is known chiefly for his novel, \"The Manuscript Found in Saragossa,\" which has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the \"Decameron\" and \"the Arabian Nights\".\nNotable Polish writers and poets of the Enlightenment period include:\nDue to partitions carried out by the neighboring empires – which ended the existence of the sovereign Polish state in 1795 – Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation, and expressed the ideals and the traditional way of life of the Polish people. The period of Romanticism in Poland ended with the Tsarist suppression of the January 1863 Uprising, marked by public executions by the Russians and deportations to Siberia.\n\nThe literature of Polish Romanticism falls into two distinct periods, both defined by insurgencies: the first around 1820–1830, ending with the November Uprising of 1830; and the second between 1830–1864, giving birth to Polish Positivism. In the first period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics - Their art featured emotionalism and imagination, folklore, country life, as well as the propagation of the ideals of independence. The most famous writers of the period were: Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczyński, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki. In the second period (after the January Uprising), many Polish Romantics worked abroad, often banished from the Polish soil by the occupying power. Their work became dominated by the ideals of freedom and the struggle for regaining their country's lost sovereignty. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. Also in that period, the idea of the \"poeta-wieszcz\" (nation's bard) developed. The \"wieszcz\" functioned as spiritual leader to the suppressed people. The most notable poet among the \"leading bards of Romanticism, so recognized in both periods, was Adam Mickiewicz. Other two national poets were: Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński. Polish writers and poets of the Romantic period include:\nIn the aftermath of the failed January 1863 Uprising against Russian occupation, the new period of Polish Positivism—which took its name from Auguste Comte's philosophy of Positivism—advocated skepticism and the exercise of reason. Questions addressed by Poland's Positivist writers revolved around \"organic work,\" which included the establishment of equal rights for all members of society, including feminists; the assimilation of Poland's Jewish minority; and the defense of the Polish population in the German-ruled part of Poland against \"Kulturkampf\" Germanization and the displacement of the Polish population by German settlers. The writers worked to educate the public about constructive patriotism, which would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated \"social organism\", regardless of adverse circumstances. Poland's Positivist period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the Young Poland movement. Prominent writers and poets of Polish Positivism included:\nThe modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland's return to independence (1918). The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong aesthetic opposition to the ideals of its own predecessor (promoting \"organic work\" in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in decadence, symbolism, conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of art for art's sake. Prominent authors who followed this trend included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanisław Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The later ideology emerged in conjunction with the socio-political upheavals across Europe such as the 1905 Revolution against Nicholas II of Russia, the Norwegian independence, the Moroccan Crisis and others. It was a continuation of romanticism, often called neo-romanticism. The artists and writers following this idea covered a large variety of topics: from the sense of personal mission of a Pole exemplified by Stefan Żeromski's prose, through condemnation of social inequality in works by Władysław Reymont and Gabriela Zapolska, to criticism of Polish society and Polish revolutionary history by Stanisław Wyspiański. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his patriotic Trilogy inspiring a new sense of hope. Writers of this period include:\nLiterature of the Second Polish Republic (1918-1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. In large part, derivative of these changes was the collective and unobstructed development of programs for artists and writers. New avant-garde trends had emerged. The period, spanning just twenty years, was full of notable individualities who saw themselves as exponents of changing European civilization, including Tuwim, Witkacy, Gombrowicz, Miłosz, Dąbrowska and Nałkowska (PAL). They all contributed to a new model of the twentieth-century Polish culture echoing its own language of everyday life.\n\nThe two decades of Interbellum were marked by rapid development in the field of poetry, undivided and undiminished for the first time in over a century. From 1918 to 1939, the gradual and successive introduction of new ideas resulted in the formation of separate and distinct trends. The first decade of Polish interwar poetry was clear, constructive, and optimistic; as opposed to the second decade marked by dark visions of the impending war, internal conflicts within the Polish society, and growing pessimism. The whole period was amazingly rich nevertheless. In 1933 the Polish Academy of Literature (PAL) was founded by a decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic (Rada Ministrów RP); as the highest opinion-forming authority in the country; it awarded Gold and the Silver Laurels (Złoty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn), the two highest national honors for contributions to literature until invasion of Poland in 1939. One of the most prominent poets of the interwar period was Bolesław Leśmian (member of PAL), whose creative personality developed before 1918, and in large part influenced both Interbellum decades (until his death in 1937). The literary life of his contemporaries revolved mostly around the issues of independence. All Polish poets treated the concept of freedom with extreme seriousness, and many patriotic works had emerged at that time, not to mention a particular variant of a poetic cult of Piłsudski.\n\nIn the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. The environment was chaotic, and the writers scattered: some found themselves in concentration and labor camps (or Nazi-era ghettos), others were deported out of the country; some emigrated (Tuwim, Wierzyński), many more joined the ranks of the Polish underground resistance movement (Baczyński, Borowski, Gajcy). All literary outlets were forced to cease operation. Writers who remained at home began organizing literary life in conspiracy, including lectures, evenings of poetry, and secret meetings in the homes of writers and art facilitators. Polish cities where such meetings were held most frequently were: Warsaw, Kraków and Lwów. Writers participated in setting-up of the underground presses (out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature). Many fought in the Polish army in exile or resisted the Holocaust in a civil capacity. The generation of the \"Kolumbs,\" born around 1920, were active during the Warsaw Uprising. Best-known representatives of the war years are:\n\nAll texts published under Soviet rules were strictly censored.\nMuch of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by Nałkowska, Rudnicki, Borowski and others. The Soviet takeover of the country did not discourage Émigrés and exiles from returning, especially before the advent of Stalinism. Indeed, many writers attempted to recreate the Polish literary scene, often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality, including Jerzy Andrzejewski, author of \"Ashes and Diamonds\", describing (accoording to Communist design) Anti-communist resistance in Poland. His novel was adapted into film a decade later by Wajda. The new emerging prose writers such as Stanisław Dygat and Stefan Kisielewski approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective. Kazimierz Wyka coined a term \"borderline novel\" for documentary fiction.\n\nThe situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by minister Sokorski, on behalf of the increasingly violent Communist regime, which engaged in gross violations of human rights. In the years 1944–1956, around 300,000 Polish citizens were arrested, of whom many thousands were sentenced to long-term imprisonment. There were 6,000 death sentences pronounced against political prisoners, the majority of them carried out \"in the majesty of the law\". Fearing for their proper jobs, many writers associated with the Borejsza's publishing empire embraced the Sovietization of Polish culture. In 1953 the ZLP Union, run by Kruczkowski with a slew of prominent signatories, declared full support to persecution of religious leaders by the Ministry of Public Security. Death sentences were not enforced, although Father Fudali died in unexplained circumstances, as had 37 other priest and 54 friars already before 1953. Likewise, writer Kazimierz Moczarski from Armia Krajowa (the Home Army), tortured in jail by Romkowski's subordinates for several years and sentenced to death, was pardoned and released only at the end of this period.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33456439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33456439", "title": "Prospection", "text": "Prospection\n\nIn psychology, prospection is the generation and evaluation of mental representations of possible futures. The term therefore captures a wide array of future-oriented psychological phenomena, including the prediction of future emotion (affective forecasting), the imagination of future scenarios (episodic foresight), and planning. Prospection is central to various aspects of human cognition and motivation. Daniel Gilbert (psychologist) and Timothy Wilson coined the term in 2007. It has since become a central area of enquiry in the cognitive sciences \n\nEven fundamental learning processes are, in some sense, forms of prospection . Associative learning enables individual animals to track local regularities in their environments and adapt their behaviour accordingly, in order to maximise their chances of positive outcomes and minimise risks. Animals that are capable of positive and negative states (for example pleasure and pain) can eventually learn about the consequences of their actions and thereby predict imminent rewards and punishments before they occur. This enables animals to change their current actions accordingly in line with prospective consequences. \n\nMental time travel refers to the ability to mentally reconstruct personal events from the past (known as episodic memory), as well as to imagine personal future events (known as episodic foresight). Mental time travel into the future (episodic foresight or episodic future thinking) is therefore one of several types of ‘prospection’ that refers to the capacity to simulate or imagine personal future events . \n\nEpisodic foresight is the capacity to imagine personal future scenarios and shape current action accordingly . \n\nThe feelings evoked during episodic foresight enable people to infer how they would really feel if the event were to happen in reality. This thereby enables people to anticipate whether future events are desirable or undesirable, and ability called ‘affective forecasting’. \n\nSimulating the future enables people to create intentions for future actions. Prospective memory is the form of memory that involves remembering to perform these planned intentions, or to recall them at some future point in time . Prospective memory tasks are common in everyday life, ranging from remembering to post a letter to remembering to take one’s medication. \n\nPeople anticipate that it is possible to shape their future self. To acquire new knowledge or additional skills, people therefore engage in repeated actions driven by the goal to improve these future capacities. This deliberate practice is essential not only for elite performance but also in the acquirement of numerous everyday feats. \n\nIntertemporal choices are choices with outcomes that play out over time . Such decisions are ubiquitous in everyday life, ranging from routine decisions about what to eat for lunch (i.e. whether to adhere to a diet) to more profound decisions about climate change (i.e. whether to reduce current energy expenditure to avoid delayed costs). The ability to imagine future scenarios and adjust decisions accordingly may be important for making intertemporal choices in a flexible manner that accords with delayed consequences. Accumulating evidence suggests that cuing people to imagine the future in vivid detail can encourage preferences for delayed outcomes over immediate ones . This has been extended into real-world decisions such as in reducing the consumption of high-calorie food and increasing pro-environmental behaviours. \n\nIn recent years there have been a range of investigations into variation in prospection and its functions in clinical populations. Deficits to the mechanisms and functions of prospection have been observed in Alzheimer’s disease and other age-related dementias, Schizophrenia, and after brain damage (especially to the medial temporal lobes). \n\nShifts in the content and modes of prospection have been observed in affective disorders. For example, in both clinical depression and anxiety there is an overrepresentation of possible negative future events. In depression, there is additionally a reduction in the generation of possible positive future events. There are also a range of changes to the representational format (i.e. whether people tend to represent the future in episodic or semantic detail) in affective disorders . \n\n"}

{"id": "1543903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1543903", "title": "Ribbon development", "text": "Ribbon development\n\nRibbon development is building houses along the routes of communications radiating from a human settlement. Such development generated great concern in the United Kingdom during the 1920s and the 1930s as well as in numerous other countries.\n\nNormally and the very first ribbons are focussed on roads. Following the Industrial Revolution, ribbon development became prevalent along railway lines: predominantly in Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However the cost of building stations, their attraction and need for accompanying roads usually led to new small urban centres and broader settlements. Ribbon development created great attractiveness on isolated roads as increasing motor car ownership meant that houses could be sold easily even if they were remote from workplaces and urban centres. It was attractive to developers because they did not have to waste money or plot space constructing roads. It also enabled spaces at the interstice between several urban areas appealing to potential buyers needing to access either or many of these.\n\nThe extent of the practice around roads led to its problems becoming intense and recognition as an inefficient use of resources, requiring bypass roads to be built, and often a precursor to untrammelled urban sprawl, so a key aim for the United Kingdom's post-war planning system was to implement a presumption and convention that proposed new ribbon development is inappropriate. Urban sprawl/suburbanisation of large areas led to the introduction of green belt policies, new towns, planned suburbs and garden cities.\n\nFollowing the Industrial Revolution, ribbon development became prevalent along railway lines: predominantly in Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A good example of this was the deliberate promotion of Metro-land along London's Metropolitan Railway. Similar evidence can be found from Long Island (where Frederick W Dunton bought much real estate to encourage New Yorkers to settle along the Long Island Rail Road lines), Boston and across the American Midwest.\n\nIt can also occur along ridge lines, canals and coastlines, the last occurring especially as people seeking seachange lifestyles build their houses where they can get the best view.\n\nThe resulting towns and cities are often difficult to service efficiently. Often, the first problems noticed by residents is traffic congestion, as people compete to move along the narrow urban corridor while ever more people join the ribbon further along the corridor. Urban consolidation is often a solution to encourage growth towards a more compact urban form.\n\nRibbon development can also be compared with a linear village, a village that grew along a transportation route, not as part of a city's expansion.\n\nRibbon development has long been viewed as an especial problem in the Republic of Ireland, where \"one-off houses\" proliferate on rural roads. This causes difficulties in the efficient supply of water, sewerage, broadband, electricity, telephones and public transport. In 1998, Frank McDonald contrasted development in the Republic with that in Northern Ireland: \"Enniskillen [\"in Northern Ireland\"] is well defined with clear boundaries to the town and well-laid-out shopping streets. Letterkenny, [\"in the Republic\"] by contrast, appears as just one long street with bungalow development trailing off over all the surrounding hills.\" The houses (ofter disparaged as \"McMansions\") are also criticised for spoiling countryside scenery: Monaghan County Council in 2013 declared that \"The Council will resist development that would create or extend ribbon development.\" Tipperary County Council and many other councils have adopted similar policies.\n\n"}

All these scripts are believed to be descendants of the Proto-Sinaitic script. That script was used by the ancient Israelites, both Jews and Samaritans. The better-known \"square script\" Hebrew alphabet traditionally used by Jews is a stylized version of the Aramaic alphabet called \"Assyrian writing\" (כתב אשורי) which they adopted from the Persian Empire (which in turn adopted it from the Arameans). After the fall of the Persian Empire, Judaism used both scripts before settling on the Aramaic form. For a limited time thereafter, the use of paleo-Hebrew (proto-Samaritan) among Jews was retained only to write the Tetragrammaton, but soon that custom was also abandoned.\n\nThe Samaritan alphabet first became known to the Western world with the publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1631 by Jean Morin.

To be put into service as a secure signature creation device (SSCD), the device must meet the rigorous requirements laid out under Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (eIDAS), where it is referred to as a qualified electronic signature creation device. Using secure signature creation devices helps in facilitating online business processes that save time and money with transactions made within the public and private sectors.\nThe minimum requirements that must be met to elevate an electronic signature creation device to the level of a secure signature creation device are provided in Annex II of eIDAS. Through appropriate procedural and technical means, the device must reasonably assure the confidentiality of the data used to create an electronic signature. It further must ensure that the data used to create an electronic signature is unique and only used once. Lastly it shall only allow a qualified trust service provider or certificate authority to create or manage a signatory’s electronic signature data.\n\nTo ensure security, signature creation data used by the SSCD to create an electronic signature must provide reasonable protection through current technology to prevent forgery or duplication of the signature. The creation data must remain under the sole control of its signatory to prevent unauthorized use. The SSCD itself is prohibited from altering the signature’s accompanying data.\n\nWhen a trust service provider or certificate authority places an SSCD into service, they must securely prepare the device according to Annex II of eIDAS in fully compliance to the following three conditions:\n\nThe secure signature creation device must also meet the international standard for computer security certification, referred to as the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (ISO/IEC 15408). This standard gives computer system users the ability to specify security requirements via Protection Profiles (PPs) for security functional requirements (SFRs) and security assurance requirements (SARs). The trust service provider or certificate authority is the required to implement the specified requirements and attest to their product’s security attributes. A third-party testing laboratory then evaluates the device to ensure that the level of security is as claimed by the provider.\n\nWhen a secure signature creation device is used as part of a central authentication service (CAS), it may act as a CAS server in multi-tier authentication scenarios. The CAS software protocol allows users to be authenticated when signing into a web application.\n\nThe common scheme for a CAS protocol includes the client’s web browser, an application requesting authentication and the CAS server. When authentication is needed, the application will send a request to the CAS server. The server will then compare the user’s credentials against its database. If the information matches, the CAS will respond that the user has been authenticated.\n\neIDAS has provided a tiered approach to determining the legal implications of electronic signatures. A signature that has been created with a secure signature creation device is considered to have the strongest probative value. A document or message that has been signed with such a device is non-reputable, meaning the signatory cannot deny they are responsible for the creation of the signature.\n\nRegulation (EU) No 910/2014 (eIDAS) evolved from Directive 1999/93/EC, the Electronic Signatures Directive. The intent of the directive was to make EU Member States responsible for creating legislation that would allow for the creation of the European Union’s electronic signing system. The eIDAS Regulation required all Member States to follow its specifications for electronic signatures by its effective date of 1 July 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "19898520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19898520", "title": "Shaughnessy playoff system", "text": "Shaughnessy playoff system\n\nThe Shaughnessy playoff system is a method of determining the champion of a sports league that is not in a divisional alignment. This format is also known as the Argus finals system. It involves the participation of the top four teams in the league standings in a single elimination tournament. While the first round of the playoffs involve the pairing of the first- and fourth-place teams in one contest (whether it be a single game or a series of games) and the second- and third-place teams in the other, a variant of the Shaughnessy playoffs would pair the first- and third-place teams in one semifinal round and the second- and fourth-place teams in the other. In either variant, the winners of the first two games would then compete for the league championship. Some lower-level leagues use a Shaughnessy playoff for purposes of promotion to the next-higher league.\n\nAnother variant of the Shaughnessy system exempts a certain number of top teams from the playoffs (usually one to three teams) and instead involves the next four teams in the league standings. This variation is almost always used by a lower-level league for promotion purposes. Typically, the exempted top finishers earn automatic promotion and the playoffs determine the final promotion place.\n\nThe Shaughnessy playoff system was implemented in 1933 by Frank Shaughnessy, the general manager of the Montreal Royals minor league baseball team of the International League. After its successful implementation by the International League, the popularity of the new postseason format spread to other leagues in other sports, including the All-America Football Conference (which used the Shaughnessy playoff system in the league's last season of existence) and the minor American football league American Association, which used the format in five of its championship seasons. The format has also been widely used in minor league baseball on all levels.\n\nIn the Original Six era of the National Hockey League (1942-1967), the circuit adopted a Shaughnessy playoff system (first place \"vs.\" third place and second place \"vs.\" fourth place) in which the paired teams played in a best-four-of-seven-games series with the winners advancing to the Stanley Cup championship round. A Shaughnessy-style format is used in today's NHL in an entirely different context—since 2016, the All-Star Game has been contested as a four-team knockout tournament, with each team drawn exclusively from one of the league's four divisions. Each \"game\" is played in a three-on-three format (i.e., three skaters and one goaltender, unless affected by penalties) over a single 20-minute period (the same length of a period in a regular NHL game).\n\nSince its first season in 2013, the National Women's Soccer League has used a Shaughnessy playoff (using 1–4 and 2–3 semifinal pairings) to determine its champion.\n\nIn NCAA college basketball, one Division I conference uses a Shaughnessy playoff for its postseason tournaments for men and women. The Ivy League launched postseason tournaments for both sexes in the 2016–17 season; the top four teams in the regular-season conference standings advance to a Shaughnessy tournament (also using 1–4 and 2–3 semifinal pairings) at a predetermined site. The winners receive the Ivies' automatic berths in the NCAA men's and women's tournaments.\n\nMore recently, the Shaughnessy playoff system has been adopted outside of North America. In English rugby union, the format is currently used to determine the winner of the Premiership, and from 2012–13 through to 2016–17 was also used in the second-level RFU Championship to determine the team to be promoted to the Premiership. The Premiership and Championship formats differ only in the number of games contested—the Premiership playoff uses one-off matches, while all matches in the Championship playoff were two-legged. The Premier 15s, launched in autumn 2017 as the new top flight of English women's rugby, uses the same playoff format as the Premiership. The Celtic League in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, now known as Pro14, adopted a system identical to that of the Premiership starting in 2009–10, the season before that league expanded to include two teams from Italy. The Shaughnessy system was replaced by a six-team playoff when two South African sides joined the league in 2017–18, bringing it to its current 14-team roster.\n\nIn French rugby union, a Shaughnessy-style playoff was used to determine the second of two promotion spots in the second-tier Rugby Pro D2 through the 2016–17 season, with the teams involved being the second- through fifth-placed teams, as the first-place team earned automatic promotion to the Top 14. This system has been abandoned for 2017–18 and beyond in favor of a six-team playoff system identical to that currently used in the Top 14, with only the Pro D2 champion earning automatic promotion and the runner-up advancing to a promotion/relegation playoff with the second-from-bottom Top 14 side. Previously, the pure Shaughnessy system had been used to determine the Top 14 champion, but that league's playoffs expanded to six teams starting in 2009–10.\n\nThe Super League in rugby league, made up primarily of English sides with one from France, adopted a Shaughnessy playoff beginning in 2015. This follows a 22-match home-and-away league season and a single round-robin mini-league involving the top eight clubs from the home-and-away season. In addition, the second-level Championship adopted a Shaughnessy playoff for its Championship Shield, and the third-level League 1 adopted a Shaughnessy-style promotion playoff similar to that formerly used by Rugby Pro D2. In the Championship, the bottom eight teams at the end of the league season enter their own single round-robin mini-league, with the top four teams at the end of that phase entering a Shaughnessy playoff for the Shield. In League 1, the top team at the end of the league season is automatically promoted to the following season's Championship. The second- through fifth-place teams then enter a Shaughnessy-style playoff for the second promotion place.\n\nSome association football leagues use Shaughnessy-style playoffs for promotion purposes. Among the countries using such a system are:\n\nIn rugby union, the Shaughnessy system has been widely used throughout the SANZAAR countries of South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina.\n\nThe Super Rugby competition, initially featuring teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, used the Shaughnessy format throughout its history as the Super 12 and Super 14, ending in 2010. The competition's expansion to 15 teams as Super Rugby in 2011 saw the playoffs expand to six teams, with three conference champions and three \"wild cards\" advancing. With the addition of three more teams in 2016 (with two of the new entries in Argentina and Japan), the playoffs now involve eight teams, with four conference champions and four \"wild cards\". The format was discontinued in the Super Rugby competition for the 2017 season.\n\nIn South Africa, the Currie Cup uses a Shaughnessy playoff to determine the champions of both of its divisions (Premier and First).\n\nIn New Zealand, the professional Mitre 10 Cup (formerly Air New Zealand Cup and ITM Cup) adopted the Shaughnessy format in 2009, after having used an eight-team playoff bracket in its first two seasons in 2007 and 2008. In 2011, the then-ITM Cup split into two divisions, effectively re-creating the three-division system that existed in the National Provincial Championship era. The playoffs in both the Premiership and Championship divisions use the Shaughnessy system except in World Cup years, in which only the top two teams contest a final. Since its inception in 2007, the amateur Heartland Championship has used the Shaughnessy system, implemented at the last group stage, to determine the winners of both of its trophies, the Meads and Lochore Cups.\n\nAustralia's National Rugby Championship, which began play in 2014, uses a Shaughnessy playoff. The country's previous attempt to establish a national league, the Australian Rugby Championship, also used a Shaughnessy playoff, but was scrapped after its only season in 2007.\n\nA modified Shaughnessy system has been used by the University Athletic Association of the Philippines for its basketball tournaments since 1993. In the semifinals with a #1 vs. #4 and #2 vs. #3 match-ups, the top two seeds possessing the twice to beat advantage, a variant of the best of three series where the higher seed has 1–0 series lead. The winners advance to the best of three finals; it has never been referred to as the \"Shaughnessy system\" in the country. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted it for their basketball tournaments starting in 1998. It has since been adopted to other sports by other collegiate leagues, and in the Philippine Basketball Association, since then\n\nAs it was used in the playoffs of the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership:\n"}

It was released in Japan on November 17, 2005 and in America on August 5, 2008 (via the PlayStation Store) as \"Talkman Travel\". In America, however, instead of receiving all the languages included in the Japanese version in one package, you have the option to buy a single pack for $5.99 a piece. Available packs are: Paris (French), Rome (Italian), and Tokyo (Japanese).\n\nThe software is designed for travelers and entertainment, mostly containing slang and useful travel phrases. While originally sold in and designed for the Japanese market for Japanese users, its translation function operates between all four languages . In Japan, the software has proven popular with the middle-aged female demographic due to an interest in South Korean products, and Korean-language soap operas and movies; and as a fun English education aid for children .\n\nThis product has also been officially released in Hong Kong with a Traditional Chinese packaging and manual. However, it does not seem that Sony is manufacturing any more of these for the Hong Kong market and most retailers that are sold out claims that it will no longer be restocked.\n\nOutside of pure translations, \"Talkman\" also lets players play games to test their fluency of a language. The program comes with a USB microphone included. This microphone draws power through two gold-colored contacts on the top of the PSP, one on each side of the mini-USB port. This is uncommon due to the ability for most USB products to draw power through USB. These proprietary contacts are similar to the gold-colored contacts on the bottom-right of the device, which are used for charging.\n\nNote: The Chotto Shot (aka \"Go!Cam\") has a built-in microphone that also can be used with the \"Talkman\" program.\n\nFollowing the success of the Asian version of \"Talkman\", a version designed for translating European languages was developed and released on June 16, 2006. \"Talkman Euro\" is available in two versions. The Japanese version contains support for English, Italian, Spanish, German, French, and Japanese, while the Chinese version contains support for Traditional Chinese instead of Japanese. The differences on the packaging (the Japanese flag as opposed to a flag with the word \"mie\" in Chinese) are minimal and hard to notice.\n\n\"Talkman\" is also released as a UMD-only package, so users who already have the USB mic or camera can choose to purchase this standalone version. The Sony PSP Headset has also been confirmed to work with \"Talkman\".\n\n"}

It is based on his CandSc thesis, completed in 1982 at Patrice Lumumba University (now the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia) under the title \"The Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement\", and defended at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn the book, Abbas argues that the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust had been exaggerated and that Zionists created \"the myth\" of six million murdered Jews, which he called a \"fantastic lie\". He further claimed that those Jews who were killed by the Nazis were actually the victims of a Zionist-Nazi plot aimed to fuel vengeance against Jews and to expand their mass extermination. The book also discussed topics such as the Haavara Agreement, in which the Third Reich agreed with the Jewish Agency to facilitate Jewish emigration from Germany to Mandate Palestine.\n\nPortions of \"The Other Side\" have been considered as Holocaust denial by some critics, especially the parts disputing the accepted number of deaths in the Holocaust as well as the accusations that Zionist agitation was the cause of the Holocaust, a charge that Abbas denies.\n\nWhen Abbas was appointed the Palestinian prime minister in 2003, he wrote that the \"Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind\" and that he does not deny it, and said that \"When I wrote \"The Other Side\" … we were at war with Israel. Today I would not have made such remarks\". In 2014, he stated the Holocaust was the \"most heinous crime in the modern era\".\n\nIn 2013 Abbas reasserted part of his thesis to the extend that \"the Zionist movement had ties with the Nazis\".\n\nAbbas attended at Patrice Lumumba University to prepare and present his doctoral thesis. The institute's director at the time, Yevgeny Primakov, appointed a Soviet specialist on Palestine, Vladimir Ivanovich Kisilev as Abbas' dissertation adviser. They communicated mostly in English and Arabic. In an interview with the magazine \"Kommersant\" 20 years later, Kisilev remembers Abbas as a well-prepared graduate student, who came to Moscow with an already chosen research topic and a large amount of already prepared material.\n\nThe title of Abbas' thesis is \"The Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement\" or, in Russian, \"Связи между сионизмом и нацизмом. 1933–1945\". In 1984, a book based on Abbas' doctoral dissertation was published in Arabic by Dar Ibn Rushd publishers in Amman, Jordan under the title \"al-Wajh al-akhar : al-`alaqat al-sirriyah bayna al-Naziyah wa-al-Sihyuniyah\".\n\nIn the doctoral thesis, Abbas describes the number of Jews murdered in the Nazi Holocaust as agreed upon by mainstream historians, six millions, as a \"fantastic lie\". In the book, he wrote:\nIn the book, he wrote:\nAbbas quotes historian Raul Hilberg to support his allegations that fewer than one million Jews were killed. However, Rafael Medoff of the David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies denied the assertion that \"The historian and author, Raoul Hilberg, thinks that the figure does not exceed 890,000\", and said this is \"utterly false\". He wrote that \"Professor Hilberg, a distinguished historian and author of the classic study \"The Destruction of the European Jews\", has never said or written any such thing.\"\n\nAbbas raised doubts regarding the existence of the gas chambers, quoting Robert Faurisson, on the nonexistence of gas chambers.\n\nAdditionally, he stated that the much smaller number of Jews which he reportedly admitted that the Germans did massacre were actually the victims of a Zionist-Nazi plot:\nThe thesis also discussed topics such as the Haavara Agreement of 1933, in which the Third Reich agreed with the Jewish Agency to enable Jews to emigrate from Germany directly to Mandate Palestine, which he sees as evidence of collaboration.\n\nA global survey of Holocaust denial, published by David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies in 2004, describes the book as \"denying the Holocaust\".\n\nAfter Abbas was appointed prime minister of the Palestinian Authority in 2003, the Israel Defense Forces removed excerpts from the Abbas book from its website, including quotes questioning the use of gas chambers and talking of less than one million victims.\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center called for Abbas to clarify his position on the Holocaust in 1995, but he did not do so at that time. Abbas' reported defence when asked about the book was telling: \"When I wrote \"The Other Side\"… we were at war with Israel. Today I would not have made such remarks… Today there is peace and what I write from now on must help advance the peace process.\"\n\nIn his May 2003 interview with \"Haaretz,\" Abbas stated:\n\nAccording to the Ma'an News Agency, in an interview in 2013, Abbas defended his doctoral thesis regarding the relationship between the Zionists and the Nazis and said he \"challenges anyone who can deny that the Zionist movement had ties with the Nazis before World War II.\"\n"}

Although Tsakonian is treated as a dialect of Modern Standard Greek, some compendia treat it as a separate language, since Modern Standard Greek descends from Ionic and Attic which are on the Eastern branch of the Hellenic languages, while Tsakonian (as a descendant of Doric) is the sole surviving member of the Western branch.\n\nTsakonian is critically endangered, with only a few hundred, mostly elderly, fluent speakers left. It is partially mutually intelligible with Standard Modern Greek.\n\nIt is named after its speakers, the Tsakonians, which in turn may be derived from 'exo-Laconians' 'Outer Lakonians'.\n\nTsakonian is found today in a group of mountain towns and villages slightly inland from the Argolic Gulf, although it was once spoken farther to the south and west as well as on the coasts of Laconia (ancient Sparta). There was formerly a Tsakonian colony on the Sea of Marmara (or Propontis; two villages near Gönen, Vatika and Havoutsi), probably dating from the 18th century, whose members were resettled in Greece with the 1924 population exchanges. Propontis Tsakonian appears to have died out around 1970.\n\nGeographical barriers to travel and communication kept the Tsakonians relatively isolated from the rest of Greece until the 19th century, although there was some trade between the coastal towns. The rise of mass education and improved travel beginning after the Greek War of Independence meant that fluent Tsakonian speakers were no longer as isolated from the rest of Greece. In addition, during the war, the Turkish army drove the Tsakonians east, and as a result, their de facto capital shifted from Prastos to Leonidio, further making the people significantly less isolated. There began a rapid decline from an estimated figure of some 200,000 fluent speakers to the present estimate of a speaker count between 200 and 1,000.\n\nSince the introduction of electricity to all villages in Tsakonia by the late 1950s, the Greek mass media can reach the most remote of areas and profoundly affect the speech of younger speakers. Efforts to revive the language by teaching it in local schools do not seem to have had much success. Standard Modern Greek is the official language of government, commerce and education, and it is possible that the continued modernization of Tsakonia will lead to the language's disappearance sometime this century.\n\nThe area where the language is found today in some villages Tsakonia slopes of Parnon in the southern province of Kynouria, including the towns of Leonidio and Tyros and villages of Melana, Agios Andreas, Vaskina, Prastos, Sitaina and Kastanitsa.\n\nTsakonian has no official status. Prayers and liturgies of the Greek Orthodox Church have been translated into Tsakonian, but the ancient Koine of the traditional church services is usually used as in other locations in Greece. Some teaching materials in Tsakonian for use in local schools have reportedly also been produced.\n\nTsakonian is divided by scholars into three dialects, Northern Tsakonian, Southern Tsakonian and Propontis Tsakonian.\n\nAnother difference between Tsakonian and the common Demotic Greek dialect is its verb system – Tsakonian preserves different archaic forms, such as participial periphrasis for the present tense. Certain complementisers and other adverbial features present in the standard Modern Greek dialect are absent from Tsakonian, with the exception of the Modern \"που\" () relativiser, which takes the form \"πφη\" () in Tsakonian (note: traditional Tsakonian orthography uses the digraph \"πφ\" to represent aspirated ). Noun morphology is broadly similar to Standard Modern Greek, although Tsakonian tends to drop the nominative, final \"-ς\" (\"-s\") from masculine nouns, thus Tsakonian \"ο τσχίφτα\" for Standard \"o τρίφτης\" (\"o tshífta\"/\"o tríftis\": \"grater\").\n\nThe Propontis dialect was much more heavily influenced by the modern Thracian dialect, and although there were significant grammatical differences, its vocabulary was much closer to Standard Modern Greek. Compare the Northern and Southern word for water, \"ύο\" (\"ýo\", derived from Ancient Greek ) to Propontic \"νερέ\" and Standard \"νερό\" (\"neré\", \"neró\").\n\nHowever, there has always been contact with Koine Greek speakers and the language was affected by the neighboring Greek dialects. Additionally, there are some lexical borrowings from Arvanitika and Turkish. The core vocabulary remains recognizably Doric, although experts disagree on the extent to which other true Doricisms can be found. There are only a few hundred, mainly elderly true native speakers living, although a great many more can speak the language less than fluently.\n\n\nTsakonian in some words preserves the pre-classical Greek [w]-sound, represented in some Ancient Greek texts by the digamma \"(ϝ)\". In Tsakonian, this sound has become a fricative : \"βάννε\" \"sheep\", corresponding to Ancient \"ϝαμνός\" (Attic \"ἀμνός\").\n\nTsakonian has extensive changes triggered by palatalisation:\n\nIn Southern Tsakonian, is deleted before back and central vowels: \"λόγος\" > Northern \"λόγo\" , Southern \"όγo\" ; \"λούζων\" > Northern \"λούκχου\" , Southern \"ούκχου\" ;\n\nOccasionally > , which appears to reflect an earlier process in Laconian, but in others is retained though the word is absent in Standard Greek: \"θυγάτηρ\" > \"σάτη\" , but Ancient \"θύων\" (Modern \"σφάζω\" ) > \"θύου\" \n\nWord-final > , which reflects an earlier process in Laconian; in Tsakonian, it is a liaison phoneme: \"τίνος\" > \"τσούνερ\" \n\nWord-initial > : \"*ράφων\" > \"σχάφου\" \n\nIn the common verb ending \"-ζω\", > : \"φωνάζων\" > \"φωνιάντου\" \n\nTsakonian avoids clusters, and reduces them to aspirated or prenasalised stops and affricates:\n\n<poem>I had a bird in a cage and I kept it happy\nI gave it sugar and wine-grapes\nand from the great amount of grapes and their essence,\nit got naughty [possibly means it got drunk] and escaped.\nAnd its master now runs after it with the cage in his hands:\nCome my bird back where you belong, come to your house\nI will remove your old bells and buy you new ones.</poem>\n\nTsakonian avoids consonant clusters, as seen, and drops final [s] and [n]; as a result, syllable structure tends more to CV than in Standard Modern Greek. (The use of digraphs in tradition spelling tends to obscure this). For instances, ancient [hadros] \"hard\" goes to Tsakonian [a.tʃe], where /t͡ʃ/ can be considered a single phoneme; it is written traditionally with a trigraph as \"ατσχέ\" (= \"atskhe\").\n\nTsakonian has undergone considerable morphological simplification: there is minimal case inflection.\n\nThe present and imperfect indicative in Tsakonian are formed with participles, like English but unlike the rest of Greek: Tsakonian \"ενεί αού, έμα αού\" \"I am saying, I was saying\" ≈ Greek \"ειμί λαλών, ήμην λαλών\".\n\nTraditionally, Tsakonian used the standard Greek alphabet, along with digraphs to represent certain sounds that either do not occur in Demotic Greek, or that do not commonly occur in combination with the same sounds as they do in Tsakonian. For example, the [ʃ] sound, which does not occur in standard Greek, does occur in Tsakonian, and is spelled \"σχ\" (much like German \"sch\"). Another sound recalls Czech \"ř\". Thanasis Costakis invented an orthography using dots, \"spiritus asper\", and caron for use in his works, which has been used in his grammar and several other works. This is more like the Czech usage of hačeks (such as \"š\"). Lastly, unpalatalized \"n\" and \"l\" before a front vowel can be written double, to contrast with a palatalised single letter. (e.g. in Southern Tsakonian \"ένι\" [eɲi] \"he is\", \"έννι\" [eni] \"I am\" – the latter corresponding to Northern Tsakonian \"έμι\" [emi] and Standard Greek \"είμαι\" [ime].)\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8561907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8561907", "title": "W00t", "text": "W00t\n\nThe term w00t (spelled with double-zero, \"00\"), or woot, is a slang interjection used to express happiness or excitement, usually over the Internet. The expression is most popular on forums, USENET posts, multiplayer computer games (especially first person shooters), IRC chats, and instant messages, though use in webpages of the World Wide Web is by no means uncommon. The \"w00t\" spelling (with double-zero \"00\") is a leetspeak variant of \"woot\"; alternative spellings include \"whoot\", \"wOOt\", \"wh00t\", \"wewt\", \"wought\", etc.\n\nSee the Wiktionary article \"w00t\" for details of etymology and citations; while origins are never certain, the below is supported by contemporary written references, and is credited by American lexicographer Grant Barrett.\n\nThe term woot was recalled by a Canadian in the early 2000s to have been used in the 80s and 90s on an RPG BBS as a contraction of \"what a hoot\".\n\nw00t (1996) is a leetspeak form of earlier \"whoot\" (1993), which in turn was popularized by the rap song “Whoot, There It Is” (single released March 22, 1993) by group ; this is often confused with “” (single released May 7, 1993) by group Tag Team. Both these songs are in the same year, in the Miami bass genre. The terms \"whoot\" and \"whoomp\" (and the less common form “Whoops, there it is”) are standardizations of earlier oral use of hooting sounds variously rendered as \"whoo\", \"whoof\", \"woo\", \"woof\" (compare standard \"woohoo\"), notably by studio audience on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" (1989–94) and in the movie \"Pretty Woman\" (1990). The use by the “dog pound” section of\"The Arsenio Hall Show\" audience was based on a dog’s \"woof\", from chants used by football fans of the Cleveland Browns in Hall’s home town.\n\nMany folk etymologies exist, but the written record is clear: the term appears widely in popular print use only from 1993, particularly used both in dancehalls and at sporting events, and is credited to the songs. The \"w00t\" form gained popularity on the internet from 1996, especially in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).\n\nMany folk etymologies and backronyms exist, none supported by the written record: these often credit the term to games that appeared years after \"whoot\" had been popularized (1993) or \"w00t\" has appeared in common internet usage (1996).\n\nOne such incorrect etymology derives w00t as a contraction of a phrase like \"wow, loot!\", \"woo, loot!\", \"wondrous loot\", and \"Wonderful Loot\", etc. in a MMORPG when a player found large quantities of/or rare valuable items in game, or as an acronym for \"We Owned the Other Team\". These games appeared after w00t was already common. Another supposed origin is as an expression used by a cracker (see security cracking) who has just broken into a computer system, obtaining \"root\" access: \"woot, I have root!\". Some people say it was just a parody on a child with a speech defect trying to say \"loot\" and saying \"woot\" instead.\n\nOther etymologies relate it to \"hoot\" or \"toot\", as in trains in children's books, that went \"Woot! Woot!\", doing so as a statement of victory, or applauding good news. (Some people today say \"Woot! Woot!\" while making the hand-gesture of pulling a train's horn cord.) Alternatively, attempts are made to relate it to the Scots word \"hoots\", which is used in a somewhat similar manner — an exclamation signifying surprise, disbelief, or kindred reaction, though not for positive feelings (delight, joy) as w00t is. This is also along the line of some peoples use of \"W00t?\", replacing 'wot?' or 'what?' as a response to a happy surprise.\n\nThe word was featured on the list of Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year for 2007. They said, it \"reflects a new direction in the American language led by a generation raised on video games and cell phone text-messaging\".\n\nApart from the British digital sales house w00t!media the expression also made it into a URL-shortener. Garaj Mahal named their 2008 album \"w00t\".\n\nIn 2011, \"woot\" was added to the \"Concise Oxford English Dictionary\". The word is officially recognized in the dictionary without zeroes, and is instead spelled with two Os.\n"}

He developed into a prominent ideologue and advocate of Pan-Turkism during the early republican period, whose writings became widely read and who became one of the leading university professors in Istanbul.\n\nHe was born in Simbirsk, Russian Empire to a Tatar family and lived there until he and his mother emigrated to the Ottoman Empire when he was seven. He was educated in Constantinople and entered the Harbiye Mektebi (Military College) in 1895, before taking up a post in the Erkan-i Harbiye (General Staff Course), a prestigious training programme for the Ottoman military. He failed to complete this course as he was accused of belonging to a seditious movement and was exiled to Fezzan. \n\nHe escaped exile in 1899 and made his way to Paris where he began to emerge as a staunch advocate of Turkish nationalism. He returned to Russia in 1903 and began to write extensively on the topic. He garnered most attention for his 1904 work \"Üç Tarz-ı Siyaset\" (Three Policies), which was originally printed in the Cairo-based magazine \"Türk\". The work called on Turks to abandon the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire and instead to turn wholly to their Turkish identity. Initially dismissed as an extremist, his ideas began to find more favour after the Young Turk Revolution and the proclamation of the Second Constitutional Era (limited form of democracy). He was one of the co-founders of Ittifaq al-Muslimin.\n\nWith a growing feeling of nationalism in the country, he returned and founded the journal \"Türk Yurdu\", which sought to become the intellectual force behind the growth of nationalism. Differing from the regime somewhat, he defined the Turkish identity in purely ethnic terms and came to look outside the borders of the country for a kinship with other Turkic peoples. he also called for creation of a national economy and a move away from Islamic values (an area in which he clashed with Ziya Gökalp, as Akçura wanted a secular Turkey, fearing that Pan-Islamism would hinder nationalist development), meaning that he was largely sympathetic to Kemal Atatürk. \n\nHe died in Istanbul in 1935. He was laid to rest at the Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery in Istanbul.\n\n\n"}
