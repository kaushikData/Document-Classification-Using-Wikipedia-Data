{"id": "12784134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12784134", "title": "Basque verbs", "text": "Basque verbs\n\nThe verb is one of the most complex parts of Basque grammar. It is sometimes represented as a difficult challenge for learners of the language, and many Basque grammars devote most of their pages to lists or tables of verb paradigms. This article does not give a full list of verb forms; its purpose is to explain the nature and structure of the system.\n\nOne of the remarkable characteristics of the Basque verb is the fact that only a very few verbs can be conjugated synthetically (i.e. have morphological finite forms); the rest only have non-finite forms, which can enter into a wide variety of compound tense structures (consisting of a non-finite verb form combined with a finite auxiliary) and are conjugated in this way (periphrastically). For example, 'I come' is \"nator\" (a synthetic finite form), but 'I arrive' is \"iristen naiz\" (a periphrastic form, literally 'arriving I-am').\n\nSynthetically conjugated verbs like 'come' can also be conjugated periphrastically (\"etortzen naiz\"). In some such cases the synthetic/periphrastic contrast is semantic (e.g. \"nator\" and \"etortzen naiz\" are not generally interchangeable); in others the contrast is more a matter of style or register, or else of diachrony (some synthetic forms of conjugation are archaic or obsolete). A few synthetic forms occurring in twentieth-century Basque literature are even a posteriori extrapolations or back-formations of historically unattested forms, created for stylistic, poetic or puristic purposes.\n\nTraditionally Basque verbs are cited using a non-finite form conventionally referred to as the participle (although not all its uses are really participial). Other non-finite forms can be derived from the participle, as will be seen in a later section. When the verb possesses synthetic finite forms, these are based on an ultimate stem (called the \"basic stem\" here) which is normally also present in the participle. For example, the verb \"etorri\" 'come' has the basic stem \"-tor-\" from which are derived both the participle \"etorri\" (with the non-finite prefix \"e-\" and the participle suffix \"-i\") and the finite present stem \"-ator-\" and non-present stem \"-etor-\".\n\nThe participle is generally obtained from the basic stem by prefixing \"e-\" or \"i-\" (there is no rule; if the stem begins with a vowel, \"j-\" is prefixed instead), and suffixing \"-i\" (to stems ending in a consonant) or \"-n\" (to stems ending in a vowel). Occasionally there is no suffix. The verbal noun stem, another non-finite form, is obtained by replacing the suffixes \"-i\" and \"-n\" (and also \"-tu\" or \"-du\", see below) of the participle by either \"-tze\" or \"-te\". A third non-finite form which we shall call the \"short stem\" is obtained from the participle by omitting any of these suffixes except \"-n\", which is retained in the short stem in those verbs whose participle has it.\n\nA larger number of Basque verbs have no finite forms, but their non-finite forms follow the same pattern described above (they show an \"e-/i-/j-\" prefix, and the participle ends in \"-i\", \"-n\" or occasionally zero.\n\nThere is also another large group of verbs which again have only non-finite forms, in which the non-finite stem is unanalysable (as a verb, at least), thus there is no \"e-/i-/j-\" prefix. In most cases the participle of such verbs has the suffix \"-tu\" (\"-du\" if the stem ends in \"n\" or \"l\"). Occasionally we find zero or \"-i\" instead. This is replaced by \"-tze\" or \"-te\" in the verbal noun, and by nothing in the short stem. The stems of these \"secondary\" verbs may be (1) a nominal or other non-verbal stem (e.g. \"poz-tu, garbi-tu...\"), (2) a phrase (e.g. \"ohera-tu\"), (3) a Latin or Romance verbal stem (e.g. \"barka-tu, kanta-tu...\") or (4) an unanalysable (primary) verb stem (e.g. \"har-tu\").\n\nThe verb 'to be', the most common verb in the language, is irregular and shows some stem allomorphy in its finite forms. Its participle is \"izan\".\n\nAnother verb, \"egon\", is used in western dialects (and in writing) as a second verb 'to be' in a way similar to \"estar\" in Spanish.\n\nThe verb 'to have', also extremely common, also shows irregularities in its finite conjugation. In western and central dialects and in standard Basque, \"izan\" is used as its participle, i.e. the same participle as for 'to be'; the two meanings are disambiguated by the context. Given that Basque verbs are conventionally cited in their participle form, this presents a problem for metalinguistic terminology, because the verb \"izan\" is ambiguous.\n\nEastern dialects avoid this ambiguity by using \"ukan\" as the participle of 'to have', reserving \"izan\" for 'to be', and some grammarians employ \"izan\" and \"ukan\" in this way for convenience, but this could create confusion since most Basque speakers do not actually employ \"ukan\" (or even know it as a metalinguistic term). Other grammarians refer to 'to have' as *\"edun\", which is a hypothetical, unattested form derived from the finite stem \"-du-\"; again, the problem is that *\"edun\" does not exist in real Basque usage.\n\nTo avoid such problems, this article simply refers to \"the verb 'to be'\" and \"the verb 'to have'\".\n\nThe two standard aorist auxiliaries (see below) lack any non-finite forms, and so also have no obvious citation forms. As with *\"edun\", some grammars construct hypothetical participles based on the finite stems, referring to *\"edin\" (the intransitive aorist auxiliary) and *\"ezan\" (the transitive aorist auxiliary).\n\nThere is another verb which also means 'have', at least in western dialects, namely \"eduki\". As a lexical verb (rather than an auxiliary), many speakers and writers frequently use this verb. (This is somewhat reminiscent of, though not entirely parallel to, the Spanish distribution of \"haber\" and \"tener\".)\n\nThe verb \"esan\" ('to say') possesses finite forms which have a different stem, \"-io-\" (e.g. \"diot\" 'I say'). Some grammarians treat these as different defective verbs, while others consider them a single word with stem allomorphy.\n\nSynthetic (single-word) conjugation involves the following finite \"tenses\":\n\nFinite verbs have a basic finite stem that is either an unanalysable lexical root (e.g. \"-bil-\" 'go about, move (intr.)') or such a root preceded by the causative/intensive prefix \"-ra-\" (e.g. \"-rabil-\" 'cause to move, use'). From regular basic stems two tense stems are derived as follows: the present stem with prefix \"-a-\" and the non-present stem with prefix \"-e-\", e.g. \"-abil-\" and \"-ebil-\" are the regular present and non-present stems of \"-bil-\", \"-arabil-\" and \"-erabil-\" are the corresponding tense stems of \"-rabil-\", and so on. The present stem is used in the present tense, the present potential tense and the non-third-person imperative, e.g. present \"d-abil\" 'he/she/it goes about', present potential \"d-abil-ke\" 'he/she/it may go about', second-person imperative \"h-abil!\" 'go about!'. The non-present stem is used in the past and hypothetic tenses (non-potential and potential), and in third-person imperative forms, e.g. \"z-ebil-en\" 'he/she/it went about', \"ba-l-ebil\" 'if he/she/it went about', \"z-ebil-ke-en\" 'he/she/it might or would have gone about', \"l-ebil-ke\" 'he/she/it might or would go about', \"b-ebil!\" 'let him/her/it go about!' (not in common use).\n\nNon-present stems are further characterised by prefixes containing an \"n\" whenever the primary index (defined below) is non-third-person, e.g. \"z-ebil-en\" 'he went about' but \"n-enbil-en\" 'I went about', \"h-enbil-en\" 'you went about'; \"l-erabil-ke\" 'he would use it' but \"n-inderabil-ke\" 'he would use me'.\n\nThe suffix \"-(e)n\" is a marker of the past tenses, and \"-ke\" of the potential tenses (the past potential has both: \"-ke-en\"). The hypothetic non-potential tense usually occurs with the subordinator prefix \"ba-\" 'if', which will therefore be shown in examples; use of \"ba-\" is not restricted to the hypothetic, however (e.g. \"ba-dabil\" 'if he goes about', etc.). Apart from the tense markers mentioned, third-person prefixes distinguish between present, past, hypothetic and imperative tenses, as will be seen below.\n\nSynopses of two verbs are given in the following table as illustrations. The verb 'to be' (\"izan\") is irregular but in extremely frequent use, because it also serves as an important auxiliary. The verb \"ibili\" 'go about, move, etc.' (root \"-bil-\") is regularly conjugated, although not all its synthetic forms are in widespread use. This synoptic table shows third-person forms.\n\nAll conjugating verb stems (unless defective) can take the following set of person-indexing prefixes: \"n-\" (first-person singular), \"h-\" (second-person singular informal), \"g-\" (first-person plural), \"z-\" (second-person singular formal and second-person plural). With intransitive verbs, these prefixes index the subject; with transitives, they index the direct object. For convenience, we shall refer to this as the set of 'primary person indices'.\n\nThe following table shows some examples of how these prefixes combine with verb stems to produce a wide range of finite verb forms.\n\nThird-person verbs (here the 'person' again refers to the subject in intransitive verbs but the object in transitives) also take a prefix, which is invariable for number (singular or plural) but varies for tense, as follows: \"d-\" is used in the present tense, \"z-\" in the past, \"l-\" in the hypothetic and \"b-\" in third-person imperative forms (generally archaic or literary).\n\nSome illustrative examples follow.\n\nPlural number is marked in finite verbs in various ways, depending on the arguments whose plurality is being indexed. One set of plural forms are 'primary', that is, once again they refer to either the 'intransitive subject' or the 'transitive object' (the absolutive case agreement). The form of primary plural marking varies irregularly according to the verb stem, and may involve miscellaneous stem changes or the placement of a plural marker immediately adjacent to the singular stem (\"-z\", \"-zki\", \"-tza\", \"it-\", \"-te\"). Singular and plural forms of some finite verb stems are shown in the following table.\n\nPrimary plural marking occurs whenever the indexed argument (subject or direct object) is plural. The second-person singular polite (pronoun \"zu\") is also treated as plural for this purpose (because originally it was a second-person plural), although syntactically and semantically singular. To index the second-person plural (pronoun \"zuek\"), in addition to the markers corresponding to \"zu\" a further ('secondary') plural marker \"-te\" is suffixed.\n\n\"Note:\" The second \"-z-\" in \"zaituzte\" is not here a plural marker, but merely an epenthetic sound inserted where the sequence \"tute\" would otherwise occur; this happens in other similar cases as well, such as \"dituzte\" for *\"ditute\".\n\nThe ergative case is the case of subjects of transitive verbs. Such arguments are indexed in a different way from 'primary' arguments. Person of the ergative marker may be indexed in one of two ways: using suffixes or prefixes. The ergative-index plural marker is always a suffix (\"-te\"). The ergative person suffixes are as follows; those for the first- and second-person singular end in \"-a\" whenever another suffix morpheme follows them. The absence of an ergative suffix in transitive verbs (except those discussed in the next section) implies a third-person subject.\n\nA few sample paradigms follow.\n\nInstead of the ergative suffixes, ergative prefixes are used to index first- or second-person ergative arguments if the tense is non-present and the direct object is third person (see the gaps in the previous table). The ergative prefixes are identical to the primary prefixes in the singular, but in the plural \"-en-\" is added to the primary prefix forms:\n\nThe ergative plural suffix \"-te\" only occurs when required (a) to indicate the third person plural, or (b) to indicate the (real) second-person plural.\n\nFinite verbs that have an argument in the dative case also index the dative argument using the following set of dative suffixes (which are identical in form to the ergative suffixes except in the third person):\n\nBoth intransitive and transitive verbs may take dative indices, and the mechanism for incorporating these is the same in either case. Dative suffixes immediately follow the verb stem, preceding other suffixes such as the ergative suffixes (thus in \"d-i-da-zu\" 'you have it to me', \"-da-\" is the dative suffix and \"-zu\" is the ergative suffix) or the potential suffix \"-ke\" (as well as the past suffix \"-(e) n\", which is always word-final).\n\nOnly the primary plural marker, if present, and the dative-argument marker precede the dative suffix. The dative-argument marker, whose regular form is \"-ki-\", is added to basic verb stems to indicate that these are taking a dative argument. With \"-ki-\", the primary plural marker always takes the form of \"-z-\" immediately preceding \"-ki-\". A few verb stems have an irregular dative-argument form.\n\nThe most commonly used dative verb forms are those of the irregular verbs 'to be' and 'to have', which are in constant use as tense auxiliaries, when these verbs have no lexical meaning of their own. This is the reason why many of the glosses given below sound odd (e.g. \"dit\" 'he has it to me'); an example of a more natural-sounding use of this form as an auxiliary would be \"eman dit\" 'he has given it to me'. Nevertheless, the following table serves to clarify the morphological structure of dative-argument verb forms.\n\nIn colloquial Basque, an informal relationship and social solidarity between the speaker and a single interlocutor are expressed by employing a special mode of speech often referred to in Basque as either \"hika\" or \"hitano\" (both derived from \"hi\", the informal second-person pronoun; in other places the same phenomenon is named \"noka\" and \"toka\" for female and male interlocutors respectively). The obligatory grammatical characteristics of this mode are:\n\n\n\nThe allocutive suffixes are identical in form to the ergative and dative suffixes.\nAllocutive suffixes follow the dative suffixes, the potential \"-ke-\" and ergative third-person plural \"-te-\", and precedes other ergative suffixes (except for the synthetic forms of the verb \"esan\" with plural object). Depending on the verb in question, there may also be some other changes:\n\nEastern Basque dialects extend the allocutive system to the more polite form of address, zu (known as \"zuka\" or \"zutano\"), or the affectionate variant xu. The rules are similar. \nSuch dialects have three levels of address:\nBut most dialects lack the middle level.\n\nCompound tense forms consist of a non-finite verb form (the compound tense stem) and a finite auxiliary form. We shall begin by looking at the non-finite stems. Each verb has four: the perfect, future, imperfect and short stems. The perfect stem is identical to the participle (see above). The future stem is obtained from the participle by adding \"-ko\" (\"-go\" after \"n\"). The imperfect stem is the verbal noun (see above) plus the suffix \"-n\". The form of the short stem was discussed above. Some examples follow.\n\nBy combining the four compound tense stems with various auxiliaries, one obtains four groups of compound tense, sometimes referred to in Basque grammar as \"aspects\", which we shall call Imperfect, Perfect, Future and Aorist (= \"aspect\"-less) respectively.\n\nThe choice of auxiliary depends on the \"aspect\" and also on whether the verb is intransitive or transitive. Except in the aorist, the auxiliary for intransitives is the verb 'to be', while that for transitives is the verb 'to have'. In the Aorist a different pair of auxiliaries is used, one for intransitives and another for transitives. Since neither of the latter is used other than as an auxiliary, and neither has a participle (or other non-finite form) to provide a convenient citation form, we shall simply refer to them as the (intransitive and transitive) aorist auxiliaries.\n\nThe auxiliaries adopt all the argument indices (for subject, direct object and/or indirect object as the case may be, as well as the allocutive where applicable) that correspond to the verb within its clause.\n\nThe above diagram illustrates the patterns with auxiliaries in the present tense. However, the same auxiliaries may be used in a wide variety of tenses, not only in the present. The following two tables lay out synoptically the possible auxiliary/tense combinations for intransitive and transitive auxiliaries respectively.\n\nThe following are the most usual Basque tenses. By considering both simple and compound tenses as part of a single list, one can better see how the whole system fits together and compare the tenses with each other.\n\nSome other constructions that commonly express a range of aspectual or modal notions show a greater degree of periphrasis than those considered so far. A brief selection of some of the most important of these are shown in the following table:\n\nBasque verbs have a fairly wide range of non-finite forms. Morphologically these can all be derived via suffixation from the three non-finite forms presented at the beginning of this article: the participle, the verbal noun and the short stem. Apart from the short stem (which has a rather limited set of functions), all other forms are built on either the participle or the verbal noun.\n\nThe participle and some other non-finite forms derived therefrom are as follows. To avoid repetition, mention will not be made of the use of the participle as a perfect stem in the formation of periphrastic tenses (see above).\n\nThe verbal noun and some other non-finite forms derived therefrom are as follows. Again, to avoid repetition, mention will not be made of the use of the \"-t(z)en\" form as an imperfect stem in the formation of periphrastic tenses (see above).\n\nBasque has a fairly large number of compound verbs of a type also known as light verb constructions, consisting of two parts. The first component is a lexical element which is often (but not always) an undeclined noun. The second is a common verb which contributes less semantic content to the construction but is the part that is conjugated, thus lending to the whole its verbal character. Details of conjugation depend on the light verb used, which may be one that has synthetic finite forms (e.g. \"izan\"), or a verb without synthetic finite forms (e.g. \"egin\" or \"hartu\").\n\nIn synthetically conjugated light-verb constructions such as \"bizi naiz\" 'I live' or \"maite dut\" 'I love', care must be taken not to confuse the light verb (\"naiz, dut...\") with tense auxiliaries; \"bizi naiz\" and \"maite dut\" are simple present forms, for example. The modal verbs \"nahi izan\" and \"behar izan\" are also of this kind. In the periphrastic tenses of compound verbs with \"izan\", some contractions occur, e.g. in the future of \"bizi izan\" 'live', where we would expect \"bizi izango naiz\" for 'I will live', \"biziko naiz\" is more common, with \"-ko\" attached directly onto the lexical component \"bizi\" as if this were a verb.\n\nCompound verbs, especially those with the light verb \"egin\", offer an alternative way (besides direct derivation with \"-tu\", as seen above) for incorporating new verbs into the language, either through the incorporation of onomatopoeic words (\"kosk\" 'bite', \"oka\" 'vomit', \"hurrup\" 'sip' or 'slurp', \"klik\" 'click' ... ) or of loanwords (\"dantza\" 'dance', \"salto\" 'jump' etc.) as lexical components.\n\nA small set of modal particles, including \"al\", \"ote\" and \"omen\" only occur immediately preceding finite forms (i.e. in front of a synthetic finite form or the synthetic part of an auxiliary verb).\n\nThe only exception is that \"ote\" and \"omen\" are sometimes used in isolation where the ellipsis of a verb is understood. E.g. \"Egia ote?\" 'I wonder if it's true' is easily recognised by speakers to be an ellipsis of \"Egia ote da?\" Or if someone says \"Badator\" 'She's coming.' and someone else responds \"Omen!\" 'Supposedly!', this is as much as to say that the first utterance should incorporate \"omen\", i.e. \"Ba omen dator\" 'Supposedly she is coming.'\n\nAnother set of preverbal particles consists of the affirmative particle \"ba-\" (by modern convention joined to a following finite verb form) and the negator \"ez\". These are compatible with the modal particles, which they precede (e.g. \"ba omen dator\" in the preceding paragraph; \"ez al dakizu?\" 'don't you know?', etc.); apart from this, they too immediately precede the finite verb form.\n\nThe forms of verbs cited throughout the general presentation of the finite verb system are normally those that occur in main clauses. (However, certain forms, such as the non-potential hypothetic, e.g. \"-litz\", or the subjunctive, e.g. \"etor dadi-\", never occur in such main-clause forms and these are therefore cited in subordinate forms such as \"balitz\", \"etor dadin\" etc.)\n\nIn subordinate clauses, the finite verb takes a subordinator affix, i.e. a suffix or prefix which establishes (to some extent) the kind of subordination. Basically there are four such affixes, two suffixes and two prefixes, and one (and only one) of these is found in every subordinate form.\n\nBoth of the suffixes, however, may take further suffixes (mostly nominal declension suffixes) which serve to further specify the type of subordination. The following table provides a brief overview of some of the main uses and forms.\n\n"}
{"id": "2738447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2738447", "title": "Boom vang", "text": "Boom vang\n\nA boom vang (US) or kicking strap (UK) is a line or piston system on a sailboat used to exert downward force on the boom and thus control the shape of the sail.\nThe Collins English Dictionary defines it as \"A rope or tackle extended from the boom of a fore-and-aft mainsail to a deck fitting of a vessel when running, in order to keep the boom from riding up\".\n\nThe vang typically runs from the base of the mast to a point about a third of the way out the boom. Due to the great force necessary to change the height of the boom while a boat is under sail, a line-based boom vang usually includes some sort of a pulley system. Hydraulic piston vangs are used on larger sailboats and controlled by manual or electric hydraulic pumps.\n\nThe term kicking strap is normally shortened to \"kicker\" whilst sailing, e.g. \"Hard on the kicker when we get to the leeward mark\".\n\nOn some sailing boats, such as the 49er, rather than a set of lines pulling the boom downwards, a rigid member is used to push the boom down. \nBy controlling leech tension, the boom vang is one of the three methods of controlling sail twist.\n\nOn small sailboats and some cruising sailboats a vang may be omitted. If a vang is not installed, then the sheet has to try to control both horizontal and vertical angles of the boom. When the boom is near the centerline, the sheet is nearly vertical, and can exert downward force on the boom. As the sheet is loosened to increase the horizontal angle of the boom and sail, the sheet becomes horizontal and exerts less downward force. A vang works with the sheet to apply the downward force on the boom at all horizontal angles, allowing the sheet to be used to control the horizontal angle of the boom effectively.\n\nWhile under sail, the opposite force to the vang is supplied by the sail itself. When the sail is furled, a topping lift supplies the upward force on the boom. Some line vang systems incorporate a piston to provide the topping lift force and to damp oscillations. Hydraulic vangs can inherently act in the topping lift role.\n\nA gnav (the word \"vang\" spelt backwards) is an inverted vang. It is a rigid strut that extends obliquely upward from the boom to the mast, exerting a force that pushes down on the boom. As the fixing point of the gnav on the boom is hauled inwards towards the mast, the downward force on the boom increases. A gnav offers more uncluttered space beneath the boom when compared to a vang.\n"}
{"id": "337871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337871", "title": "Butte", "text": "Butte\n\nIn geomorphology, a butte () is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller landforms than mesas, plateaus, and tablelands. The word \"butte\" comes from a French word meaning \"small hill\"; its use is prevalent in the Western United States, including the southwest where \"mesa\" is used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.\n\nThe Mitten Buttes of Monument Valley in Arizona are two of the most distinctive and widely recognized buttes. Monument Valley and the Mittens provided backgrounds in scenes from many western-themed films, including seven movies directed by John Ford. The Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming is a laccolithic butte composed of igneous rock rather than sandstone, limestone or other sedimentary rocks.\n\nThree other notable formations that are either named \"butte\" or may be considered buttes even though they do not conform to the formal geographer's rule are Scotts Bluff in Nebraska which is actually a collection of five bluffs, Crested Butte which is a mountain in Colorado, and Elephant Butte which is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico.\n\nAmong the well-known non-flat-topped buttes in the United States are Bear Butte, South Dakota, Black Butte, Oregon, and the Sutter Buttes in California. In many cases, buttes have been given other names that do not use the word \"butte\", for example, Courthouse Rock, Nebraska. Also, some large hills that are technically not buttes have names using the word \"butte\", examples of which are Kamiak Butte and Chelan Butte in Washington state.\n\nButtes form by weathering and erosion when hard caprock overlies a layer of less resistant rock that is eventually worn away. The harder rock on top of the butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less resistant rock below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the scree or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms hoodoos.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2564884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2564884", "title": "Careening", "text": "Careening\n\nCareening (also known as \"heaving down\") is the practice of grounding a sailing vessel at high tide in order to expose one side of its hull for maintenance and repairs below the water line when the tide goes out. \n\nThe process could be assisted by securing a top halyard to a fixed object such as a tree or rock to pull the mast over as far as possible. Maintenance might include repairing damage caused by dry rot or cannon shot, tarring the exterior to reduce leakage, or removing biofouling organisms such as barnacles to increase the ship's speed. \nOne exotic method was the ancient practice of beaching a ship on a shingle beach with the goal of using wave action and the shingle to scour the hull or side of the ship.\n\nA beach favoured for careening was called a careenage. Today, only small vessels are careened, while large vessels are placed in dry dock. \nA related practice was a Parliamentary heel, in which the vessel was heeled over in deep water by shifting weight, such as ballast or guns, to one side. In this way the upper sides could be cleaned or repaired with minimal delay. Famously, HMS \"Royal George\" was lost while undergoing a Parliamentary heel in 1782. \nPirates would often careen their ships because they had no access to drydocks. A secluded bay would suffice for necessary repairs or hull cleaning, and such little “safe havens” could be found throughout the islands in the Caribbean and nearly around the world. One group of islands, Tres Marias, became popular after Francis Drake had sailed there in 1579, and they quickly became a popular place for piracy.\n\n"}

The key result states that the capacity of the channel, as defined above, is given by the maximum of the mutual information between the input and output of the channel, where the maximization is with respect to the input distribution. \n\nThe notion of channel capacity has been central to the development of modern wireline and wireless communication systems, with the advent of novel error correction coding mechanisms that have resulted in achieving performance very close to the limits promised by channel capacity. \n\nThe basic mathematical model for a communication system is the following:\n\nwhere:\n\nLet formula_2 and formula_5 be modeled as random variables. Furthermore, let formula_16 be the conditional probability distribution function of formula_5 given formula_2, which is an inherent fixed property of the communication channel. Then the choice of the marginal distribution formula_19 completely determines the joint distribution formula_20 due to the identity\n\nwhich, in turn, induces a mutual information formula_22. The channel capacity is defined as\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over all possible choices of formula_19.\n\nIf \"G\" is an undirected graph, it can be used to define a communications channel in which the symbols are the graph vertices, and two codewords may be confused with each other if their symbols in each position are equal or adjacent. The computational complexity of finding the Shannon capacity of such a channel remains open, but it can be upper bounded by another important graph invariant, the Lovász number.\n\nThe noisy-channel coding theorem states that for any error probability ε > 0 and for any transmission rate \"R\" less than the channel capacity \"C\", there is an encoding and decoding scheme transmitting data at rate \"R\" whose error probability is less than ε, for a sufficiently large block length. Also, for any rate greater than the channel capacity, the probability of error at the receiver goes to 0.5 as the block length goes to infinity.\n\nAn application of the channel capacity concept to an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with \"B\" Hz bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio \"S/N\" is the Shannon–Hartley theorem:\n\n\"C\" is measured in bits per second if the logarithm is taken in base 2, or nats per second if the natural logarithm is used, assuming \"B\" is in hertz; the signal and noise powers \"S\" and \"N\" are measured in watts or volts, so the signal-to-noise ratio here is expressed as a power ratio, \"not\" in decibels (dB); since figures are often cited in dB, a conversion may be needed. For example, 30 dB is a power ratio of formula_26.\n\nThis section focuses on the single-antenna, point-to-point scenario. For channel capacity in systems with multiple antennas, see the article on MIMO.\n\nIf the average received power is formula_27 [W] and the noise power spectral density is formula_28 [W/Hz], the AWGN channel capacity is\n\nwhere formula_30 is the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This result is known as the Shannon–Hartley theorem.\n\nWhen the SNR is large (SNR » 0 dB), the capacity formula_31 is logarithmic in power and approximately linear in bandwidth. This is called the \"bandwidth-limited regime\".\n\nWhen the SNR is small (SNR « 0 dB), the capacity formula_32 is linear in power but insensitive to bandwidth. This is called the \"power-limited regime\".\n\nThe bandwidth-limited regime and power-limited regime are illustrated in the figure.\n\nThe capacity of the frequency-selective channel is given by so-called water filling power allocation,\n\nwhere formula_34 and formula_35 is the gain of subchannel formula_4, with formula_37 chosen to meet the power constraint.\n\nIn a slow-fading channel, where the coherence time is greater than the latency requirement, there is no definite capacity as the maximum rate of reliable communications supported by the channel, formula_38, depends on the random channel gain formula_39, which is unknown to the transmitter. If the transmitter encodes data at rate formula_40 [bits/s/Hz], there is a non-zero probability that the decoding error probability cannot be made arbitrarily small,\n\nin which case the system is said to be in outage. With a non-zero probability that the channel is in deep fade, the capacity of the slow-fading channel in strict sense is zero. However, it is possible to determine the largest value of formula_40 such that the outage probability formula_43 is less than formula_44. This value is known as the formula_44-outage capacity.\n\nIn a fast-fading channel, where the latency requirement is greater than the coherence time and the codeword length spans many coherence periods, one can average over many independent channel fades by coding over a large number of coherence time intervals. Thus, it is possible to achieve a reliable rate of communication of formula_46 [bits/s/Hz] and it is meaningful to speak of this value as the capacity of the fast-fading channel.\n\n\n\n"}

For sites that thrive on thousands of click-throughs to content, many authors see the use of clickbait as a means to tap into human psyche by crafting these eye-catching headlines.\n\nBy 2014, the ubiquity of clickbait on the web had begun to lead to a backlash against its use. Satirical newspaper \"The Onion\" launched a new website, ClickHole, that parodied clickbait websites such as Upworthy and BuzzFeed, and in August 2014, Facebook announced that it was taking technical measures to reduce the impact of clickbait on its social network, using, among other cues, the time spent by the user on visiting the linked page as a way of distinguishing clickbait from other types of content. Ad blockers and a general fall in advertising clicks also affected the clickbait model, as websites moved towards sponsored advertising and native advertising where the content of the article was more important than the click-rate.\n\nSocial media groups, such as Stop Clickbait, combat clickbait by giving a short summary of the clickbait article, closing the \"curiosity gap\".\n\nClickbait has also been used to political ends, and in this respect has been blamed for the rise of post-truth politics. Katherine Viner, editor-in-chief at \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity\" undermined the value of journalism and truth. Emotional subjects with stark headlines are widely shared and clicked, which resulted in what \"Slate\" described as an \"aggregation of outrage\" and a proliferation of websites across the political spectrum – including \"Breitbart News\", \"Huffington Post\", \"Salon\", \"Townhall\" and the Gawker Media blogs – which profited by producing shareable short-form pieces offering simple moral judgements on political and cultural issues.\n\n"}
{"id": "2076709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076709", "title": "Concrete slab", "text": "Concrete slab\n\nA concrete slab is a common structural element of modern buildings. Horizontal slabs of steel reinforced concrete, typically between 4 and 20 inches (100 and 500 millimeters) thick, are most often used to construct floors and ceilings, while thinner slabs are also used for exterior paving. Sometimes these thinner slabs, ranging from to thick, are called \"mud slabs\", particularly when used under the main floor slabs or in crawl spaces.\n\nIn many domestic and industrial buildings a thick concrete slab, supported on foundations or directly on the subsoil, is used to construct the ground floor of a building. These can either be \"ground-bearing\" or \"suspended\" slabs. The slab is \"ground-bearing\" if it rests directly on the foundation, otherwise the slab is \"suspended\". \nFor double-storey or multi-storey buildings, the use of a few common types of concrete suspended slabs are used (for more types refer to the Concrete Slab#Design section below): \n\nOn the technical drawings, reinforced concrete slabs are often abbreviated to \"r.c.c.slab\" or simply \"r.c.\". Technical drawings are often created by structural engineers who use software such as AutoCad or Revit structure.\n\nThere are two main thermal considerations. The first is the question of insulating a floor slab. In older buildings, concrete slabs cast directly on the ground can drain heat from a room. In modern construction, concrete slabs are usually cast above a layer of insulation such as expanded polystyrene, and the slab may contain underfloor heating pipes. However, there are still uses for a slab that is not insulated, typically in outbuildings which are not heated or cooled to room temperature. In those cases, casting the slab directly onto a rocky substrate will maintain the slab at or near the temperature of the substrate throughout the year, and can prevent both freezing and overheating.\n\nThe second consideration is the high thermal mass, which applies to walls and floors, or wherever the concrete is used within the thermal envelope. It is a disadvantage where the rooms are heated intermittently and require a quick response, as the concrete takes time to warm up, causing a delay in warming the building. But it is an advantage in climates with large daily temperature swings, where the slab acts as a regulator, keeping the building cool by day and warm by night.\n\nA common type of insulated slab is the beam and block system (referenced above) which is modified by replacing concrete blocks with expanded polystyrene blocks. This inter-change not only allows for better insulation but assist with a lightweight slab which has a positive effect on load bearing walls and foundations.\nFor a suspended slab, there are a number of designs to improve the strength-to-weight ratio. In all cases the top surface remains flat, and the underside is modulated:\n\nReinforcement design\nLong direction = ly\nShort direction = lx\n\nOne way slab IF ly/lx > 2\n\n\nTwo way slab IF ly/lx < 2\n\nA concrete slab may be prefabricated or on site. Prefabricated concrete slabs are built in a factory and transported to the site, ready to be lowered into place between steel or concrete beams. They may be pre-stressed (in the factory), post-stressed (on site), or unstressed. It is vital that the wall supporting structure is built to the correct dimensions, or the slabs may not fit.\n\nIn-situ concrete slabs are built on the building site using formwork - a type of boxing into which the wet concrete is poured. If the slab is to be reinforced, the rebars, or metal bars, are positioned within the formwork before the concrete is poured in. Plastic-tipped metal, or plastic bar chairs, are used to hold the rebar away from the bottom and sides of the form-work, so that when the concrete sets it completely envelops the reinforcement. For a \"ground slab\", the form-work may consist only of sidewalls pushed into the ground. For a \"suspended slab\", the form-work is shaped like a tray, often supported by a temporary scaffold until the concrete sets.\n\nThe formwork is commonly built from wooden planks and boards, plastic, or steel. On commercial building sites today, plastic and steel are more common as they save labour. On low-budget sites, for instance when laying a concrete garden path, wooden planks are very common. After the concrete has set the wood may be removed, or left there permanently.\n\nIn some cases formwork is not necessary - for instance, a ground slab surrounded by brick or block foundation walls, where the walls act as the sides of the tray and hardcore acts as the base.\n\n"}
{"id": "276513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276513", "title": "Definitive stamp", "text": "Definitive stamp\n\nA definitive stamp is a postage stamp that is part of the regular issue of a country's stamps, available for sale by the post office for an extended period of time and designed to serve the everyday postal needs of the country. The term is used in contrast to a \"provisional stamp\", one that is issued for a temporary period until regular stamps are available, or a \"commemorative stamp\", a stamp \"issued to honor a person or mark a special event\" available only for a limited time. Commonly, a definitive issue or series includes stamps in a range of denominations sufficient to cover current postal rates. An \"issue\" generally means a set that is put on sale all at the same time, while a \"series\" is spread out over several years, but the terms are not precise. Additional stamps in a series may be produced as needed by changes in postal rates but some values may be permanently available, regardless of prevailing rates, for instance 1c or 1p and $1 or £1.\n\nThe range of values varies by era and country, but the focus is on coverage; the values should be sufficient to make up all possible charges using as few stamps as possible. Generally the smallest value will be the smallest unit of currency, or smallest fractional postal rate; for instance, the 1925 regular issue of the United States included a 1/2-cent stamp because some rates were expressed in fractions of a cent per ounce. The highest value of the series is generally quite large, typically from 50-100 times the normal letter rate; typical values include one pound, five dollars, etc. Not often seen by the average person, they are most common for parcels.\n\nThe in-between values are usually chosen to \"make change\" efficiently, for instance 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 in a decimal currency. It is common to include all values between 1 and 10, multiples of 5 from 10 to 50, and multiples of 10 from 50 to 100. Additional \"oddball\" values may reflect specific common rates, and if the series lasts for a period of time, there may be a number of such unusual values as in the UK QE II Machin series below.\n\nDefinitives are the workhorse stamps of a country, and as such, they tend to be small, with designs reflecting local culture and history. The definitives of poorer countries will often be very plain and cheaply printed, unlike the large and decorative commemoratives, which are almost pure profit if bought by foreign collectors and never used for postage.\nSince postal administrations know that many stamp collectors want to own every stamp of a definitive series, and a complete series can be quite expensive, there is always the temptation by governmental bureaucrats to make extra money by frequently issuing new definitive sets, as well as including stamps with very high face values in a set. Collectors' organizations have recommended that administrations only bring out new definitive issues no more often than every five years, and most administrations of the world follow this policy. An exception would be the death of a monarch, or other prominent leader, necessitating a new definitive series for the new ruler. Sometimes merely the portrait is changed, and the outer design (known as the frame) remains the same throughout several issues. Countries that ignore frequency of issue guidelines and issue volumes of stamps that have little to no practical usage produce what many collectors refer to as \"wallpaper\".\n\nSince definitive series are issued over a period of time and are reprinted to meet postal demand, they often contain more variation than is typically found in stamps that have a single print run. Switching printing methods and experimenting with phosphors is a common source of variation in modern stamps, while differences in watermarks and perforation are also prevalent, especially in older stamps. Many philatelists study these differences as part of their hobby and try to collect all the varieties of each stamp. Some varieties are particularly rare and can be more valuable than others of the same stamp that may look the same to the casual observer. One notable example of this variation is the Machin stamps of the UK, where philatelists have identified over 1000 varieties of the same basic design.\n\nSpecial stamps, such as the Christmas stamps issued annually by various countries, are sometimes regarded as definitives because they are not commemoratives, but they typically only include a limited range of denominations relating specifically to the mail seen on the occasion for which they are issued.\n\n\n"}

This is distinct from a phenotype, which is any observable characteristic or trait of a disease, such as morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that patients with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.\n\nOne example is asthma, which is considered to be a syndrome, consisting of a series of endotypes. This is related to the concept of disease entity.\n\nThe main concept in nosology is the disease entity. Normally there are two ways to define a disease entity: Manifestational criteria and causal criteria.\n\n\nFollowing Fred Gifford, these criteria lead one to view any disease entity in three different forms:\n\n\nFollowing again F. Gifford, in fact each of the previous definitions can include the aetiology or can be aetiologically agnostic. Other authors simply continue with the classification of Whitbeck, leaving just three kinds of definition (clinical, pathological and aetiological).\n\nIt is important to note that a real-world definition is normally an hybrid between these above kinds, and an endotype should use all three of the descriptors - including aetiology - to ensure specificity.\n\n"}

An ethnolect may be a distinguishing mark of social identity, both within the group and for outsiders. The term combines the concepts of an ethnic group and dialect.\n\nThe term was first used to describe the monolingual English of descendants of European immigrants in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe idea of an ethnolect relates to linguistic variation and to ethnic identity. According to Joshua Fishman, a sociologist of language, the processes of language standardization and nationalism in modern societies make links between language and ethnicity salient to users.\nEthnicity can affect linguistic variation in ways that reflect a social dimension of language usage. The way in which ethnic groups interact with one another shapes their usage of language. Dialects may be defined by phonological, syntactic, and lexical variation. Such linguistic difference may be as important as social markers for a particular ethnic group.\n\nSome twenty-first century linguists object to broader application of the term \"ethnolect\" to describe linguistic differences that are believed to reflect ethnic group affiliation. According to these scholars, this may inaccurately posit ethnicity as the central explanation for linguistic difference, when in fact there may be other variables which are more influential to an individual's speech.\n\nSome scholars also point out that the common use of \"ethnolect\" is used to compare the \"ethnolects\" of ethnic minorities with the \"standard\" speech of ethnic majorities, which is designated as the regional dialect instead of as a majority ethnolect. \n\n"}
{"id": "1002486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1002486", "title": "Fanny Adams", "text": "Fanny Adams\n\nFanny Adams (30 April 1859 – 24 August 1867) was a young English girl who was murdered by solicitor's clerk Frederick Baker in Alton, Hampshire on 24 August 1867. The murder itself was extraordinarily brutal and received national outcry in the United Kingdom. Fanny was murdered after being abducted by Baker and was brought into a hop garden near her home. She was brutally severed and her body cut into several pieces, with some parts never to have been found. Further investigations suggested that two small knives were used for the murder, but it was later ruled that they would have not been capable to commit the crime and that another weapon had to have been used.\n\nThe expression \"sweet Fanny Adams\", or \"sweet FA\", refers to her and has come, through British naval slang, to mean \"nothing at all\" or \"fuck all\", because of the initials \"FA\".\n\nFanny Adams (born 30 April 1859) and her family lived in Tanhouse Lane, situated in the northern side of Alton, a market town in Hampshire. The 1861 census shows that Fanny lived with her father, George Adams, along with his wife, Harriet, and their five children. At this time a George Adams and his wife Ann, believed to have been Fanny's grandparents, lived next door. The younger George Adams, originally a labourer,had married Harriet Mills in 1850 and soon had children: the eldest, Ellen (born 1852), followed by two sons, George (born 1853) and Walter (1856). Fanny was born on 30 April 1859 and baptised on 31 July that same year. Later followed Elizabeth (known as Lizzie) in 1862 and Lily Ada in 1866. The Adams' final child, Minnie, was born in 1871.\n\nFanny was described as being a \"tall, comely and intelligent girl\". She appeared older than her real age of eight and was known locally for her lively and cheerful disposition. Fanny's best friend, Minnie Warner, was the same age and lived next door but one in Tanhouse Lane. The town of Alton was renowned for its plentiful supply of hops, which led to many breweries opening in the town and made hop picking an integral part of its economy until the mid 20th century. To the northern end of Tanhouse Lane lies Flood Meadows and surrounding the River Wey, which sometimes flooded the area in times of heavy rain. A large hop garden was located next to the meadows.\n\nThe small market town of Alton had previously seen little crime during the 19th century. The afternoon of 24 August 1867 was reported as fine, sunny and hot. It was around this time that Fanny, along with her sister Lizzie and best friend Minnie Warner, asked Harriet Adams if she could go out to the nearby Flood Meadows. Having no objections and being pleased for the girls to leave her while she was getting on with housework, Harriet agreed. Fanny and the local children had often played in Flood Meadows, owing to its close proximity to Tanhouse Lane and the fact that there had been no real crime in Alton within living memory. As the girls were walking towards Flood Meadows and into a hop garden they met Frederick Baker, a 29-year-old solicitor's clerk. He was wearing a frock coat, light-coloured trousers and a tall hat on his head. Baker had moved to work and live in Alton about two months prior, which allegedly made him unfamiliar with the town.\n\nBaker gave Minnie and Lizzie three halfpence to spend on sweets and Fanny another halfpenny. The girls had seen Baker before at church meetings and were thus unconcerned to take money from him. Baker then watched the girls run up and down The Hollow (a lane leading to the nearby village of Shalden) as they played and ate the blackberries he had picked for them. An hour later, Lizzie and Minnie decided that they had had enough and opted to go home. Baker then approached Fanny and asked her to accompany him to Shalden. Fanny refused, and it was then Baker picked her up and carried her into the nearby hop garden.\n\nLizzie and Minnie ran back to Tanhouse Lane and went straight to Martha Warner, who ignored them and so the girls carried on playing together, oblivious of Fanny's abduction. It was not until 5 pm that they made their way home for dinner. Mrs Gardner, who also lived in Tanhouse Lane, noticed Fanny's absence and asked the girls her whereabouts. The children relayed what had occurred earlier in the day and told Mrs Gardner that Fanny had accompanied the man. Mrs Gardner then relayed the information to Fanny's mother and the two set off to search for her. They met with Baker after going only a short distance, near a gate separating the hop garden from Flood Meadows. According to the \"Hampshire Chronicle\", Mrs Gardner asked Baker what he had done with the child. But Baker assured her that he often gave money to children for buying sweets. Mrs Gardner replied \"I have a great mind to give you in charge of the police\", to which Baker told her she could do what she liked. Baker's position in town as the solicitor's clerk initially deflected any suspicions the two women had. Both returned to their homes believing Fanny was still playing in one of the surrounding fields.\n\nSometime between 7:00 and 8:00 pm, Fanny had still not returned home, prompting Harriet Adams and a group of neighbours to search for her missing child. As the evening was setting the group began the search in The Hollow, to no success. In the nearby hop garden, however, labourer Thomas Gates (a Crimean War veteran who partook in the famous Charge of the Light Brigade) found the head of Fanny Adams stuck on two hop poles while he was tending to the crops. An ear had been severed from the head which had two large cuts, from mouth to ear across the temple. Further investigation discovered the remains of the child; the head, arms and legs were separated from the trunk. There were three incisions on the left side of the chest, and a deep cut on the left arm, dividing her muscles. Fanny's forearm was cut off at the elbow joint, and her left leg nearly severed off at the hip joint with her left foot cut off at the ankle point. Her right leg was torn from the trunk, and the whole contents of her pelvis and chest completely removed. Five further incisions had been made on the liver, the heart cut out, and vagina missing. Both of her eyes were cut out and found in the nearby River Wey.\n\nDistressed, Harriet Adams rushed to her husband who was playing cricket at the time to tell him of the news, however she collapsed before she reached him and word was sent instead. When George Adams was told the details he returned home to take his loaded shotgun and set out to look for the culprit, but neighbours stopped him and instead sat with him through the night. The next day hundreds of people visited the hop garden to collect Fanny's scattered remains. The police tried unsuccessfully to find the murder weapons, as they suspected that small knives were used to commit the crime. It is likely that the crowd of searching people had inadvertently trampled down any clues left on the ground. Members of the crowd did, however, recover all of her cut clothes scattered around the field, with the exception of her hat.\n\nMost of her body parts were collected on that day but an arm, foot, and intestines were not found until the next morning. One foot was still in a shoe and the breast bone was never found. The remains of Fanny were collected together by searchers and taken to a house named Leathern Bottle to be sewn together, only yards away from her home. From there the police took them to the local police station. A stone which still had flesh and hair sticking to it was handed in to the police as evidence, as they thought it may have been the actual murder weapon.\n\nThat evening police superintendent William Cheyney hurried from the local police station to Flood Meadows, where he was met by several people who then led him to the Leathern Bottle. Upon arrival the proprietor of the house handed Cheyney a bundle labelled \"portions of a child\", and with the help of some of his officers, organised a search to trace the missing body parts. Hearing that Frederick Baker had been seen with the children prior to Fanny's disappearance, Cheyney retraced his steps through the town and located his place of work. Arriving at the solicitor's office at 9 pm, he found Baker still at work although he usually left an hour before. Baker protested innocence despite being informed that he was the only suspect. After making further enquiries around town, Cheyney had no alternative but to arrest Baker on suspicion of murder. By this time a large and agitated crowd had gathered outside the solicitor's offices, forcing the police to smuggle Baker out of the back door for fears that people would kill him.\n\nWhen searched at the police station, Baker was found to be in the possession of two unstained small knives. Spots of blood were observed on both wristbands of his shirt, and his trousers had been soaked to conceal the bloodstains. After being questioned about his appearance, Baker responded: \"Well, I don't see a scratch or cut on my hands to account for the blood\". Baker's conduct during his interrogation was described as cool and collected. Some time after the arrest, Cheyney backtracked to Baker's desk in the solicitor's office and discovered a diary among some legal papers. An entry had been made for Saturday 24th August 1867 which recorded: \"Killed a young girl. It was fine and hot\". The \"Hampshire Chronicle\" reported that the hop garden had been cleared on 21 September, but nothing connected with the murder had been found. It also added that Baker remained completely unfazed with the murder and did not exhibit any symptoms of insanity. Further confusion was added when Baker retorted that he was intoxicated after seeing the children, but all evidence and witnesses reject his claim. Baker was transferred to Winchester Prison on 19 October.\n\nFollowing investigations from Hampshire Constabulary continued until October. It was around this time when a young boy whose parents lived close to the Adams family came forward as an eyewitness. The boy testified that he saw Baker emerge from the hop garden at about 2 pm on the day Fanny was murdered, with his hands and clothes saturated with blood. Baker was then to have reportedly stooped down to the river and calmly wipe himself with a handkerchief, after which he put a small knife and another unidentified weapon in his jacket pockets. The boy had related this story to his mother at the time but she had not told anyone until she spoke out in a pub two months later. The police searched the whole area for sixteen days but no other weapons were found.\n\nSuperintendent Cheyney requested an immediate forensic test in late October. All recovered clothes and the two knives were taken from Baker and sent to Professor A.S. Taylor at Guy's Hospital in London, where they received the most detailed tests possible at the time. After examining them over the coming weeks, Taylor was able to confirm that the blood on the knives was from a human. One of the small knives contained a small amount of coagulated blood although none was on the handle. Under cross-examination Taylor stated he would have expected more blood on the knives and signs of rust if they had been washed, but the quantity of blood found was surprisingly small. However, Taylor opined that an inexperienced person armed with a proper weapon could dismember a body in about half an hour — blood would still run but would not have spurted from the body. Further examination of Baker's clothes uncovered some small experiences of diluted blood in some parts of his waistcoat, trousers and stockings. The wristbands of his shirt hand been folded back and diluted blood stained the folds. There was no sign of sexual intercourse with the body.\n\nDoctor Lewis Leslie from Alton thought the ultimate cause of death was probably by a blow to the head with a stone. Leslie speculated that a larger instrument had to have been used to cut the body, and also added that dismemberment was achieved in less than an hour. Forensics indicated that cuts had been made when the body was still warm, and that Fanny had not only been cut but also hacked and torn to pieces. The time it had taken Baker to cut the body into so many pieces most likely gave him the opportunity to choose his positioning so that he might not necessarily be covered in blood. The forensic staff in London concluded that the small knives found in Baker's possession would not have been capable of severing Fanny's body, so another weapon had to have been used.\n\nMeanwhile, in Winchester Prison, Baker was said to be talkative to the wardens and especially the chaplain. He still insisted that his conscience was clear as to the murder and wondered who the guilty party was, hoping that \"he would be found\". He ate and slept well which was in contrast to his time in Alton's prison, where he was reportedly disturbed in his sleep and physically shuddered at the sight of meat.\n\nBritish law at the time required that in the case of sudden death an immediate inquest must be held under the jurisdiction of a coroner. In the case of Fanny Adams' inquest, Deputy County Coroner Robert Harfield was in charge of the proceedings which were held at the Dukes Head Inn in Alton on 27 August 1867. Alton's divisional police superintendent William Cheyney was in attendance along with acting Chief Constable superintendent Everitt, who was representing Hampshire Constabulary. Coincidentally, the pub where the initial trials were held was opposite the solicitor's offices where Baker worked and very close to the police station.\n\nThe first to give evidence was Minnie Warner. She told the jury that Fredrick Baker gave her money to run down The Hollow with Fanny and into a nearby field while Baker picked blackberries for them. She was unable to identify Baker but correctly described what he was wearing when he murdered Fanny. The next to testify was Fanny's mother, Harriet. She recalled that she met Baker at the gate to the hop garden, and that he was headed towards the road which led to Basingstoke. It was there Minnie identified Baker as the man who gave her the pennies. Baker contradicted Minnie at the time by saying \"no, three halfpence\". When asked by Harriet to give his name, Baker refused but told her where he could be found.\n\nMrs Gardner, who had accompanied Harriet Adams to search for the missing girl, gave evidence next. She was able to identify Baker and told the jury that he appeared to be very relaxed at the time she saw him. After asking him if he had seen the missing child and enquiring why he had given her money, Mrs Gardner told Harriet that she should \"give him in charge to the police\", to which Baker calmly responded: \"the reason why I speak so is that an old gentlemen has been giving halfpence to the children for no good purpose, and I thought you were of the same sort\". After being asked again of Fanny's whereabouts, Baker said that he left her at the gate to play. The coroner asked Baker if he wanted to cross-question the witness, but he declined.\n\nAt his trial on 5 December, the defence contested Minnie Warner's identification of Baker and claimed the knives found were too small for the crime anyway. They also argued insanity: Baker's father had been violent, a cousin had been in asylums, his sister had died of a brain fever and he himself had attempted suicide after a love affair. The defence also argued that the diary entry was typical of the \"epileptic or formal way of entry\" that the defendant used and that the absence of a comma after the word killed did not render the entry a confession.\n\nJustice Mellor invited the jury to consider a verdict of not responsible by reason of insanity, but they returned a guilty verdict after just fifteen minutes. On 24 December, Christmas Eve, Baker was hanged outside Winchester Gaol. The crime had become notorious and a crowd of 5,000 attended the execution. Before his death, Baker wrote to the Adamses expressing his sorrow for what he had done \"in an unguarded hour\" and seeking their forgiveness.\n\nFanny was buried in Alton cemetery. The headstone, erected by voluntary subscription, reads:\n\nIn 1869 new rations of tinned mutton were introduced for British seamen. They were unimpressed by it, and suggested it might be the butchered remains of Fanny Adams. \"Fanny Adams\" became slang for mutton or stew and then for anything worthless – from which comes the current use of \"sweet Fanny Adams\" (or just \"sweet F.A.\") to mean \"nothing at all\". It can be seen as a euphemism for \"fuck all\" – which means the same. The large tins the mutton was delivered in were reused as mess tins. Mess tins or cooking pots are still known as Fannys.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This initiative has been adopted in countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Australia, and has been tentatively linked to higher gender equality.\n\nLinguistic activism and feminist authorship stemming from second wave feminism in the 1960s and 70s began to draw attention to gender bias in language, including \"the uncovering of the gendered nature of many linguistic rules and norms\". Scholarship such as Dennis Baron's \"Grammar and Gender\" and Anne Bodine's \"Androcentrism in Prescriptive Grammar\" uncovered historical male regulation to promote male-centric language such as the use of \"he\" as a generic pronoun.\n\nExposition and analysis of sexism in language through a grassroots feminist linguistics movement continued throughout the 80's and 90's, including study across languages and speech communities such as Germany and France. Study and documentation of gendered language has since spread to cover over 30 languages.\n\nFeminist language planning has more recently been instituted centrally in countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Australia, with mixed results.\n\nSweden have made strides towards shifting their language to fit a less misogynistic society. In the Swedish language, there has never been a word for the female genitalia or even a translation of the word “vagina”, even though the word \"snopp\" translates to “penis” and has been used as such since the 1960s. Through history, there have been many slang terms used for the woman’s genitalia, including words such as \"fitta\" translated to “cunt”, \"där nere\" translated to “down-there”, and even \"mus\" translated to “mouse”. In the 1990s, Swedish media started to bring the absence of such a word to light. It wasn’t until the early 2000s did the feminists and activists start using the word \"snippa\" to be identified with the female genitalia. \"Snippa\"’s origins can be traced back to many different Swedish dialects. It’s popular definition “refers to something small and/or narrow, for example a small pike or a narrow boat”. In regards to genitalia, “it might have been used to refer to female genitalia of cows and pigs in the early twentieth century”. Since the popularization of using the word \"Snippa,\" the Swedish Academy added the word to the 2006 Swedish Language Dictionary.\n\nSome language reformers directly work with identifying and changing sexist undertones and patriarchal vocabulary through a method called “linguistic disruption”. An example: In the United States, the word “herstory” became popularized “to refer to history which is not only about men”. Sweden has also showed efforts in language planning regarding changing misogynistic undertones in their vocabulary. The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education has promoted the word \"slidkrans\" to replace the word for “hymen”, \"mödomshinna.\" “The new word, \"slidkrans\", is made up of the two parts \"slid\", translating to “vaginal” and \"krans\", translating to “garland”. It lacks the connotations of the ideology of virginity and honour attached to mödomshinna.”\n\nAdditionally, Sweden has also shown efforts in accepting more of a non-gender binary identity by creating the gender-neutral pronoun \"hen,\" which has been used by feminists and the LGBT community. Feminist language reform regarding gender is not of recent efforts. Early feminist language reformists have been fighting the male-dominant approach to language and raising awareness to the public about the gendered structure of the society’s language.\n\nAustralia has been identified as a nation that officially promotes the feminist influence to its public bureaucracy by implementing feminist language reform across many institutions. Since this planned social shift, Australia has seen changes in political and government leadership that aim to interfere with this reform, such as a shift towards a conservative-leaning government. There are shifts that come from such movements that support them as well, such as the gender-neutral pronoun “they” being more widely accepted.\n\nThe ongoing feminist movement acknowledges language as a “powerful instrument of patriarchy”. The goals set for linguistic reform aim to achieve linguistic equality of the sexes. A study of Australian newspapers from 1992 and 1996 found that the word “chairman” was used to describe all people holding the position, including women. This is an example of a linguistic issue that feminist’s seek to reform. Occupational nomenclature reflects gender bias when “professional nomenclature used in employment-related contexts displays bias in favour of men leading to women’s invisibility in this area.” The invisibility of women is a linguistic feminist issue because when encountering sentences predominantly using male pronouns, listeners are more likely to think of men before women and therefore women get overlooked. Positions are gendered to be male and the “continuing, frequent use reflects the fact that far more men than women continue to occupy this position.” This study further investigated and found instances of female professionals being specified as women while men would just be titled with the profession itself, for example “female judge,” “woman engineer,” and “woman politician.”\n\nSwitzerland has attempted to implement feminist language reform both formally and informally. However, changes in Switzerland have proven to be complicated due to the fact that Switzerland is a multilingual country (with the major languages being German, French, and Italian). The Bulletin Suisse de Linguistique Appliquée (Swiss Bulletin of Applied Linguistics) addressed this issue in 2000 when it created a special issue dedicated to the feminization of language in Switzerland. The bulletin attempted to critique language in Switzerland by creating a composite image of all the languages in Switzerland and how they interact with gender.\n\nThe most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is German. German is a gendered language. This has concerned some language activists due to the fact that many important societal position such as judge and professor possess the gender of male and are often referred to as he/him. Activists worry that the gendering of those words discourage women from entering those fields. This facet of the German language is particularly important in Switzerland because it was historically used as a justification to restrict women’s right to vote and pass the bar.\n\nVarious attempts to implement feminist language reform have been undertaken in German speaking Switzerland. The government and other organizations have attempted to implement language feminization in the realms of policy making, teaching, advertising, etc. Language feminization refers to when in writing or talking traditional male words are feminized by either using the feminine variant of the word or adding a feminine suffix. However, these attempts have had only limited success. For example, private Swiss radio and television broadcasts still generally use the generic-masculine form of words.\n\nThe second most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is French which is also a gendered language. The French language raises similar concerns to that of the German language. This is because many nouns (especially those of professions) are gendered. To address these concerns, the Swiss government has created a guide on the non-sexist use of the French language. However, these attempts at change have been met with little success. This is due to the fact that Switzerland has limited influence over the French language. Meanwhile, France and specifically the government backed Académie Française (French Academy) (the French council for matters relating to the French language) has resisted feminist language reform.\n\nThe main focus of Feminist Language Reform is to acknowledge the often unconscious ways that language both silences and emphasizes gender in negative ways. In some languages it is clear with gendered nouns how some words are gendered to associate those words with maleness of femaleness. Feminist Philosophers argue that English, a non gendered language, still has the need for Language Reform.\n\nPrevious language reform attempts to avoid sexist words or phrases were addressed in a symptomatic manner. Often in the workplace, employees were given pamphlets with lists of words to avoid or preferred words to use. Many modern day feminists argue that this is ineffective because it does not address the root of the problem or make the large scale changes to the language that they feel are necessary.\n\nA major part of the theory focuses on when words or phrases make one gender, typically women, subjugated or invisible compared to the other. The most popular examples are the pronoun “he” or the word “man”. Feminist Language Philosophers argue that these words participate in making women invisible by having them being used to refer to men and also women. The fact that the pronouns or words for the male gender can be also used to refer to the female gender shows how maleness is dominant and femaleness is subjugated.\n\nFeminist Language Theory also focuses on when words or phrases emphasize a break in gender norms. Clear examples of this are words like Lady Doctor or Manageress. These are positions of power that are typically held by men. Therefore, when a woman holds them, they need a new title to emphasize their break of social norm. It also goes both ways, with terms like male nurse referring to a man in a typically feminine role. Feminist Language Reform seeks to remove words like this because they help to sustain unhealthy gender norms.\n\nSome modern feminists, like Sergio Bolaños Cuellar, argue that feminist language reforms needs to reverse the generic masculine forms and create a generic feminine form with words like he or man being replaced with she or woman.\n\nCases of feminist language planning have taken a largely sociolinguistic approach in which the goal is to enact social change through the reform of language and language use. This approach to language planning is divided into four stages:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2570216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2570216", "title": "Fly system", "text": "Fly system\n\nA fly system, or theatrical rigging system, is a system of rope lines, blocks (pulleys), counterweights and related devices within a theater that enables a stage crew to fly (hoist) quickly, quietly and safely components such as curtains, lights, scenery, stage effects and, sometimes, people. Systems are typically designed to fly components between clear view of the audience and out of view, into the large opening, known as the fly loft, above the stage.\n\nFly systems are often used in conjunction with other theatre systems, such as scenery wagons, stage lifts and stage turntables, to physically manipulate the mise en scène.\n\nTheatrical rigging is most prevalent in proscenium theatres with stage houses designed specifically to handle the significant dead and live loads associated with fly systems. Building, occupational safety, and fire codes limit the types and quantity of rigging permitted in a theatre based on stage configuration. Theatrical rigging standards are developed and maintained by organizations such as USITT and ESTA (now PLASA).\n\nThe line set is the fundamental machine of a typical fly system.\n\nThe function of a typical line set is to fly (raise and lower) a slender beam (typically a steel pipe) known as a batten (or a bar in the UK) by hoisting it with lift lines (typically synthetic rope or steel cable). By hanging scenery, lighting, or other equipment to a batten, they in turn may also be flown. A batten is said to be \"flying in\" when it is being lowered toward the stage, and \"flying out\" when it is being raised into the fly space. Battens may be just a few feet in length or may extend from one wing (side) of the stage to the other. A batten is suspended from above by at least two lift lines, but long battens may require six or more lift lines.\n\nIn manual rigging, a line set’s lift lines support weights opposite their connections to the batten in order to balance the weight of the batten and whatever it carries. The lift lines are reeved through a series of pulleys, known as blocks, that are mounted above the stage to fly loft structure. An operating line (a.k.a. hand line or purchase line) allows riggers on the fly crew to raise and lower the batten.\n\nAutomated rigging sometimes uses weights to help balance line set loads in a manner similar to manual counterweight rigging. Otherwise it relies solely on the motor power of an electric hoist to fly a line set.\n\nTogether, a series of parallel line sets regularly spaced up and down stage, commonly at , , or centers, comprise the bulk of most fly systems. Theatrical rigging systems are made up of hemp, counterweight and/or automated line sets able to serve various functions.\n\nLine sets are typically general purpose in function, meaning they can perform any number of functions which vary depending upon the requirements of a particular theatre production. For example, a general purpose line set can usually be quickly transformed into a drapery or scenery line set, but converting a general purpose line set into an electrical line set is more involved.\n\nWhen a line set has a predetermined, relatively permanent, function it is known as a dedicated line set. Line set functions include:\n\nLine sets often suspend theater drapes and stage curtains such as travelers, teasers (a.k.a. borders), legs, cycs, scrims and tabs, as well as associated tracks, in order to mask and frame the stage and provide backdrops. Line sets are sometimes dedicated to particular draperies, such as the main (grand) curtain and main border (valance) that mask the proscenium opening, but drapery locations can often vary.\n\nIn many stage productions, theatrical scenery is mounted to line sets in order to be flown in and out so as to quickly change set pieces during the course of a performance. For example, painted soft and hard flats (e.g., muslin drops) and are commonly used to depict settings. Also, three-dimensional sets (e.g., box sets) may be flown.\n\nElectrical line sets, commonly called electrics, are used to suspend and control lighting instruments and, in many cases, microphones and special effects equipment as well. Electrics may be temporarily \"wired\" with drop boxes (electrical boxes with outlets) or multicable fanouts dropped from the grid or draped from a fly gallery, or permanently wired with connector strips (specialized electrical raceways).\n\nThere are normally at least three electrical line sets provided above the stage, with one just upstage of the proscenium wall, one mid-stage, and one just downstage of the cyclorama. Additional electrics are typically desirable.\n\nPermanently wired electrical line sets are known as dedicated electrics, fixed electrics or house electrics. In addition to providing dimmed and switched outlets for lighting fixtures, connector strips may provide low-voltage controls (e.g., via DMX512 and Ethernet taps), for moving lights and effects, as well as microphone jacks. Power is fed to fixed electrics from terminal boxes at the grid deck via multicable. Single and double-purchase cable cradles mounted to lift lines can be used to drape the multicable, prolonging its lifespan and reducing the likelihood of conflict with adjacent line sets or lighting instruments. Pantographs are also used to drape the multicable feeding dedicated electric line sets.\n\nDedicated electrics typically employ truss battens (pipe over pipe) to facilitate cable snaking and to maximize lighting positions. In large professional theatres, such as the Philadelphia Academy of Music, an electric may take the form of a flying bridge (catwalk) that provides a walkable platform for electrician access to fixtures and effects. Flying bridges may also be used for followspot positions.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the ceiling panels, clouds, of an orchestra shell to be flown. Larger, multi-use theaters that must frequently convert the stage from a drama theatre to a concert hall often make use of the fly system in this way. Before being flown the cloud is pivoted to a vertical orientation to minimize the space it requires for storage in the fly loft.\n\nA less common use for the fly system is the use of a focus chair system. This is a system where a small chair with fall protection equipment is suspended from a track that runs the length of a batten to which it is mounted. An electrician sits on the chair, and is flown out to the height of the electrics, to focus lighting instruments.\n\nFlying rigs are used to fly scenery or performers in a more elaborate fashion than typical line sets. A flying rig typically allows horizontal as well as vertical movement by paying out individual lift lines to varying lengths and/or through the use of tracks. Flying rigs usually involve specialized equipment and techniques operated by a relatively experienced crew. Peter Foy is known for his innovations in manual flying rigs, especially those used in theatrical productions of Peter Pan. Automated flying rigs, which synchronize multiple point hoists, are becoming more common as motor control systems become safer and more sophisticated.\n\nA permanently installed fire curtain line set, though not used for productions, is a typical element of a theatrical rigging system installation. Building and fire codes typically require that either a fire curtain or water deluge system be installed to separate an audience from the stage in the event of a fire.\n\nFly systems are broadly categorized as manual or automated (motorized). Manual fly systems are more specifically categorized as \"hemp\" (a.k.a. rope line) or \"counterweight\" systems.\n\n\"Hemp houses\" (a reference to the manila hemp once most commonly used to make the ropes) exclusively use the centuries-old tradition of ropes, pulleys and sandbags to fly theatrical scenery in and out. Hemp rigging incorporates many nautical rigging techniques and equipment (e.g., block and tackle), and stems directly from that tradition. Counterweight rigging evolved from hemp rigging and generally handles scenery in a more controlled fashion.\n\nCounterweight rigging replaces the hemp rope and sandbags of rope line (hemp) rigging with wire rope (steel cable) and metal counterweights, respectively. Those substitutions permit the flying of greater loads with a high degree of control, but with a loss of flexibility inherent to most hemp systems. Flexibility is lost because most components of a hemp system may be repositioned, while counterweight system components are relatively fixed. Old \"hemp houses\" lacked counterweight rigging, but today most manual rigging houses use a combination of counterweight rigging and, at least some, hemp rigging. For example, theaters that incorporate built-in, grid-based counterweight fly systems often will also support additional, spot hemp system line sets for spot-rigging (to spot something, in theatre jargon, simply means to (re)position something).\n\nManual rigging is also possible with hand (and drill-operable) hoists (winches), but relatively limited operating speeds preclude their use for most running applications.\n\nAutomated systems are becoming more prominent. They have the potential advantages of relatively high precision, speed and ease of control, but tend to be significantly more expensive than manual systems. Hoists of various types (e.g., line shaft, chain motor, etc.) are used. A conventional counterweight system may be automated by the incorporation of a motor and controls, in what is commonly called a motor-assist system. By using counterweight in such a manner, motor sizes can be kept relatively small.\n\nThe use of a particular type of fly system in a theater usually does not preclude the use of other rigging methods in the same theater.\n\nA hemp fly system, so named for the manila hemp rope that was once common in theatrical rigging, is the oldest type of fly system, certainly the simplest type of system. Recent research shows that the hemp system, although known for centuries, was not much used. The hemp system gained popularity first in the United States in the mid nineteenth century. It soon gained popularity in England, as it was inexpensive and provided a great deal of flexibility for moving scenery. Hemp systems are also known as rope line systems, or simply as rope systems.\n\nStage rigging techniques draw largely from ship rigging. That origin is most obvious with hemp rigging, which uses closely related technology and terminology. To this day, the stage is referred to as a deck in the manner of a ship's deck. Other expressions and technology that overlap the nautical and theatrical rigging worlds include: batten, belay, block, bo'sun, cleat, clew, crew, hitch, lanyard, pinrail, purchase, trapeze, and trim.\n\nIn a typical hemp system, a \"line set\" consists of multiple hemp lines running from a batten above the stage up to the grid, through loft blocks to a headblock and then down to the fly floor where they are tied off in a group to a belaying pin on the pin rail. The lift lines and hand (operating) lines are one and the same. Typically, a lift line runs from the sand bag (counterweight) assigned to a specific line set, up to \"a single loft block\" above the fly floor and back down to the fly floor. A trim clamp (a.k.a. knuckle-buster) or a \"Sunday\" (a circle of wire rope) is used to attach this sandbag to the \"line set\" to balance the load placed on the batten. The sandbags are usually filled to weigh the same as the loads, making the two weights (the weight of the batten and the weight of the bag) equal. This arrangement assures greater safety. When the flyman wishes to fly a batten (scenery or lights) \"In\" (i.e., to the floor), the flyman pulls down on the lift line thereby raising the sandbag off the fly floor and the batten descends. When the flyman wishes to fly the batten \"Out\", he pulls down on the line set (leaving it tied off) and the batten flies out as the sand bag descends to the flyfloor. This arrangement allows the flyman to control the speed of ascent and/or descent and provides greater safety for people on the stage below. The proper \"Out\" position for the batten is set when the sand bag reaches the fly floor in its descent (adjustable) and the proper \"In\" position for the batten is established when the line set (previously tied off to the pin rail) is fully extended (adjustable). This makes it unnecessary to \"spike\" or \"mark\" either the line set or the lift line. (An \"unbalanced working line set\" should never be allowed to exist over the stage.)\n\nAnother hand line, known as a jack line, may be used to lift the sandbags if they are heavier than the batten load. (UNSAFE condition) The jack line, which runs up to a loft block and back down to the trim clamp, is tied off to a belaying pin adjacent to the one used for the line sets lift lines, either at the same, or a secondary, pin rail.\n\nPulling on the hand lines of a hemp set flies a line set out. Pulling on the jack line flies a line set in.\n\nHemp systems can be easily configured for spot rigging, where lift lines must be frequently relocated. They are much less expensive and easier to install than counterweight fly systems, though somewhat more difficult to operate.\n\nFirst introduced in Austria in 1888, counterweight rigging systems are the most common fly systems in performing arts facilities today.\n\nIn a typical counterweight fly system, an arbor (carriage) is employed to balance the weight of the batten and attached loads to be flown above the stage. The arbor, which carries a variable number of metal counterweights, moves up and down vertical tracks alongside an offstage wall. In some lower-capacity fly systems, cable guide wires are used instead of tracks to guide the arbors and limit their horizontal play during vertical travel (movement).\n\nThe top of the arbor is permanently suspended by several wire rope lift lines, made of galvanized steel aircraft cable (GAC). The lift lines run from the top of the arbor up to the top of the fly tower, around the head block, across the stage to evenly spaced loft blocks, then down, terminating at the batten, a load-bearing pipe that spans much of the width of the stage.\n\nIf the loft blocks are mounted to the grid deck, at the loft block wells, the system is called a grid-mount, or upright counterweight rigging system. If the loft blocks are mounted to roof beams (loft block beams), the system is called an under-hung counterweight rigging system. Under-hung systems have the advantages of maintaining a clear grid deck surface for spot rigging and facilitating crew movement across the grid.\n\nThe arbor's vertical position is controlled by means of a rope known as the operating line, hand line, or purchase line. The operating line forms a loop by running from the bottom of the arbor down to and around the tension block, through the rope lock, up and over the head block and back down (alongside the lift lines), where it terminates at the top of the arbor. The head and tension blocks are located above and below the full extent of the arbor's travel (movement), respectively, thereby enabling an operator to pull the operating line up or down to move the arbor. When the arbor is raised via the operating line, the lift lines slacken, which causes the batten to lower under its own weight (and the weight of its load, if any). Conversely, when the arbor is lowered, the lift lines increase in tension, which in turn causes the batten to rise.\n\nThe combined weight of the arbor and its counterweights initially matches that of the batten so that when the batten is not being raised or lowered, it will tend to remain motionless at any arbitrary elevation above the stage. As more weight is added to the batten (in the form of curtains, scenery, lighting equipment, and rigging hardware), the system is rebalanced by adding more counterweights to the arbor. When the system is properly balanced, an unassisted operator (flyman) can lift the batten and its arbitrarily heavy load from the stage (\"fly it out\", in theatrical jargon), completely above the proscenium and out of view of the house, sometimes to heights in excess of .\n\nSome large theatres, such as the Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center), have more than 100 independent, parallel counterweight line sets, while smaller venues may only have a few line sets for the most frequently adjusted loads, such as electrics.\n\nDouble purchase counterweight systems are sometimes used where the vertical travel of the counterweight arbor would be inadequate due to limited fly space or stage-level wing space. In systems of this type, the operating and lift lines are double-purchased so that the batten will travel twice the distance of the arbor. In other words, for every foot of arbor travel, the batten travels two feet. This often results in the arbors remaining well above the stage deck, leaving the otherwise occupied wing space usable for cast and crew.\n\nIn a conventional counterweight system the operating and lift lines terminate at the top of the arbor after passing over the head block. In a double-purchase system, however, after passing over the head block the operating and lift lines pass through another block, which is mounted to the top of the arbor, before rising back up and terminating below the head block. In addition, the opposite end of a double-purchase operating line terminates at the fly gallery, off-stage wall, or stage deck, instead of the underside of the arbor, after passing through a block mounted at the underside of the arbor. The additional blocks result in the arbor moving at half the rate of the lift and operating lines.\n\nIn order to compensate for the reduced arbor travel, the loaded arbors must weigh twice as much as the batten load, resulting in arbors that are twice as tall. The additional mass on the arbor increases inertia, and the additional blocks increase friction, resulting in linesets that are more difficult to operate. In addition, double-purchase linesets are more expensive to install and maintain. For those reasons, double-purchase line sets are generally avoided, or limited to a few sets within a counterweight system, unless space issues preclude the use of a single-purchase system. The use of an arbor pit is an alternative approach to dealing with limited space for arbor travel.\n\nElectrical hoists (also referred to as winches) can facilitate coordination with cues, move extremely heavy line-sets, and significantly limit the required population of the fly crew. Despite those potential benefits, most hoists can fly line sets at only a fraction of the speed that an experienced flyman can achieve manually.\n\nThere are two general categories of motorized fly systems, motor-assist and dead-haul.\n\nMotor-assist systems very closely resemble standard counterweight fly systems described above, however a drum winch, typically mounted behind the locking rail below the arbor, is used to drive a steel cable purchase line. The purchase line is still terminated at the top and bottom of the arbor, but a rope lock is not used on the motor-assist line set. Weight on the arbor helps balance the batten load so that hoist motor size can remain relatively small. It is often feasible to retrofit a standard counterweight line set to become a motor-assist set.\n\nDead-haul systems fly the entire load placed on a line set without the assistance of counterweight. Therefore, dead-haul motor sizes are relatively large.\n\nHoist (winch) motors are either fixed speed or variable speed. Fixed speed motors are used at heavy-load and/or slow-speed line sets (e.g., electrics and orchestra shell line sets). Variable speed motors are used at line sets requiring dynamic motion that may be viewed by the audience (e.g., drapery and scenery line sets). Scenery hoists commonly allow travel at rates of hundreds of feet per minute.\n\nDigital control systems incorporating computers or programmable logic controllers (PLCs) have become commonplace as well, bringing their advantages of high accuracy, safety and repeatability to fly systems.\n\nBattens are linear members to which live loads may be attached for flying. Battens were made of wood originally, but today they are typically steel pipe. Loads mounted to battens include lights, curtains and scenery so they may travel vertically, be raised up into the fly space (flown out) or lowered near to the stage floor (flown in) by its associated line set. Battens typically stretch the width of the stage, parallel with the proscenium wall, and are maintained level (parallel to the stage deck) regardless of elevation. When a batten is flown all the way out (close to the grid) it is at high trim. When it is flown all the way in (usually to about above the stage deck) it is at low trim.\n\nLoads are attached to the batten in various ways. Most lighting fixtures, for example, utilize a C-clamp to rigidly secure the light onto the batten, in conjunction with a safety cable that is looped around the batten to prevent the light from falling should the C-clamp connection fail. Non-traveling curtains (e.g., borders) often employ cloth ties, similar to shoestrings, that are hand tied onto the batten.\n\nBattens are suspended by evenly spaced lift lines, with pick points generally apart. The unsupported, cantilevered, ends of a batten, beyond the last lift line pick points, are generally no longer than unless a bridle is used to effectively limit the cantilever.\n\nBattens were originally made from wood, but have been replaced by steel pipe. In the United States they are typically fabricated from sections of nominal diameter, outside diameter, schedule 40 steel pipe that are spliced together (with internal pipe sleeves and bolts) to provide a continuous member that stretches the width of a stage. Schedule 80 pipe is also used. Standard pipe battens are typically designed to support of live load per foot of length.\n\nTruss battens, sometimes referred to as double battens, use a pipe-over-pipe arrangement (often center-to-center), with vertical struts welded between the upper and lower pipes to provide rigidity. Truss battens generally permit greater loads than single-pipe battens and may not require as many lift lines due to improved ability to span between lift lines. Truss battens are typically designed to support of live load per foot.\n\nAn electric batten, a.k.a. lighting batten, may be a single-pipe or truss batten. Electric battens typically incorporate steel straps that are used as brackets for the support of electrical equipment such as connector strips (raceways). The same straps supporting electrical equipment may also connect the two-pipe arrangement of a truss batten. The center-to-center spacing of electric truss pipe, often from , is typically greater than for a standard truss batten to allow for the proper mounting and focusing of lighting instruments. It is typical for an electric batten to support thousands of pounds of live load.\n\nLight ladder battens are a special type of electric batten oriented perpendicular to and beyond the proscenium opening, at the stage wings. They suspend light ladders (pipe frames) to which lighting fixtures may be attached. When provided, light ladder battens are usually of the truss type and may be fitted with heavy-duty track to permit repositioning of the light ladders up and down stage.\n\nTab battens are oriented perpendicular to the proscenium opening, parallel to and just off stage of light ladder battens. When provided, they are single-pipe or truss battens for the support of tab draperies, which are used to mask the stage wings.\n\nLines are the ropes, cables (wire ropes) and proof coil chains that enable a fly system to function. Steel bands are a relatively new type of line used in steel band hoists.\n\nIt is standard practice for overhead rigging lines and hardware to be rated with at least an 8-times safety factor to help ensure the protection of cast and crew. In other words, a line intended to support 100 pounds should have a safe working load of at least 800 pounds.\n\nLift lines carry and transfer the loads of a fly system to the fly system infrastructure. The lift lines for manual rigging run from the batten up to loft blocks, across the stage to a head block, and down to the counterweight balancing the load of the line set. When running horizontally, between loft blocks and head block, lift lines typically follow a transverse path (from side to side) across the stage.\n\nOperating lines, also known as hand lines or purchase lines are what the crew uses to manipulate manual fly systems. Operating lines are connected to sandbags (in a hemp system) or the top and bottom of arbors (in a counterweight system). Operating lines are typically or in diameter.\n\nLift and operating lines were commonly made of manila hemp. The rope was often referred to simply as manila. Use of manila had a number of issues. Splinters of fiber could get into hands and eyes. Humidity and temperature changes could significantly affect the length of the rope. Over time the rope slowly rots.\n\nSynthetic rope can reduce or eliminate these issues, while providing greater strength by volume. Some riggers have complained that rope burn is more likely with synthetics, and that wear and damage on a synthetic rope is harder to detect. The two most common brands of polyester rope in the theatre world are Stage-Set X (parallel-fiber core) and Multiline II (braided strand). Over time polyester rope became more popular than manila in hemp systems and for use as the operating lines in counterweight systems.\n\nThe lift lines of a counterweight rigging systems are typically a specific type of steel wire rope known as galvanized aircraft cable (GAC). Oil-free diameter, 7 x 19 strand, GAC is the most common counterweight system lift line. It has a minimum cable breaking strength of approximately .\n\nLoad-bearing lines must be safely tied off, locked, terminated and/or connected to other rigging components to ensure line control and the safety of a fly system. Various methods are employed.\n\nBelaying pins are used to belay, temporarily tie off, the rope lines of a hemp system. Each belaying pin serves as an anchor to which the loose end of a rope may be quickly secured. A standardized method is used to tie off the rope so that it is subjected to friction from itself as well as from the pin rail, thus ensuring a secure connection that is unlikely to fail. Belaying pins are typically made of hickory wood or steel.\n\nKnots, such as the clove hitch and half hitch, are used for rope line terminations. For example, hitches are used to terminate hemp lift lines at battens and operating lines at counterweight arbors.\n\nRope locks are cam-actuated devices through which a counterweight system operating line passes. The adjustable cam, or dog, inside the rope lock constricts and releases the operating line as the flyman lowers and raises a hand lever. Rope locks are mounted in series to the locking rail. A single rope lock can typically secure a static unbalanced load to . Rope locks are not intended to slow a running line.\n\nSwage (compression) fittings or cable clips are used to terminate counterweight system lift lines, after the cable has been looped around a thimble. Cable clips terminations maintain less load capacity than swage fittings, typically require three clips, and are greatly reduced in load capacity if the installer happened to \"saddle a dead horse\". Both swage and cable clip terminations permanently crimp (deform) the wire rope.\n\nTrim chains and shackles, or turnbuckles and pipe clamps, typically connect the lift lines of a line set to the batten they support. Those connections facilitate minor adjustments to, trim, the effective length of a lift line. By trimming the lift lines, loads are more evenly distributed to them. Turnbuckles are moused (secured against free rotation) to prevent the jaws from slowly unscrewing over time due to vibrations incurred during normal use.\n\nCounterweight lift lines typically connect to the tops of arbors with shackles.\n\nA block is a pulley used to support and direct lift and operating lines. A block consists of a grooved wheel, known as a sheave (pronounced \"shiv\"), steel side plates, spacers, shaft, flange bearings, mounting angles and clips, etc. Blocks are sized based on anticipated live loads, operating speeds, line type and other factors. Sheaves were traditionally fabricated of cast iron, but steel and nylon sheaves are now common.\n\nBlocks are either upright, when mounted atop a support structure, or under-hung, when mounted to the underside of a support structure.\n\nThe side plates of blocks preferably fully cover the profile of (fully enclose) the sheaves to lend the block greater stability and limit the sheave's (and crew's) potential for damage from foreign objects. Nevertheless, blocks are available with exposed sheaves.\n\nA Loft block is an overhead block that supports a single lift line. A loft block supports and redirects a lift line from the batten to the head block of a line set. Under-hung loft blocks typically mount to loft block beams (fly loft roof beams). Upright loft blocks typically mount to loft block wells (grid-level structural channels). A spot block is a readily movable loft block for mounting anywhere on the grid deck for spot rigging.\n\nThe diameter of a loft block sheave for galvanized aircraft cable is typically at least 32 times the diameter of the cable. For example, loft blocks are typically used with GAC, but blocks may be used to facilitate flying heavier line sets (e.g., electrics).\n\nLoft blocks may be equipped with idler pulleys or sag bars to limit the sag of horizontally running lift lines on under-hung systems.\n\nIn under-hung counterweight systems that use upright head blocks the series of loft blocks immediately following the head blocks are typically multi-line loft blocks instead of single-line to account for built-in vertical misalignment between head blocks and loft blocks.\n\nHead blocks are overhead multi-line blocks used for the lift lines and operating lines. Head blocks support and redirect all the lift lines from loft blocks to sand bags (of a hemp set), counterweight arbor (of a counterweight set) or hoist (of an automated line set).\n\nRope line (hemp) head blocks are typically upright blocks that mount to the rope line head block well channels at the grid level.\n\nIn a counterweight rigging system the head block sheave is grooved for both the steel cable lift lines and an operating line, with the groove for the operating line provided at the middle of the multi-grooved sheave, between the lift lines. Counterweight head blocks mount atop or at the underside of the head block beam, depending on the beam's vertical position.\n\nThe diameter of a head block sheave used for galvanized aircraft cable is typically at least 48 times the diameter of the cable. For example, head blocks are typically used with GAC, but blocks may be used to facilitate flying heavier line sets (e.g., electrics).\n\nLift lines sometimes require diversion to avoid obstacles, support non-linear loads and battens, deal with excessive fleet angles, or be reoriented from the typical transverse path across the stage (e.g., for tab and light ladder line sets). Mule blocks are single or multi-line blocks able to divert the path of those lines. Mule blocks may be permanently installed as part of counterweight rigging systems, or used for spot rigging, where they are often equipped with swivel-pivots to divert lines across a large range of angles.\n\nTension blocks are single-sheave blocks located at the lower end of the arbor guide track, beneath the arbor. The operating line is reeved through the tension block from the bottom of the arbor through the rope lock. Tension blocks typically ride vertically along the arbor guide system tracks, instead of being fixed, to allow for variation in the length of the operating line.\n\nCounterweights are heavy objects that are used to balance the lineset loads in a fly system. In hemp systems, a counterweight consists of one or more sandbags, whereas counterweight systems employ metal bricks as counterweights. The term counterweight is commonly used to refer specifically to the metal counterweight bricks.\n\nMetal counterweights are lead, cast iron, or flame-cut steel. Flame cut steel bricks are most common. In any particular fly system all counterweights typically share a common, standardized footprint that matches the system's arbors, which in turn are sized to conform to line set spacing. Counterweight systems are most often designed to use either 4 or wide weights. Weights vary in thickness, typically in half-inch increments ranging from 1/2 to , with each thickness corresponding to a different mass. thick weights are most common. Counterweights are sometimes also known as bricks or simply steel. Often a rigging worker will be asked to load a number of inches of steel, which correlates to a specific mass. Weights are usually loaded from the loading bridge, but can also be loaded from the fly gallery or stage deck in some circumstances.\n\nWhen viewed from the top, metal counterweight is basically rectangular, typically with 45-degree angle chamfers cut at two opposing corners. A slot is cut into each end of the weight so as to enable the weight to straddle, and be laterally secured by, the arbor rods. In order to facilitate removal of weights with angle cuts, it is customary to stack the weights in alternating orientations so that the square corners of any weight will be aligned with the angled corners of adjacent weights. This simplifies removal because the square corners of each weight protrude beyond the angled corners of the weight below, serving as handles that can be easily gripped, even with gloved hands.\n\nIt is customary to apply paint (typically yellow) or colored tape to the weights that counterbalance the batten (pipe) to indicate that they should not be removed from the arbor. As an additional precaution, they may be strapped in with steel strapping. When a dedicated line set carries a permanent load (e.g., main drape, orchestra cloud, etc.) the counterweight balancing the additional load may be treated in a similar fashion.\n\nA counterweight arbor is a sturdy mechanical assembly that serves as a carriage for counterweights. In its simplest form, an arbor consists of two horizontal steel plates, a top plate and bottom plate, tied together by two vertical steel connecting rods. Counterweights are stacked as required on the arbor's bottom plate to balance the line set load, with the weights held in place by the connecting rods.\n\nA flat tie bar at the rear of the arbor also connects the top and bottom plates. Guide shoes at the top and bottom of the tie bar guide the arbor along tracks mounted to the side stage wall. UHMWPE pads on the guide shoes limit friction between guide shoe and track as the arbor travels.\n\nSpreader plates are thin steel plates with holes through which the arbor connecting rods pass. Spreader plates are lowered onto the counterweights in a distributed fashion as the counterweight stack is being built. Typically one spreader plate is placed on top of every two feet of counterweight in the stack. Finally, a locking plate is lowered onto the completed, interleaved stack of counterweights and spreader plates and secured in place with a thumbscrew.\n\nSpreader plates serve to maintain consistent spacing between the arbor rods to ensure reliable containment of the counterweights under normal operating conditions. Also, in the event of a \"runaway\" (loss of control of an unbalanced lineset), the spreader plates will prevent the arbor rods from bending outward, and thus releasing the counterweights upon arbor impact at the end of its travel.\n\nA new type of arbor was introduced by Thern Stage Equipment in 2010. It is referred to as a front loading counterweight arbor. This arbor has shelves and a gate to secure the counterweights in the arbor. Spreader plates are not required with the front loading arbor. The arbor counterweights are loaded from the front, rather than from the sides.\n\nCounterweight arbors are commonly between 8 and 12 feet in length and can often support stacks of weights between 1500 and 2400 pounds, or beyond. In order to avoid unreasonably tall counterweight stacks at high capacity line sets, arbors may employ more than one counterweight stack. Such arbors use multiple-width top and bottom plates with a tie bar and pair of connecting rods provided at each counterweight stack.\n\nCounterweight rigging systems use either tracked or wire-guided arbor guide systems. The tracks or wire guides limit lateral movement of the arbors during arbor travel. Wire-guided systems have lower capacities and are not in common use.\n\nIn addition to guiding the arbors, a tracked counterweight system is provided with bump stops at arbor high and low trim that establish the limits of an arbor's travel.\n\nA tracked guide system is sometimes referred to as a T-bar wall, as the tracks are commonly made of steel T-sections. Aluminum arbor guide tracks are a relatively recent alternative, often using a J profile, instead of a T profile, to facilitate system installation.\n\nHoists of various types are used in manual automated rigging systems. The terms hoist and winch are often used interchangeably in theatre jargon. Hoists are generally assumed to be motorized unless \"manual\" is used as a descriptor.\n\nManual hoists, or hand winches, are typically composed of a drum, gear box, and crank (operating handle). A worm gear is commonly used to provide mechanical advantage as the crank is turned, which coils a single line around a smooth or helically-grooved drum. The drum line is connected to the lift lines with a clew, triangular plate with holes used for line terminations. From the clew, the lift lines run over a head block and loft blocks down to a batten. The clew may be wire-guided to limit lateral play. Drill-operable hand winches permit the handle to be removed so that an electric drill may operate the hoist.\nDrum hoists are typically composed of an electric brake motor and a multi-line helically-grooved drum. Helical drums are preferable to smooth drums for cable longevity and the precise and repeatable control of travel.\n\nDrum hoists are used for motor-assist, engaging an operating line, and dead-haul, engaging the lift lines, applications.\n\nA dead-haul drum hoist uses the single drum to support all the lift lines running from the head block of a line set. The lift lines neatly wrap and unwrap in a side-by-side arrangement on the drum as it is spun by the motor.\n\nAs a lift line coils and uncoils from the drum of a drum hoist, its fleet angle (angle of a line between drum and sheave) changes. Excessive fleet angles (e.g., greater than 1.5–2.0°) cause unpredictable line behavior and can damage lines, blocks, and drums. As a result, fleet angles limit how close a dead-haul drum hoist can be mounted to the head block (usually about 10 feet).\n\nA moving drum hoist, or traveling drum hoist, is a variation on the traditional drum hoist. Moving drum hoists effectively eliminate the fleet angle between drum and block by shifting the drum along its axis as it spins. The amount of shift per drum revolution is equal to the pitch of the drum's helical groove. With the fleet angle problem resolved, moving drum hoists can combine drum and head block into a single, relatively compact, unit for mounting to fly loft structure, with a corresponding reduction of installation cost.\n\nYo-yo, pile-up, or pilewind, hoists use yo-yo type devices instead of helically grooved drums. The yo-yos lines are coiled into overlapping layers of cable in the narrow slots. The pile-up drum hoists are usually used in low load. As the hoists are narrower than helically grooved drum hoists, these can be used in the places with limited space. Pile-up drum hoists can be mounted in many locations including ceiling, floor or wall mounting. Typical applications are to have a pile-up drum hoist with many pulleys to control a batten. Since the line is piled up on itself, this type of drum hoist provides a zero fleet angle solution.\n\n\nLine shaft hoists are typically composed of an electric brake motor, line shaft (drive shaft) and evenly spaced single-line drums aligned above the batten pick points. By placing an individual drum over each pick point, line shaft sets have the advantage, over drum sets, of eliminating the need for blocks.\n\nTo avoid lateral drift of the batten as the lift lines pay out of the grooved drums, the helical groove orientation on the drums of the line shaft may be alternated between drums to balance competing fleet angles. However the elimination of drift by this method is typically compromised by limited batten travel.\n\nLine shaft hoists can also use yo-yo type devices instead of helically grooved drums. Yo-yo hoists are typically used where lighter loads are imposed (e.g., for operating an Austrian puff curtain). Because yo-yos lines are wrapped over themselves, the velocity and travel of the lines are relatively difficult to accurately control.\n\nPoint hoists, also known as spot line winches, control a single lift line and are commonly used for automated spot rigging or flying rigs. A point hoist may operate in solitude, or in unison with other point hoists to comprise a line set.\n\nChain hoists, more commonly referred to as chain motors, are the most common form of point hoist, especially with touring musical shows (e.g., rock-and-roll shows), but are relatively slow. Chain motors can be mounted at the grid to hoist a load from above, or mounted at the load to \"climb\" towards the grid.\n\nPoint hoists using wire rope (GAC) are common, and steel band point hoists are also used. While generally more expensive than chain hoists, wire rope and steel band point hoists can operate at relatively high speeds. Wire rope spot line winches may be configured to pay out to the side (horizontally), for use in conjunction with a loft block, so that the position of the relatively heavy winch can be static and only the loft block need be spotted above the pick point.\n\nFly system infrastructure consists of the relatively permanent load-bearing and load-transferring structures of a stage house. The infrastructure, generally fabricated of structural steel members, is sized by a structural engineer during the design of a new theatre, or theatre renovation. Rigging system infrastructure ultimately limits a fly system's capacity.\n\nBuilding codes generally require that fly system beam design meets the L/360 rule: beams shall not deflect by more than the length of a span divided by 360. For example, a head block beam should not deflect more than under the system design's maximum loading condition. Beam design using the L/360 rule typically results in beams with a yield-strength significantly higher than the maximum loading condition, effectively providing a factor of safety.\n\nThe fly loft, fly tower or fly space, is the large volume above the stage into which line set battens are flown, along with whatever loads they may be carrying. In a full-size fly space, the tower height is ideally at least 2.5 times the height of the proscenium. This allows a full-height curtain or set piece to be located completely out of view of the audience without exceeding the travel distance of standard (single-purchase) counterweight arbors.\n\nThe grid deck, gridiron deck, or grid, is a permeable working surface present at the top of many fly lofts that is used to support and provide access to many of a rigging system's components. Though originally constructed of wood, down-facing three-inch steel channels with three-inch gaps became the prevalent grid decking in the 20th century. Today, large-opening heavy-duty steel bar grating is most common in new theatres. The grid deck surface is usually rated to support live loads as well as all anticipated dead-hung equipment and hemp and motorized (e.g., chain hoist) spot rigging. Its permeability facilitates the mounting of equipment and the passing of lift lines and electrical cables. Spot rigging is not feasible without a grid.\n\nThe grid deck allows access to the \"head block beam\" and \"loft block beams\" of counterweight systems. Spanning from the proscenium wall to the upstage wall, these beams support the dead and live loads of a fly system. As per their names, counterweight system head blocks and loft blocks may be directly mounted to these beams. The head block beam is situated directly above the loading gallery. The loft block beams are spaced to match the \"pick points\" of the lift lines suspending the battens. The loft block beams may also be used to suspend the grid deck support structure.\n\nRope line (hemp) head block well channels sit atop the grid deck and are used for mounting hemp system head blocks. They are situated above the pinrail(s) below.\n\nLoft block wells are ten inch gaps between pairs of face-to-face steel channels flush with the grid deck that occur beneath each loft block beam. The loft blocks of a hemp, or grid-mount counterweight, rigging system can mount to the loft block well channels. The loft block wells may also act as clear openings through which the lift lines of under-hung counterweight, or automated, systems may pass.\n\nA grid deck is indispensable in professional and touring theatres, and desirable in all theatres with a fly tower, providing invaluable access and flexibility to fly systems. However, due to height limitations, not all fly towers are equipped with a grid. Transverse catwalks are sometimes provided as compensation for the lack of a grid. San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, not burdened by height limitations, has two grid decks.\n\nSpecific to a stage house using a counterweight system, the loading bridge, or loading gallery, is a catwalk vertically positioned below the headlock beam, and above the fly gallery. The loading bridge is used to add or remove counterweights from arbors. The floor of the loading bridge is also typically used as a storage area for uncommitted counterweights that are available for loading onto counterweight arbors. Stage houses with especially tall fly towers, or double-purchase systems, may have two loading bridges, one stacked over the other to facilitate the loading of relatively tall arbors.\n\nA fly gallery is a catwalk running from the proscenium wall to upstage wall to which a pinrail and/or locking rail may be mounted used by the fly crew to operate the fly system. The fly gallery elevation is typically at about proscenium height, providing a good view of the stage and fly loft. Fly galleries may be provided stage left and right, or at just one side. Where provided at both sides of the stage they may be connected by a cross-over catwalk at the upstage wall. It is possible to load arbors (add or remove counterweights) at the fly gallery, but standard practice is to load arbors at the loading bridge. (A vertical cinematic montage from the deck to the fly gallery is a striking feature of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.)\n\nA pin rail, originally a wood beam, is typically a large-diameter round steel tube with vertical through-holes that accept belaying pins used in a hemp rigging system. Depending on the pin rail design, the pins may be removable or permanently fixed to the rail. Pin rails are typically installed permanently at the onstage edge of the fly gallery(ies), extending from the proscenium wall to upstage wall, sometimes in a stacked (rail over rail) arrangement. Mobile pin rails may also be used and are bolted down to the stage deck where needed.\n\nA locking rail is typically a steel angle or rectangular tube to which the rope locks of a counterweight system are mounted. Locking rails are located on the stage deck and/or fly gallery and typically extend from the proscenium wall to the upstage wall.\n\nA stage-level locking rail may be provided with an engaging bar for a portable capstan winch.\n\nArbor pits, where provided, are troughs at the stage edge that provide additional vertical travel to a counterweight system's arbors. Providing a counterweight arbor pit can help compensate for height limitations of a fly tower. The trough depth typically ranges from 2 to 10 feet. Shallower pits may be accessible only from above at the stage deck. Deeper pits are sometimes accessible from a trap room or orchestra pit.\nBecause fly systems involve large amounts of weight, and particularly because the weight is usually suspended above people, there are a number of common precautions taken to ensure safety and prevent injuries. Communication, inspection, and loading procedure are key to the safe operation of a fly system.\n\nExcept for during performances and some rehearsals, a standard practice in theatre is for the flyman to always call (shout) out a warning before moving a lineset so as to alert personnel (e.g., rehearsing performers and technicians) who are on the stage. People on stage typically acknowledge the operator's warning by yelling out a confirmation that the warning was heard.\n\nThe flyman's warning specifies what is moving and its direction of movement. For example, a particularly verbose call might be something like \"lineset three, first electric flying in to the deck, downstage\" (in USA) or \"Heads onstage, Bar 3, LX 1 coming in.\" (in UK). In many theaters, all people on stage are expected to respond with \"thank you.\" Upon completion of the lineset motion, some operators may call again (e.g., \"lineset three locked\") to announce that the lineset has stopped moving.\n\nUnbalanced loads are of great concern in manual rigging. Minor imbalance is sometimes desirable, for example so that as an operating line is let out a line set will fly in of its own accord. However, as it is common for many thousands of pounds of equipment and scenery to be flown above cast and crew, major imbalance is a grave hazard, and, if left unaddressed, can result in runaways.\n\nThe use of block and tackle or capstan winch is common to handle line sets that have significantly unbalanced loads. Block and tackle sets use the mechanical advantage (e.g., 6 : 1) of multi-purchase blocks to enable a crew to manually raise an imbalanced line set. The standing block is secured at the grid level and the running block to the batten or arbor (whichever is overloaded). Where an engaging bar has been designed into the stage level locking rail, a portable electric capstan winch may be used to counteract an imbalanced counterweight line set. Pulling on (constricting) a rope wrapped a few times around the capstan, a drum spinning at a constant rate, generates enough traction (through friction) to tug the imbalanced load.\n\nEspecially tall fly towers pose a balance problem for standard counterweight line sets. As a line set is lowered to the stage, the weight of the lift lines is added to the total weight of the line set that a rigger must be able to control. For example, a batten with 6 lift lines of ¼\" aircraft cable that travels 50 feet effectively weighs about 40 pounds more when flown in than when it is flown out. To address this issue, a compensating mechanism may be added to the counterweight system. Either chain or thick wire-rope may be used.\n\nOne end of a compensating chain (typically roller chain) is suspended from the underside of the counterweight arbor, the opposite end mounted to the adjacent wall, at a point corresponding to half the travel of the arbor. The compensating chain is about half the length that the arbor travels, and sized to weigh twice as much as the combined weight of the lift lines per linear foot. At arbor low trim, the compensating chain is fully supported by the wall. At arbor high trim, the chain is fully supported by the arbor. Paying out at half the speed of arbor travel, a compensating chain effectively eliminates imbalance along the full path of travel.\n\nA compensating wire rope line is attached to the top and to the underside of an arbor and runs through sheaves near those for the operating line. This wire rope line follows a similar path to the operating line. The compensating line is made of two lengths of wire rope: a thick heavy wire rope (e.g. 1\" diameter), and a thin wire rope (e.g. 1/4\" diameter). One end of each length is attached together. The free thick end of the compensating line is attached to the underside of the arbor and the free thin end is attached to the top. As fly pipe lowers and the arbor rises, more of the thick heavy wire rope hangs beneath the arbor and compensates for the additional weight of the fly lines. This mechanism works well with T-track counterweight systems.\n\nA runaway is a moving lineset that cannot be safely controlled by its operator. Runaways can occur when the weight on the arbor is not equal to the weight of the batten and its load. Linesets are often intentionally unbalanced to facilitate quick flying in one direction and, in such cases, runaways are more likely to occur.\n\nIn the rare event that an unbalanced lineset gains so much momentum that the operator cannot stop it, a specified safety procedure is usually followed. Venues typically establish a standard call for this event, which might sound something like \"Runaway 47, upstage, heads.\" Operators are trained not to attempt to stop a runaway lineset but rather to warn others and safely escape. The reason for this is that it is unlikely that they will be able to stop it, and very likely that they will burn their hands or be lifted by the lineset, potentially injuring themselves on structure above and/or from a subsequent fall. Furthermore, this might position the operator in the path of the batten, arbor, or sandbag as they accelerate downward. Spreader plates are used in counterweight arbors to keep the arbor's vertical rods from bending and releasing the counterweights in the event of a runaway, while the locking plate prevents the counterweights from bouncing out of the arbor.\n\nWhen loading a batten, or arbor in a counterweight system, it is imperative to control the balance of a set. The lineset should be balanced before loading begins, then the batten flown in, the set added, and then the counterweight added from the loading bridge. The specific order is important because it keeps the set from being unbalanced in a position where it could run away. When it is batten-heavy (after the set is added, but before the counterweights) the arbor does not have anywhere to run away to as it is already at its grid stop (the upper end of the track). In cases where the set is too tall for the batten to be all the way in, it should be kept as far down as possible. It is always best to add the load in pieces as small as practical and counterweight them one at a time so the system can never get too out of balance. Improper loading procedure is a common cause of accidents in many theaters.\n"}

{"id": "84933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84933", "title": "Kyrgyz language", "text": "Kyrgyz language\n\nKyrgyz (natively , , ' or , , ') is a Turkic language spoken by about four million people in Kyrgyzstan as well as China, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Russia. Kyrgyz is a member of the Kyrgyz–Kipchak subgroup of the Kypchak languages, and modern-day language convergence has resulted in an increasing degree of mutual intelligibility between Kyrgyz and Kazakh.\n\nKyrgyz was originally written in the Turkic runes, gradually replaced by a Perso-Arabic alphabet (in use until 1928 in USSR, still in use in China). Between 1928 and 1940 a Latin-script alphabet, the Uniform Turkic Alphabet, was used. In 1940 due to general Soviet policy, a Cyrillic alphabet eventually became common and has remained so to this day, though some Kyrgyz still use the Arabic alphabet. When Kyrgyzstan became independent following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there was a popular idea among some Kyrgyzstanis to switch to the Latin script, which is still common in some small pockets of the countryside, and make the Latin script the country’s official national script (taking in mind a version closer to the Turkish alphabet rather than the original alphabet of 1928–40). Although the plan has not yet been implemented, it remains in occasional discussion.\n\nThe first people certainly known by the name Kyrgyz are mentioned in early medieval Chinese sources as northern neighbors and sometime subjects of the Turkic steppe empire based in the area of Mongolia. The Kyrgyz people were involved in the international trade route system popularly known as the Silk Road no later than the late eighth century. By the time of the destruction of the Uighur Empire in 840 CE, they spoke a Turkic language little different from Old Turkic, and wrote it in the same runic script. After their victory over the Uyghurs the Kyrgyz did not occupy the Mongolian steppe, and their history for several centuries after this period is little known, though they are mentioned in medieval geographical works as living not far from their present location.\n\nIn the period of tsarist administration (1876–1917), the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz both were called Kyrgyz, with what are now the Kyrgyz subdenominated when necessary as Kara-Kyrgyz \"black Kyrgyz\" (alternatively known as \"The Great Kyrgyz\"). The modern Kyrgyz language did not have a standard written form until 1923, at which time an Arabic alphabet was introduced. That was changed to a Latin-script alphabet, developed by Kasym Tynystanov in 1928 and to a Cyrillic alphabet in 1940. In the years immediately following independence, another change of alphabet was discussed, but the issue does not seem to generate the same passions in Kyrgyzstan that it does in other former Soviet republics, perhaps because the Kyrgyz Cyrillic alphabet is relatively simple and is particularly well-suited to the language. Josip Broz Tito learned to speak Kyrgyz perfectly. During the long period of Russian rule, the Kyrgyz language was strongly influenced by Russian.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Akayev government pursued an aggressive policy of introducing Kyrgyz as the official language, forcing the remaining European population to use Kyrgyz in most public situations. Public pressure to enforce this change was sufficiently strong that a Russian member of President Akayev's staff created a public scandal in 1992 by threatening to resign to dramatize the pressure for \"Kyrgyzification\" of the non-native population. A 1992 law called for the conduct of all public business to be converted fully to Kyrgyz by 1997. However, in March 1996, Kyrgyzstan's parliament adopted a resolution making Russian an official language alongside Kyrgyz, marking a reversal of the earlier sentiment. Substantial pressure from Russia was a strong factor in this change, which was part of a general rapprochement with Russia urged by Akayev. Nowadays, Russian remains the main language in the main cities, such as Bishkek while Kyrgyz continues losing ground, especially among the younger generations \n\n appears only in borrowings from Persian or when followed by a front vowel later in the word (regressive assimilation), e.g. 'sloping' instead of . Note that in most dialects, its status as a vowel distinct from is questionable.\n\nThe United States Peace Corps trains its volunteers using a \"Left-Right Shift\" method when carrying-out language training in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nThe Kyrgyz in Kyrgyzstan use a Cyrillic alphabet, which uses all the Russian letters plus ң, ө, and ү.\n\nIn Xinjiang of China, an Arabic alphabet is used.\n\nAlthough the Latin script is not in official use, some Kyrgyz texts are written in the Turkish variant of the Latin alphabet which was designed by Pamukkale University, and uses Turkish spelling norms e.g. for diphthongization (\"ey\", \"ay\" etc.) and with the addition of \"J\" corresponding to Russian \"Ж\" (/zh/). Native Kyrgyz sound values are almost identical to Turkish, the exceptions being the velar nasal /ŋ/ and the voiceless uvular stop /q/ which do not exist in Turkish. In these cases they are written as \"ñ\" and \"q\" respectively.\n\nNouns in Kyrgyz take a number of case endings that change based on vowel harmony and the sort of consonant they follow (see the section on phonology).\n\nNormally the decision between the velar (, ) and uvular ( and ) pronunciation of and is based on the backness of the following vowel—i.e. back vowels imply a uvular rendering and front vowels imply a velar rendering—and the vowel in suffixes is decided based on the preceding vowel in the word. However, with the dative suffix in Kyrgyz, the vowel is decided normally, but the decision between velars and uvulars can be decided based on a contacting consonant, for example банк /bank/ 'bank' + GA yields банкка , not as predicted by the following vowel.\n\nKyrgyz has eight personal pronouns:\n\nThe declension of the pronouns is outlined in the following chart. Singular pronouns (with the exception of сиз, which used to be plural) exhibit irregularities, while plural pronouns don't. Irregular forms are highlighted in bold.\n\nIn addition to the pronouns, there are several more sets of morphemes dealing with person.\n\nVerbs are conjugated by analyzing the root verb: 1) determine weather the end letter is a vowel or consonant 2) add appropriate suffix while following vowel-harmony/shift rules.\n\nTo form complement clauses, Kyrgyz nominalises verb phrases. For example, \"I don't know what I saw\" would be rendered as \"Мен эмнени көргөнүмдү билбейм\" (\"Men emneni körgönümdü bilbeym\"): I what-ACC.DEF see-ing-1st.SG-ACC.DEF know-NEG-1st.SG, or roughly \"I don't know my having seen what,\" where the verb phrase \"I saw what\" is treated as a nominal object of the verb \"to know.\" The sentence above is also an excellent example of Kyrgyz vowel harmony; notice that all the vowel sounds are front vowels.\n\nSeveral nominalisation strategies are used depending on the temporal properties of the relativised verb phrase: -GAn(dIK) for general past tense, -AAr for future/potential unrealised events, and -A turgan(dɯq) for non-perfective events are the most common. The copula has an irregular relativised form экен(дик) which may be used equivalently to forms of the verb бол- \"be\" (болгон(дук), болоор). Relativised verb forms may, and often do, take nominal possessive endings as well as case endings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "438005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438005", "title": "New Criticism", "text": "New Criticism\n\nNew Criticism was a formalist movement in literary theory that dominated American literary criticism in the middle decades of the 20th century. It emphasized close reading, particularly of poetry, to discover how a work of literature functioned as a self-contained, self-referential aesthetic object. The movement derived its name from John Crowe Ransom's 1941 book \"The New Criticism\".\n\nThe work of Cambridge scholar I. A. Richards, especially his \"Practical Criticism\" and \"The Meaning of Meaning\", which offered what was claimed to be an empirical scientific approach, were important to the development of New Critical methodology. Also very influential were the critical essays of T. S. Eliot, such as \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\" and \"Hamlet and His Problems\", in which Eliot developed his notion of the \"objective correlative\". Eliot's evaluative judgments, such as his condemnation of Milton and Dryden, his liking for the so-called metaphysical poets and his insistence that poetry must be impersonal, greatly influenced the formation of the New Critical canon.\n\nNew Criticism developed as a reaction to the older philological and literary history schools of the US North, which, influenced by nineteenth-century German scholarship, focused on the history and meaning of individual words and their relation to foreign and ancient languages, comparative sources, and the biographical circumstances of the authors. These approaches, it was felt, tended to distract from the text and meaning of a poem and entirely neglect its aesthetic qualities in favor of teaching about external factors. On the other hand, the literary appreciation school, which limited itself to pointing out the \"beauties\" and morally elevating qualities of the text, was disparaged by the New Critics as too subjective and emotional. Condemning this as a version of Romanticism, they aimed for newer, systematic and objective method.\n\nIt was felt, especially by creative writers and by literary critics outside the academy, that the special aesthetic experience of poetry and literary language was lost in the welter of extraneous erudition and emotional effusions. Heather Dubrow notes that the prevailing focus of literary scholarship was on \"the study of ethical values and philosophical issues through literature, the tracing of literary history, and ... political criticism\". Literature was approached and literary scholarship did not focus on analysis of texts.\n\nNew Critics believed the structure and meaning of the text were intimately connected and should not be analyzed separately. In order to bring the focus of literary studies back to analysis of the texts, they aimed to exclude the reader's response, the author's intention, historical and cultural contexts, and moralistic bias from their analysis. These goals were articulated in Ransom's \"Criticism, Inc.\" and Allen Tate's \"Miss Emily and the Bibliographers\".\n\nClose reading (or \"explication de texte\") was a staple of French literary studies, but in the United States, aesthetic concerns, and the study of modern poets was the province of non-academic essayists and book reviewers rather than serious scholars. The New Criticism changed this. Though their interest in textual study initially met with resistance from older scholars, the methods of the New Critics rapidly predominated in American universities until challenged by Feminism and structuralism in the 1970s. Other schools of critical theory, including, post-structuralism, and deconstructionist theory, the New Historicism, and Receptions studies followed.\n\nAlthough the New Critics were never a formal group, an important inspiration was the teaching of John Crowe Ransom of Vanderbilt University, whose students (all Southerners), Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and Robert Penn Warren would go on to develop the aesthetics that came to be known as the New Criticism. Indeed, for Paul Lauter, a Professor of American Studies at Trinity College, New Criticism is a reemergence of the Southern Agrarians. In his essay, \"The New Criticism\", Cleanth Brooks notes that \"The New Critic, like the Snark, is a very elusive beast\", meaning that there was no clearly defined \"New Critical\" manifesto, school, or stance. Nevertheless, a number of writings outline inter-related New Critical ideas.\n\nIn 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled \"The Intentional Fallacy\", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention, or \"intended meaning\" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.\n\nIn another essay, \"The Affective Fallacy\", which served as a kind of sister essay to \"The Intentional Fallacy\" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay \"Literature in the Reader\" (1970).\n\nThe hey-day of the New Criticism in American high schools and colleges was the Cold War decades between 1950 and the mid-seventies. Brooks and Warren's \"Understanding Poetry\" and \"Understanding Fiction\" both became staples during this era.\n\nStudying a passage of prose or poetry in New Critical style required careful, exacting scrutiny of the passage itself. Formal elements such as rhyme, meter, setting, characterization, and plot were used to identify the theme of the text. In addition to the theme, the New Critics also looked for paradox, ambiguity, irony, and tension to help establish the single best and most unified interpretation of the text.\n\nAlthough the New Criticism is no longer a dominant theoretical model in American universities, some of its methods (like close reading) are still fundamental tools of literary criticism, underpinning a number of subsequent theoretic approaches to literature including poststructuralism, deconstruction theory, and reader-response theory.\n\nIt was frequently alleged that the New Criticism treated literary texts as autonomous and divorced from historical context, and that its practitioners were “uninterested in the human meaning, the social function and effect of literature.” \n\nIndicative of the reader-response school of theory, Terence Hawkes writes that the fundamental close reading technique is based on the assumption that “the subject and the object of study—the reader and the text—are stable and independent forms, rather than products of the unconscious process of signification,\" an assumption which he identifies as the \"ideology of liberal humanism,” which is attributed to the New Critics who are “accused of attempting to disguise the interests at work in their critical processes.” For Hawkes, ideally, a critic ought to be considered to “[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a ‘ready-made’ product.”\n\nIn response to critics like Hawkes, Cleanth Brooks, in his essay \"The New Criticism\" (1979), argued that the New Criticism was not diametrically opposed to the general principles of reader-response theory and that the two could complement one another. For instance, he stated, \"If some of the New Critics have preferred to stress the writing rather than the writer, so have they given less stress to the reader—to the reader's response to the work. Yet no one in his right mind could forget the reader. He is essential for 'realizing' any poem or novel. . .Reader response is certainly worth studying.\" However, Brooks tempers his praise for the reader-response theory by noting its limitations, pointing out that, \"to put meaning and valuation of a literary work at the mercy of any and every individual [reader] would reduce the study of literature to reader psychology and to the history of taste.\" \n\nAnother objection to the New Criticism is that it is thought to aim at making criticism scientific, or at least “bringing literary study to a condition rivaling that of science.” René Wellek, however, points out the erroneous nature of this criticism by noting that a number of the New Critics outlined their theoretical aesthetics in stark contrast to the \"objectivity\" of the sciences (although Ransom, in his essay \"Criticism, Inc.\" did advocate that \"criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic\").\n\nAt times, Wellek defended the New Critics in his essay “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra” (1978).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23213", "title": "Political correctness", "text": "Political correctness\n\nThe term political correctness (adjectivally: politically correct; commonly abbreviated PC) is used to describe language, policies, or measures that are intended to avoid offense or disadvantage to members of particular groups in society. Since the late 1980s, the term has come to refer to avoiding language or behavior that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting groups of people considered disadvantaged or discriminated against, especially groups defined by sex or race. In public discourse and the media, it is generally used as a pejorative, implying that these policies are excessive or unwarranted.\n\nThe contemporary pejorative usage of the term emerged from conservative criticism of the New Left in the late 20th century. This usage was popularized by a number of articles in \"The New York Times\" and other media throughout the 1990s, and was widely used in the debate about Allan Bloom's 1987 book \"The Closing of the American Mind\", and gained further currency in response to Roger Kimball's \"Tenured Radicals\" (1990), and conservative author Dinesh D'Souza's 1991 book \"Illiberal Education\", in which he condemned what he saw as liberal efforts to advance self-victimization and multiculturalism through language, affirmative action, and changes to the content of school and university curricula.\n\nCommentators on the political left contend that conservatives use the concept of political correctness to downplay and divert attention from substantively discriminatory behavior against disadvantaged groups. They also argue that the political right enforces its own forms of political correctness to suppress criticism of its favored constituencies and ideologies. In the United States the term has played a major role in the 'culture war' between liberals and conservatives.\n\nThe term \"politically correct\" was used infrequently until the latter part of the 20th century. This earlier use did not communicate the social disapproval usually implied in more recent usage. In 1793, the term \"politically correct\" appeared in a U.S. Supreme Court judgment of a political lawsuit. The term also had use in other English-speaking countries in the 1800s. William Safire states that the first recorded use of the term in the typical modern sense is by Toni Cade Bambara in the 1970 anthology \"The Black Woman\". The term probably entered use in the United Kingdom around 1975.\n\nIn the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase \"politically correct\" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, \"The New York Times\" reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits \"only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct.\"\n\nAs Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided \"correct\" positions on all political matters. According to American educator Herbert Kohl, writing about debates in New York in the late 1940s and early 1950s,\n\nIn the 1970s, the American New Left began using the term \"politically correct\". In the essay \"The Black Woman: An Anthology\" (1970), Toni Cade Bambara said that \"a man cannot be politically correct and a [male] chauvinist, too.\" Thereafter, the term was often used as self-critical satire. Debra L. Shultz said that \"throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the New Left, feminists, and progressives... used their term 'politically correct' ironically, as a guard against their own orthodoxy in social change efforts.\" \"PC\" is used in the comic book \"Merton of the Movement\", by Bobby London, which was followed by the term \"ideologically sound\", in the comic strips of Bart Dickon. In her essay \"Toward a feminist Revolution\" (1992) Ellen Willis said: \"In the early eighties, when feminists used the term 'political correctness', it was used to refer sarcastically to the anti-pornography movement's efforts to define a 'feminist sexuality'.\"\n\nStuart Hall suggests one way in which the original use of the term may have developed into the modern one:\n\nAllan Bloom's 1987 book \"The Closing of the American Mind\" heralded a debate about \"political correctness\" in American higher education in the 1980s and 1990s. Professor of English literary and cultural studies at CMU Jeffrey J. Williams wrote that the \"assault on ... political correctness that simmered through the Reagan years, gained bestsellerdom with Bloom's Closing of the American Mind.\" According to Z.F. Gamson, Bloom's book \"attacked the faculty for 'political correctness'.\" Prof. of Social Work at CSU Tony Platt says the \"campaign against 'political correctness'\" was launched by Bloom's book in 1987.\n\nAn October 1990 \"New York Times\" article by Richard Bernstein is credited with popularizing the term. At this time, the term was mainly being used within academia: \"Across the country the term p.c., as it is commonly abbreviated, is being heard more and more in debates over what should be taught at the universities\". Nexis citations in \"arcnews/curnews\" reveal only seventy total citations in articles to \"political correctness\" for 1990; but one year later, Nexis records 1532 citations, with a steady increase to more than 7000 citations by 1994. In May 1991, \"The New York Times\" had a follow-up article, according to which the term was increasingly being used in a wider public arena:\n\nThe previously obscure far-left term became common currency in the lexicon of the conservative social and political challenges against progressive teaching methods and curriculum changes in the secondary schools and universities of the U.S. Policies, behavior, and speech codes that the speaker or the writer regarded as being the imposition of a liberal orthodoxy, were described and criticized as \"politically correct\". In May 1991, at a commencement ceremony for a graduating class of the University of Michigan, then U.S. President George H.W. Bush used the term in his speech: \"The notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land. And although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudice with new ones. It declares certain topics off-limits, certain expression off-limits, even certain gestures off-limits.\"\n\nAfter 1991, its use as a pejorative phrase became widespread amongst conservatives in the US. It became a key term encapsulating conservative concerns about the left in culture and political debate more broadly, as well as in academia. Two articles on the topic in late 1990 in \"Forbes\" and \"Newsweek\" both used the term \"thought police\" in their headlines, exemplifying the tone of the new usage, but it was Dinesh D'Souza's \"Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus\" (1991) which \"captured the press's imagination.\" Similar critical terminology was used by D'Souza for a range of policies in academia around victimization, supporting multiculturalism through affirmative action, sanctions against anti-minority hate speech, and revising curricula (sometimes referred to as \"canon busting\"). These trends were at least in part a response to multiculturalism and the rise of identity politics, with movements such as feminism, gay rights movements and ethnic minority movements. That response received funding from conservative foundations and think tanks such as the John M. Olin Foundation, which funded several books such as D'Souza's.\n\nHerbert Kohl, in 1992, commented that a number of neoconservatives who promoted the use of the term \"politically correct\" in the early 1990s were former Communist Party members, and, as a result, familiar with the Marxist use of the phrase. He argued that in doing so, they intended \"to insinuate that egalitarian democratic ideas are actually authoritarian, orthodox and Communist-influenced, when they oppose the right of people to be racist, sexist, and homophobic.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s, conservative and right-wing politicians, think-tanks, and speakers adopted the phrase as a pejorative descriptor of their ideological enemies – especially in the context of the Culture Wars about language and the content of public-school curricula. Roger Kimball, in \"Tenured Radicals\", endorsed Frederick Crews's view that PC is best described as \"Left Eclecticism\", a term defined by Kimball as \"any of a wide variety of anti-establishment modes of thought from structuralism and poststructuralism, deconstruction, and Lacanian analyst to feminist, homosexual, black, and other patently political forms of criticism.\" \n\nLiberal commentators have argued that the conservatives and reactionaries who used the term did so in effort to divert political discussion away from the substantive matters of resolving societal discrimination – such as racial, social class, gender, and legal inequality – against people whom conservatives do not consider part of the social mainstream. Jan Narveson wrote that \"that phrase was born to live between scare-quotes: it suggests that the operative considerations in the area so called are \"merely\" political, steamrolling the genuine reasons of principle for which we ought to be acting...\" Commenting in 2001, one such British journalist, Polly Toynbee, said \"the phrase is an empty, right-wing smear, designed only to elevate its user\", and, in 2010, \"the phrase 'political correctness' was born as a coded cover for all who still want to say \"Paki\", \"spastic\", or \"queer\"\". Another British journalist, Will Hutton, wrote in 2001:\n\nGlenn Loury wrote in 1994 that: \"to address the subject of \"political correctness\" when power and authority within the academic community is being contested by parties on either side of that issue, is to invite scrutiny of one's arguments by would-be \"friends\" and \"enemies.\" Combatants from the left and the right will try to assess whether a writer is \"for them\" or \"against them.\"\n\nIn the US, the term has been widely used in books and journals, but in Britain, usage has been confined mainly to the popular press. Many such authors and popular-media figures, particularly on the right, have used the term to criticize what they see as bias in the media. William McGowan argues that journalists get stories wrong or ignore stories worthy of coverage, because of what McGowan perceives to be their liberal ideologies and their fear of offending minority groups. Robert Novak, in his essay \"Political Correctness Has No Place in the Newsroom\", used the term to blame newspapers for adopting language use policies that he thinks tend to excessively avoid the appearance of bias. He argued that political correctness in language not only destroys meaning but also demeans the people who are meant to be protected. Authors David Sloan and Emily Hoff claim that in the US, journalists shrug off concerns about political correctness in the newsroom, equating the political correctness criticisms with the old \"liberal media bias\" label.\n\nMuch of the modern debate on the term was sparked by conservative critiques of liberal bias in academia and education, and conservatives have used it as a major line of attack since.\nUniversity of Pennsylvania professor Alan Charles Kors and lawyer Harvey A. Silverglate connect speech codes in US universities to philosopher Herbert Marcuse. They claim that speech codes create a \"climate of repression\", arguing that they are based on \"Marcusean logic\". The speech codes, \"mandate a redefined notion of \"freedom\", based on the belief that the imposition of a moral agenda on a community is justified\", a view which, \"requires less emphasis on individual rights and more on assuring \"historically oppressed\" persons the means of achieving equal rights.\" Kors and Silverglate later established the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which campaigns against infringement of rights of due process, in particular \"speech codes\". Similarly, a common conservative criticism of higher education in the United States is that the political views of the faculty are much more liberal than the general population, and that this situation contributes to an atmosphere of political correctness.\n\nGroups who oppose certain generally accepted scientific views about evolution, second-hand tobacco smoke, AIDS, global warming, race, and other politically contentious scientific matters have used the term \"political correctness\" to describe what they view as unwarranted rejection of their perspective on these issues by a scientific community they feel is corrupted by liberal politics.\n\n\"Political correctness\" is a label typically used to describe liberal terms and actions, but not for equivalent attempts to mold language and behavior on the right. However, the term \"right-wing political correctness\" is sometimes applied by commentators, especially when drawing parallels: in 1995, one author used the term \"conservative correctness\" arguing, in relation to higher education, that \"critics of political correctness show a curious blindness when it comes to examples of conservative correctness. Most often, the case is entirely ignored or censorship of the Left is justified as a positive virtue. [...] A balanced perspective was lost, and everyone missed the fact that people on all sides were sometimes censored.\"\n\nIn 2003, French fries and French toast were renamed \"Freedom fries\" and \"Freedom toast\" in three U.S. House of Representatives cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq; this was described as \"polluting the already confused concept of political correctness.\" In 2004, then Australian Labor leader Mark Latham described conservative calls for \"civility\" in politics as \"the new political correctness.\"\n\nIn 2012, Paul Krugman wrote: \"the big threat to our discourse is right-wing political correctness, which – unlike the liberal version – has lots of power and money behind it. And the goal is very much the kind of thing Orwell tried to convey with his notion of Newspeak: to make it impossible to talk, and possibly even think, about ideas that challenge the established order.\"\n\nAfter Mike Pence was booed at a November 2016 performance of Hamilton, president-elect Trump called it harassment and asked for a \"safe and special place\". Chrissy Teigen commented that it was \"the very thing him and his supporters make fun of as liberal political correctness.\"\n\nAlex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute defined the right's own version of political correctness as “patriotic correctness”. Vox editor Dara Lind summarized the definition as \"a brand of right-wing hypersensitivity that gets just as offended by insults to American pride and patriotism (like protests against the president-elect or “The Star-Spangled Banner”) as any college activist gets over insults to diversity.\" Jim Geraghty of National Review replied to Nowrasteh, stating that \"There is no right-wing equivalent to political correctness.\"\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, leading up to the 2016 United States presidential election, Republican candidate Donald Trump used political correctness as a common target in his rhetoric. According to Trump, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were willing to let ordinary Americans suffer because their first priority was political correctness.\n\nIn \"the Huffington Post\", Eric Mink characterized Trump's concept of \"political correctness\":\n\nPolitical correctness is a controversial social force in a nation with a constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression, and it raises legitimate issues well worth discussing and debating. But that’s not what Trump is doing. He’s not a rebel speaking unpopular truths to power. He’s not standing up for honest discussions of deeply contentious issues. He’s not out there defying rules handed down by elites to control what we say. All Trump’s defying is common decency.\nFollowing the 2016 election, \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Jessica Roy wrote that \"political correctness\" is one of the key terms used by the American alt-right, who refer to it as being \"responsible for most of society's ills\".\n\nSome conservative commentators in the West argue that \"political correctness\" and multiculturalism are part of a conspiracy with the ultimate goal of undermining Judeo-Christian values. This theory, which holds that political correctness originates from the critical theory of the Frankfurt School as part of a conspiracy that its proponents call \"Cultural Marxism\", is generally known as the Frankfurt School conspiracy theory by academics. The theory originated with Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay \"New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'\", published in a Lyndon LaRouche movement journal. In 2001, conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan wrote in \"The Death of the West\" that \"political correctness is cultural Marxism\", and that \"its trademark is intolerance\".\n\nIn the United States, left forces of \"political correctness\" have been blamed for censorship, with \"Time\" citing campaigns against violence on network television as contributing to a \"mainstream culture [which] has become cautious, sanitized, scared of its own shadow\" because of \"the watchful eye of the p.c. police\", even though in John Wilson's view protests and advertiser boycotts targeting TV shows are generally organized by right-wing religious groups campaigning against violence, sex, and depictions of homosexuality on television.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, some newspapers reported that a nursery school had altered the nursery rhyme \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" to read \"Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep\" and had banned the original. But it was later reported that in fact the Parents and Children Together (PACT) nursery had the children \"turn the song into an action rhyme... They sing happy, sad, bouncing, hopping, pink, blue, black and white sheep etc.\" This story was widely circulated and later extended to suggest that other language bans applied to the terms \"black coffee\" and \"blackboard\". \"Private Eye\" magazine reported that similar stories had been published in the British press since \"The Sun\" first ran them in 1986.\n\nPolitical correctness is often satirized, for example in \"The PC Manifesto\" (1992) by Saul Jerushalmy and Rens Zbignieuw X, and \"Politically Correct Bedtime Stories\" (1994) by James Finn Garner, which presents fairy tales re-written from an exaggerated politically correct perspective. In 1994, the comedy film \"PCU\" took a look at political correctness on a college campus.\n\nOther examples include the television program \"Politically Incorrect\", George Carlin’s \"Euphemisms\" routine, and \"The Politically Correct Scrapbook\". The popularity of the \"South Park\" cartoon program led to the creation of the term \"\"South Park\" Republican\" by Andrew Sullivan, and later the book \"South Park Conservatives\" by Brian C. Anderson. In its Season 19 (2015), \"South Park\" introduced the character PC Principal, who embodies the principle, to poke fun at the principle of political correctness.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\"'s host Stephen Colbert often talked, satirically, about the \"PC Police\".\n\nGraham Good, an academic at the University of British Columbia, wrote that the term was widely used in debates on university education in Canada. Writing about a 1995 report on the Political Science department at his university, he concluded:\n\"Political correctness\" has become a popular phrase because it catches a certain kind of self-righteous and judgmental tone in some and a pervasive anxiety in others – who, fearing that they may do something wrong, adjust their facial expressions, and pause in their speech to make sure they are not doing or saying anything inappropriate. The climate this has created on campuses is at least as bad in Canada as in the United States.\n\nIn Hong Kong, as the 1997 handover drew nearer, greater control over the press was exercised by both owners and the Chinese state. This had a direct impact on news coverage of relatively sensitive political issues. The Chinese authorities exerted pressure on individual newspapers to take pro-Beijing stances on controversial issues. Tung Chee-hwa's policy advisers and senior bureaucrats increasingly linked their actions and remarks to \"political correctness.\" Zhaojia Liu and Siu-kai Lau, writing in \"The first Tung Chee-hwa administration : the first five years of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\", said that \"Hong Kong has traditionally been characterized as having freedom of speech and freedom of press, but that an unintended consequence of emphasizing political 'correctness' is to limit the space for such freedom of expression.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, controversies over PC surfaced during the 1990s regarding the social studies school curriculum.\n\n"}
{"id": "28358620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28358620", "title": "Postediting", "text": "Postediting\n\nPost-editing (or postediting) is the process whereby humans amend machine-generated translation to achieve an acceptable final product. A person who post-edits is called a post-editor. The concept of post-editing is linked to that of pre-editing. In the process of translating a text via machine translation, best results may be gained by pre-editing the source textfor example by applying the principles of controlled languageand then post-editing the machine output. It is distinct from editing, which refers to the process of improving human generated text (a process which is often known as revision in the field of translation). Post-edited text may afterwards be revised to ensure the quality of the language choices or proofread to correct simple mistakes.\n\nPost-editing involves the correction of machine translation output to ensure that it meets a level of quality negotiated in advance between the client and the post-editor. Light post-editing aims at making the output simply understandable; full post-editing at making it also stylistically appropriate. With advances in machine translation full post-editing is becoming an alternative to manual translation. Practically all computer assisted translation (CAT) tools now support post-editing of machine translated output. \n\nMachine translation left the labs to start being used for its actual purpose in the late seventies at some big institutions such as the European Commission and the Pan-American Health Organization, and then, later, at some corporations such as Caterpillar and General Motors. First studies on post-editing appeared in the eighties, linked to those implementations. To develop appropriate guidelines and training, members of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA) and the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) set a Post-editing Special Interest Group in 1999.\n\nAfter the nineties, advances in computer power and connectivity sped machine translation development and allowed for its deployment through the web browser, including as a free, useful adjunct to the main search engines (Google Translate, Bing Translator, Yahoo! Babel Fish). A wider acceptance of less than perfect machine translation was accompanied also by a wider acceptance of post-editing. With the demand for localisation of goods and services growing at a pace that could not be met by human translation, not even assisted by translation memory and other translation management technologies, industry bodies such as the Translation Automation Users Society (TAUS) expect machine translation and post-editing to play a much bigger role within the next few years.\n\nThe use of Machine Translation suggests sometimes pre-editing.\n\nStudies in the eighties distinguished between degrees of post-editing which, in the context of the European Commission Translation Service, were first defined as conventional and rapid or full and rapid. Light and full post-editing seems the wording most used today.\n\nLight post-editing implies minimal intervention by the post-editor, as strictly required to help the end user make some sense of the text; the expectation is that the client will use it for inbound purposes only, often when the text is needed urgently, or has a short time span.\n\nFull post-editing involves a greater level of intervention to achieve a degree of quality to be negotiated between client and post-editor; the expectation is that the outcome will be a text that is not only understandable but presented in some stylistically appropriate way, so it can be used for assimilation and even for dissemination, for inbound and for outbound purposes.\n\nAt the top end of full post-editing there is the expectation of a level of quality which is indistinguishable from that of human translation. The assumption, however, has been that it takes less effort for translators to work directly from the source text than to post-edit the machine generated version. With advances in machine translation, this may be changing. For some language pairs and for some tasks, and with engines that have been customised with domain specific good quality data, some clients are already requesting translators to post-edit instead of translating from scratch, in the belief that they will attain similar quality at a lower cost.\n\nThe light/full classification, developed in the nineties when machine translation still came on a CD-ROM, may not suit advances in machine translation at the light post-editing end either. For some language pairs and some tasks, particularly if the source has been pre-edited, raw machine output may be good enough for gisting purposes without requiring subsequent human intervention.\n\nPost-editing is used when raw machine translation is not good enough and human translation not required. Industry advises post-editing to be used when it can at least double the productivity of manual translation, even fourfold it in the case of light post-editing.\n\nHowever, post-editing efficiency is difficult to predict. Various studies from both academia and industry have claimed that post-editing is generally faster than translating from scratch, regardless of language pairs or translators' experience. There is, however, no agreement about \"how much\" time can be saved through post-editing in practice (if any at all): While the industry reports on time savings around 40%, some academic studies suggest that time savings under realistic working conditions are more likely to be between 15–40%. Several professionals claim that it takes longer to make correction than to translate from scratch.\n\nIt is said that efficiency can be greatly improved when translation memory technology is used in conjunction with post-editing. Translation memory stores segments of post-edited text in a bilingual central repository for future use in populating higher quality translations for the same words, sentences and phrases used in future translations. This is said to continuously increase translation productivity over time while improving translation quality by saving post-edited text for future translation projects.\n\nAfter some thirty years, post-editing is still “a nascent profession”. What the right profile of the post-editor is has not yet been fully studied. Post-editing overlaps with translating and editing, but only partially. Most think the ideal post-editor will be a translator keen to be trained on the specific skills required, but there are some who think a bilingual without a background in translation may be easier to train. Not much is known either on who the actual post-editors are, whether they tend to be professional translators, whether they work mostly as in-house employees or self-employed, and on which conditions. Many professional translators dislike post-editing, among other reasons because it tends to be paid at lower rates than conventional translations, with the International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters (IAPTI) having been particularly vocal about it.\n\nThere are not clear figures on how big the post-editing pie is within the translation industry. A recent survey showed 50% of language service providers offered it, but for 85% of them it accounted less than 10% of their throughput. Memsource, a web-based translation tool, claims over 50 percent of translations between English and Spanish, French and other languages have been done in its platform combining translation memory with machine translation. Post-editing is also being done through translation crowdsourcing portals such as Unbabel which, by November 2014 claimed to have post-edited over 11 million words.\n\nProductivity and volume estimates are, in any case, moving targets since advances in machine translation, in a significant part driven by the post-edited text being fed back into its engines, will mean the more post-editing is done, the higher the quality of machine translation and the more widespread post-editing will become.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32340310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32340310", "title": "Pular grammar", "text": "Pular grammar\n\nPular grammar is the set of structural rules that govern the Pular language, one of the Fula languages of the Niger-Congo language family spoken in West Africa. It is complicated and varies from region to region. This may explain why it is virtually impossible to find literature that teaches advanced topics in Pular Grammar. The following explanation concerns mainly the Pular language spoken in Futa Jallon. To facilitate learning, all expressions are translated into English, so this article could also be a tool for learning Pular vocabulary. Numerous examples are given in tables to demonstrate the rules provided and to allow the reader to decipher the rules of Pular grammar.\n\nSince the articles of nouns vary significantly, it is probably better to learn each Pular noun with its appropriate articles. It is also useful to learn the plural and singular forms of Pular nouns together because no simple rules are apparent for going from the singular form to the plural form. This may sound like a daunting task, but a few generalizations can be made.\n\nThe plural articles ɓen, ɗin and ɗen correspond exactly to the ɓe, ɗi and ɗe in other varieties of Fula. Pular pronunciation tends to nasalize these words, which is represented by the trailing letter \"n.\"\n\nPlease see the tables below for examples that demonstrate these systematic patterns.\n\nThe nouns of most fruits and vegetables follow a similar pattern when changing from singular to plural. These nouns have a root form, which perhaps was imported from other languages. The singular form of these nouns is obtained by adding re to the root, and nden is usually the definitive article. By contrast, the plural form is obtained by adding je to the root, and ɗen is the definitive article for the plural form. The table below provides examples to demonstrate this pattern.\n\nNote that \"jungo\" can be used for all when it means \"responsibility\". Example: No e jungo amen = it is in our responsibility or we are in change. Men acci e jungo mon = We leave it to you.\nAlso, unlike in English, in Pular the possessive adjective comes after the noun. In the table above, \"jungo\" is a noun that means hand. Similar to English, the possessive adjective does not vary with the genre or number of what is possessed. It varies only with the noun that possesses. For example:\n\nThe singular possessive in Pular - an - corresponds exactly with the am used in other varieties of Fula. Again, the pronunciation is more nasalized in Pular.\n\nlan, ma, te, mo, men, en, on, ɓe.\nko hombo, ko honɗun, ko homɓe, ko honno, ko honto, ko ... honɗi, ko ... njelo, ko ... jelu\nmi, a, o, men, en, on, ɓe, ɗe, ɗi\n\nPular has many demonstrative adjectives, which are keywords that indicate the location of a \"noun\" with respect to the speaker. However, they are usually derived from the definitive articles described above. Here is a partial list:\n\noo, ɓee (plural = these people), ɗii(plural), ɗee(plural), [ngal, ngol, ngii, ngoo, nguu, nduu, ndee, ndii, ɗan, mbaa, kun, etc...]\nThe English equivalent of these adjective demonstratives are: this, these, that, and those.\n\nNote that this is a partial list.\n\nSee the table below for some expressions using indefinite pronouns.\nɗoo, gaa, ɗaa, too, gaɗa, gaanin\n\nPular verbs - like those in other varieties of Fula (with the exception of Adamawa) - fall into one of three \"voices\": active, middle, and passive. Infinitives in Pular are formed with -gol rather than -de as in other varieties of Fula. The endings are:\n\nVerbal extensions (sometimes dubbed \"infixes\") can be added between the root and the (active) verb ending to change meaning. Examples of verb endings with this adfixes include: angol, ingol, orgol and others. Please see the table below for examples.\n1) Active voice verbs (ending in \"ugol\"): To express the affirmative form of ugol verbs in the future, simply replace the ugol ending with ay. For example, soodugol turns into sooday. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"soodugol\", which means to buy.\n\nAlthough the verb does not vary with the subject, it does vary with the object. That is when the object is the singular form of you, the \"ay\" ending becomes \"e\". The table below shows some examples of how the future form of \"ugol\" verbs varies with the object.\nVerbs with \"infixes\" (ending in \"angol\", \"ingol\" or \"orgol\", ): To express the affirmative form of these verbs in the future, simply replace the gol ending with ay. For example, jangangol turns into janganay; yaggingol into yagginay; and okkorgol into okkoray. Similar to above, the verb does not vary when the subject varies.\n\n2) Middle voice verbs (ending in \"agol\"): To express the affirmative form of agol verbs in the future, simply replace the agol ending with oto. For example, fubbagolturns into fubboto. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"fubbagol\", which means to swim.\n3) Passive voice verbs (ending in \"egol\"): To express the affirmative form of egol verbs in the future, simply replace the egol ending with ete. For example, weelegolturns into weelete. Note however that this form does not always make sense if the subject is I (mi). For example, \"mi sokete\" sounds more like \"I will have you jailed\" than \"I will be jailed\". The table below provides more examples using the verb \"weelegol\", which means to be hungry.\n\n1) Verbs ending in -ugol makes either -u 2nd pers. sing. or -en 1st pers. plur. or -ee 2nd pers. plur.\n\nokkugol: to give makes Okku : Give; Okken: Let us give and Okkee: Let you give\n\n2) Verbs ending in -agol makes either -o 2nd pers. sing. or -oɗen 1st pers. plur. or -ee 2nd pers. plur.\n\nJooɗagol: to sit makes Jooɗo gaa : Sit here ; Jooɗoɗen : Let us sit ; Jooɗee : Let you sit.\n\n3) Verbs ending in -egol do not have an imperative forms though an imperative construction is possible.\n\nRules when the verb has an infix:\n\n1)Verbs ending in \"ugol\": To express the affirmative form of ugol verbs in the \"terminated past\" form, simply replace the ugol ending with uno. For example, soodugol turns into sooduno. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"soodugol\".\n\nHere are some simple sentences where \"ugol\" verbs are conjugated in the Terminated Past form.\n\nAlthough the verb does not vary with the subject, it does vary with the object. That is when the object is either me or you(singular), the \"ugol\" verb can vary. The table below shows some examples of how the Terminated Past form of \"ugol\" verbs varies with the object. The chosen verb is \"wallugol\", which means to help.\n\n2)Verbs ending in \"agol\": To express the affirmative form of agol verbs in the \"terminated past\" form, simply replace the agol ending with ino. For example, jooɗagol turns into jooɗino. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"immgagol\", which means to get up.\n\nHere are some simple sentences where \"agol\" verbs are conjugated in the Terminated Past form.\n3)Verbs ending in \"egol\": To express the affirmative form of egol verbs in the \"terminated past\" form, simply replace the egol ending with ano. For example, lamminegol turns into lamminano. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"weelegol\", which means to be(get) hungry.\nHere are some simple sentences where \"egol\" verbs are conjugated in the Terminated Past form.\n1)Verbs ending in \"ugol\": To express the affirmative form of ugol verbs in the \"simple past\" form, simply replace the ugol ending with ii. For example, soodugol turns into soodii. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"ɲaamugol\", which means to eat.\n\nHere are some simple sentences where \"ugol\" verbs are conjugated in the Simple Past form.\n2)Verbs ending in \"agol\": To express the affirmative form of agol verbs in the \"simple past\" form, simply replace the agol ending with ike. For example, jooɗagol turns into jooɗike. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"immgagol\", which means to get up.\n\nHere are some simple sentences where \"agol\" verbs are conjugated in the Simple Past form.\n3)Verbs ending in \"egol\": To express the affirmative form of egol verbs in the \"simple past\" form, simply replace the egol ending with aama. For example, lamminegol turns into lamminaama. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"weelegol\", which means to be(get) hungry.\nHere are some simple sentences where \"egol\" verbs are conjugated in the Simple Past form.\n\n1)Verbs ending in \"ugol\": To express the affirmative form of ugol verbs in the \"past participle\" form, simply replace the ugol ending with i. For example, nawnugol turns into nawni. Note that the past participle form of the verb behaves as an adjective and is preceded by the verb to be conjugated in the present. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"ronkugol\", which means to be tired.\n\nHere are some simple sentences where \"ugol\" verbs are converted to the Past Participle form and used as adjectives.\n2)Verbs ending in \"agol\": To express the affirmative form of agol verbs in the \"simple past\" form, simply replace the agol ending with ike. For example, jooɗagol turns into jooɗike. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"immgagol\", which means to get up.\n\nHere are some simple sentences where \"agol\" verbs are conjugated in the Simple Past form.\n3)Verbs ending in \"egol\": To express the affirmative form of egol verbs in the \"simple past\" form, simply replace the egol ending with aama. For example, lamminegol turns into lamminaama. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"weelegol\", which means to be(get) hungry.\nHere are some simple sentences where \"egol\" verbs are conjugated in the Simple Past form.\n\n1)Verbs ending in \"ugol\": To express the negative form of ugol verbs in the future, simply replace the ugol ending with ataa. For example, soodugol turns into soodataa. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"soodugol\", which means to buy.\n2)Verbs ending in \"agol\": To express the negative form of agol verbs in the future, simply replace the agol ending with ataako. For example, fubbagol turns into fubbataako. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"fubbagol\", which means to swim.\n3)Verbs ending in \"egol\": To express the negative form of egol verbs in the future, simply replace the egol ending with ataake. For example, janfegol turns into fubbataake. Note that the verb does not vary with the subject. The table below provides more examples using the verb \"janfegol\", which means to be cheated.\n\nThe word \"very\" in English takes many different forms in Pular depending on what adjective is being emphasized. Here are a few examples:\nHowever, in general, most of these Pular adverbs could be replaced with moƴƴa to emphasize the adjective. But the style would be lost. The table below contains additional examples with their appropriate adverbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative clauses in Pular are often used to give more details about a noun or an idea within a sentence. Thus they play a similar role in English. They are often associated with the following relative pronouns:\n\nPlease see the table below for examples that demonstrate the use of relative clauses.\n\n"}

He was born in a Hindu family to father Hiranand and was named \"Natthu Ram\".\n\nAs a youth, Natthu Ram was apprenticed to a Muslim teacher, Hayat Shah, son of the famous Punjabi poet, Hashim to teach him Persian.\n\nWhilst at junior school, he saw Sikh soldiers and was so impressed with them that he decided to keep unshorn hair. In 1906, when he was in the ninth grade he became Amritdhari and assumed the name of \"Sahib Singh\". It was the time when he stopped learning Persian and started learning Sanskrit, which later on helped him in understanding Guru Granth Sahib ji.\n\nAfter passing the tenth grade, Bhai Sahib joined a local school. Later, he applied for a job with the postal department, and got the job, borrowing 20 Rs from his house maid as traveling expenses.\n\nSoon Bhai Sahib Singhs' desire for higher education became so great that he left home. He had nowhere to go with virtually no money in his pocket. He later met Pundit Vesta Parsad, a scholarly teacher for help.\n\nSahib Singh ji passed his FA and BA and started work at Frakka college and later joined Gujranwala Khalsa college. It was at this college that he met Bava Harkrishan Singh and Bhai Jodh Singh. Sahib Singh's financial situation had improved by this time so that he was able to pay back his debts.\n\nThe untimely death of his father made the situation hard for him, yet he managed to enter Dyal Singh College, Lahore, and then the Government College, Lahore where he obtained his bachelor's degree. In 1917 he joined Guru Nanak Khalsa College, Gujranwala as a lecturer in Sanskrit. In 1921 Bhai Sahib Singh ji became the Assistant General Secretary of the SGPC. Bhai Sahib Singh took part in Guru Ka Bagh Morcha in 1922 and was arrested. In 1923 Bhai ji was again arrested when he took part in Jaito Morcha. In 1927 Bhai ji rejoined Gujranwala college, where he stayed until 1936. At this time Bhai ji moved to Amritsar and joined the Khalsa college as a lecturer in Punjabi. At the college he met fellow Sikh scholars like Professor Teja Singh, Professor Ganda Singh, Bhai Veeram Singh and Prof Mohan Singh ji. In 1952 Sahib Singh ji retired from this college to take up a post as Principal at Shaheed Missionary college, Amritsar. In 1962 Bhai ji left to join his son at Sidhwan Bet near Jagroan. When his son moved to Patiala, Bhai ji took classes at Gurmat college in Patiala. He was awarded D.Lit by Punjabi University, Patiala in 1971.\n\nProf. Sahib Singh was often afflicted with illnesses due to his tough working schedule. Nonetheless, Prof. Sahib Singh was a very strong willed person and remained in eternal happiness. Ultimately, he became very ill, being afflicted with Parkinson's disease. Bhai Sahib left for heavenly abode on 29 October 1977.\n\nProf. Sahib Singh wrote extensively in Punjabi, but most of his works have now been translated into English, Hindi and other prominent world languages.\n\n\n\nThe translation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib by Professor Sahib Singh has been made available on the Gurbani-CD and on the Internet. The typing work of this Teeka was spearheaded by Avtar Singh Dhami of Union City, California, United States. Dr. Thind formatted the text of Teeka by Professor Sahib Singh to improve the use of text on the computer and for the Internet. He also made the web pages of Teeka that are available on http://www.gurugranthdarpan.com\n\n\n"}
{"id": "222679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222679", "title": "Salishan languages", "text": "Salishan languages\n\nThe Salishan (also Salish) languages are a group of languages of the Pacific Northwest in North America (the Canadian province of British Columbia and the American states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana). They are characterised by agglutinativity and syllabic consonants. For instance the Nuxalk word \"clhp’xwlhtlhplhhskwts’\" (), meaning \"he had had [in his possession] a bunchberry plant\", has thirteen obstruent consonants in a row with no phonetic or phonemic vowels. The Salishan languages are a geographically continuous block, with the exception of the Nuxalk (Bella Coola), in the Central Coast of British Columbia, and the extinct Tillamook language, to the south on the central coast of Oregon.\n\nThe terms \"Salish\" and \"Salishan\" are used interchangeably by linguists and anthropologists studying Salishan, but this is confusing in regular English usage. The name \"Salish\" or \"Selisch\" is the endonym of the Flathead Nation. Linguists later applied the name Salish to related languages in the Pacific Northwest. Many of the peoples do not have self-designations (autonyms) in their languages; they frequently have specific names for local dialects, as the local group was more important culturally than larger tribal relations.\n\nAll Salishan languages are considered critically endangered, some extremely so, with only three or four speakers left. Those languages considered extinct are often referred to as 'sleeping languages,' in that no speakers exist currently. In the early 21st century, few Salish languages have more than 2,000 speakers. Fluent, daily speakers of almost all Salishan languages are generally over sixty years of age; many languages have only speakers over eighty. Salishan languages are most commonly written using the Americanist phonetic notation to account for the various vowels and consonants that do not exist in most modern alphabets. Many groups have evolved their own distinctive uses of the Latin alphabet, however, such as the St'at'imc.\n\nThe Salishan language family consists of twenty-three languages. Below is a list of Salishan languages, dialects, and subdialects. The genetic unity among the Salish languages is evident. Neighboring groups have communicated often, to the point that it is difficult to untangle the influence each dialect and language has upon others.\n\nA 1969 study found that \"language relationships are highest and closest among the Interior Division, whereas they are most distant among the Coast Division.\"\n\nThis list is a linguistic classification that may not correspond to political divisions. In contrast to classifications made by linguistic scholars, many Salishan groups consider their particular variety of speech to be a separate language rather than a dialect.\n\nPentlatch, Nooksack, Twana, Lower Chehalis, Upper Chehalis, Cowlitz, Klallam, and Tillamook are now extinct. Additionally, the Lummi, Semiahmoo, Songhees, and Sooke dialects of Northern Straits are also extinct.\n\nNo relationship to any other language family is well established.\n\nEdward Sapir suggested that the Salishan languages might be related to the Wakashan and Chimakuan languages in a hypothetical Mosan family. This proposal persists primarily through Sapir’s stature: with little evidence for such a family, no progress has been made in reconstructing it.\n\nThe Salishan languages, principally Chehalis, contributed greatly to the vocabulary of the Chinook Jargon.\n\n\nSalishan languages are known for their polysynthetic nature. A verb stem will often have at least one affix, which is typically a suffix. These suffixes perform a variety of functions, such as transitive, causative, reciprocal, reflexive, and applicative. Applicative affixes seem to be present on the verb when the direct object is central to the event being discussed, but isn’t the theme of the sentence. The direct object may be a recipient, for example.\n\nIt may also refer to a related noun phrase, like the goal a verb intends to achieve, or the instrument used in carrying out the action of the verb. In the sentence ‘The man used the axe to chop the log with.’, the axe is the instrument and is indicated in Salish through an applicative affix on the verb. Applicative affixes increase the number of affixes a verb can take on, that is, its syntactic valence. They are also known as \"transitivizers\" because they can change a verb from intransitive to transitive. For example, in the sentence 'I got scared.', 'scared' is intransitive. However, with the addition of an applicative affix, which is syntactically transitive, the verb in Salish becomes transitive and the sentence can come to mean ‘I got scared of you.’.\n\nAlthough there is a wide array of Salish languages, they all share some basic traits. All are verb initial languages, with VSO (verb-subject-object) being the most common word order. Some Salishan languages allow for VOS and SVO as well. There is no case marking, but central noun phrases will often be preceded by determiners while non-central NPs will take prepositions. Some Salishan languages are ergative, and many take unique object agreement forms in passive statements. Subject and object pronouns usually take the form of affixes that attach to the verb. All Salish languages are head-marking. Possession is marked on the possessed noun phrase as either a prefix or a suffix, while person is marked on predicates. In Central Salish languages like Tillamook and Shuswap, only one plain NP is permitted aside from the subject.\n\nThere are three general patterns of negation among the Salishan languages. The most common pattern involves a negative predicate in the form of an impersonal and intransitive stative verb, which occurs in sentence initial position. The second pattern involves a sentence initial negative particle that is often attached to the sentence’s subject, and the last pattern simply involves a sentence initial negative particle without any change in inflectional morphology or a determiner/complementizer. In addition, there is a fourth restricted pattern that has been noted only in Squamish.\n\nSalishan languages (along with the Wakashan and the extinct Chimakuan languages) exhibit predicate/argument flexibility. All content words are able to occur as the head of the predicate (including words with typically 'noun-like' meanings that refer to entities) or in an argument (including those with 'verb-like' meanings that refer to events). Words with noun-like meanings are automatically equivalent to [be + NOUN] when used predicatively, such as Lushootseed sbiaw which means '(is a) coyote'. Words with more verb-like meanings, when used as arguments, are equivalent to [one that VERBs] or [VERB+er]. For example, Lushootseed ʔux̌ʷ means '(one that) goes'.\n\nThe following examples are from Lushootseed.\n\nAn almost identical pair of sentences from St’át’imcets demonstrates that this phenomenon is not restricted to Lushootseed.\n\nThis and similar behaviour in other Salish and Wakashan languages has been used as evidence for a complete lack of a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs in these families. This has become controversial in recent years. David Beck of the University of Alberta contends that there is evidence for distinct lexical categories of 'noun' and 'verb' by arguing that, although any distinction is neutralised in predicative positions, words that can be categorised as 'verbs' are marked when used in syntactic argument positions. He argues that Salishan languages are omnipredicative, but only have 'uni-directional flexibility' (not 'bi-directional flexibility'), which makes Salishan languages no different from other omnipredicative languages such as Arabic and Nahuatl, which have a clear lexical noun-verb distinction.\n\nBeck does concede, however, that the Lushootseed argument \"ti ʔux̌ʷ\" ('the one who goes', shown in example sentence (1b) above) does represent an example of an unmarked 'verb' used as an argument and that further research may potentially substantiate M. Dale Kinkade's 1983 position that all Salishan content words are essentially 'verbs' (such as \"ʔux̌ʷ\" 'goes' and \"sbiaw\" 'is a coyote') and that the use of any content word as an argument involves an underlying relative clause. For example, with the determiner \"ti\" translated as 'that which', the arguments \"ti ʔux̌ʷ\" and \"ti sbiaw\" would be most literally translated as 'that which goes' and 'that which is a coyote' respectively.\n\nThere are twenty-three languages in the Salishan language family. They occupy the Pacific Northwest, with all but two of them being concentrated together in a single large area. It is clear that these languages are related, but it’s difficult to track the development of each because their histories are so interwoven. The different speech communities have interacted a great deal, making it nearly impossible to decipher the influences of varying dialects and languages on one another. However, there are several trends and patterns that can be historically traced to generalize the development of the Salishan languages over the years.\n\nThe variation between the Salishan languages seems to depend on two main factors: the distance between speech communities and the geographic barriers between them. The diversity between the languages corresponds directly to the distance between them. Closer proximity often entails more contact between speakers, and more linguistics similarities are the result. Geographic barriers like mountains impede contact, so two communities that are relatively close together may still vary considerably in their language use if there is a mountain dividing them.\n\nThe rate of change between neighboring Salishan languages often depends on their environments. If for some reason two communities diverge, their adaptation to a new environment can separate them linguistically from each other. The need to create names for tools, animals, and plants creates an array of new vocabulary that divides speech communities. However, these new names may come from borrowing from neighboring languages, in which case two languages or dialects can grow more alike rather than apart. Interactions with outside influences through trade and intermarriage often result in language change as well.\n\nSome cultural elements are more resilient to language change, namely, religion and folklore. Salishan language communities that have demonstrated change in technology and environmental vocabulary have often remained more consistent with their religious terminology. Religion and heavily ingrained cultural traditions are often regarded as sacred, and so are less likely to undergo any sort of change. Indeed, cognate lists between various Salishan languages show more similarities in religious terminology than they do in technology and environment vocabulary. Other categories with noticeable similarities include words for body parts, colors, and numbers. There would be little need to change such vocabulary, so it’s more likely to remain the same despite other changes between languages. The Coast Salishan languages are less similar to each other than are the Interior Salishan languages, probably because the Coast communities have more access to outside influences.\n\nAnother example of language change in the Salishan language family is word taboo, which is a cultural expression of the belief in the power of words. Among the Coast languages, a person’s name becomes a taboo word immediately following their death. This taboo is lifted when the name of the deceased is given to a new member of his/her lineage. In the meantime, the deceased person’s name and words that are phonetically similar to the name are considered taboo and can only be expressed via descriptive phrases. In some cases these taboo words are permanently replaced by their chosen descriptive phrases, resulting in language change.\n\nAt least one Salish language, Lillooet Salish, differs from Indo-European languages in terms of pragmatics. Lillooet Salish does not allow presuppositions about a hearer's beliefs or knowledge during a conversation. To demonstrate, it’s useful to compare Lillooet Salish determiners with English determiners. English determiners take the form of the articles ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’. The indefinite articles ‘a’ and ‘an’ refer to an object that is unfamiliar or that has not been previously referenced in conversation. The definite article ‘the’ refers to a familiar object about which both the speaker and the listener share a common understanding. Lillooet Salish and several other Salish languages use the same determiner to refer to both familiar and unfamiliar objects in conversation. For example, when discussing a woman, Lillooet Salish speakers used [ɬəsɬánay] (with [ɬə] serving as the determiner and [sɬánay] meaning ‘woman’) to refer to the woman both when initially introducing her and again when referencing her later on in the conversation. Thus, no distinction is made between a unique object and a familiar one. \n\nThis absence of varying determiners is a manifestation of the lack of presuppositions about a listener in Salish. Using a definite article would presuppose a mental state of the listener: familiarity with the object in question. Similarly, a Salishan language equivalent of the English sentence \"It was John who called\" would not require the assumption that the listener knows that someone called. In English, such a sentence implies that someone called and serves to clarify who the caller was. In Salish, the sentence would be void of any implication regarding the listener’s knowledge. Rather, only the speaker’s knowledge about previous events is expressed.\n\nThe absence of presuppositions extends even to elements that seem to inherently trigger some kind of implication, such as ‘again’, ‘more’, ‘stop’, and ‘also’. For example, in English, beginning a conversation with a sentence like \"It also rained yesterday\" would probably be met with confusion from the listener. The word ‘also’ signifies an addition to some previously discussed topic about which both the speaker and the listener are aware. However, in Salish, a statement like \"It also rained yesterday\" is not met with the same kind of bewilderment. The listener’s prior knowledge (or lack thereof) is not conventionally regarded by either party in a conversation. Only the speaker’s knowledge is relevant.\n\nThe use of pronouns illustrates the disregard for presuppositions as well. For example, a sentence like \"She walked there, and then Brenda left\" would be acceptable on its own in Lillooet Salish. The pronoun ‘she’ can refer to Brenda and be used without the introduction that would be necessary in English. It is key to note that presuppositions do exist in Salishan languages; they simply don’t have to be shared between the speaker and listener the way they do in English and other Indo-European languages. The above examples demonstrate that presuppositions are present, but the fact that the listener doesn’t necessarily have to be aware of them signifies that the presuppositions only matter to the speaker. They are indicative of prior information that the speaker alone may be aware of, and his/her speech reflects merely his/her perspective on a situation without taking into account the listener’s knowledge. Although English values a common ground between a listener and speaker and thus requires that some presuppositions about another person's knowledge be made, Salish does not share this pragmatic convention.\n\nStanley Evans has written a series of crime fiction novels that use Salish lore and language.\n\nAn episode of \"Stargate SG-1\" (\"Spirits\", 2x13) features a culture of extraterrestrial humans loosely inspired by Pacific coastal First Nations culture, and who speak a language referred to as \"ancient Salish\".\n\nIn the video game \"Life is Strange\", the Salish lore was used on certain history of Arcadia Bay as totem poles are seen on some areas. Including a segment from the first episode of its involving the raven\n\n\n"}

Typically a candidate who schedules many appearances prepares a short standardized stump speech that is repeated verbatim to each audience, before opening to questions.\n\nThe term derives from the early American custom in which candidates campaigned from town to town and stood upon a sawed off tree stump to deliver their speech.\n\nIn presidential campaigns in the United States, a candidate's speech at his or her party's presidential nominating convention usually forms the basis for the stump speech for the duration of the national campaign.\n\nStump speeches are not meant to generate news, outside of local media covering a candidate's appearance. National media usually ignore their contents in their daily news coverage. The predictability of stump speeches gives reporters a general indication that the candidate will soon conclude his speech. An example of this comes from Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller, who would constantly use the phrase \"the brotherhood of man, under the fatherhood of God\" toward the end of his speeches during his multiple bids for the Republican Party presidential nomination. Reporters covering Rockefeller came to abbreviate the expression as BOMFOG.\n\nAn example is provided by the Washington Post on a 2008 presidential candidate Barack Obama speech, complete with time line, segmentation and videos. https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/02/26/GR2008022600417.html.\n"}
{"id": "185901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185901", "title": "Subspecies", "text": "Subspecies\n\nIn biological classification, the term subspecies refers to a unity of populations of a species living in a subdivision of the species' global range and varies from other populations of the same species by morphological characteristics.\nA subspecies cannot be recognized independently. A species is either recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two, including any that are extinct. The term is abbreviated subsp. in botany and bacteriology, or ssp. in zoology. The plural is the same as the singular: \"subspecies\".\n\nIn zoology, under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the subspecies is the only taxonomic rank below that of species that can receive a name. In botany and mycology, under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, other infraspecific ranks, such as variety, may be named. In bacteriology and virology, under standard bacterial nomenclature and virus nomenclature, there are recommendations but not strict requirements for recognizing other important infraspecific ranks.\n\nA taxonomist decides whether to recognize a subspecies or not. A common criterion for a subspecies is its ability of interbreeding with a different subspecies of the same species and producing fertile offspring. In the wild, subspecies do not interbreed due to their geographic isolation and sexual selection. The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species.\n\nIn zoology, the \"International Code of Zoological Nomenclature\" (4th edition, 1999) accepts only one rank below that of species, namely the rank of subspecies. Other groupings, \"infrasubspecific entities\" do not have names regulated by the \"ICZN\". Such forms have no official \"ICZN\" status, though they may be useful in describing altitudinal or geographical clines, pet breeds, transgenic animals, etc. While the scientific name of a species is a binomen, the scientific name of a subspecies is a trinomen - a binomen followed by a subspecific name. A tiger's binomen is \"Panthera tigris\", so for a Sumatran tiger the trinomen is, for example, \"Panthera tigris sumatrae\". \"Subspecies\" is generally abbreviated as \"ssp.\" in zoology, but is not used in scientific name.\n\nIn botany, subspecies is one of many ranks below that of species, such as variety, subvariety, form, and subform. The subspecific name is preceded by \"subsp.\", as in \"Schoenoplectus californicus\" subsp. \"tatora\". A botanical name consists of at most three parts. An infraspecific name includes the species binomial, and one infraspecific epithet, such as subspecies or variety.\n\nIn bacteriology, the only rank below species that is regulated explicitly by the code of nomenclature is \"subspecies\", but infrasubspecific taxa are extremely important in bacteriology; Appendix 10 of the code lays out some recommendations that are intended to encourage uniformity in describing such taxa. Names published before 1992 in the rank of \"variety\" are taken to be names of subspecies (see \"International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes\"). As in botany, \"subspecies\" is conventionally abbreviated as \"subsp.\", and is used in the scientific name: \"Bacillus subtilis\" subsp. \"spizizenii\".\n\nIn zoological nomenclature, when a species is split into subspecies, the originally described population is retained as the \"nominotypical subspecies\" or \"nominate subspecies\", which repeats the same name as the species. For example, \"Motacilla alba alba\" (often abbreviated \"M. a. alba\") is the nominotypical subspecies of the white wagtail (\"Motacilla alba\").\n\nThe subspecies name that repeats the species name is referred to in botanical nomenclature as the subspecies \"autonym\", and the subspecific taxon as the \"autonymous subspecies\".\n\nWhen zoologists disagree over whether a certain population is a subspecies or a full species, the species name may be written in parentheses. Thus \"Larus (argentatus) smithsonianus\" means the American herring gull; the notation within the parentheses means that some consider it a subspecies of a larger herring gull species and therefore call it \"Larus argentatus smithsonianus\", while others consider it a full species and therefore call it \"Larus smithsonianus\" (and the user of the notation is not taking a position).\n\nA subspecies is a taxonomic rank below species – the only recognized rank in the zoological code, and one of three main ranks below species in the botanical code. When geographically separate populations of a species exhibit recognizable phenotypic differences, biologists may identify these as separate subspecies; a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species. Botanists and mycologists have the choice of ranks lower than subspecies, such as variety (varietas) or form (forma), to recognize smaller differences between populations.\n\nIn biological terms, rather than in relation to nomenclature, a \"polytypic\" species has two or more genetically and phenotypically divergent subspecies, races, or more generally speaking, populations that need a separate description. These are separate groups that are clearly distinct from one another and do not generally interbreed, although there may be a relatively narrow hybridization zone, but which may interbreed if given the chance to do so. These subspecies, races, or populations, can be named as subspecies by zoologists, or in more varied ways by botanists and microbiologists.\n\nA \"monotypic\" species has no distinct population or races, or rather one race comprising the whole species. A taxonomist would not name a subspecies within such a species. Monotypic species can occur in several ways:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39202", "title": "Telugu language", "text": "Telugu language\n\nTelugu (; ) is a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and the union territories of Puducherry (Yanam) by the Telugu people and it is one of 22 scheduled languages of India. It stands alongside Hindi, English and Bengali as one of the few languages with official primary language status in more than one Indian state. There are also significant linguistic minorities in neighbouring states. It is one of six languages designated a classical language of India by the country's government.\n\nTelugu ranks fourth among the languages with the highest number of native speakers in India, with 6.93 percent at the 2011 census, and fifteenth in the Ethnologue list of most widely-spoken languages worldwide. It is the most widely spoken member of the Dravidian language family. It is one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India. Roughly 10,000 pre-colonial inscriptions exist in the Telugu language.\n\nSpeakers of Telugu refer to it as Telugu itself. Older forms of the name include \"Teluṅgu\", \"Tenuṅgu\" and \"Teliṅga\".\n\nThe etymology of Telugu is not certain. Some historical scholars have suggested a derivation from Sanskrit \"triliṅgam\", as in \"Trilinga Desam\", \"the country of the three lingas\".\n\nAtharvana Acharya in the 13th century wrote a grammar of Telugu, calling it the \"Trilinga Śabdānusāsana (or Trilinga Grammar)\". Appa Kavi in the 17th century explicitly wrote that Telugu was derived from \"Trilinga\". Scholar Charles P. Brown made a comment that it was a \"strange notion\" since the predecessors of Appa Kavi had no knowledge of such a derivation.\n\nGeorge Abraham Grierson and other linguists doubt this derivation, holding rather that Telugu was the older term and \"Trilinga\" must be the later Sanskritisation of it. If so the derivation itself must have been quite ancient because \"Triglyphum\", \"Trilingum\" and \"Modogalingam\" are attested in ancient Greek sources, the last of which can be interpreted as a Telugu rendition of \"Trilinga\".\n\nAnother view holds that \"tenugu\" is derived from the proto-Dravidian word \"ten\" (\"south\") to mean \"the people who lived in the south/southern direction\" (relative to Sanskrit and Prakrit-speaking peoples). The name \"telugu\", then, is a result of an 'n' to 'l' alternation established in Telugu.\n\nAccording to linguist Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, Telugu, as a Dravidian language, descends from Proto-Dravidian, a proto-language. Linguistic reconstruction suggests that Proto-Dravidian was spoken around the third millennium BCE, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin in peninsular India. According to the Russian linguist Mikhail S. Andronov, Telugu split from the Proto-Dravidian language between 1500 and 1000 BCE.\n\nA legend gives the town of Lepakshi a significant place in the Ramayanam. This was where the bird Jatayu fell, wounded after a futile battle against Ravana who was carrying away Sita. When Sri Rama reached the spot, he saw the bird and said compassionately, \"Le, Pakshi\" — translated to ‘rise, bird’. This indicates the presence of Telugu Language in ancient Indian literature.\n\nIt has been argued that there is a historical connection between the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia and the Telugu speaking peoples.\n\nPrakrit Inscriptions with some Telugu words dating back to between 400 BCE and 100 BCE have been discovered in Bhattiprolu in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. The English translation of an inscription reads, \"gift of the slab by venerable Midikilayakha\".\n\nThe coin legends of the Satavahanas, in all areas and all periods, used a Prakrit dialect without exception. Some reverse coin legends are in Tamil, and Telugu languages.\n\nDated between 200 BCE – 300 CE, a Prakrit work called Gāthā Saptaśatī written by Sathavahana King Hala, Telugu words like అత్త, వాలుంకి, పీలుఅ, పోట్టం, కిలించిఅః, అద్దాఏ, భోండీ, సరఅస్స, తుప్ప, ఫలహీ, వేంట, రుంప-రంప, మడహసరిఆ, వోడసుణఓ, సాఉలీ and తీరఏ have been used.\n\nCertain exploration and excavation missions conducted by the Archaeological Department in and around the Keesaragutta temple have brought to light, a number of brick temples, cells and other structures encompassed by brick prakaram along with coins, beads, stucco figures, garbhapatra, pottery, and Brahmi label inscriptions datable to 4th and 5th centuries CE. On top of one of the rock-cut caves, an early Telugu label inscription reading as ‘Thulachuvanru’ can be noticed. On the basis of palaeography, the inscription is dated around the 4th to 5th centuries CE.\n\nOne of the first words in the Telugu language, \"Nagabu\", was found in a Sanskrit inscription of the 1st century B.C at Amaravathi (not to be confused with the newly planned city of Amaravati). Telugu words were also found in the Dharmasila inscription of Emperor Ashoka. A number of Telugu words were found in the Sanskrit and Prakrit inscriptions of the Satavahanas, Vishnukundinas, and Ikshwakas.\n\nAccording to Telugu lore, its grammar has a prehistoric past. Sage kanva was said to be the languages first grammarian. A Rajeswara Sarma discussed the historicity and content of Kanva's grammar. He cited twenty grammatical aphorisms ascribed to Kanva, and concluded that Kanva wrote an ancient Telugu Grammar which was lost.\n\n“The Bhattiprolu stone Buddhist casket in proto Telugu belongs to BCE 300 (Ref.Epigraphia Indica Vol.ii, page no.232), the Erragudi Asokan Rock Edict in Proto Telugu belongs to 257 BCE (DC Sarkar’s Ashokan Studies, Calcutta 1979 pages 7–8), the Ghantasala Brahmin inscription. Epigraphia Indica, Vol. 27–1947–48, pages 1 to 4 and the pillar inscription of Vijaya Satakarni, Vijayapuri, Nagarjunakonda etc., belongs to First Century CE. Further, Tummalagudem inscription of Vishnukundinas belongs to 5th Century CE. (Epigraphia Andhrika, Vol.ii pages 9 to 14)”.\n\nThe period from 575 CE to 1022 CE corresponds to the second phase of Telugu history, after the Andhra Ikshvaku period. This is evidenced by the first inscription that is entirely in Telugu, dated 575 CE, which was found in the Rayalaseema region and is attributed to the Renati Cholas, who broke with the prevailing custom of using Sanskrit and began writing royal proclamations in the local language. During the next fifty years, Telugu inscriptions appeared in Anantapuram and other neighbouring regions.\n\nTelugu was more influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit during this period, which corresponded to the advent of Telugu literature. Telugu literature was initially found in inscriptions and poetry in the courts of the rulers, and later in written works such as Nannayya's \"Mahabharatam\" (1022 AD). During the time of Nannayya, the literary language diverged from the popular language. It was also a period of phonetic changes in the spoken language.\n\nThe third phase is marked by further stylization and sophistication of the literary languages. During this period the split of the Telugu from Kannada alphabets took place. Tikkana wrote his works in this script.\n\nThe Vijayanagara Empire gained dominance from 1336 to the late 17th century, reaching its peak during the rule of Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered its Golden Age.\n\nA distinct dialect developed in present day Telangana region, due to Persian/Arabic influence: the Delhi Sultanate of the Tughlaq dynasty was established earlier in the northern Deccan Plateau during the 14th century. In the latter half of the 17th century, the Mughal Empire extended further south, culminating in the establishment of the princely state of Hyderabad State by the dynasty of the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1724. This heralded an era of Persian influence on the Telugu language, especially Hyderabad State. The effect is also evident in the prose of the early 19th century, as in the \"Kaifiyats\".\n\nIn the princely Hyderabad State, the Andhra Mahasabha was started in 1921 with the main intention of promoting Telugu language, literature, its books and historical research led by Madapati Hanumantha Rao (the founder of the Andhra Mahasabha), Komarraju Venkata Lakshmana Rao (Founder of Library Movement in Hyderabad State), Suravaram Pratapa Reddy and others.\n\nThe 16th-century Venetian explorer Niccolò de' Conti, who visited the Vijayanagara Empire, found that the words in the Telugu language end with vowels, just like those in Italian, and hence referred it as \"The Italian of the East\"; a saying that has been widely repeated.\n\nIn the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, the influence of the English language was seen, and modern communication/printing press arose as an effect of the British rule, especially in the areas that were part of the Madras Presidency. Literature from this time had a mix of classical and modern traditions and included works by such scholars as Gidugu Venkata Ramamoorty, Kandukuri Veeresalingam, Gurazada Apparao, Gidugu Sitapati and Panuganti Lakshminarasimha Rao.\n\nSince the 1930s, what was considered an elite literary form of the Telugu language, has now spread to the common people with the introduction of mass media like movies, television, radio and newspapers. This form of the language is also taught in schools and colleges as a standard.\n\nas of 2017 census\n\nAccording to the famous Japanese Historian Noboru Karashima who served as the President of the Epigraphical Society of India in 1985, calculated that there are approximately 10,000 inscriptions which exist in the Telugu language as of the year 1996 making it one of the most densely inscribed languages. Telugu inscriptions are found in all the districts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They are also found in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. According to recent estimates by ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) the number of inscriptions in Telugu language goes up to 14,000.\n\nAndhra is characterised as having its own mother tongue, and its territory has been equated with the extent of the Telugu language. The equivalence between the Telugu linguistic sphere and geographical boundaries of Andhra is also brought out in an eleventh century description of Andhra boundaries. Andhra, according to this text, was bounded in north by Mahendra mountain in the modern Ganjam District of Orissa and to the south by Kalahasti temple in Chittor District. But Andhra extended westwards as far as Srisailam in the Kurnool District, about halfway across the modern state. Page number-36. According to other sources in the early sixteenth century, the northern boundary is Simhachalam and the southern limit is Tirupati or Tirumala Hill of the Telugu Country.\n\nTelugu place names are present all around Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Common suffixes are ooru, pudi, pedu, peta, patnam, wada, giri, cherla, seema, gudem, palle, palem and palli. Examples that use this are Guntur, Chintalapudi, Yerpedu, Suryapet, Vemulawada, Visakhapatnam, Ananthagiri Hills Vijayawada, Vuyyuru, Macherla, Poranki, Ramagundam, Warangal, Mancherial, Miryalagudem etc. They can also be seen in the border areas of Tamil Nadu.\n\nThere are three major dialects: Andhra dialect spoken in the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema dialect spoken in the four Rayalaseema districts of Andhra Pradesh and finally Telangana dialect, laced with Urdu words, spoken mainly in Telangana.\n\nWaddar, Chenchu, and Manna-Dora are all closely related to Telugu. Dialects of Telugu are Berad, Dasari, Dommara, Golari, Kamathi, Komtao, Konda-Reddi, Salewari, Vadaga, Srikakula, Vishakhapatnam, East Godaveri, Rayalseema, Nellore, Guntur, Vadari and Yanadi.\n\nIn Karnataka the dialect sees more influence of Kannada and is a bit different than what is spoken in Andhra. There are significant populations of Telugu speakers in the eastern districts of Karnataka viz. Bangalore Urban, Bellary, Chikballapur, Kolar.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu the Telugu dialect is classified into Hosur, Salem, Coimbatore, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai and Madras Telugu dialects. It is also spoken in pockets of Krishnagiri, Virudhunagar, Tuticorin, Tirunelveli, Madurai, Theni, Madras (Chennai) and Thanjavur districts.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, an ethnic gypsy minority known as the Ahikuntakas (otherwise called Kuravars) in the Batticaloa district speak a localised dialect in the form of Sri Lanka Gypsy Telugu.\n\nTelugu is natively spoken in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and Yanam district of Puducherry. Telugu speaking migrants are also found in the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, some parts of Jharkhand and the Kharagpur region of West Bengal in India. At 7.2% of the population, Telugu is the third-most-spoken language in the Indian subcontinent after Hindi and Bengali. In Karnataka, 7.0% of the population speak Telugu, and 5.6% in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe Telugu diaspora numbers more than 800,000 in the United States, with the highest concentration in Central New Jersey (\"Little Andhra\"); Telugu speakers are found as well in Australia, New Zealand, Bahrain, Canada (Toronto), Fiji, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius, Myanmar, Europe (Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom), South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, and United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Roman transliteration of the Telugu script is in National Library at Kolkata romanisation.\n\nTelugu words generally end in vowels. In Old Telugu, this was absolute; in the modern language \"m, n, y, w\" may end a word. Atypically for a Dravidian language, voiced consonants were distinctive even in the oldest recorded form of the language. Sanskrit loans have introduced aspirated and murmured consonants as well.\n\nTelugu does not have contrastive stress, and speakers vary on where they perceive stress. Most place it on the penultimate or final syllable, depending on word and vowel length.\n\nTelugu features a form of vowel harmony wherein the second vowel in disyllabic noun and adjective roots alters according to whether the first vowel is tense or lax. Also, if the second vowel is open (i.e., or ), then the first vowel is more open and centralized (e.g., 'goat', as opposed to 'nail'). Telugu words also have vowels in inflectional suffixes that are harmonized with the vowels of the preceding syllable.\n\nTelugu has two diphthongs: ఐ \"ai\" and ఔ \"au\" .\n\nThe table below lists the consonantal phonemes of Telugu.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>The aspirated and breathy-voiced consonants occur mostly in loan words, as do the fricatives apart from native .\n\nThe Telugu Grammar is called \"vyākaranam\" (వ్యాకరణం).\n\nThe first treatise on Telugu grammar, the \"Āndhra Śabda Cinṭāmaṇi\", was written in Sanskrit by Nannayya, considered the first Telugu poet and translator, in the 11th century CE. This grammar followed patterns described in grammatical treatises such as \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" and \"Vālmīkivyākaranam\", but unlike Pāṇini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering \"samjnā\", \"sandhi\", \"ajanta\", \"halanta\" and \"kriya\". Every Telugu grammatical rule is derived from Pāṇinian concepts.\n\nIn the 19th century, Chinnaya Suri wrote a simplified work on Telugu grammar called \"Bāla Vyākaraṇam\", borrowing concepts and ideas from Nannayya's grammar.\n\nThis sentence can also be interpreted as 'Rama will go to school', depending on the context, but it does not affect the SOV order.\n\nTelugu nouns are inflected for number (singular, plural), gender (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, vocative, instrumental, and locative).\n\nTelugu has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.\n\nTelugu pronouns include personal pronouns (the persons speaking, the persons spoken to, or the persons or things spoken about); indefinite pronouns; relative pronouns (connecting parts of sentences); and reciprocal or reflexive pronouns (in which the object of a verb is acted on by the verb's subject).\n\nTelugu uses the same forms for singular feminine and neuter gender—the third person pronoun (అది ) is used to refer to animals and objects.\n\nThe nominative case (\"karta\"), the object of a verb (\"karma\"), and the verb are somewhat in a sequence in Telugu sentence construction. \"\"Vibhakti\" (case of a noun) and \"pratyāyamulu\" (an affix to roots and words forming derivatives and inflections) depict the ancient nature and progression of the language. The \"Vibhaktis\"\" of Telugu language \" డు [ḍu], ము [mu], వు [vu], లు [lu]\", etc., are different from those in Sanskrit and have been in use for a long time.\n\nSanskrit influenced Telugu for about 1500 years; however, there is evidence that suggests an older influence. During the period 1000–1100 CE, Nannaya's re-writing of the \"Mahābhārata\" in Telugu (మహాభారతము) re-established its use, and it dominated over the royal language, Sanskrit. Telugu absorbed \"tatsama\"s from Sanskrit.\n\nThe vocabulary of Telugu, especially in Telangana, has a trove of Persian–Arabic borrowings, which have been modified to fit Telugu phonology. This was due to centuries of Turkic rule in these regions, such as the erstwhile kingdoms of Golkonda and Hyderabad (e.g., కబురు, for Urdu , or జవాబు, for Urdu , ).\n\nModern Telugu vocabulary can be said to constitute a diglossia because the formal, standardised version of the language is either lexically Sanskrit or heavily influenced by Sanskrit, is taught in schools, and is used by the government and Hindu religious institutions. However, everyday Telugu varies depending upon region.\n\nThe Telugu script is an abugida consisting of 60 symbols – 16 vowels, 3 vowel modifiers, and 41 consonants. Telugu has a complete set of letters that follow a system to express sounds. The script is derived from the Brahmi script like those of many other Indian languages. The Telugu script is written from left to right and consists of sequences of simple and/or complex characters. The script is syllabic in nature—the basic units of writing are syllables. Since the number of possible syllables is very large, syllables are composed of more basic units such as vowels (\"\"acchu\" or \"swaram\") and consonants (\"hallu\" or \"vyanjanam\"). Consonants in consonant clusters take shapes that are very different from the shapes they take elsewhere. Consonants are presumed pure consonants, that is, without any vowel sound in them. However, it is traditional to write and read consonants with an implied 'a' vowel sound. When consonants combine with other vowel signs, the vowel part is indicated orthographically using signs known as vowel \"mātras\". The shapes of vowel \"mātras\" are also very different from the shapes of the corresponding vowels.\n\nHistorically, a sentence used to end with either a single bar । (\"pūrna virāmam\") or a double bar ॥ (\"dīrgha virāmam\"\"); in handwriting, Telugu words were not separated by spaces. However, in modern times, English punctuation (commas, semicolon, etc.) has virtually replaced the old method of punctuation.\nTelugu has full-zero (\"anusvāra\") ( ం ), half-zero (\"arthanusvāra\" or \"candrabindu\") (ఁ) and \"visarga\" ( ః ) to convey various shades of nasal sounds. [la] and [La], [ra] and [Ra] are differentiated.\n\nTelugu has \"ĉ\" and \"ĵ\", which are not represented in Sanskrit. Their pronunciation is similar to the 's' sound in the word treasure (i.e., the postalveolar voiced fricative) and 'z' sound in zebra (i.e., the alveolar voiced fricative), respectively.\n\nThese are some examples of combining a consonant with different vowels.\nక కా కి కీ కు కూ కృ కౄ కె కే కై కొ కో కౌ క్ కం కః\nఖ ఖా ఖి ఖీ ఖు ఖూ ఖృ ఖౄ ఖె ఖే ఖై ఖొ ఖో ఖౌ ఖ్ ఖం ఖః\n\nTelugu has ten digits employed with the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. However, in modern usage, the Arabic numerals have replaced them.\n\nTelugu is assigned Unicode codepoints: 0C00-0C7F (3072–3199).\n\nIn the earliest period Telugu literature existed in the form of inscriptions, precisely from 575 CE onward.\n\nPrabandha Ratnavali (1918) & Pre-Nannayya Chandassu (Raja Raja Narendra Pattabhisekha Sanchika) by Veturi Prabhakara Sastry talk about the existence of Jain Telugu literature during 850-1000 CE. A verse from Telugu Jinendra Puranam by Padma Kavi (Pampa), a couple of verses from Telugu Adi Puranam by Sarvadeva and Kavijanasrayam (a Telugu Chandassu poetic guide for poets) affiliation to Jainism were discussed.\n\nHistorically, Vemulawada was a Jain knowledge hub and played a significant role in patronizing Jain literature and poets.1980s excavations around Vemulawada revealed and affirmed the existence of Telugu Jain literature.\n\nMalliya Rechana - First Telugu Author (940 CE) - P.V.Parabrahma Sastry, Nidadavolu Venkata Rao .P.V.P Sastry also points out that many Jain works could have been destroyed. Historical rivalry among Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism is well known.\n\nThis is the period of Kavi Trayam or Trinity of Poets. Nannayya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada (or Errana) are known as the Kavi Trayam.\n\nNannaya Bhattarakudu's (Telugu: నన్నయ) Andhra mahabharatam, who lived around the 11th century, is commonly referred to as the first Telugu literary composition (aadi kaavyam).[citation needed] Although there is evidence of Telugu literature before Nannaya, he is given the epithet Aadi Kavi (\"the first poet\"). Nannaya was the first to establish a formal grammar of written Telugu. This grammar followed the patterns which existed in grammatical treatises like Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vālmīkivyākaranam but unlike Pāṇini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering samjnā, sandhi, ajanta, halanta and kriya.[14] Nannaya completed the first two chapters and a part of the third chapter of the Mahabharata epic, which is rendered in the Champu style.\n\nTikkana Somayaji (1205–1288 CE): Nannaya's Andhra Mahabharatam was almost completed by Tikanna Somayaji (Telugu: తిక్కన సోమయాజి) (1205–1288) who wrote chapters 4 to 18.\n\nYerrapragada : (Telugu: ఎర్రాప్రగడ) who lived in the 14th century, finished the epic by completing the third chapter. He mimics Nannaya's style in the beginning, slowly changes tempo and finishes the chapter in the writing style of Tikkana. These three writers – Nannaya, Tikanna and Yerrapragada – are known as the Kavitraya (\"three great poets\") of Telugu. Other such translations like Marana’s Markandeya Puranam, Ketana’s Dasakumara Charita, Yerrapragada’s Harivamsam followed. Many scientific[relevant? ] works, like Ganitasarasangrahamu by Pavuluri Mallana and Prakirnaganitamu by Eluganti Peddana, were written in the 12th century.\n\nSumati Shatakam, which is a neeti (\"moral\"), is one of the most famous Telugu Shatakams.[citation needed] Shatakam is composed of more than a 100 padyalu (poems). According to many literary critics[who?] Sumati Shatakam was composed by Baddena Bhupaludu (Telugu: బద్దెన భూపాల) (CE 1220–1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Chola prince and a vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi, and a pupil of Tikkana.[citation needed] If we assume that the Sumati Shatakam was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Shatakams in Telugu along with the Vrushadhipa Satakam of Palkuriki Somanatha and the Sarveswara Satakam of Yathavakkula Annamayya.[original research?] The Sumatee Shatakam is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language, as C. P. Brown rendered it in English in the 1840s.\n\nPalkuriki Somanatha: Important among his Telugu language writings are the Basava Purana, Panditaradhya charitra, Malamadevipuranamu and Somanatha Stava–in dwipada metre (\"couplets\"); Anubhavasara, Chennamallu Sisamalu, Vrishadhipa Shataka and Cheturvedasara–in verses; Basavodharana in verses and ragale metre (rhymed couplets in blank verse); and the Basavaragada.\n\nGona Budda Reddy: His Ranganatha Ramayanam was a pioneering work in the Telugu language on the theme of the Ramayana epic. Most scholars believe he wrote it between 1300 and 1310 A.D., possibly with help from his family. The work has become part of cultural life in Andhra Pradesh and is used in puppet shows.\n\nIn the Telugu literature Tikkana was given agraasana (top position) by many famous critics.\n\nParavastu Chinnayya Soori (1807–1861) is a well-known Telugu writer who dedicated his entire life to the progress and promotion of Telugu language and literature. Sri Chinnayasoori wrote the \"Bala Vyakaranam\" in a new style after doing extensive research on Telugu grammar. Other well-known writings by Chinnayasoori are \"Neethichandrika\", \"Sootandhra Vyaakaranamu\", \"Andhra Dhatumoola\", and \"Neeti Sangrahamu\".\n\nKandukuri Veeresalingam (1848–1919) is generally considered the father of modern Telugu literature. His novel \"Rajasekhara Charitamu\" was inspired by the Vicar of Wakefield. His work marked the beginning of a dynamic of socially conscious Telugu literature and its transition to the modern period, which is also part of the wider literary renaissance that took place in Indian culture during this period. Other prominent literary figures from this period are Gurajada Appa Rao, Viswanatha Satyanarayana, Gurram Jashuva, Rayaprolu Subba Rao, Devulapalli Krishnasastri and Srirangam Srinivasa Rao, popularly known as \"Mahakavi\" Sri Sri. Sri Sri was instrumental in popularising free verse in spoken Telugu (\"vaaduka bhasha\"), as opposed to the pure form of written Telugu used by several poets in his time. Devulapalli Krishnasastri is often referred to as the Shelley of Telugu literature because of his pioneering works in Telugu Romantic poetry.\n\nViswanatha Satyanarayana won India's national literary honour, the Jnanpith Award for his magnum opus \"Ramayana Kalpavrukshamu\". C. Narayana Reddy won the Jnanpith Award in 1988 for his poetic work, \"Viswambara\". Ravuri Bharadhwaja won the 3rd Jnanpith Award for Telugu literature in 2013 for \"Paakudu Raallu\", a graphic account of life behind the screen in film industry. \"Kanyasulkam\", the first social play in Telugu by Gurajada Appa Rao, was followed by the progressive movement, the free verse movement and the Digambara style of Telugu verse. Other modern Telugu novelists include Unnava Lakshminarayana (\"Maalapalli\"), Bulusu Venkateswarulu (\"Bharatiya Tatva Sastram\"), Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao and Buchi Babu.\n\nTelugu input, display, and support were initially provided on the Microsoft Windows platform. Subsequently, various browsers, office applications, operating systems, and user interfaces were localized for Windows and Linux platforms by vendors and free and open-source software volunteers. Telugu-capable smart phones were also introduced by vendors in 2013.\n\nOn 15 February 2018, Apple devices were experiencing crashes of apps and device shutdowns when two particular characters from the Telugu language (specifically జ్ఞా) was rendered on the display. Reports show that this has affected iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. On 20 February, Apple announced that the bug was fixed with the iOS 11.2.6 update.\n\n\n\n"}
