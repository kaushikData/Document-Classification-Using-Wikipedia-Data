There is also no separate Deaf culture or politics.\n\nIn 2004, the Al-Sayyid community numbered around 3,000, most of whom trace their ancestry to the time the village was founded, in the mid-19th century, by a local woman and an Egyptian man. Two of this founding couple's five sons carried a gene for nonsyndromic, genetically recessive, profound pre-lingual neurosensory deafness. The descendants of the founding couple often married their cousins due to the tribe's rejection by its neighbours for being \"foreign fellahin\". The gene became homozygous in several members of the family.\n\nABSL was first studied in the late 1990s by anthropologist Shifra Kisch and came to worldwide attention in February 2005 when an international group of researchers published a study of the language in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\". The spontaneous emergence of the language in the last 70 years, which has developed a complex grammar in near-isolation, is of particular interest to linguists for the insights it provides into the birth of human language.\n\nScholars study ABSL because it is the closest they can come to performing the \"forbidden experiment\" (a type of language deprivation experiment in which children are isolated before they are exposed to any language so that experimenters may observe their organic formation of a language). Since deaf people in Al-Sayyid cannot hear Arabic or Hebrew and they have not been exposed to any other sign languages, ABSL is a brand new language, uninfluenced by any other. ABSL is in its early stages, so researchers are observing the language as it develops.\n\nABSL shows a preference for subject–object–verb word order (e.g., \"woman child feed\"), in marked contrast to the dialect of Arabic spoken by hearing members of the community (SVO), as well as Hebrew (SVO), classical Arabic (VSO), and the predominant sign languages in the region, Israeli Sign Language and Jordanian Sign Language. The authors of the study (Mark Aronoff from State University of New York at Stony Brook, Irit Meir and Wendy Sandler from the University of Haifa and Carol Padden from the University of California, San Diego) see ABSL as evidence for the human tendency to construct communication along grammatical lines. These authors remarked on the speed with which a grammar emerged, with the SOV word-order emerging with the first generation of signers, as well as the language's continuing rapid development – the third generation is signing twice as fast as the first and is using longer sentences.\n\nResearchers have detected examples of abstraction in the language, a sure sign of grammatical development. For example, the sign for \"man\" is formed by the curling of the finger in the shape of a mustache, although Bedouin men no longer wear mustaches. However, the language does not currently contain \"agreeing\" verbs, as most known sign languages do, which may indicate that the language has more grammatical development in store.\n\nThe community was isolated not by geography but by social stigma, on several levels. Contact with the outside world is growing, as students are exposed to Israeli Sign Language and Jordanian Sign Language in schools, and community members are marrying outside the community.\n\n\n"}

The project was started on November 13, 2003 as an Alsatian language edition. A year later it was expanded to encompass all Alemannic dialects because of low activity in the first year. Since 2004 all Alemannic dialects are accepted on als:wp.\n\nAs of 2018, this edition has about articles and is the 108th largest Wikipedia by number of articles. Contributors and users include people from Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Liechtenstein, and even a few Walser people from Italy.\n\nA peculiarity of the Alemannic Wikipedia is the wide range of dialects permitted; all varieties of Alemannic, including Swiss German, Swabian, Alsatian, and all others are accepted. Authors may not normally alter the dialect used by another contributor, though exceptions are made for local topics, in which modifying the text to reflect the local variety is encouraged. Articles may thus be written in a mix of different varieties. Since there is no standardized orthography for Alemannic, spelling rules are quite relaxed. However, contributors are encouraged to adhere to spelling conventions found in the Alemannic-language literature, and introducing new symbols is not tolerated.\n\nArticle titles are in Standard German, but display is frequently manipulated to show Alemannic text.\n\nThe code <nowiki>\"als\"</nowiki> was used because in 2003 there had been no language code for Alsatian. ISO 639-3 gives four codes for several Alemannic dialects:\nAs all of these four dialects are accepted on the Alemannic Wikipedia, it was decided not to move the Alemannic Wikipedia to gsw.wikipedia.org, even though the code <nowiki>als</nowiki> stands for Tosk Albanian in ISO 639-3. To solve this problem a request for a superior code for all Alemannic dialects has been submitted to SIL International by Alemannic Wikipedians.\n\nDespite the existence of dedicated ISO 639-3 codes and the possibility of more specific marking with country code subtags, all pages use 'gsw' in the HTML language tag.\n\nBelow is a list of dialects that have a category in and where that category contains at least one article.\n\nAlemannic Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia in a German dialect, followed by the Bavarian Wikipedia and the Ripuarian Wikipedia.\n\nOther Wikimedia projects in Alemanic have also been created, such as an Alemannic Wiktionary, an Alemannic Wikiquote, and an Alemannic Wikibooks. As activity in these projects was low even after years, the community of the Alemannic Wikipedia decided to merge all Alemannic projects and import all contents of the other projects into the Alemannic Wikipedia. Since April 2008 these projects are separate namespaces within the Alemannic Wikipedia. Also an Alemannic Wikisource and an Alemannic Wikinews have been created as separate namespaces within als:wp.\n\nWikidata supports one language with code 'gsw' and name 'Swiss German'. A proposal to remove it has not been adopted. .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "647729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=647729", "title": "Ambiguous grammar", "text": "Ambiguous grammar\n\nIn computer science, an ambiguous grammar is a context-free grammar for which there exists a string that can have more than one leftmost derivation or parse tree, while an unambiguous grammar is a context-free grammar for which every valid string has a unique leftmost derivation or parse tree. Many languages admit both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars, while some languages admit only ambiguous grammars. Any non-empty language admits an ambiguous grammar by taking an unambiguous grammar and introducing a duplicate rule or synonym (the only language without ambiguous grammars is the empty language). A language that only admits ambiguous grammars is called an inherently ambiguous language, and there are inherently ambiguous context-free languages. Deterministic context-free grammars are always unambiguous, and are an important subclass of unambiguous grammars; there are non-deterministic unambiguous grammars, however.\n\nFor computer programming languages, the reference grammar is often ambiguous, due to issues such as the dangling else problem. If present, these ambiguities are generally resolved by adding precedence rules or other context-sensitive parsing rules, so the overall phrase grammar is unambiguous. The set of all parse trees for an ambiguous sentence is called a \"parse forest\".\n\nThe simplest example is the following ambiguous grammar for the trivial language, which consists of only the empty string:\n…meaning that a production can either be itself again, or the empty string. Thus the empty string has leftmost derivations of length 1, 2, 3, and indeed of any length, depending on how many times the rule A → A is used.\n\nThis language also has the unambiguous grammar, consisting of a single production rule:\n…meaning that the unique production can only produce the empty string, which is the unique string in the language.\n\nIn the same way, any grammar for a non-empty language can be made ambiguous by adding duplicates.\n\nThe regular language of unary strings of a given character, say codice_1 (the regular expression codice_2), has the unambiguous grammar:\n…but also has the ambiguous grammar:\nThese correspond to producing a right-associative tree (for the unambiguous grammar) or allowing both left- and right- association. This is elaborated below.\n\nThe context free grammar\nis ambiguous since there are two leftmost derivations for the string a + a + a:\n\nAs another example, the grammar is ambiguous since there are two parse trees for the string a + a − a:\n\nThe language that it generates, however, is not inherently ambiguous; the following is a non-ambiguous grammar generating the same language:\n\nA common example of ambiguity in computer programming languages is the dangling else problem. In many languages, the codice_3 in an If–then(–else) statement is optional, which results in nested conditionals having multiple ways of being recognized in terms of the context-free grammar.\n\nConcretely, in many languages one may write conditionals in two valid forms: the if-then form, and the if-then-else form – in effect, making the else clause optional:\n\nIn a grammar containing the rules\n\nsome ambiguous phrase structures can appear. The expression\ncan be parsed as either\nor as\ndepending on whether the codice_3 is associated with the first codice_5 or second codice_5.\n\nThis is resolved in various ways in different languages. Sometimes the grammar is modified so that it is unambiguous, such as by requiring an codice_7 statement or making codice_3 mandatory. In other cases the grammar is left ambiguous, but the ambiguity is resolved by making the overall phrase grammar context-sensitive, such as by associating an codice_3 with the nearest codice_5. In this latter case the grammar is unambiguous, but the context-free grammar is ambiguous.\n\nIt should be noted that the existence of multiple derivations of the same string does not suffice to indicate that the grammar is ambiguous; only multiple \"leftmost\" derivations (or, equivalently, multiple parse trees) indicate ambiguity.\n\nFor example, the simple grammar\nis an unambiguous grammar for the language { 0+0, 0+1, 1+0, 1+1 }. While each of these four strings has only one leftmost derivation, it has two different derivations, for example\nand\nOnly the former derivation is a leftmost one.\n\nThe decision problem of whether an arbitrary grammar is ambiguous is undecidable because it can be shown that it is equivalent to the Post correspondence problem. At least, there are tools implementing some semi-decision procedure for detecting ambiguity of context-free grammars.\n\nThe efficiency of context-free grammar parsing is determined by the automaton that accepts it. Deterministic context-free grammars are accepted by deterministic pushdown automata and can be parsed in linear time, for example by the LR parser. This is a subset of the context-free grammars which are accepted by the pushdown automaton and can be parsed in polynomial time, for example by the CYK algorithm. Unambiguous context-free grammars can be nondeterministic.\n\nFor example, the language of even-length palindromes on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the unambiguous context-free grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string. Nevertheless, removing grammar ambiguity may produce a deterministic context-free grammar and thus allow for more efficient parsing. Compiler generators such as YACC include features for resolving some kinds of ambiguity, such as by using the precedence and associativity constraints.\n\nThe existence of inherently ambiguous languages was proven with Parikh's theorem in 1961 by Rohit Parikh in an MIT research report.\n\nWhile some context-free languages (the set of strings that can be generated by a grammar) have both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars, there exist context-free languages for which no unambiguous context-free grammar can exist. An example of an inherently ambiguous language is the union of formula_1 with formula_2. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But give a proof that there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) common subset formula_3.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "78426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78426", "title": "Aulus Gellius", "text": "Aulus Gellius\n\nAulus Gellius (c. 125after 180 AD) was a Latin author and grammarian, who was probably born and certainly brought up in Rome. He was educated in Athens, after which he returned to Rome. He is famous for his \"Attic Nights\", a commonplace book, or compilation of notes on grammar, philosophy, history, antiquarianism, and other subjects, preserving fragments of the works of many authors who might otherwise be unknown today.\n\nThe only source for the life of Aulus Gellius is the details recorded in his writings. Internal evidence points to Gellius having been born between AD 125 and 128. He was of good family and connections, possibly of African origin, but he was probably born and certainly brought up in Rome. He attended the Pythian Games in the year 147, and resided for a considerable period in Athens. Gellius studied rhetoric under Titus Castricius and Sulpicius Apollinaris; philosophy under Calvisius Taurus and Peregrinus Proteus; and enjoyed also the friendship and instruction of Favorinus, Herodes Atticus, and Fronto.\n\nHe returned to Rome, where he held a judicial office. He was appointed by the praetor to act as an umpire in civil causes, and much of the time which he would gladly have devoted to literary pursuits was consequently occupied by judicial duties. \n\nHis only known work, the \"Attic Nights\" (), takes its name from having been begun during the long nights of a winter which he spent in Attica. He afterwards continued it in Rome. It is compiled out of an \"Adversaria\", or commonplace book, in which he had jotted down everything of unusual interest that he heard in conversation or read in books, and it comprises notes on grammar, geometry, philosophy, history and many other subjects. One story is the fable of Androcles, which is often included in compilations of Aesop's fables, but was not originally from that source. Internal evidence led Leofranc Holford-Strevens to date its publication in or after AD 177.\n\nThe work, deliberately devoid of sequence or arrangement, is divided into twenty books. All these have come down to us except the eighth, of which nothing remains but the index. The \"Attic Nights\" are valuable for the insight they afford into the nature of the society and pursuits of those times, and for its many excerpts from works of lost ancient authors.\n\nThe \"Attic Nights\" found many readers in Antiquity. Writers who used this compilation include Apuleius, Lactantius, Nonius Marcellus, Ammianus Marcellinus, the anonymous author of the \"Historia Augusta\", Servius, and Augustine; but most notable is how Gellius' work was mined by Macrobius, \"who, without mentioning his name, quotes Gellius verbatim throughout the \"Saturnalia\", and is thus of the highest value for the text\".\n\nThe \"editio princeps\" was published at Rome in 1469 by Giovanni Andrea Bussi, bishop-designate of Aleria. The earliest critical edition was by Ludovicus Carrio in 1585, published by Henricus Stephanus; however, the projected commentary fell victim to personal quarrels. Better known is the critical edition of Johann Friedrich Gronovius ; although he devoted his entire life to work on Gellius, he died in 1671 before his work could be completed. His son Jakob published most of his comments on Gellius in 1687, and brought out a revised text with all of his father's comments and other materials at Leyden in 1706; this later work became known as the \"Gronoviana\". According to Leofranc Holford-Strevens, the \"Gronoviana\" remained the standard text of Gellius for over a hundred years, until the edition of Martin Hertz (Berlin, 1883–85; there is also a smaller edition by the same author, Berlin, 1886), revised by C. Hosius, 1903, with bibliography. A volume of selections, with notes and vocabulary, was published by Nall (London, 1888). There is an English translation by W. Beloe (London, 1795), and a French translation (1896). A more recent English translation is by John Carew Rolfe (1927) for the Loeb Classical Library.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1589878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1589878", "title": "Bactrian language", "text": "Bactrian language\n\nBactrian (Αριαο, \"Aryao\", ]) was an Iranian language which was spoken in the Central Asian region of Bactria (present-day Afghanistan and Tajikistan) and used as the official language of the Kushan and the Hephthalite empires.\n\nIt was long thought that Avestan represented \"Old Bactrian\", but this notion had \"rightly fallen into discredit by the end of the 19th century\".\n\nBactrian, which was written predominantly in an alphabet based on the Greek script, was known natively as αριαο \"/arjāu̯ɔ/\" (\"Arya\"; an endonym common amongst Iranian peoples). It has also been known by names such as Greco-Bactrian, Kushan or Kushano-Bactrian.\n\nUnder Kushan rule, Bactria became known as \"Tukhara\" or \"Tokhara\", and later as \"Tokharistan\". When texts in two extinct and previously unknown Indo-European languages were discovered in the Tarim Basin of China, during the early 20th century, they were linked circumstantially to Tokharistan, and Bactrian was sometimes referred to as \"Eteo-Tocharian\" (i.e. \"true\" or \"original\" Tocharian). By the 1970s, however, it became clear that there was little evidence for such a connection. For instance, the Tarim \"Tocharian\" languages were part of the so-called \"centum group\" within the Indo-European family, and were most closely related to the Anatolian languages, whereas Bactrian was a satemised Iranian language.\n\nBactrian is a part of the Eastern Iranian areal group, and shares features with the extinct Middle Iranian languages Sogdian and Khwarezmian (Eastern) and Parthian (Western), as well as with the modern Eastern Iranian languages Pashto, Yidgha, and Munji. Its genealogical position is unclear. According to another source, the present-day speakers of Munji, the modern Eastern Iranian language of the Munjan Valley in northeast Afghanistan, display the closest possible linguistic affinity with the Bactrian language.\n\nFollowing the conquest of Bactria by Alexander the Great in 323 BC, for about two centuries Greek was the administrative language of his Hellenistic successors, that is, the Seleucid and the Greco-Bactrian kingdoms. Eastern Scythian tribes (the Saka, or Sacaraucae of Greek sources) invaded the territory around 140 BC, and at some time after 124 BC, Bactria was overrun by a confederation of tribes belonging to the Great Yuezhi and \"Tokhari\". In the 1st century AD, the Kushana – one of the Yuezhi tribes – founded the ruling dynasty of the Kushan Empire.\n\nThe Kushan Empire initially retained the Greek language for administrative purposes, but soon began to use Bactrian. The Bactrian Rabatak inscription (discovered in 1993 and deciphered in 2000) records that the Kushan king Kanishka (c. 127 AD) discarded Greek (Ionian) as the language of administration and adopted Bactrian (\"Arya language\"). The Greek language accordingly vanished from official use and only Bactrian was later attested. The Greek script however remained and was used to write Bactrian.\n\nThe territorial expansion of the Kushans helped propagate Bactrian in other parts of Central Asia and North India.\n\nIn the 3rd century, the Kushan territories west of the Indus river fell to the Sasanians, and Bactrian began to be influenced by Middle Persian. Next to Pahlavi script and (occasionally) Brahmi script, some coinage of this period is still in Greco-Bactrian script. Beginning in the mid-4th century, Bactria and northwestern India yielded to the Hephthalite tribes. The Hephthalite period is marked by linguistic diversity and in addition to Bactrian, Middle Persian, North Indo-Aryan, Turkish and Latin vocabulary is also attested. The Hephthalites ruled their territories until the 7th century when they were overrun by the Arabs, after which the official use of Bactrian ceased. Although Bactrian briefly survived in other usage, that too eventually ceased, and the latest examples of the language date to the end of the 9th century.\n\nAmong Indo-Iranian languages, the use of the Greek script is unique to Bactrian. Although ambiguities remain, some of the disadvantages were overcome by using \"heta\" (Ͱ, ͱ) for /h/ and by introducing \"sho\" (Ϸ, ϸ) to represent /ʃ/. \"Xi\" (Ξ, ξ) and \"psi\" (Ψ, ψ) were not used for writing Bactrian as the \"ks\" and \"ps\" sequences do not occur in Bactrian. They were however probably used to represent numbers (just as other Greek letters were).\n\nThe Bactrian language is known from inscriptions, coins, seals, manuscripts, and other documents.\n\nSites at which Bactrian language inscriptions have been found are (in North-South order) Afrasiyab in Uzbekistan; Kara-Tepe, Airtam, Delbarjin, Balkh, Kunduz, Baglan, Ratabak/Surkh Kotal, Oruzgan, Kabul, Dasht-e Navur, Ghazni, Jagatu in Afghanistan; and Islamabad, Shatial Bridge and Tochi Valley in Pakistan. \nOver 150 legal documents, accounts, letters and Buddhist texts have surfaced since the 1990s, several of them currently a part of the collection of Nasser Khalili. These have greatly increased the detail in which Bactrian is currently known.\n\nThe phonology of Bactrian is not known with certainty, due to the limitations of the native scripts.\nA major difficulty in determining Bactrian phonology is that affricates and voiced stops were not consistently distinguished from the corresponding fricatives in the Greek script.\n\nThe status of \"θ\" is unclear; it only appears in the word \"ιθαο\" 'thus, also', which may be a loanword from another Iranian language. In most positions Proto-Iranian *θ becomes (written \"υ\"), or is lost, e.g. *puθra- > \"πουρο\" 'son'. The cluster *θw, however, appears to become , e.g. *wikāθwan > \"οιγαλφο\" 'witness'.\n\n\"ϸ\" continues, in addition to Proto-Iranian *š, also Proto-Iranian *s in the clusters *sr, *str, *rst. In several cases Proto-Iranian *š however becomes or is lost; the distribution is unclear. E.g. *snušā > \"ασνωυο\" 'daughter-in-law', *aštā > \"αταο\" 'eight', *xšāθriya > \"χαρο\" 'ruler', *pašman- > \"παμανο\" 'wool'.\n\nThe Greek script does not consistently represent vowel length. Fewer vowel contrasts yet are found in the Manichaean script, but short and long are distinguished in it, suggesting that Bactrian generally retains the Proto-Iranian vowel length contrast.\n\nIt is not clear if \"ο\" might represent short in addition to , and if any contrast existed. Short may have occurred at least as a reflex of *a followed by a lost *u in the next syllable, e.g. *madu > \"μολο\" 'wine', *pasu > \"ποσο\" 'sheep'. Short is also rare. By contrast, long , are well established as reflexes of Proto-Iranian diphthongs and certain vowel-semivowel sequences: \"η\" < *ai, *aya, *iya; \"ω\" < *au, *awa.\n\nAn epenthetic vowel (written \"α\") is inserted before word-initial consonant clusters.\n\nOriginal word-final vowels and word-initial vowels in open syllables were generally lost. A word-final \"ο\" is normally written, but this was probably silent, and it is appended even after retained word-final vowels: e.g. *aštā > \"αταο\" 'eight', likely pronounced .\n\nThe Proto-Iranian syllabic rhotic *r̥ is lost in Bactrian, and is reflected as \"ορ\" adjacent to labial consonants, \"ιρ\" elsewhere; this agrees with the development in the western Iranian languages Parthian and Middle Persian.\n\n\n"}

In Buginese, it is called while the Bugis people are called . is taken from the name to the first king of Cina, an ancient Bugis kingdom, \"La Sattumpugi.\" \"To Ugi\" basically means \"the followers of La Sattumpugi\".\n\nLittle is known about the early history of this language due to the lack of written records. The earliest written record of this language is Sureq Galigo, the epic creation myth of the Bugis people.\n\nAnother written source of Buginese is Lontara, a term which refers to the traditional script and historical record as well. The earliest historical record of Lontara dates to around the 17th century, and being influenced by myths, is not considered a reliable historical source.\n\nPrior to the Dutch arrival in the 18th century, a missionary, B.F. Matthews, translated the Bible into Buginese, which made him the first European to acquire knowledge of the language. He was also one of the first Europeans to master Makassarese. The dictionaries and grammar books compiled by him, and the literature and folkfore texts he published, remain basic sources of information about both languages.\n\nUpon colonization by the Dutch, a number of Bugis fled from their home area of South Sulawesi seeking a better life. This led to the existence of small groups of Buginese speakers throughout Maritime Southeast Asia.\n\nBuginese belongs to South Sulawesi subgroup of the Austronesian language family. Within the South Sulawesi subgroup, it is most closely related to Campalagian.\n\nMost of the native speakers (around 3 million) are concentrated in South Sulawesi, Indonesia but there are small groups of Buginese speakers in the island of Java, Samarinda and east Sumatra of Indonesia, east Sabah and Malay Peninsula, Malaysia and South Philippines. This Bugis diaspora are the result of migration since 17th centuries that was mainly driven by continuous warfare situations. (The Dutch direct colonization started in early 20th century.)\n\nBuginese has six vowels: a, e, i, o, u, and the central vowel ə.\n\nThe following table gives the consonant phonemes of Buginese together with their representation in Lontara script.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> only occurs finally, and is therefore not written in Lontara.\n\nWhen Buginese is written in Latin script, general Indonesian spelling conventions are applied: [ŋ] is represented by ″ny″, [ŋ] by ″ng″, [ɟ] by ″j″, [j] by ″y″. The glottal stop [ʔ] is usually represented by an apostrophe (e.g. \"ana′\" [anaʔ] \"child\"), but occasionally \"q\" is also used.\n\nNote that /q/ represent a glottal stop. Therefore it is not written.\n\nThe following are grammatical aspects of the language:\n\nExample of usage:\n\nBuginese was traditionally written using the Lontara script, of the Brahmic family, which is also used for the Makassar language and the Mandar language. The name Lontara derives from the Malay word for the palmyra palm, , the leaves of which are the traditional material for manuscripts in India, South East Asia and Indonesia. Today, however, it is often written using the Latin script.\n\nThe Buginese lontara (locally known as ) has a slightly different pronunciation from the other lontaras like the Makassarese. Like other Indic scripts, it also utilizes diacritics to distinguish the vowels [i], [u], [e], [o] and [ə] from the default inherent vowel /a/ (actually pronounced [ɔ]) implicitly represented in all base consonant letters (including the zero-consonant \"a\").\n\nBut unlike most other Brahmic scripts of India, the Buginese script traditionally does not have any virama sign (or alternate half-form for vowel-less consonants, or subjoined form for non-initial consonants in clusters) to suppress the inherent vowel, so it is normally impossible to write consonant clusters (a few ones were added later, derived from ligatures, to mark the prenasalization), geminated consonants or final consonants.\n\nOlder texts, however, usually did not use diacritics at all, and readers were expected to identify words from context and thus provide the correct pronunciation. As one might expect, this led to erroneous readings; for example, could be misread as by new readers.\n\nThe Bugis still distinguish themselves according to their major precolony states (Bone, Wajo, Soppeng and Sidenreng) or groups of petty states (around Pare-Pare, Sinjai and Suppa.) The languages of these areas, with their relatively minor differences from one another, have been largely recognized by linguists as constituting dialects: recent linguistic research has identified eleven of them, most comprising two or more sub-dialects.\n\nThis is a partial list of Buginese dialects: Bone (Palakka, Dua Boccoe, Mare), Pangkep (Pangkajane), Camba, Sidrap (Sidenreng, North Pinrang, Alitta), Pasangkayu (Ugi Riawa), Sinjai (Enna, Palattae, Bulukumba), Soppeng (Kessi), Wajo, Barru (Pare-Pare, Nepo, Soppeng Riaja, Tompo, Tanete), Sawitto (Pinrang), Luwu (Luwu, Bua Ponrang, Wara, Malangke-Ussu).\n\nThe numbers are:\n\n\n"}

The various uses of 'Caesarism' are documented below. It has been used by proponents of it, but it has also been used in a pejorative manner.\n\nThe first documented use of the word is in the 19th century when it was used by German historian Johann Friedrich Böhmer in 1846 to describe the state subordinating the Church to its control. \n\nIn 1850 it was used again by Auguste Romieu but it had a different meaning. Romieu defined Caesarism as the rule of military warlords.\n\nSociologist Peter Baehr writes \"following Romieu's polemic \"Caesarism\"...[Caesarism] gained vogue status\". In 1857 religious writer Orestes Brownson used it to mean monarchical absolutism. In 1858 the Westminster Review wrote \"clumsy eulogies of Caesarism as incarnate in the dynasty of Bonaparte\"\n\nBenjamin Disraeli was accused of Caesarism in March 1878 when, in anticipation of war with Russia, he mobilised British reserves and called Indian troops to Malta. G. K. Chesterton made one of the most ringing denunciations of Caesarism in his work \"Heretics\", calling it \"the worst form of slavery\".\n\nSociologist Max Weber believed that every mass democracy went in a Caesarist direction. Professor of law Gerhard Casper writes \"Weber employed the term to stress, inter alia, the plebiscitary character of elections, disdain for parliament, the non-toleration of autonomous powers within the government and a failure to attract or suffer independent political minds.\"\n\nA so-called \"democratic\" form of Caesarism has been advocated by theorists like Venezuela's Laureano Vallenilla Lanz in \"Cesarismo Democrático\" (1919). The most famous person who themselves espoused Caesarism, was Napoleon Bonaparte, who admired and emulated Caesar during his rule in France. Italian \"Duce\" Benito Mussolini and the ideology of Italian Fascism espoused Caesarism.\n\n"}

{"id": "6753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6753", "title": "Clitic", "text": "Clitic\n\nA clitic (, backformed from Greek \"leaning\" or \"enclitic\") is a morpheme in morphology and syntax that has syntactic characteristics of a word, but depends phonologically on another word or phrase. In this sense, it is syntactically independent but phonologically dependent—always attached to a host. The term derives from the Greek for \"leaning\". A clitic is pronounced like an affix, but plays a syntactic role at the phrase level. In other words, clitics have the \"form\" of affixes, but the distribution of function words. For example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in \"I'm\" and \"we've\" are clitics.\n\nClitics can belong to any grammatical category, although they are commonly pronouns, determiners, or adpositions. Note that orthography is not always a good guide for distinguishing clitics from affixes: clitics may be written as separate words, but sometimes they are joined to the word they depend on (like the Latin clitic \"-que\", meaning \"and\"), or separated by special characters such as hyphens or apostrophes (like the English clitic \"’s\" in \"it's\" for \"it has\" or \"it is\").\n\nClitics fall into various categories depending on their position in relation to the word they connect to.\n\nA proclitic appears before its host. It is common in Romance languages. For example, in French, there is \"il s'est réveillé\" (\"he woke up\"), or \"je t'aime\" (\"I love you\").\n\nAn enclitic appears after its host.\n\nA mesoclitic appears between the stem of the host and other affixes. For example, in Portuguese, \"conquistar-se-á\" (\"it will be conquered\"), \"dá-lo-ei\" (\"I will give it\"), \"matá-la-ia\" (\"he/she/it would kill her\"). These are found much more often in writing than in speech. It is even possible to use two pronouns inside the verb, as in \"dar-no-lo-á\" (\"he/she/it will give it to us\"), or \"dar-ta-ei\" (\"ta\" = \"te\" + \"a\", \"I will give it/her to you\"). As in other Romance languages, the Portuguese synthetic future tense comes from the merging of the infinitive and the corresponding finite forms of the verb \"haver\" (from Latin \"habēre\"), which explains the possibility of separating it from the infinitive.\n\nThe endoclitic splits apart the root and is inserted between the two pieces. Endoclitics defy the Lexical Integrity Hypothesis (or Lexicalist hypothesis) and so were long thought impossible. However, evidence from the Udi language suggests that they exist. Endoclitics are also found in Pashto and are reported to exist in Degema.\n\nOne important distinction divides the broad term 'clitics' into two categories, simple clitics and special clitics. This distinction is, however, disputed.\n\nSimple clitics are free morphemes, meaning they can stand alone in a phrase or sentence. They are unaccented and thus phonologically dependent upon a nearby word. They only derive meaning from this \"host\".\n\nSpecial clitics are morphemes that are bound to the word they are dependent upon, meaning they exist as a part of their host. This form, which is unaccented, represents a variant of a free form that does carry stress. While the two variants carry similar meaning and phonological makeup, the special clitic is bound to a host word and unaccented.\n\nSome clitics can be understood as elements undergoing a historical process of grammaticalization:\n\nlexical item → clitic → affix\n\nAccording to this model from Judith Klavans, an autonomous lexical item in a particular context loses the properties of a fully independent word over time and acquires the properties of a morphological affix (prefix, suffix, infix, etc.). At any intermediate stage of this evolutionary process, the element in question can be described as a \"clitic\". As a result, this term ends up being applied to a highly heterogeneous class of elements, presenting different combinations of word-like and affix-like properties.\n\nOne characteristic shared by many clitics is a lack of prosodic independence. A clitic attaches to an adjacent word, known as its \"host\". Orthographic conventions treat clitics in different ways: Some are written as separate words, some are written as one word with their hosts, and some are attached to their hosts, but set off by punctuation (a hyphen or an apostrophe, for example).\n\nAlthough the term \"clitic\" can be used descriptively to refer to any element whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of \"clitic\" as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: they cannot appear without a host, and they can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term \"postlexical clitic\" is used for this narrower sense of the term.\n\nGiven this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized by a lack of prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.\n\nAn affix syntactically and phonologically attaches to a base morpheme of a limited part of speech, such as a verb, to form a new word. A clitic syntactically functions above the word level, on the phrase or clause level, and attaches only phonetically to the first, last, or only word in the phrase or clause, whichever part of speech the word belongs to.\nThe results of applying these criteria sometimes reveal that elements that have traditionally been called \"clitics\" actually have the status of affixes (e.g., the Romance pronominal clitics discussed below).\n\nZwicky and Pullum postulated five characteristics that distinguish clitics from affixes:\nAn example of differing analyses by different linguists is the discussion of the possessive ('s) in English, some linguists treating it as an affix, while others treat it as a special clitic. \n\nSimilar to the discussion above, clitics must be distinguishable from words. Linguists have proposed a number of tests to differentiate between the two categories. Some tests, specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories, in the sense that they share certain properties. Six such tests are described below. These, of course, are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.\n\n\nClitics do not always appear next to the word or phrase that they are associated with grammatically. They may be subject to global word order constraints that act on the entire sentence. Many Indo-European languages, for example, obey Wackernagel's law (named after Jacob Wackernagel), which requires clitics to appear in \"second position\", after the first syntactic phrase or the first stressed word in a clause:\n\nEnglish enclitics include the contracted versions of auxiliary verbs, as in \"I'm\" and \"we've\". Some also regard the possessive marker, as in \"The Queen of England's crown\" as an enclitic, rather than a (phrasal) genitival inflection.\n\nSome consider the English articles \"a, an, the\" and the infinitive marker \"to\" proclitics.\n\nThe negative marker \"n’t\" as in \"couldn’t\" etc. is typically considered a clitic that developed from the lexical item \"not\". Linguists Arnold Zwicky and Geoffrey Pullum argue, however, that the form has the properties of an affix rather than a syntactically independent clitic.\n\n\nIn Romance languages, some feel the object personal pronoun forms are clitics. Others consider them affixes, as they only attach to the verb they are the object of. There is no general agreement on the issue. For the Spanish object pronouns, for example:\n\n\nColloquial European Portuguese allows object suffixes before the conditional and future suffixes of the verbs:\n\n\nColloquial Portuguese of Brazil and Portugal and Spanish of the former Gran Colombia allow ser to be conjugated as a verbal clitic adverbial adjunct to emphasize the importance of the phrase compared to its context, or with the meaning of \"really\" or \"in truth\":\n\n\nNote that this clitic form is only for the verb ser and is restricted to only third-person singular conjugations. It is not used as a verb in the grammar of the sentence but introduces prepositional phrases and adds emphasis. It does not need to concord with the tense of the main verb, as in the second example, and can be usually removed from the sentence without affecting the simple meaning.\n\nIn the Indo-European languages, some clitics can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European: for example, *\"\" is the original form of Sanskrit \"च\" (\"-ca\"), Greek \"τε\" (\"-te\"), and Latin \"-que\".\n\n\n\n"}

This problem was solved by the development of an electronic libretto system, which utilizes individual screens placed on the back of each seat, thus allowing patrons either to view a translation or to switch them off during the performance.\n\nAlthough initially developed by technicians at The Santa Fe Opera, the Metropolitan Opera was the first to install the system which they describe as \"Met Titles\". In the US, the electronic libretto system was further developed and patented as \"Simultext\" by Figaro Systems of Santa Fe, New Mexico with The Santa Fe Opera becoming the second house to adopt it in 1999 after its 1997/98 refurbishment. \n\nOpera houses such as the Valencia Opera House, the National Noh Theatre in Tokyo, the Vienna State Opera in Vienna, the Liceu in Barcelona, the Royal Opera House in London and the Teatro degli Arcimboldi and La Scala (both in Milan) have added the electronic titles, the latter providing English and Italian translations in addition to the original language of the opera.\n\nOther companies have developed similar technologies, such as Sonoidea in Spain, Visutech in Denmark, Radio Marconi in Italy, 3Com in US and Rokko Denki in Japan.\n\nIn the United States, various of these systems are now to be found at the Miami's Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, Ellie Caulkins Opera House in Denver, Colorado, at the Des Moines Metro Opera, the Seattle Opera, Lyric Opera of Kansas City, and in the Roy O. Disney Theatre, a part of the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nThis technology, which costs about $1,000 per seat, has been added or planned for during initial construction (as was the case with Santa Fe where it was added one year after the opening of the third opera house in 1998) or during planned renovation (as with La Scala during its two-year closure period). The installations of the Met, La Scala and the Arcimboldi, the Vienna State Opera, Liceu, and the Royal Opera House were possible with the donations of the philanthropist Alberto Vilar, at the time a majority shareholder of Figaro Systems. \n\nToday, a new trend is the Radio Marconi multimedia patented interactive electronic libretto technology, installed in 2011 in the Royal Opera House Muscat, Sultanate of Oman and in 2013 at the Musiktheater Linz, Austria. The event on stage become an interactive and multimedia experience that has the power to capture the audience's attention and involve people in the show. The audience can decide to view videos, texts, theatre information, surveys, or ask for assistance just by touching his/her personal screen. The video area will display the chosen content and, in the text multilanguage area, the related information appears as well as personal messages. This technology is able to shift the problem of the installation cost per seat to the revenue generation per seat thanks to its embedded marketing, donation and merchandising features.\n\nRadio marconi\n\nNotes\n"}
{"id": "7546127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7546127", "title": "Freemium", "text": "Freemium\n\nFreemium is a pricing strategy by which a product or service (typically a digital offering or an application such as software, media, games or web services) is provided free of charge, but money (premium) is charged for additional features, services, or virtual (online) or physical (offline) goods. \"Freemium\" is a portmanteau of the words \"free\" and \"premium\". The business model has been in use by the software industry since the 1980s as a licensing scheme. A subset of this model used by the video game industry is called free-to-play.\n\nThe business model has been in use for software since the 1980s. This is often in a time-limited or feature-limited version to promote a paid-for full version. The model is particularly suited to software as the cost of distribution is negligible. Thus little is lost by giving away free software licenses as long as significant cannibalization is avoided. The term \"freemium\" to describe this model appears to have been created only much later, in response to a 2006 blog post by venture capitalist Fred Wilson summarizing the model:Give your service away for free, possibly ad supported but maybe not, acquire a lot of customers very efficiently through word of mouth, referral networks, organic search marketing, etc., then offer premium priced value added services or an enhanced version of your service to your customer base.Jarid Lukin of Alacra, one of Wilson's portfolio companies, then suggested the term \"freemium\" for this model. \n\nIn 2009, Chris Anderson published the book \"Free\", which examines the popularity of this business model. As well as for traditional software and services, it is now also often used by Web 2.0 and open source companies. In 2014, Eric Seufert published the book \"Freemium Economics\", which attempts to deconstruct the economic principles of the freemium model and prescribe a framework for implementing them into software products.\n\nThe freemium model is closely related to tiered services. It has become a popular model, with notable examples including LinkedIn, Badoo, and in the form of a \"soft\" paywall, such as those employed by \"The New York Times\" and by Press+. A freemium model is sometimes used to build a consumer base when the marginal cost of producing extra units is low.\n\nIn the US, in the Christian 501 (c) 3 religious education sector, Christian Leaders Institute (CLI) uses the freemium model to train Christian leaders. CLI offers free training to individuals, who receive \"unofficial\" certificates, diplomas and degrees at no charge. The infrastructure cost to provide this training and these \"unofficial\" awards is supported by donations to the mission, which receive tax deductions in the United States. If CLI students want official awards, they are required to make minimal \"non-tax deductible\" donations that cover the costs of individual processing, verification, and delivery. \n\nOther examples include free-to-play games – video games that can be downloaded without paying. Video game publishers of free-to-play games rely on other means to generate revenue – such as optional in-game virtual items that can be purchased by players to enhance game-play or aesthetics.\n\nWays in which the product or service may be restricted in the free version include:\n\nSome software and services make all of the features available for free for a trial period and then at the end of that period revert to operating as a feature-limited free version (e.g. Online Armor Personal Firewall). The user can unlock the premium features on payment of a license fee, as per the freemium model. Some businesses use a variation of the model known as \"open core\", in which the unsupported, feature-limited free version is also open-source software, but versions with additional features and official support are commercial software.\n\nIn June 2011, \"PC World\" reported that traditional anti-virus software had started to lose market share to freemium anti-virus products. By September 2012, all but two of the 50 highest-grossing apps in the Games section of Apple's iTunes App Store supported in-app purchases, leading \"Wired\" to conclude that game developers were now required to choose between including such purchases or foregoing a very substantial revenue stream. Beginning in 2013, the digital distribution platform Steam began to add numerous Free to play and Early Access games to its library, many of which utilized Freemium marketing for their in-game economies. Due to criticism that the multiplayer games falling under this were \"pay to win\" in nature or were low-quality and never finished development, Valve Corporation has since added stricter rules to its Early Access and Free-to-play policies.\n\nFreemium games have come under criticism from players and critics. Many are labelled with the derogatory term 'Pay2Win', a term which criticizes freemium games for giving an advantage to players who pay more money as opposed to those who have more skill. Criticisms also extend to the way that the business model can often appear unregulated, to the point of encouraging prolific spending. \n\nAn example of this is \"Smurfs' Village\", which was released by Capcom as a free game tied in with the release of the 2011 film. The game was very popular, at one point overtaking \"Angry Birds\" as the top-downloaded app on the Apple iOS App Store. The game had the player buy characters and buildings using in-game currency, but more currency could be purchased with real money using account details tied to the device, using Apple's store authentication prior to purchase. Prior to changes Apple made in 2011, it was possible to use the authentication for up to fifteen minutes before having to reconfirm the password, and parents had soon found that their children had used this to unwittingly incur hundreds of US dollars in charges by playing the game. A group of parents filed suit against Apple to change their practice in microtransactions to prevent this from happening in other freemium games.\n\nIn November, 2014, the sixth episode of Season 18 of the animated TV series \"South Park\" aired an episode entitled \"Freemium Isn’t Free.\" The episode satirized the business model for encouraging predatory game design tactics based on an improper business model. In 2015, Nintendo released two of their own freemium games in the \"Pokémon\" series based on other standalone purchasable titles. Nintendo has taken a different approach with freemium games by making it possible to complete the entire game without buying premium credits, having that as an option so players can proceed through the game at a pace that suits them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14848", "title": "Indo-European languages", "text": "Indo-European languages\n\nThere are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \"Ethnologue\", with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), English, Portuguese, Bengali, Punjabi, and Russian, each with over 100 million speakers, with German, French, Marathi, Italian, and Persian also having more than 50 million. Today, nearly 42% of the human population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family.\n\nThe Indo-European family includes most of the modern languages of Europe; notable exceptions include Hungarian, Turkish, Finnish, Estonian, Basque, Maltese, and Sami. The Indo-European family is also represented in Asia with the exception of East and Southeast Asia. It was predominant in ancient Anatolia (present-day Turkey), the ancient Tarim Basin (present-day Northwest China) and most of Central Asia until the medieval Turkic and Mongol invasions. Outside Eurasia, Indo-European languages are dominant in the Americas and much of Oceania and Africa, having reached there during the Age of Discovery. \n\nWith written evidence appearing since the Bronze Age in the form of the Anatolian languages and Mycenaean Greek, the Indo-European family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as possessing the second-longest recorded history, after the Afroasiatic family, although certain language isolates, such as Sumerian, Elamite, Hurrian, Hattian, and Kassite are recorded earlier.\n\nAll Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, reconstructed as Proto-Indo-European, spoken sometime in the Neolithic era. Although no written records remain, aspects of the culture and religion of the Proto-Indo-Europeans can also be reconstructed from the related cultures of ancient and modern Indo-European speakers who continue to live in areas to where the Proto-Indo-Europeans migrated from their original homeland. Several disputed proposals link Indo-European to other major language families. Although they are written in Semitic Old Assyrian, the Hittite loanwords and names found in the Kültepe texts are the oldest record of any Indo-European language.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the linguistic concept of Indo-European languages was frequently used interchangeably with the racial concepts of Aryan and Japhetite.\n\nIn the 16th century, European visitors to the Indian subcontinent began to notice similarities among Indo-Aryan, Iranian, and European languages. In 1583, English Jesuit missionary and Konkani scholar Thomas Stephens wrote a letter from Goa to his brother (not published until the 20th century) in which he noted similarities between Indian languages and Greek and Latin.\n\nAnother account was made by Filippo Sassetti, a merchant born in Florence in 1540, who travelled to the Indian subcontinent. Writing in 1585, he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian (these included \"devaḥ\"/\"dio\" \"God\", \"sarpaḥ\"/\"serpe\" \"serpent\", \"sapta\"/\"sette\" \"seven\", \"aṣṭa\"/\"otto\" \"eight\", and \"nava\"/\"nove\" \"nine\"). However, neither Stephens' nor Sassetti's observations led to further scholarly inquiry.\n\nIn 1647, Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn noted the similarity among certain Asian and European languages and theorized that they were derived from a primitive common language which he called \"Scythian\". He included in his hypothesis Dutch, Albanian, Greek, Latin, Persian, and German, later adding Slavic, Celtic, and Baltic languages. However, Van Boxhorn's suggestions did not become widely known and did not stimulate further research.\n\nOttoman Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Vienna in 1665–1666 as part of a diplomatic mission and noted a few similarities between words in German and in Persian.\nGaston Coeurdoux and others made observations of the same type. Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit, Latin and Greek conjugations in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship among them. Meanwhile, Mikhail Lomonosov compared different language groups, including Slavic, Baltic (\"Kurlandic\"), Iranian (\"Medic\"), Finnish, Chinese, \"Hottentot\" (Khoekhoe), and others, noting that related languages (including Latin, Greek, German and Russian) must have separated in antiquity from common ancestors.\n\nThe hypothesis reappeared in 1786 when Sir William Jones first lectured on the striking similarities among three of the oldest languages known in his time: Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit, to which he tentatively added Gothic, Celtic, and Persian, though his classification contained some inaccuracies and omissions. In one of the most famous quotations in linguistics, Jones made the following prescient statement in a lecture to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1786, conjecturing the existence of an earlier ancestor language, which he called \"a common source\" but did not name:\nThomas Young first used the term \"Indo-European\" in 1813, deriving from the geographical extremes of the language family: from Western Europe to North India. A synonym is \"Indo-Germanic\" (\"Idg.\" or \"IdG.\"), specifying the family's southeasternmost and northwesternmost branches. This first appeared in French (\"indo-germanique\") in 1810 in the work of Conrad Malte-Brun; in most languages this term is now dated or less common than \"Indo-European\", although in German \"indogermanisch\" remains the standard scientific term. A number of other synonymous terms have also been used.\n\nFranz Bopp wrote in 1816 \"On the conjugational system of the Sanskrit language compared with that of Greek, Latin, Persian and Germanic\" and between 1833 and 1852 he wrote \"Comparative Grammar\". This marks the beginning of Indo-European studies as an academic discipline. The classical phase of Indo-European comparative linguistics leads from this work to August Schleicher's 1861 \"Compendium\" and up to Karl Brugmann's \"Grundriss\", published in the 1880s. Brugmann's neogrammarian reevaluation of the field and Ferdinand de Saussure's development of the laryngeal theory may be considered the beginning of \"modern\" Indo-European studies. The generation of Indo-Europeanists active in the last third of the 20th century (such as Calvert Watkins, Jochem Schindler, and Helmut Rix) developed a better understanding of morphology and of ablaut in the wake of Kuryłowicz's 1956 \"Apophony in Indo-European,\" who in 1927 pointed out the existence of the Hittite consonant ḫ. Kuryłowicz's discovery supported Ferdinand de Saussure's 1879 proposal of the existence of \"coefficients sonantiques\", elements de Saussure reconstructed to account for vowel length alternations in Indo-European languages. This led to the so-called laryngeal theory, a major step forward in Indo-European linguistics and a confirmation of de Saussure's theory.\n\nThe various subgroups of the Indo-European language family include ten major branches, listed below in alphabetical order\n\n\nIn addition to the classical ten branches listed above, several extinct and little-known languages and language-groups have existed:\n\nMembership of languages in the Indo-European language family is determined by genealogical relationships, meaning that all members are presumed descendants of a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-European. Membership in the various branches, groups and subgroups of Indo-European is also genealogical, but here the defining factors are \"shared innovations\" among various languages, suggesting a common ancestor that split off from other Indo-European groups. For example, what makes the Germanic languages a branch of Indo-European is that much of their structure and phonology can be stated in rules that apply to all of them. Many of their common features are presumed innovations that took place in Proto-Germanic, the source of all the Germanic languages.\n\nThe \"tree model\" is considered an appropriate representation of the genealogical history of a language family if communities do not remain in contact after their languages have started to diverge. In this case, subgroups defined by shared innovations form a nested pattern. The tree model is not appropriate in cases where languages remain in contact as they diversify; in such cases subgroups may overlap, and the \"wave model\" is a more accurate representation. Most approaches to Indo-European subgrouping to date have assumed that the tree model is by-and-large valid for Indo-European; however, there is also a long tradition of wave-model approaches.\n\nIn addition to genealogical changes, many of the early changes in Indo-European languages can be attributed to language contact. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be areal features. More certainly, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of long vowels in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a proto-language innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as \"areal\", either, because English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar innovations in Germanic and Balto-Slavic that are far more likely areal features than traceable to a common proto-language, such as the uniform development of a high vowel (*\"u\" in the case of Germanic, *\"i/u\" in the case of Baltic and Slavic) before the PIE syllabic resonants *\"ṛ,* ḷ, *ṃ, *ṇ\", unique to these two groups among IE languages, which is in agreement with the wave model. The Balkan sprachbund even features areal convergence among members of very different branches.\n\nUsing an extension to the \"Ringe-Warnow model of language evolution\", early IE was confirmed to have featured limited contact between distinct lineages, whereas only the Germanic subfamily exhibited a less treelike behaviour as it acquired some characteristics from neighbours early in its evolution rather than from its direct ancestors. The internal diversification of especially West Germanic is cited to have been radically non-treelike.\n\nSpecialists have postulated the existence of higher-order subgroups such as Italo-Celtic, Graeco-Armenian, Graeco-Aryan or Graeco-Armeno-Aryan, and Balto-Slavo-Germanic. However, unlike the ten traditional branches, these are all controversial to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nThe Italo-Celtic subgroup was at one point uncontroversial, considered by Antoine Meillet to be even better established than Balto-Slavic. The main lines of evidence included the genitive suffix \"-ī\"; the superlative suffix \"-m̥mo\"; the change of /p/ to /kʷ/ before another /kʷ/ in the same word (as in \"penkʷe\" > \"*kʷenkʷe\" > Latin \"quīnque\", Old Irish \"cóic\"); and the subjunctive morpheme \"-ā-\". This evidence was prominently challenged by Calvert Watkins; while Michael Weiss has argued for the subgroup.\n\nEvidence for a relationship between Greek and Armenian includes the regular change of the second laryngeal to \"a\" at the beginnings of words, as well as terms for \"woman\" and \"sheep\". Greek and Indo-Iranian share innovations mainly in verbal morphology and patterns of nominal derivation. Relations have also been proposed between Phrygian and Greek, and between Thracian and Armenian. Some fundamental shared features, like the aorist (a verb form denoting action without reference to duration or completion) having the perfect active particle -s fixed to the stem, link this group closer to Anatolian languages and Tocharian. Shared features with Balto-Slavic languages, on the other hand (especially present and preterit formations), might be due to later contacts.\n\nThe Indo-Hittite hypothesis proposes that the Indo-European language family consists of two main branches: one represented by the Anatolian languages and another branch encompassing all other Indo-European languages. Features that separate Anatolian from all other branches of Indo-European (such as the gender or the verb system) have been interpreted alternately as archaic debris or as innovations due to prolonged isolation. Points proffered in favour of the Indo-Hittite hypothesis are the (non-universal) Indo-European agricultural terminology in Anatolia and the preservation of laryngeals. However, in general this hypothesis is considered to attribute too much weight to the Anatolian evidence. According to another view, the Anatolian subgroup left the Indo-European parent language comparatively late, approximately at the same time as Indo-Iranian and later than the Greek or Armenian divisions. A third view, especially prevalent in the so-called French school of Indo-European studies, holds that extant similarities in non-satem languages in general—including Anatolian—might be due to their peripheral location in the Indo-European language-area and to early separation, rather than indicating a special ancestral relationship. Hans J. Holm, based on lexical calculations, arrives at a picture roughly replicating the general scholarly opinion and refuting the Indo-Hittite hypothesis.\n\nThe division of the Indo-European languages into satem and centum groups was put forward by Peter von Bradke in 1890, although Karl Brugmann had proposed a similar type of division in 1886. In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European palatovelars remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the \"plain velars\". In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for \"hundred\" in Avestan (\"satem\") and Latin (\"centum\")—the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative [s] in the former, but became an ordinary velar [k] in the latter.\n\nRather than being a genealogical separation, the centum–satem division is commonly seen as resulting from innovative changes that spread across PIE dialect-branches over a particular geographical area; the centum–satem isogloss intersects a number of other isoglosses that mark distinctions between features in the early IE branches. It may be that the centum branches in fact reflect the original state of affairs in PIE, and only the satem branches shared a set of innovations, which affected all but the peripheral areas of the PIE dialect continuum. Kortlandt proposes that the ancestors of Balts and Slavs took part in satemization before being drawn later into the western Indo-European sphere.\n\nSome linguists propose that Indo-European languages form part of one of several hypothetical macrofamilies. However, these theories remain highly controversial, not being accepted by most linguists in the field. Some of the smaller proposed macrofamilies include:\n\n\nOther, greater proposed families including Indo-European languages, include:\n\n\nObjections to such groupings are not based on any theoretical claim about the likely historical existence or non-existence of such macrofamilies; it is entirely reasonable to suppose that they might have existed. The serious difficulty lies in identifying the details of actual relationships between language families, because it is very hard to find concrete evidence that transcends chance resemblance, or is not equally likely explained as being due to borrowing (including Wanderwörter, which can travel very long distances). Because the signal-to-noise ratio in historical linguistics declines steadily over time, at great enough time-depths it becomes open to reasonable doubt that one can even distinguish between signal and noise.\n\nThe proposed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the hypothetical common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the Proto-Indo-Europeans. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE. Using the method of internal reconstruction an earlier stage, called Pre-Proto-Indo-European, has been proposed.\n\nPIE was an inflected language, in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The roots of PIE are basic morphemes carrying a lexical meaning. By addition of suffixes, they form stems, and by addition of endings, these form grammatically inflected words (nouns or verbs). The hypothetical Indo-European verb system is complex and, like the noun, exhibits a system of ablaut.\n\nThe diversification of the parent language into the attested branches of daughter languages is historically unattested. The timeline of the evolution of the various daughter languages, on the other hand, is mostly undisputed, quite regardless of the question of Indo-European origins.\n\nUsing a mathematical analysis borrowed from evolutionary biology, Don Ringe and Tandy Warnow propose the following evolutionary tree of Indo-European branches:\n\nDavid Anthony proposes the following sequence:\n\nFrom 1500 BC the following sequence may be given:\n\nIn reconstructing the history of the Indo-European languages and the form of the Proto-Indo-European language, some languages have been of particular importance. These generally include the ancient Indo-European languages that are both well-attested and documented at an early date, although some languages from later periods are important if they are particularly linguistically conservative (most notably, Lithuanian). Early poetry is of special significance because of the rigid poetic meter normally employed, which makes it possible to reconstruct a number of features (e.g. vowel length) that were either unwritten or corrupted in the process of transmission down to the earliest extant written manuscripts.\n\nMost noticeable of all:\n\nOther primary sources:\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to poor attestation:\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to extensive phonological changes and relatively limited attestation:\n\nAs the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language broke up, its sound system diverged as well, changing according to various sound laws evidenced in the daughter languages.\n\nPIE is normally reconstructed with a complex system of 15 stop consonants, including an unusual three-way phonation (voicing) distinction between voiceless, voiced and \"voiced aspirated\" (i.e. breathy voiced) stops, and a three-way distinction among velar consonants (\"k\"-type sounds) between \"palatal\" \"ḱ ǵ ǵh\", \"plain velar\" \"k g gh\" and labiovelar \"kʷ gʷ gʷh\". (The correctness of the terms \"palatal\" and \"plain velar\" is disputed; see Proto-Indo-European phonology.) All daughter languages have reduced the number of distinctions among these sounds, often in divergent ways.\n\nAs an example, in English, one of the Germanic languages, the following are some of the major changes that happened:\nNone of the daughter-language families (except possibly Anatolian, particularly Luvian) reflect the plain velar stops differently from the other two series, and there is even a certain amount of dispute whether this series existed at all in PIE. The major distinction between \"centum\" and \"satem\" languages corresponds to the outcome of the PIE plain velars:\n\nThe three-way PIE distinction between voiceless, voiced and voiced aspirated stops is considered extremely unusual from the perspective of linguistic typology—particularly in the existence of voiced aspirated stops without a corresponding series of voiceless aspirated stops. None of the various daughter-language families continue it unchanged, with numerous \"solutions\" to the apparently unstable PIE situation:\n\nAmong the other notable changes affecting consonants are:\n\nThe following table shows the basic outcomes of PIE consonants in some of the most important daughter languages for the purposes of reconstruction. For a fuller table, see Indo-European sound laws.\n\n\nThe following table presents a comparison of conjugations of the thematic present indicative of the verbal root * of the English verb \"to bear\" and its reflexes in various early attested IE languages and their modern descendants or relatives, showing that all languages had in the early stage an inflectional verb system.\n\nWhile similarities are still visible between the modern descendants and relatives of these ancient languages, the differences have increased over time. Some IE languages have moved from synthetic verb systems to largely periphrastic systems. In addition, the pronouns of periphrastic forms are in brackets when they appear. Some of these verbs have undergone a change in meaning as well.\n\nToday, Indo-European languages are spoken by almost 3 billion native speakers across all inhabited continents, the largest number by far for any recognised language family. Of the 20 languages with the largest numbers of native speakers according to \"Ethnologue\", 10 are Indo-European: Spanish, English, Hindustani, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Punjabi, German, French and Marathi, accounting for over 1.7 billion native speakers. Additionally, hundreds of millions of persons worldwide study Indo-European languages as secondary or tertiary languages, including in cultures which have completely different language families and historical backgrounds—there between 600,000,000 and one billion L2 learners of English alone.\n\nThe success of the language family, including the large number of speakers and the vast portions of the Earth that they inhabit, is due to several factors. The ancient Indo-European migrations and widespread dissemination of Indo-European culture throughout Eurasia, including that of the Proto-Indo-Europeans themselves, and that of their daughter cultures including the Indo-Aryans, Iranian peoples, Celts, Greeks, Romans, Germanic peoples, and Slavs, led to these peoples' branches of the language family already taking a dominant foothold in virtually all of Eurasia except for North and East Asia by the end of the prehistoric era, replacing the previously-spoken pre-Indo-European languages of this extensive area.\n\nDespite being unaware of their common linguistic origin, diverse groups of Indo-European speakers continued to culturally dominate and replace the indigenous languages of the western two-thirds of Eurasia. By the beginning of the Common Era, Indo-European peoples controlled almost the entirety of this area: the Celts western and central Europe, the Romans southern Europe, the Germanic peoples northern Europe, the Slavs eastern Europe, the Iranian peoples the entirety of western and central Asia and parts of eastern Europe, and the Indo-Aryan peoples in the Indian subcontinent, with the Tocharians inhabiting the Indo-European frontier in western China. By the medieval period, only the Vasconic, Semitic, Dravidian, Caucasian and Uralic languages remained of the (relatively) indigenous languages of Europe and the western half of Asia.\n\nDespite medieval invasions by Eurasian nomads, a group to which the Proto-Indo-Europeans had once belonged, Indo-European expansion reached another peak in the early modern period with the dramatic increase in the population of the Indian subcontinent and European expansionism throughout the globe during the Age of Discovery, as well as the continued replacement and assimilation of surrounding non-Indo-European languages and peoples due to increased state centralization and nationalism. These trends compounded throughout the modern period due to the general global population growth and the results of European colonization of the Western Hemisphere and Oceania, leading to an explosion in the number of Indo-European speakers as well as the territories inhabited by them.\n\nDue to colonization and the modern dominance of Indo-European languages in the fields of global science, technology, education, finance, and sports, even many modern countries whose populations largely speak non-Indo-European languages have Indo-European languages as official languages, and the majority of the global population speaks at least one Indo-European language. The overwhelming majority of languages used on the Internet are Indo-European, with English continuing to lead the group; English in general has in many respects become the \"lingua franca\" of global communication.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although he has written extensively on metaphysics, epistemology, ancient philosophy, and meta-ethics, McDowell's most influential work has been in the philosophy of mind and philosophy of language. McDowell was one of three recipients of the 2010 Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Distinguished Achievement Award. and is a Fellow of both the American Academy of Arts & Sciences and the British Academy.\n\nMcDowell has, throughout his career, understood philosophy to be \"therapeutic\" and thereby to \"leave everything as it is\", which he understands to be a form of philosophical quietism (although he does not consider himself to be a \"quietist\"). The philosophical quietist believes that philosophy cannot make any explanatory comment about how, for example, thought and talk relate to the world but can, by offering re-descriptions of philosophically problematic cases, return the confused philosopher to a state of intellectual quietude. However, in defending this quietistic perspective McDowell has engaged with the work of leading contemporaries in such a way as to therapeutically dissolve what he takes to be philosophical error, while developing original and distinctive theses about language, mind and value. In each case, he has tried to resist the influence of what he regards as a misguided, reductive form of philosophical naturalism that dominates the work of his contemporaries, particularly in North America.\n\nMcDowell was born in Boksburg, South Africa and completed a B.A. at the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1963, he moved to New College, Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, where he earned another B.A. in 1965 and an M.A. in 1969. He taught at University College, Oxford from 1966 until 1986, when he joined the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, where he is now a University Professor. He has also been a visiting professor at many universities, including Harvard University, University of Michigan, and University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nMcDowell was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1983 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. In 2010 he received the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award in the Humanities.\n\nMcDowell delivered the John Locke Lectures in Philosophy at Oxford University in 1991 (these became his book \"Mind and World\".) He has also given the Woodbridge Lectures at Columbia University in 1997 and the Howison Lectures in Philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley in 2006. \n\nHe received an honorary degree from the University of Chicago in 2008\n\nMcDowell's earliest published work was in ancient philosophy, most notably including a translation of and commentary on Plato's \"Theaetetus\". In the 1970s he was active in the Davidsonian project of providing a semantic theory for natural language, co-editing (with Gareth Evans) a volume of essays entitled \"Truth and Meaning\". McDowell edited and published Evans's influential posthumous book \"The Varieties of Reference\" (1982).\n\nIn his early work, McDowell was very much involved both with the development of the Davidsonian semantic programme and with the internecine dispute between those who take the core of a theory that can play the role of a theory of meaning to involve the grasp of truth conditions, and those, such as Michael Dummett, who argued that linguistic understanding must, at its core, involve the grasp of assertion conditions. If, Dummett argued, the core of a theory that is going to do duty for a theory of a meaning is supposed to represent a speaker's understanding, then that understanding must be something of which a speaker can manifest a grasp. McDowell argued, against this Dummettian view and its development by such contemporaries as Crispin Wright, both that this claim did not, as Dummett supposed, represent a Wittgensteinian requirement on a theory of meaning and that it rested on a suspect asymmetry between the evidence for the expressions of mind in the speech of others and the thoughts so expressed. This particular argument reflects McDowell's wider commitment to the idea that, when we understand others, we do so from \"inside\" our own practices: Wright and Dummett are treated as pushing the claims of explanation too far and as continuing Willard Van Orman Quine's project of understanding linguistic behaviour from an \"external\" perspective.\n\nIn these early exchanges and in the parallel debate over the proper understanding of Wittgenstein's remarks on rule-following, some of McDowell's characteristic intellectual stances were formed: to borrow a Wittgensteinian expression, the defence of a realism without empiricism, an emphasis on the human limits of our aspiration to objectivity, the idea that meaning and mind can be directly manifested in the action, particularly linguistic action, of other people, and a distinctive disjunctive theory of perceptual experience.\n\nThe latter is an account of perceptual experience, developed at the service of McDowell's realism, in which it is denied that the argument from illusion supports an indirect or representative theory of perception as that argument presupposes that there is a \"highest common factor\" shared by veridical and illusory (or, more accurately, delusive) experiences. (There is clearly a distinction between perceiving and acquiring a belief: one can see an \"apparently bent\" stick in the water but not believe that it is bent as one knows that one's experience is illusory. In illusions, you need not believe that things are as the illusory experiences represent them as being; in delusions, a person believes what their experience represents to them. So the argument from illusion is better described as an argument from delusion if it is to make its central point.)\n\nIn the classic argument from illusion (delusion) you are asked to compare a case where you succeed in perceiving, say, a cat on a mat, to the case where a trick of light deceives you and form the belief that the cat is on the mat, when it is not. The proponent of the argument then says that the two states of mind in these contrasting cases share something important in common, and to characterise this we need to introduce an idea like that of \"sense data.\" Acquaintance with such data is the \"highest common factor\" across the two cases. That seems to force us into a concession that our knowledge of the external world is indirect and mediated via such sense data. McDowell strongly resists this argument: he does not deny that there is something psychologically in common between the subject who really sees the cat and the one that fails to do so. But that psychological commonality has no bearing on the status of the judger's state of mind from the point of view of assessing whether she is in a position to acquire knowledge. In favourable conditions, experience can be such as to make manifest the presence of objects to observers – that is perceptual knowledge. When we succeed in knowing something by perceiving it, experience does not fall short of the fact known. But this just shows that a successful and a failed perceptual thought have nothing interesting in common from the point of view of appraising them as knowledge.\n\nIn this claim that a veridical perception and a non-veridical perception share no highest common factor, a theme is visible which runs throughout McDowell's work, namely, a commitment to seeing thoughts as essentially individuable only in their social and physical environment, so called externalism about the mental. McDowell defends, in addition to a general externalism about the mental, a specific thesis about the understanding of demonstrative expressions as involving so-called \"singular\" or \"Russellian\" thoughts about particular objects that reflects the influence on his views of Gareth Evans. According to this view, if the putative object picked out by the demonstrative does not exist, then such an object dependent thought cannot exist – it is, in the most literal sense, not available to be thought.\n\nIn parallel with the development of this work on mind and language, McDowell also made significant contributions to moral philosophy, specifically meta-ethical debates over the nature of moral reasons and moral objectivity. McDowell developed the view that has come to be known as secondary property realism, or sensibility or moral sense theory. The theory proceeds via the device of an ideally virtuous agent: such an agent has two connected capacities. She has the right concepts and the correct grasp of concepts to think about situations in which she finds herself by coming to moral beliefs. Secondly, for such a person such moral beliefs are automatically over-riding over other reasons she may have and in a particular way: they \"silence\" other reasons, as McDowell puts it. He believes that this is the best way to capture the traditional idea that moral reasons are specially authoritative.\n\nMcDowell also here departs from the standard interpretation of the Humean theory of how action is motivated. The Humean claims that any intentional action, hence any moral action, is motivated by a combination of two mental states, one a belief and one a desire. The belief functions as a passive representation; the desire functions to supply the distinctively motivational part of the combination. On the basis of his account of the virtuous moral agent, McDowell follows Thomas Nagel in rejecting this account as inaccurate: it is more truthful to say that in the case of a moral action, the virtuous agent's perception of the circumstances (that is, her belief) itself justifies both the action and the desire. For example, we cannot understand the desire, as a Humean original existence, without relating it back to the circumstances that impinged on the agent and made her feel compelled to act. So while the Humean thesis may be a truth about explanation it is not true about the structure of justification and it ought to be replaced by Nagel's motivated desire theory as set out in his \"The Possibility of Altruism\" (Oxford University Press, 1970).\n\nImplicit in this account is a theory of the metaphysical status of values: moral agents form beliefs about the moral facts, which can be straightforwardly true or false. However, the facts themselves, like facts about colour experience, combine anthropocentricity with realism. Values are not there in the world for any observer, for example, one without our human interest in morality. However, in that sense, colours are not in the world either, but one cannot deny that colours are both present in our experience and needed for good explanations in our common sense understanding of the world. The test for the reality of a property is whether it is used in judgements for which there are developed standards of rational argument and whether they are needed to explain aspects of our experience that are otherwise inexplicable. McDowell thinks that moral properties pass both of these tests. There are established standards of rational argument and moral properties fall into the general class of those properties that are both anthropocentric but real.\n\nThe connection between McDowell's general metaphysics and this particular claim about moral properties is that all claims about objectivity are to be made from the internal perspective of our actual practices, the part of his view that he takes from the later Wittgenstein. There is no standpoint from outside our best theories of thought and language from which we can classify secondary properties as \"second grade\" or \"less real\" than the properties described, for example, by a mature science such as physics. Characterising the place of values in our worldview is not, in McDowell's view, to downgrade them as less real than talk of quarks or the Higgs boson.\n\nThe later development of McDowell's work came more strongly to reflect the influence on him of Rorty and Sellars and, in particular, both \"Mind and World\" and McDowell's later Woodbridge lectures focus on a broadly Kantian understanding of intentionality, of the mind's capacity to represent. \"Mind and World\" sets itself the task of understanding the sense in which we are active even in our perceptual experience of the world. Influenced by Sellars's famous diagnosis of the \"myth of the given\" in traditional empiricism, in which Sellars argued that the blankly causal impingement of the external world on judgement failed to supply justification, as only something with a belief-like conceptual structure could engage with rational justification, McDowell tries to explain how one can accept that we are passive in our perceptual experience of the world while active in how we conceptualise it. McDowell develops an account of that which Kant called the \"spontaneity\" of our judgement in perceptual experience, while trying to avoid the suggestion that the resulting account has any connection with idealism.\n\n\"Mind and World\" rejects, in the course of its argument, the position that McDowell takes to be the working ideology of most of his philosophical contemporaries, namely, a reductively naturalistic account that McDowell labels \"bald naturalism.\" He contrasts this view with what he deems to be his own \"naturalistic\" perspective in which the distinctive capacities of mind are a cultural achievement of our \"second nature\", an idea that he adapts from Gadamer. The book concludes with a critique of Quine's narrow conception of empirical experience and also a critique of Donald Davidson's views on belief as inherently veridical, in which Davidson plays the role of the pure coherentist.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of McDowell's later work is his denial that there is any philosophical use for an idea that our experience contains representations that are not conceptually structured, so-called \"non-conceptual content.\" Given that other philosophers claim that scientific accounts of our mental lives, particularly in the cognitive sciences, need this idea, this claim of McDowell's has provoked a great deal of discussion. McDowell develops a stringent reading of Sellars' diagnosis of a \"myth of the given\" in perceptual experience to argue that we need always to separate out the exercise of concepts in experience from a causal account of the pre-conditions of experience and that the idea of \"non-conceptual content\" straddles this boundary in a philosophically unacceptable way.\n\nWhile \"Mind and World\" represents an important contemporary development of a Kantian approach to philosophy of mind and metaphysics, one or two of the uncharitable interpretations of Kant's work in that book receive important revisions in McDowell's later Woodbridge Lectures, published in the \"Journal of Philosophy\", Vol. 95, 1998, pp. 431–491. Those lectures are explicitly about Wilfrid Sellars, and assess whether or not Sellars lived up to his own critical principles in developing his interpretation of Kant (McDowell claims not). McDowell has, since the publication of \"Mind and World,\" largely continued to re-iterate his distinctive positions that go against the grain of much contemporary work on language, mind and value, particularly in North America where the influence of Wittgenstein has significantly waned.\n\nMcDowell's work has been heavily influenced by, among others, Ludwig Wittgenstein, P. F. Strawson, David Wiggins, and, especially in the case of his later work, Wilfrid Sellars. Many of the central themes in McDowell's work have also been pursued in similar ways by his Pittsburgh colleague Robert Brandom (though McDowell has stated strong disagreement with some of Brandom's readings and appropriations of his work). Both have been influenced by Richard Rorty, in particular Rorty's \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" (1979). In the preface to \"Mind and World\" (pp. ix–x) McDowell states that \"it will be obvious that Rorty's work is [...] central for the way I define my stance here.\" McDowell's own work has been criticized for its \"sometimes cryptic prose.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Speakers are older adults, and the younger generation has only a passive knowledge of the language.\n\nThe vast majority of Tunisian Jews have relocated to Israel and have shifted to Hebrew as their home language. Those in France typically use French as their primary language, while the few still left in Tunisia tend to use either French or Tunisian Arabic in their everyday lives.\n\nJudeo-Tunisian Arabic is one of the Judeo-Arabic languages, a collection of Arabic dialects spoken by Jews living or formerly living in the Arab world.\n\nA Jewish community existed in what is today Tunisia even prior to Roman rule in Africa. After the Arabic conquest of North Africa, this community began to use Arabic for their daily communication. They had adopted the pre-Hilalian dialect of Tunisian Arabic as their own dialect. As Jewish communities tend to be close-knit and isolated from the other ethnic and religious communities of their countries, their dialect spread to their coreligionists all over the country and had not been in contact with the languages of the communities that invaded Tunisia in the middle age. The primary language contact with regard to Judeo-Tunisian Arabic came from the languages of Jewish communities that fled to Tunisia as a result of persecution like Judeo-Spanish. This explains why Judeo-Tunisian Arabic lacks influence from the dialects of the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, and has developed several phonological and lexical particularities that distinguish it from Tunisian Arabic. This also explains why Judeo-Tunisian words are generally less removed from their etymological origin than Tunisian words.\n\nIn 1901, Judeo-Tunisian became one of the main spoken Arabic dialects of Tunisia, with thousands of speakers. Linguists noted the unique character of this dialect, and subjected it to study. Among the people studying Judeo-Tunisian Arabic, Daniel Hagege listed a significant amount of Judeo-Tunisian Arabic newspapers from the early 1900s in his essay \"The Circulation of Tunisian Judeo-Arabic Books\". However, its emergence has significantly declined since 1948 due to the creation of Israel. In fact, the Jewish community of Tunisia has either chosen to leave or was forced to leave Tunisia and immigrate to France or Israel. Nowadays, the language is largely extinct throughout most of Tunisia, even if it is still used by the small Jewish communities in Tunis, Gabes and Djerba, and most of the Jewish communities that have left Tunisia have chosen to change their language of communication to the main language of their current country.\n\nLanguage vitality: Judeo-Tunisian Arabic is believed to be vulnerable with only 500 speakers in Tunisia and with about 45,000 speakers in Israel\n\nLanguage variations: In Tunisia, geography plays a huge role in how Judeo-Tunisian Arabic varies between speakers. In fact, Tunisian Judeo-Arabic can vary depending on the region in which it is spoken. Accordingly, the main dialects of Judeo-Tunisian Arabic are:\nIn addition, Judeo-Tunisian can vary within the same region based on the town in which it is spoken.\n\nLike all other Judeo-Arabic languages, Judeo-Tunisian Arabic does not seem to be very different from the Arabic dialect from which it derives, Tunisian Arabic.\n\n\n"}

Subsequently followers of his like Ernest Jones developed the theme of lapsus in connection with writing, typing, and misprints.\n\nAccording to Freud's early psychoanalytic theory, a lapsus represents a bungled act that hides an unconscious desire: “the phenomena can be traced back to incompletely suppressed psychical material...pushed away by consciousness”.\n\nJacques Lacan would thoroughly endorse the Freudian interpretation of unconscious motivation in the slip, arguing that “in the \"lapsus\" it is...clear that every unsuccessful act is a successful, not to say 'well-turned', discourse”.\n\nIn the seventies Sebastiano Timpanaro would controversially take up the question again, by offering a mechanistic explanation of all such slips, in opposition to Freud's theories.\n\nIn literature, a number of different types of lapsus are named depending on the mode of correspondence:\n\nSlips of the tongue can happen on any level:\n\nAdditionally, each of these five levels of error may take various forms:\n\nMeringer and Meyer highlighted the role of familiar associations and similarities of words and sounds in producing the lapsus. Freud objected that such factors did not cause but only “\"favour\" slips of the tongue...in the immense majority of cases my speech is not disturbed by the circumstance that the words I am using recall others with a similar sound...or that familiar associations branch off from them”.\n\nTimpanaro later reignited the debate, by maintaining that any given slip can always be explained mechanically without a need for deeper motivation.\n\nJ. L. Austin had independently seen slips not as revealing a particular complex, but as an ineluctable feature of the human condition, necessitating a continual preparation for excuses and remedial work.\n\n"}

His articles and poetry were published in many of the megazines in Azerbaijani language at that time. During the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, Ordubadi joined Muslim Social Democratic Party (Hummet). He then published \"Bloody Years\" about the clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani populations in 1905. In 1918, he joined to Communist Party and his articles have published in the official newspaper of Hummet organization. He, along with XI Red Army, goes to Dagestan and publishes \"Red Dagestan\" magazine there. After the Sovietization of Azerbaijan he returns to Baku.\n\nToday, Ordubadi is remembered as one of the most important intellectuals of Azerbaijan during Soviet era. He served twice as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR, the highest legislative institution in the country. His novels include \"Sword and the Pen\", about the personality of Nizami Ganjavi, \"Foggy Tabriz\" about the Iranian constitutional revolution, also \"Mysterious Baku\" and \"Fighting City\" which both are about the revolutionary activities of Bolsheviks and 26 Baku Commissars. He also published articles about \"Narimanovism\" about the activity of national communism symbol in Azerbaijan, Nariman Narimanov.\n\nHe was initially educated at religious school, medrese, and later studied at Mahammad Sidgi's secular school \"Əxtər\" (Star). Mahammad Sidgi was well-known intellectual for his enlightenment activity in Russian Azerbaijan and the rest of Caucasus in the beginning of the 20th century. \n\nMammed Said lost his father at early age and had to work in a textile factory.\n\nHe started writing in the 1890s. His first writing was published in Tbilisi (then Tiflis) in a newspaper \"Shargi-Rus\" (\"Oriental Russia\") in 1903. In his early publications Ordubadi criticised ignorance, backwardness and religious fanaticism. In 1906 in Tbilisi he published his poetry book \"Qəflət\" (Ignorance) and in 1907 \"Vətən və hürriyyət\" \"(Fatherland and Freedom)\". He wrote for several Azerbaijani publications, including \"\"Molla Nasraddin\", \"Irshad\", \"Sada\"\" and others. Ordubadi covered various political, social and educational issues. He firmly stood for the necessity of the enlightenment of the Azerbaijani society under the Russian rule. In 1911, Ordubadi published a book \"Qanlı sənələr\" (Bloody years) - collection of first hand accounts of the Armenian-Tatar massacres in 1905-1906. In the 1910s, Ordubadi published several plays, stories and novels. In 1915, Russian authorities arrested him and exiled to Tsaritsyn. In 1918, he joined the Communist Party and returned to Baku in May 1920, after the Bolshevik conquest of Azerbaijan. \n\nOrdubadi became the editor-in-chief of \"\"Əxbar\", \"Yeni yol\", \"Molla Nasraddin\".\" \n\nDuring the Soviet period, Ordubadi wrote extensively novels, satiric stories, plays, librettos (to operas - \"\"Koroğlu\", \"Nərgiz\", \"Nizami\"\"). His famous works include \"Dumanlı Təbriz\" (Foggy Tabriz) (1933–1948) and \"Qılınc və qələm\" (Sword and Quill) (1946–1948).

They are commonly referred to as robos, an abbreviation of robotic camera. These systems can be remotely controlled by automation systems. The PTZ controls are generally sold separately without the cameras, but can also be sold as a set, as in the case of Fletcher cameras.\n\nPTZ is an abbreviation for pan, tilt and zoom and reflects the movement options of the camera. Other types of cameras are ePTZ or virtual pan-tilt-zoom (VPTZ) where a high-resolution camera digitally zooms and pans into portions of the image, with no physical camera movement. Ultra-low bandwidth surveillance streaming technologies use VPTZ to stream user-defined areas in higher quality without increasing overall bandwidth usage. Surveillance cameras of this type are often connected to a digital video recorder which records the full field of view in full quality.\n\nPTZ Cameras are commonly used in applications such as surveillance, video conferencing, live production, lecture capture and distance learning.\n\nAn innovation to the PTZ camera is a built-in firmware program that monitors the change of pixels generated by the video clip in the camera. When the pixels change due to movement within the camera's field of view, the camera can actually focus on the pixel variation and move the camera in an attempt to center the pixel fluctuation on the video chip. This results in the camera following movement. The program allows the camera to estimate the size of the object which is moving and distance of the movement from the camera. With this estimate, the camera can adjust the camera's optical lens, zooming in and out, in an attempt to stabilize the size of pixel fluctuation as a percentage of total viewing area. Once the movement exits the camera's field of view, the camera returns to a pre-programmed or \"parked\" position until it senses pixel variation and the process starts over again.\n\nPan-tilt-zoom cameras can be an essential part of modern surveillance systems. They can direct the attention to suspicious events. One method of surveillance with such cameras is based on master cameras monitoring a wide area that provide information so the PTZ camera can pan and tilt to the required position and observe and/or follow target movements.\n"}

{"id": "902502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=902502", "title": "Postage stamp color", "text": "Postage stamp color\n\nThe colors of postage stamps are at once obvious, and among the most difficult areas of philately. Different denominations of stamps have been printed in different colors since the very beginning; as with their successors, postal clerks could distinguish the Penny Black and Two pence blue more quickly by color than by reading the value, and the practice generally continues today. In practice, the actual color of a stamp may vary, and while collectors will pay high prices for rare shades, it may not be easy to tell those apart from variations caused by age, light, chemicals, and other factors. Stamp colors are routinely described by color name rather with any sort of a numerical system like CMYK; several color guides showing a selection of colors have been produced, but are not especially popular with collectors.\n\nNearly all stamps get their color from inks printed on white or light-colored paper; the handful of exceptions include early issues of Natal consisting only of embossing on colored paper, some recent stamps embossed on gold foil or with foil blocking to achieve a metallic appearance, and the Uganda Cowries produced on a typewriter. A number of early stamps were printed in black on differently-colored papers; the most famous example is the British Guiana 1c magenta.\n\nInitially, countries typically made a random choice of colors for denominations. In 1896, the members of the Universal Postal Union agreed on green, red, and blue as the standard colors for standard printed matter, postcard, and letter rates, respectively, when sent abroad. This convention was gradually abandoned as inflation created too many exceptions from the 1930s and onwards.\n\nStamps with two colors (\"bi-colored\") began to appear very early, although typically reserved for higher values, due to the added expense of multiple print runs. Multicolored stamps appeared along with the development of color printing techniques; they now account for the majority of modern stamps, although single-color designs are still common, more so for some countries than others.\n\nColor shades have several different causes. The printer may use a different ink; in the early days, inks were made up in batches as needed, and were rarely consistent. In such cases, the shade provides information about when the stamp was made, and possibly even identify a particular printing. Extreme variations may be considered color errors; for instance, the 4c value of the US Columbian Issue of 1893 was normally printed in ultramarine, but a handful were printed in blue, a shade with distinctly more green; these are worth in the US$10,000 range instead of the usual $10.\n\nInks may also be diluted or applied more thinly, as for instance the World War I stamps of Germany and World War II stamps of the United Kingdom. It can also happen randomly, if a printing plate is accidentally under-inked.\n\nUltraviolet light is destructive to a great many pigments, and can cause considerable lightening. In addition, some countries have used water-soluble materials known as fugitive inks to prevent postage stamp reuse. Stamps of this type may be much lighter in color after being soaked.\n\nSome dramatic color variations occur as a result of chemical action; such stamps are called color changelings. Examples include sulfuretting (often misnamed \"oxidation\"), a reaction involving lead that may turn a blue or green stamp to black, and the effects of salt water, famously seen in stamps of New South Wales recovered from the wreck of the \"Colombo\". Forgers have also used chemicals to try to produce seeming rarities, although by now experts know how to identify these attempts.\n\nIn general, collectors follow the stamp catalogs in matters of color nomenclature, even though the different catalogs are not consistent with each other. Although there are a great many named colors, the selection used by philatelists is limited to several dozen, modified by adjectives such as \"dark\", \"light\", \"pale\", \"bright\" and \"deep\". In addition, two color names may be combined, as in \"gray green\" or \"brown orange\", where the first name indicates the direction of modification to the second color. Thus \"brown orange\" is a duller and darker orange, while \"orange brown\" has a tinge to it that is more orange than would be seen with a \"yellow brown\" or \"red brown\". This system becomes less clear when extended to other colors, and few collectors could describe precisely how \"carmine rose\" is different from \"rose carmine\". Certain colors such as \"lake\", a shade of red which often commands a price premium, have a traditional, but somewhat uncertain, meaning which differs from general usage of \"lake\" in terms of pigments and dyes.\n\nOriginally, government-issued official descriptions merely gave out a primary name such as \"red\" for a whole range of shades. In more recent years, the descriptions have become more precise, such as \"dark sage green\", though not necessarily enlightening collectors any more than previously.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23711", "title": "Punctuation", "text": "Punctuation\n\nPunctuation (formerly sometimes called pointing) is the use of spacing, conventional signs and certain typographical devices as aids to the understanding and correct reading of handwritten and printed text whether read silently or aloud. Another description is, \"It is the practice action or system of inserting points or other small marks into texts in order to aid interpretation; division of text into sentences, clauses, etc., by means of such marks.\"\n\nIn written English, punctuation is vital to disambiguate the meaning of sentences. For example: \"woman, without her man, is nothing\" (emphasizing the importance of men), and \"woman: without her, man is nothing\" (emphasizing the importance of women) have very different meanings; as do \"eats shoots and leaves\" (which means the subject consumes plant growths) and \"eats, shoots, and leaves\" (which means the subject eats first, then fires a weapon, and then leaves the scene). The sharp differences in meaning are produced by the simple differences in punctuation within the example pairs, especially the latter.\n\nThe rules of punctuation vary with language, location, register and time and are constantly evolving. Certain aspects of punctuation are stylistic and are thus the author's (or editor's) choice, or tachygraphic language forms, such as those used in online chat and text messages.\n\nThe first writing systems were either logographic or syllabicfor example, Chinese and Mayan scriptwhich do not necessarily require punctuation, especially spacing. This is because the entire morpheme or word is typically clustered within a single glyph, so spacing does not help as much to distinguish where one word ends and the other starts. Disambiguation and emphasis can easily be communicated without punctuation by employing a separate written form distinct from the spoken form of the language that uses slightly different phraseology. Even today, written English differs subtly from spoken English because not all emphasis and disambiguation is possible to convey in print, even with punctuation.\n\nAncient Chinese classical texts were transmitted without punctuation. However, many Warring States period bamboo texts contain the symbols and indicating the end of a chapter and full stop, respectively. By the Song dynasty, addition of punctuation to texts by scholars to aid comprehension became common.\n\nThe earliest alphabetic writing had no capitalization, no spaces, no vowels and few punctuation marks. This worked as long as the subject matter was restricted to a limited range of topics (e.g., writing used for recording business transactions). Punctuation is historically an aid to reading aloud.\n\nThe oldest known document using punctuation is the Mesha Stele (9th century BC). This employs points between the words and horizontal strokes between the sense section as punctuation.\n\nMost texts were still written in \"scriptura continua\", that is without any separation between words. However, the Greeks were sporadically using punctuation marks consisting of vertically arranged dots—usually two (dicolon) or three (tricolon)—in around the 5th century as an aid in the oral delivery of texts. Greek playwrights such as Euripides and Aristophanes used symbols to distinguish the ends of phrases in written drama: this essentially helped the play's cast to know when to pause. After 200 , the Greeks used Aristophanes of Byzantium's system (called \"théseis\") of a single dot (\"punctus\") placed at varying heights to mark up speeches at rhetorical divisions:\nIn addition, the Greeks used the paragraphos (or gamma) to mark the beginning of sentences, marginal diples to mark quotations, and a koronis to indicate the end of major sections.\n\nThe Romans (\"ca\". 1st century ) also occasionally used symbols to indicate pauses, but the Greek \"théseis\"—under the name \"distinctiones\"—prevailed by the 4th century as reported by Aelius Donatus and Isidore of Seville (7th century). Also, texts were sometimes laid out \"per capitula\", where every sentence had its own separate line. Diples were used, but by the late period these often degenerated into comma-shaped marks.\n\nPunctuation developed dramatically when large numbers of copies of the Bible started to be produced. These were designed to be read aloud, so the copyists began to introduce a range of marks to aid the reader, including indentation, various punctuation marks (diple, paragraphos, \"simplex ductus\"), and an early version of initial capitals (\"litterae notabiliores\"). Jerome and his colleagues, who made a translation of the Bible into Latin, the \"Vulgate\" (\"ca\". 400), employed a layout system based on established practices for teaching the speeches of Demosthenes and Cicero. Under his layout \"per cola et commata\" every sense-unit was indented and given its own line. This layout was solely used for biblical manuscripts during the 5th-9th centuries but was abandoned in favor of punctuation.\n\nIn the 7th-8th centuries Irish and Anglo-Saxon scribes, whose native languages were not derived from Latin, added more visual cues to render texts more intelligible. Irish scribes introduced the practice of word separation. Likewise, insular scribes adopted the \"distinctiones\" system while adapting it for minuscule script (so as to be more prominent) by using not differing height but rather a differing number of marks—aligned horizontally (or sometimes triangularly)—to signify a pause's value: one mark for a minor pause, two for a medium one, and three for a major. Most common were the \"punctus\", a comma-shaped mark, and a 7-shaped mark (\"comma positura\"), often used in combination. The same marks could be used in the margin to mark off quotations.\n\nIn the late 8th century a different system emerged in France under the Carolingian dynasty. Originally indicating how the voice should be modulated when chanting the liturgy, the \"positurae\" migrated into any text meant to be read aloud, and then to all manuscripts. \"Positurae\" first reached England in the late 10th century probably during the Benedictine reform movement, but was not adopted until after the Norman conquest. The original \"positurae\" were the \"punctus\", \"punctus elevatus\", \"punctus versus\", and \"punctus interrogativus\", but a fifth symbol, the \"punctus flexus\", was added in the 10th century to indicate a pause of a value between the \"punctus\" and \"punctus elevatus\". In the late 11th/early 12th century the \"punctus versus\" disappeared and was taken over by the simple \"punctus\" (now with two distinct values).\n\nThe late Middle Ages saw the addition of the \"virgula suspensiva\" (slash or slash with a midpoint dot) which was often used in conjunction with the \"punctus\" for different types of pauses. Direct quotations were marked with marginal diples, as in Antiquity, but from at least the 12th century scribes also began entering diples (sometimes double) within the column of text.\n\nThe amount of printed material and its readership began to increase after the invention of moveable type in Europe in the 1450s. As explained by writer and editor Lynne Truss, \"The rise of printing in the 14th and 15th centuries meant that a standard system of punctuation was urgently required.\" The introduction of a standard system of punctuation has also been attributed to the Venetian printers Aldus Manutius and his grandson. They have been credited with popularizing the practice of ending sentences with the colon or full stop, inventing the semicolon, making occasional use of parentheses and creating the modern comma by lowering the virgule. By 1566, Aldus Manutius the Younger was able to state that the main object of punctuation was the clarification of syntax.\n\nBy the 19th century, punctuation in the western world had evolved \"to classify the marks hierarchically, in terms of weight\". Cecil Hartley's poem identifies their relative values:\n\n<poem style=margin:4em;>\nThe stop point out, with truth, the time of pause\nA sentence doth require at ev'ry clause.\nAt ev'ry comma, stop while \"one\" you count;\nAt semicolon, \"two\" is the amount;\nA colon doth require the time of \"three\";\nThe period \"four\", as learned men agree.\n</poem>\n\nThe use of punctuation was not standardised until after the invention of printing. According to the 1885 edition of \"The American Printer\", the importance of punctuation was noted in various sayings by children such as:\n\n<poem style=margin:4em;>\nCharles the First walked and talked\nHalf an hour after his head was cut off.\n</poem>\n\nWith a semi-colon and a comma added it reads:\n\n<poem style=margin:4em;>\nCharles the First walked and talked;\nHalf an hour after, his head was cut off.\n</poem>\n\nIn a 19th-century manual of typography, Thomas MacKellar writes:\n\nThe introduction of electrical telegraphy with a limited set of transmission codes and typewriters with a limited set of keys influenced punctuation subtly. For example, curved quotes and apostrophes were all collapsed into two characters (' and \"). The hyphen, minus sign, and dashes of various widths were collapsed into a single character (-, sometimes repeated as -- to represent a long dash). The spaces of different widths available to professional typesetters were generally replaced by a single full-character width space, with typefaces monospaced. In some cases a typewriter keyboard did not include an exclamation point (!) but this was constructed by the overstrike of an apostrophe and a period; the original Morse code did not represent an exclamation point at all.\n\nThese simplifications were carried forward into digital writing, with teleprinters and the ASCII character set essentially supporting the same characters as typewriters. Treatment of whitespace in HTML discouraged the practice (in English prose) of putting two full spaces after a full stop, since a single or double space would appear the same on the screen. (Some style guides now discourage double spaces, and some electronic writing tools automatically collapse double spaces to single.) The full traditional set of typesetting tools became available with the advent of desktop publishing and more sophisticated word processors. Despite the widespread adoption of character sets like Unicode that support traditionally typeset punctuation, writing forms like text messages tend to use the simplified ASCII style of punctuation, with the addition of new non-text characters like emoji. Informal text speak tends to drop punctuation when not needed, including some ways that would be considered errors in more formal writing.\n\nIn the computer era, punctuation characters were recycled for use in programming languages and data representation as in URLs. Due to its use in email and Twitter handles, the at sign went from an obscure character mostly used by grocers (and not professional typesetters) to a very common character in common use for both technical routing and an abbreviation for \"at\".\n\nThere are two major styles of punctuation in English: British or American. These two styles differ mainly in the way in which they handle quotation marks, particularly in conjunction with other punctuation marks. In British English, punctuation such as periods and commas are placed outside the closing quotation mark; in American English, however, punctuation is placed inside the closing quotation mark. This rule varies for other punctuation marks; for example, American English follows the British English rule when it comes to semicolons, colons, question marks, and exclamation points.\n\nOther languages of Europe use much the same punctuation as English. The similarity is so strong that the few variations may confuse a native English reader. Quotation marks are particularly variable across European languages. For example, in French and Russian, quotes would appear as: (in French, each \"double punctuation\", as the guillemet, requires a non-breaking space; in Russian it does not).\n\nIn French of France, the signs : ; ? and ! are always preceded by a thin unbreakable space. In Canada, this is only the case for :.\n\nIn Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point , known as the ().\n\nIn Georgian, three dots, , were formerly used as a sentence or paragraph divider. It is still sometimes used in calligraphy.\n\nSpanish uses an inverted question mark at the beginning of a question and the normal question mark at the end, as well as an inverted exclamation mark at the beginning of an exclamation and the normal exclamation mark at the end.\n\nArmenian uses several punctuation marks of its own. The full stop is represented by a colon, and vice versa; the exclamation mark is represented by a diagonal similar to a tilde , while the question mark resembles an unclosed circle placed after the last vowel of the word.\n\nArabic, Urdu, and Persian—written from right to left—use a reversed question mark: , and a reversed comma: . This is a modern innovation; pre-modern Arabic did not use punctuation. Hebrew, which is also written from right to left, uses the same characters as in English, and .\n\nOriginally, Sanskrit had no punctuation. In the 17th century, Sanskrit and Marathi, both written using Devanagari, started using the vertical bar to end a line of prose and double vertical bars in verse.\n\nPunctuation was not used in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean writing until the adoption of punctuation from the West in the late 19th and early 20th century. In unpunctuated texts, the grammatical structure of sentences in classical writing is inferred from context. Most punctuation marks in modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have similar functions to their English counterparts; however, they often look different and have different customary rules.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, is sometimes used in place of colon or after a subheading. Its origin is unclear, but could be a remnant of the British Raj. Another punctuation common in the Indian Subcontinent for writing monetary amounts is the use of or after the number. For example, Rs. 20/- or Rs. 20/= implies 20 rupees whole.\n\nThai did not use punctuation until the adoption of punctuation from the West in the 20th century. Blank spaces are more frequent than full stops or commas.\n\n\"Further information: Armenian punctuation, Chinese punctuation, Hebrew punctuation, Japanese punctuation and Korean punctuation.\"\n\nIn 1966, the French author Hervé Bazin proposed a series of six innovative punctuation marks in his book \"Plumons l'Oiseau\" (\"Let's pluck the bird\", 1966). These were:\n\nAn international patent application was filed, and published in 1992 under Work Order (WO) number WO9219458, for two new punctuation marks: the \"question comma\" and the \"exclamation comma\". The \"question comma\" has a comma instead of the dot at the bottom of a question mark, while the \"exclamation comma\" has a comma in place of the point at the bottom of an exclamation mark. These were intended for use as question and exclamation marks within a sentence, a function for which normal question and exclamation marks can also be used, but which may be considered obsolescent. The patent application entered into the national phase only in Canada. It was advertised as lapsing in Australia on 27 January 1994 and in Canada on 6 November 1995.\n\nVarious sets of characters are referred to as \"punctuation\" in certain computing situations, many of which are also used to punctuate natural languages. Sometimes non-punctuation in the natural language sense (such as \"&\" which is not punctuation but is an abbreviation for \"and\") are included.\n\nGeneral Punctuation and Supplemental Punctuation are blocks of Unicode symbols.\n\nIn regular expressions, the character class codice_1 is defined to consist of the following characters (when operating in ASCII mode): codice_2\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The term was first used by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in describing its procedures for working groups (WGs). \n\nThe means to establish rough consensus was described by the IETF as follows:\nWorking groups make decisions through a \"rough consensus\" process. IETF consensus does not require that all participants agree although this is, of course, preferred. In general, the dominant view of the working group shall prevail. (However, \"dominance\" is not to be determined on the basis of volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of agreement). Consensus can be determined by a show of hands, humming, or any other means on which the WG agrees (by rough consensus, of course). Note that 51% of the working group does not qualify as \"rough consensus\" and 99% is better than rough. It is up to the Chair to determine if rough consensus has been reached (IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures).\n\nThe phrase is often extended into the saying \"rough consensus and running code\", to make it clear that the IETF is interested in practical, working systems that can be quickly implemented. There is some debate as to whether running code leads to rough consensus or vice versa.\n\nThere is also caution about whether percentages are a good measure for rough consensus. The IETF published a subsequent document pointing out that supporting percentage is less important for determining \"rough consensus\" than ensuring opposing views are addressed.\n"}

Given that the output of word-sense induction is a set of senses for the target word (sense inventory), this task is strictly related to that of word-sense disambiguation (WSD), which relies on a predefined sense inventory and aims to solve the ambiguity of words in context.\n\nThe output of a word-sense induction algorithm is a clustering of contexts in which the target word occurs or a clustering of words related to the target word. Three main methods have been proposed in the literature:\n\n\nThe underlying hypothesis of this approach is that, words are semantically similar if they appear in similar documents, with in similar context windows, or in similar syntactic contexts. Each occurrence of a target word in a corpus is represented as a context vector. These context vectors can be either first-order vectors, which directly represent the context at hand, or second-order vectors, i.e., the contexts of the target word are similar if their words tend to co-occur together. The vectors are then clustered into groups, each identifying a sense of the target word. A well-known approach to context clustering is the Context-group Discrimination algorithm based on large matrix computation methods.\n\nWord clustering is a different approach to the induction of word senses. It consists of clustering words, which are semantically similar and can thus bear a specific meaning. Lin’s algorithm is a prototypical example of word clustering, which is based on syntactic dependency statistics, which occur in a corpus to produce sets of words for each discovered sense of a target word. The Clustering By Committee (CBC) also uses syntactic contexts, but exploits a similarity matrix to encode the similarities between words and relies on the notion of committees to output different senses of the word of interest. These approaches are hard to obtain on a large scale for many domain and languages.\n\nThe main hypothesis of co-occurrence graphs assumes that the semantics of a word can be represented by means of a co-occurrence graph, whose vertices are co-occurrences and edges are co-occurrence relations. These approaches are related to word clustering methods, where co-occurrences between words can be obtained on the basis of grammatical or collocational relations. HyperLex is the successful approaches of a graph algorithm, based on the identification of hubs in co-occurrence graphs, which have to cope with the need to tune a large number of parameters. To deal with this issue several graph-based algorithms have been proposed, which are based on simple graph patterns, namely Curvature Clustering, Squares, Triangles and Diamonds (SquaT++), and Balanced Maximum Spanning Tree Clustering (B-MST). The patterns aim at identifying meanings using the local structural properties of the co-occurrence graph. A randomized algorithm which partitions the graph vertices by iteratively transferring the mainstream message (i.e. word sense) to neighboring vertices is Chinese Whispers. By applying co-occurrence graphs approaches have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in standard evaluation tasks.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "763311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=763311", "title": "Yemenite Hebrew", "text": "Yemenite Hebrew\n\nYemenite Hebrew ( \"Ivrit Temanit\"), also referred to as Temani Hebrew, is the pronunciation system for Hebrew traditionally used by Yemenite Jews. Yemenite Jews brought their language to Israel through immigration. Their first organized immigration to the region began in 1882.\n\nYemenite Hebrew has been studied by language scholars, many of whom believe it to retain older phonetic and grammatical features lost elsewhere. Yemenite speakers of Hebrew have garnered considerable praise from language purists because of their use of grammatical features from classical Hebrew. Tunisian rabbi and scholar, Rabbi Meir Mazuz, once said of Yemenites that they are good grammarians. It is believed by some scholars that its phonology was heavily influenced by spoken Yemeni Arabic . Other scholars and rabbis, including Rabbi Yosef Qafih and Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, hold the view that Yemenite Hebrew was not influenced by Yemenite Arabic, as this type of Arabic was also spoken by Yemenite Jews and is distinct from the liturgical Hebrew and the conversational Hebrew of the communities. Among other things, Rabbi Qafih notes that the Yemenite Jews spoke Arabic with a distinct Jewish flavor, inclusive of pronouncing many Arabic words with vowels foreign to the Arabic language, e.g., the Qamats () and Tseri (). He argues that the pronunciation of Yemenite Hebrew was not only uninfluenced by Arabic, but it influenced the pronunciation of Arabic by those Jews, despite the Jewish presence in Yemen for over a millennium.\n\nAmong the dialects of Hebrew preserved into modern times, Yemenite Hebrew is regarded as one of the forms that retains very many features of Hebrew as used in ancient times, particularly Tiberian Hebrew and Mishnaic Hebrew. This perception is motivated in part by the fact that Yemenite Hebrew preserves many consonant sounds represented by individual letters in the Hebrew alphabet that have been lost elsewhere - except for \"sāmeḵ\" () and \"śīn\" (), which are both pronounced , but which had already merged in ancient times, as evident in the spelling variants in the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nYemenite Hebrew may have been derived from, or influenced by, the Hebrew of the Geonic era Babylonian Jews: the oldest Yemenite manuscripts use the Babylonian system of vowel symbols, which is believed to antedate the Tiberian vowel system. As late as 937 CE, Qirqisāni wrote: “The biblical readings which are wide-spread in Yemen are in the Babylonian tradition.\" Indeed, in many respects, such as the assimilation of \"paṯaḥ\" and \"səġūl\", the current Yemenite pronunciation fits the Babylonian notation better than the Tiberian (though the Babylonian notation does not reflect the approximation between \"holam\" and \"sere\" in some Yemenite dialects). This is because in the Babylonian tradition of vocalization there is no distinct symbol for the \"səġūl\". It does not follow, as claimed by some scholars, that the pronunciation of the two communities was identical, any more than the pronunciation of Sephardim and Ashkenazim is the same because both use the Tiberian symbols. \n\nThe following chart shows the seven vowel paradigms found in the Babylonian supralinear punctuation, which are reflected to this day by the Yemenite pronunciation of Biblical lections and liturgies, though they now use the Tiberian symbols. For example, there is no separate symbol for the Tiberian \"səġūl\" and the \"pataḥ\" and amongst Yemenites they have the same phonetic sound. It should be noted in this connection that the Babylonian vowel signs remained in use in Yemen long after the Babylonian Biblical tradition had been abandoned, almost until our own time.\n\nThe following chart shows the phonetic values of the Hebrew letters in the Yemenite Hebrew pronunciation tradition.\nAmong the Yemenites, they have preserved the sounds for each of the six double-sounding consonants: \"bəged-kəfet\" (). The following are examples of their peculiar way of pronunciation of these and other letters:\n\n\nYemenite pronunciation is not uniform, and Morag has distinguished five sub-dialects, the best known being probably Sana'ani, originally spoken by Jews in and around Sana'a. Roughly, the points of difference are as follows:\n\nThe Yemenites in their reading practices continue the orthographic conventions of the early grammarians, such as Abraham ibn Ezra and Aaron Ben-Asher. One basic rule of grammar states that every word with a long vowel sound, that is, one of either five vowel sounds whose mnemonics are \"pītūḥe ḥöthom\" (i.e. \"ḥiraq\", \"šūraq\", \"ṣeré\", \"ḥölam\" and \"qamaṣ\"), whenever there is written beside one of these long vowel sounds a \"meteg\" (or what is also called a \"ga’ayah\") and is denoted by a small vertical line below the word (such as shown here זָכְרוּ), it indicates that the vowel (in that case, \"qamaṣ\") must be drawn out with a prolonged sound. For example, ōōōōōō, instead of ō, (e.g. \"zoː— kh ru\"). In the Sephardic tradition, however, the practice is different altogether, and they will also alter the phonetic sound of the long vowel \"qamaṣ\" whenever the vowel appears alongside a \"meteg\" (a small vertical line), giving to it the sound of \"a\", as in \"cat\", instead of \"ōōōōō.\" Thus, for the verse in , the Sephardic Jews will pronounce the word כָּל as \"kal\" (e.g. \"kal ʕaṣmotai\", etc.), instead of \"kol ʕaṣmotai\" as pronounced by both Yemenite and Ashkenazi Jewish communities.\n\nThe \"meteg\", or \"ga’ayah\", has actually two functions: (1) It extends the sound of the vowel; (2) It makes any šewa that is written immediately after the vowel a mobile \"šewa\", meaning, the \"šewa\" itself takes on the sound of a reduced vowel in Germanic languages, equivalent to , or \"a\" in the word \"about.\" For example: \"šoː m ru\"= (שָׁמְרו), \"ye r du\"= (יֵרְדו), \"ye d ‘u\"= (יֵדְעו), \"ʔö m rim\"= (אוֹמְרים), \"šö m rim\"= (שׁוֹמְרים), \"sī s ra\"= (סִיסְרא), \"šū v kha\"= (שׁוּבְך) and \"tū v kha\"= (טוּבְך), et al.\n\nThe \"Qamats qatan\" is realized as the non-extended \"o\"-sound in the first \"qamats\" (\"qamaṣ\") in the word, חָכְמָה ⇒ \"ḥokhma\" (wisdom).\n\nThe Yemenite \"qamaṣ\" , represented in the transliterated texts by the diaphoneme , is pronounced as the English \"a\"-sound in \"all\" or as in \"halt\", or \"caught,\" and this phoneme is always the same, whether for a long or short vowel, but the long vowel sound is always prolonged.\n\nA distinct feature of Yemenite Hebrew is that there is some degree of approximation between the \"ḥōlam\" and the \"ṣêrệ\". To the untrained ear, they may sound as the same phoneme, but Yemenite grammarians will point out the difference. The feature varies by dialect:\n\n\nSome see the assimilation of the two vowels as a local variant within the wider Babylonian family, which the Yemenites happened to follow.\n\nRabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and Rabbi Jacob Saphir have praised the Yemenites in their correct pronunciation of Hebrew. They still read the biblical lections and liturgies according to what is prescribed for Hebrew grammar and are meticulous to pronounce the mobile \"šĕwā\" in each of its changing forms. While most other communities also adhere to the rule of mobile \"šĕwā\" whenever two \"šĕwā\"s are written one after the other, as in , most have forgotten its other usages.\nAharon Ben-Asher, in his treatise on the proper usage of Hebrew vowels and trope symbols, writes on the \"šĕwā\": \"[It is] the servant of all the letters in the entire Scriptures, whether at the beginning of the word, or in the middle of the word, or at the end of the word; whether what is pronounced by the tongue or not pronounced, for it has many ways… However, if it is joined with one of four [guttural] letters, א ח ה ע, its manner [of pronunciation] will be like the manner of the vowel of the second letter in that word, such as: בְּֽהֹנוֹת ידיהם ורגליהם = \"bhonoth\"; מתי פתים תְּֽאֵהֲבוּ פתי = \"t’ehavu\"; עיניו לְֽחֵלְכָה יצפנו = \"lḥeləkhah\"; שריה רְֽעֵלָיָה מרדכי = \"rʻeloyoh\".\" \nOn the mobile \"šĕwā\" and its usage amongst Yemenite Jews, Israeli grammarian Shelomo Morag wrote: \"The pronunciation of the \"šĕwā\" mobile preceding א, ה, ח, ע, or ר in the Yemenite tradition is realized in accordance with the vowel following the guttural; quantitatively, however, this is an ultra-short vowel. For example, a word such as is pronounced \"wḥuṭ\". A \"šĕwā\" preceding a \"yōḏ\" is pronounced as an ultra-short \"ḥīreq\": the word is pronounced \"byōm\". This is the way the \"šĕwā\" is known to have been pronounced in the Tiberian tradition.\"\n\nOther examples of words of the mobile \"šĕwā\" in the same word taking the phonetic sound of the vowel assigned to the adjacent guttural letter or of a mobile \"šĕwā\" before the letter \"yod\" (י) taking the phonetic sound of the \"yod\", can be seen in the following: \nמִזְמוֹר שִׁיר לְיוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת. טוֹב לְהֹדוֹת לַה' וּלְזַמֵּר לְשִׁמְךָ עֶלְיון. לְהַגִּיד בַּבֹּקֶר חַסְדֶּךָ וֶאֱמוּנָתְךָ בַּלֵּילוֹת\n\nThe above rule applies only to when one of the four guttural letters (אחהע), or a \"yod\" (י) or a resh (ר) follows the mobile \"šĕwā\", but it does not apply to the other letters; then, the mobile \"šĕwā\" is always read as a short-sounding \"pataḥ\".\n\nGeographically isolated for centuries, the Yemenite Jews constituted a peculiar phenomenon within Diaspora Jewry. In their isolation, they preserved specific traditions of both Hebrew and Aramaic. The traditions, transmitted from generation to generation through the teaching and reciting of the Bible, post-biblical Hebrew literature (primarily the Mishnah), the Aramaic Targums of the Bible, and the Babylonian Talmud, are still alive. They are manifest in the traditional manner of reading Hebrew that is practised by most members of the community. The Yemenite reading traditions of the Bible are now based on the Tiberian text and vocalization, as proofread by the masorete, Aaron ben Asher, with the one exception that the vowel \"sǝġūl\" is pronounced as a \"pataḥ\", since the \"sǝġūl\" did not exist in the Babylonian orthographic tradition to which the Jews of Yemen had previously been accustomed. In what concerns Biblical orthography, with the one exception of the \"sǝgūl\", the Yemenite Jewish community does not differ from any other Jewish community.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of post-Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic words are pronounced the same way or nearly the same way by all of Israel's diverse ethnic groups, including the Jews of Yemen, there are still other words whose phonemic system differs greatly from the way it is used in Modern Hebrew, the sense here being the tradition of vocalization or diction of selective Hebrew words found in the Mishnah and Midrashic literature, or of Aramaic words found in the Talmud, and which tradition has been meticulously preserved by the Jews of Yemen. The following diagrams show a few of the more conspicuous differences in the Yemenite tradition of vocalization and which Israeli linguist, Shelomo Morag, believes reflects an ancient form of vocalizing the texts and was once known and used by all Hebrew-speakers.\n\nNotes on transliteration: In the Yemenite Jewish tradition, the vowel \"qamaṣ\" , represents . The Hebrew character \"Tau\" (), without a dot of accentuation, represents . The Hebrew character \"Gimal\" (), with a dot of accentuation, represents . The Hebrew word גנאי (in the above middle column, and meaning 'a thing detestable'), is written in Yemenite Jewish tradition with a vowel \"qamaṣ\" beneath the , but since it is followed by the letters אי it represents . The vowel \"ḥolam\" in the Yemenite dialect is transcribed here with , and represents a front rounded vowel. Another peculiarity with the Yemenite dialect is that the vast majority of Yemenite Jews (excluding the Jews of Sharab in Yemen) will replace , used here in transliteration of texts, with the phonetic sound of .\n\nIt is to be noted that in the Yemenite tradition, the plural endings on the words זָכִיּוֹת (\"merits\"), מַלְכִיּוֹת (\"kingdoms\"), גָּלִיּוֹת (\"exiles\"), טעִיּוֹת (\"errors\"), טרפִיּוֹת (\"defective animals\") and עֵדִיּוֹת (\"testimonies\"), all differ from the way they are vocalized in Modern Hebrew. In Modern Hebrew, these words are marked with a \"shuraq\", as follows: זָכֻיּוֹת - מַלְכֻיּוֹת - גָּלֻיּוֹת - טעֻיּוֹת - טרפֻיּוֹת - עֵדֻיּוֹת. Although the word (\"kingdoms\") in Daniel 8:22 is vocalized \"malkhuyöth\", as it is in Modern Hebrew, Shelomo Morag thinks that the Yemenite tradition reflects a phonological phenomenon known as dissimilation, whereby similar consonants or vowels in a word become less similar. Others explain the discrepancy as being in accordance with a general rule of practice, prevalent in the 2nd century CE, where the Hebrew in rabbinic literature was distinguished from that of Biblical Hebrew, and put into an entire class and category of its own, with its own rules of vocalization (see \"infra\").\n\nThe Hebrew noun חֲתִיכָּה (\"ḥăṯīkkah\"), in the upper left column, is a word meaning \"slice/piece\" (in the absolute state), or חֲתִיכַּת בשר (\"piece of meat\") in the construct state. The noun is of the same metre as קְלִיפָּה (\"qǝlipah\"), a word meaning \"peel,\" or the \"rind\" of a fruit. Both the \"kaph\" and \"pe\" in these nouns are with a \"dagesh\". However, the same roots applied to different meters, serving as gerunds, as in \"slicing/cutting\" [meat] and \"peeling\" [an apple], the words would respectively be חֲתִיכָה (\"ḥăṯīḫah\") and קליפָה (\"qǝlīfah\"), without a \"dagesh\" in the Hebrew characters \"Kaph\" and \"Pe\" (i.e. \"rafe\" letters), such as when the verb is used with the preposition \"after\": e.g. \"after peeling the apple\" = אחרי קליפת התפוח, or \"after cutting the meat\" = אחרי חתיכת הבשר.\n\nIn the Talmud , the Sages of Israel had a practice to read words derived from the Scriptures in their own given way, while the same words derived from the Talmud or in other exegetical literature (known as the Midrash) in a different way: \"When Isse the son of Hinei went up [there], he found Rabbi Yoḥanan teaching [a certain Mishnah] to the creations, saying, \"raḥelim\" (i.e. רחלים = the Hebrew word for \"ewes\"), etc. He said to him, 'Teach it [by its Mishnaic name = רחלות], \"raḥeloth\"!' He replied, '[What I say is] as it is written [in the Scriptures]: Ewes (\"raḥelim\"), two-hundred.' He answered him, 'The language of the Torah is by itself, and the language employed by the Sages is by itself!'\" (לשון תורה לעצמה, לשון חכמים לעצמן).\n\nThis passage from the Talmud is often quoted by grammarians of Yemenite origin to explain certain \"discrepancies\" found in vocalization of words where a comparable source can be found in the Hebrew Bible, such as the Yemenite tradition in rabbinic literature to say (\"maʻbīr\"), rather than (\"maʻăvīr\") – although the latter rendering appears in Scripture , or to say (\"zīʻah\"), with \"ḥīraq\", rather than, (\"zeʻah\"), with \"ṣerê\", although it too appears in Scripture , or to say (\"birkhath ha-mazon\") (= \"kaph\" rafe), rather than as the word \"blessing\" in the construct state which appears in the Scriptures , e.g. \"birkath Avraham\" (ברכת אברהם), with \"kaph\" dagesh. Others, however, say that these anomalies reflect a tradition that antedates the Tiberian Masoretic texts.\n\nIn Yemenite tradition, many words in both Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew which are written with the final \"hê\" ending (without the \"mappîq\") are realized by a secondary glottal stop, meaning, they are abruptly cut short, as when one holds his breath. Shelomo Morag who treats upon this peculiarity in the Yemenite tradition of vocalization brings down two examples from the Book of Isaiah, although by no means exclusive, where he shows the transliteration for the words תִּפָּדֶה in Isaiah 1:27 and וְנֵלְכָה in Isaiah 2:5, and both of which represent , as in \"tippoːdä(ʔ)\" and \"wǝnelχoː(ʔ)\" respectively. The word פָרָשָׁה (Bible Codex) in the upper-middle column is pronounced in the same way, e.g. \"frsh\".\n\nExcursus: The preposition (), translated as \"of\" or \"belonging to\" in English, is unique in the Yemenite Jewish tradition. The Hebrew preposition is always written with the noun, joined together as one word, and the \"lamed\" is always accentuated with a \"dagesh\". For example, if the noun, מלך ⇒ \"king\", would normally have been written with the definite article \"the,\" as in הַמֶּלֶךְ ⇒ \"the king\", and the noun was to show possession, as in the sentence: \"the palace of the king,\" the definite article \"the\" (Hebrew: ה) is dropped, but the same vowel \"pataḥ\" of the definite article is carried over to the \"lamed\", as in שֶׁלַּמֶּלֶךְ, instead of של המלך. The vowel on the \"lamed\" will sometimes differ, depending on what noun comes after the preposition. For example, the definite article \"the\" in Hebrew nouns which begin with \"aleph\" or \"resh\" and sometimes \"ayin\", such as in הָאָדָם and in הָרִאשׁוֹן, or in הָעוֹלָם, is written with the vowel \"qamaṣ\" – in which case, the vowel \"qamaṣ\" is carried over to the \"lamed\", as in שֶׁלָּאָדָם and in שֶׁלָּרִאשׁוֹן and in שֶׁלָּעוֹלָם. Another general rule is that whenever a possessive noun is written without the definite article \"the\", as in the words, \"a king's sceptre,\" or \"the sceptre of a king\" (Heb. מלך), the \"lamed\" in the preposition is written with the vowel \"shǝwa\" (i.e. mobile \"shǝwa\"), as in שרביט שֶׁלְּמֶּלֶךְ, and as in, \"if it belongs to Israel\" ⇒ אם הוא שֶׁלְּיִשְׂרַאֵל. Whenever the noun begins with a \"shǝwa\", as in the proper noun \"Solomon\" (Heb. שְׁלֹמֹה) and one wanted to show possession, the \"lamed\" in the preposition is written with a \"ḥiraq\", as in (\"Song of Solomon\" 3:7): מטתו שֶׁלִּשְׁלֹמֹה ⇒ \"Solomon's bed\", or as in עונשם שֶׁלִּרְשָׁעִים ⇒ \"the punishment of the wicked\", or in חבילה שֶׁלִּתְרוּמָה ⇒ \"a bundle of heave-offering.\"\n\nAnother rule of practice in Hebrew grammar is that two \"shǝwa\"s חְ are never written one after the other at the beginning of any word; neither can two \"ḥaṭaf pataḥ\"s חֲ or two \"ḥaṭaf sǝġūl\"s חֱ be written at the beginning of a word one after the other. The practical implication arising from this rule is that when there is a noun beginning with a \"ḥaṭaf pataḥ\", as in the word, חֲבִרְתָּהּ ⇒ “her companion”, and one wishes to add thereto the preposition “to” – as in, “to her companion” ⇒ לַחֲבִרְתָּהּ, the \"lamed\" is written with the vowel \"pataḥ\", instead of a \"shǝwa\" (i.e. a mobile \"shǝwa\"), seeing that the \"shǝwa\" at the beginning of a word and the \"ḥaṭaf pataḥ\", as well as the \"ḥaṭaf sǝġūl\", are all actually one and the same vowel (in the Babylonian tradition), and it is as though he had written two \"shǝwa\"s one after the other. Likewise, in the possessive case, “belonging to her companion” ⇒ שֶׁלַּחֲבִרְתָּהּ, the \"lamed\" in the preposition של is written with the vowel \"pataḥ\".\n\nThe Leiden MS. of the Jerusalem Talmud is important in that it preserves some earlier variants to textual readings of that Talmud, such as in Tractate \"Pesaḥim\" 10:3 (70a), which brings down the old Palestinian-Hebrew word for \"charoseth\" (the sweet relish eaten at Passover), viz. \"dūkeh\" (), instead of \"rūbeh/rabah\" (), saying with a play on words: “The members of Isse's household would say in the name of Isse: Why is it called \"dūkeh\"? It is because she pounds [the spiced ingredients] with him.” The Hebrew word for \"pound\" is \"dakh\" (), which rules out the spelling of \" \"rabah\" \" (), as found in the printed editions. Today, the Jews of Yemen, in their vernacular of Hebrew, still call the \"charoseth\" by the name \"dūkeh\".\n\nOther quintessential Hebrew words which have been preserved by the Jews of Yemen is their manner of calling a receipt of purchase by the name, \"roy\" (), rather than the word \" \"qabbalah\" \" that is now used in Modern Hebrew. The weekly biblical lection read on Sabbath days is called by the name \"seder\" (), since the word \"parashah\" () has a completely different meaning, denoting a Bible Codex containing the first Five Books of Moses (plural: codices = פרשיות).\n\nCharity; alms (, \"miṣwoː\"), so-called in Yemenite Jewish parlance, was usually in the form of bread, collected in baskets each Friday before the Sabbath by those appointed over this task for distribution among the needy, without them being brought to shame. The same word is often used throughout the Jerusalem Talmud, as well as in Midrashic literature, to signify what is given out to the poor and needy. Today, in Modern Hebrew, the word is seldom used to imply charity, replaced now by the word, \"ts’dakah\" (Heb. צְדָקָה). In contrast, the word צדקה amongst Jews in Sana’a was a tax levied upon Jewish householders, particularly those whose professions were butchers, and which tax consisted of hides and suet from butchered animals, and which things were sold on a daily basis by the Treasurer, and the money accruing from the sale committed to the public fund for the Jewish poor of the city, which money was distributed to the city's poor twice a year; once on Passover, and once on Sukkot. The fund itself was known by the name \"tḏer\" (), lit. \"the constant [revenues].\"\n\nAlthough Jews in Yemen widely made-use of the South-Arabic word \"mukhwāṭ\" () for the “metal pointer” (stylus) used in pointing at the letters of sacred writ, they also knew the old Hebrew word for the same, which they called \"makhtev\" (). The following story is related about this instrument in Midrash Rabba: “Rabban [Shimon] Gamliel says: ‘Five-hundred schools were in Beter, while the smallest of them wasn’t less than three-hundred children. They used to say, ‘If the enemy should ever come upon us, with these \"metal pointers\" () we’ll go out against them and stab them!’…”\n\nIn other peculiar words of interest, they made use of the word, \"shilṭön\" (), for “governor” or “king,” instead of “government,” the latter word now being the more common usage in Modern Hebrew; \"kothev\" (), for “scrivener”, or copyist of religious texts, instead of the word “sofer” (scribe); \"ṣibbūr\" (), for \"a quorum of at least ten adult males,\" a word used in Yemen instead of the Modern Hebrew word, \"minyan\"; \"ḥefeṣ\" (), a noun meaning “desirable thing,” was used by them to describe any “book” (especially one of a prophylactic nature), although now in Modern Hebrew it means “object”; \"fiqfūq\" () had the connotation of “shock,” “violent agitation,” or “shaking-up,” although today, in Modern Hebrew, it has the meaning of “doubt” or “skepticism”; the word, \"harpathqe\" (), was used to describe “great hardships,” although in Modern Hebrew the word has come to mean “adventures.” The word \"fazmūn\" (), any happy liturgical poem, such as those sung on \"Simhat Torah\", differs from today’s Modern Hebrew word, \"pizmon\" (), meaning, a “chorus” to a song. Another peculiar aspect of Yemenite Hebrew is what concerns denominative verbs. One of the nouns used for bread (made of wheat) is \"himmuṣ\" (), derived from the blessing that is said whenever breaking bread, [המוציא [לחם מן הארץ = \"He that brings forth\" [bread from the earth]. Whenever they wanted to say its imperative form, “break bread!”, they made use of the denominative verb \"hammeṣ\"! (). Similarly, the noun for the Third Sabbath meal was \"qiyyūm\" (), literally meaning “observance,” in which they made use of the denominative verb, \"tǝqayyem\" () = \"Will you eat with us\" (the Third Sabbath meal)?, or, נְקַיֵּם = \"Let us eat\" (the Third Sabbath meal), or, \"qiyam\" () = \"He ate\" (the Third Sabbath meal).\n\n\n\n"}
