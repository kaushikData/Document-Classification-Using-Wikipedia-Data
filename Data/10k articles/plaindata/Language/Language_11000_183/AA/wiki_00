Aarudhra is the nephew of Telugu poet Sri Sri, and is also known for his works exclusively in Telugu cinema as a screenwriter, dialogue writer, and story writer, and is the recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1987.\n\nAarudra was born in Yelamanchili, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India on 31 August 1925. After the primary education, he shifted to Vizianagaram in 1942 for his college education. He got attracted to Communism after coming into contact with people like \"Ronanki Appalaswami\" and Chaganti Somayajulu. He joined the Indian Air Force as a Band Boy in 1943 and served it till 1947. He shifted to Madras and worked as editor of \"Anandavani\" magazine for two years. Joining the cine field in 1949, he wrote lyrics and dialogues for many films. He married noted writer K. Rama Lakshmi (a columnist and a writer-critic in her own right) in 1954.\n\"Tvamevaham\" (You are none other than me) and \"Samagra Andhra Sahityam\" (An Encyclopedia of Telugu Literature) are his landmark works. He wrote poetry such as \"Koonalamma Padaalu\", reminiscences of the Second World War.\nHe belonged to the school of progressive writers such as \"Abhyudaya Rachayitala Sangham\".\n\"Tvamevaaham\" written in 1948 was based on the contemporary violence and lawlessness during the Razakar movement in the princely state of Hyderabad. The Razakar attrocoties were sponsored by the Nizam against his own people who wanted to overthrow him in favor of democracy and join the Indian Union. In this kaavyam, death spoke to a human being and says, \"you and I are the same (Tvamevaaham)\".\n\nAn imaginary sand clock and a water clock were used by the poet to depict time in \"Tvamevaham\". The `hours' are a symbol of the rich and affluent, the `minutes' denote the attitude of the middle class and the `seconds' are likened to the mentality of the working class. A stop watch was depicted as an instrument to measure `revolution'. The `key' fanned revolution, while the `alarm' was a warning of the prevailing situation.\n\nAarudhra first published the SAS in 12 parts between 1965 and 1968. It spans the Telugu literature from the 9th century CE to modern times. He chronicled the history of Telugu Literature in 12 volumes:\n\n\"Ramudiki Sita Yemautundi?\" or \"How is Sita related to Rama?\", put before the public the riddle of Mandodari, Sita and Hanuman and their origins in a lucid and scholarly way. It was a bold attempt at cracking the Valmiki-Ramayana code and in the process de-mystified the story of Rama to the middle-class, literate, modern day Telugu reader.\nThe book explores the Buddhist and Jain sources of the story of Rama. It also surveys the Khotan Siam (Thai), Laos, and Malaysian versions of the story of Rama. Here is a sampling from the 'Dasaratha Jataka ', a Buddhist Tale:\nBuddha narrates the 'Dasaratha Jataka' tale to a householder who was grieving the death of his son...Long long ago.. Dasaratha was the king of Varanasi. He had sixteen thousand wives.The Queen had two sons and a daughter.The eldest son was called Ramapundit and the younger one was called Laxmanpundit.The daughter was called Sitadevi. The Queen dies after sometime. Dasaratha marries again, and comes to like her the most. She begets a son named Bharata...When Ramapundit returns from the forest, he marries Sita and rules for 16000 years...Bodhisatta concludes the story stating that Dasaratha was none other than Shuddhodana (Father of Buddha) in an earlier reincarnation. Similarly, Sita was none other than Rahulmata(Mother of Rahul or Wife of Buddha) and Ramapundit was none other than Buddha himself.\n\nAarudra's questions like \"How is Sita related to Rama?\" or \"Were they just Husband and wife?\" may sound naive or sacrilegious but a serious study of genealogies, as revealed from different sources, logically leads to them. To deny the existence of such stories, per Arudra, would amounted to intellectual dishonesty.\n\nHis Film songs are compiled and published by his wife K. Ramalaxmi in five volumes.,\n"}

Between the years of 450 and 447BCE, the use of Athenian silver currency and Athenian weights and measures was made obligatory in all allied states of the Athenian Empire. \n\nScholarly opinion is split in regards to the dating of the Athenian Coinage Decree. Various fragments from cities allied to Athens have been used to reconstruct the decree. The decree required that all allied currencies be taken out of circulation and melted down to be replaced with Attic coins, with a small difference in the exchange rate favouring Athens; the Athenian mint benefited as the allies’ mints were closed down. This encouraged the flow of trade through the Aegean and especially between Athens and the allied states. However, the measure did impinge upon the autonomy of the allied states. The use of Athenian currency had become increasingly common, especially with smaller states, but many continued to mint their own coins with their own state symbol. The result was that the overall volume of trade in the Aegean increased, but with greater domination by Athens.\n"}

The occupation of the Low Countries by the Dukes of Burgundy also brought Burgundian into contact with Dutch; e.g., the word for gingerbread \"couque\" derives from Old Dutch \"kooke\" (cake).\n\nDialects of the south along the Saône river, such as Brionnais-Charolais, have been influenced by the Arpitan language, which is spoken mainly in a neighbouring area that approximates the heartland of the original Kingdom of Burgundy.\n\nEugène de Chambure published a \"Glossaire du Morvan\" in 1878.\n\nApart from songs dating from the eighteenth century, there is little surviving literature from before the nineteenth century. In 1854 the Papal Bull \"Ineffabilis Deus\" was translated into the Morvan dialect by the Abbé Jacques-François Baudiau, and into the Dijon dialect by the Abbé Lereuil. The Abbé Baudiau also transcribed storytelling.\n\nFolklorists collected vernacular literature from the mid-nineteenth century and by the end of the century a number of writers were establishing an original literature. Achille Millien (1838–1927) collected songs from the oral tradition in the Nivernais. Louis de Courmont, nicknamed the \"Botrel of the Morvan,\" was a chansonnier who after a career in Paris returned to his native region. A statue was erected to him in Château-Chinon. Emile Blin wrote a number of stories and monologues aimed at a tourist market; a collection was published in 1933 under the title \"Le Patois de Chez Nous.\" Alfred Guillaume published a large number of vernacular texts for use on picturesque postcards at the beginning of the twentieth century, and in 1923 published a book in Burgundian, \"L'âme du Morvan.\" More recently, Marinette Janvier published \"Ma grelotterie\" (1974) and \"Autour d'un teugnon\" (1989).\n\n"}
{"id": "6257622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6257622", "title": "Cora language", "text": "Cora language\n\nCora is an indigenous language of Mexico of the Uto-Aztecan language family. It is spoken by the ethnic group that is widely known as the Cora but who refer to themselves as \"Naáyarite\". The Cora inhabit the northern sierra of the Mexican state Nayarit which is named after its indigenous inhabitants. Cora is a Mesoamerican language and shows many of the traits defining the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. Under the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples it is recognized as a \"national language\" along with 62 other indigenous languages and Spanish which have the same \"validity\" in Mexico .\n\nEthnologue distinguishes two main variants of Cora. One is called \"Cora del Nayar\" or \"Cora Meseño\" and is spoken mainly in and around the medium-altitude settlements of Mesa de Nayar and Conel Gonzales in the south of the el Nayar municipality of Nayarit, and has approximately 9,000 speakers (1993 census). There are significant differences between some of these varieties and some sources distinguish between \"Cora Mariteco\" (of Jesus Maria), \"Cora Presideño\" (of Presidio de los Reyes), \"Cora Corapeño\" (of San Juan Corapan) and \"Cora Franciscqueño\" (of San Francisco). But Ethnologue considers the mutual intelligibilitiy between these and \"Meseño\" to be high enough to classify them as a single language.\n\nThe other variant recognized by the Ethnologue is called \"Cora de Santa Teresa\" or \"Cora Tereseño\" and is spoken by approximately 7,000 people (1993 census), for the most part in the high sierra in the north of el Nayar. Cora de Santa Teresa has such a low degree of mutual intelligibility with other Cora speech communities that Ethnologue considers it a separate variety. Due to recent migrations a small community of Coras exists in the United States in western Colorado.\n\nCora speakers themselves recognize only five dialects: Cora de Jesús María, Cora de Mesa de Nayar, Cora de Sta. Teresa, Cora de Corápan and Cora de San Francisco. Highland speakers consider Cora of Preseidio de los Reyes to be identical to the dialect of the other lowland community Corápan, and Cora of Dolores to be identical to Cora of Sta Teresa. \n\nCora is spoken in a number of dialects, some of which have difficult mutual intelligibility. ISO distinguishes two languages, INALI nine.\n\nThe closest relatives of the Cora language is the Huichol language together with which it forms the Coracholan subgroup of the Uto-Aztecan languages. The Taracahitan group of languages containing among others the languages Tarahumara, Yaqui and Mayo is also related to Cora.\n\n\nThe phonology of Cora is typical of southern Uto-Aztecan languages, with five vowels and a relatively simple consonant inventory. However atypically of Uto-aztecan languages, Cora has developed a simple tonal system or pitch accent with an harmonic accent taking high falling tone.\n\nCora is a verb-initial language; its grammar is agglutinative and polysynthetic, particularly inflecting verbs with many affixes and clitics. There are a number of adpositional clitics that can also be used as relational nouns.\n\nNouns are marked for possession and exhibit several different plural patterns.\n\nDifferent classes of nouns mark the plural in different manners. The most common way is by means of suffixes - The suffixes used for pluralization are the following: -\"te\", -\"mwa\", -\"mwa'a\", -\"tse\", -\"tsi\", -\"kʉ\", -\"sʉ\", -\"se\", -\"si\", -\"ri\" and -\"i\". Other ways to form the plural is by reduplication of the final vowel of a noun stem or by shifting the accent from one syllable to the other. Another class of works form their plurals by suppletion.\n\nPossessed nouns are marked with a prefix expressing the person and number of their possessor. \nThe forms of the prefix expressing first person singular is \"ne\"-, \"na\"-, or \"ni\"-, for second person singular it is \"a\"-, \"mwa'a\"-, \"a'a\"-. The third person singular is marked by the prefix \"ru\"-. A first person plural possessor is marked by the prefix \"ta\"-, second person plural by \"ha'amwa\"- and third person plural by \"wa'a\"-. Furthermore, there are two suffixes. One, -\"ra'an\" is used to mark an obviative or fourth person possessor. The other is -\"me'en\" used to mark a plural possessum of a singular possessor.\n\nVerbs are inflected for person and number of subject and direct object and object prefixes for 3rd person inanimate objects also show the basic shape of the object. Verbs are also inflected for location and direction.\n\nTypologically Cora is interesting because it is a VSO language but also has postpositions, a trait that is rare cross-linguistically but does occur in a few Uto-Aztecan languages (Papago, Tepehuán, and some dialects of Nahuatl).\n\nCora-language programming is carried by the CDI's radio station XEJMN-AM, broadcasting from Jesús María, Nayarit.\n\n\n"}

She is the best-known of the last fluent, native speakers of the Cornish language.\n\nBaptised on 16 May 1692, Pentreath was probably the second of the six children of fisherman Nicholas Pentreath and his second wife Jone Pentreath. She later claimed that she could not speak a word of English until the age of 20. Whether or not this is correct, Cornish was her first language. In old age, she remembered that as a child she had sold fish at Penzance in the Cornish language, which most local inhabitants (even the gentry) then understood. She lived in the parish of Paul, next to Mousehole.\n\nPerhaps due to poverty, Pentreath never married, but in 1729 she gave birth to a son, John Pentreath, who lived until 1778.\n\nPentreath is described as having been \"the old matriarch of the Cornish language [...] Dolly was a Cornish fishwife who tramped her fishy wares around Penwith and Penzance. At the latter place she gained the reputation of being the last native Cornish speaker, though she may not have been. Opinion is also divided about how much Cornish she could actually speak - though everyone agreed she could swear in Cornish.\" \n\nIn 1768, Daines Barrington searched Cornwall for speakers of the language and at Mousehole found Pentreath, then a fish seller said to be aged about 82, who \"could speak Cornish very fluently.\" In 1775 he published an account of her in the Society of Antiquaries' journal \"Archaeologia\" in an article called \"On the Expiration of the Cornish Language.\" Barrington noted that the \"hut in which she lived was in a narrow lane,\" and that in two rather better cottages just opposite it he had found two other women, some ten or twelve years younger than Pentreath, who could not speak Cornish readily, but who understood it. Five years later, Pentreath was said to be 87 years old and at the time her hut was \"poor and maintained mostly by the parish, and partly by fortune telling and gabbling Cornish.\"\n\nIn the last years of her life, Pentreath became a local celebrity for her knowledge of Cornish. Around 1777, she was painted by John Opie (1761–1807), and in 1781 an engraving of her after Robert Scaddan was published.\n\nIn 1797, a Mousehole fisherman told Richard Polwhele (1760–1838) that William Bodinar \"used to talk with her for hours together in Cornish; that their conversation was understood by scarcely any one of the place; that both Dolly and himself could talk in English.\" Her own account as recorded by Daines Barrington indicates she also spoke English.\n\nDolly Pentreath has passed into legend for cursing people in a long stream of fierce Cornish whenever she became angry. Her death is seen as marking the death of Cornish as a community language.\n\nThere are many tales about her. She was said often to curse people, including calling them \"\"kronnekyn hager du\",\" an \"ugly black toad,\" and was even said to have been a witch. Numerous other stories have been attached to her, their accuracy unknown. She was at one time thought to have been identical with a Dorothy Jeffrey or Jeffery whose burial is recorded in the Paul parish register, but this has been doubted (however the \"Oxford DNB\" (2004) does accept the identification).\n\nDolly Pentreath was buried at Paul, where in 1860 a monument in her honour was set into the churchyard wall of the church of St Paul Aurelian by Louis Lucien Bonaparte, a nephew of Napoleon, and by the Vicar of Paul of the time. It read: \n\nContradicting the monument, in 1882 Dr Frederick Jago of Plymouth received a letter from Bernard Victor, of Mousehole, who wrote \"She died Decr. 26, 1777, at the age of 102. At her funeral the undertaker was George Badcock. He being my grandfather, that is the reason I am so well informed ; and there were eight chosen fishermen bearers to take her to her last resting place. There was not anything erected on the old lady's grave as a tablet to her memory. I know quite well the grave where her remains are deposited.\" In a later letter he went on to say that it was no surprise that Bonaparte and Garret had mistaken both the date and the place of the grave. \"Dolly's actual resting place is 47 feet south-east, a point easterly from Prince L. L. Bonaparte's monument to her. It is not to be said that the monument is in its right place, because it was put there by the order of Prince L. L. Bonaparte, or by the Rev. John Garrett – the one a Frenchman and the other an Irishman!\" However, the erroneous idea that Pentreath had lived to be 102 is believed to originate in a Cornish language epitaph which had been written by December 1789 and published in 1806 by a man named Tomson.\n\nNo burial of Dorothy Pentreath is recorded, but it has been argued that this appears in the parish register under the name of Dolly Jeffery, which is suggested to be the surname of her son's father. This theory is accepted by the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\".\n\nIn 1887, the monument was moved to the site of her unmarked grave, and a skeleton was disinterred which was believed to be hers. Pêr-Jakez Helias, the Breton writer, has dedicated a poem to Dolly Pentreath.\n\nAs with many other \"last native speakers,\" there is controversy over Pentreath's status. Her true claim to notability is not as the last speaker of the language, but rather as its last fluent native speaker.\n\nAfter her death, Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar (or Bodener) stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.\n\nThere is one known traditional Cornish speaker, John Mann, who as a child in Boswednack, Zennor, always conversed in Cornish with other children, and was alive at the age of 80 in 1914. He was the last known survivor of a number of traditional Cornish speakers of the 19th century including Jacob Care of St Ives (d. 1892); Elizabeth Vingoe of Higher Boswarva, Madron (d. 1903 and who taught at least some Cornish to her son); John Davey junior (d. 1891) and senior, of Boswednack; Anne Berryman (1766–1854), also of Boswednack. Matthias Wallis of St. Buryan certified in 1859 that his grandmother, Ann Wallis, who had died around 1844, had spoken Cornish well. He also stated that a Jane Barnicoate, who had died about 1857, could speak Cornish too.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9858001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9858001", "title": "Empty category principle", "text": "Empty category principle\n\nIn linguistics, the empty category principle (ECP) was proposed in Noam Chomsky's syntactic framework of government and binding theory. The ECP is supposed to be a universal syntactic constraint that requires certain types of empty categories, namely traces, to be properly governed.\n\nECP is a principle of transformational grammar by which traces must be visible, i.e. they must be identifiable as empty positions in the surface structure, similar to the principle of reconstruction for deletion. Thus an empty category is in a position subcategorized for by a verb. In government and binding theory this is known as \"proper government\". Proper government occurs either if the empty position is governed by a lexical category (especially if it is not a subject) (theta-government) or if it is coindexed with a maximal projection which governs it (antecedent-government). The ECP has been revised many times and is now a central part of government and binding theory.\n\nIn spite of its name, the ECP applies to only two of the four types of empty category. The chief function of the ECP is to place constraints on the movement of categories by the rule of move α; it effectively allows a tree structure to \"remember\" what has happened at earlier stages of a derivation, and it can be seen as GB's version of the older derivational constraints.\n\nFormally, the ECP states that:\n\nThe ECP is a way of accounting for, among other things, the empirical fact that it is generally more difficult to move up a \"wh\"-word from a subject position than from an object position.\n\nThe intermediate traces must be deleted because they cannot be properly governed; theta-government is impossible because of the position they occupy, Spec-CP; the only possible antecedent-governor might be an overt NP (a wh-word), but the Minimality Condition would always be violated because of the tensed I (which must be present in all matrix clauses), the tensed I would c-command the intermediate trace but it would not c-command the wh-word. So we have to say that intermediate traces must be deleted at logical form so that they can avoid the ECP.\n\nIn the case of \"object extraction\" (the trace is a complement of VP), theta-government is the only possible option. In the case of subject extraction (the trace in Spec-IP), antecedent-government is the only possible option.\n\nIf the trace is in Spec-IP and we have an overt complementizer (such as \"that\"), the sentence is ungrammatical because the ECP is violated. The closest potential governor would be the complementizer, which cannot antecedent-govern the trace because it is not coindexed with it (and theta-government is impossible since trace is in Spec-IP).\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"Who do you think (that) John will invite?\" the ECP works in the following way (the structure is given for the embedded clause only):\n\n\n"}

{"id": "861492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=861492", "title": "Intercultural communication", "text": "Intercultural communication\n\nIntercultural communication (or cross-cultural communication) is a discipline that studies communication across different cultures and social groups, or how culture affects communication. It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and perceive the world around them. Many people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted. \nWith regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds \"interact\". Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. Intercultural communication plays a role in social sciences such as anthropology, cultural studies, linguistics, psychology and communication studies. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills. Research is a major part of the development of intercultural communication skills.\n\nIdentity and culture are also studied within the discipline of communication to analyze how globalization influences ways of thinking, beliefs, values, and identity, within and between cultural environments. Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society.\n\nThe study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding. \"Intercultural communication\" is in a way the 'interaction with speakers of other languages on equal terms and respecting their identities'.\n\nCross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content. The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.\n\nImportant points to consider:\n\n\nThere is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment—including the ability to communicate within that environment.\n\nTwo key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extrovertedness, and open-mindedness. Resilience includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.\n\nThese factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of preparedness for change, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.\n\nThere are common conceptualizations of attributes that define collectivistic and individualistic cultures. Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.\n\nGlobalization plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies. Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers. The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.\n\nThe Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and also what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells Praxis Model.\n\nThe problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.\n\nNonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.\n\nEffective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.\n\nThe following types of theories can be distinguished in different strands: focus on effective outcomes, on accommodation or adaption, on identity negotiation and management, on communication networks,on acculturation and adjustment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.\n\nIntercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness: Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.\n\n\nCompetent communication is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.\n\nIntercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.\n\nEthnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.\n\nPeople must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.\n\n\nThe following are ways to improve communication competence:\n\n\n\nVerbal communication consist of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.\n\nFactors that affect verbal communication:\n\n\nThe way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.\n\nAlong with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.\n\nExample of non-verbal cues\n\n\nIn terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties. Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.\n\nNonverbal communication is behavior that communicates without words—though it often may be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties.\n\nKinesic behavior is communication through body movement—e.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries.\n\nOcculesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages.\n\nProxemics concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany.\n\nParalanguage refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said—e.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence.\n\nObject language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts—e.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often.\n\nClothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication.\n\nCross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as cultural anthropology and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.\n\nCross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include anthropology, cultural studies, psychology and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by co-cultural populations, i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.\n\nThe study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.\n\nLanguage socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”. It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant. One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication. There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations. A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.\n\n"}

Born in Boroujerd, Iran, Shahidi dedicated his life to Persian studies, acting as the director of the Dehkhoda Dictionary Institute and International Centre for Persian language, serving as the Dean of the Faculty of Literature and Humanities at the University of Tehran (UT) and mastering the fields of jurisprudence and Islamic history. As a member of the Faculty of Literature and Humanities at the University of Tehran, Shahidi specialized in the study of Persian language and literature as well as Islamic theology, jurisprudence, and history.\n\nShahidi was a prominent disciple of Ali Akbar Dehkhoda and Badiozzaman Forouzanfar. He served as a seminary in Qom and Najaf under notable figures such as Tabatabaei, Seyed Hossein Boroujerdi, S. Khoi A. under whom he attained his degree in ijtihad. He is most notable for his works on the Dehkhoda encyclopedic dictionary of the Persian language and his research in Islamic history and religion.\n\nIn his later years, he served as the President of the Dehkhoda Institute and founder of the International Center for Persian Studies.\n\nSeyed Jafar Shahidi was born in the town of Boroujerd, Iran. His father, Mohammad Sajjadi was a leading Iranian scholar who died shortly after the birth of his son. Spending the first few years of his education in his hometown, Shahidi continued his academics in the capital city of Tehran.\n\nIn 1941, he moved to the town of Najaf, Iraq to pursue his studies in the field of Islamic jurisprudence and successfully surpassed the highest levels of education to receive the title of mujtahid. From there onward, Shahidi moved to Qom, Iran where he was mentored by the leading scholars, most notably Ayatollah Boroujerdi. Falling ill, Shahidi resorted to the translation of Arabic in Iran alongside Doctor Sanjabi (the then Minister of Culture). He later received an offer to teach at the Abu Muslem school.\n\nEncounters with Dr. Mohammad Moin permitted his close relationship with Ali Akbar Dehkhoda who later entrusted Shahidi as the director of the Dehkhoda Institute. In a letter to the then Minister of Culture, Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda wrote, \"Shahidi is rare in his abilities as a scholar,\" noting that he wished to limit his hours at the institute from twenty-two to eight in order for Shahidi to be able to continue his teachings as well.\n\nDr. Shahidi played a pivotal role in the formation and compilation of the second largest Persian lexicon, known as the Moeen Encyclopedia. Shahidi was entrusted with the completion and publishing of the text upon Dr. Mohammad Moin's death in 1971.\n\nIn 1991, Dr. Shahidi donated his residential house to the Narmak Municipality of Tehran where it remains today as the Dr. Shahidi Public Library.\n\n\nAs Author\n\nOver 100 articles written in Persian and Arabic include but are not limited to:\n\n\nAs Translator\nTranslations dually translated in the languages of Arabic, Turkish, German, and Greek include but are not limited to:\n\nAs Editor\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1034225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1034225", "title": "Missing person", "text": "Missing person\n\nA missing person is a person who has disappeared and whose status as alive or dead cannot be confirmed as his or her location and fate are not known.\n\nA person may go missing through a voluntary disappearance, or else due to an accident, crime, death in a location where they cannot be found (such as at sea), or many other reasons. In most parts of the world, a missing person will usually be found quickly. While criminal abductions are some of the most widely reported missing person cases, these account for only 2–5% of missing children in Europe.\n\nBy contrast, some missing person cases remain unresolved for many years. Laws related to these cases are often complex since, in many jurisdictions, relatives and third parties may not deal with a person's assets until their death is considered proven by law and a formal death certificate issued. The situation, uncertainties, and lack of closure or a funeral resulting when a person goes missing may be extremely painful with long-lasting effects on family and friends.\n\nA number of organizations seek to connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations, including the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC), as well as national centers, including the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in the US, Missing People in the UK, Child Focus in Belgium, and The Smile of the Child in Greece.\n\nPeople disappear for many reasons. Some individuals choose to disappear alone. Reasons for non-identification may include:\n\n\n\nA common misconception is that a person must be absent for at least 24 hours before being legally classed as missing, but this is rarely the case. Law enforcement agencies often stress that the case should be reported as early as possible.\n\nIn most common law jurisdictions a missing person can be declared dead \"in absentia\" (or \"legally dead\") after seven years. This time frame may be reduced in certain cases, such as deaths in major battles or mass disasters such as the September 11 attacks.\n\nThere is often a racial disparity between a when a white person goes missing and when a black person goes missing. A person is considered missing by the police if they cannot be located and they did not leave of their own will. According to authors Seong-Jae Min & John C. Feaste, there has always been a history of the news favoring white individuals by providing them better news coverage than people of color. It is often that researchers find that African Americans are underrepresented in the media when missing Most missing persons cases in the news cover young Caucasian girls who as a result have a better chance of being found alive due to increased media attention. For example, in 2002, when a young Caucasian girl from Utah named Elizabeth Smart went missing, the media broadcast was worldwide. According to John C Feaste, after several months of searching, she was found alive. In comparison, when Alexis Patterson, a young black girl from Wisconsin went missing, she received no news coverage and is still missing to this day. In addition, when women of color go missing, the tone used by the newscasters is generally less empathetic and detailed than the compassionate language used when white women go missing.\n\nThere are several organizations that bring awareness and equality to missing people of color, such as the Black and Missing Foundation. This a non-profit organization founded in 2008. The Black and Missing Foundation's goal is to provide resources for families of missing people of color and educate minorities on personal safety, \n\nAdditionally, Deidra Robey helms a non profit organization called Black and Missing but not Forgotten. The organization is a network that provides families a way to spread the news quickly that a loved one is missing. To find a missing person you must know they are gone and without big media the chances of a person being found safe decreases drastically. The goal of these organization is to provide equal coverage for African Americans. Every human being deserves an equal chance at being found safe and sound and as a result these organizations are seeking to level the playing field.\n\nIn most countries, the police are the default agency for leading an investigation into a missing person case. Disappearances at sea are a general exception, as these require a specialized agency such as a coast guard. In many countries such as the United States, voluntary search and rescue teams can be called out to assist the police in the search. Rescue agencies such as fire departments, mountain rescue and cave rescue may also participate in cases that require their specialized resources.\n\nPolice forces such as Lancashire Constabulary stress the need to try to find the person quickly, to assess how vulnerable the person is and to search places that the person may have links to.\n\nVarious charities exist to assist the investigations into unsolved cases. These include the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in the US, Missing People in the UK, Child Focus in Belgium, and The Smile of the Child in Greece. Some missing person cases are given wide media coverage, with the searchers turning to the public for assistance. The persons' photographs may be displayed on bulletin boards, milk cartons, postcards, websites and social media to publicize their description.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" reported in 2012 that: \"It is estimated that some 8 million children go missing around the world each year.\" The BBC News reported that of the children who go missing worldwide, \"while usually the child is found quickly the ordeal can sometimes last months, even years.\"\n\nOver 305,000 people were reported missing in Australia from 2008-2015 (Bricknell, 2017), which is estimated to be one person reported missing every 18 minutes (Henderson, Henderson & Kienan, 2000). Around 38,159 missing person reports are made on average every year in Australia (Bricknell, 2017). James, Anderson and Putt (2008) found that around 12,001 females and 12,505 males went missing in Australia in 2008. \n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police missing child statistics for a ten-year period show a total of 60,582 missing children in 2007.\n\nThe founder of Jamaica's Hear the Children's Cry, child-rights advocate Betty Ann Blaine, asked the government to introduce missing-children legislation in Jamaica. She said in May 2015: \"Jamaica is facing a crisis of missing children. Every single month, we have approximately 150 reports of children who go missing. That is a crisis because we are only 2.7 million people.\" She said her organization would work with the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) to recommend a model law to the Parliament of Jamaica.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"The Huffington Post\" reported in 2012, over 140,000 children go missing each year, as calculated by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) of the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency.\n\nIn the United States, 800,000 children were going missing annually according to a 2002 government study. These figures have been widely circulated in the popular press.\n\nAs the findings from the 2002 Second National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children (NISMART–2) study summary by the US Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) indicate, a child can be missing for many reasons, including \"Nonfamily abductions\", \"Family abductions,\" \"Runaway/thrownaway episodes,\" \"Missing involuntary, lost, or injured events,\" and \"Missing benign explanation situations.\" NISMART–2 defined a missing child both with regard to children who were missing from their caretakers, and children who were missing from their caretakers and reported to an agency for assistance locating the missing children. NISMART–2 considered a child as missing \"when the child experienced a qualifying episode during which the child's whereabouts were unknown to the primary caretaker, with the result that the caretaker was alarmed for at least 1 hour and tried to locate the child. For an episode to qualify, the child had to be younger than 18 and the situation had to meet the specific criteria for one of the [above] NISMART–2 episode types.\" The study was based on data derived from four NISMART–2 studies – a Law Enforcement Study, National Household Surveys of both Adult Caretakers and Youth (using computer-aided telephone interviewing methodology), and a Juvenile Facilities Study. The study summary noted that \"it is important to recognize that nearly all of the caretaker missing children (1,312,800 or 99.8 percent) were returned home alive or located by the time the study data were collected. Only a fraction of a percent (0.2 percent or 2,500) of all caretaker missing children had not returned home or been located, and the vast majority of these were runaways from institutions ...\"\n\nThe United States' National Crime Information Center (NCIC) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, mandated by the National Child Search Assistance Act, maintains its own \"Missing Person File\" to which local police report people for whom they are searching. The NCIC \"Missing Person File\" does have a category that is entitled \"Juvenile\" or \"EMJ\", but that category does not reflect the total number of all juveniles reported missing to the NCIC, for whom local police are searching. The NCIC also uses its own classification criteria; it does not use the above NISMART definitions of what constitutes a missing child. The NCIC data is limited to individuals who have been reported to the NCIC as missing, and are being searched for, by local police. In addition, the EMJ category does not contain all reports of juveniles who have been reported missing to the NCIC. While the EMJ category holds records of some of the juveniles reported missing, the totals for the EMJ category excludes those juveniles recorded missing \"but\" who \"have a proven physical or mental disability ... are missing under circumstances indicating that they may be in physical danger ... are missing after a catastrophe ... [or] are missing under circumstances indicating their disappearance may not have been voluntary\". In 2013, the NCIC entered 445,214 \"EMJ\" reports (440,625 in the EMJ category under the age of 18; but 462,567 under the age of 18 in all categories, and 494,372 under the age of 21 in all categories), and NCIC's total reports numbered 627,911. Of the children under age 18, a total of 4,883 reports were classified as \"missing under circumstances indicating that the disappearance may not have been voluntary, i.e., abduction or kidnapping\" (9,572 under age 21), and an additional 9,617 as \"missing under circumstances indicating that his/her physical safety may be in danger\" (15,163 under age 21). The total missing person records entered into NCIC were 661,593 in 2012, 678,860 in 2011 (550,424 of whom were under 21), 692,944 in 2010 (531,928 of whom were under 18, and 565,692 of whom were under 21), and 719,558 in 2009. A total of 630,990 records were cleared or canceled during 2013. At end-of-year 2013, NCIC had 84,136 still-active missing person records, with 33,849 (40.2%) being of juveniles under 18, and 9,706 (11.5%) being of juveniles between 18 and 20.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, Utah, a filed missing persons report led to additional criminal leads which included an outstanding warrant for drug-related crimes pertaining to \"Marilee Joann Borden\" in conjunction with the discovery of a deceased person. Third parties are also available in the United States, but can be expensive yielding limited results. These resources are in the form of bounty hunters and private investigators.\n\n116 000 is the European hotline for missing children active in 26 countries in the EU as well as Albania and Serbia. The hotline was an initiative pushed for by Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing and sexually exploited children and realised through the European insititutions.\n\nThe Council of Europe estimates that about 1 in 5 children in Europe are victims of some form of sexual violence. In 70% to 85% of cases, the abuser is somebody the child knows and trusts. Child sexual violence can take many forms: sexual abuse within the family circle, child pornography and prostitution, corruption, solicitation via Internet and sexual assault by peers. In some of the cases, with no other available option, children flee their homes and care institutions, in search of a better and safer life.\n\nOf the 50–60% of child runaways reported by the 116 000 European missing children hotline network, 1 in 6 are assumed to rough sleep on the run, 1 in 8 resort to stealing to survive and 1 in 4 children are at serious risk of some form of abuse. The number of rough sleeping children across Europe is on the rise. These runaways fall into vulnerable situations of sexual abuse, alcohol abuse and drug abuse leading to depression. Runaways are 9 times likelier to have suicidal tendencies than other children. The Children's Society published a report in 2011 on recommendations to the government to keep child runaways safe.\nThe issue of child disappearances is increasingly recognized as a concern for national and international policy makers especially in cross border abduction cases, organized child trafficking and child pornography as well as the transient nature of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, over 15,000 unaccompanied and separated children claimed asylum in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland in 2009. The precarious situation of these children makes them particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses, rendering their protection critical, given the high risks to which they are exposed. Most of these children are boys aged 14 years and over, with diverse ethnic, cultural, religious and social backgrounds mainly originating from Afghanistan, Somalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea and Iraq.\n\nAmong exploiters taking advantage of the children, are sometimes their own relatives who gain benefit in the form of social and/or family allowances. According to research done by Frontex, some types of threats faced by unaccompanied migrant minors include sexual exploitation in terms of pornography, prostitution and the internet; economic exploitation including forced donation of organs; criminal exploitation including drug smuggling and child trafficking including forced marriage and begging.\n\nCriminal networks are heavily involved with human trafficking to the EU and this includes also exploitation of minors as manpower in the sex trade and other criminal activities. According to a 2007 UNICEF report on Child Trafficking in Europe, 2 million children are being trafficked in Europe every year. Child trafficking occurs in virtually all countries in Europe. There is no clear-cut distinction between countries of origin and destination in Europe. Trafficking in children has been perceived mainly in connection with sexual exploitation, but the reality is much more complex. Children in Europe are also trafficked for exploitation through labour, domestic servitude, begging, criminal activities and other exploitative purposes.\n\nIn the report, UNICEF also warns that there is a dramatic absence of harmonized and systematic data collection, analysis and dissemination at all levels without which countries lack important evidence that informs national policies and responses. Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing children, aims to meet this need. The CRM system is expected to have a clear impact on the way hotlines are able to work together and collect data on the problem of missing children.\n\nThe British Asylum Screening Unit estimated that 60% of the unaccompanied minors accommodated in social care centres in the UK go missing and are not found again. In the UK these open centres, from where minors are able to call their traffickers, act as 'human markets' for the facilitators and traffickers who generally collect their prey within 24 hours of arrival in the UK. According to the CIA out of the 800,000 people trafficked annually across national borders in the world, up to 50% are minors.\n\nThe United Nations is operating a Commission on Missing Persons that serves as an international coordination center and provides also statistical material regarding missing persons worldwide. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement strives to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons when loss of contact is due to armed conflict or other situations of violence; natural or man-made disaster; migration and in other situations of humanitarian need. It is also supporting the families of missing persons to rebuild their social lives and find emotional well-being.\n\nOn May 26, 2002, a monument to missing persons was unveiled in County Kilkenny, Republic of Ireland by President Mary McAleese. It was the first monument of its kind in the world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7623580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7623580", "title": "Mission statement", "text": "Mission statement\n\nA mission statement is a short statement of an organization's purpose, identifying the goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary customers or market, and its geographical region of operation. It may include a short statement of such fundamental matters as the organization's values or philosophies, a business's main competitive advantages, or a desired future state—the \"vision\".\n\nA mission is not simply a description of an organization by an external party, but an expression, made by its leaders, of their desires and intent for the organization. The purpose of a mission statement is to focus and direct the organization itself. It communicates primarily to the people who make up the organization—its members or employees—giving them a shared understanding of the organization's intended direction. Organizations normally do not change their mission statements over time, since they define their continuous, ongoing purpose and focus.\n\nAccording to Chris Bart, professor of strategy and governance at McMaster University, a commercial mission statement consists of three essential components:\n\n\nBart estimates that in practice, only about ten percent of mission statements say something meaningful. For this reason, they are widely regarded with contempt.\n\nThe sole purpose of a mission statement is to serve as a company's goal/agenda, it outlines clearly what the goal of the company is. Some generic examples of mission statements would be, \"To provide the best service possible within the banking sector for our customers.\" or \"To provide the best experience for all of our customers.\" The reason why businesses make use of mission statements is to make it clear what they look to achieve as an organization, not only to themselves and their employees but to the customers and other people who are a part of the business, such as shareholders. As a company evolves, so will their mission statement. This is to make sure that the company remains on track and to ensure that the mission statement does not lose its touch and become boring or stale.\n\nIt is important that a mission statement is not confused with a vision statement. As discussed earlier, the main purpose of a mission statement is to get across the ambitions of an organisation in a short and simple fashion, it is not necessary to go into detail for the mission statement which is evident in examples given. The reason why it is important that a mission statement and vision statement are not confused is because they both serve different purposes. Vision statements tend to be more related to strategic planning and lean more towards discussing where a company aims to be in the future.\n\nProvides direction: Mission statements are a way to direct a business into the right path. They play a part in helping the business make better decisions which can be beneficial to them. Without the mission statement providing direction, businesses may struggle when it comes to making decisions and planning for the future. This is why providing direction could be considered one of the most advantageous points of a mission statement.\n\nClear purpose: Having a clear purpose can remove any potential ambiguities that can surround the existence of a business. People who are interested in the progression of the business, such as stakeholders, will want to know that the business is making the right choices and progressing more towards achieving their goals, which will help to remove any doubt the stakeholders may have in the business.\n\nA mission statement can act as a motivational tool within an organisation, and it can allow employees to all work towards one common goal that benefits both the organisation and themselves. This can help with factors such as employee satisfaction and productivity. It is important that employees feel a sense of purpose. Giving them this sense of purpose will allow them to focus more on their daily tasks and help them to realise the goals of the organisation and their role.\n\nAlthough it is mostly beneficial for a business to craft a good mission statement, there are some situations where a mission statement can be considered pointless or not useful to a business.\n\nUnrealistic: In most cases, mission statements turn out to be unrealistic and far too optimistic. An unrealistic mission statement can also affect the performance and morale of the employees within the workplace. This is because an unrealistic mission statement would reduce the likelihood of employees being able to meet this standard which could demotivate employees in the long term. Unrealistic mission statements also serve no purpose and can be considered a waste of management's time. Another issue which could arise from an unrealistic mission statement is that poor decisions could be made in an attempt to achieve this goal which has the potential to harm the business and be seen as a waste of both time and resources.\n\nWaste of time and resources: Mission statements require planning. This takes time and effort for those who are responsible for creating the mission statement. If the mission statement is not achieved, then the process of creating the mission statement could be seen as a waste of time for all of the people involved. A lot of thought and time can be spent in designing a good mission statement, and to have all of that time wasted is not what businesses can afford. The wasted time could have been spent on much more important tasks within the organisation such as decision-making for the business.\n\nAccording to an independent contributor to Forbes, the following questions must be answered in the mission statement:\n\nWhen designing a mission statement, it should be very clear to the audience what the purpose of it is. It is ideal for a business to be able to communicate their mission, goals and objectives to the reader without including any unnecessary information through the mission statement.\n\nRichard Branson has commented on ways of crafting a good mission statement; he explains the importance of having a mission statement that is clear and straight to the point and does not contain unnecessary baffling. He went on to analyse a mission statement, using Yahoo's mission statement at the time (2013) as an example. In his evaluation of the mission statement, he seemed to suggest that while the statement sounded interesting, most people would not be able to understand the message it is putting across. In other words the message of the mission statement potentially meant nothing to the audience.\n"}

It was written using a variant of the Phoenician alphabet.\n\nMost knowledge about Moabite comes from the Mesha Stele, which is the only known extensive text in the language. In addition, there is the three-line El-Kerak Inscription and a few seals. The main features distinguishing Moabite from fellow Canaanite languages such as Hebrew are: a plural in \"-în\" rather than \"-îm\" (e.g. \"mlkn\" \"kings\" for Biblical Hebrew \"məlākîm\"), like Aramaic and Arabic; retention of the feminine ending \"-at\" or \"-ah\", which Biblical Hebrew reduces to \"-āh\" only (e.g. \"qiryat\" or \"qiryah\", \"town\", Biblical Hebrew \"qiryāh\") but retains in the construct state nominal form (e.g. \"qiryát yisrael\" \"town of Israel\"); and retention of a verb form with infixed \"-t-\", also found in Arabic and Akkadian (\"w-’ltḥm\" \"I began to fight\", from the root \"lḥm\").\n\nAccording to \"Glottolog\", referencing Huehnergard & Rubin (2011), Moabite was not a distinct language from Hebrew. Moabite differed only dialectally from Hebrew, and Moabite religion and culture was related to that of the Israelites. On the other hand, although Moabite itself had begun to diverge, the script used in the 9th century BC did not differ from the script used in Hebrew inscriptions at that time.\n\nWhile knowledge of Moabite is limited primarily to the Mesha Stele and a few seals, it is clear that Moabite is a dialect of Hebrew and is closely related to Phoenician, Ugaritic and Aramaic.\n\nMoabite appears to use a variant of the Phoenician alphabet, much like Paleo-Hebrew. Most of the letters don't seem to have changed in appearance in Moabite context, however a few have noticeable differences.\n"}

{"id": "707748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=707748", "title": "Official minority languages of Sweden", "text": "Official minority languages of Sweden\n\nIn 1999, the Minority Language Committee of Sweden formally declared five official minority languages: Finnish, Sami, Romani, Yiddish, and Meänkieli (Tornedal Finnish). \n\nThe Swedish language dominates commercial and cultural life in Sweden but did not officially become the country's main language until 2009, when a new language law entered into effect. The need for this legal status had been the subject of protracted debate and proposed legislation was narrowly defeated in 2005.\n\nThe minority languages have been legally recognized to protect the cultural and historical heritage of their respective speech communities. These communities are given certain rights on that basis, such as school education in their language, and its use in dealing with governmental agencies.\n\nThese are the criteria established by the Minority Language Committee, influenced by the directives from the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 1997.\n\nTo be accorded official minority status, a language must have been spoken in Sweden for a significant amount of time. A precise figure has not been revealed, but qualified estimations consider 100 years to be reasonable, based on the included and excluded languages. A significant immigration to Sweden did not start until after World War I, and many languages currently spoken by a large number of people in Sweden are excluded, among them Arabic and Persian. \n\nIt is also required that the language be spoken by a significant number of people and be centred in a specific geographical region (the latter, however, not applied for Romani and Yiddish).\n\nFurthermore, it is a condition that the granting of official minority language status should be of cultural benefit to the group speaking it. It is allegedly for this reason that Swedish Sign Language was not included – even though it is a unique language with a history dating back to the 18th century, it was considered to have a sufficiently stable basis already in Swedish culture. \n\nCommon culture is yet another criterion for inclusion.\n\nFinnish has been spoken in Sweden ever since the (then provincial) borders were drawn in the 13th century. Sweden has always had a significant migration to and from Finland. As the two languages belong to different language families it is easy to distinguish them, unlike the neighbouring languages Norwegian and Danish. The number of Finnish speakers in Sweden today has been estimated to over 460,000. Even though many current Swedes are of full or mixed Finnish descent, Swedish is the main language in practice for many bilinguals.\n\nFinnish and Meänkieli can be used in the northernmost municipalities of Gällivare, Haparanda, Kiruna, Pajala and Övertorneå and its immediate neighbourhood.\n\nOn 11 December, 2007, Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE reported, that in Uppsala, Sweden, speaking Finnish was forbidden from municipal employees, and that this was the case also with small talk during breaks. According to an agreement between the city council and the municipal trade union the official working language is Swedish and two employees were not allowed to speak Finnish with one another in the common work premises or in break rooms. The Equality Ombudsman considered that a ban was permissible in that particular case.\n\nMeänkieli or Tornionlaaksonsuomi or Tornedalian language is spoken by a population in northern Sweden. It is closely related to and mutually intelligible with Finnish and often considered a dialect thereof, with many loanwords from Swedish. Especially in Finland the distinction of Meänkieli as a separate language is seen as language politics not based in linguistics (see Kven language for a similar situation in Norway). Meänkieli and Swedish are not mutualy inteligible. The number of speakers amount to 50,000 or so.\n\nThe Sami languages are actually not one language, even though they are commonly referred to as such. In Sweden, three Sámi languages are spoken, with the other 7 Sámi languages being spoken in Norway, Russia and Finland. The history of the Sami languages can be traced back at least 2,000 years. In total, they are spoken by a minimum of 40,000 people throughout the four countries.\n\nAs a minority language, Sami is an official language and may be used in government agencies, courts, preschools and nursing homes in the municipalities where it is most common. \n\nRomani chib, the language of Romani people, has been spoken in Sweden since the 16th century. Today about 9,500 people speak it in Sweden. It does not have a geographical center, but is considered to be of historical importance.\n\nYiddish has been a common language of Ashkenazi (Central and Eastern European) Jews since early in their history. The first Jews were permitted to reside in Sweden during the late 18th century.\nAs of 2009, the Jewish population in Sweden was estimated at around 20,000. Out of these 2,000-6,000 claim to have at least some knowledge of Yiddish according to various reports and surveys. The number of native speakers among these has been estimated by linguist Mikael Parkvall to be 750-1,500. It is believed that virtually all native speakers of Yiddish in Sweden today are adults, and most of them elderly.\n\nThe organization \"Sveriges Jiddischförbund\" (Yiddish Association of Sweden) has been the national parent organization for Yiddish speakers and has four local chapters in Borås, Gothenburg, Stockholm and Malmö. It has been active since 1976 and was previously known as \"Sällskapet för jiddisch och jiddischkultur i Sverige\" (The Society for Yiddish and Yiddish Culture in Sweden) which is now the name of the chapter based in Stockholm.\n\nRomani and Yiddish have minority language status throughout the country and are covered by government obligations regarding their preservation.\n\n\n"}

He is the author of \"Maila Anchal\", which after Premchand's \"Godaan\", is regarded as the most significant Hindi novel. Phanishwar Nath (Mandal) Renu was born on 4 March 1921 in a small village Aurahi Hingna near Simraha railway station in Bihar. The Mandal (surname) community to which Renu belonged constitutes an under-privileged social group in India. Renu's family, however, enjoyed the benefits of land, education, and social prestige. Renu's father, Shilanath Mandal, had been active in the Indian National Movement and was an extremely enlightened individual, taking a keen interest in modern ideas, culture and art.\n\nPhanishwar Nath 'Renu' is best known for promoting the voice of the contemporary rural India through the genre of 'Aanchalik Upanyas' (Regional Story), and is placed amongst the pioneering Hindi writers who brought regional voices into the mainstream Hindi literature. Renu was very close associate of Bengali novelist Satinath Bhaduri. He wrote a memoirs named \"Bhaduriji\" (Mr. Bhaduri) in Bengali.\n\nHis short story \"Maare Gaye Gulfam\" was adapted into a film \"Teesri Kasam\" (The Third Vow), by Basu Bhattacharya (produced by the poet-lyricist Shailendra) in 1966 for which he also wrote the dialogues. Later his short story \"Panchlight\" (Petromax) was made into a TV short film. The 2017 Bollywood Film \"Panchlait\" is also based on this short story.\n\nPhanishwar Nath 'Renu' was born on 4 March 1921 at village Aurahi Hingna near Forbesganj, in Araria district (then Purnia district), Bihar. He was educated in India and Nepal. His primary education was held in Araria and Forbesganj. He did his Matriculation from Biratnagar Adarsh Vidyalaya(school), Biratnagar, Nepal while staying with Koirala Family. After Passing out IA from Kashi Hindu Vishvavidyalay (university) in 1942 he took part in the Indian Freedom Struggle. Later he participated in the Nepali revolutionary movement in 1950 which resulted in the establishment of democracy in Nepal. He ushered in 'Anchalik-katha' (Regional Story) of Hindi writing. He had a very close friendship with Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayana Agyey - his contemporary poet. A biography on the writer has also been produced with the name: Phanishwar Nath ‘Renu’ in Unki Nazar Unka Shahar.\n\nHis first novel which is also considered his masterpiece, \"Maila Anchal\" (The Soiled Linen, 1954), was a social novel that depicted the life of rural Bihar and its people, especially the backward and the deprived. He was subsequently awarded one of India's highest civilian honours, the Padma Sri in 1970. He returned the Padma Sri in protest of the proclamation of Internal Emergency.\n\n\n\nHe was married twice, first wife was Padma, while second Latika (d. 2011). He met his second wife, a nurse while admitted at Patna Medical College and Hospital. They married in 1951. She has been the inspiration behind, \"Maila Anchal\", \"Parti Parikatha\" and \"Mare Gaye Gulfam\".

A \"primate city distribution\" is a rank-size distribution that has one very large city with many much smaller cities and towns, and no intermediate-sized urban centres: a King effect, visible as an outlier on an otherwise linear graph, when the rest of the data fit a power law or stretched exponential function. The \"law of the primate city\" was first proposed by the geographer Mark Jefferson in 1939. He defines a primate city as being \"at least twice as large as the next largest city and more than twice as significant.\" Aside from size and economic influence, a primate city will usually have precedence in all other aspects of its country's society, such as being a center of politics, media, culture and education and receive most internal migration.\n\nNot all countries have primate cities, but in those that do, the rest of the country depends on it for cultural, economic, political, and major transportation needs. On the other hand, the primate city depends on the rest of the country as paying consumers of the cultural, economic, political and other services produced in the area.\n\nThe presence of a primate city in a country may indicate an imbalance in development – usually a progressive core, and a lagging periphery, on which the city depends for labor and other resources. However, the urban structure is not directly dependent on a country's level of economic development.\n\nMany of the primate cities are increasing their percentage of their country's population. This can be because the number of traditional workers have been reduced because of mechanization in the manufacturing industry, agriculture, and other blue-collar industries, which are generally located throughout all of the country. At the same time, the number of educated employees in service business such as politics, economy, culture, media, and higher education has been rising, and those sectors are often located in the capital where the power and money is concentrated.\n\nMany alpha world cities are considered national and/or regional primate cities. They include the two alpha++ world cities of London in the United Kingdom (national) and New York City in the United States (regional), though the U.S. has never had any primate city on a national scale. In addition, Budapest, Dublin, Jakarta, Lima, Mexico City, Cape Town and Seoul have also been described as primate cities within their respective countries.\n\nBangkok, the capital of Thailand, has been called \"the most primate city on Earth\", being roughly thirty-five times larger than Thailand's second-largest city of Nakhon Ratchasima. Taking the concept from his examination of the primate city during the 2010 Thai political protests and applying it to the role that primate cities play if they are national capitals, Jack Fong's study noted that when primate cities like Bangkok function as national capitals, they are inherently vulnerable to insurrectionary dynamics by the subaltern, and the dispossessed. He cites the simple fact that most primate cities serving as national capitals contain major headquarters for the country. Thus, logistically, it is rather \"efficient\" for national targets to be contested since they are all located within one major urban environment.\n\nUrban primacy indicates the ratio of the primate city to the next largest i.e the second largest in a country or region. In other words, urban primacy can be defined as the central place in an urban or city network that has acquired or obtained a great level of dominance. The level of dominance is measured by population density and the number of functions offered. Higher functions and population will result in higher dominance.\n\n"}

He studied at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration. He has worked as a war correspondent and written books about the Middle East, geopolitics and international relations.\n\nHe is an advocate of political realism. One of his concepts is that of the \"principal enemy\" (\"ennemi principal\"), which constitutes a hierarchy of political priorities. For example, in the Syrian Civil War, he considers the principal enemy to be Sunni jihadists, which makes it acceptable to seek alliances with Shi'a Islamist groups such as Hezbollah. Another concept he uses is that of \"blatant evil\" (\"mal flagrant\"), which creates distinctions between different dictatorships. A dictatorship may be deserving of strong criticism, but at the same time not legitimize mass murder or strive for unlimited expansion, in which case it can not be considered as blatantly evil. This is exemplified by the regimes of Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad. On the other hand, NS Germany and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant are examples which Girard regards as blatantly evil.\n\nGirard is very critical of the neoconservative movement and its doctrine of trying to impose democracy on other countries by force. He has argued that the United States under George W. Bush prioritized democracy in Iraq over the prospect of peace, which only lead to failure and took the country further from democracy than it was when the operation began.\n\n"}

In this approach, words that don’t contribute to the representation are void; they can only provide a figurative expression. Examples of phrases which lack a secondary reference are 'a black Monday' (unless it is used figuratively) and Bernard Bolzano's 'round quadrangle'. Alexius Meinong's Types of objects can be mentioned here, too.\n\nIn the first case, one may have a representation of a Monday (or at least of something one calls a Monday), as well as of something black, but not of a 'black Monday', since these qualities don’t combine ('Monday' being too abstract to be combined with a concrete quality such as a color). In the second case, there is an incongruity: a quadrangle can be represented, but not a round one; conversely, there can be a circle, but it can’t be square. It may, therefore, be debated whether a representation is created here.\n\nAnother example is presented by George Berkeley. He says: \"[...] Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive and difficult) for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but \"all and none\" of these at once?\" (\"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\", Introduction, section 13.) Berkeley is here criticizing John Locke, demonstrating that each representation is particular (i.e., individual).\n\nWhether there is a meaning or not depends on the individual person: it is possible that a sentence has a meaning according to A, whereas B can’t discern any. This may, e.g., result from relevant knowledge which A possesses and B lacks, as in the case where one should decide the answer to the question 'Is 15 a prime number?' and A knows what a prime number is and B doesn’t; the sentence then doesn’t have a meaning for B.\n\n"}
{"id": "1688561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1688561", "title": "Specific language impairment", "text": "Specific language impairment\n\nSpecific language impairment (SLI) is diagnosed when a child's language does not develop normally and the difficulties cannot be accounted for by generally slow development, physical abnormality of the speech apparatus, autism spectrum disorder, apraxia, acquired brain damage or hearing loss. Twin studies have shown that it is under genetic influence. Although language impairment can result from a single-gene mutation, this is unusual. More commonly SLI results from the combined influence of multiple genetic variants, each of which is found in the general population, as well as environmental influences.\n\nSpecific language impairment (SLI) is diagnosed when a child has delayed or disordered language development for no apparent reason. Usually the first indication of SLI is that the child is later than usual in starting to speak and subsequently is delayed in putting words together to form sentences. Spoken language may be immature. In many children with SLI, understanding of language, or \"receptive\" language, is also impaired, though this may not be obvious unless the child is given a formal assessment.\n\nAlthough difficulties with use and understanding of complex sentences are a common feature of SLI, the diagnostic criteria encompass a wide range of problems, and for some children other aspects of language are problematic (see below). In general, the term SLI is reserved for children whose language difficulties persist into school age, and so it would not be applied to toddlers who are late to start talking, most of whom catch up with their peer group after a late start.\n\nThe terminology for children's language disorders is extremely wide-ranging and confusing, with many labels that have overlapping but not necessarily identical meanings. In part this confusion reflects uncertainty about the boundaries of SLI, and the existence of different subtypes. Historically, the terms \"developmental dysphasia\" or \"developmental aphasia\" were used to describe children with the clinical picture of SLI. These terms have, however, largely been abandoned, as they suggest parallels with adult acquired aphasia. This is misleading, as SLI is not caused by brain damage.\n\nSome synonyms currently in use for specific language impairment are language impairment, developmental language delay (DLD), language disorder, and language-learning disability. Researcher Bonnie Brinton argues that the term \"specific language impairment\" is misleading because the disorder does not only affect language, but also affects reading, writing, and social/pragmatics. \n\nIn medical circles, terms such as \"specific developmental language disorder\" are often used, but this has the disadvantage of being wordy, and is also rejected by some people who think SLI should not be seen as a \"disorder\". In the UK educational system, \"speech, language and communication needs\" (SLCN) is currently the term of choice, but this is far broader than SLI, and includes children with speech and language difficulties arising from a wide range of causes.\n\nAlthough most experts agree that children with SLI are quite variable, there is little agreement on how best to subtype them. There is no widely accepted classification system. In 1983 Rapin and Allen proposed a classification of developmental language disorders based on the linguistic features of language impairment, which was subsequently updated by Rapin. Note that Rapin is a child neurologist, and she refers to different subtypes as \"syndromes\"; many of those coming from the perspective of education or speech-language therapy reject this kind of medical label, and argue that there is not a clear dividing line between SLI and normal variation. Also, although most experts would agree that children with characteristics of the Rapin subtypes can be identified, there are many cases who are less easy to categorise, and there is also evidence that categorisation can change over time.\n\nRapin's subgroups fall into three broad categories:\n\nReceptive/expressive phonologic/syntactic deficit syndrome is the most common form of SLI, in which the child's most obvious problems are a tendency to speak in short, simplified sentences, with omission of some grammatical features, such as past tense -ed. It is common also to see simplified speech production when the child is young. For instance, clusters of consonants may be reduced, so that \"string\" is pronounced as \"ting\". Vocabulary is often limited, with a tendency to use \"general all-purpose\" terms, rather than more specific words.\n\nVerbal auditory agnosia is a very rare form of language impairment, in which the child appears unable to make sense of speech sounds. It typically occurs as a symptom of Landau-Kleffner syndrome, in which case a diagnosis of SLI would not be appropriate, as there is a known neurological origin of the language difficulties.\n\nDevelopmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD)￼￼ – in the child with DVD, comprehension is adequate; the onset of speech is very delayed and extremely limited with impaired production of speech sounds and short utterances. The poor speech production cannot be explained in terms of structural or neurological damage of the articulators. There is much disagreement about diagnostic criteria, but the label most often used for children whose intelligibility declines markedly when they attempt complex utterances, compared to when they are producing individual sounds or syllables.\n\nAnother key feature is inconsistency of speech sound production from one occasion to another. Although the term \"dyspraxia\" suggests a pure output disorder, many – perhaps all – of these children have difficulty in doing tasks that involve mentally manipulating speech sounds, such as phonological awareness tasks. Children with DVD also typically have major literacy problems, and receptive language levels may be poor on tests of vocabulary and grammar.\n\nPhonologic programming deficit syndrome – the child speaks in long but poorly intelligible utterances, producing what sounds like jargon. Outside Rapin's group, little has been written about this subtype, which is not generally recognised in diagnostic frameworks.\n\nLexical deficit disorder – the child has word finding problems and difficulty putting ideas into words. There is poor comprehension for connected speech. Again, there is little research on this subtype, which is not widely recognised.\n\nPragmatic language impairment – the child speaks in fluent and well-formed utterances with adequate articulation; content of language is unusual; comprehension may be over-literal and language use is odd. The child may chatter incessantly and be poor at turn-taking in conversation and maintaining a topic. There has been a great deal of controversy about this category, which is termed \"pragmatic language impairment (PLI)\" in the UK. Debate has centred over the question of whether it is a subtype of SLI, part of the autistic spectrum, or a separate condition. In DSM-5, the term \"Social Communication Disorder\" has been introduced; this is equivalent to PLI.\n\nAlthough textbooks draw clear boundaries between different neurodevelopmental disorders, there is much debate about overlaps between them. Many children with SLI meet diagnostic criteria for developmental dyslexia, and others have features of autism.\n\nSLI is defined purely in behavioural terms: there is no biological test for SLI. There are three points that need to be met for a diagnosis of SLI:\nThere is considerable variation in how this last criterion is implemented. Tombin et al. (1996) proposed the EpiSLI criterion, based on five composite scores representing performance in three domains of language (vocabulary, grammar, and narration) and two modalities (comprehension and production). Children scoring in the lowest 10% on two or more composite scores are identified as having language disorder.\n\nAssessment will usually include an interview with the child's caregiver, observation of the child in an unstructured setting, a hearing test, and standardized tests of language and nonverbal ability. There is a wide range of language assessments in English. Some are restricted for use by speech and language professionals (therapists or SALTs in the UK, speech-language pathologists, SLPs, in the US and Australia).\nA commonly used test battery for diagnosis of SLI is the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF). Assessments that can be completed by a parent or teacher can be useful to identify children who may require more in-depth evaluation.\n\nThe Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test is a quick (ten minute) simple and accurate screening test developed and standardized in the UK. It is suitable for children from 3;4 to 6;8 years;months and can be administered by professionals and non-professionals (including parents) alike, and has been demonstrated to be highly accurate (98% accuracy) in identifying impaired children who need specialist help vs non-impaired children. This makes it potentially a feasible test for widespread screening.\n\nThe Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC–2) is a parent questionnaire suitable for testing language skills in school-aged children.\nInformal assessments, such as language samples, may also be used. This procedure is useful when the normative sample of a given test is inappropriate for a given child, for instance, if the child is bilingual and the sample was of monolingual children. It is also an ecologically valid measure of all aspects of language (e.g. semantics, syntax, pragmatics, etc.).\n\nTo complete a language sample, the SLP will spend about 15 minutes talking with the child. The sample may be of a conversation (Hadley, 1998), or narrative retell. In a narrative language sample, the SLP will tell the child a story using a wordless picture book (e.g. \"Frog Where Are You?\", Mayer, 1969), then ask the child to use the pictures and tell the story back.\n\nLanguage samples are typically transcribed using computer software such as the systematic analysis of language software (SALT, Miller et al. 2012), and then analyzed. For example, the SLP might look for whether the child introduces characters to their story or jumps right in, whether the events follow a logical order, and whether the narrative includes a main idea or theme and supporting details.\n\nEpidemiological surveys, in the US and Canada, estimated the prevalence of SLI in five-year-olds at around 7%. However, neither study adopted the stringent \"discrepancy\" criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or ICD-10; SLI was diagnosed if the child scored below cut-off on standardized language tests, but had a nonverbal IQ of 90 or above and no other exclusionary criteria.\n\nLongitudinal studies indicate that problems are largely resolved by five years in around 40% of 4-year-olds with SLI. However, for children who still have significant language difficulties at school entry low levels of literacy are common, even for children who receive specialist help, and educational attainments are typically poor. Poor outcomes are most common in cases where comprehension as well as expressive language is affected. There is also evidence that the nonverbal IQ of children with SLI decreases over the course of development.\n\nSLI is associated with a high rate of psychiatric disorder. For instance, Conti-Ramsden and Botting (2004) found that 64% of a sample of 11-year-olds with SLI scored above a clinical threshold on a questionnaire for psychiatric difficulties, and 36% were regularly bullied, compared with 12% of comparison children. In the longer-term, studies of adult outcomes of children with SLI find elevated rates of unemployment, social isolation and psychiatric disorder. However, most studies focused on children with severe problems, where comprehension as well as expressive language was affected. Better outcomes are found for children who have milder difficulties and do not require special educational provision.\n\nIt is now generally accepted that SLI is a strongly genetic disorder. The best evidence comes from studies of twins. Two twins growing up together are exposed to the same home environment, yet may differ radically in their language skills. Such different outcomes are, however, seen almost exclusively in fraternal (non-identical) twins, who are genetically different. Identical twins share the same genes and tend to be much more similar in language ability.\n\nThere can be some variation in the severity and persistence of SLI in identical twins, indicating that environmental factors affect the course of disorder, but it is unusual to find a child with SLI who has an identical twin with normal language.\n\nSLI is not usually caused by a mutation in a single gene. Current evidence suggests that there are many different genes that can influence language learning, and SLI results when a child inherits a particularly detrimental combination of risk factors, each of which may have only a small effect. It has been hypothesized, however, that a mutation of the FOXP2 gene may have an influence on the development on SLI to a certain degree, as it regulates genes pertinent to neural pathways related to language.\n\nOnly a handful of non-genetic factors have been found selectively to impact on language development in children. Later-born children in large families are at greater risk than earlier born.\n\nOverall, genetic mutation, hereditary influences, and environmental factors may all have a role in the development and manifestation of SLI. It is important, therefore, to not associate the development to a single factor, but recognize that it is oftentimes the result of complex interactions between any or all of these factors.\n\nMuch research has focused on trying to identify what makes language learning so hard for some children. A major divide is between theories that attribute the difficulties to a low-level problem with auditory temporal processing, and those that propose there is a deficit in a specialised language-learning system. Other accounts emphasise deficits in specific aspects of memory. It can be difficult to choose between theories because they do not always make distinctive predictions, and there is considerable heterogeneity among children with SLI. It has also been suggested that SLI may only arise when more than one underlying deficit is present.\n\nMales are more affected by SLI than females. In clinical samples, the sex ratio of affected males: females is around 3 or 4:1. The reason for this association is not known: no linkage has been found to genes on the sex chromosomes.\nPoor motor skills are commonly found in children with SLI. Brain scans do not usually reveal any obvious abnormalities in children with SLI, although quantitative comparisons have found differences in brain size or relative proportions of white or grey matter in specific regions. In some cases, unusual brain gyri are found. To date, no consistent \"neural signature\" for SLI has been found. Differences in the brains of children with SLI vs typically developing children are subtle and may overlap with atypical patterns seen in other neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nIntervention is usually carried out by speech and language therapists, who use a wide range of techniques to stimulate language learning. In the past, there was a vogue for drilling children in grammatical exercises, using imitation and elicitation methods, but such methods fell into disuse when it became apparent that there was little generalisation to everyday situations. Contemporary approaches to enhancing development of language structure are more likely to adopt 'milieu' methods, in which the intervention is interwoven into natural episodes of communication, and the therapist builds on the child's utterances, rather than dictating what will be talked about. In addition, there has been a move away from a focus solely on grammar and phonology toward interventions that develop children's social use of language, often working in small groups that may include typically developing as well as language-impaired peers.\n\nAnother way in which modern approaches to remediation differ from the past is that parents are more likely to be directly involved, particularly with preschool children.\n\nA radically different approach has been developed by Tallal and colleagues, who have devised a computer-based intervention, Fast Forword, that involves prolonged and intensive training on specific components of language and auditory processing. The theory underlying this approach maintains that language difficulties are caused by a failure to make fine-grained auditory discriminations in the temporal dimension, and the computerised training materials are designed to sharpen perceptual acuity.\n\nFor all these types of intervention, there are few adequately controlled trials that allow one to assess clinical efficacy. In general, where studies have been done, results have been disappointing, though some more positive outcomes have been reported. In 2010, a systematic review of clinical trials assessing the FastForword approach was published, and reported no significant gains relative to a control group.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6635979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6635979", "title": "Ukrainian grammar", "text": "Ukrainian grammar\n\nThe grammar of the Ukrainian language describes the phonological, morphological, and syntactical rules of the Ukrainian language. Ukrainian contains 7 cases and 2 numbers for its nominal declension and 2 aspects, 3 tenses, 3 moods, and 2 voices for its verbal conjugation. Adjectives must agree in number, gender, and case with their nouns.\n\nIn order to understand Ukrainian grammar, it is necessary to understand the various phonological rules that occur due to the collision of two or more sounds. Doing so markedly decreases the number of exceptions and makes understanding the rules better. The origin of some of these phonological rules can be traced all the way back to Indo-European gradation (ablaut). This is especially common in explaining the differences between the infinitive and present stem of many verbs.\n\nThis article presents the grammar of the literary language, which is followed by most dialects. The main differences in the dialects are vocabulary with occasional differences in phonology and morphology. Further information can be found in the article Ukrainian dialects.\n\nThe following points of Ukrainian phonology need to be considered in order to properly understand the grammar of Ukrainian.\n\nTwo different classifications of vowels can be made: a historical perspective and a modern perspective. From a historical perspective, the Ukrainian vowels can be divided into two categories:\nFrom a modern perspective, the Ukrainian vowels can be divided into two categories:\n\nIn Ukrainian, consonants can be categorised as follows:\n\nIn the Ukrainian language, the following sound changes have occurred between the Common Slavic period and current Ukrainian:\n\n\n\nThe following assimilations occur:\n\nThe most common dissimilation is encountered in the infinitive of verbs, where {д, т} + т dissimilates to ст, for example, крад + ти gives красти and плет + ти gives плести.\n\nThe nominal declension has seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative), in two numbers (singular and plural), and absolutely obeying grammatical gender (masculine, feminine and neuter). Adjectives, pronouns, and the first two cardinal numbers have gender specific forms.\n\nA third number, the dual, also existed in Old East Slavic, but except for its use in the nominative and accusative cases with the numbers two, three and four, e.g. dvi hryvni/дві гривні vs. dvoje hryven' /двоє гривень (recategorised today as a nominative plural), it has been lost. Other traces of the dual can be found when referring to objects of which are commonly in pairs: eyes, shoulders, ears, \"e.g.\" \"plečyma\". Occasionally, dual forms can distinguish between meanings.\n\nIn Ukrainian, there are 4 declension types. The first declension is used for most feminine nouns. The second declension is used for most masculine and neuter nouns. The third declension is used for feminine nouns ending in ь or a post-alveolar sibilant. The fourth declension is used for neuter nouns ending in я/а (Common Slavic \"*ę\").\n\nMost of the types consist of 3 different subgroups: hard, mixed, and soft. The soft subgroup consists of nouns whose roots end in a soft letter (followed by iotified vowel or soft vowel). The mixed subgroup consists of the nouns whose roots end in a post-alveolar sibilant or occasionally \"r\". The hard group consists of all other nouns.\n\nIf the hard group endings are taken as the basis, then the following rules can be used to derive the corresponding mixed and soft endings:\n\nNouns ending in a consonant are marked in the following tables with ∅ (no ending).\n\nThis declension consists of nouns that end in а or я. It consists primarily of feminine nouns, but a few nouns with these ending referring to professions can be either masculine or feminine. In these cases, the genitive plural is often formed by adding -ів. Nouns referring to people can also take this ending.\n\nThe second declension consists of masculine and neuter nouns.\n\nMasculine nouns: This group consists primarily of nouns ending in a consonant, a soft sign ь, or й. In this declension, nouns ending in р can belong to any of the three declension subgroups: hard, mixed, and soft. There is no way of knowing from the nominative form, to which group the noun belongs.\nNotes:\n\nNeuter nouns:\nThis category consists of neuter nouns ending in о, е, and substantives ending in я, preceded by either a double consonant, apostrophe, or two consonants, which primarily are derived from verbs. This last category once did end in \"*ĭjе\", but due to the sound change given above developed an я ending.\n\n\nThis declension consists solely of feminine nouns that end in a consonant. This declension has only 2 subgroups: a mixed and soft group.\n\n\nThis declension consists of solely neuter nouns that are derived from Common Slavic \"*ę\". There are two subgroups: those with an н insert, and those with a т insert.\n\nUkrainian adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case.\n\nIn Ukrainian, there exist a small number of adjectives, primarily possessives, which exist in the masculine in the so-called \"short\" form. This \"short\" form is a relic of the indefinite declension of adjectives in Common Slavic. Common examples of this anomalous declension are \"бабин\" (masculine) compared to \"бабина\" (feminine); \"братів\" (masculine) compared to \"братова\" (feminine); and \"повинен\" (masculine) compared to \"повинна\". This \"short\" form only exists in the masculine nominative form. All other forms are regular.\n\nIn Ukrainian, there are 2 different declension types: hard and soft. The soft type can be further subdivided into two types. Unlike for the nouns, the post-alveolar sibilants are counted as hard. There also exists a special mixed declension for adjectives ending in -лиций. These adjectives are derived from the noun лице, describing types of faces, for example, білолиций.\n\nNote about the declensions:\n\n\nIn Ukrainian adjectives also have a comparative and superlative forms.\n\nThe comparative form is created by dropping \"ий\" and adding the ending \"-(і)ший\". The resulting form is declined like a regular hard stem adjective. As usual, some adjectives have irregular forms.\n\nThe superlative form is created by prefixing \"най-\" to the comparative form. Words associated with religion often prefix \"пре-\" (very) to the comparative form. As usual, some adjectives have irregular forms.\n\nIn Ukrainian, adverbs are formed by taking the stem of the adjective (that is dropping the \"−а\" from the feminine nominative singular form; forms ending in −я are replaced by \"−ьа\" (after consonants) or \"−йа\" (after vowels), before dropping the \"−а\".) and adding the ending\n\nFor example, \"гарний\" gives \"гарно\". The comparative and superlative forms of an adverb are formed by taking the corresponding form of the adjective and replacing \"−ий\" by \"-е\", for example, \"гарніше\" from \"гарніший\".\n\nAdverbs can also be derived from the locative or instrumental singular of a noun, for example, \"ввечері\" (from в plus the locative of вечера), \"нагорі\" (from на plus the locative of гора).\n\nThe personal pronouns are declined as follows.\n\nThe demonstrative pronoun, той, is declined as follows.\n\nThe first (мій) and second person (твій) singular possessive pronouns are declined similarly as can be seen from the table below.\n\nThe first (наш) and second (ваш) person plural possessive pronouns are declined as below. The masculine nominative forms are the \"short\" forms.\n\nThe third person plural possessive pronoun, їхній, is declined as a normal soft adjective.\n\nThe interrogative pronouns, хто and що, are declined as follows.\n\nThe interrogative pronoun, чий, is declined as given in the table below.\n\nComments:\n\nIn general, the following rules are used to determine agreement between the cardinal number and a noun. In the nominative case, the nouns agree with the last number in any compound number. Nouns that must agree with a number ending in 2, 3, or 4 are in the nominative plural, but retain the stress of the dual, that is the genitive singular. Nouns, which must agree with a number ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and all the teens are in the genitive plural. In any other case, the nouns and numbers are in the same case.\n\nGrammatical conjugation is subject to three persons in two numbers and three simple tenses (present/future, future, and past), with periphrastic forms for the future and Conditional, as well as imperative forms and present/past participles, distinguished by adjectival and adverbial usage. There are two voices, active and middle/passive, which is constructed by the addition of a reflexive suffix -ся/сь to the active form. An interesting feature is that the past tense is actually made to agree in gender with the subject, for it is the participle in an originally periphrastic perfect formed with the present of быть (modern: бути) ,\"to be.\" Verbal inflection today is considerably simpler than in Common Slavic. The ancient aorist, imperfect, and (periphrastic) pluperfect have been lost. The loss of three of the former six tenses has been offset by the reliance, as in other Slavic languages, on verbal aspect. Most verbs come in pairs, one with imperfective or continuous connotation, the other with perfective or completed, usually formed with a (prepositional) prefix, but occasionally using a different root.\n\nThe present tense of the verb бути, \"to be\", today normally has the form, \"є\" used for all persons and numbers. Previously (before 1500) and occasionally in liturgical settings, aspects of the full conjugation, can be found. The paradigm shows as well as anything else the Indo-European affinity of Ukrainian:\n\nNote: Ukrainian forms followed by * are considered archaic in Standard Ukrainian (albeit those are still used in dialects) and are replaced by є. In the present tense, the verb бути is often omitted (or replaced by a dash \"—\" in writing), for example, Я — студент.\n\nThere exist two different classification of verbs: traditional and historical/linguistic.\n\nThe traditional classification of verbs subdivides the verbs into two categories based on the form of the 3rd person singular present indicative form of the verb.\n\nThe historical/linguistic classification of verbs subdivides the verbs into 5 categories. Classes 1,2 and 3 correspond to the \"е\" stems of the traditional classification, while class 4 corresponds to the \"и\" stems. Class 5 consists of the athematic verbs.\n\n\nUkrainian had 2 voices: (1) active voice and (2) passive voice. The active voice is the only voice with a complete set of conjugations. The active voice, in general, shows a direct effect of the verb on its subject.\n\nThe indicative mood is used to describe events, which have occurred, are occurring, or will occur. In Ukrainian, the indicative mood contains the present, future, and past tenses.\n\nHistorically, this is derived from the Indo-European present tense. In Common Slavic and later Ukrainian, it retained its present meaning only for imperfective verbs and developed a future meaning for perfective verbs.\n\nFor the \"е\" stems (Classes 1, 2, and 3), the endings are:\n\nAll verbs whose roots end in a velar undergo the first palatalisation in all forms of the present (even though historically speaking the first person singular should not). The endings in \"є\" are used for roots whose stem ends in a vowel. All verbs in Class 3 and those that end in a vowel use \"-ю\" and \"-ють\". Furthermore, Class 3 verbs undergo iotification in those forms that use \"-ю-\". For reflexive verbs, in the third person singular, the ending has its historical \"-ть\" restored before the participle \"-ся / -сь\" is affixed. Thus, the ending becomes \"-еться\".\n\nFor the \"и\" stems (Class 4), the endings are:\n\nAll Class 4 verbs undergo iotification in the first person singular. Thus, there is really only one ending, which due to orthographic reasons is given 2 different forms. Verbs ending in a vowel take the endings in the second column. In the third person plural, verbs ending in a labial insert an \"л\" before the ending, \"-ять\". The ending \"-ать\" is used after the sibilants \"ж, ш, щ\", or \"ч\".\n\nUkrainian inherited from Indo-European through Common Slavic, the following 3 athematic verbs. These verbs have their own conjugation in the present. Everywhere else they are regular.\n\nThe past tense in Ukrainian has the peculiarity of being originally an adjective, since it derives from the original compound perfect (corresponding to, for example, the Latin first conjugation participle ending \"-atus\"). Thus, the past tense agrees in number and gender with the subject of the verb. The following endings are added to the infinitive with the ending \"-ти\" removed (Most root final \"д\" and \"т\" are dropped):\n\n\nClass 2 verbs can have forms without the −ну, for example, \"заслабнути\" has the forms \"заслаб\", \"заслабла\", \"заслабло\", and \"заслабли\". Not all Class 2 verbs undergo this change.\n\nThese forms are often called the active past participle I. The masculine singular evolved from an earlier *-лъ that delingualized (cf. Polish \"-ł\").\n\nIn Ukrainian, there are 2 different future tenses for imperfective verbs. The first form, called \"simple\" (\"проста форма\"), formed by adding to the infinitive of the verb the following endings, which are derived from the Common Slavic verb \"*jęti\" (Present stem: jĭm−):\n\nThe second form, called \"compound\" (\"складена форма\"), is to take the present tense conjugation of the verb \"бути\" and use it with the infinitive of the verb. Thus,\n\nThis will translate as \"will eat\" with the appropriate personal pronoun.\n\nThe imperative mood is used to give commands. It exists in only the present tense in Ukrainian. There are no forms for the 1st person singular. \nIn Ukrainian, the imperative mood is formed from the present stem of the verb plus the following endings (The example is based on Ukrainian \"пити\"):\n\nThe first set of endings is to be used for stems that end in a dentals (\"з, д, т, с, н,\" and \"л\"). The second set of ending is used for stems that end in a vowel. The third set of endings is used for stems that end in labials or post-alveolar sibilants (\"б, в, м, п, ф, ш, щ, ч, ж,\" and \"р\"). The fourth set of endings is used with verbs whose unaffixed form (no prefixes or suffixes) have the stress on the ending in the first person singular of the present tense. As well, most Class 2 verbs and those verb roots ending in a consonant plus \"л\" or \"р\" take these endings. Thus for example, \"бери\" and \"вибери\". Class 5 verbs take the first set of endings, but undergo an archaic form of iotation, so that \"дь\" becomes \"ж\" (rather than \"дж\"), for example, \"їжте\" < \"їд+ьте\". This does not apply to \"дати\", which is treated as a regular verb with a stem in \"да-\".\n\nFinally note that all verbs with stems that end in \"к\" and \"г\" undergo the first palatalisation. Class 3 verbs with stems in \"к\", \"г\", and \"с\" undergo iotification (as do their present conjugation).\n\nThe conditional mood is used to state hypothetical states, wishes, and desires. It has 2 tenses in Ukrainian: a present and a past.\n\nThe present conditional is formed in Ukrainian from the participle \"би\" or the short form \"б\", which is derived from the archaic aorist conjugation of the verb, \"бути\", and the active past participle I, which is the same as the past indicative participle. Thus, there is agreement between the subject and the participle. An example of this construction would be \"я би хотів ...\" (I would like...).\n\nThe past conditional is formed in Ukrainian from the participle \"би\" or the short form \"б\" followed by the active past participle I form of the verb \"бути\" (\"був, була, було, були\") and then the active past participle I of the verb. Both participles must agree with the subject. An example of this construction would be \"як я би був знав...\" (had I (had) known...). Alternatively, the past conditional can be formed by using the form \"якби\" and the active past participle I form of the verb, for example, \"якби я знав…\".\n\nThe passive voice has 2 different functions. It shows either that the subject has had something done to itself or that something indeterminate has occurred to the subject.\nIn Ukrainian, the passive voice is formed as follows:\n\nIn Ukrainian, there exist traces of all five Common Slavic participles.\n\nThis participle is formed by taking the third person plural form, dropping the \"ть\", and adding \"чи(й)\". Most commonly this participle is used as gerund with the form \"чи\" with a meaning approaching the equivalent English construction with \"-ing\". Occasionally, it is used as an adjective. In this case its form is \"чий\". Examples of this participle are \"несучи\", \"знаючи\", and \"хвалячи\".\n\nThis participle does not exist in Ukrainian as a separate form. However, it is commonly encountered as an adjective in \"-мий\". Common examples of this participle are \"відомий\" and \"знайомий\".\n\nThis participle is encountered in forming the past tense in Ukrainian. Occasionally, it is found as an adjective for intransitive verbs. It is formed by taking the infinitive stem and adding the ending \"-в, -ла, -ло,\" and \"-ли\" to form the past tense participle (in reality the indefinite form of the adjective) and the ending \"-лий\" to form the regular adjective. An example of the adjectival form is \"почорнілий\".\n\nThis participle is most commonly encountered as a gerund, while it is only used occasionally as an adjective. It is formed by taking the masculine past participle I and adding the ending \"-ши(й)\". An example of the gerund is \"знавши\", while a common (dialectical) adjective would be the word \"бувший\".\n\nThe past passive participle is the only participle used commonly as an adjective. There are two parallel forms with no difference in meaning: in \"-тий\" or in \"-ний\". This participle is formed from the infinitive stem for most verbs. Class 2 verbs can as for other participles drop the suffix \"ну\" or only the \"у\", for example, движений from двигнути. Verbs in \"-ува́ти\" or \"-юва́ти\" (those whose ending is stressed) will replace the \"у\" by \"о\" and \"ю\" by \"ь/йо\" (\"ь\" if a consonant precedes or \"й\" if a vowel), for example, мальо́ваний from малюва́ти. Finally, Class 3 stems with full voicing have two possible stems: the first is simply obtained by dropping the −ти from the infinitive, while the second is obtained by dropping the last three letters (which in effect means using the present form). The first form will take the −тий ending, while the second form will take the −ний ending, for example полоти has полотий and полений. Note that the verb молоти has the second form мелений, since it derives from *melti in Common Slavonic). The ending is determined as follows:\n\nThe verbal noun is created by taking the past passive participle, dropping \"ий\", doubling the consonant if permitted by the rules under \"-ĭjV\", and adding a \"я\". This will be a neuter noun declined like all neuter nouns in \"*ĭjе\". It should be noted that if the \"-е-\" of the past passive participle is stressed then the \"е\" will mutate into an \"і\". Examples include \"питання\" from \"питати\" and \"носіння\" from \"носити\". Note that any Class 3 verbs in -увати or -ювати will restore the \"у\" or \"ю\" малювання from мальований (малювати)\n\nThe verbal noun in Ukrainian is derived from the Common Slavic verbal noun, where it was formed by adding \"*-ĭjе\" to the past passive participle without the \"*ŭ\" ending. Thus, in Ukrainian, the consonant is doubled if possible.\n\nUkrainian has a rich set of prefixes, both prepositional and adverbial in nature, as well as diminutive, augmentative, and frequentative suffixes. All of these can be stacked one upon the other, to produce multiple derivatives of a given word. Participles and other inflexional forms may also have a special connotation. For example, the word напіввідкритий can be split into the following prefixes and suffixes:\nна + пів + від + кри (root) + тий. \n\nIn Ukrainian, prefixes can be added to a root and stacked on top of each as in the above example. The most common prefixes are given in the table below. Although the prefixes have the given meaning, when attached to a root, it is possible that the resulting new word will have a unique meaning that is distantly related to the original meaning of the prefix. If possible the example is given using the verbal root ходити or the nominal root хід.\n\n(1) The multitude of forms in Ukrainian for the Common Slavic *sŭ(n) (*съ(н)) is a result of the fact that the initial \"s\" could assimilate (or dissimilate) with the root's initial consonants. As well, since a \"ь\" followed there was the potential for further sound changes. Finally, words entered Ukrainian from different Slavic languages with their own peculiarities or that the original origin of the word was lost. The following are examples of all the given possibilities:\n\nIn Ukrainian, the normal form is \"з\" except before к, п, т, ф and х where the normal form is \"с\".\n\nThe following rules are followed when adding a prefix to the root:\n\nIn Ukrainian, suffixes can be added to a root and stacked on top of each to produce a family of words. The most common suffixes are given in the table below. The curly brackets {} denote the various possible different suffixes with a similar meaning\n\nTwo or more adjectives can be combined into a single word using an о as the linking vowel, for example, сільськогосподарський, which consists of the adjectives сільський and господарський. If the second adjective starts with a vowel, then a dash can be used to separate the linking vowel and the second adjective, for example, середньо-європеський.\n\nIn addition to the suffixes and prefixes that can be added to verbs, Ukrainian verbs have inherited occasional traces of the Indo-European ablaut. The primary ablaut is the difference between long and short Indo-European vowels. In Ukrainian, due to the fact that the long and short vowels experienced different reflexes, this ablaut is reflected as a change in vowels. The resulting verbs are often imperfect-perfect pairs. For example, we have скочити and скакати (simplified Indo-European *skoki- and *skōka-).\n\nThe common Ukrainian coordinations are:\n\nCommon Ukrainian subordinations are:\n\n\nThe basic word order, both in conversation and the written language, is subject–verb–object. However, because the relations are marked by inflexion, considerable latitude in word order is allowed, and all the permutations can be used. The word order expresses the logical stress, and the degree of definiteness.\n\nUnlike English, Latin, and various other languages, Ukrainian allows multiple negatives, as in “nixto nikoly nikomu ničoho ne proščaje” (‘no-one ever forgives anyone anything’, literally ‘no-one never to no-one nothing does not forgive’). Single negatives are often grammatically incorrect because when negation is used in complex sentences every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative.\n\nObjects of a negated verb are placed in the genitive case, where they would be accusative if the verb were not negated.\n\nThe use of cases in Ukrainian can be very complicated. In general, the nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative cases can be used without a preposition. On the other hand, the locative and instrumental cases are used primarily with a preposition. Furthermore, and much like in Latin, different prepositions can be followed by nouns in different cases, resulting in different meanings.\n\nUkrainian verbs can have one of two aspects: imperfective and perfective. The imperfective form denotes an action that is taking place in the present, is ongoing, is repetitive, or is habitual. The perfective form indicates an action that is completed, is the result of an action, is the beginning of an action, or is shorter or longer than usual. For example, \"spaty\" (спати) is imperfective, while \"pospaty\" (поспати) is perfective.\n\n\nNote: All Common Slavic words quoted are translated faithfully by their Ukrainian forms.\nAbbreviations used: \n\n\n"}
