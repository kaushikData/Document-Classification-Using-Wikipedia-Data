Achomi is close to standard new Persian in most aspects and is a dialect of Persian with a grammar distinct from Persian. The language is mainly spoken by the Achomi people, but also by some Huwala. The majority of Achomi people are Sunni Muslims.\n\nIranian people who have migrated from southern Iran to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf at the early 20th century still speak this language in their homes, however, this variety has been somewhat influenced by the Arabic language.\n\nSpeakers of Achomi dialects in Iran that come from different towns might also find some variations in some words and may differ slightly in grammar and particularly in accent. Hence, if the speaker is from Evaz, they are referred as speaking Evazi, and if they are from Bastak their dialect is known as Bastaki.\n\nSince the Achomi region is widespread, there are different Achomi accents and some slight differences in grammar. For example, in some places people say \"raftom\" for \"I went\" (very similar to the Persian \"raftam\"), but in some other places like Lar people say \"chedem\" instead (Kurdish: \"dichim\" or \"dechim)\".\n\nTo create a passive verb in past tense we can use the verb root plus its proper prefix. For example, in Achomi (Lari), the root for the verb \"to tell\" is \"got\" (\"gota\" equals \"tell\").\n\nomgot (om+got), Kurdish (migot or min got) = I told ...\n\notgot (om+got), Kurdish (tugot or tegot) = You told...\n\noshgot (osh+got), Kurdish (wigot) = He told...\n\nmogot (mo+got), Kurdish (megot) = We told...\n\ntogot (to+got), Kurdish pl (wegot) = You(pl) told\n\nshogot (sho+got), Kurdish (wa-n got) = They told\n\nAnother example: \"deda\" means \"see,\" and \"dee\" Kurdish (Deed or dee) is the root verb. So:\n\nomdee = I saw, Kurdish (mideed, midee, min deed, min dee) \n\notdee= you saw, Kurdish (tu-te dee)...\n\nTo create a simple present or continued present tense of a passive verb, here's another example:\n\nagota'em (a+got+aem):I am telling...\n\nagota'esh (a+got+aesh): You are telling...\n\nagotay (a+got+ay): He is telling...\n\nagota'am (a+got+a'am): We are telling...\n\nagotay (a+got+ay): You(pl) are telling...\n\nagota'en (a+got+a'en): They are telling...\n\nFor the verb \"see\" (\"deda\"):\n\nadead'em, adeda'esh, adeaday...\n"}

{"id": "21478754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21478754", "title": "Common sense", "text": "Common sense\n\nCommon sense is sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters, or a basic ability to perceive, understand, and judge that is shared by (\"common to\") nearly all people. The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as \"the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done.\" The second type is sometimes described as folk wisdom, \"signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought.\" The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.\n\nIn a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as \"the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language\" and notes, \"A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false.\"\n\nThe everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin ', Greek ('), and French , but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: \"good sense\" is sometimes seen as equivalent to \"common sense\", and sometimes not.\n\n\"Common sense\" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul (, ) proposed by Aristotle, which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.\n\nThe second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community. Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.\n\nAll these meanings of \"common sense\", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern Western civilisation, notably concerning science, politics and economics. The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.\n\nSince the Age of Enlightenment the term \"common sense\" has frequently been used for rhetorical effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, as an authority. It can be negatively equated to vulgar prejudice and superstition, or on the contrary it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for good taste and as the source of the most basic axioms needed for science and logic. It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: \"Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to accept precisely because they accorded so well with the basic (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body\" \nThis began with Descartes' criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between \"rationalism\" and \"empiricism\". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, \"Discourse on Method\", Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense (), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon. In the ensuing 18th century Enlightenment, common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to metaphysics, which was, like Cartesianism, associated with the . Thomas Paine's polemical pamphlet \"Common Sense\" (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the American and French revolutions. Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in epistemology and ethics, with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern social sciences.\n\nThe origin of the term is in the works of Aristotle. The best-known case is \"De Anima\" Book III, chapter 1, especially at line 425a27. The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the five specialized sense perceptions, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of \"perceptible\" or \"sensible\" which is specific (, ) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the \"common sensibles\" (or \"common perceptibles\"). In this discussion, \"common\" (, ) is a term opposed to specific or particular (). The Greek for these common sensibles is (, ), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing. Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.\n\nIn this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these (such as movement) we already have a sense, a \"common sense\" or sense of the common things (), which does not work by accident (, ). And there is no specific () sense perception for movement and other , because then we would not perceive the at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. explains that \"when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured\". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident. Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have \"some one thing\" that can distinguish black from sweet. The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; , , ) of what the specialist senses have perceived. The common sense is therefore also where a type of consciousness originates, \"for it makes us aware of having sensations at all\". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.\n\nThe discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher Plato in his Socratic dialogue, the \"Theaetetus\". But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing is an active thinking process in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this , which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.\nThe passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details. has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the imaginative faculty (, ), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same. Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and Al-Farabi felt they were distinct, but later, Avicenna emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers. argues that Aristotle used the term \"common sense\" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls \"the perceptual capacity of the soul\", or the higher level \"sensory capacity of the soul\" that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there appears to have been a standardization of the term as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.\n\nCompared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul () has an extra level of complexity in the form of the or \"intellect\"—which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using reasoning (, ) as well as the \"active intellect\". The identifies the true forms of things, while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's \"common sense\" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. Reason or rationality () exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive \"common perceptibles\" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and . Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions. Gregorić additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs and to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason. Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the used for perception and imagination in animals, and the or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or .\n\nAristotle also occasionally called the (or one version of it) the (, ). (According to Gregorić, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as Themistius, Galen, and Al-Farabi, called it the of the senses or sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's \"Timaeus\" (70b). Augustine and some of the Arab writers, also called it the \"inner sense\". The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the Middle Ages. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers Al-Farabi and Avicenna, several inner senses came to be listed. \"Thomas Aquinas and John of Jandun recognized four internal senses: the common sense, imagination, , and memory. Avicenna, followed by Robert Grosseteste, Albert the Great, and Roger Bacon, argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, , and memory.\" By the time of Descartes and Hobbes, in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to \"five wits\", which complemented the more well-known five \"external\" senses. Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior Galenic ventricle of the brain. The great anatomist Andreas Vesalius however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.\n\n\"\" is the Latin translation of the Greek , which came to be recovered by Medieval scholastics when discussing Aristotelian theories of perception. However, in earlier Latin during the Roman empire the term had taken a distinct ethical detour, developing new shades of meaning. These especially Roman meanings were apparently influenced by several Stoic Greek terms with the word (, ); not only , but also such terms as (, ) (), and , all of which involve —something, at least in Aristotle, that would not be present in \"lower\" animals.\n\nAnother link between Latin and Aristotle's Greek was in rhetoric, a subject that Aristotle was the first to systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of opinions (, ) that are widely held. Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as (, ), which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as ().\n\nIn his \"Rhetoric\" for example Aristotle mentions \"\" or \"common beliefs\", saying that \"our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, [...] when speaking of converse with the multitude\". In a similar passage in his own work on rhetoric, \"De Oratore\", Cicero wrote that \"in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life and the usage approved by the sense of the community\". The sense of the community is in this case one translation of \"\" in the Latin of Cicero.\n\nWhether the Latin writers such as Cicero deliberately used this Aristotelian term in a new more peculiarly Roman way, probably also influenced by Greek Stoicism, therefore remains a subject of discussion. has proposed for example that the Roman republic maintained a very \"oral\" culture whereas in Aristotle's time rhetoric had come under heavy criticism from philosophers such as Socrates. argues, in agreement with Shaftesbury in the 18th century, that the concept developed from the Stoic concept of ethical virtue, influenced by Aristotle, but emphasizing the role of both the individual perception, and shared communal understanding. But in any case a complex of ideas attached itself to the term, to be almost forgotten in the Middle Ages, and eventually returning into ethical discussion in 18th-century Europe, after Descartes.\n\nAs with other meanings of common sense, for the Romans of the classical era \"it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection\". But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's \"Timaeus\" (concerning a primordial \"sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature\"), he and other Roman authors did not normally use it as a technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in \"De Anima\", and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages. Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of . This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only human nature, but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on. Apart from Cicero, Quintilian, Lucretius, Seneca, Horace and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term \"\" in a range of such ways. As C. S. Lewis wrote:\nCompared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman authors were not so strict about the boundary between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible , and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of , the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not just in terms of memories of sense perceptions, but in terms of the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.\n\nOne of the last notable philosophers to accept something like the Aristotelian \"common sense\" was Descartes in the 17th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his \"Meditations on first philosophy\". The common sense is the link between the body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the pineal gland. Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct way. To get a more distinct understanding of things, it is more important to be methodical and mathematical. This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.\nContemporaries such as Gassendi and Hobbes went beyond Descartes in some ways in their rejection of Aristotelianism, rejecting explanations involving anything other than matter and motion, including the distinction between the animal-like judgement of sense perception, a special separate common sense, and the human mind or , which Descartes had retained from Aristotelianism. In contrast to Descartes who \"found it unacceptable to assume that sensory representations may enter the mental realm from without\"...\nBut Descartes used two different terms in his work, not only the Latin term \"\", but also the French term , with which he opens his \"Discourse on Method\". And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. is the equivalent of modern English \"common sense\" or \"good sense\". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of gave a new way of defining in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate as , but treated them as two separate things).\n\nThe idea that now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of skeptical reasoning. The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, Spinoza, and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing Bourbon, and Habsburg dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to Machiavellianism and Protestantism as part of the so-called counter reformation.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the linking them). Cartesians such as Henricus Regius, Geraud de Cordemoy, and Nicolas Malebranche realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the \"external world\" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith. Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a \"revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense\". Descartes and the Cartesian \"rationalists\", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and inductive reasoning, and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or \"\" knowledge in the human mind—a controversial proposal.\n\nIn contrast to the rationalists, the \"empiricists\" took their orientation from Francis Bacon, whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the \"idols of the mind\", presented in his \"Novum Organum\", and in his \"Essays\" described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies. But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience, experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced Locke and Pierre Bayle, in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 Voltaire \"introduced him as the \"father\" of the scientific method\" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to \"common sense\" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the .\n\nAs mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, John Locke abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of \"common sensibles\" that are perceived. But then George Berkeley abandoned both. David Hume agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of extreme skepticism. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:\n\nOnce Thomas Hobbes and Spinoza had applied Cartesian approaches to political philosophy, concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, Shaftesbury and, much less known at the time, Giambattista Vico, both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after Hans-Georg Gadamer, as a humanist interpretation of the term. Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals (methodological individualism), ignoring the \"sense of community\" that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering \"common good sense\" as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.\n\nShaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay \"Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour\" was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of \"Good Breeding\". He drew upon authors such as Seneca, Juvenal, Horace and Marcus Aurelius, for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as Francis Hutcheson was what came to be called \"moral sentiment\", which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:\nHutcheson described it as, \"a Publick Sense, viz. \"our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery.\"\" which, he explains, \"was sometimes called or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients\".\n\nA reaction to Shaftesbury in defense of the Hobbesian approach of treating communities as driven by individual self-interest, was not long coming in Bernard Mandeville's controversial works. Indeed, this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.\n\nBy the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the \"moral sense\" or \"moral sentiment\" referred to by Hume and Adam Smith, the latter writing in plural of the \"moral sentiments\" with the key one being \"sympathy\", which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. Jeremy Bentham gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:\n\nAccording to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or ), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day. But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. \" was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness (conscience) and taste.\" The concept of \"was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment\". But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.\n\nGadamer notes one less-known exception—the Württemberg pietism, inspired by the 18th century Swabian churchman, M. Friedrich Christoph Oetinger, who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of Leibniz and Wolff, who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.\n\nVico, who taught classical rhetoric in Naples (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon Hans-Georg Gadamer, Benedetto Croce and Antonio Gramsci. Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term . Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his \"On the Study Methods of our Time\", which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to \"break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached\", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make enthymemes. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities—as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as syllogisms, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a \"guiding standard of eloquence\" but also \"the standard of practical judgment\". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the , is built up under this training, becoming the \"fund\" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.\n\nIn its mature version, Vico's conception of is defined by him as \"judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race\". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by Plato, Tacitus, Francis Bacon and Grotius. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss Natural Law, improving upon Grotius, John Selden, and Pufendorf who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them. This is comparable to both Montesquieu's \"Spirit of the Laws\", as well as much later Hegelian historicism, both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.\n\nContemporary with Hume, but critical of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:\nThomas Reid was a successor to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow. While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.\n\nReid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and J. S. Mill, who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.\n\nDespite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American pragmatism, and modern Thomism. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a for any possibility of rational discussion between people.\n\nImmanuel Kant developed a new variant of the idea of , noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of aesthetics and taste:\n\nKant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: \"the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition\".\n\nBut Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's \"\", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his \"Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics\" as using \"the magic wand of common sense\", and not properly confronting the \"metaphysical\" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically—the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.\n\nKant used different words to refer to his aesthetic , for which he used Latin or else German , and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as , , or .\n\nAccording to Gadamer, in contrast to the \"wealth of meaning\" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant \"developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of \"moral feeling\" that had been worked out in English philosophy\". The moral imperative \"cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility\". For Kant, the only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge. Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from \"the free play of all our cognitive powers\", and is communal only in that it \"abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion\".\n\nKant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:\n\nContinuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced C. S. Peirce, the founder of the philosophical movement now known as Pragmatism, which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was \"Critical Common-Sensism\". Peirce, who wrote after Charles Darwin, suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.\n\nAnother example still influential today is from G. E. Moore, several of whose essays, such as the 1925 \"A Defence of Common Sense\", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. Michael Huemer has advocated an epistemic theory he calls \"phenomenal conservatism\", which he claims to accord with common sense by way of internalist intuition.\n\nIn twentieth century philosophy the concept of the as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of relativism are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as Jacques Rancière indeed take the lead from Jean-François Lyotard and refer to the \"postmodern\" condition as one where there is \"\".\n\nHannah Arendt adapted Kant's concept of as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a \"Kantian\" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like Adolf Eichmann, which consisted in a lack of and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also Jürgen Habermas, who took a similar position concerning Kant's , were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a \"euphony\" in \"dis-sensus\". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.\n\nIn a parallel development, Antonio Gramsci, Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, \"Truth and Method\", can be read as an \"extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry\". In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.\n\nGadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called . Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment \"prejudice against prejudice\" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the \"Afterword\" of \"Truth and Method\", \"I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue\".\n\nPaul Ricoeur argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a \"basic kind of knowing on which others rest.\" But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.\n\nA recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it \"privatized\" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a Socratic dialectic aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers Richard J. Bernstein, Bernard Williams, Richard Rorty, and Alasdair MacIntyre, and the recent theorist of rhetoric, Richard Lanham.\n\nThe other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially economics. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of self-interested individuals is a central assumption in much of modern mathematical economics, and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.\n\nWhile the term \"common sense\" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about methodological individualism as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by Milton Friedman and more recently by Gary S. Becker, both members of the so-called Chicago school of economics). As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as Deirdre McCloskey, who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian Richard Rorty and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.\n\nAmong Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian François Fénelon and philosopher Claude Buffier (1661–1737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example Jean-Marie de Lamennais. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on Théodore Jouffroy. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. Matteo Liberatore, seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the of Aristotle, that correspond to the of Aquinas. In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with Étienne Gilson and Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:\n\nGilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that \"as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It uses half-inch metal particle tape at 83.88 mm/s (compare to D-2's 19 mm and 131.7 mm/s). Like D-2, the composite video signal is sampled at four times the color subcarrier frequency, with eight bits per sample. Four channels of 48 kHz 16–20 bit PCM audio, and other ancillary data, are inserted during the vertical blanking interval. The aggregate net (error corrected) bitrate of the format is 143 Mbit/s, and because the codec is lossless, it has been used in data applications. Camcorders were available which used this format, and are to date the only digital tape camcorders to use a lossless encoding scheme. The D-5 format, introduced in 1993 by Panasonic and marketed as D-5 HD, uses the D-3 transport and tape running at roughly double D-3 speed. The D-3 transport in turn is derived from the MII transport. D-3/D-5 tapes come in small (161 mm × 96 mm × 25 mm), medium (212 mm × 124 mm × 25 mm), and large (296 mm × 167 mm × 25 mm) cassettes, with format-specific recognition holes.

In the 1990s the BBC embarked on a massive project to copy its older video tapes onto D-3, but the D-3 cassettes themselves have become unstable and are being transferred again, although there is doubt over whether the surviving D-3 machines will last long enough to play the 340,000 tapes which the corporation holds.\n\n"}

{"id": "4742322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4742322", "title": "Dominican Spanish", "text": "Dominican Spanish\n\nDominican Spanish is Spanish as spoken in the Dominican Republic; and also among the Dominican diaspora, most of whom live in the United States, chiefly in New York City, New Jersey, Boston, and Miami.\n\nDominican Spanish, a subset of Caribbean Spanish, is based on the Andalusian and Canarian Spanish dialects of southern Spain, and has borrowed vocabulary from Taíno and other Arawakan languages, from West African languages, and from English. Speakers of Dominican Spanish may also use conservative words that in the upper-class speech of Spain would be considered archaisms. The variety spoken in the Cibao region is a mixture of two dialects: that of the 16th- and 17th-century Portuguese colonists in the Cibao valley, and that of the 18th-century Canarian settlers. According to the linguist John Lipski, the greatest extra-Hispanic influences on Dominican Spanish have been Haitian Creole and West African languages.\n\nMost of the Spanish-speaking settlers came from Andalusia (southern Spain) and the Canary Islands. When they first arrived in what is now the Dominican Republic, the first native people they had contact with were the Arawak-speaking Taino people.\n\nSpanish, just as in other Latin American countries, completely replaced the indigenous languages (Taíno and the language of the Ciguayos) of the Dominican Republic to the point where they became entirely extinct, mainly due to the fact that the majority of the indigenous population quickly died out only a few years after European contact.\n\nHowever, when the Spanish arrived, they found the flora and fauna of the island, as well as various cultural artifacts, very different from those of Spain, so many of the words used by the natives to name these things were conserved and assimilated, thereby enriching Spanish lexicon. Some of these words include: \"ají, anón, batata, barbacoa, bejuco, bija, caiman, canoa, caoba, conuco, guanábana, guayaba, hamaca, hobo (jobo), jagua, maní, papaya (lechosa), sabana, yuca.\"\n\nThe Dominican Spanish lexicon also includes words borrowed from African languages spoken by the Africans brought to the island after the Taíno extinction, such as \"cachimbo\", which was borrowed from the Portuguese word \"cacimba\", having the latter being borrowed from the Bantu \"cazimba\".\n\n\nOther differences with Standard Spanish include subtleties like hypercorrection, in particular, adding the \"s\" erroneously, thus overcompensating the habit of omitting it.\n\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\n\nThe hypercorrected form is more of a blatantly sarcastic mode of speech, commonly used for joking rather than everyday speech.\n\nAs in every dialect, Dominican Spanish has numerous vocabulary differences from other forms of the language. The Dominican Academy of Letters (Academia Dominicana de la Lengua) published in November 2013 a dictionary of Dominican terms (\"Diccionario del español dominicano\") containing close to 11,000 words and phrases peculiar to the Dominican dialect. Here are some examples:\n\nA slightly pejorative slang expression also common around most of the Caribbean basin is \"vaina\". The Castilian meanings are \"sheath\", \"pod\", \"shell\", \"shell casing\", and \"hull\" (of a plant). It is descended from the Latin word \"vāgīna\", which meant \"sheath\". \nIn the Dominican Republic \"vaina\" is mainly a thing, a matter, or simply \"stuff\". For example, \"¿Qué vaina es esa?\" means \"¿Qué cosa es esa?\", \"What is that thing/stuff?\".\n\nAnglicisms—due to cultural and commercial influence from the United States and the American occupations of the Dominican Republic during 1916–1924 and 1965–1966—are extremely common in Dominican Spanish, more so than in any other Spanish variant except for Puerto Rican and perhaps Northern Mexican Spanish. A prime example of this is \"\"vaguada\", which is a corruption of the English \"bad weather\", though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean storm or torrential downpour, rather than a spot of unpleasant climate. Hence, a common Dominican expression: \"Viene una vaguada\"\", \"here comes a \"vaguada\"\", or \"here comes a storm\". Another excellent example of this is \"boche\", a corruption of the English \"bull shit\", though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean a reprimanding, fulmination, or harangue in general terms. Hence, a common Dominican expression: \"Me echaron un boche\", \"they threw me a \"boche\"\", or \"they reprimanded me\". The pronoun \"they\" in Dominican Spanish often refers to the third person singular, so that \"me dijeron\", \"they told me\", is sometimes used instead of \"a man told me\", or \"a woman told me\", or \"the young boy by the lemon tree told me\". Furthermore, is the Dominican Spanish word for SUV, \"yipeta\", \"jeepeta\", or rarely \"gipeta\". This term is a corruption of the American \"Jeep\", which was the primary mode of transport for the GI's throughout the country during the occupation in the 1960s. Dominican license plates for SUVs are marked with a \"G\" for \"gipeta\", a variant of, and pronounced like, \"yipeta\", before their serial number. The word \"tichel\", from \"T-shirt\", also refers to a rugby shirt, association football jersey, or undershirt, and similarly, \"corn flakes\" and its variant \"con fléi\" can refer to any breakfast cereal, in Dominican Spanish, be it puffed corn, bran flakes, or puffed wheat. The borrowing \"polo shirt\" is frequently pronounced \"polo ché\".\n\nAnother phenomenon related to Anglicisms is the usage of brand names as common names for certain objects. For example, \"Gillette\" and its derivative \"yilé\" refer to any razor, and while the machete is known as \"machete\", this being originally a Spanish word, it is sometimes referred to as a \"colín\", derived from \"Collins & Co.\", name of a former Connecticut toolmaker.\n\n\n"}

Writing in several languages (Romanian, Yiddish, French), he focused his studies on the Romanian Jewish community, while steadily publishing articles and brochures which confronted antisemitism. The brother of literary historian Moses Schwarzfeld, Elias was the uncle of poet-philosopher Benjamin Fondane.\n\nHarassed and expelled by Romanian authorities, Schwarzfeld settled in France and became a French citizen. While pursuing his literary and scientific activities, he also worked as an assistant to Maurice de Hirsch, managing his various philanthropic projects and, after 1891, the Jewish Colonization Association.\n\nBorn in Iaşi, Elias Schwarzfeld belonged to a family of intellectual prominence: his father B. Schwarzfeld was a poet and owner of a large book collection. The future writer, who was two years older than Moses, also had a sister, Adela Schwarzfeld-Wechsler (1859 – 1953), mother of Benjamin Fondane. Elias received his early education in the city's public schools, and while still a student, between 1871 and 1873, contributed to the Iaşi papers \"Curierul de Iaşi\" and \"Noul Curier Român\". Like his two siblings, Elias was raised within an intellectual environment shaped by \"Junimea\" literary society, his family being acquainted with several of \"Junimea\"s leading members.\n\nIn 1872, Schwarzfeld participated in setting up \"Vocea Aparătorului\" (\"The Defender's Voice\"), a review started on behalf of the Jews. In May 1874, he founded in Iaşi \"Revista Israelitică\" (\"The Israelites' Review\"), in which he published his first Jewish novel, \"Darascha\". From 1874 to 1876, Elias Schwarzfeld studied medicine at the University of Bucharest, abandoning it later to take up the study of law. In 1881, he became a Doctor of Law, the title being awarded to him by the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.\n\nBetween 1877 and 1878, Schwarzfeld edited the Yiddish daily \"Jüdischer Telegraf\"; after this had ceased publication, he edited the Yiddish biweekly \"Ha-Yoetz\". During this period, Schwarzfeld became interested in advancing the cause of the non-emancipated Jewish community in the Kingdom of Romania: in 1878 he published his first pamphlet, \"Chestia şcoalelor israelite şi a progresului israelit în România\" (\"The Issue of Israelite Schools and the Israelite Progress in Romania\"), occasioned by a circular which the Alliance Israélite Universelle had issued calling for information regarding the state of education among the Romanian Jews.\n\nIn 1881, on settling in Bucharest, he took charge of the paper \"Fraternitatea\" (\"Brotherhood\"). He was at this time one of the principal collaborators on \"Anuarul pentru Israeliţi\" (\"Yearbook for Israelites\"), founded by his brother Moses in 1877. Presided upon by scholar Moses Gaster, the \"Anuarul pentru Israeliţi\" staff, Elias included, promoted a moderate assimilationist agenda (\"Haskalah\"). It was in this journal that he published, from 1884 to 1898, his numerous studies on the history of the Jews in Romania. In 1883, he published another novel, \"Rabinul făcător de minuni, conte populaire\" (\"The Miraculous Rabbi, a Folk Tale\").\n\nInvolved with the B'nai B'rith, an international service club for the Jewish communities, he was vice-president of the \"Fraternitatea\" lodge, and later as secretary-general of the supreme council of the Jewish lodges of Romania. In 1885 he published, in behalf of coreligionists in the small towns and villages, two pamphlets discussing cases of antisemitic persecution and Jewish reactions: \"Radu Porumbaru şi isprăvile lui la Fabrica de Hârtie din Bacău\" (\"Radu Porumbaru and His Doings at the Bacău Paper Mill\"), \"Adevărul asupra revoltei de la Brusturoasa\" (\"The Truth on the Revolt in Brusturoasa\").\n\nSchwarzfeld's activities having rendered him objectionable to the National Liberal government of Ion Brătianu, he was expelled October 17, 1885, only forty-eight hours being given to him to arrange his personal affairs. Driven out of Romania at roughly the same time as Gaster, who had also spoken out against official antisemitism, he consequently moved to France, settling in Paris. In 1886, he was appointed by Baron Maurice de Hirsch secretary of his private bureau of charity. When Hirsch founded the Jewish Colonization Association (1891), Schwarzfeld became its secretary-general; up to the death of Clara Baroness Hirsch he acted as her secretary in the distribution of her charities. Eventually, Schwarzfeld was naturalized a French citizen.\n\nFrom Paris, Schwarzfeld continued his literary activity in behalf of his Romanian coreligionists, and he was co-editor of \"Egalitatea\" (\"Equality\"), the Bucharest-based Jewish periodical founded in Bucharest by his brother. He had an international career as an essayist and historian: in 1901, the \"American Jewish Year Book\" published his \"The Jews of Rumania from the Earliest Time to the Present Day\" and \"The Situation of the Jews in Rumania Since the Berlin Treaty (1878)\"; an essay on \"The Jews of Moldavia at the Beginning of the Eighteenth Century\" appeared in \"The Jewish Quarterly Review\", vol. xvi., and another entitled \"Deux episodes de l'histoire des juifs roumains\" in the \"Revue des Études Juives\", vol. xiii. His \"Les juifs en Roumaine depuis le Traité de Berlin\" (\"The Jews of Romania since the Berlin Treaty\") appeared under the pseudonym \"Edmond Sincerus\" (London, 1901).\n\nElias Schwarzfeld also completed work on several new novels: in 1890, \"Bercu Batlen\"; in 1895, \"Gângavul\" (\"The Stammerer\"), \"Beţivul\" (\"The Drunkard\"), \"Prigonit de soartă\" (\"Persecuted by Fate\"); in 1896, \"O fată bătrână\" (\"An Old Maid\"), \"Unchiul Berisch\" (\"Uncle Berisch\"), \"Un vagabond\" (\"A Vagabond\"), \"Schimschele Ghibor\", \"Judecata poporană\" (\"The People's Judgment\"); in 1897, \"Polcovniceasa\" (\"The Polkovnik's Wife\"). Most of these novels have been translated into the Hebrew language and published by M. Braunstein-Mebaschan. Schwarzfeld also translated into Romanian several novels by, among others, Sámuel Kohn, Leopold Kompert, Marcus Lehman, Ludwig Philippson, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. In addition, he published Romanian versions of Isidore Loeb's article \"Juifs\" (\"Jews\"), Arsène Darmesteter's pamphlet on the Talmud, and the two lectures by Ernest Renan on Judaism.\n\nElias Schwarzfeld's death was marked with an obituary piece in the Jewish magazine \"Mântuirea\", which was incidentally Benjamin Fondane's earliest contribution to this periodical. Fondane praised his uncle as \"the only historian of the Romanian Jews\", a \"living archive\", and the wager of a \"holy battle\" for the defense of Jewish rights. Schwarzfeld's contribution also earned posthumous praise in later decades. Writing in 1999, literary historian Z. Ornea described his predecessor's contribution to the field of Jewish Romanian history as \"remarkable\". In 2002, Editura Hasefer republished some of Schwarzfeld's scholarly contributions in an anthology edited by historian Lya Benjamin: \"Evreii în texte istoriografice\". It notably includes his posthumously published reply to Romanian ethnic nationalist historian Nicolae Iorga's \"Istoria evreilor în ţările noastre\" (\"The History of the Jews in Our Countries\", 1913).\n"}

Her father Karl Packeny was director of the Austrian Southern Railway. Until 1887 she attended the Vienna teacher training center.\n\nAfter she had refused some marriage proposals, her parents forced her to marry. In 1890 she married the eleven years older Bulgarian engineer and diplomat Ivan Johann Nestoroff and went with him to Sofia. The marriage was not happy. She felt at the mercy of her husband, a theme that influenced her literary works in many ways. In 1896 her narrative volume \"Is That Love?\" under the pseudonym Elsa Asenijeff, which she had chosen in memory of her deceased firstborn son Asen.\n\nIn 1896 she divorced Nestoroff. The Bulgarian state allowed her to use Asenijeff as her official name. In 1897 she went to Leipzig to study philosophy and economics. Her second son Heraclitus, born in 1896,  left her with the grandparents.\nAt a Literary Society festival in Leipzig for Detlev von Liliencron (1844-1909) and Frank Wedekind (1864-1918), she met the painter and sculptor Max Klinger (1857–1920). She became a model, muse and lover for him. Klinger did not make the relationship public. He paid for her expensive apartment in the prestigious music district (270 m² in Schwägrichenstraße 11, Hochparterre). She accompanied him on numerous trips and worked as a hostess at social events. She was considered an extremely impressive, fascinating, sometimes even extravagant personality. Their daughter Désirée was born on September 7, 1900, during a longer stay in Paris. She was given to a French foster mother.\n\nIn 1903, Klinger purchased a vineyard in Großjena, including a winegrower's cottage, which he converted into a normal residential building in order to be able to withdraw from the hectic city life of Leipzig with Asenijeff. More books of hers appeared. From 1912 she also wrote poetry.

In 1917 she had to give up the apartment in the Dufourstraße 18, in which she had moved in 1909. She only lived on a pension. She began a descent into poverty, associated with a certain decay of personality. Even a poetry book published in 1922 brought no change.\n\nElsa Asenijeff was completely isolated, had no connection to her Viennese relatives, and her daughter Désirée, who spent some time in Leipzig for the funeral of her father in 1920, did not make any closer contact with her. Lease debts eventually led to admission to the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Leipzig. Her incapacitation considered her a fraud and claimed damages because she still considered herself one of the greatest female writers.

{"id": "1195328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1195328", "title": "Erotic asphyxiation", "text": "Erotic asphyxiation\n\nErotic asphyxiation (variously called asphyxiophilia, hypoxyphilia or breath control play) is the intentional restriction of oxygen to the brain for the purposes of sexual arousal. The term autoerotic asphyxiation is used when the act is done by a person to him- or herself. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a \"gasper\".\n\nThe erotic interest in asphyxiation is classified as a paraphilia in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\" of the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nAuthor John Curra wrote, \"The carotid arteries (on either side of the neck) carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain. When these are compressed, as in strangulation or hanging, the sudden loss of oxygen to the brain and the accumulation of carbon dioxide can increase feelings of giddiness, lightheadedness, and pleasure, all of which will heighten masturbatory sensations.\"\n\nAuthor George Shuman describes the effect as such, \"When the brain is deprived of oxygen, it induces a lucid, semi-hallucinogenic state called hypoxia. Combined with orgasm, the rush is said to be no less powerful than cocaine, and highly addictive.\"\n\nConcerning hallucinogenic states brought about by chronic hypoxia, Dr. E L Lloyd notes that they may be similar to the hallucinations experienced by climbers at altitude. He further notes that no such state occurs in hypoxia brought about by sudden aircraft decompression at altitude. These findings suggest to him that they do not arrive purely from a lack of oxygen. Upon examining the studies on hypoxia he found that \"abnormalities in the cerebral neurochemistry involving one or more of the interconnected neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, and beta-endorphin had been reported in all the conditions associated with hallucinations.\"\n\nHistorically, the practice of autoerotic asphyxiation has been documented since the early 17th century. It was first used as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. The idea for this most likely came from subjects who were executed by hanging. Observers at public hangings noted that male victims developed an erection, sometimes remaining after death (a death erection), and occasionally ejaculated when being hanged. However, post-mortem ejaculation occurs in hanging victims after death because of disseminated muscle relaxation; this is a different mechanism from that sought by autoerotic asphyxiation practitioners.\n\nVarious methods are used to achieve the level of oxygen depletion needed, such as a hanging, suffocation with a plastic bag over the head, self-strangulation such as with a ligature, gas or volatile solvents, chest compression, or some combination of these. Sometimes, complicated devices are used to produce the desired effects. The practice can be dangerous even if performed with care and has resulted in a significant number of accidental deaths. Uva (1995) writes “Estimates of the mortality rate of autoerotic asphyxia range from 250 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.” Cases have also been reported in Scandinavia and Germany. Autoerotic asphyxiation may often be mistaken for suicide, which is a major cause of death in teenagers.\n\nDeaths often occur when the loss of consciousness caused by partial asphyxia leads to loss of control over the means of strangulation, resulting in continued asphyxia and death. While often asphyxiophilia is incorporated into sex with a partner, others enjoy this behaviour by themselves, making it potentially more difficult to get out of dangerous situations.\n\nIn some fatality cases, the body of the asphyxiophilic individual is discovered naked or with genitalia in hand, with pornographic material or sex toys present, or with evidence of having orgasmed prior to death. Bodies found at the scene of an accidental death often show evidence of other paraphilic activities, such as fetishistic cross-dressing and masochism. In cases involving teenagers at home, families may disturb the scene by \"sanitizing\" it, removing evidence of paraphilic activity. This can have the consequence of making the death appear to be a deliberate suicide, rather than an accident.\n\nThe great majority of known erotic asphyxial deaths are male; among all known cases in Ontario and Alberta from 1974 to 1987, only one out of 117 cases was female. Some individual cases of women with erotic asphyxia have been reported. The main age of accidental death is mid-20s, but deaths have been reported in adolescents and in men in their 70s.\n\nAutoerotic asphyxiation has at times been incorrectly diagnosed as murder and especially so when a partner is present.\n\nLawyers and insurance companies have brought cases to the attention of clinicians because some life insurance claims are payable in the event of accidental death, but not suicide.\n\n\nThe sensational nature of autoerotic asphyxiation often makes it the subject of urban legends. It has also been mentioned specifically in a number of works of fiction.\n\n\n\n"}

Its precise position within Tani is not yet certain, primarily because of its central location in the Tani area and the strong effects of intra-Tani contacts on the development of Tani languages. It is an endangered language according to the normal definitions, but prospects for its survival are better than many similarly-placed languages in the world.\n\nThe major Galo dialects are Pugo, spoken around the district capital Aalo; Lare, spoken to the south of Aaloo; and a dialect that can provisionally be called \"Northwestern\", spoken in the northwest near the Tagin area. There may be additional Galo dialects further north, which remains largely unresearched. There are numerous subdialects that often correspond to regional or clan groupings. Neighbouring languages include Assamese, Nepali, Bodo, Mising, Minyong, Hills Miri, Tagin, Nishi, Bori, Pailibo, Ramo and Bokar.\n\nPost (2007:46) lists a provisional classification of Galo dialects.\n\nLike most central and eastern Tani languages, Galo is largely synthetic and agglutinating. Two primary lexical tones are present – High and Low – which may reflect two Proto-Tani syllable tones; in modern Galo, the surface TBU (Tone-Bearing Unit) is the usually polysyllabic phonological word. A robust finite/non-finite asymmetry underlies Galo grammar, and clause chaining and nominalization are both rampant. No synchronic verb-serialization appears to exist, although what seems to have been proto-verb-serialization has developed into a very large and productive system of derivational suffixes to bound verbal roots.\n\nMajor (non-derived) lexical classes are noun, adjective and verb. Other grammatical features include postpositions, relator nouns, classifiers, an extremely large system of aspectual suffixes, and a rich set of constituent-final particles coding functions related to epistemological status (such as evidentiality), discourse/pragmatic status, modality, and other related functions. Case-marking is basically accusative; ergativity has not been found.\n\nGalo language is taught as third language in schools of areas dominated by Galo community.\n\n\n"}

With the Google Translator Toolkit, translators can organize their work and use shared translations, glossaries and translation memories. They can upload and translate Microsoft Word documents, OpenDocument, RTF, HTML, text, and Wikipedia articles.\n\nGoogle Translator Toolkit is supported by Google Translate, a web-based translation service. Google Translator Toolkit can be configured to automatically pre-translate uploaded documents using Google Translate.\n\nGoogle Translator Toolkit was released by Google Inc. on June 8, 2009. This product was expected to be named Google Translation Center, as had been announced in August 2008. However, the Google Translation Toolkit turned out to be a less ambitious product: \"document rather than project-based, intended not as a process management package but simply another personal translation memory tool\".\n\nGoogle claims that Google Translator Toolkit is part of their \"effort to make information universally accessible through translation\" and \"helps translators translate better and more quickly through one shared, innovative translation technology\". Originally the Google Translator Toolkit was meant to attract collaboratively-minded people, such as those who translate Wikipedia entries or material for non-governmental organizations. However, nowadays it is also more and more widely used in commercial translation projects.\n\n\"The significance of the Google Translator Toolkit is its position as a fully online software-as-a-service (SaaS) that mainstreams some backend enterprise features and hitherto fringe innovations, presaging a radical change in how and by whom translation is performed\". \n\nStarting with only one source language – English and 47 target languages in June 2009, Google Translator Toolkit now supports 100,000 language pairs.

First, users upload a file from their desktop or enter a URL of a web page or Wikipedia article that they want to translate. Google Translator Toolkit automatically 'pretranslates' the document. It divides the document into segments, usually sentences, headers, or bullets. Next, it searches all available translation databases for previous human translations of each segment. If any previous human translations of the segment exist, Google Translator Toolkit picks the highest-ranked search result and 'pretranslates' the segment with that translation. If no previous human translation of the segment exists, it uses machine translation to produce an 'automatic translation' for the segment, without intervention from human translators.\n\nUsers can then work on reviewing and improving the automatic translation. They can click on the sentence and fix a translation, or they can use Google‘s translation tools to help them translate by clicking the \"Show toolkit\" button.\n\nBy using the toolkit, they can view translations previously entered by other users in the \"Translation search results\" tab, or use the \"Dictionary\" tab to search for the right translations for hard-to-find words. In addition, translators can use features like custom, multi-lingual glossaries and view the machine translation for reference. They can also share their translations with their friends by clicking the \"Share\" button and inviting them to help edit or view their translation. When they are finished, they can download the translation to their desktop. For Wikipedia articles, they can easily publish back to the source pages.\n\nGoogle Translator Toolkit provides an API which is currently restricted to approved users.\n"}
{"id": "6085873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6085873", "title": "Goulash Communism", "text": "Goulash Communism\n\nGoulash Communism (Hungarian: \"gulyáskommunizmus\") or Kadarism (after János Kádár) refers to the variety of communism as practised in the Hungarian People's Republic from the 1960s until the Central European collapse of communism in 1989. With elements of regulated market economics as well as an improved human rights record, it represented a quiet reform and deviation from the Soviet principles applied to Hungary in the previous decade.\n\nThe name is a semi-humorous metaphor derived from \"goulash\", a popular Hungarian dish. As goulash is made with an assortment of unlike ingredients, it represents how Hungarian communism was a mixed ideology and how it no longer strictly adhered to Marxist–Leninist interpretations as in the past. Sometimes described as \"the happiest barracks in the socialist camp\", Hungary in this particular period enjoyed many amenities not available in the rest of the Eastern Bloc..\n\nIn 1962, six years after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the 8th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party declared the period of \"consolidation of socialism\" after 1956 to be over and that the \"foundations for the establishment of a socialist society\" had been achieved, which enabled a general amnesty of most people sentenced in connection with 1956. Under János Kádár, the party gradually curbed some of the excesses of the secret police and repealed most of the restrictions on speech and movement enacted in the Mátyás Rákosi era. In their place, the party introduced a relatively liberal cultural and economic course aimed at overcoming the post-1956 hostility toward the Kádár government.\n\nIn 1966, the Central Committee approved the \"New Economic Mechanism\" which eased foreign trade restrictions gave limited freedom to the workings of the market and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector. Though liberal in comparison to Soviet socialism, the first relaxation of economic control was far from posing the same threat as the 1956 reforms. Official policy employed different methods of administering the collectives, leaving the pace of mechanization up to each separately.\n\nAdditionally, rather than enforcing the system of compulsory crop deliveries and of workdays credit the collectivizers used monthly cash wages. Later in the 1960s, cooperatives were permitted to enter into related and then general auxiliary businesses such as food processing, light industry and service industry.\n\nGoulash Communism showed a far greater concern for public opinion and an increased focus on the present (rather than future) material well-being of the citizens than had been the case in the period preceding 1956. It provided a wider latitude for dissent than was the case in the rest of the Soviet bloc (in the words of Kádár, \"who is not against us is with us\"), modified the role of the Communist Party in the development of socialism (now interpreted as \"serving\" rather than \"commanding\"), reduced the formality of relations between the party and the populace at large, increased the scope of societal self-expression and self-management and refined the guiding Marxist–Leninist ideology with modified means of dissemination. Marxist–Leninist ideology is invoked in the desire to reform as seen in Imre Nagy's \"Reform Communism\" (1955–1956). He argues that Marxism is a \"science that cannot remain static but must develop and become more perfect\".\n\nHe attributes Marx to having created a method, meant to guide yet not entirely encompass socialism or its development. \"The theory of Marx – as Lenin stated – gives general guiding principles, which must be utilized in Britain in another fashion than in France, in France differently than\". This interpretation was not shared by the Soviet leadership, Nikita Khrushchev's response to Hungary in 1956 and Leonid Brezhnev's to Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the resulting Brezhnev Doctrine stating that though \"each socialist country had the right to determine the concrete form of its development along the path of socialism by taking account of the specific nature of their national conditions… the Soviet Union would not tolerate deviation from the principles of socialism and the restoration of capitalism\".\n\nThe result was a regime that was far less authoritarian than other Communist regimes—and certainly less so than the first seven years of undisguised Communist rule in Hungary. Generally, Hungarians had much more freedom to speak, write and travel than their counterparts in the Soviet bloc. For instance, samizdat publications were tolerated to some extent, and conversations with foreigners did not attract much official scrutiny. However, while Kádár's regime was somewhat more humane than most of its counterparts, it was not a liberal one either. The Communist Party still retained a monopoly of power, with the National Assembly being little more than a rubber stamp for decisions already made by the MSZMP and its Politburo. While having somewhat more latitude than in other Communist regimes, the media were still subjected to fairly onerous restrictions. The secret police operated with somewhat more restraint than in other Communist states, but were still a feared tool of control.\n\nHungary's economic resources were mobilized to better satisfy consumer demand by providing a more extensive assortment of consumer goods. Some economic reform measures were introduced to integrate limited market mechanisms into the framework of the planned socialist economy. An unfortunate result of this policy were rising economic stresses and high indebtedness which became evident by the late 1980s. Yet these economic crises were prevalent throughout the collapsing communist world. Hungary's mild diversity left it slightly better equipped.\n\nBeing a comparatively well-off country in the Eastern bloc, Hungary was the destination for tourists from other communist nations for whom visits to the West were much more difficult.\n\nSince 1989 and after the general disintegration of communist control in Central Europe, Hungary has adopted a Western-style multiparty political system and introduced thorough reforms aimed at establishing a capitalist market economy, enabling European Union membership and integration into a global market economy.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1991, Richard Utz applied the paradigm to Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Troilus and Criseyde\", claiming that the medieval English writer might show correspondences with the wave of anti-realist/nominalist thought engendered by William of Ockham and his intellectual contemporaries and successors, and coining the paradigm \"literary nominalism\" in the process. Since the early 1990s, various scholars have added their voices to the discussion of the paradigm, either to confirm or critique its value for literary studies. Various other terms, especially Ockhamism, have also been used especially in claims for the influence of William of Ockham on individual writers and their works. Prior to Quack and Utz, Umberto Eco's novel, \"The Name of the Rose\" (1980; English translation in 1983), had rekindled interest in the conflict between late medieval nominalism and realism. Eco's playful and ironic confrontation of both movements of thought questioned the somewhat simplistic separation present in mainstream histories of philosophy and theology.\n\nAmong the specific features writers of nominalism writers have found attractive for their practices are:\n\n\nMost discussions of literary nominalism center on the late medieval period and early modern periods, when many of the epistemological foundations of Neoplatonic realism were challenged. The majority of such discussions of literary nominalism have centered on the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, but also included Jean Molinet, the Pearl Poet, François Rabelais, John Skelton, Julian of Norwich, Chrétien de Troyes, the York and Townely Plays, Renaissance plays, Jonathan Swift, Miguel de Cervantes, and John Milton. A famous postmodern writer, Jose Luis Borges, took an inimical stand towards nominalism in his short story, \"Funes the Memorious.\"\n\n"}

Constitutionally, however, the official language of Malaysia is Malay, but the government from time to time refers to it as Malaysian. Standard Malaysian is a normative register of the Johore-Riau dialect of Malay. It is spoken by much of the Malaysian population, although most learn a vernacular form of Malay or other native language first. Malay is a compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools.\n\nArticle 152 of the Federation designates Malay as the official language. Between 1986 and 2007, the official term \"Bahasa Malaysia\" was replaced by \"\"Bahasa Melayu\". Today, to recognise that Malaysia is composed of many ethnic groups (and not only the ethnic Malays), the term \"Bahasa Malaysia\" has once again become the government's preferred designation for the \"Bahasa Kebangsaan\" (National Language) and the \"Bahasa Persatuan/Pemersatu\"\" (unifying language/lingua franca). The language is sometimes simply referred to as \"BM\" and often misnomered with the term \"Bahasa\". English continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts.\n\nThe Malaysian language is normally written using a Latin alphabet called Rumi, though an Arabic alphabet called Jawi also exists. Rumi is official while . The Latin alphabet, however, is still the most commonly used script in Malaysia, both for official and informal purposes.\n\nThe Malaysian language has most of its borrowings absorbed from Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese, Dutch, Sinitic languages, Arabic and more recently, English (in particular many scientific and technological terms).\nModern Malaysian Malay has also been influenced lexically by the Indonesian variety, largely through the popularity of Indonesian dramas, soap operas, and music.\n\nColloquial and contemporary usage of Malay includes modern Malaysian vocabulary, which may not be familiar to the older generation, such as \"awek\" (girl), \"balak\" (guy) or \"cun\" (pretty). New plural pronouns have also been formed out of the original pronouns and the word \"orang\" (person), such as \"kitorang\" (\"kita\" + \"orang\", the exclusive \"we\", in place of \"kami\") or \"diorang\" (\"dia\" + \"orang\", \"they\"). Code-switching between English and Malaysian and the use of novel loanwords is widespread, forming Bahasa Rojak. Consequently, this phenomenon has raised the displeasure of language purists in Malaysia, in their effort to uphold use of the prescribed normative language.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "446606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=446606", "title": "Modularity of mind", "text": "Modularity of mind\n\nModularity of mind is the notion that a mind may, at least in part, be composed of innate neural structures or modules which have distinct established evolutionarily developed functions. Somewhat different definitions of \"module\" have been proposed by different authors.\n\nHistorically, questions regarding the \"functional architecture\" of the mind have been divided into two different theories of the nature of the faculties. The first can be characterized as a horizontal view because it refers to mental processes as if they are interactions between faculties such as memory, imagination, judgement, and perception, which are not domain specific (e.g., a judgement remains a judgement whether it refers to a perceptual experience or to the conceptualization/comprehension process). The second can be characterized as a vertical view because it claims that the mental faculties are differentiated on the basis of domain specificity, are genetically determined, are associated with distinct neurological structures, and are computationally autonomous.\n\nThe vertical vision goes back to the 19th century movement called phrenology and its founder Franz Joseph Gall, who claimed that the individual mental faculties could be associated precisely, in a sort of one-to-one correspondence, with specific physical areas of the brain. Hence, someone's level of intelligence, for example, could be literally \"read off\" from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe. This simplistic view of modularity has been disproven over the course of the last century.\n\nIn the 1980s, however, Jerry Fodor revived the idea of the modularity of mind, although without the notion of precise physical localizability. Drawing from Noam Chomsky's idea of the language acquisition device and other work in linguistics as well as from the philosophy of mind and the implications of optical illusions, he became a major proponent of the idea with the 1983 publication of \"Modularity of Mind\".\n\nAccording to Fodor, a module falls somewhere between the behaviorist and cognitivist views of lower-level processes.\n\nBehaviorists tried to replace the mind with reflexes which Fodor describes as encapsulated (cognitively impenetrable or unaffected by other cognitive domains) and non-inferential (straight pathways with no information added). Low level processes are unlike reflexes in that they are inferential. This can be demonstrated by poverty of the stimulus arguments in which the proximate stimulus, that which is initially received by the brain (such as the 2D image received by the retina), cannot account for the resulting output (for example, our 3D perception of the world), thus necessitating some form of computation.\n\nIn contrast, cognitivists saw lower level processes as continuous with higher level processes, being inferential and cognitively penetrable (influenced by other cognitive domains, such as beliefs). The latter has been shown to be untrue in some cases, such as with many visual illusions (ex. Müller-Lyer illusion), which can persist despite a person's awareness of their existence. This is taken to indicate that other domains, including one's beliefs, cannot influence such processes.\n\nFodor arrives at the conclusion that such processes are inferential like higher order processes and encapsulated in the same sense as reflexes.\n\nAlthough he argued for the modularity of \"lower level\" cognitive processes in \"Modularity of Mind\" he also argued that higher level cognitive processes are not modular since they have dissimilar properties. \"The Mind Doesn't Work That Way\", a reaction to Steven Pinker's \"How the Mind Works\", is devoted to this subject.\n\nFodor (1983) states that modular systems must—at least to \"some interesting extent\"—fulfill certain properties:\n\nPylyshyn (1999) has argued that while these properties tend to occur with modules, one—information encapsulation—stands out as being the real signature of a module; that is the encapsulation of the processes inside the module from both cognitive influence and from cognitive access. One example is that conscious awareness of the Müller-Lyer illusion being an illusion does not correct visual processing.\n\nOther perspectives on modularity come from evolutionary psychology, particularly from the work of Leda Cosmides and John Tooby. This perspective suggests that modules are units of mental processing that evolved in response to selection pressures. On this view, much modern human psychological activity is rooted in adaptations that occurred earlier in human evolution, when natural selection was forming the modern human species.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists propose that the mind is made up of genetically influenced and domain-specific mental algorithms or computational modules, designed to solve specific evolutionary problems of the past. Cosmides and Tooby also state in a brief \"primer\" on their website, that \"…the brain is a physical system. It functions like a computer,\" \"…the brain’s function is to process information,\" \"different neural circuits are specialized for solving different adaptive problems,\" and \"our modern skulls house a stone age mind.\"\n\nThe definition of \"module\" has caused confusion and dispute. J. A. Fodor initially defined module as \"functionally specialized cognitive systems\" that have nine features but not necessarily all at the same time. In his views modules can be found in peripheral processing such as low-level visual processing but not in central processing. Later he narrowed the two essential features to \"domain-specificity\" and \"information encapsulation\". Frankenhuis and Ploeger write that domain-specificity means that \"a given cognitive mechanism accepts, or is specialized to operate on, only a specific class of information\". Information encapsulation means that information processing in the module cannot be affected by information in the rest of the brain. One example is that being aware that a certain optical illusion, caused by low level processing, is false does not prevent the illusion from persisting.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists instead usually define modules as functionally specialized cognitive systems that are domain-specific and may also contain innate knowledge about the class of information processed. Modules can be found also for central processing. This theory is sometimes referred to as \"massive modularity.\"\n\nA 2010 review by evolutionary psychologists Confer et al. suggested that domain general theories, such as for \"rationality,\" has several problems: 1. Evolutionary theories using the idea of numerous domain-specific adaptions have produced testable predictions that have been empirically confirmed; the theory of domain-general rational thought has produced no such predictions or confirmations. 2. The rapidity of responses such as jealousy due to infidelity indicates a domain-specific dedicated module rather than a general, deliberate, rational calculation of consequences. 3. Reactions may occur instinctively (consistent with innate knowledge) even if a person has not learned such knowledge. One example being that in the ancestral environment it is unlikely that males during development learn that infidelity (usually secret) may cause paternal uncertainty (from observing the phenotypes of children born many months later and making a statistical conclusion from the phenotype dissimilarity to the cuckolded fathers). With respect to general purpose problem solvers, Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby (1992) have suggested in \"The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and The Generation of Culture\" that a purely general problem solving mechanism is impossible to build due to the frame problem. Clune et al. (2013) have argued that computer simulations of the evolution of neural nets suggest that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, connection costs are lower.\n\nSeveral groups of critics, including psychologists working within evolutionary frameworks, argue that the massively modular theory of mind does little to explain adaptive psychological traits. Proponents of other models of the mind argue that the computational theory of mind is no better at explaining human behavior than a theory with mind entirely a product of the environment. Even within evolutionary psychology there is discussion about the degree of modularity, either as a few generalist modules or as many highly specific modules. Other critics suggest that there is little empirical support in favor of the domain-specific theory beyond performance on the Wason selection task, a task critics state is too limited in scope to test all relevant aspects of reasoning. Moreover, critics argue that Cosmides and Tooby's conclusions contain several inferential errors and that the authors use untested evolutionary assumptions to eliminate rival reasoning theories.\n\nWallace (2010) observes that the evolutionary psychologists' definition of \"mind\" has been heavily influenced by cognitivism and/or information processing definitions of the mind. Critics point out that these assumptions underlying evolutionary psychologists' hypotheses are controversial and have been contested by some psychologists, philosophers, and neuroscientists. For example, Jaak Panksepp, an affective neuroscientist, point to the \"remarkable degree of neocortical plasticity within the human brain, especially during development\" and states that \"the developmental interactions among ancient special-purpose circuits and more recent general-purpose brain mechanisms can generate many of the \"modularized\" human abilities that evolutionary psychology has entertained.\"\n\nPhilosopher David Buller agrees with the general argument that the human mind has evolved over time but disagrees with the specific claims evolutionary psychologists make. He has argued that the contention that the mind consists of thousands of modules, including sexually dimorphic jealousy and parental investment modules, are unsupported by the available empirical evidence. He has suggested that the \"modules\" result from the brain's developmental plasticity and that they are adaptive responses to local conditions, not past evolutionary environments. However, Buller has also stated that even if massive modularity is false this does not necessarily have broad implications for evolutionary psychology. Evolution may create innate motives even without innate knowledge.\n\nIn contrast to modular mental structure, some theories posit domain-general processing, in which mental activity is distributed across the brain and cannot be decomposed, even abstractly, into independent units. A staunch defender of this view is William Uttal, who argues in \"The New Phrenology\" (2003) that there are serious philosophical, theoretical, and methodological problems with the entire enterprise of trying to localise cognitive processes in the brain. Part of this argument is that a successful taxonomy of mental processes has yet to be developed.\n\nMerlin Donald argues that over evolutionary time the mind has gained adaptive advantage from being a general problem solver. The mind, as described by Donald, includes module-like \"central\" mechanisms, in addition to more recently evolved \"domain-general\" mechanisms.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2000 there were estimated to be approximately 9,750 speakers in the United States and Mexico combined, although there may be more due to underreporting.\n\nIt is the 10th most-spoken indigenous language in the United States, the 3rd most-spoken indigenous language in Arizona after Western Apache and Navajo. It is the third-most spoken language in Pinal County, Arizona, and the fourth-most spoken language in Pima County, Arizona.\n\nApproximately 8% of O'odham speakers in the US speak English \"not well\" or \"not at all\", according to results of the 2000 Census. Approximately 13% of O'odham speakers in the US were between the ages of 5 and 17, and among the younger O'odham speakers, approximately 4% were reported as speaking English \"not well\" or \"not at all\".\n\nNative names for the language, depending on the dialect and orthography, include \"Oʼodham ha-ñeʼokĭ\", \"Oʼottham ha-neoki\", and \"Oʼodham ñiok\".\n\nThe O'dham language has a number of dialects.\n\nDue to the paucity of data on the linguistic varieties of the Hia C-eḍ O'odham, this section currently focuses on the Tohono O'odham and Akimel O'odham dialects only.\n\nThe greatest lexical and grammatical dialectal differences are between the Tohono O'odham (or Papago) and the Akimel O'odham (or Pima) dialect groupings. Some examples:\n\nThere are other major dialectal differences between northern and southern dialects, for example:\n\nThe Cukuḍ Kuk dialect has null in certain positions where other Tohono O'odham dialects have a bilabial:\n\nO'odham is an agglutinative language, where words use suffix complexes for a variety of purposes with several morphemes strung together.\n\n\"For clarity, note that the terms Tohono O'odham and Papago refer to the same language; likewise for Akimel O'odham and Pima.\"\nO'odham phonology has a typical Uto-Aztecan inventory distinguishing 21 consonants and 5 vowels.\n\nThe retroflex consonants are apical postalveolar.\n\nMost vowels distinguish two degrees of length: long and short, and some vowels also show extra-short duration (voicelessness).\n\n\nPapago is pronounced in Pima.\n\nAdditionally, in common with many northern Uto-Aztecan languages, vowels and nasals at end of words are devoiced. Also, a short schwa sound, either voiced or unvoiced depending on position, is often interpolated between consonants and at the ends of words.\n\n\nThere are two orthographies commonly used for the O'odham language: Alvarez–Hale and Saxton. The Alvarez–Hale orthography is officially used by the Tohono O'odham Nation and the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community, and is used in this article, but the Saxton orthography is also common and is official in the Gila River Indian Community. It is relatively easy to convert between the two, the differences between them being largely no more than different graphemes for the same phoneme, but there are distinctions made by Alvarez–Hale not made by Saxton.\n\nThe Saxton orthography does not mark word-initial or extra-short vowels. Final generally corresponds to Hale–Alvarez and final to Hale–Alvarez :\n\n\nThere is some disagreement among speakers as to whether the spelling of words should be only phonetic or whether etymological principles should be considered as well.\n\nFor example, oamajda\" vs. wuamajda\" (\"frybread\"; some people may also use a \"c\" instead of a \"j\"), \"oam\" means \"yellow/brown/orange\" and thus is a compound word of sorts. Some people believe it should begin like any word that starts with a , \"wua\", while others think its spelling should match that of the word \"oam\" (\"oam\" is in fact a form of \"s-oam\", so while it could be spelled \"wuam\" itself, it is not since it is just a different declension of the same word) to reflect its etymology.\n\nO'odham has relatively free word order within clauses; for example, all of the following sentences mean \"the boy brands the pig\":\n\n\nIn principle, these could also mean \"the pig brands the boy\", but such an interpretation would require an unusual context.\n\nDespite the general freedom of sentence word order, O'odham is fairly strictly verb-second in its placement of the auxiliary verb (in the above sentences, it is \"ʼo\"):\n\n\nVerbs are inflected for aspect (imperfective \"cipkan\", perfective \"cipk\"), tense (future imperfective \"cipkanad\"), and number (plural \"cicpkan\"). Number agreement displays absolutive behavior: verbs agree with the number of the subject in intransitive sentences, but with that of the object in transitive sentences:\n\n\nThe main verb agrees with the object for person (\"ha-\" in the above example), but the auxiliary agrees with the subject: \"ʼa:ñi ʼañ g kokji ha-cecposid\" \"I am branding the pigs\".\n\nThree numbers are distinguished in nouns: singular, plural, and distributive, though not all nouns have distinct forms for each. Most distinct plurals are formed by reduplication and often vowel loss plus other occasional morphophonemic changes, and distributives are formed from these by gemination of the reduplicated consonant:\n\n\nO'odham adjectives can act both attributively modifying nouns and predicatively as verbs, with no change in form.\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from Oʼodham Piipaash Language Program: \"Taḏai\". It exemplifies the Salt River dialect.\n\nIn Saxton orthography:\n\n\n"}

They can be contrasted with \"free-sites\", which do not charge a membership fee. Most paysites offer \"free tours\" which allow non-members to view a limited number of short trailers. The vast majority of paysite memberships are bought by men. Some of the earliest paysites began by scanning images from pornographic magazines. The number of sites then grew until the market was saturated, and now many thousands of sites cater to every legal pornographic niche.\n\nBecause there is free porn available on the Internet (e.g. thumbnail gallery post (TGP) and streaming video sites, not to mention piracy), and some individuals cannot afford to or do not wish to purchase paysite memberships, some consumers of pornography view only free pornography. However, paysites are often one of the main originators of new content; they are one way an administrator can pay for the bandwidth costs and they are one of the most conspicuous ways in the industry to try to turn a profit. Theoretically, the more revenue a site takes in, the higher quality content it can produce.\n\nPayment methods include credit card or checking account billing. Bills routinely appear on statements as transactions under the name of a billing entity with a neutral-sounding company name (ostensibly for discretionary reasons) and may not be readily recognized as paysite billing transactions upon casual perusal of bank statements.\n\nMost paysites prevent unauthorized access to their members area by means of a username and password.\n\nA problem that paysites have is copyright protection, even with well-secured sites: there are cases of so-called \"site rips\", i.e. sites are either hacked, or subscribers redistributed content from a members' area without authorization; there have thus been sightings of original content on other TGP sites or entire site rip archives on file sharing networks. Some sites sell site rips of paysites. Administrators may try to counter these problems by employing digital rights management technologies.\n\nBecause members must confirm some details of their identity when they make their payment, a touted advantage of paysites is the potential to keep minors from the viewing of their content, which, in several jurisdictions, including the United States, is illegal. The issue of how to protect these Internet audiences from pornographic material deemed harmful to them has been widely debated in the U.S. in light of the 1998 federal Child Online Protection Act, although websites hosted in the United States are required by law to publish contact information for the custodian of records.\n\nMany paysites attract potential paying customers by providing a portion of their content for free via free hosted galleries (FHGs), and use an affiliate program to drive new traffic to those FHGs. The percentage of unique visitors to FHGs who become paying members is known as the \"conversion ratio\".\n\nWith so many paysites and so much free porn being readily available the pricing of many paysites has dropped in recent years to increase subscriptions. This has seen the rise of discount sites that offer reduced price memberships to a variety of paysites. Paysites have also increased the quality of their content to attract memberships, with many now offering 4K videos to their members.\n\n\n"}

Conducted by 3500 volunteers, including 2000 language experts, social historians and the staff of the NGO Bhasha Research and Publication Centre, Baroda, the survey has identified 780 languages in India. The 35,000 page survey is being published in 50 volumes.The first six volumes were released at the BhashaVasudha Global Languages Conference in Vadodara on January 7, 2012. The survey was completed in December 2012 and several of its volumes are being published by the publishing house Orient Blackswan.\n\nThe publications of the survey include the following information: \n\nFor scheduled languages, the survey also provides a broad cultural overview of each language.\n\nThe Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India recognizes 22 scheduled languages, excluding English, and the linguistic policies and funding of the Indian government are organised around this information. However, this information does not adequately convey the linguistic diversity of India. The 1961 Census of India had recorded 1652 languages being in use in India. However, it was decided to exclude languages spoken by less than 10,000 people in the 1971 Census, which brought down the figure to 108 languages. PLSI has followed the policy of including all languages in the survey, irrespective of the number of users. For example, it records a language called Chaimal in Tripura, which is spoken by only five people.\n\nPLSI also highlights the phenomenon of dying languages. \"On 26 January 2010, a lady who belonged to a community called Bo died in the Andaman Islands and she was the last speaker of her language that was also called Bo. Sadly, along with her, the continuous line of wisdom of 65,000 years was also gone.\" said Ganesh Devy, the Chairperson of Bhasha Research and Publication Centre. Observing a link between changing economic realities and the survival of languages, Devy contends that \"a language disappears when the livelihood options of the speech community disappear.\"\n\nOf all the languages documented by PLSI, 480 are languages spoken by tribals and nomadic tribes, while about 80 are coastal languages. Arunachal Pradesh is the state with the highest number of languages, with as many as 66 languages spoken there, while West Bengal has the highest number of scripts, nine, and around 38 languages. The scripts that exist in Bengal are Ol Chicki (Santhal), Kol Ho, Barangh Kshiti, Lepcha, Sadri and Limbu besides Bengali, Urdu and Nepali. Languages with increasing numbers of speakers are Byari in Karnataka, Bhojpuri in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Khasi in Meghalaya, Mizo in Mizoram, Kumouni in Uttarakhand, Kutchhi in Gujarat and Mewati in Rajasthan. 400 million of the Indian population speak Hindi and it remains the most popular language of India, while the number of Indian people with English as their mother language has gone up from one hundred eighty-seven thousand in 1971 to 10 million in 2011.\n\n"}

He is principally known for his book on agriculture, \"Opus agriculturae\", sometimes known as \"De re rustica\".\n\nSince the Middle Ages, authors of agricultural treatises have referred often to Palladius. The Palladii were a prominent Gallic family, and the name \"Palladius\" is probably a family name (of Greek origin), with Aemilianus his \"cognomen\" (of Roman origin). In Late Antiquity, the convention of the \"tria nomina\" (\"three names\") for Roman men was no longer standard, and the greater variation in naming practice contributes to the uncertainty over the correct order of his names. Evidence for his life is scant. Manuscripts of his work call him a \"vir inlustris\". Although Palladius relies heavily on earlier agricultural writers, mainly Columella and Gargilius Martialis, he also seems to have some first-hand knowledge of farming in Italy and Sardinia as well as experience as a landowner.\n\nThe \"Opus agriculturae\" is a treatise on farming in 14 parts or books, written in the late fourth or early fifth century AD. The first book is general and introductory. Books 2 to 13 give detailed instructions for the typical activities on a Roman farm for each month of the year, starting with January. The fourteenth book, \"De Veterinaria Medicina\", was rediscovered only in the 20th century, and gives instructions for the care of animals and elements of veterinary science. Most of the work is in prose, but the final part, formerly considered to be book 14, \"De Insitione\", on Grafting, consists of eighty-five couplets of elegiac verse.\n\nThe agricultural writings of Palladius may be compared to those of Marcus Priscus Cato, Marcus Terentius Varro and particularly Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, whose \"De re rustica\" appears to have served as a model for Palladius, to such an extent that the \"Opus agriculturae\" has been described as an \"abridgement\" of Columella.\n\nThe work of Palladius was well known in the Middle Ages. A translation into Middle English verse survives from about 1420, entitled \"On Husbondrie\"; it can be seen as part of a genre of instructional agricultural writing that was to develop in England into works such as those of Thomas Tusser and Gervase Markham. Two notable thirteenth century works that draw on Palladius are the \"Commoda ruralia\" of Petrus de Crescentius, written c. 1305 and printed at Augsburg in 1471; and the \"Speculum Maius\" of Vincentius Bellovacensis (Vincent de Beauvais) written about 1250 and first printed in Strasbourg in 1473–76. There are a number of other \"incunabula\" or early editions.\n\nThe book is known for reference to a water-mill in Book 1, ch. 41, where Palladius suggests that waste water from an aqueduct should be used to drive a mill. Such mills had been described by Vitruvius in 25 BC, and there is a growing number of examples of such Roman water-mills. The most spectacular is the set of 16 mills at Barbegal in southern France, using water fed by a stone aqueduct along the line of the same aqueduct which supplied nearby Arles.\n\nThe earliest editions of Palladius group his works with those on agriculture of Cato the Elder, Varro and Columella. Some modern library catalogues follow Brunet in listing these under \"Rei rusticae scriptores\" or \"Scriptores rei rusticae\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "143177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143177", "title": "Sparkling wine", "text": "Sparkling wine\n\nSparkling wine is a wine with significant levels of carbon dioxide in it, making it fizzy. Commonly called champagne, EU countries legally reserve that term for products exclusively produced in the Champagne region of France. Usually sparkling wine is white or rosé, but there are examples of red sparkling wines such as the Italian Brachetto, Bonarda and Lambrusco, Australian sparkling Shiraz, and Azerbaijani \"Pearl of Azerbaijan\" made from Madrasa grapes. The sweetness of sparkling wine can range from very dry \"brut\" styles to sweeter \"doux\" varieties (French for 'raw' and 'sweet', respectively).\n\nThe sparkling quality of these wines comes from its carbon dioxide content and may be the result of natural fermentation, either in a bottle, as with the traditional method, in a large tank designed to withstand the pressures involved (as in the Charmat process), or as a result of simple carbon dioxide injection in some cheaper sparkling wines.\n\nIn EU countries, the word \"champagne\" is reserved by law only for sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France. The French terms \"Mousseux\" and \"Crémant\" refer to sparkling wine not made in the Champagne region, such as Blanquette de Limoux produced in Southern France. Sparkling wines are produced around the world, and are often referred to by their local name or region, such as Espumante from Portugal, Cava from Spain, Prosecco, Franciacorta, Trento DOC, Oltrepò Pavese Metodo Classico and Asti from Italy (the generic Italian term for sparkling wine being \"spumante\"), and Cap Classique from South Africa. Sparkling wines have been produced in Central and Eastern Europe since the early 19th-century. \"Champagne\" was further popularised in the region, late in the century, when József Törley started production in Hungary using French methods, learned as an apprentice in Reims. Törley has since become one of the largest European producers of sparkling wine. The United States is a significant producer of sparkling wine today, with producers in numerous states. Recently, production of sparkling wine has re-started in the United Kingdom after a long hiatus.\n\nEffervescence has been observed in wine throughout history and has been noted by Ancient Greek and Roman writers, but the cause of this mysterious appearance of bubbles was not understood. Over time it has been attributed to phases of the moon as well as both good and evil spirits.\n\nThe tendency of still wine from the Champagne region to lightly sparkle was noted in the Middle Ages but this was considered a wine fault and was disdained in early Champagne winemaking although it made the pride of other historic sparkling wine production areas like Limoux. Dom Pérignon was originally charged by his superiors at the Abbey of Hautvillers to get rid of the bubbles since the pressure in the bottles caused many of them to burst in the cellar. Later, when deliberate sparkling wine production increased in the early 18th century, cellar workers would still have to wear a heavy iron mask that resembled a baseball catcher's mask to prevent injury from spontaneously bursting bottles. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The mysterious circumstance surrounding the then unknown process of fermentation and carbonic gas caused some critics to call the sparkling creations \"The Devil's Wine\".\n\nThe British were the first to see the tendency of wines from Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait and tried to understand why it produced bubbles. Wine was often transported to England in wooden wine barrels where merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, English glass production used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than the wood-fired French glass. The English also rediscovered the use of cork stoppers, once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. During the cold winters of the Champagne region, temperatures would drop so low that the fermentation process was prematurely halted—leaving some residual sugar and dormant yeast. When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England, the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork-stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas. When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly. In 1662, the English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling and that by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it, nearly any wine could be made to sparkle. This is one of the first known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and even suggests that British merchants were producing \"sparkling Champagne\" before the French Champenois were deliberately making it.\n\nFully sparkling wines, such as Champagne, are generally sold with 5 to 6 atmospheres of pressure in the bottle. This is nearly twice the pressure found in an automobile tire. European Union regulations define a sparkling wine as any wine with an excess of 3 atmospheres in pressure. These include German \"Sekt\", Spanish \"Espumoso\", Italian \"Spumante\" and French \"Crémant\" or \"Mousseux\" wines. Semi-sparkling wines are defined as those with between 1 and 2.5 atmospheres of pressures and include German \"spritzig\", Italian \"frizzante\" and French \"pétillant\" wines. The amount of pressure in the wine is determined by the amount of sugar added during the tirage stage at the beginning of the secondary fermentation with more sugar producing increased amount of carbon dioxide gas and thus pressure in the wine.\n\nWhile the majority of sparkling wines are white or rosé, Australia, Italy and Moldova each have a sizable production of red sparkling wines. Of these, Italy has the longest tradition in red sparkling wine-making, with notable wines including Brachetto and semi sparkling Lambrusco. In Australia, red sparkling wines are often made from the Shiraz grape. \"Pearl of Azerbaijan\" is a kind of red sparkling wine made from Madrasa grapes in Azerbaijan.\n\nThe viticultural and winemaking practices of making sparkling wine have many similarities to the production of still wine with some noted divergence. At the vineyard, grapes are harvested early when there is still high acid levels. In areas like Australia, winemakers aim to harvest the grapes at 17 to 20° brix. Unlike still wine production, high sugar levels are not ideal and grapes destined for sparkling wine production may be harvested at higher yields. Care is taken to avoid tannins and other phenolic compounds with many premium producers still choosing to harvest by hand rather than risk mechanical harvesting which may split the berries and encourage maceration between the skins and juice. The press house is often close by the vineyard to where the grapes can be quickly pressed and separated from their skins. Red wine grapes like Pinot noir can be used in the production of white sparkling wines because their juice is initially clear and is only later tinted red through exposure to the color pigments in grape skins. While some skin exposure may be desirable in the production of rosé sparkling wines and some \"blanc de noirs\" (white of blacks), most sparkling wine producers take extended precautions to limit the amount of skin contact.\n\nThe primary fermentation of sparkling wine begins like most other wines, though winemakers may choose to use specially cultivated sparkling wine yeasts. The wines may go through malolactic fermentation, though producers wishing to make fruitier, simpler wines will usually forgo this step. After fermentation the base wines are then blended to form a \"cuvee\". While there are examples of varietal sparkling wines, such as \"blanc de blancs\" (white of whites) made from 100% Chardonnay, most sparkling wines are blends of several grape varieties, vineyards and vintages. Producers with wide access to grapes will use wines from several hundred base wines to create a blend that reflect the \"house style\" of their non-vintage wine. It is through the initiation of a secondary fermentation that distinguishes sparkling wine production and gives the wine its characteristic \"bubbles\". One of the by products of fermentation is the creation of carbon dioxide gas. While this gas is able to be released during the first fermentation, efforts are taken during the second fermentation to retain the gas and have it dissolve into the wine. This creates a high pressure within the wine bottle (on average around 5 atmospheres) and wine producers take care to package the wine in strong glass bottles. When the wine is open and poured into a glass, the gas is released and the wine becomes sparkling.\n\nThere are several methods used to carry out this secondary fermentation. The most well known is the \"Traditional\" or \"Champagne method\" where the base \"cuvee\" is bottled with a mixture of sugar and yeast. The introduction of a fresh yeast and food source (the sugar) triggers the fermentation process in the bottle that the wine will eventually be sold in. Through the process of riddling and eventually disgorgement, the dead yeast cells (lees) are removed from the wine while still maintaining the dissolved carbon dioxide gas. A dosage mixture of fresh wine and some sugar syrup is used to adjust the sweetness level of the wine after it has been disgorged.\n\nIn the \"methode ancestrale\" the disgorgement step is skipped and the wine is sold with the lees still present as sediment in the wine. In the transfer method, after the wines have gone through the traditional method including riddling and disgorgement, the bottles are emptied into a large tank where they are then transferred to small and large format wine bottles such as 3 liter \"jeroboam\" and small split sizes used on airlines. Numerous quality producers worldwide use the \"Traditional\" method to make their sparkling wines.\n\nThe \"Charmat method\" takes place in stainless steel fermentation tanks that are pressurized. The fresh yeast and sugar mixture is added to the wine which rapidly stimulates fermentation in the pressurized environment. The wine is then cooled, clarified and bottled using a counter pressure filler. The process of carbon injection (or carbonation), the method used to make soda pop fizzy, does not involve initiating a secondary fermentation but rather injecting carbon dioxide gas directly into the wine. This method produces large bubbles that quickly dissipate and is generally only used in the cheapest sparkling wines.\n\nAn initial burst of effervescence occurs when the sparkling wine contacts the dry glass on pouring. These bubbles form on imperfections in the glass that facilitate nucleation.\nNucleations are needed to stimulate the formation of bubbles because carbon dioxide has to first diffuse from the wine solution before it can rise out of the glass and into the air. A poured glass of sparkling wine will lose its bubbliness and carbon dioxide gas much more quickly than an open bottle alone would. The frothiness or \"mousse\" of the wine, along with the average size and consistency of the bubbles, can vary depending on the quality of the wine and the type of glass used.\n\nThe average bottle of Champagne contains enough carbon dioxide to potentially produce 49 million bubbles. (Wine expert Tom Stevenson puts the number at 250 million.) The bubbles initially form at 20 micrometers in diameter and expand as they gain buoyancy and rise to the surface. When they reach the surface they are approximately 1 millimeter in size. It is speculated that the bubbles in sparkling wine may speed up alcohol intoxication by helping the alcohol to reach the bloodstream faster. A study conducted at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom gave subjects equal amounts of flat and sparkling Champagne which contained the same levels of alcohol. After 5 minutes following consumption, the group that had the sparkling wine had 54 milligrams of alcohol in their blood while the group that had the same sparkling wine, only flat, had 39 milligrams.\n\nThe amount of sugar (dosage) added after the second fermentation and aging varies and will dictate the sweetness level of the sparkling wine. Wines produced within the European Union must include the sweetness level on the wine label. For wines produced outside the EU, the sweetness level is not required but if it is included on the label the terms used must conform to EU guidelines. \n\nThe most well-known example of sparkling wine is that of Champagne from the Champagne wine region of France. On average, Champagne is responsible for about 8% of worldwide sparkling wine production with many other regions emulating the \"Champagne style\" in both grapes used (generally Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier) and production methods—sometimes referred to as the \"Champagne method\". French sparkling wines made according to the Champagne method of fermentation in the bottle, but sometimes use different grape varieties, are known as \"Cremants\" and are governed under their own \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) regulations. Another style of sparkling wine found in France are those made according to the \"methode ancestrale\" which skips the process of disgorgement and produces wines with slight sweetness and still containing the particles of dead yeast matter in the form of lees in the bottle. The regions of Gaillac, Limoux and Clairette de Die are the most well-known producers of \"methode ancestrale\" wines.\n\nChampagne is produced at the far extreme of viticultural circumstances, where the grape struggles to ripen in a long drawn out growing season. Cool climate weather limits the varieties of grape, and the types of wine that can be made, but it is in this region that sparkling wine has found its standard bearer. The limestone–chalk soil produces grapes that have a certain balance of acidity, extract and richness that is difficult to replicate in other parts of the world. The Champenois vigorously defend use of the term \"Champagne\" to relate the specific wine produced in the Champagne wine region. This includes objection to the term \"Champagne style\" to refer to sparkling wines produced outside the Champagne region. Since 1985, use of the term \"methode champenoise\" has been banned in all wines produced or sold in the European Union.\n\nBlending is the hallmark of Champagne wine, with most Champagnes being the assembled product of several vineyards and vintages. In Champagne there are over 19,000 vineyard owners, only 5,000 of which are owned by Champagne producers. The rest sell their grapes to the various Champagne houses, \"negociants\" and co-operatives. The grapes, most commonly Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot meunier, are used to make several base wines that are assembled together to make Champagne. Each grape adds its own unique imprint to the result. Chardonnay is prized for its finesse and aging ability. Pinot noir adds body and fruit while Pinot meunier contributes substantially to the aroma, adding fruit and floral notes. The majority of Champagnes produced are non-vintage (or rather, multi-vintage) blends. Vintage Champagne, often a house's most prestigious and expensive wine, is also produced, but only in years when the producers feel that the grapes have the complexity and richness to warrant it.\n\nSparkling wines designated Crémant (\"creamy\") were originally named because their lower carbon dioxide pressures were thought to give them a creamy rather than fizzy mouth-feel. Though they may have full pressures today, they are still produced using the traditional method, and have to fulfill strict production criteria. In France, there are eight appellations for sparkling wine which include the designation Crémant in their name:\n\nThere is also a Crémant designation outside France:\n\nFrench appellation laws dictate that a Crémant must be harvested by hand with yields not exceeding a set amount for their AOC. The wines must also be aged for a minimum of one year. The Loire Valley is France's largest producer of sparkling wines outside of the Champagne region. The majority of these Crémant de Loire are produced around the city of Saumur and are a blend of the Chardonnay, Chenin blanc and Cabernet franc. AOC laws do allow cuvées with Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir, Gamay, Côt, Pineau d'aunis and Grolleau but those grapes are rarely used in a significant amount. In Burgundy, AOC laws require that Crémant de Bourgogne be composed of at least thirty percent Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Pinot blanc or Pinot gris. Aligoté is often used to fill out the remaining parts of the blend. The Languedoc wine Crémant de Limoux is produced in the forty one villages around the village of Limoux in the south of France. The wine is composed primarily of the indigenous grape Mauzac with some Chenin blanc and Chardonnay. The wine must spend a minimum of nine months aging on its lees. The sparkling Blanquette de Limoux is composed predominately of Mauzac and is aged for nine months.\n\nAs noted above, the designation Crémant was previously used for sparkling wines from the Champagne region which were produced with slightly less carbon dioxide and somewhat lower bottle pressure (typically 2–3 atmospheres instead of 5–6). These wines were rare in comparison to regular, full-pressure Champagne. The Crémant designation was also used for sparkling wines from the Loire valley, in the form of Crémant de Saumur and Crémant de Vouvray, without being defined as separate appellations. In 1975, Crémant de Loire was given formal recognition as an AOC, and was followed by Crémant de Bourgogne (1975) and Crémant d'Alsace (1976). When in the late 1980s lobbying by Champagne producers led to \"méthode champenoise\" being forbidden within the European Union as a designation for the traditional method, the term Crémant was given its present definition. This meant that the use of \"Crémant\" in the Champagne region was discontinued and additional French Crémant AOCs were created from 1990, starting with Bordeaux and Limoux.\n\nSince the designation Crémant is not reserved exclusively for French use (as a result of it replacing \"méthode champenoise\"), it may also be used by producers in other EU countries which fulfill the production criteria. Although such usage is rare, for example in Luxembourg, Crémant de Luxembourg is a designation within the \"Moselle Luxembourgeoise\" appellation, rather than a separate appellation, but otherwise follow the same rules as French Crémant.\n\nThere are also some other French appellations for sparkling wines, which do not carry the name Crémant. Some of these are exclusively sparkling wine appellations, and some are appellations allowing both still and sparkling wine to be made. The term \"Mousseux\" is French for \"sparkling\" and can refer to a sparkling wine made using methods other than the \"méthode champenoise\" such as the Charmat method, while \"Crémant\" can only be used for wines that have been made using the \"méthode champenoise\".\n\nSparkling-only are:\nEither still or sparkling are:\n\nCava is the name of a type of Spanish (mostly in Catalonia but also in other regions such as Valencia, La Rioja, Aragon, Extremadura) white or pink sparkling wine produced mainly in the Penedès region in Catalonia, 40 km to the south west of Barcelona, with the \"méthode champenoise\" but grape varieties different from grapes used in Champagne making. Cava is a Greek term that was used to refer to a \"high end\" table wine or wine cellar, and comes from the Latin word \"cava\" which means cave in English. Caves were used in the early days of Cava production for the preservation or aging of wine. Today Cavas have become integrated with Catalan and also Spanish family traditions and is often consumed at any kind of celebrations (baptism, marriages, banquets, dinners and parties). The sparkling wine of Cava was created in 1872 by Josep Raventós. The vineyards of Penedès were devastated by the phylloxera plague, and the predominantly red vines were being replaced by large numbers of vines producing white grapes. After seeing the success of the Champagne region, Raventós decided to create the dry sparkling wine that has become the reason for the region's continued success. In the past the wine was referred to as \"Spanish Champagne\" (no longer permitted under EU law), or colloquially as \"champaña\" in Spanish or \"xampany\" in Catalan.\n\nCava is produced in varying levels of dryness of the wine which are: brut nature, brut (extra dry), sec (in Catalan) seco (dry), semisec (in Catalan) semiseco (medium) and dolç (in Catalan) dulce (sweet). Under Spanish \"Denominación de Origen\" laws, Cava can be produced in six wine regions and must be made according to the \"Traditional Method\" with second fermentation in the bottle and uses a selection of the grapes Macabeu, Parellada, Xarel·lo, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Subirat. Despite being a traditional Champagne grape, Chardonnay was not used in the production of Cava until the 1980s.\n\nEspumante () is the Portuguese version of a sparkling wine. Unlike Cava, which is produced solely in northern climates, Espumante is not only produced in the northern wet region of Vinho Verde, but also throughout Portugal all the way to the southern region of the Alentejo, known for its extreme temperatures and arid climate.\n\nWhile Spain has one regulating body, DOC Cava, spread across several different political regions, quality Espumante is produced solely in DOC Bairrada, located just south of Vinho Verde. In order for a wine to be certified as a quality Espumante from DOC Bairrada, it must be made in the traditional champagne (indicating the year of harvest) and stamped with the VEQPRD (Vinho Espumante de Qualidade Produzido em Região Determinada) certification.\n\nVFQPRD is a regional sparkling wine made in the traditional champagne, charmat or transfer method in one of the following determined regions: Douro, Ribatejo, Minho, Alentejo or Estremadura.\n\nVQPRD is a sparkling wine that can be made by injecting the wine with gas in the traditional champagne, charmat, transfer method anywhere in Portugal.\n\nEspumoso is the cheapest and lowest level of sparkling wine, made by injecting the wine with CO2.\n\nTop-quality Espumantes can be found in Bairrada region and in Távora-Varosa sub region – Murganheira is an example of high-quality Espumante from this region.\n\n According to etymological sources, the term \"spumante\" was not used in a wine context until 1908, more than 40 years following the first Italian sparkling wine using the \"méthode champenoise\" produced by Carlo Gancia which was then sold as \"Moscato Champagne\".\n\nSparkling wines are made throughout Italy but the Italian sparkling wines most widely seen on the world market are the Franciacorta from Lombardy, Asti from Piedmont, Lambrusco from Emilia and Prosecco from Veneto. The Trento DOC is also famous. Though Franciacorta wines are made according to the traditional method, most Italian sparkling wines, in particular Asti and Prosecco, are made with the Charmat method.\n\nAsti is a slightly sweet wine made from the Moscato grape in the province of Asti. The wine is noted for its low alcohol levels around 8% and fresh, grapey flavors. Moscato d'Asti is a \"frizzante\" style slightly sparkling version of Asti; it is sweeter and contains even less alcohol, typically around 5.5%.\nThe Franciacorta region, located northwest of Brescia, is home to the largest segment of Italian sparkling wine production. Made predominately from Chardonnay and Pinot bianco, sparkling wine labeled under the Franciacorta DOCG is permitted to include no more than 15% Pinot nero. Both vintage and non-vintage Franciacorta sparkling wines are made which require 30 and 18 months, respectively, of aging on the lees. Franciacorta Satèn, a \"Blanc de blancs\", is produced with the reduced 4.5 atmospheres of pressure instead of 6 for an expression of softness.\n\nTrento DOC is an appellation for white and rosé sparkling wines made according to the méthode traditionnelle. Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot blanc and Pinot Meunier grapes are used. There is a maximum vien yield of 150 q.l. per hectare for all varietals, and a maximum grape yield of 70%. The wines must rest for a minimum of 15 months on their lees for non-vintage, 24 months for vintage, and 36 for riserva. Minimum alcohol content must be of 11.5%, or 12% for riserva. Trento DOC wines are distinguished by their straw-yellow color.\n\nProsecco is made in both fully sparkling (\"spumante\") and lightly sparkling (\"frizzante\") styles. The wine is produced in the cool hills around the town of Valdobbiadene and are generally dry but sweeter examples are produced.\n\nv.f.q.p.r.d. (Vini Frizzanti di Qualità Prodotti in Regioni Determinate): Quality \"Vini frizzanti\" made within defined regions are generally labeled as such.\n\nSekt is a German term for some sparkling wine. The majority of Sekt produced (around 95%) is made by the Charmat method with the remaining premium Sekt being made according to the \"méthode traditionnelle\". Cheap sparkling wine made with CO injection must not be called Sekt, but rather \"Schaumwein\" (German for sparkling wine, literally \"foam wine\"), semi-sparkling wine is called \"Perlwein\". Around 90 percent of Sekt is made at least partially from imported wines from Italy, Spain and France. Sekt labeled as \"Deutscher Sekt\" is made exclusively from German grapes, and \"Sekt b.A.\" (\"bestimmter Anbaugebiete\", in parallel to \"Qualitätswein b.A.\") only from grapes from one of the 13 quality wine regions in Germany.\n\nSome of the premium wines are often made using the Riesling, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris and Pinot noir grapes, with much of it drunk locally rather than exported. These Sekts are usually vintage dated with the village and vineyards that the grapes are from. Premium Sekt b.A. produced in smaller lots is often referred to as \"Winzersekt\" (winegrower's Sekt), since it is typically produced by a producer which has vineyards of his own, rather than by the large Sekt-producing companies (\"Sektkellereien\") which buy grapes or base wine on a large scale for their production. In Austria, the corresponding term is \"Hauersekt\".\n\nGerman production of sparkling wines dates back to 1826, when G. C. Kessler & Co. was founded in Esslingen am Neckar by Georg Christian Kessler (1787–1842), who had previously worked at the Champagne house Veuve Clicquot from 1807 to 1826. The names used by the German producers for their sparkling wines in the 19th century were \"Mousseux\", \"Sect\" or \"Champagne\" (or \"Champagner\"), but the 1919 Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany the use of this name, long before European Union regulations prohibited its use outside the Champagne region. Sekt was initially an informal German name for sparkling wine, coined in Berlin 1825, but was in common use by the 1890s. Germany long attempted to have the name Sekt reserved for sparkling wine from countries with German as an official language, but these regulations were annulled by the European Court of Justice in 1975. Another legal decision in the 1970s abolished the large producers' monopoly on Sekt production, allowing winemaking cooperatives and individual winegrowers to produce and sell their own sparkling wines. Together, these two decision produced the situation of the name Sekt being possible to apply to sparkling wines of varying quality level.\n\nSekt typically comes with elaborate enclosure (safety cage) to withstand its considerable CO pressure. It also comes with a \"Schaumwein\" tax, which since 2005 has been 136 euro per hectoliter, corresponding to 1.02 euro per 0.75 liter bottle. This tax was famously introduced by Emperor Wilhelm II in 1902 to fund the expansion of the Imperial Navy.\n\nGermans also call some similar foreign wines \"Sekt\", like \"Krimsekt\" (often red) from Crimea.\n\nIn Austria, Sekt is often made in the \"méthode champenoise\" with the Welschriesling and Grüner Veltliner grapes giving the wine a golden hue color. Sparkling rosé are made from the Blaufränkisch grape. Austria's history of producing sparkling wine dates back to the Austro-Hungarian empire. Most Austrian Sekt producers are based in Vienna and source their grapes from the Weinviertel region in Lower Austria. Like its German counterpart, Austrian Sekt can be made trocken (dry) or halbtrocken (medium dry).\n\nThe first Austrian producer of sparkling wine was Robert Alwin Schlumberger, who presented his first sparkling wine in 1846 under the name \"Vöslauer weißer Schaumwein\" (White sparkling wine of Vöslau). It was produced from Blauer Portugieser grapes growing in vineyards in Bad Vöslau which Schlumberger bought in 1843, and the sparkling wine was an immediate success. Stuttgart-born Schlumberger had worked in the Champagne house Ruinart before he moved to Vienna in 1842.\n\nThe first production facility outside France where sparkling wine was produced following the original French recipe was founded in 1825 in Pressburg (today Bratislava) by Johann Fischer and Michael Schönbauer, both Bratislava burghers. The company, later renamed \"Hubert J.E.\" after J.E. Hubert of the Hubert family, which bought the company from Johann Fischer in 1877, continues to produce sekt until today.\n\nThe Hungarian equivalent for sparkling wine is pezsgő. The beginning of significant sparkling wine production in Hungary is dated back to the first half of the 19th century. The first wineries of sparkling wine were founded near Pozsony (today Bratislava, Slovakia) by Johann Fischer and Dr. Michael Schönbauer in 1825 (the first in Central-Europe) and Esch és Társa in 1835. A couple of decades later the main producers moved to the Buda Hills and Budafok nearby the capital creating a new center of production, the so-called \"Hungarian Champagne\" still existing nowadays. At the end of the 19th century the two most important wineries were József Törley és Társa moving from Reims, France to Budafok in 1882 and Louis és César-François founded in 1886. After the Soviet era the Hungarian wine sector was reborn. New and old wineries are seeking for the forgotten roots. Most of the Hungarian sparkling wines are made by the charmat and transvasée methods and a small but steadily growing amount by the traditional, champagneois method. The sorts of grape used during production can be international like Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Riesling, Muscat Ottonel, Muscat Lunel or natives like Olaszrizling, Kékfrankos, Furmint, Királyleányka, Hárslevelű, Kéknyelű and Juhfark.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, sparkling wine was produced under the name Soviet Champagne, or Sovetskoye Shampanskoye, most of it sweet. This designation continues to be used for sparkling wine produced in several countries formerly part of the Soviet Union, including Georgia, Armenia, Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. Most likely, the name has stuck since Sovetskoye Shampanskoye was one of the few products or brands of the Soviet era which were seen as luxurious. Often the names have been altered to fit the exact country, e.g. Georgian Champagne. Nowadays, it is more common to encounter Sovetskoye Shampanskoye produced in a dry or semi-dry style. The products have some international popularity, thus Russian made dry and semi-dry versions can be found in the European markets and Moldovan made semi-sweet version from Muscat grapes has been regularly available in the U.S.\n\nIn Romania, sparkling wine is mostly made in Panciu. The same traditional method is used in Azuga, where the mountain climate is perfect for the second fermentation of white and rose sparkling wines in passively-cooled above-ground cellars. Grapes used (obviously not grown in this climate) are Chardonnay and a mix of Chardonnay and a Romanian variety called Fetească Regală. Rhein Azuga Cellars, now owned by Halewood International, was established in 1892 and still uses the same methods and even tools from that era. In 2006, they've become once again official Supplier to the Royal House of Romania, after having this honor between 1920 and 1947. Their Rhein Extra, still produced in the same building, was served at the coronation of King Ferdinand I at Alba Iulia, in October 1922.\n\nCommercial production of bottle fermented sparkling wines from grapes grown in England started in the 1960s, although there has been a longer history of sparkling wines made in the UK from imported grapes. In the 1980s, some English winemakers started to grow the grape varieties as used in Champagne – Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier – and in the ensuing decades availability of English sparkling wines made from these varieties increased. Today, there are over 100 vineyards in England producing sparkling wines with Nyetimber, Ridgeview and Chapel Down being some of the largest producers. In 2010, Chardonnay and Pinot noir were the two most commonly planted grape varieties in English vineyards. Along with Pinot Meunier, the three varieties combined accounted for around 40% of vines planted, which appears to reflect a significant growth in interest in English sparkling wines. Other varietals used are Auxerrois, Seyval blanc, Müller-Thurgau, Reichensteiner, and Bacchus. To put that in context, the current yield for all types of English wine averages to around 2 million bottles annually.\n\nSparkling wines produced in the United States can be made in both the méthode champenoise and the charmat method. Lower cost sparkling wines, such as André, Cook's, and Tott's, often employ the latter method with more premium sparkling wines utilizing the former. The history of producing quality sparkling wine in California can be traced to the Russian River Valley of Sonoma County where, in 1892, the Korbel brothers (emigrated from Bohemia in 1852) began producing sparkling wine according to the méthode champenoise. The first wines produced were made from Riesling, Muscatel, Traminer and Chasselas grapes. Partly aided by the foreign influence, the overall quality of Californian sparkling wine increased with the introduction of the more traditional sparkling wine grapes of Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot blanc into the production. US AVA requirements and wine laws do not regulate the sugar levels and sweetness of wine though most producers tend to follow European standards with Brut wine having less than 1.5% sugar up to Doux having more than 5%. As the sparkling wine industry in California grew, foreign investments from some of the Champagne region's most noted Champagne houses came to set up wineries in the area. These include Moët et Chandon's Domaine Chandon, Louis Roederer's Roederer Estate, and Taittinger's Domaine Carneros.\n\nWhile many top American sparkling wine producers utilize the traditional methods of production, there are distinct differences in their wine making techniques that have a considerable effect on the taste of the wines. In Champagne, the cuvée blend will rarely have less than 30 wines and sometimes as many as 60 that are taken from grapes spanning 4–6 years of different vintages. In California, cuvees are typically derived from around 20 wines taken from 1 to 2 years worth of vintages. Champagne laws require that the wine spend a minimum of 15 months on the lees for non-vintage and minimum 3 years for vintage Champagne. It is not uncommon for a premium Champagne to age for 7 years or more prior to release. In the US, there are no minimum requirements, and aging length can vary from 8 months to 6 years. Another distinct difference, particularly in Californian sparkling wines, is the favorable Californian climate which allows a vintage wine to be produced nearly every year.\n\nCurrent US regulations ban the use of the term \"champagne\" on any wines not produced in Champagne except if the label was in use before 2006. No new labels including the term \"champagne\" will be approved by the US Government for wines produced outside of the Champagne region of France after 2006. Those \"grandfathered labels\" can only use the term on a wine label if there appears next to that name the appellation of \"the actual place of origin\".\n\nThe growth of the Finger Lakes wine industry in New York State and the success of Riesling wines from the region has resulted in an increasing number of producers such as Swedish Hill Vineyards making méthode champenoise sparkling wines from primarily or 100% Riesling. Finger Lakes producers such as Glenora and Casa Larga are also producing méthode champenoise sparkling wine from other grapes such as the traditional Chardonnay and Pinot noir.\n\nCanada's sparkling wine producers are found in Southern Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec and Nova Scotia, where growing conditions mirror that of Champagne, Provence and Languedoc of France. In particular, Ontario's appellations are emerging as strong producers of dry sparkling wines as their cooler climate conditions are very conducive to producing excellent, flavourful and not-too-ripe grapes.\n\nWhile traditionally aimed at the domestic market, Canadian sparkling wines have recently gained prominence internationally. In 2011, L'Acadie Vineyards won a silver medal at an international competition for sparkling wines in France and in 2012, Benjamin Bridge winery's 2004 Brut Reserve placed higher than a Louis Roederer 2004 Cristal (wine) champagne at a blind tasting held with noted critics, bringing attention to the country's wine industry. In Ontario, wineries recognized for their sparkling wines include Henry of Pelham Winery, Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin.\n\nOntario, and in particular the Niagara Peninsula, is the largest wine growing region in Canada. Approximately 26 of the Niagara Peninsula wineries produce some sparkling wine, where annual production averages about 55,000 cases (500,000 litres). Sparkling wine is largely produced in the Traditional Method (65%), and a smaller proportion is produced in the Charmat method (35%). The Niagara Peninsula region's micro-climate is well suited for the growth of Chardonnay, Riesling, Vidal Blanc, Pinot Noir and Gamay grapes, which are the prominent varietals for Ontario sparkling wine. Ontario sparkling wines are often noted for having a character and aroma comparable to that of traditional Champagne, including biscuit, subtle yeast and palate cleansing bubbles.\n\nAn emerging sparkling wine-focused region in Ontario is Prince Edward County, Ontario. The County is noted for its Prince Edward County Wine and is the fourth and newest Designated Viticultural Area (DVA) in the Province. Like the Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County's terroir and micro-climate are well suited for cool climate grapes where wineries, such as The Hinterland Wine Company, specialize in the production of sparkling wines.\n\nSparkling icewine in Ontario was first crafted by Canadian wine writer Konrad Ejbich in his home cellar in Toronto. Unique to Ontario and generally referred to as Icewine Dosage, this sparkling wine is produced by topping a Traditional Method, dry sparkling wine with a dosage of Icewine, which is slightly off-dry with a hint of Icewine.\n\nAustralian sparkling wine production has come a long time in a very short period of time, according to Wine Australia 2014-2015 annual report with several notable French Champagne houses investing in production. \n\nTasmania is a centre of Australian sparkling wine production. Wine commentator James Halliday states \"the clear majority of the best sparkling wines are now solely sourced from Tasmania\", and Tyson Stelzer says \"Tasmania confidently holds its place as Australia’s sparkling capital\" with both the traditional grape varieties and method of secondary fermentation being employed. \n\nWhilst most sparkling wine is produced from Chardonnay, Pinot noir and possibly Pinot Meuniere, an Australian speciality is sparkling Shiraz, a red sparkling wine produced from Shiraz grapes. Most sparkling Shiraz is traditionally somewhat sweet, but some producers make it dry, full-bodied and tannic.\n\nSince 2012, Australian mass producers of sparkling wine have begun using screw caps in place of the traditional cork & wire closure.\n\nChile produces around 12 million bottles of sparkling wine per annum of which only around 1.6 million bottles are exported to overseas markets. Although sparkling wines have been made since 1879, they have not yet established a significant place in Chile's wine portfolio. In recent years, the Pais grape variety has been creatively employed on its own or in blends, to make modern wines that have received favorable reviews. A rise in consumer demand and an ever-broadening selection of cool climate grapes has led to an increase in fresh and delightful sparkling wines ranging from bone dry extra brut to off-dry demi-secs, from blanc de blanc to blanc de noir to sparkling rosé. Valdivieso produce 60% of all sparkling wine in Chile. Most is inexpensive tank method fizz, but 20% is very good quality Champagne method from Pinot and Chardonnay. There is also a product made from a blend of sparkling Pinot wine and fresh handpicked strawberry pulp.\n\nMéthode Cap Classique or MCC is the term used to describe sparkling wines made by the classic method of undergoing second fermentation in the bottle. There are quality standards that all producers adhere to voluntarily, apart from the minimum time on the lees (nine months) and the bars of pressure, which are mandatory in order to use MCC on the label. Traditional Champagne varieties such as Chardonnay and Pinot noir are mostly used for MCC production, however the use of other varieties are becoming increasingly popular and local MCC labels are seen with the likes of Sauvignon blanc and Chenin blanc. Sparkling wine is also made according to the Charmat method and red sparkling Pinotage can also be found. Methode Cap Classique tends to be very fruity due to the high temperatures of the South African Wine lands. The quality of MCC in South Africa can be compared to the wines produced in Champagne.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30403", "title": "Turing machine", "text": "Turing machine\n\nA Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.\n\nThe machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete \"cells\". The machine positions its \"head\" over a cell and \"reads\" (scans) the symbol there. Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a \"finite table\" of user-specified instructions, the machine (i) writes a symbol (e.g., a digit or a letter from a finite alphabet) in the cell (some models allowing symbol erasure or no writing), then (ii) either moves the tape one cell left or right (some models allow no motion, some models move the head), then (iii) (as determined by the observed symbol and the machine's place in the table) either proceeds to a subsequent instruction or halts the computation.\n\nThe Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing, who called it an \"a-machine\" (automatic machine). With this model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative: (1) Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is \"circular\" (e.g., freezes, or fails to continue its computational task); similarly, (2) does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol. Thus by providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation in general—and in particular, the uncomputability of the Entscheidungsproblem (\"decision problem\").\n\nThus, Turing machines prove fundamental limitations on the power of mechanical computation. While they can express arbitrary computations, their minimalistic design makes them unsuitable for computation in practice: real-world computers are based on different designs that, unlike Turing machines, use random-access memory.\n\nTuring completeness is the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine. A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers; nearly all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.\n\nA Turing machine is a general example of a CPU that controls all data manipulation done by a computer, with the canonical machine using sequential memory to store data. More specifically, it is a machine (automaton) capable of enumerating some arbitrary subset of valid strings of an alphabet; these strings are part of a recursively enumerable set. A Turing machine has a tape of infinite length that enables read and write operations to be performed.\n\nAssuming a black box, the Turing machine cannot know whether it will eventually enumerate any one specific string of the subset with a given program. This is due to the fact that the halting problem is unsolvable, which has major implications for the theoretical limits of computing.\n\nThe Turing machine is capable of processing an unrestricted grammar, which further implies that it is capable of robustly evaluating first-order logic in an infinite number of ways. This is famously demonstrated through lambda calculus.\n\nA Turing machine that is able to simulate any other Turing machine is called a universal Turing machine (UTM, or simply a universal machine). A more mathematically oriented definition with a similar \"universal\" nature was introduced by Alonzo Church, whose work on lambda calculus intertwined with Turing's in a formal theory of computation known as the Church–Turing thesis. The thesis states that Turing machines indeed capture the informal notion of effective methods in logic and mathematics, and provide a precise definition of an algorithm or \"mechanical procedure\". Studying their abstract properties yields many insights into computer science and complexity theory.\n\nIn his 1948 essay, \"Intelligent Machinery\", Turing wrote that his machine consisted of:\n\nThe Turing machine mathematically models a machine that mechanically operates on a tape. On this tape are symbols, which the machine can read and write, one at a time, using a tape head. Operation is fully determined by a finite set of elementary instructions such as \"in state 42, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1; if the symbol seen is 1, change into state 17; in state 17, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1 and change to state 6;\" etc. In the original article (\"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\", see also ), Turing imagines not a mechanism, but a person whom he calls the \"computer\", who executes these deterministic mechanical rules slavishly (or as Turing puts it, \"in a desultory manner\").\n\nMore precisely, a Turing machine consists of:\nIn the 4-tuple models, erasing or writing a symbol (a) and moving the head left or right (d) are specified as separate instructions. Specifically, the table tells the machine to (ia) erase or write a symbol \"or\" (ib) move the head left or right, \"and then\" (ii) assume the same or a new state as prescribed, but not both actions (ia) and (ib) in the same instruction. In some models, if there is no entry in the table for the current combination of symbol and state then the machine will halt; other models require all entries to be filled.\n\nNote that every part of the machine (i.e. its state, symbol-collections, and used tape at any given time) and its actions (such as printing, erasing and tape motion) is \"finite\", \"discrete\" and \"distinguishable\"; it is the unlimited amount of tape and runtime that gives it an unbounded amount of storage space.\n\nFollowing Hopcroft and Ullman (1979, p. 148), a (one-tape) Turing machine can be formally defined as a 7-tuple formula_1 where\nAnything that operates according to these specifications is a Turing machine.\n\nThe 7-tuple for the 3-state busy beaver looks like this (see more about this busy beaver at Turing machine examples):\n\nInitially all tape cells are marked with formula_19.\n\nIn the words of van Emde Boas (1990), p. 6: \"The set-theoretical object [his formal seven-tuple description similar to the above] provides only partial information on how the machine will behave and what its computations will look like.\"\n\nFor instance,\n\nDefinitions in literature sometimes differ slightly, to make arguments or proofs easier or clearer, but this is always done in such a way that the resulting machine has the same computational power. For example, changing the set formula_20 to formula_21, where \"N\" (\"None\" or \"No-operation\") would allow the machine to stay on the same tape cell instead of moving left or right, does not increase the machine's computational power.\n\nThe most common convention represents each \"Turing instruction\" in a \"Turing table\" by one of nine 5-tuples, per the convention of Turing/Davis (Turing (1936) in \"The Undecidable\", p. 126-127 and Davis (2000) p. 152):\n\nOther authors (Minsky (1967) p. 119, Hopcroft and Ullman (1979) p. 158, Stone (1972) p. 9) adopt a different convention, with new state q listed immediately after the scanned symbol S:\n\nFor the remainder of this article \"definition 1\" (the Turing/Davis convention) will be used.\n\nIn the following table, Turing's original model allowed only the first three lines that he called N1, N2, N3 (cf. Turing in \"The Undecidable\", p. 126). He allowed for erasure of the \"scanned square\" by naming a 0th symbol S = \"erase\" or \"blank\", etc. However, he did not allow for non-printing, so every instruction-line includes \"print symbol S\" or \"erase\" (cf. footnote 12 in Post (1947), \"The Undecidable\", p. 300). The abbreviations are Turing's (\"The Undecidable\", p. 119). Subsequent to Turing's original paper in 1936–1937, machine-models have allowed all nine possible types of five-tuples:\n\nAny Turing table (list of instructions) can be constructed from the above nine 5-tuples. For technical reasons, the three non-printing or \"N\" instructions (4, 5, 6) can usually be dispensed with. For examples see Turing machine examples.\n\nLess frequently the use of 4-tuples are encountered: these represent a further atomization of the Turing instructions (cf. Post (1947), Boolos & Jeffrey (1974, 1999), Davis-Sigal-Weyuker (1994)); also see more at Post–Turing machine.\n\nThe word \"state\" used in context of Turing machines can be a source of confusion, as it can mean two things. Most commentators after Turing have used \"state\" to mean the name/designator of the current instruction to be performed—i.e. the contents of the state register. But Turing (1936) made a strong distinction between a record of what he called the machine's \"m-configuration\", and the machine's (or person's) \"state of progress\" through the computation - the current state of the total system. What Turing called \"the state formula\" includes both the current instruction and \"all\" the symbols on the tape:\n\nEarlier in his paper Turing carried this even further: he gives an example where he placed a symbol of the current \"m-configuration\"—the instruction's label—beneath the scanned square, together with all the symbols on the tape (\"The Undecidable\", p. 121); this he calls \"the \"complete configuration\"\" (\"The Undecidable\", p. 118). To print the \"complete configuration\" on one line, he places the state-label/m-configuration to the \"left\" of the scanned symbol.\n\nA variant of this is seen in Kleene (1952) where Kleene shows how to write the Gödel number of a machine's \"situation\": he places the \"m-configuration\" symbol q over the scanned square in roughly the center of the 6 non-blank squares on the tape (see the Turing-tape figure in this article) and puts it to the \"right\" of the scanned square. But Kleene refers to \"q\" itself as \"the machine state\" (Kleene, p. 374-375). Hopcroft and Ullman call this composite the \"instantaneous description\" and follow the Turing convention of putting the \"current state\" (instruction-label, m-configuration) to the \"left\" of the scanned symbol (p. 149).\n\nExample: total state of 3-state 2-symbol busy beaver after 3 \"moves\" (taken from example \"run\" in the figure below):\nThis means: after three moves the tape has ... 000110000 ... on it, the head is scanning the right-most 1, and the state is A. Blanks (in this case represented by \"0\"s) can be part of the total state as shown here: B01; the tape has a single 1 on it, but the head is scanning the 0 (\"blank\") to its left and the state is B.\n\n\"State\" in the context of Turing machines should be clarified as to which is being described: (\"i\") the current instruction, or (\"ii\") the list of symbols on the tape together with the current instruction, or (\"iii\") the list of symbols on the tape together with the current instruction placed to the left of the scanned symbol or to the right of the scanned symbol.\n\nTuring's biographer Andrew Hodges (1983: 107) has noted and discussed this confusion.\n\nTo the right: the above table as expressed as a \"state transition\" diagram.\n\nUsually large tables are better left as tables (Booth, p. 74). They are more readily simulated by computer in tabular form (Booth, p. 74). However, certain concepts—e.g. machines with \"reset\" states and machines with repeating patterns (cf. Hill and Peterson p. 244ff)—can be more readily seen when viewed as a drawing.\n\nWhether a drawing represents an improvement on its table must be decided by the reader for the particular context. See Finite state machine for more.\n\nThe reader should again be cautioned that such diagrams represent a snapshot of their table frozen in time, \"not\" the course (\"trajectory\") of a computation \"through\" time and space. While every time the busy beaver machine \"runs\" it will always follow the same state-trajectory, this is not true for the \"copy\" machine that can be provided with variable input \"parameters\".\n\nThe diagram \"Progress of the computation\" shows the three-state busy beaver's \"state\" (instruction) progress through its computation from start to finish. On the far right is the Turing \"complete configuration\" (Kleene \"situation\", Hopcroft–Ullman \"instantaneous description\") at each step. If the machine were to be stopped and cleared to blank both the \"state register\" and entire tape, these \"configurations\" could be used to rekindle a computation anywhere in its progress (cf. Turing (1936) \"The Undecidable\", pp. 139–140).\n\nMany machines that might be thought to have more computational capability than a simple universal Turing machine can be shown to have no more power (Hopcroft and Ullman p. 159, cf. Minsky (1967)). They might compute faster, perhaps, or use less memory, or their instruction set might be smaller, but they cannot compute more powerfully (i.e. more mathematical functions). (Recall that the Church–Turing thesis \"hypothesizes\" this to be true for any kind of machine: that anything that can be \"computed\" can be computed by some Turing machine.)\n\nA Turing machine is equivalent to a single-stack pushdown automaton (PDA) that has been made more flexible and concise by relaxing the last-in-first-out requirement of its stack. In addition, a Turing machine is also equivalent to a two-stack PDA with standard last-in-first-out semantics, by using one stack to model the right side and the other stack to model the left side of the Turing machine.\n\nAt the other extreme, some very simple models turn out to be Turing-equivalent, i.e. to have the same computational power as the Turing machine model.\n\nCommon equivalent models are the multi-tape Turing machine, multi-track Turing machine, machines with input and output, and the \"non-deterministic\" Turing machine (NDTM) as opposed to the \"deterministic\" Turing machine (DTM) for which the action table has at most one entry for each combination of symbol and state.\n\nRead-only, right-moving Turing machines are equivalent to NDFAs (as well as DFAs by conversion using the NDFA to DFA conversion algorithm).\n\nFor practical and didactical intentions the equivalent register machine can be used as a usual assembly programming language.\n\nAn interesting question is whether the computation model represented by concrete programming languages is Turing equivalent. While the computation of a real computer is based on finite states and thus not capable to simulate a Turing machine, programming languages themselves do not necessarily have this limitation. Kirner et al., 2009 have shown that among the general-purpose programming languages some are Turing complete while others are not. For example, ANSI C is not Turing-equivalent, as all instantiations of ANSI C (different instantiations are possible as the standard deliberately leaves certain behaviour undefined for legacy reasons) imply a finite-space memory. This is because the size of memory reference data types is accessible inside the language. However, other programming languages like Pascal do not have this feature, which allows them to be Turing complete in principle. \nIt is just Turing complete in principle, as memory allocation in a programming language is allowed to fail, which means the programming language can be Turing complete when ignoring failed memory allocations, but the compiled programs executable on a real computer cannot.\n\nEarly in his paper (1936) Turing makes a distinction between an \"automatic machine\"—its \"motion ... completely determined by the configuration\" and a \"choice machine\":\n\nTuring (1936) does not elaborate further except in a footnote in which he describes how to use an a-machine to \"find all the provable formulae of the [Hilbert] calculus\" rather than use a choice machine. He \"suppose[s] that the choices are always between two possibilities 0 and 1. Each proof will then be determined by a sequence of choices i, i, ..., i (i = 0 or 1, i = 0 or 1, ..., i = 0 or 1), and hence the number 2 + i2 + i2 + ... +i completely determines the proof. The automatic machine carries out successively proof 1, proof 2, proof 3, ...\" (Footnote ‡, \"The Undecidable\", p. 138)\n\nThis is indeed the technique by which a deterministic (i.e. a-) Turing machine can be used to mimic the action of a nondeterministic Turing machine; Turing solved the matter in a footnote and appears to dismiss it from further consideration.\n\nAn oracle machine or o-machine is a Turing a-machine that pauses its computation at state \"o\" while, to complete its calculation, it \"awaits the decision\" of \"the oracle\"—an unspecified entity \"apart from saying that it cannot be a machine\" (Turing (1939), \"The Undecidable\", p. 166–168).\n\nAs Turing wrote in \"The Undecidable\", p. 128 (italics added):\nThis finding is now taken for granted, but at the time (1936) it was considered astonishing. The model of computation that Turing called his \"universal machine\"—\"U\" for short—is considered by some (cf. Davis (2000)) to have been the fundamental theoretical breakthrough that led to the notion of the stored-program computer.\n\nIn terms of computational complexity, a multi-tape universal Turing machine need only be slower by logarithmic factor compared to the machines it simulates. This result was obtained in 1966 by F. C. Hennie and R. E. Stearns. (Arora and Barak, 2009, theorem 1.9)\n\nIt is often said that Turing machines, unlike simpler automata, are as powerful as real machines, and are able to execute any operation that a real program can. What is neglected in this statement is that, because a real machine can only have a finite number of \"configurations\", this \"real machine\" is really nothing but a linear bounded automaton. On the other hand, Turing machines are equivalent to machines that have an unlimited amount of storage space for their computations. However, Turing machines are not intended to model computers, but rather they are intended to model computation itself. Historically, computers, which compute only on their (fixed) internal storage, were developed only later.\n\nThere are a number of ways to explain why Turing machines are useful models of real computers:\n\n\nA limitation of Turing machines is that they do not model the strengths of a particular arrangement well. For instance, modern stored-program computers are actually instances of a more specific form of abstract machine known as the random-access stored-program machine or RASP machine model. Like the universal Turing machine the RASP stores its \"program\" in \"memory\" external to its finite-state machine's \"instructions\". Unlike the universal Turing machine, the RASP has an infinite number of distinguishable, numbered but unbounded \"registers\"—memory \"cells\" that can contain any integer (cf. Elgot and Robinson (1964), Hartmanis (1971), and in particular Cook-Rechow (1973); references at random access machine). The RASP's finite-state machine is equipped with the capability for indirect addressing (e.g. the contents of one register can be used as an address to specify another register); thus the RASP's \"program\" can address any register in the register-sequence. The upshot of this distinction is that there are computational optimizations that can be performed based on the memory indices, which are not possible in a general Turing machine; thus when Turing machines are used as the basis for bounding running times, a 'false lower bound' can be proven on certain algorithms' running times (due to the false simplifying assumption of a Turing machine). An example of this is binary search, an algorithm that can be shown to perform more quickly when using the RASP model of computation rather than the Turing machine model.\n\nAnother limitation of Turing machines is that they do not model concurrency well. For example, there is a bound on the size of integer that can be computed by an always-halting nondeterministic Turing machine starting on a blank tape. (See article on unbounded nondeterminism.) By contrast, there are always-halting concurrent systems with no inputs that can compute an integer of unbounded size. (A process can be created with local storage that is initialized with a count of 0 that concurrently sends itself both a stop and a go message. When it receives a go message, it increments its count by 1 and sends itself a go message. When it receives a stop message, it stops with an unbounded number in its local storage.)\n\nIn the early days of computing, computer use was typically limited to batch processing, i.e., non-interactive tasks, each producing output data from given input data. Computability theory, which studies computability of functions from inputs to outputs, and for which Turing machines were invented, reflects this practice.\n\nSince the 1970s, interactive use of computers became much more common. In principle, it is possible to model this by having an external agent read from the tape and write to it at the same time as a Turing machine, but this rarely matches how interaction actually happens; therefore, when describing interactivity, alternatives such as I/O automata are usually preferred.\n\nThey were described in 1936 by Alan Turing.\n\nRobin Gandy (1919–1995)—a student of Alan Turing (1912–1954) and his lifelong friend—traces the lineage of the notion of \"calculating machine\" back to Charles Babbage (circa 1834) and actually proposes \"Babbage's Thesis\":\n\nGandy's analysis of Babbage's Analytical Engine describes the following five operations (cf. p. 52–53):\n\nGandy states that \"the functions which can be calculated by (1), (2), and (4) are precisely those which are Turing computable.\" (p. 53). He cites other proposals for \"universal calculating machines\" including those of Percy Ludgate (1909), Leonardo Torres y Quevedo (1914), Maurice d'Ocagne (1922), Louis Couffignal (1933), Vannevar Bush (1936), Howard Aiken (1937). However:\n\nWith regard to Hilbert's problems posed by the famous mathematician David Hilbert in 1900, an aspect of problem #10 had been floating about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely. Hilbert's original expression for #10 is as follows:\n\nBy 1922, this notion of \"Entscheidungsproblem\" had developed a bit, and H. Behmann stated that\n\nBy the 1928 international congress of mathematicians, Hilbert \"made his questions quite precise. First, was mathematics \"complete\" ... Second, was mathematics \"consistent\" ... And thirdly, was mathematics \"decidable\"?\" (Hodges p. 91, Hawking p. 1121). The first two questions were answered in 1930 by Kurt Gödel at the very same meeting where Hilbert delivered his retirement speech (much to the chagrin of Hilbert); the third—the Entscheidungsproblem—had to wait until the mid-1930s.\n\nThe problem was that an answer first required a precise definition of \"definite general applicable prescription\", which Princeton professor Alonzo Church would come to call \"effective calculability\", and in 1928 no such definition existed. But over the next 6–7 years Emil Post developed his definition of a worker moving from room to room writing and erasing marks per a list of instructions (Post 1936), as did Church and his two students Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser by use of Church's lambda-calculus and Gödel's recursion theory (1934). Church's paper (published 15 April 1936) showed that the Entscheidungsproblem was indeed \"undecidable\" and beat Turing to the punch by almost a year (Turing's paper submitted 28 May 1936, published January 1937). In the meantime, Emil Post submitted a brief paper in the fall of 1936, so Turing at least had priority over Post. While Church refereed Turing's paper, Turing had time to study Church's paper and add an Appendix where he sketched a proof that Church's lambda-calculus and his machines would compute the same functions.\n\nAnd Post had only proposed a definition of calculability and criticized Church's \"definition\", but had proved nothing.\n\nIn the spring of 1935, Turing as a young Master's student at King's College Cambridge, UK, took on the challenge; he had been stimulated by the lectures of the logician M. H. A. Newman \"and learned from them of Gödel's work and the Entscheidungsproblem ... Newman used the word 'mechanical' ... In his obituary of Turing 1955 Newman writes:\n\nGandy states that:\n\nWhile Gandy believed that Newman's statement above is \"misleading\", this opinion is not shared by all. Turing had a lifelong interest in machines: \"Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; [his mother] Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'\" (Hodges p. 96). While at Princeton pursuing his PhD, Turing built a Boolean-logic multiplier (see below). His PhD thesis, titled \"Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals\", contains the following definition of \"a computable function\":\n\nWhen Turing returned to the UK he ultimately became jointly responsible for breaking the German secret codes created by encryption machines called \"The Enigma\"; he also became involved in the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine), \"[Turing's] ACE proposal was effectively self-contained, and its roots lay not in the EDVAC [the USA's initiative], but in his own universal machine\" (Hodges p. 318). Arguments still continue concerning the origin and nature of what has been named by Kleene (1952) Turing's Thesis. But what Turing \"did prove\" with his computational-machine model appears in his paper \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\" (1937):\n\nTuring's example (his second proof): If one is to ask for a general procedure to tell us: \"Does this machine ever print 0\", the question is \"undecidable\".\n\nIn 1937, while at Princeton working on his PhD thesis, Turing built a digital (Boolean-logic) multiplier from scratch, making his own electromechanical relays (Hodges p. 138). \"Alan's task was to embody the logical design of a Turing machine in a network of relay-operated switches ...\" (Hodges p. 138). While Turing might have been just initially curious and experimenting, quite-earnest work in the same direction was going in Germany (Konrad Zuse (1938)), and in the United States (Howard Aiken) and George Stibitz (1937); the fruits of their labors were used by both the Axis and Allied militaries in World War II (cf. Hodges p. 298–299). In the early to mid-1950s Hao Wang and Marvin Minsky reduced the Turing machine to a simpler form (a precursor to the Post–Turing machine of Martin Davis); simultaneously European researchers were reducing the new-fangled electronic computer to a computer-like theoretical object equivalent to what was now being called a \"Turing machine\". In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the coincidentally parallel developments of Melzak and Lambek (1961), Minsky (1961), and Shepherdson and Sturgis (1961) carried the European work further and reduced the Turing machine to a more friendly, computer-like abstract model called the counter machine; Elgot and Robinson (1964), Hartmanis (1971), Cook and Reckhow (1973) carried this work even further with the register machine and random-access machine models—but basically all are just multi-tape Turing machines with an arithmetic-like instruction set.\n\nToday, the counter, register and random-access machines and their sire the Turing machine continue to be the models of choice for theorists investigating questions in the theory of computation. In particular, computational complexity theory makes use of the Turing machine:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14714237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14714237", "title": "Vocal resonation", "text": "Vocal resonation\n\nMcKinney defines vocal resonance as \"the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air.\" Throughout the vocal literature, various terms related to resonation are used, including: amplification, filtering, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation. Acoustic authorities would question many of these terms from a strictly scientific perspective. However, the main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the result of resonation is to make a \"better\" sound, or at least suitable to a certain esthetical and practical domain.\n\nThe voice, like all acoustic instruments such as the guitar, trumpet, piano, or violin, has its own special chambers for resonating the tone. Once the tone is produced by the vibrating vocal cords, it vibrates in and through the open resonating ducts and chambers. Since the vocal tract is often associated with different regions of the body, different resonance chambers might be referred to as: chest, mouth, nose/\"mask\", or head.\n\nIn more symbolic/perceptual way, rather than physical, the various terms applied can represent vocal \"colors\" in a continuous scale: from dark (\"chest\") resonance to bright (\"head-nasal\") resonance. We may call this spectrum a resonance track. In the lower range, the chest/dark color predominates; in the middle range, the mouth-nasal resonance is dominant; and in the higher range, the head-nasal resonance (bright color) predominates. The objective of using such images by several teachers and coaches is to achieve command of all the \"colors of the spectrum\". That, ultimately, may allow a greater scope of emotional expression. The emotional content of the lyric or phrase suggests the color and volume of the tone and is the personal choice of the artist.\n\n\nThere are some singers who are recognized by their pronounced nasal quality; whereas others are noted for their deep, dark, and \"chesty\" sound; and still others are noted for their breathy or heady sound; and so on. In part, such individuality depends on the structure of the singer's vocal instrument, that is, the inherent shape and size of the vocal cords and of the vocal tract.\n\nThe quality or color of a voice also depends on the singer's ability to develop and use various resonances by controlling the shape and size of the chambers through which the sound flows. It has been demonstrated electrographically in the form of \"voice-prints\" that, like fingerprints, no two voices are exactly alike.\n\nIn a technical sense resonance is a relationship that exists between two bodies vibrating at the same frequency or a multiple thereof. In other words, the vibrations emanating from one body cause the other body to start vibrating in tune with it. A resonator may be defined as a secondary vibrator which is set into motion by the main vibrator and which adds its own characteristics to the generated sound waves.\n\nThere are two kinds of resonance: \"sympathetic resonance\" (or free resonance) and \"forced resonance\" (or conductive resonance) The essential difference between both types is what causes the resonator to start vibrating. In sympathetic resonance there is no need of a direct physical contact between the two bodies. The resonator starts functioning because it receives vibrations through the air and responds to them sympathetically, as long as the resonator's natural frequencies of vibration coincides with the exciting oscillations. In forced resonance the resonator starts vibrating because it is in physical contact with a vibrating body, which \"forces\" the resonator to replicate its oscillations.\n\nBoth types of resonance are at work in the human voice during speaking and singing. Much of the vibration felt by singers while singing is a result of forced resonance. The waves originated by the airflow modulated by the vibrating vocal folds travel along the bones, cartilages, and muscles of the neck, head, and upper chest, causing them to vibrate by forced resonance. There is little evidence that these vibrations, sensed by tactile nerves, make any significant contribution to the external sound.\n\nThese same forced vibrations, however, may serve as sensation guides for the singer, regardless of their effect on the external sound. These sensations may provide evidence to the singer that their vocal folds are forming strong primary vibrations which are being carried from them to the head and chest. Thus these vibratory sensations can supply sensory feedback about the efficiency of the whole phonatory process to the singer.\nIn contrast, the sound a person hears from a singer is a product of sympathetic resonance. Air vibrations generated at the level of the vocal folds in the larynx propagate through the vocal tract (e.g. the ducts and cavities of the airways). In other words, the voice’s resultant glottal wave is filtered by the vocal tract: a phenomenon of sympathetic resonance. The vocal resonator is not a sounding board comparable with stringed instruments. Rather, it’s a column of air traveling through the vocal tract, with a shape that is not only complex, but highly variable. Vennard says:\n\nThere are a number of factors which determine the resonance characteristics of a resonator. Included among them are the following: size, shape, type of opening, composition and thickness of the walls, surface, and combined resonators. The quality of a sound can be appreciably changed by rather small variations in these conditioning factors.\n\nIn general, the larger a resonator is, the lower the frequency it will respond to; the greater the volume of air, the lower its pitch. But the pitch also will be affected by the shape of resonator and by the size of opening and amount of lip or neck the resonator has.\n\nA conical shaped resonator, such as a megaphone, tends to amplify all pitches indiscriminately. A cylindrical shaped resonator is affected primarily by the length of the tube through which the sound wave travels. A spherical resonator will be affected by the amount of opening it has and by whether or not that opening has a lip.\n\nThree factors relating to the walls of a resonator will affect how it functions: the material it is made of, the thickness of its walls, and the type of surface it has. The resonance characteristics of a musical instrument obviously will vary with different materials and the amount of material used will have some effect.\n\nOf special importance to singing is the relationship of the surface of a resonator to its tonal characteristics. Resonators can be highly selective-meaning that they will respond to only one frequency (or multiples of it)-or they can be universal-meaning that they can respond to a broad range of frequencies. In general, the harder the surface of the resonator, the more selective it will be, and the softer the surface, the more universal it will become. \"[A] hard resonator will respond only when the vibrator contains an overtone that is exactly in tune with the resonator, while a soft resonator permits a wide range of fundamentals to pass through un-dampened but adds its own frequency as on overtone, harmonic or inharmonic as the case may be.\"\n\nHardness carried to the extreme will result in a penetrating tone with a few very strong high partials. Softness carried to the extreme will result in a mushy, non-directional tone of little character. Between these two extremes lies a whole gamut of tonal possibilities.\nThe final factor to be mentioned is the effect of joining two or more resonators together. In general, the effect of joining two or more resonators is that the resonant frequency of each is lowered in different proportions according to their capacities, their orifices, and so forth. The rules governing combined resonators apply to the human voice: for the throat, mouth and sometimes the nose all function in this manner.\n\nThere are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.\n\nThe chest is not an effective resonator, despite numerous voice books and teachers referring to “chest resonance”. Although strong vibratory sensations may be experienced in the upper chest, it can make no significant contribution to the resonance system of the voice, simply by virtue of its structure and location. The chest is mostly connected to the upstream structures of the airways, such as the lungs and trachea (e.g. under the vocal folds). There, it has a high degree of vibrational absorption, with little or no acoustical function to reflect sound waves back toward the larynx.\n\nThe tracheal tree makes no significant contribution to the resonance system except for a negative effect around its resonant frequency. The trachea and the bronchial tubes combine to form an inverted Y-shaped structure known as the tracheal tree. It lies just below the larynx, and, unlike the interior of the lungs, has a definite tubular shape and comparatively hard surfaces. The response of the tracheal tree is the same for all pitches except for its own resonant frequency. When this resonant frequency is reached, the response of the subglottic tube is to act as an acoustical impedance or interference which tends to upset the phonatory function of the larynx. Research has placed the resonant frequency of the subglottal system or tracheal tree around the E-flat above \"middle C\" for both men and women, varying somewhat with the size of the individual.\n\nDue to its small size, the larynx acts as a resonator only for high frequencies. Research indicates that one of the desirable attributes of good vocal tone is a prominent overtone lying between 2800 and 3200 hertz, with male voices nearer the lower limit and female voices nearer the upper. This attribute is identified as brilliance, or more frequently as \"ring\" or the \"singer's formant\", as fully described by Sundberg. There are several areas in or adjacent to the larynx which might resonate such a high pitch. Among them are the collar of the larynx, the ventricles of Morgani, the vallecula, and the pyriform sinuses. The larynx is not under conscious control, but whatever produces \"ring\" can be encouraged indirectly by awareness on the part of the student and the teacher of the sounds which contain it.\n\nThe pharynx is the most important resonator by virtue of its position, size, and degree of adjustability. It is the first cavity of any size through which the product of the laryngeal vibrator passes; the other supraglottal cavities have to accept whatever the pharynx passes on to them. Greene states:\n\n\"The supraglottic resonators being in the main muscular and moveable structures must be voluntarily controlled to produce conditions of optimal resonance either by varying degrees of tension in their walls, or by alterations in the size of their orifices and cavities during the articulatory movements.\"\n\nThe oral cavity is the second most effective resonator.\n\nThe nasal cavity is the third most effective resonator.\n\nIn spite of being traditionally referred to, by many singers and teachers, as resonators, the sinuses consist of small closed air pockets, not acoustically connected to the vocal tract, and with no proven role in voice resonance. One could argue that head surface and deeper nerves close to the sinuses may detect passive vibrations entailed by the voice generated and transmitted across the vocal tract. These sensations might support the preservation of the image of the sinuses as effective resonators.\n"}

Vācaspati Miśra was a prolific scholar and his writings are extensive, including bhasya (commentaries) on key texts of almost every 9th-century school of Hindu philosophy with notes on non-Hindu or \"nāstika\" traditions such as Buddhism and Carvaka. He also wrote one non-commentary, \"Tattvabindu,\" or \"Drop of Truth\", which focuses on Mīmāṃsā theories of sentence meaning. Some of his works are lost to history or yet to be found.\n\nLittle is known about Vācaspati Miśra's life, and the earliest text that has been dated with certainty is from 840 CE, and he was at least one generation younger than Adi Śaṅkara. However, an alternate date for the same text may be 976 CE, according to some scholars, a confusion that is based on whether Hindu Śaka or Vikrama era calendar is used for the dating purposes. His scholarship is revered in the Hindu tradition, which believes that he was a Maithila Brahmin from Andhra Tharhi \nBihar.\n\n\"Tattvabindu\" is his original work, wherein he develops principles of hermeneutics, and discusses the \"Theory of Meaning\" for the Mīmāṃsā school of Hindu philosophy. This is an influential work, and attempted to resolve some of the interpretation disputes on classical Sanskrit texts.\n\nVācaspati examines five competing theories of linguistic meaning:\nVācaspati concurs with the Bhāṭṭa view, when he employs in other contexts, such as the Nyāya sub-commentary, the \"Nyāya-vārttika-tātparya-ṭīkā,\" and the Tattva-vaiśāradī.\n\nVācaspati Miśra is credited with influential commentaries such as \"Tattvakaumudi\" on Sāṃkhyakārika, \"Nyāyasucinibandha\" on Nyāya-sūtras, various important texts of Advaita Vedānta, \"Nyāyakānika\" (an Advaita work on science of reason), \"Tattvasamikṣa\" (lost work), \"Nyāya-vārttika-tātparyaṭīkā\" (a subcommentary on the \"Nyāya-sūtras\"), \"Tattva-vaiśāradī\" on Yogasūtra, and others.\n\nWhile some known works of Vācaspati Miśra are now lost, others exist in numerous numbers. Over ninety medieval era manuscripts, for example, in different parts of India have been found of his \"Tattvakaumudi\", which literally means \"Moonlight on the Truth\". This suggests that his work was sought and influential. A critical edition of \"Tattvakaumudi\" was published by Srinivasan in 1967.\n\n\n\n"}
