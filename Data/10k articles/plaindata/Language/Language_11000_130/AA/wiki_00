The decree is difficult to date but it followed the revolt of the cities of Euboea in 446. The islanders were angered by the increasingly harsh imperialism of Athens and attempted to take advantage of the defeat of Athens in the Battle of Coronea in neighbouring Boeotia (c. 447 BC) which resulted in the loss of the Athenian “land empire”. The revolt was crushed by the Athenians led by Pericles. Other cities on Euboea, such as Eretria, had decrees with exactly the same provisions passed. The decree is considered a point at which there was no longer any doubt of the imperial power held by Athens over its allies in the Delian League. \n\n\"I will not revolt from the people of Athens by any means or device whatsoever, neither in word or in deed, nor will I obey anyone who does revolt, and if anyone revolts I will denounce him to the Athenians.\" and \"I will be the best and fairest ally I am able to be and will help and defend the Athenian people, in the event of anyone wronging the Athenians people, and I will obey the Athenian people.\" \n\nAthens also expected to be involved in the judicial proceedings of the city of Chalcis resulting in the actions of local courts being severely restricted. The decree allowed the people of Chalcis to punish their own citizens, except in cases that involved death, exile, or the loss of rights as citizens. The right of appeal to the Heliaia in Athens was allowed. This was largely aimed at the oligarchic wealthy who hoped to gain the assistance of Sparta or Persia in their revolts.\n"}

Typical examples involve multiple occurrences of the definite article or definiteness marking, such is found in (but not limited to) the languages listed below. The structure of such phrases is widely discussed and there is not one conclusive analysis. Because of this, the example languages below each show unique structure where different proposed analyses have been used.\n\nResearchers have found when a language shows ellipsis within a Determiner phrase, and in particular those with adjective phrases, determiner spreading does not occur. Due to this, we do not find determiner spreading in languages such as Romance Languages as well as English .\n\nDeterminer spreading is found in Albanian where two definite articles are used for just one referent \"boy\" . As shown in (1) and (2), the ordering of the noun and the adjective does not matter, as long as the determiner falls before the adjective.\n\nIn Albanian, either of these sentence constructions in (1) and (2) are grammatical to mean \"the good boy\". In both of the sentences the determiner \"i\" marks the referent \"boy\". It is noted that the determiner \"i\" is a morphological entity to mark the adjectival class rather than definiteness of the noun, as is found in Greek below .\n\nIn Modern Greek, determiner spreading is not obligatory, and it contrasts with a non-spreading example in (3):\n\n(3) \n\nThe sentence above has an ambiguous meaning explained by the last two lines in the sentence above in (3). Both the meanings (i) and (ii) are grammatical with non-determiner spreading. However when DS is introduced, the sentence no longer takes on an ambiguous meaning.\nDeterminer spreading in the example in (4) has eliminated the ambiguity, rendering the second meaning in (ii) to be ungrammatical.\n\n(4) \n\nThe question that is being posed in (5) requires an answer to differentiate which kind of pen, silver or gold. The response in (6) shows determiner spreading occurring because the adjective is a \"restrictive modifier\" .\n\nResearchers believe that determiner spreading only occurs when the phrase has an \"intersective reading\" . Meaning that the focus of the sentence is the kind of pen rather than the pen itself. The determiner spreading is syntactically how a speaker can give stress to a phrase in Modern Greek. It has been suggested that the same result of focus on the type of pen can be acquired semantically by giving focus to the adjective, as marked by capital letters in (7).\n\nA commonality between the Greek examples we have seen thus far is that determiner spreading is obligatorily definite Article (grammar) in Greek. Another language specific observation is that the determiner precedes the adjective. Researchers suggest that in order for an adjective to appear post-nominally, the determiner must precede the adjective to be grammatical in Greek. The examples below in (8) and (9) reinforce this observation showing (8) to be ungrammatical where \"meghalo\" follows \"spiti\" with no determiner intervening.\n\nAn alternative structure to the tree above (see \"the silver pen\" tree), is shown to the right in \"the big house\". Researchers have described this structure as a predicative configuration in which the DP in SpecDP \"to spiti\" is acting as the subject of the higher DP .\n\nIn contrast with the optional DS in Greek, Swedish phrases that have an adjective show obligatory determiner spreading . Example (10) is marked as ungrammatical because it is monadic with respect to DS - there is only one determiner. By suffixing the noun with the determiner \"-en\" in example (11), the phrase becomes grammatical.\n\nOne proposed analysis of the structure of DS in Swedish suggests that \"den\"-support, is used to support definite DPs when D cannot be satisfied in any other way. It is used as a type of feature support for definiteness; when the definite noun carries stress, \"den\" is inserted for support to the DP. The determiner \"den\" and the determiner suffix \"-en\" are in complementary distribution. This proposed structure is shown in the syntactic tree to the right; where the \"den\" has already been inserted and the \"-en\" is experiencing downward movement to suffix the noun \"bil\" .\n\n\n\n\n\n9582.1993.tb00844.x\n\n"}

She studied Sanskrit and Buddhist literature and spent time in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh to study tribal life. She later returned to Mumbai as a researcher and wrote books in Marathi. She highly opposed Government during The Emergency (India) and was subsequently imprisoned. She also refused to accept literary honours like Padma Shree and Jnanapeeth.\n\nDurga Bhagwat was born in 1910 in a Karhade Brahmin family settled in the then princely state of Baroda. The veteran Sanskrit scholar and social activist Rajaram Shastri Bhagwat was the brother of her grandmother. Her sister Kamala Sohonie went on to become the first woman scientist of India. Her father was a scientist who discovered the procedure of making ghee from oil.\n\nDurgabai was attracted to Gandhism and took part in Indian freedom movement for a very short time. When she realised that she cannot do it for a longer time she left that and completed her studies from St. Xavier's College. But she continued to wear Khadi in that period. Her paternal aunt, Seetabai Bhagwat, had a great influence on Durgabai. Durgabai went to Madhya Pradesh for studying tribal culture where she had an idiosyncratic reaction to yam (Elephant foot) for which she was bed-ridden for six years. She could not complete her doctorate course.\n\nDurga Bhagwat was elected President of the 51st Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, held in Karad, in 1975. She was the second woman President of the Sammelan, after Kusumavati Deshpande since its inception in 1878. Durgabai publicly opposed the state of Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi and the arrest of Jaiprakash Narayan and was jailed by the government. After the emergency was lifted, she campaigned against the ruling Congress Party in the 1977 general election, and remained opposed to it for the rest of her life. After the Emergency, she was offered an influential government seat by the then ruling Janata Party which she declined. She decided not to accept any state-sponsored honours and declined the Dnyan Peeth Award.\n\nBefore chairing the Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, she was elected chairperson of the Tamasgir Meet and considered it a great honour.\n\nDurga Bhagwat never married. Her idols throughout her life had been Vyasa, Gautama Buddha, Adi Shankaracharya, American philosopher Henry David Thoreau, and Indian writer Shridhar Venkatesh Ketkar.\n\nDurga Bhagwat's notable works include a biography of Rajaram Shastri Bhagwat, \"Pais\", a collection of articles based around religions, their literature and practises and \"Vyas Parva\", a book about her study of Mahabharat. She studied religious literature, particularly Buddhist, works of Marathi saints from Dnyaneshwar to Tukaram, major Sanskrit works of Vyas and Adi Shankaracharya. Her book \"RRitu-chakra\", detailing the nature (particularly trees and flowers) in each Indian month, is perhaps her most famous work. During her prolonged recuperation after being food poisoned in Madhya Pradesh, she observed the changes in the nature over the 12-month cycle and spurred her to write articles on each season.\n\nBhagwat wrote many articles on cooking and crafts and was known as the 'Marathi Saraswatachi Sarswati'.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term subsequently came to denote object relationships with attachments to people or things in general persisting from childhood into adult life.\n\nIn \"Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality\" (1905), Freud distinguished the fixations of the libido on an incestuous object from a fixation upon a specific, partial \"aim\", such as voyeurism.\n\nFreud theorized that some humans may develop psychological fixation due to one or more of the following:\n\nAs Freud's thought developed, so did the range of possible 'fixation points' he saw as significant in producing particular neuroses. However, he continued to view fixation as \"the manifestation of very early linkages – linkages which it is hard to resolve – between instincts and impressions and the objects involved in those impressions\".\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy involved producing a new transference fixation in place of the old one. The new fixation – for example a father-transference onto the analyst – may be very different from the old, but will absorb its energies and enable them eventually to be released for non-fixated purposes.\n\n\nMelanie Klein saw fixation as inherently pathological – a blocking of potential sublimation by way of repression.\n\nErik H. Erikson distinguished fixation to zone – oral or anal, for example – from fixation to mode, such as taking in, as with his instance of the man who \"may eagerly absorb the 'milk of wisdom' where he once desired more tangible fluids from more sensuous containers\". Eric Berne, developed his insight further as part of transactional analysis, suggesting that \"particular games and scripts, and their accompanying physical symptoms, are based in appropriate zones and modes\".\n\nHeinz Kohut saw the grandiose self as a fixation upon a normal childhood stage; while other post-Freudians explored the role of fixation in aggression and criminality.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1927897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1927897", "title": "Grammatischer Wechsel", "text": "Grammatischer Wechsel\n\nIn historical linguistics, the German term (\"grammatical alternation\") refers to the effects of Verner's law when they are viewed synchronically within the paradigm of a Germanic verb.\n\nAccording to Grimm's law, the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) voiceless stops *p, *t, *k and *kʷ usually became Proto-Germanic *f, *θ (dental fricative), *x and *xʷ (velar fricative). Karl Verner identified the principle that these instead become the voiced consonants *b, *d, *g, *gʷ if they were word-internal and immediately preceded by an unaccented vowel in PIE. Furthermore, PIE *s, which usually came into Germanic unchanged, became *z in this position; Proto-Germanic *z later became North- and West Germanic *r.\n\nConsequently, five pairs of consonants emerged, each pair representing a single PIE phoneme. The following table shows the precise developments from Proto-Indo-European through Proto-Germanic and West Germanic to Old English, Old High German and Middle Dutch. It is mainly in the dentals that these languages show significant differences in the patterns of \". Note that this table lists only the outcome of word-internal consonants, since word-initial consonants were generally not affected by Verner's law.\n\nIn Old English, the fricatives took the voiced allophones , and when they were word-internal, and in Middle Dutch also when word-initial; see: Pronunciation of English ⟨th⟩. In Old High German, the stops were moved according to the High German consonant shift. In Dutch, the idiosyncrasies of this shift mean that Dutch (like German) experiences the shift þ→d but (like English) does not experience the shift d→t; thus the dental variety of \" is eliminated in Dutch by the normal operation of sound laws. Likewise, and merged in almost all Germanic languages (except Gothic and German), eliminating this variety early on. In Old Norse, and likewise merged altogether.\n\n\" is the phenomenon that a verb which in PIE had a stem ending in one of these phonemes displays a differing reflex in different parts of the paradigm, a result of the movable nature of accent in PIE. The Germanic past tense derives from the PIE perfect aspect, which was always athematic and therefore almost always had a shift of accent between the singular indicative (where it was on the root syllable) and the remaining forms including the past participle (where it was on the ending). However, the perfect aspect was only present in primary, underived verbs, and any derived verbs therefore lacked perfect forms altogether. These latter verbs formed the base of the Germanic weak verbs, and did not inherit the accent shift, so the alternation itself only affects Germanic strong verbs.\n\nA process of levelling has meant that there are only few examples of this in the modern languages. In East and North Germanic, this levelling was almost complete before the earliest records, though Gothic and Old Norse did have traces of \". In Old English, too, the levelling had already begun to the extent that in some verbs the preterite singular had taken the consonant of the preterite plural. The only surviving example in Modern English is \"was:were\", but a trace can also be seen in the adjective \"forlorn\", which reflects the old participle of the verb \"to lose\", or \"sodden\", which is originally a participle of \"seethe\". This latter is parallelled by German \"sieden, sott, gesotten\". German also features d:t in \"leiden, litt, gelitten\" (\"to suffer\") and \"schneiden, schnitt, geschnitten\" (\"to cut\"). One example of h:g is \"ziehen, zog, gezogen\" (\"to pull\"). All other cases have been levelled. Apart from the English copula mentioned above, the only occurrences of s:r in the modern languages are in Dutch: for example \"verliezen, verloor, verloren\" (\"to lose\") and \"verkiezen, verkoos, verkoren\" (\"to choose\").\n\nSome examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNB. Not all consonant apophony in Germanic verbs is caused by '. The consonant alternation in certain weak verbs which typically goes along with the ' phenomenon (\"think:thought\", German \"denken:dachte\") is a result of a later development in Germanic known as the Germanic spirant law. Likewise, the terminal devoicing which produces a fortis-lenis alternation in Dutch (\"wrijven:wreef\") is an unrelated historical phenomenon.\n\nIn PIE, causative verbs (meaning \"to cause to\") were derived from verb roots with a suffix *\"-éye-\", and the root vowel was changed to the \"o\"-grade. Verbs with this suffix eventually became part of the first weak class (*\"-jan\" verbs). This suffix always bore the accent, and the verb root never did, while in regular strong verbs the verb root was accented in the present tense. This caused Verner alternation between the original verbs and the causative verbs derived from them.\n\nExamples are numerous in the older languages but are less frequent today, because some levelling has occurred, and in some cases, one verb or the other was lost.\n\n\"heffen\" (\"to lift/raise\", from the strong verb *\"habjanan\") - \"hebben\" (\"to have\", from the weak verb *\"habjanan\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\" was originally applied to any pair of etymologically-related words that had different accent placement, including also Proto-Indo-European athematic nouns. The alternations in nouns were largely eliminated early on in Germanic, but a few cases exist of parallel forms being still preserved in different Germanic languages (such as English \"glass\" and Icelandic \"gler\", an example of the s-z alternation). No attested language, old or modern, shows any alternation in noun paradigms, however.\n"}
{"id": "2860790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2860790", "title": "Internal code", "text": "Internal code\n\nThe term internal code is a word-for-word translation of the Chinese term neima (內碼, 内码; pinyin: nèimă; jyutping: noi6 maa5). The term is primarily used by Chinese people.\n\nOriginally referring to the encoding used “internally” by a Chinese system, it refers to the encoding of a character in some character set, or to the character encoding being used. It is not an encoding in itself, and the actual encoding being referred to has to be determined by context.\n\nOn any computer system, the internal code is the native encoding being used. For example, in a Big5-based system (e.g., Microsoft Windows 3.1 localized for traditional Chinese), the internal code is Big5; similarly, in a GB-based system (e.g., DOS running CCDOS), the internal code would be GB2312. On early computers, the Chinese language card takes the internal codes and renders the corresponding Chinese characters on the screen . On many modern operating systems (such as all modern Microsoft Windows systems), the internal code is a form of Unicode.\n\nWithin a particular encoding, the internal code of a certain character simply means the value of the code point used to represent that character. For example, in the Big5 encoding, the character \"一\" (Chinese, lit. \"one\") has the internal code of A440 (hexadecimal); in the GB encoding, the same character has the internal code of D2BB.\n\nThe internal code can be used as an input method for inputting Han characters. This input method is usually called 內碼 in Chinese and is usually provided for Big5 and GB internal codes; in English, it may be variously called “neima”, “internal code”, “raw code”, or other similar names.\n\nFor example, in a Big5-based system, one can input the character 一 by typing “A440” using the “internal code” input method. On the other hand, in a GB-based system, to input the character one would itype “D2BB”.\n\nNeiMa expects the user to input the desired character by providing its value within the user-chosen character set.\n\nFor example, to input the Chinese character \"不\" (Pinyin \"bù\" - English \"not\") one can start the Neima editor, switch to Unicode character encoding mode and then type \"bù\"'s hexadecimal value within Unicode's table, which is 4E0D. \nNeiMa is a very awkward way of typing in characters, as a user would need to know the code points of all needed characters.\n\nMore generally speaking, NeiMa in Unicode mode accepts any code point within the Unicode table, so users are not limited to inputting Chinese characters, but also any other character that can be found within the Unicode table. For example, Latin Capital Letter A, A, may be inputted with NeiMa using A's Unicode code point, which is 0041.\n\nOn a Unicode-based system, one might be able to input a character by typing its Unicode number in hexadecimal. Such an input method might also be called “neima”, or it might be called “Unicode”.\n\nOn a JIS-based system (Japanese), there might be a \"kuten\" input method that allows characters to be input using a form of the internal code called the \"kuten form\"; this kind of input method is called \"quwei\" on GB-based systems (Chinese). Although the kuten (quwei) form is related to the internal code, such input methods are not usually referred as “internal code” input methods.\n\nThe use of an “internal code” input method to input characters would not be normally very practical. However, it is useful for inputting special symbols that may otherwise be impossible to input using other input methods. However, the user would need to have a table of characters with their internal codes.\n\n"}
{"id": "249001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249001", "title": "Inverted question and exclamation marks", "text": "Inverted question and exclamation marks\n\nInverted question marks (¿) and exclamation marks (Commonwealth English) or exclamation points (American English) (¡) are punctuation marks used to begin interrogative and exclamatory sentences (or clauses), respectively, in written Spanish and sometimes also in languages which have cultural ties with Spanish, such as in older standards of Galician (now it is optional and not recommended) and the Waray language. They can also be combined in several ways to express the combination of a question and surprise or disbelief. The initial marks are normally mirrored at the end of the sentence or clause by the common marks (?, !) used in most other languages. Unlike the ending marks, which are printed along the baseline of a sentence, the inverted marks (¿ and ¡) descend below the line.\n\nInverted marks were originally recommended by the \"Real Academia Española\" (Royal Spanish Academy) in 1754, and adopted gradually over the next century.\n\nOn computers, inverted marks are supported by various standards, including ISO-8859-1, Unicode, and HTML. They can be entered directly on keyboards designed for Spanish-speaking countries, or via alternative methods on other keyboards.\n\nThe inverted question mark (¿) is a punctuation mark written before the first letter of an interrogative sentence or clause to indicate that a question follows. It is a rotated form of the standard symbol \"?\" recognized by speakers of languages written with the Latin alphabet. In most languages, a single question mark is used, and only at the end of an interrogative sentence: \"How old are you?\" This was once true of the Spanish language.\n\nThe inverted question mark was adopted long after the Real Academia's decision, published in the second edition of the (Orthography of the Castilian language) in 1754 recommending it as the symbol indicating the beginning of a question in written Spanish—e.g. (\"How old are you?\"). The Real Academia also ordered the same inverted-symbol system for statements of exclamation, using the symbols \"¡\" and \"!\". This helps to recognize questions and exclamations in long sentences. \"Do you like summer?\" and \"You like summer.\" are translated respectively as and (There is not always a difference between the wording of a yes–no question and the corresponding statement in Spanish.) These new rules were slowly adopted; there exist nineteenth-century books in which the writer does not use either opening symbol, neither the \"¡\" nor the \"¿\".\n\nIn sentences that are both declarative and interrogative, the clause that asks a question is isolated with the starting-symbol inverted question mark, for example: (\"If you cannot go with them, would you like to go with us?\")\n\nSome writers omit the inverted question mark in the case of a short unambiguous question such as: (\"Who comes?\"). This is the criterion in Catalan. Certain Catalan-language authorities, such as Joan Solà i Cortassa, insist that both the opening and closing question marks be used for clarity.\n\nSome Spanish-language writers, among them Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda (1904–1973), refuse to use the inverted question mark. It is common in Internet chat rooms and instant messaging now to use only the single \"?\" as an ending symbol for a question, since it saves typing time. Multiple closing symbols are used for emphasis: , instead of the standard (\"Why do you say that?\"). Some may also use the ending symbol for both beginning and ending, giving Given the informal setting, this might be unimportant; however, teachers see this as a problem, fearing and claiming that contemporary young people are inappropriately and incorrectly extending the practice to academic homework and essays. (See )\n\nIn 1668, John Wilkins proposed using the inverted exclamation mark \"¡\" as a symbol at the end of a sentence to denote irony. He was one of many, including Desiderius Erasmus, who felt there was a need for such a punctuation mark, but Wilkins' proposal, as was true of the other attempts, failed to take hold.\n\nAlthough it has now become rare, it is correct usage in Spanish to begin a sentence with an opening inverted exclamation mark (\"¡\") and end it with a question mark (\"?\"), or vice versa, for statements that are questions but also have a clear sense of exclamation or surprise such as: (\"Who do you think you are?!\"). Normally, four signs are used, always with one type in the outer side and the other in the inner side (nested) (', ')\n\nUnicode 5.1 also includes , which is an inverted version of the interrobang (also known as a \"gnaborretni\"), a nonstandard punctuation mark used to denote both excitement and a question in just one glyph.\n\n\"¡\" and \"¿\" are both located within the Unicode Common block, and are both inherited from ISO-8859-1. \"¡\" has Unicode code point U+00A1 (decimal entity reference codice_1) and HTML named entity reference codice_2. \"¿\" has Unicode code point U+00BF (decimal entity reference codice_3) and has HTML named entity reference codice_4. In both cases, the \"i\" in the named entity reference is an initialism for \"inverted\".\n\n\"¿\" is available in all keyboard layouts for Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nUsers of English (US) keyboards under Microsoft Windows can obtain the inverted question mark \"¿\" using the Alt code method by holding down the Alt key and pressing 0191 or any multiple of 256 + 168 on the number pad and the inverted exclamation mark \"¡\" with number pad code 0161 or 173. In Microsoft Word, the inverted question and exclamation marks can be typed by holding down the Ctrl, Alt, and shift keys while typing a normal question or exclamation mark, or by typing either mark at the start of the sentence whilst in the Spanish language mode.\n\nWindows users with a US keyboard layout are able to switch to the US-International layout. Among other changes, this converts the key to the right of the space bar into the (graphics) key. (The left Alt key remains unchanged.) When the right key is held down and other keys are pressed, the combination produces other characters not found on the standard US keyboard. For instance, the keystroke produces an inverted exclamation mark, while yields the inverted question marks.\n\nOn the macOS platform (or when using the \"US International\"/us-intl keyboard layout on Windows and Linux), \"¡\" and \"¿\" can be entered by pressing / and / respectively. With a compose key, for example, <LEFT SHIFT> + <RIGHT CTRL>, they can be entered by pressing the compose key and or twice.\nAnd for AZERTY keyboards, the shortcut is: fn + alt + ! (number 8).\n\nIn LaTeX documents, the \"¿\" is written as codice_5 (question mark, backtick) or codice_6, and \"¡\" as codice_7 (exclamation point, backtick) or codice_8. (This may require including \"\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\" at the top of the document.) XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX have full Unicode support, and literal ¿ and ¡ characters may be input.\n\nIn Windows, an inverted question mark is valid in a file or directory name, whereas the normal question mark is a reserved character which cannot be so used.\n\n\n"}

He has published numerous articles and books on ethics, politics, the philosophy of language, technique, Basque literature and philosophy in general.\n\nHe is member of \"Jakin\" and the director of \"Jakin irakurgaiak\", a publishing house which has published over 40 books under his management. He also collaborated with the \"Klasikoak\" publishing firm in the Basque translations of various philosophical works and was one of the founders of \"Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea\" (The Basque Summer University). He is currently a Professor of Modern Philosophy and a lecturer at Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (The University of the Basque Country). In 2010 he was awarded the title \"honorary academic\" by Euskaltzaindia (The Basque Language Academy).\n\nAzurmendi is an intellectual who studies the problem more than the solution. Azurmendi's essays cover modern European topics in great depth and knowledge. He has incorporated the philosophy and thinking of European thinkers, especially German ones. He often adopts a polemic tone.\n\nJoxe Azurmendi is, in the opinion of many, one of the most prolific and erudite thinkers in the Basque Country.\n\nJoxe Azurmendi studied philosophy and theology at The University of the Basque Country, Rome and Münster.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1960s he joined the cultural movement which grew up around the magazine \"Jakin\", and was in fact the director of the publication when it was prohibited for the first time by Franco's regime. He has collaborated closely and uninterruptedly with the magazine since its restoration. In that publication he has raised the problems of Basque society in the context of European thinkers. During the early 1970s he focused his attention on disseminating basic literature in the Basque language on subjects which were being hotly debated at the time in the Basque Country: nationhood, socialism, internationalism, etc. In the 1980s he began teaching at The University of the Basque Country, and in 1984 he submitted his thesis on Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta, the founder of the Mondragon cooperative movement, in which he argued that Arizmendiarrieta's project aimed to unite individuals and society under an organisation which combined both socialism and French personalism.\n\nIn 1992 he published what was to become his best-known work: \"Espainolak eta euskaldunak\" (The Spanish and the Basques). The work, published by Elkar, was written in response to a text by Sánchez-Albornoz which claimed that \"The Basques are the last people to be civilised in Spain; they have a thousand years less civilisation than any other people ... They are rough, simple people who nevertheless consider themselves to be the children of God and the heirs to his glory. But they are really nothing more than un-Romanised Spaniards.\" Azurmendi's essay refuted and dismantled the stereotypes maintained about the Basques by certain Spanish intellectuals.\n\nIt was on the threshold of the new millennium, however, that Azurmendi's work reached its height. During the early years of the 21st century he published the trilogy formed by \"Espainiaren arimaz\" (About the soul of Spain) (2006, Elkar), \"Humboldt. Hizkuntza eta pentsamendua\" (Humboldt. Language and Thought) (2007, UEU) and \"Volksgeist. Herri gogoa\" (Volksgeist. National Character) (2008, Elkar). In this trilogy, Joxe Azurmendi reveals some of his most significant thinking.\n\nHis work emerged and developed during a period marked by a crisis of culture, politics and values. But it was a crisis that he understood not as something negative, but rather something that opened up a whole new range of possibilities. Consequently, all his thinking is centred around the defence of freedom in every field, but especially in relation to conscience and thinking.\n\nFar from fleeing the crisis, then, his work tries to outline how we can live in this situation. To this end, he adopts a relativist perspective, and given that modernity has left us with no solid base, he fights against the last vestiges of the dogmatism towards which our society tends to lean when in crisis:\n\nIn this sense, for example, he is critical of the modern state, which he accuses of being the new church seeking to control our consciences. He also criticises the exploitation of morality, or in other words, how politicians, instead of solving the problems facing them in their various areas or fields, flee instead to moral ground in order to hide their responsibilities under the cloak of supposedly absolute moral principles:\nHe has also made an important contribution in questioning the canonical interpretations which have been constructed regarding different issues. Of particular interest, due to his erudition and training in Germany, is his interpretation of the German Enlightenment. In this context he deconstructs the apparent opposition between the French Enlightenment and German Romanticism and proposes a new way of thinking about the different aspects which stem from this opposition. In this way, he defies certain Spanish and French intellectuals (Alain Finkielkraut) and argues that nationalism in fact arose in France (Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Ernest Renan) and was later reinterpreted by the German thinkers and romantics. By doing this, he questions the way in which authors such as Goethe, Schiller, Herder or Humboldt are viewed as the fathers of metaphysical nationalism. In this field, the opposition between civic nationalism and ethnic nationalism is deconstructed. Thus, Azurmendi criticizes the essentialist basis of Spanish nationalism and French nationalism that operates under these nation states.\n\nSome of the topics Azurmendi deeply develops in his essays first appeared in his poetry of youth. Azurmendi is within the Basque poetry of the 60s which shows the fight against the tradition, the old faith and the dogmatic certainties:\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">\nBut we wish to be free\nis that my fault?\nThey tried to give us a tree from Gernika,\na false blank check,\nas if the desire to be free were a sin,\nbut despite that, we, quite simply, wish to be free.\nThat is what we want, that is all.\nThis is the latest deception:\nthey have led us to believe\nbefore from outside and now from within\nthat it is our responsibility to justify our wish to be free.\n\n\"Manifestu atzeratua\" (Belated Manifesto) (1968)\n</poem>\n\nHe also dedicates a large part of his work to recovering and reinterpreting Basque thinkers, breaking through and dismantling numerous stereotypes. Of particular interest is his research into Jon Mirande, Orixe, Unamuno and others. He is an author who has worked from within and for Basque culture. He claims to have been influenced by Basque authors from the post-war period, for example, in questions of language. In this field, he has researched other authors also, including Heidegger, Wittgenstein, George Steiner and Humboldt. The fact that his vast oeuvre is all written in the Basque language is clearly consistent with his thinking.\n\nIn his language Joxe Azurmendi combines an educated register with colloquial expressions, and his prose is fast, incisive, and ironic. Azurmendi's Basque is modern and standard and he demonstrates great knowledge of the language, and richness and variety of expression.\n\n\nThe \"Inguma\" database of the Basque scientific community contains over 180 texts written by Azurmendi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Notwithstanding the biological time depth of the recessive mutation that causes deafness, the first substantial cohort of deaf signers did not occur until five generations ago, and this event marks the emergence of Kata Kolok (de Vos 2012). \n\nKata Kolok is unrelated to spoken Balinese and lacks certain contact sign phenomena that often arise when a sign language and an oral language are in close contact, such as fingerspelling and mouthing. It is also unrelated to other sign languages. It differs from other known sign languages in a number of respects: Signers make extensive use of cardinal directions and real-world locations to organize the signing space, and they do not use a metaphorical “time line” for time reference. Kata Kolok is the only known sign language which predominantly deploys the absolute Frame of Reference.\n\nDeaf people in the village express themselves using special cultural forms such as deaf dance and martial arts and occupy special ritual and social roles, including digging graves and maintaining water pipes. Deaf and hearing villagers alike share a belief in a deaf god. \n\nThe sign language has been acquired by at least five generations of deaf, native signers and features in all aspects of village life, including political, professional, educational, and religious settings. The Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (MPI) and the International Institute for Sign Languages and Deaf Studies have archived over 100 hours of Kata Kolok video data.

{"id": "43690276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43690276", "title": "MateCat", "text": "MateCat\n\nMateCat is a web-based computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool, of which there are several on the current market. MateCat is released as open source software under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) from the Free Software Foundation.\n\nMateCat, acronym of Machine Translation Enhanced Computer Assisted Translation, is a 3-year research project (11/2011-10/2014) funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement #287688. It has received already over €2,500,000 of European funds.\n\nThe project consortium is led by FBK (\"Fondazione Bruno Kessler\"), an international research center based in Trento, Italy.\n\nThe objective of MateCat is to create a tool to edit machine translation results and manage localization workflow. The system is able to learn from mistakes, automatically improve over time and specialize in field-specific language (for example, legal terminology) to provide the user the most accurate translation suggestions in a completely automatic and transparent manner.\n\nA TM is basically a repository of translated segments. During translation, the CAT tool queries the TM to search for exact or fuzzy matches of the current source segment. These matches are proposed to the user as translation suggestions. Once a segment is translated, its source and target texts are added to the TM for future queries. The integration of suggestions from an MT engine as a complement to TM matches is motivated by recent studies, which have shown that post-editing MT suggestions substantially improves the level of accuracy in translations.\n\nThe MateCat tool runs as a web-server accessible through Chrome. The CAT web-server connects with other services via open APIs: the TM server MyMemory, the commercial Google Translate (GT) MT server, and a list of Moses -based servers specified in a configuration file. While MyMemory’s and GT’s servers are always running and available, customized Moses servers have to be first installed and set-up. Communication with the Moses servers extends the GT API in order to support self-tuning, user-adaptive and informative MT functions. XLIFF is the file format natively supported by the open source version of the MateCat tool; however external file converters can be added in the MateCat configuration file. The tool supports Unicode (UTF-8) encoding, including non-Latin alphabets and right-to-left languages, and handles texts embedding mark-up tags.\n\nMateCat leverages the growing interest and expectations in statistical MT by advancing the state-of-the-art along three directions: Self-tuning MT, User adaptive MT, Informative MT.\n\nResearch along these three directions has converged into a new generation CAT software, which is both an enterprise level translation workbench as well as an advanced research platform for integrating new MT functions, running post-editing experiments and measuring user productivity. These include: i) an advanced API for the Moses Toolkit, customizable to languages and domains, ii) ease of use through a clean and intuitive web interface that enables the collaboration of multiple users on the same project, iii) concordances, terminology databases and support for customizable quality estimation components and iv) advanced logging functionalities.\n\nThe tool supports Moses-based servers able to provide an enhanced CAT-MT communication. In particular, the GT API is augmented with feedback information provided to the MT engine every time a segment is post-edited as well as enriched MT output, including confidence scores, word lattices, etc. The developed MT server supports multi-threading to serve multiple translators, handles text segments including tags and adapts from the post-edits performed by each user \n\nMateCat also provides suggestions by MT which are consistent with respect not only to the already edited segments but also, in theory, to the whole document. This context information will be embedded in the statistical models and should enable better disambiguation, for instance, between lexical alternatives. The context-based models will combine information about recurring terms and expressions extracted during the document analysis with the corresponding chosen and confirmed translations as soon as they become available. In particular, translation constraints related to inter-sentence and intra-sentence anaphoric expressions, to syntactic concordances, and to lexical coherence will be taken into account by means of specific statistical models.\n\nThe core components of traditional MT systems, that is, the translation and the language models, are generally static: they never change after an initial training phase. This means that they are unsuitable for a dynamic environment like the one that MateCat is designing for translators. In order to model the dynamic changes depicted in the two previous tasks, MateCat developed innovative data-structures that can be rapidly and effectively updated as soon as a new translation is supplied by the user, and innovative, efficient algorithms for performing this adaptation in such a way that the whole process takes place in real time and is transparent to the translator. Moreover, efficiency will be improved by taking advantage of single CPU multithreading, as well as distributed computing facilities running on private clusters or computer clouds.\n\nDuring post-editing the tool collects timing information for each segment, which is updated every time the segment is opened and closed. Moreover, for each segment, information is collected about the generated suggestions and the one that has actually been post-edited. This information is accessible at any time through a link in the Editing Page, named Editing Log. The Editing Log page (Figure 1) shows a summary of the overall editing performed so far on the project, such as the average translation speed and post-editing effort and the percentage of top suggestions coming from MT or the TM. Moreover, for each segment, sorted from the slowest to the fastest in terms of translation speed, detailed statistics about the performed edit operations are reported. This information, with even more details, can be also downloaded as a CSV file to perform a more detailed post-editing analysis. While the information shown in the Edit Log page is very useful to monitor progress of a translation project in real time, the CSV file is a fundamental source of information for detailed productivity analyses once the project is ended.\n\nMateCat has been exploited by the MateCat project to investigate new MT functions and to evaluate them in a real professional setting, in which translators have at their disposal all the sources of information they are used to working with. Moreover, taking advantage of its flexibility and ease of use, the tool has been recently exploited for data collection and education purposes (a course on CAT technology for students in translation studies). An initial version of the tool has also been leveraged by the CasmaCat project to create a workbench, particularly suitable for investigating advanced interaction modalities such as interactive MT, eye tracking, and handwritten input. Currently the tool is employed by the translation agency Translated.net for their internal translation projects and is being tested by several international companies, both language service providers and IT companies. This has made possible to collect continuous feedback from hundreds of translators, which besides helping us to improve the robustness of the tool is also influencing the way new MT functions will be integrated to supply the best help to the final user.\n"}

Providing what he saw as clinical proof of the reality of the death instinct in 1930, Federn reported on the self-destructive tendencies of severely melancholic patients as evidence of what he would later call inwardly-directed mortido.\n\nHowever, Freud himself favoured neither term – mortido or destrudo. This worked against either of them gaining widespread popularity in the psychoanalytic literature.\n\nEric Berne, who was a pupil of Federn's, made extensive use of the term mortido in his pre-transactional analysis study, \"The Mind in Action\" (1947). As he wrote in the Foreword to the third edition of 1967, \"the historical events of the last thirty years...become much clearer by introducing Paul Federn's concept of mortido\". \n\nBerne saw mortido as activating such forces as hate and cruelty, blinding anger and social hostilities; and considered that inwardly directed mortido underlay the phenomena of guilt and self-punishment, as well as their clinical exacerbations in the form of depression or melancholia.\n\nBerne saw sexual acts as gratifying mortido at the same time as libido; and recognised that on occasion the former becomes more important sexually than the latter, as in sadomasochism and destructive emotional relationships.\n\nBerne's concern with the role of mortido in individuals and groups, social formations and nations, arguably continued throughout all his later writings.\n\nJean Laplanche has explored repeatedly the question of mortido, and of how far a distinctive instinct of destruction can be identified in parallel to the forces of libido.\n\nThe importance for the individual of integrating mortido in their life, as opposed to splitting it off and disowning it, has been taken up by figures like Robert Bly in the men's movement.\n\nThe term has also been applied in contemporary expositions of the Cabbala.\n\n"}

{"id": "202353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202353", "title": "Proto-Germanic language", "text": "Proto-Germanic language\n\nProto-Germanic (abbreviated PGmc; also called Common Germanic) is the reconstructed proto-language of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages.\n\nProto-Germanic developed from pre-Proto-Germanic into three branches during the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era: West Germanic, East Germanic and North Germanic, which however remained in contact over a considerable time, especially the Ingvaeonic languages (including English), which arose from West Germanic dialects and remained in continued contact with North Germanic.\n\nA defining feature of Proto-Germanic is the completion of Grimm's law, a set of sound changes that occurred between its status as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European and its gradual divergence into a separate language. As it is probable that the development of this sound shift spanned a considerable time (several centuries), Proto-Germanic cannot adequately be reconstructed as a simple node in a tree model but rather represents a phase of development that may span close to a thousand years. The end of the Common Germanic period is reached with the beginning of the Migration Period in the fourth century.\n\nThe alternative term \"Germanic parent language\" may be used to include a larger scope of linguistic developments, spanning the Nordic Bronze Age and Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe (second to first millennia BC) to include \"Pre-Germanic\" (PreGmc), \"Early Proto Germanic\" (EPGmc) and \"Late Proto-Germanic\" (LPGmc). While Proto-Germanic refers only to the most recent reconstruction of the common ancestor of Germanic languages, the Germanic parent language refers to the entire journey that the dialect of Proto-Indo-European that would become Proto-Germanic underwent through the millennia.\n\nThe Proto-Germanic language is not directly attested by any coherent surviving texts; it has been reconstructed using the comparative method. Fragmentary direct attestation exists of (late) Common Germanic in early runic inscriptions (specifically the second-century AD Vimose inscriptions and the second-century BC Negau helmet inscription), and in Roman Empire era transcriptions of individual words (notably in Tacitus' \"Germania\", 90 CE).\n\nThe Proto-Germanic language developed in southern Scandinavia (Denmark, south Sweden and southern Norway), the \"Urheimat\" (original home) of the Germanic tribes. It is possible that Indo-European speakers first arrived in southern Scandinavia with the Corded Ware culture in the mid-3rd millennium BC, developing into the Nordic Bronze Age cultures by the early 2nd millennium BC. Proto-Germanic developed out of pre-Proto-Germanic during the Pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe. According to the Germanic substrate hypothesis, it may be influenced by non-Indo-European cultures, such as the Funnelbeaker culture, but the sound change in the Germanic languages known as Grimm's law points to a non-substratic development away from other branches of Indo-European. Proto-Germanic itself was likely spoken after 500 BC, and Proto-Norse from the 2nd century AD and later is still quite close to reconstructed Proto-Germanic, but other common innovations separating Germanic from Proto-Indo-European suggest a common history of pre-Proto-Germanic speakers throughout the Nordic Bronze Age.\n\nEarly Germanic expansion in the Pre-Roman Iron Age (5th to 1st centuries BC) placed Proto-Germanic speakers in contact with the Continental Celtic La Tène horizon.\n\nA number of Celtic loanwords in Proto-Germanic have been identified.\nBy the 1st century AD, Germanic expansion reached the Danube and the Upper Rhine in the south and the Germanic peoples first entered the historical record. At about the same time, extending east of the Vistula (Oksywie culture, Przeworsk culture), Germanic speakers came into contact with early Slavic cultures, as reflected in early Germanic loans in Proto-Slavic.\n\nBy the 3rd century, LPGmc speakers had expanded over significant distance, from the Rhine to the Dniepr spanning about . The period marks the breakup of Late Proto-Germanic and the beginning of the (historiographically-recorded) Germanic migrations. The first coherent text recorded in a Germanic language is the Gothic Bible, written in the later 4th century in the language of the Thervingi Gothic Christians, who had escaped persecution by moving from Scythia to Moesia in 348.\n\nThe earliest available coherent texts (conveying complete sentences, including verbs) in Proto-Norse begin in c. 400 in runic inscriptions (such as the Tune Runestone). The delineation of Late Common Germanic from Proto-Norse at about that time is largely a matter of convention. Early West Germanic text is available from the 5th century, beginning with the Frankish Bergakker inscription.\n\nThe evolution of Proto-Germanic from its ancestral forms, beginning with its ancestor Proto-Indo-European, began with the development of a separate common way of speech among some geographically nearby speakers of a prior language and ended with the dispersion of the proto-language speakers into distinct populations with mostly independent speech habits. Between the two points, many sound changes occurred.\n\nPhylogeny as applied to historical linguistics involves the evolutionary descent of languages. The phylogeny problem is the question of what specific tree, in the tree model of language evolution, best explains the paths of descent of all the members of a language family from a common language, or proto-language (at the root of the tree) to the attested languages (at the leaves of the tree). The Germanic languages form a tree with Proto-Germanic at its root that is a branch of the Indo-European tree, which in turn has Proto-Indo-European at its root. Borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the Germanic branch within Indo-European less clear than the positions of the other branches of Indo-European. In the course of the development of historical linguistics, various solutions have been proposed, none certain and all debatable.\n\nIn the evolutionary history of a language family, philologists consider a genetic \"tree model\" appropriate only if communities do not remain in effective contact as their languages diverge. Early Indo-European had limited contact between distinct lineages, and, uniquely, the Germanic subfamily exhibited a less treelike behaviour, as some of its characteristics were acquired from neighbours early in its evolution rather than from its direct ancestors. The internal diversification of West Germanic developed in an especially non-treelike manner.\n\nProto-Germanic is generally agreed to have begun about 500 BC. Its hypothetical ancestor between the end of Proto-Indo-European and 500 BC is termed Pre-Proto-Germanic. Whether it is to be included under a wider meaning of Proto-Germanic is a matter of usage.\n\nWinfred P. Lehmann regarded Jacob Grimm's \"First Germanic Sound Shift\", or Grimm's law, and Verner's law, (which pertained mainly to consonants and were considered for many decades to have generated Proto-Germanic) as pre-Proto-Germanic and held that the \"upper boundary\" was the fixing of the accent, or stress, on the root syllable of a word, typically on the first syllable. Proto-Indo-European had featured a moveable pitch-accent comprising \"an alternation of high and low tones\" as well as stress of position determined by a set of rules based on the lengths of a word's syllables.\n\nThe fixation of the stress led to sound changes in unstressed syllables. For Lehmann, the \"lower boundary\" was the dropping of final -a or -e in unstressed syllables; for example, post-PIE \"*wóyd-e\" > Gothic \"wait\", \"knows\". Antonsen agreed with Lehmann about the upper boundary but later found runic evidence that the -a was not dropped: \"ékwakraz … wraita\", \"I, Wakraz, … wrote (this)\". He says: \"We must therefore search for a new lower boundary for Proto-Germanic.\"\n\nAntonsen's own scheme divides Proto-Germanic into an early stage and a late stage. The early stage includes the stress fixation and resulting \"spontaneous vowel-shifts\" while the late stage is defined by ten complex rules governing changes of both vowels and consonants.\nBy 250 BC Proto-Germanic had branched into five groups of Germanic: two each in the West and the North and one in the East.\n\nThe following changes are known or presumed to have occurred in the history of Proto-Germanic in the wider sense from the end of Proto-Indo-European up to the point that Proto-Germanic began to break into mutually unintelligible dialects. The changes are listed roughly in chronological order, with changes that operate on the outcome of earlier ones appearing later in the list. The stages distinguished and the changes associated with each stage rely heavily on . Ringe in turn summarizes standard concepts and terminology.\n\nThis stage began with the separation of a distinct speech, perhaps while it was still forming part of the Proto-Indo-European dialect continuum. It contained many innovations that were shared with other Indo-European branches to various degrees, probably through areal contacts, and mutual intelligibility with other dialects would have remained for some time. It was nevertheless on its own path, whether dialect or language.\n\nThis stage began its evolution as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European that had lost its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels as well as one or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, but it would have been strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.\n\nBy this stage, Germanic had emerged as a distinctive branch and had undergone many of the sound changes that would make its later descendants recognisable as Germanic languages. It had shifted its consonant inventory from a system that was rich in plosives to one containing primarily fricatives, had lost the PIE mobile pitch accent for a predictable stress accent, and had merged two of its vowels. The stress accent had already begun to cause the erosion of unstressed syllables, which would continue in its descendants. The final stage of the language included the remaining development until the breakup into dialects and, most notably, featured the development of nasal vowels and the start of umlaut, another characteristic Germanic feature.\n\nLoans into Proto-Germanic from other (known) languages or from Proto-Germanic into other languages can be dated relative to each other by which Germanic sound laws have acted on them. Since the dates of borrowings and sound laws are not precisely known, it is not possible to use loans to establish absolute or calendar chronology.\n\nMost loans from Celtic appear to have been made before or during the Germanic Sound Shift. For instance, one specimen *\"rīks\" 'ruler' was borrowed from Celtic *\"rīxs\" 'king' (stem *\"rīg-\"), with \"g\" → \"k\". It is clearly not native because PIE *\"ē\" → \"ī\" is typical of not Germanic but Celtic languages. Another is *\"walhaz\" \"foreigner; Celt\" from the Celtic tribal name \"Volcae\" with \"k\" → \"h\" and \"o\" → \"a\". Other likely Celtic loans include *\"ambahtaz\" 'servant', *\"brunjǭ\" 'mailshirt', *\"gīslaz\" 'hostage', *\"īsarną\" 'iron', *\"lēkijaz\" 'healer', *\"laudą\" 'lead', *\"Rīnaz\" 'Rhine', and *\"tūnaz, tūną\" 'fortified enclosure'. These loans would likely have been borrowed during the Celtic Hallstatt and early La Tène cultures when the Celts dominated central Europe, although the period spanned several centuries.\n\nFrom East Iranian came *\"hanapiz\" 'hemp' (compare Khotanese \"kaṃhā\", Ossetian \"gæn(æ)\" ‘flax’), *\"humalaz\", \"humalǭ\" 'hops' (compare Osset \"xumællæg\"), *\"keppǭ\" ~ \"skēpą\" 'sheep' (compare Pers \"čapiš\" 'yearling kid'), *\"kurtilaz\" 'tunic' (cf. Osset \"kəræt\" 'shirt'), *\"kutą\" 'cottage' (compare Pers \"kad\" 'house'), *\"paidō\" 'cloak', *\"paþaz\" 'path' (compare Avestan \"pantā\", gen. \"pathō\"), and *\"wurstwa\" 'work' (compare Av \"vərəštuua\"). The words could have been transmitted directly by the Scythians from the Ukraine plain, groups of whom entered Central Europe via the Danube and created the Vekerzug Culture in the Carpathian Basin (6th to 5th centuries BC), or by later contact with Sarmatians, who followed the same route. Unsure is *\"marhaz\" 'horse', which was either borrowed directly from Scytho-Sarmatian or through Celtic mediation.\n\nNumerous loanwords believed to have been borrowed from Proto-Germanic are known in the non-Germanic languages spoken in areas adjacent to the Germanic languages.\n\nThe heaviest influence has been on the Finnic languages, which have received hundreds of Proto-Germanic or pre-Proto-Germanic loanwords. Well-known examples include PGmc *\"druhtinaz\" 'warlord' (compare Finnish \"ruhtinas\"), *\"hrengaz\" (later *\"hringaz\") 'ring' (compare Finn \"rengas\", Estonian \"rõngas\"), *\"kuningaz\" 'king' (compare Finn \"kuningas\"), *\"lambaz\" 'lamb' (compare Finn \"lammas\"), *\"lunaz\" 'ransom' (compare Finn \"lunnas\").\n\nLoanwords into the Samic languages, Baltic languages and Slavic languages are also known.\n\nThe term substrate with reference to Proto-Germanic refers to lexical items and phonological elements that do not appear to be descended from Proto-Indo-European. The substrate theory postulates that the elements came from an earlier population that stayed amongst the Indo-Europeans and was influential enough to bring over some elements of its own language. The theory of a non-Indo-European substrate was first proposed by Sigmund Feist, who estimated that about a third of all Proto-Germanic lexical items came from the substrate.\n\nTheo Vennemann has hypothesized a Basque substrate and a Semitic superstrate in Germanic; however, his speculations, too, are generally rejected by specialists in the relevant fields.\n\nResearch in Germanic etymology continues, and many Germanic words whose origins were previously unclear or controversial now have plausible explanations in terms of reconstructed Indo-European words and morphology. Thus, the proportion of Germanic words without any plausible etymological explanation has decreased over time. Estimates of that proportion are typically outdated or inflated, as many of these proposals were unknown when scholars were compiling lists of unexplained Germanic words.\n\nThe following conventions are used in this article for transcribing Proto-Germanic reconstructed forms:\n\nThe table below lists the consonantal phonemes of Proto-Germanic classified by their reconstructed pronunciation. The slashes around the phonemes are omitted for clarity. When two phonemes appear in the same box, the first of each pair is voiceless, the second is voiced. Phones written in parentheses represent allophones and are not independent phonemes. For descriptions of the sounds and definitions of the terms, follow the links on the headings.\n\nNotes:\n\nGrimm's law as applied to pre-proto-Germanic is a chain shift of the original Indo-European plosives. Verner's Law explains a category of exceptions to Grimm's Law, where a voiced fricative appears where Grimm's Law predicts a voiceless fricative. The discrepancy is conditioned by the placement of the original Indo-European word accent.\n\n\"p\", \"t\", and \"k\" did not undergo Grimm's law after a fricative (such as \"s\") or after other plosives (which were shifted to fricatives by the Germanic spirant law); for example, where Latin (with the original \"t\") has \"stella\" \"star\" and \"octō\" \"eight\", Middle Dutch has \"ster\" and \"acht\" (with unshifted \"t\"). This original \"t\" merged with the shifted \"t\" from the voiced consonant; that is, most of the instances of /t/ came from either the original /t/ or the shifted /t/.\n\nVerner's law is usually reconstructed as following Grimm's law in time, and states that unvoiced fricatives: , , , are voiced when preceded by an unaccented syllable. The accent at the time of the change was the one inherited from Proto-Indo-European, which was free and could occur on any syllable. For example, PIE > PGmc. *\"brōþēr\" \"brother\" but PIE > PGmc. *\"mōdēr\" \"mother\". The voicing of some according to Verner's Law produced , a new phoneme. Sometime after Grimm's and Verner's law, Proto-Germanic lost its inherited contrastive accent, and all words became stressed on their root syllable. This was generally the first syllable unless a prefix was attached.\n\nThe loss of the Proto-Indo-European contrastive accent got rid of the conditioning environment for the consonant alternations created by Verner's law. Without this conditioning environment, the cause of the alternation was no longer obvious to native speakers. The alternations that had started as mere phonetic variants of sounds became increasingly grammatical in nature, leading to the grammatical alternations of sounds known as Grammatischer Wechsel. For a single word, the grammatical stem could display different consonants depending on its grammatical case or its tense. As a result of the complexity of this system, significant levelling of these sounds occurred throughout the Germanic period as well as in the later daughter languages. Already in Proto-Germanic, most alternations in nouns were leveled to have only one sound or the other consistently throughout all forms of a word, although some alternations were preserved, only to be levelled later in the daughters (but differently in each one). Alternations in noun and verb endings were also levelled, usually in favour of the voiced alternants in nouns, but a split remained in verbs where unsuffixed (strong) verbs received the voiced alternants while suffixed (weak) verbs had the voiceless alternants. Alternation between the present and past of strong verbs remained common and was not levelled in Proto-Germanic, and survives up to the present day in some Germanic languages.\n\nSome of the consonants that developed from the sound shifts are thought to have been pronounced in different ways (allophones) depending on the sounds around them. With regard to original or Trask says:\"The resulting or were reduced to and in word-initial position.\"\n\nMany of the consonants listed in the table could appear lengthened or prolonged under some circumstances, which is inferred from their appearing in some daughter languages as doubled letters. This phenomenon is termed gemination. Kraehenmann says:\"Then, Proto-Germanic already had long consonants … but they contrasted with short ones only word-medially. Moreover, they were not very frequent and occurred only intervocally almost exclusively after short vowels.\"\n\nThe voiced phonemes , , and are reconstructed with the pronunciation of stops in some environments and fricatives in others. The pattern of allophony is not completely clear, but generally is similar to the patterns of voiced obstruent allophones in languages such as Spanish. The voiced fricatives of Verner's Law (see above), which only occurred in non-word-initial positions, merged with the fricative allophones of , , and . Older accounts tended to suggest that the sounds were originally fricatives and later \"hardened\" into stops in some circumstances. However, Ringe notes that this belief was largely due to theory-internal considerations of older phonological theories, and in modern theories it is equally possible that the allophony was present from the beginning.\n\nEach of the three voiced phonemes , , and had a slightly different pattern of allophony from the others, but in general stops occurred in \"strong\" positions (word-initial and in clusters) while fricatives occurred in \"weak\" positions (post-vocalic). More specifically:\n\nNumerous additional changes affected the labiovelar consonants.\n\nKroonen (2011) posits a process of consonant mutation for Proto-Germanic, under the name \"consonant gradation\". (This is distinct from the consonant mutation processes occurring in the neighboring Samic and Finnic languages, also known as consonant gradation since the 19th century.) The Proto-Germanic consonant gradation is not directly attested in any of the Germanic dialects, but may nevertheless be reconstructed on the basis of certain dialectal discrepancies in root of the \"n\"-stems and the \"ōn\"-verbs.\n\nDiachronically, the rise of consonant gradation in Germanic can be explained by Kluge's law, by which geminates arose from stops followed by a nasal in a stressed syllable. Since this sound law only operated in part of the paradigms of the \"n\"-stems and \"ōn\"-verbs, it gave rise to an alternation of geminated and non-geminated consonants. However, there has been controversy about the validity of this law, with some linguists preferring to explain the development of geminate consonants with the idea of \"expressive gemination\". The origin of the Germanic geminate consonants is currently a disputed part of historical linguistics with no clear consensus at present.\n\nThe reconstruction of \"grading\" paradigms in Proto-Germanic explains root alternations such as Old English \"steorra\" 'star' < *\"sterran-\" vs. Old Frisian \"stera\" 'id.' < *\"steran-\" and Norwegian (dial.) \"guva\" 'to swing' < *\"gubōn-\" vs. Middle High German \"gupfen\" 'id.' < *\"guppōn-\" as generalizations of the original allomorphy. In the cases concerned, this would imply reconstructing an \"n\"-stem nom. *\"sterō\", gen. *\"sterraz\" < PIE *\"h₂stér-ōn\", *\"h₂ster-n-ós\" and an \"ōn\"-verb 3sg. *\"guppōþi\", 3pl. *\"gubunanþi\" < *\"gʱubʱ-néh₂-ti\", *\"gʱubʱ-nh₂-énti\".\n\nProto-Germanic had four short vowels, five or six long vowels, and at least one \"overlong\" or \"trimoric\" vowel. The exact phonetic quality of the vowels is uncertain.\n\nNotes:\n\n\nPIE \"ə\", \"a\", \"o\" merged into PGmc \"a\"; PIE \"ā\", \"ō\" merged into PGmc \"ō\". At the time of the merger, the vowels probably were and , or perhaps and . Their timbres then differentiated by raising (and perhaps rounding) the long vowel to . It is known that the raising of \"ā\" to \"ō\" can not have occurred earlier than the earliest contact between Proto-Germanic speakers and the Romans. This can be verified by the fact that Latin \"Rōmānī\" later emerges in Gothic as \"Rumoneis\" (that is, \"Rūmōnīs\"). It is explained by Ringe that at the time of borrowing, the vowel matching closest in sound to Latin \"ā\" was a Proto-Germanic \"ā\"-like vowel (which later became \"ō\"). And since Proto-Germanic therefore lacked a mid(-high) back vowel, the closest equivalent of Latin \"ō\" was Proto-Germanic \"ū\": \"Rōmānī\" > *\"Rūmānīz\" > *\"Rūmōnīz\" > Gothic \"Rumoneis\".\n\nA new \"ā\" was formed following the shift from \"ā\" to \"ō\" when intervocalic was lost in \"-aja-\" sequences. It was a rare phoneme, and occurred only in a handful of words, the most notable being the verbs of the third weak class. The agent noun suffix *\"-ārijaz\" (Modern English \"-er\") was likely borrowed from Latin around or shortly after this time.\n\nThe following diphthongs are known to have existed in Proto-Germanic:\n\nNote the change > before or in the same or following syllable. This removed (which became ) but created from earlier .\n\nDiphthongs in Proto-Germanic can also be analysed as sequences of a vowel plus an approximant, as was the case in Proto-Indo-European. This explains why was not lost in *\"niwjaz\" (\"new\"); the second element of the diphthong \"iu\" was still underlyingly a consonant and therefore the conditioning environment for the loss was not met. This is also confirmed by the fact that later in the West Germanic gemination, -\"wj\"- is geminated to -\"wwj\"- in parallel with the other consonants (except ).\n\nProto-Germanic had two overlong or trimoraic long vowels \"ô\" and \"ê\" , the latter mainly in adverbs (cf. *\"hwadrê\" ‘whereto, whither’). None of the documented languages still include such vowels. Their reconstruction is due to the comparative method, particularly as a way of explaining an otherwise unpredictable two-way split of reconstructed long \"ō\" in final syllables, which unexpectedly remained long in some morphemes but shows normal shortening in others.\n\nTrimoraic vowels generally occurred at morpheme boundaries where a bimoraic long vowel and a short vowel in hiatus contracted, especially after the loss of an intervening laryngeal (-\"VHV\"-). One example, without a laryngeal, includes the class II weak verbs (\"ō\"-stems) where a -\"j\"- was lost between vowels, so that -\"ōja\" → \"ōa\" → \"ô\" (cf. *\"salbōjaną\" → *\"salbôną\" → Gothic \"salbōn\" ‘to anoint’). However, the majority occurred in word-final syllables (inflectional endings) probably because in this position the vowel could not be resyllabified. Additionally, Germanic, like Balto-Slavic, lengthened bimoraic long vowels in absolute final position, perhaps to better conform to a word's prosodic template; e.g., PGmc *\"arô\" ‘eagle’ ← PIE *' just as Lith \"akmuõ\" ‘stone’, OSl \"kamy\" ← *\"aḱmō̃\" ← PIE *'. Contrast:\n\nBut vowels that were lengthened by laryngeals did not become overlong. Compare:\n\nTrimoraic vowels are distinguished from bimoraic vowels by their outcomes in attested Germanic languages: word-final trimoraic vowels remained long vowels while bimoraic vowels developed into short vowels. Older theories about the phenomenon claimed that long and overlong vowels were both long but differed in tone, i.e., \"ô\" and \"ê\" had a “circumflex” (rise-fall-rise) tone while \"ō\" and \"ē\" had an “acute” (rising) tone, much like the tones of modern Scandinavian languages, Baltic, and Ancient Greek, and asserted that this distinction was inherited from PIE. However, this view was abandoned since languages in general do not combine distinctive intonations on unstressed syllables with contrastive stress and vowel length. Modern theories have reinterpreted overlong vowels as having superheavy syllable weight (three moras) and therefore greater length than ordinary long vowels.\n\nBy the end of the Proto-Germanic period, word-final long vowels were shortened to short vowels. Following that, overlong vowels were shortened to regular long vowels in all positions, merging with originally long vowels except word-finally (because of the earlier shortening), so that they remained distinct in that position. This was a late dialectal development, because the end result was not the same in all Germanic languages: word-final \"ē\" shortened to \"a\" in East and West Germanic but to \"i\" in Old Norse, and word-final \"ō\" shortened to \"a\" in Gothic but to \"o\" (probably ) in early North and West Germanic, with a later raising to \"u\" (the 6th century Salic law still has \"maltho\" in late Frankish).\n\nThe shortened overlong vowels in final position developed as regular long vowels from that point on, including the lowering of \"ē\" to \"ā\" in North and West Germanic. The monophthongization of unstressed \"au\" in Northwest Germanic produced a phoneme which merged with this new word-final long \"ō\", while the monophthongization of unstressed \"ai\" produced a new \"ē\" which did not merge with original \"ē\", but rather with \"ē₂\", as it was not lowered to \"ā\". This split, combined with the asymmetric development in West Germanic, with \"ē\" lowering but \"ō\" raising, points to an early difference in the articulation height of the two vowels that was not present in North Germanic. It could be seen as evidence that the lowering of \"ē\" to \"ā\" began in West Germanic at a time when final vowels were still long, and spread to North Germanic through the late Germanic dialect continuum, but only reaching the latter after the vowels had already been shortened.\n\n\"ē₂\" is uncertain as a phoneme and only reconstructed from a small number of words; it is posited by the comparative method because whereas all provable instances of inherited (PIE) *\"ē\" (PGmc. *\"ē₁\") are distributed in Gothic as \"ē\" and the other Germanic languages as *\"ā\", all the Germanic languages agree on some occasions of \"ē\" (e.g., Goth/OE/ON \"hēr\" ‘here‘ ← late PGmc. *\"hē₂r\"). Gothic makes no orthographic and therefore presumably no phonetic distinction between \"ē₁\" and \"ē₂\", but the existence of two Proto-Germanic long \"e\"-like phonemes is supported by the existence of two \"e\"-like Elder Futhark runes, Ehwaz and Eihwaz.\n\nKrahe treats \"ē₂\" (secondary \"ē\") as identical with \"ī\". It probably continues PIE \"ēi\", and it may have been in the process of transition from a diphthong to a long simple vowel in the Proto-Germanic period. Lehmann lists the following origins for \"ē₂\":\n\nProto-Germanic developed nasal vowels from two sources. The earlier and much more frequent source was word-final \"-n\" (from PIE \"-n\" or \"-m\") in unstressed syllables, which at first gave rise to short \"-ą\", \"-į\", \"-ų\", long \"-į̄\", \"-ę̄\", \"-ą̄\", and overlong \"-ę̂\", \"-ą̂\". \"-ę̄\" and \"-ę̂\" then merged into \"-ą̄\" and \"-ą̂\", which later developed into \"-ǭ\" and \"-ǫ̂\". Another source, developing only in late Proto-Germanic times, was in the sequences \"-inh-\", \"-anh-\", \"-unh-\", in which the nasal consonant lost its occlusion and was converted into lengthening and nasalisation of the preceding vowel, becoming \"-ą̄h-\", \"-į̄h-\", \"-ų̄h-\" (still written as \"-anh-\", \"-inh-\", \"-unh-\" in this article).\n\nIn many cases, the nasality was not contrastive and was merely present as an additional surface articulation. No Germanic language that preserves the word-final vowels has their nasality preserved. Word-final short nasal vowels do not show different reflexes compared to non-nasal vowels. However, the comparative method does require a three-way phonemic distinction between word-final \"*-ō\", \"*-ǭ\" and \"*-ōn\", which each has a distinct pattern of reflexes in the later Germanic languages:\n\nThe distinct reflexes of nasal \"-ǭ\" versus non-nasal \"-ō\" are caused by the Northwest Germanic raising of final \"-ō\" to , which did not affect \"-ǭ\". When the vowels were shortened and denasalised, these two vowels no longer had the same place of articulation, and did not merge: \"-ō\" became (later ) while \"-ǭ\" became (later ). This allowed their reflexes to stay distinct.\n\nThe nasality of word-internal vowels (from \"-nh-\") was more stable, and survived into the early dialects intact.\n\nPhonemic nasal vowels definitely occurred in Proto-Norse and Old Norse. They were preserved in Old Icelandic down to at least 1125, the earliest possible time for the creation of the \"First Grammatical Treatise\", which documents nasal vowels. The PG nasal vowels from \"-nh-\" sequences were preserved in Old Icelandic as shown by examples given in the \"First Grammatical Treatise\". For example:\nThe phonemicity is evident from minimal pairs like \"ǿ̇ra\" \"younger\" vs. \"ǿra\" \"vex\" < \"*wor-\", cognate with English \"weary\". The inherited Proto-Germanic nasal vowels were joined in Old Norse by nasal vowels from other sources, e.g. loss of \"*n\" before \"s\". Modern Elfdalian still includes nasal vowels that directly derive from Old Norse, e.g. \"gą̊s\" \"goose\" < Old Norse \"gás\" (presumably nasalized, although not so written); cf. German \"Gans\", showing the original consonant.\n\nSimilar surface (possibly phonemic) nasal/non-nasal contrasts occurred in the West Germanic languages down through Proto-Anglo-Frisian of 400 or so. Proto-Germanic medial nasal vowels were inherited, but were joined by new nasal vowels resulting from the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, which extended the loss of nasal consonants (only before \"-h-\" in Proto-Germanic) to all environments before a fricative (thus including \"-mf-\", \"-nþ-\" and \"-ns-\" as well). The contrast between nasal and non-nasal long vowels is reflected in the differing output of nasalized long \"*ą̄\", which was raised to \"ō\" in Old English and Old Frisian whereas non-nasal \"*ā\" appeared as fronted \"ǣ\". Hence:\n\nProto-Germanic allowed the following clusters in initial and medial position:\n\nIt allowed the following clusters in medial position only:\n\nIt allowed the following clusters in medial and final position only:\n\nThe \"s\" + voiceless plosive clusters, \"sp\", \"st\", \"sk\", could appear in any position in a word.\n\nDue to the emergence of a word-initial stress accent, vowels in unstressed syllables were gradually reduced over time, beginning at the very end of the Proto-Germanic period and continuing into the history of the various dialects. Already in Proto-Germanic, word-final and had been lost, and had merged with in unstressed syllables. Vowels in third syllables were also generally lost before dialect diversification began, such as final \"-i\" of some present tense verb endings, and in \"-maz\" and \"-miz\" of the dative plural ending and 1st person plural present of verbs.\n\nWord-final short nasal vowels were however preserved longer, as is reflected Proto-Norse which still preserved word-final \"-ą\" (\"horna\" on the Gallehus horns), while the dative plural appears as \"-mz\" (\"gestumz\" on the Stentoften Runestone). Somewhat greater reduction is found in Gothic, which lost all final-syllable short vowels except \"u\". Old High German and Old English initially preserved unstressed \"i\" and \"u\", but later lost them in long-stemmed words and then Old High German lost them in many short-stemmed ones as well, by analogy.\n\nOld English shows indirect evidence that word-final \"-ą\" was preserved into the separate history of the language. This can be seen in the infinitive ending \"-an\" (< *\"aną\") and the strong past participle ending \"-en\" (< *\"-anaz\"). Since the early Old English fronting of to did not occur in nasalized vowels or before back vowels, this created a vowel alternation because the nasality of the back vowel \"ą\" in the infinitive ending prevented the fronting of the preceding vowel: *\"-aną\" > *\"-an\", but *\"-anaz\" > *\"-ænæ\" > *\"-en\". Therefore, the Anglo-Frisian brightening must necessarily have occurred very early in the history of the Anglo-Frisian languages, before the loss of final \"-ą\".\n\nThe outcome of final vowels and combinations in the various daughters is shown in the table below:\n\nNote that some Proto-Germanic endings have merged in all of the literary languages but are still distinct in runic Proto-Norse, e.g. \"*-īz\" vs. \"*-ijaz\" (\"þrijōz dohtrīz\" \"three daughters\" in the Tune stone vs. the name \"Holtijaz\" in the Gallehus horns).\n\nReconstructions are tentative and multiple versions with varying degrees of difference exist. All reconstructed forms are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\nIt is often asserted that the Germanic languages have a highly reduced system of inflections as compared with Greek, Latin, or Sanskrit. Although this is true to some extent, it is probably due more to the late time of attestation of Germanic than to any inherent \"simplicity\" of the Germanic languages. As an example, there are less than 500 years between the Gothic Gospels of 360 and the Old High German Tatian of 830, yet Old High German, despite being the most archaic of the West Germanic languages, is missing a large number of archaic features present in Gothic, including dual and passive markings on verbs, reduplication in Class VII strong verb past tenses, the vocative case, and second-position (Wackernagel's Law) clitics. Many more archaic features may have been lost between the Proto-Germanic of 200 BC or so and the attested Gothic language. Furthermore, Proto-Romance and Middle Indic of the fourth century AD—contemporaneous with Gothic—were significantly simpler than Latin and Sanskrit, respectively, and overall probably no more archaic than Gothic. In addition, some parts of the inflectional systems of Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit were innovations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European.\n\nProto-Germanic had six cases, three genders, three numbers, three moods (indicative, subjunctive (PIE optative), imperative), and two voices (active and passive (PIE middle)). This is quite similar to the state of Latin, Greek, and Middle Indic of AD 200.\n\nNouns and adjectives were declined in (at least) six cases: vocative, nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, genitive. The locative case had merged into the dative case, and the ablative may have merged with either the genitive, dative or instrumental cases. However, sparse remnants of the earlier locative and ablative cases are visible in a few pronominal and adverbial forms. Pronouns were declined similarly, although without a separate vocative form. The instrumental and vocative can be reconstructed only in the singular; the instrumental survives only in the West Germanic languages, and the vocative only in Gothic.\n\nVerbs and pronouns had three numbers: singular, dual, and plural. Although the pronominal dual survived into all the oldest languages, the verbal dual survived only into Gothic, and the (presumed) nominal and adjectival dual forms were lost before the oldest records. As in the Italic languages, it may have been lost before Proto-Germanic became a different branch at all.\n\nSeveral sound changes occurred in the history of Proto-Germanic that were triggered only in some environments but not in others. Some of these were grammaticalised while others were still triggered by phonetic rules and were partially allophonic or surface filters.\n\nProbably the most far-reaching alternation was between [*f, *þ, *s, *h, *hw] and [*b, *d, *z, *g, *gw], the voiceless and voiced fricatives, known as Grammatischer Wechsel and triggered by the earlier operation of Verner's law. It was found in various environments:\n\nAnother form of alternation was triggered by the Germanic spirant law, which continued to operate into the separate history of the individual daughter languages. It is found in environments with suffixal -t, including:\n\nAn alternation not triggered by sound change was Sievers' law, which caused alternation of suffixal -j- and -ij- depending on the length of the preceding part of the morpheme. If preceded within the same morpheme by only short vowel followed by a single consonant, -j- appeared. In all other cases, such as when preceded by a long vowel or diphthong, by two or more consonants, or by more than one syllable, -ij- appeared. The distinction between morphemes and words is important here, as the alternant -j- appeared also in words that contained a distinct suffix that in turn contained -j- in its second syllable. A notable example was the verb suffix *-atjaną, which retained -j- despite being preceded by two syllables in a fully formed word.\n\nRelated to the above was the alternation between -j- and -i-, and likewise between -ij- and -ī-. This was caused by the earlier loss of -j- before -i-, and appeared whenever an ending was attached to a verb or noun with an -(i)j- suffix (which were numerous). Similar, but much more rare, was an alternation between -aV- and -aiC- from the loss of -j- between two vowels, which appeared in the present subjunctive of verbs: *-aų < *-ajų in the first person, *-ai- in the others. A combination of these two effects created an alternation between -ā- and -ai- found in class 3 weak verbs, with -ā- < -aja- < -əja- and -ai- < -əi- < -əji-.\n\nI-mutation was the most important source of vowel alternation, and continued well into the history of the individual daughter languages (although it was either absent or not apparent in Gothic). In Proto-Germanic, only -e- was affected, which was raised by -i- or -j- in the following syllable. Examples are numerous:\n\nThe system of nominal declensions was largely inherited from PIE. Primary nominal declensions were the stems in /a/, /ō/, /n/, /i/, and /u/. The first three were particularly important and served as the basis of adjectival declension; there was a tendency for nouns of all other classes to be drawn into them. The first two had variants in /ja/ and /wa/, and /jō/ and /wō/, respectively; originally, these were declined exactly like other nouns of the respective class, but later sound changes tended to distinguish these variants as their own subclasses. The /n/ nouns had various subclasses, including /ōn/ (masculine and feminine), /an/ (neuter), and /īn/ (feminine, mostly abstract nouns). There was also a smaller class of root nouns (ending in various consonants), nouns of relationship (ending in /er/), and neuter nouns in /z/ (this class was greatly expanded in German). Present participles, and a few nouns, ended in /nd/. The neuter nouns of all classes differed from the masculines and feminines in their nominative and accusative endings, which were alike.\n\nAdjectives agree with the noun they qualify in case, number, and gender. Adjectives evolved into strong and weak declensions, originally with indefinite and definite meaning, respectively. As a result of its definite meaning, the weak form came to be used in the daughter languages in conjunction with demonstratives and definite articles. The terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" are based on the later development of these declensions in languages such as German and Old English, where the strong declensions have more distinct endings. In the proto-language, as in Gothic, such terms have no relevance. The strong declension was based on a combination of the nominal /a/ and /ō/ stems with the PIE pronominal endings; the weak declension was based on the nominal /n/ declension.\nProto-Germanic originally had two demonstratives (proximal *\"hi-\" ‘this’, distal *\"sa\"/\"sō\"/\"þat\" ‘that’) which could serve as both adjectives and pronouns, although the proximal was obsolescent in Gothic (e.g. Goth acc. \"hina\", dat. \"himma\", neut. \"hita\") and obsolete everywhere else. Ultimately, only the distal survived, evolved into the definite article, and underlies the English determiners \"the\" and \"that\". In the North-West Germanic languages (but not in Gothic), a new proximal demonstrative ('this' as opposed to 'that') evolved by appending \"-si\" to the distal demonstrative (e.g. Runic Norse nom.sg. \"sa-si\", gen. \"þes-si\", dat. \"þeim-si\"), with complex subsequent developments in the various daughter languages. The new demonstrative underlies the English determiners \"this\", \"these\" and \"those\". (Originally, \"these\", \"those\" were dialectal variants of the masculine plural of \"this\".)\n\nProto-Germanic had only two tenses (past and present), compared to 5-7 in Greek, Latin, Proto-Slavic and Sanskrit. Some of this difference is due to deflexion, featured by a loss of tenses present in Proto-Indo-European. For example, Donald Ringe assumes for Proto-Germanic an early loss of the PIE imperfect aspect (something that also occurred in most other branches), followed by merging of the aspectual categories present-aorist and the mood categories indicative-subjunctive. (This assumption allows him to account for cases where Proto-Germanic has present indicative verb forms that look like PIE aorist subjunctives.)\n\nHowever, many of the tenses of the other languages (e.g. future, future perfect, pluperfect, Latin imperfect) are not cognate with each other and represent separate innovations in each language. For example, the Greek future uses a \"-s-\" ending, apparently derived from a desiderative construction that in PIE was part of the system of derivational morphology (not the inflectional system); the Sanskrit future uses a \"-sy-\" ending, from a different desiderative verb construction and often with a different ablaut grade from Greek; while the Latin future uses endings derived either from the PIE subjunctive or from the PIE verb * \"to be\". Similarly, the Latin imperfect and pluperfect stem from Italic innovations and are not cognate with the corresponding Greek or Sanskrit forms; and while the Greek and Sanskrit pluperfect tenses appear cognate, there are no parallels in any other Indo-European languages, leading to the conclusion that this tense is either a shared Greek-Sanskrit innovation or separate, coincidental developments in the two languages. In this respect, Proto-Germanic can be said to be characterized by the failure to innovate new synthetic tenses as much as the loss of existing tenses. Later Germanic languages did innovate new tenses, derived through periphrastic constructions, with Modern English likely possessing the most elaborated tense system (\"Yes, the house will still be being built a month from now\"). On the other hand, even the past tense was later lost (or widely lost) in most High German dialects as well as in Afrikaans.\n\nVerbs in Proto-Germanic were divided into two main groups, called \"strong\" and \"weak\", according to the way the past tense is formed. Strong verbs use ablaut (i.e. a different vowel in the stem) and/or reduplication (derived primarily from the Proto-Indo-European perfect), while weak verbs use a dental suffix (now generally held to be a reflex of the reduplicated imperfect of PIE *\"dheH-\" originally \"put\", in Germanic \"do\"). Strong verbs were divided into seven main classes while weak verbs were divided into five main classes (although no attested language has more than four classes of weak verbs). Strong verbs generally have no suffix in the present tense, although some have a \"-j-\" suffix that is a direct continuation of the PIE \"-y-\" suffix, and a few have an \"-n-\" suffix or infix that continues the \"-n-\" infix of PIE. Almost all weak verbs have a present-tense suffix, which varies from class to class. An additional small, but very important, group of verbs formed their present tense from the PIE perfect (and their past tense like weak verbs); for this reason, they are known as preterite-present verbs. All three of the previously mentioned groups of verbs—strong, weak and preterite-present—are derived from PIE thematic verbs; an additional very small group derives from PIE athematic verbs, and one verb \"*wiljaną\" \"to want\" forms its present indicative from the PIE optative mood.\n\nProto-Germanic verbs have three moods: indicative, subjunctive and imperative. The subjunctive mood derives from the PIE optative mood. Indicative and subjunctive moods are fully conjugated throughout the present and past, while the imperative mood existed only in the present tense and lacked first-person forms. Proto-Germanic verbs have two voices, active and passive, the latter deriving from the PIE mediopassive voice. The Proto-Germanic passive existed only in the present tense (an inherited feature, as the PIE perfect had no mediopassive). On the evidence of Gothic—the only Germanic language with a reflex of the Proto-Germanic passive—the passive voice had a significantly reduced inflectional system, with a single form used for all persons of the dual and plural. Note that, although Old Norse (like modern Faroese and Icelandic) has an inflected mediopassive, it is not inherited from Proto-Germanic, but is an innovation formed by attaching the reflexive pronoun to the active voice.\n\nAlthough most Proto-Germanic strong verbs are formed directly from a verbal root, weak verbs are generally derived from an existing noun, verb or adjective (so-called denominal, deverbal and deadjectival verbs). For example, a significant subclass of Class I weak verbs are (deverbal) causative verbs. These are formed in a way that reflects a direct inheritance from the PIE causative class of verbs. PIE causatives were formed by adding an accented suffix \"-éi̯e/éi̯o\" to the \"o\"-grade of a non-derived verb. In Proto-Germanic, causatives are formed by adding a suffix \"-j/ij-\" (the reflex of PIE \"-éi̯e/éi̯o\") to the past-tense ablaut (mostly with the reflex of PIE \"o\"-grade) of a strong verb (the reflex of PIE non-derived verbs), with Verner's Law voicing applied (the reflex of the PIE accent on the \"-éi̯e/éi̯o\" suffix). Examples:\n\nAs in other Indo-European languages, a verb in Proto-Germanic could have a preverb attached to it, modifying its meaning (cf. e.g. \"*fra-werþaną\" \"to perish\", derived from \"*werþaną\" \"to become\"). In Proto-Germanic, the preverb was still a clitic that could be separated from the verb (as also in Gothic, as shown by the behavior of second-position clitics, e.g. \"diz-uh-þan-sat\" \"and then he seized\", with clitics \"uh\" \"and\" and \"þan\" \"then\" interpolated into \"dis-sat\" \"he seized\") rather than a bound morpheme that is permanently attached to the verb. At least in Gothic, preverbs could also be stacked one on top of the other (similar to Sanskrit, different from Latin), e.g. \"ga-ga-waírþjan\" \"to reconcile\".\n\nAn example verb: \"*nemaną\" \"to take\" (class 4 strong verb).\n\nAugust Schleicher wrote a fable in the PIE language he had just reconstructed, which though it has been updated a few times by others still bears his name. Below is a rendering of this fable into Proto-Germanic.\n\nThe first is a direct phonetic evolution of the PIE text. It does not take into account various idiomatic and grammatical shifts that occurred over the period. For example, the original text uses the imperfect tense, which disappeared in Proto-Germanic. The second version takes these differences into account, and is therefore closer to the language the Germanic people would have actually spoken.\n\n\"Proto-Germanic\", phonetic evolution from PIE only\n\n\"Proto-Germanic\", with contemporary grammar and vocabulary\n\n\"English\"\n\n\n\n"}

They were popularly used in advertising in Europe and North America into the 1970s. Examples of casual script types include Brush Script, Kaufmann and Mistral. Some may be non-connecting. \n\nScript typefaces place particular demands on printing technology if the letters are intended to join up and vary like handwriting. A typeface intended to mimic handwriting, such as Claude Garamond's grecs du roi typeface, will require many alternate characters. In digital type these (once drawn) can be substituted seamlessly through contextual ligature insertion in applications like InDesign, but this was complicated in metal. Another complexity in metal type was that sorts had to have delicate overhanging parts to interlock. This required careful design and casting for the sorts to fit together without gaps or the sorts breaking, or leaving gaps to be filled in by the natural spread of ink on paper.\n\nScript typefaces have evolved rapidly in the second half of the 20th century due to developments in technology and the end of widespread use of metal type. Historically, most signwriting on logos, displays and shop frontages did not use fonts but was rather custom-designed lettering created by signpainters and engravers. As phototypesetting and then computers have made printing text at a range of sizes far easier than in the metal type period, it has become increasingly common for businesses to use type for logos and signs rather than hand-drawn lettering. In addition, phototypesetting made overlap of characters relatively simple, something very complicated to achieve in metal type. Matthew Carter has cited his 1966 Snell Roundhand typeface as deliberately designed to replicate a style of calligraphy hard to simulate in metal. An additional development enabling more sophisticated script fonts has been the release of the OpenType format, which most fonts are now released in. This allows fonts to have a large character set, increasing the sophistication of design possible, and contextual insertion, in which characters that match one another are inserted into a document automatically, so fonts can convincingly mimic handwriting without the user having to choose the correct substitute characters manually. Many modern script typefaces emulate the styles of hand-drawn lettering from different historical periods.\n\nIn Unicode there is a script Latin alphabet for mathematical use, with both capital and small letters. Few fonts provide support for all 52 characters, and their presentations vary in style from roundhand to chancery hand and others. \n\nThese characters are listed here: \n\n\n\n"}

The official languages, under section 16, are English and French. Section 22 is specifically concerned with political rights relating to languages besides English and French.\n\nIt reads,\n\nSection 22 ensures that political rights regarding the use of other languages besides English and French are not limited by the fact that English and French are the only languages recognized as being official by the other provisions of the \"Charter\". The political rights regarding other languages may exist by virtue of statute or simply custom, and the rights may predate the \"Charter\" or may be created after its enactment in 1982. As author Walter Tarnopolsky noted in 1982, the Aboriginal peoples in Canada were the most likely people, and perhaps the only people, to have customary language rights. The section may allow other languages to become official languages in the future, and demonstrates that having constitutional law regarding languages does not mean the law is fixed forever.\n\nThat same year, Professor André Tremblay wrote that section 22 would apply to \"government services.\" He also points out that the \"Charter\" offers no assurances that these language rights \"will be provided indefinitely.\" If those rights are not constitutionalized, the government in question can presumably abolish them at any time.\n\nProfessor Leslie Green has argued that section 22 also justifies the English and French language rights. The rights regarding English and French in the \"Charter\" are special rights, which raises the question of whether such rights can be justified in a democracy. However, Green writes that the special rights can be justified if this \"leaves speakers of other languages no worse off than they would have been\" if the special rights for English and French did not exist. Green points to section 22 as evidence that other languages are not harmed by the rights regarding English and French. Indeed, the fact that the \"Charter\" allows for English and French to be used in the government does not harm other languages, because the numbers of English and French Canadians mean that those languages would be used in the government anyway. Still, Green acknowledged that \"tolerance\" of languages besides English and French could be improved. Justice Bastarache and fellow-experts also relate section 22 to upholding Canadian multiculturalism.\n\nIn 1982, Walter Tarnopolsky speculated that section 22, combined with section 27 of the Charter, which provides for a multicultural framework for Charter rights, could lead to the creation of new minority language education rights based on those in section 23 of the Charter, but for language groups besides the English and French-speaking populations. However, Tarnopolsky acknowledged that if any such rights are created, it would probably be done by elected governments, and not by the courts.\n\nWriting in 1982, constitutional scholar Peter Hogg remarked that section 22 would apply to rights in a \"particular area.\" Indeed, the governments of the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut allow Aboriginal languages to be spoken in their legislatures.\n\nHowever, debates regarding the use of different languages in the Parliament of Canada have involved discussion of section 22. In June 2005, a committee of Senators discussed whether speaking Inuktitut, an Inuit language, in Parliament would be constitutional. Concerns were raised about section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" and sections 16 and 17 of the \"Charter\", and how these sections only recognize English and French as the languages of Parliament. It was in turn argued section 22 was \"relevant\" to this debate, and that this section stated that the other Charter rights could not diminish rights regarding Inuktitut. Senator Serge Joyal, in expressing concern that \"12 Aboriginal languages will have disappeared\" in the year 2020 \"because people are not using them,\" argued that section 22 provided \"a foundation in the Constitution\" for a \"principle\" that could be invoked to guard against this. This senator argued that aboriginal languages, by custom, should have rights as to their usage.\n"}
{"id": "59107210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59107210", "title": "Standard Theory (Egyptology)", "text": "Standard Theory (Egyptology)\n\nIn Egyptology, the Standard Theory or Polotskyan Theory, sometimes abbreviated ST, is an approach to the verbal syntax of the Egyptian language originally developed by Hans Jakob Polotsky in which Egyptian verb forms are regarded as variously adjectival, substantival, or adverbial, with the possibility of ‘transposing’ any given verb phrase into any of these three classes. This analysis rests on the basis of systematically applying substitutional rules for syntactic nodes, whereby certain verb phrases are seen to be syntactically converted into noun phrases or adverb phrases because of the possibility of substituting such phrases in place of the verb phrase. This approach was widely adopted in the mid-20th century but eventually fell out of favor starting in the 1980s.\n\nThe Standard Theory has its roots in the study of Coptic, where in 1944 Hans Jakob Polotsky published a study, \"Études de syntaxe copte\", showing that the Coptic ‘Second Tense’ was consistently used in emphatic sentences, while the ‘First Tense’ was used in non-emphatic sentences. Polotsky extended this same finding to earlier Egyptian, showing that many uses of the ‘imperfective’ \"sḏm.f\" form of the Egyptian verb similarly corresponded to emphatic sentences, as did many uses of the \"sḏm.n.f\" form. In subsequent publications, Polotsky refined his observations into a new understanding of the Egyptian verbal system. The Standard Theory reached a broader reception in the 1960s, with some, such as Alan Gardiner, arguing against its conclusions. The theory was revised on a more linguistic basis during the 1970s, with further analyses using generative grammar. In 1976, Polotsky published \"Les transpositions du verbe en égyptien classique\", his most complete treatment of the theory as it applied to classical Egyptian. Polotsky’s ideas gained widespread acceptance, and in 1983, Egyptologist Leo Depuydt first gave them the name of ‘Standard Theory’.\n\nHowever, while scholars of Coptic and Late Egyptian firmly adopted Polotsky’s views, they eventually came to be questioned by scholars of Old and Middle Egyptian. The consensus surrounding the Standard Theory began to crumble at the 1986 Crossroad Conference on Egyptian Grammar. Heated debate emerged by the subsequent Crossroad II and Crossroad III conferences. Papers directly challenging some of the core assumptions of the Standard Theory began to appear, as Mark Collier and others cast doubt on the adverbial nature of certain verb forms.\n\nAs Egyptologists became increasingly aware of new developments in general linguistics and the idiosyncrasies of the Standard Theory in the 1980s, the theory was largely superseded by interpretations of Egyptian syntax in which verbal phrases often retain their full verbal character rather than undergoing ‘transpositions’ in almost all of their uses. More recent trends also pay greater attention to discourse phenomena and pragmatics in analyzing verb forms rather than following a narrowly structural approach. Though the name ‘Standard Theory’ is still commonly used, the theory itself has now largely fallen out of favor as modern Egyptologists have turned to these newer approaches, variously referred to as ‘verbalist’, ‘post-Polotskyan’, or the ‘Not-So-Standard Theory’. Nonetheless, a few scholars have continued to defend the ideas of the Standard Theory against their detractors, and many of Polotsky’s discoveries remain widely accepted.\n\nWhile there are many variants and further developments of the Standard Theory, the core of the analysis remains Polotsky’s treatment of the Egyptian verbal system. Polotsky categorized the various forms of the classical Egyptian verb on the basis of their syntactic substitutability with other kinds of phrases. In so doing, he arrived at three basic categories under which most of the verb forms could be classified:\n\nAdjectival verb forms:\n\nSubstantival verb forms:\n\nAdverbial verb forms:\nIn Polotsky’s analysis, the common particles \"jw\", \"wn.jn\", \"ꜥḥꜥ.n\", and \"m\" (this last with an attached suffix pronoun, e.g. \"m.k\", \"m.ṯn\", etc.) are seen as auxiliaries. Together with a following pronoun or noun, they form a substantival element that serves as the subject of a sentence, and they combine with following adverbial verb forms and constructions to form compound verb forms at the start of a syntactic sentence. These compound verb forms are considered ‘First Tense’ forms by analogy with the First Tense in Coptic grammar. The initial clause with a First Tense verb form can then be followed by either a string of coordinate clauses sharing the same auxiliary or by subordinate clauses with circumstantial or prospective verb forms.\n\nLike the First Tense forms, the Second Tenses are also analyzed as consisting of a substantival element as the subject followed by an adverbial element as the predicate. However, in this case the main verb is not part of the adverbial element but the substantival element, as an emphatic (substantival) verb form with a following suffix pronoun or noun. The Second Tense serves to highlight or emphasize the adverbial element by demoting the verb from predicate to subject, nominalizing it.\n\nAnother type of sentence, the so-called balanced sentence, is analyzed as two successive substantival elements containing emphatic verb forms, and can thus be seen as a special case of the Egyptian nominal sentence.\n\n"}

In the United States a \"stripper\" \"gas well\" is defined by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission as one that produces or less of gas per day at its maximum flow rate; the Internal Revenue Service, for tax purposes, uses a threshold of per day.\n\"Oil wells\" are generally classified as stripper wells when they produce 10-15 barrels per day or less for any twelve-month period.\n\nIn the United States in 2015, 11% of crude oil produced comes from a marginal oil well, and over 85 percent of the total number of U.S. oil wells are now classified as such. There are over 420,000 of these wells in the United States, and together they produce nearly of oil per day, 18 percent of U.S. production.\n\nAdditionally, as of 2006, there are more than 296,000 natural gas stripper wells in the lower 48 states. Together they account for over of natural gas, or about 9 percent of the natural gas produced in the lower 48 states. Stripper wells are more common in older oil and gas producing regions, most notably in Appalachia, Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nA stripper well may cost between $10 to $30 per barrel to operate, averaging $2,000 per month.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the regular tax rate is 7%, but may be 1% for marginal wells. In Michigan, stripper well tax is 4%. Other tax exemptions can be 15% of gross income. A 2005 tax credit for prices below $30/barrel was rarely in effect.\n\nMany of these wells are marginally economic and at risk of being prematurely abandoned. When world oil prices were in the low tens in the late 1990s, the oil that flowed from marginal wells often cost more to produce than the price it brought on the market. From 1994 to 2006, approximately 177,000 marginal wells were plugged and abandoned, representing a number equal to 42 percent of all operating wells in 2006, costing the U.S. more than $3.8 billion in lost oil revenue at the EIA 2004 average world oil price.\n\nWhen marginal wells are prematurely abandoned, significant quantities of oil remain behind. In most instances, the remaining reserves are not easily accessible when oil prices subsequently rise again: when marginal fields are abandoned, the surface infrastructure – the pumps, piping, storage vessels, and other processing equipment – is removed and the lease forfeited. Since much of this equipment was probably installed over many years, replacing it over a short period should oil prices jump upward is cost prohibitive. Oil prices would have to rise beyond their historic highs and remain at elevated levels for many years before there would be sufficient economic justification to bring many marginal fields back into production.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34033043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34033043", "title": "Transcription into Japanese", "text": "Transcription into Japanese\n\nIn contemporary Japanese writing, foreign-language loanwords and foreign names are normally written in the katakana script, which is one component of the Japanese writing system. As far as possible, sounds in the source language are matched to the nearest sounds in the Japanese language, and the result is transcribed using standard katakana characters, each of which represents one syllable (strictly mora). For example, \"America\" is written アメリカ (\"A-me-ri-ka\"). To accommodate various foreign-language sounds not present in Japanese, a system of extended katakana has also developed to augment standard katakana.\n\nKatakana, like the other Japanese kana, hiragana, has a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and characters. Therefore, once the \"Japanese sound\" of a word is established, there is no ambiguity in its katakana spelling (unlike spelling in English, for example).\n\nA much less common form of transcription, not covered in this article, uses kanji characters for their phonetic values. For information on this method see Ateji.\n\nBecause Japanese is written with kanji, the relative complexity of its characters means Japanese generally needs to be written larger than in English for legibility. Since Japanese characters encode one syllable at a time rather than one phoneme the amount of space taken tends to be the same, but challenges arise when Japanese encounters syllables and consonant clusters that the kana system isn't designed to handle. For example, the word smartphone is rendered in Japanese as スマートフォン (su-mā-to-fo-n). The syllable \"sma\" requires three characters to write down (スマー), which although the same amount as English, does not take up the same amount of horizontal space. Thus, the word is often shortened to スマホ.\n\nSince Japanese has few closed syllables, syllable-final consonants in the source language are often represented using the \"-u\" (or sometimes \"-o\" or \"-i\") kanas with implicitly silent vowels – though this vowel often is pronounced in Japanese – or the syllable coda is not represented at all. For example, the name \"Jim\" is written ジム (\"Ji-mu\"). A similar principle applies to consonant clusters; for example \"spring\" would be transcribed as スプリング (\"su-pu-ri-n-gu\").\n\nJapanese has only five native vowel sounds, each a pure vowel (monophthong) with a long and short form, and some degree of approximation is necessary when representing vowels from, for example, English. Diphthongs are represented by sequences of vowels, and pronounced with hiatus, as a sequence of discrete monophthongs, not a diphthong, as in ブラウン \"Bu-ra-u-n\" \"Brown\", ナイス \"na-i-su\" \"nice\", ディア \"di-a\" \"dear/deer\", レア \"re-a\" \"rare\". etc. The English spelling <ore> (phonologically /ɔː/ (RP) or /ɔːr/ (GA)) is usually \"diphthongized\" as \"o-a\" in Japanese (e.g. コア \"ko-a\" \"core\"), possibly because it is also pronounced as a diphthong (/oə/) in some accents of English. The English /eɪ/ is transcribed to either \"e-e\" (エース \"e-e-su\" \"ace\") or \"e-i\" (スペイン \"Su-pe-i-n\" \"Spain\"); similarly, /əʊ/ is transcribed to either \"o-o\" (ショー \"sho-o\" \"show\") or \"o-u\" (シャドウ \"sha-do-u\" \"shadow\").\n\nJapanese does not have separate \"l\" and \"r\" sounds, and \"l-\" is normally transcribed using the kana that are perceived as representing \"r-\". For example, \"London\" becomes ロンドン (\"Ro-n-do-n\"). Other sounds not present in Japanese may be converted to the nearest Japanese equivalent; for example, the name \"Smith\" is written スミス (\"Su-mi-su\"). Foreign sounds can be difficult to express in Japanese, resulting in spellings such as フルシチョフ \"Furushichofu\" (Khrushchev), アリー・ハーメネイー \"Arī Hāmeneī\" (Ali Khamenei) and イツハク・パールマン \"Itsuhaku Pāruman\" or イツァーク・パールマン \"Itsāku Pāruman\" (Itzhak Perlman).\n\nThe English voiceless labialized velar approximant /hw/ (orthographically \"wh\"), which is a distinct phoneme from /w/ in some varieties of English, can be transcribed as \"ho(w)-\". For example, \"White\" is ホワイト \"Howaito\", \"whale\" is ホエール \"hoēru\".\n\nFrench /w/ is typically transcribed as \"u\", but the sequence /wa/ is as \"o-(w)a\" (e.g. ポアロ \"Po-a-ro\" \"Poirot\").\n\nThe English /ti(ː)/ and /tɪ/ is typically transcribed to チ \"chi\" (e.g. チーム \"chīmu\" \"team\"), but ティ \"ti\" is also used (ティア \"tia\" \"tear\"). The suffix \"-tic\" can be transcribed to either チック \"-chikku\" or ティック \"-tikku\". However, \"-ty\" is almost always transcribed to ティ(ー) \"-ti(i)\", not *チ(ー) *\"-chi(i)\" (e.g. パーティー \"pātī\" \"party\", インフィニティ \"infiniti\" \"infinity\").\n\nThe English schwa /ə/ is variously \"transcribed\" to \"a\", \"e\", \"o\", depending on the English spelling (this is more of transliteration than it is transcription). For example, デュアル \"dyu-a-ru\" \"dual\", デュエル \"dyu-e-ru\" \"duel\", テスタメント \"Te-su-ta-me-n-to\" \"Testament\", ロンドン \"Ro-n-do-n\" \"London\". There are no definite rules when it comes to the schwa, however; e.g. ランダム \"ra-n-da-mu\" \"random\", オープン \"o-o-pu-n\" \"open\", ザ \"za\" \"the\". The British /ə/ which is equivalent to the North American /ɚ/ is transcribed to a(-a); e.g. コンピュータ(ー) ko-n-pyu-u-ta(-a) \"computer\", モーター \"mo-o-ta-a\" \"motor\". On the other hand, the French schwa is transcribed to \"u\" or \"o\" (e.g. ソムリエ \"so-mu-ri-e\" \"sommelier\", ド \"do\" \"de\") similarly to instances where there's a lack of vowels, and the German schwa is almost always transcribed to \"e\" (e.g. アルベルト \"A-ru-be-ru-to\" \"Albert\", ウンディーネ \"un-di-i-ne\" \"undine\").\n\nAlthough the diphthong /au/ across languages is usually transcribed as アウ \"a-u\", local reading transcriptions of the same sequence from Mandarin, represented in both Wade–Giles and Pinyin as \"ao\" are represented as アオ \"a-o\" instead, again in more of a manner of transliteration based on these systems - e.g. マオ・ツォートン \"ma-o tso-o-to-n\" (Mao Zedong).\n\nThe English /æ/ is typically transcribed to \"a\"; e.g. マン \"ma-n\" \"man\", チャネル \"cha-ne-ru\" \"channel\". The sequences /kæ/ and /ɡæ/ are sometimes transcribed to \"kya\" and \"gya\" respectively; e.g. キャンディ \"kyandi\" \"candy\", ギャラクシー \"gya-ra-ku-shi-i\" \"galaxy\".\n\nThe older English suffix \"-age\" /-ɪdʒ/ is always transcribed to \"-e-e-ji\" as if it were pronounced as /eɪdʒ/ as in \"age\" or \"rage\"; e.g. メッセージ \"me-s-se-e-ji\" \"message\", パッケージ \"pa-k-ke-e-ji\" \"package\". The more recent \"-age\" /-ɑːʒ/ is more \"properly\" transcribed to \"-a-a-ju\"; e.g. ミラージュ \"mi-ra-a-ju\" \"mirage\". However, \"garage\" /gəˈrɑːʒ/ is more commonly transcribed to ガレージ \"ga-re-e-ji\" as it also has /ˈgærɪdʒ/ as an alternative pronunciation in British English.\n\nThe phoneme /v/ in various languages is transcribed either to \"b\" or \"v\", although it is unknown whether there is such an equivalent phoneme /v/ in Japanese. For example, ベネチア \"Benechia\" / ヴェネツィア \"Ve-ne-tsi-a\" \"Venezia\" (Italian for \"Venice\"), オーバー \"o-o-ba-a\" \"over\", ラブ \"ra-bu\" / ラヴ \"ravu\" \"love\".\n\nThe German /v/ (orthographically \"w\") can be transcribed in several ways. In long-established words, it is generally \"w\". E.g.: \"Walküre\" \"valkyrie\" > ワルキューレ \"wa-ru-kyu-u-re\". In newer transcriptions, it can also be \"v\". E.g.: \"Schwestern\" \"sisters\" > シュヴェスタン \"shu-ve-su-tan\".\n\nAlthough several English dictionaries (Oxford's, Cambridge's, Longman's, etc.) do not endorse the notion of syllabic /m/, transcriptions into Japanese usually do; in other words, words with sequences /Cm/ (with C for \"consonant\") is transcribed as if /m/ is syllabic just like /n/ in \"seven\" (セブン \"sebun\"), /l/ in \"battle\" (バトル \"batoru\"). For example, リズム \"ri-zu-mu\" \"rhythm\", ファシズム \"fa-shi-zu-mu\" \"fascism\".\n\n\"Wa\" is usually written as ワ, although ウァ is sometimes used in transcriptions from Ancient Greek or Latin (e.g. ミネルウァ \"Mi-ne-ru-wa\" \"Minerva\").\n\nFrench vowels are usually phonemically transcribed, but non-phonemic stressed vowels (utterance-final) are sometimes also transcribed as long vowels. Compare the examples of メゾン \"me-zo-n\" \"maison\" and カレー \"ka-re-e\" \"Calais\", in which the same vowel /ɛ/ is transcribed as \"e\" and \"e-e\" depending on whether it is stressed or not. The French schwa is ignored altogether: words are usually transcribed as if there were no schwa at all. For example, the word \"le\" is transcribed as ル \"ru\", as is the single sound /l/ in \"cheval\" > シュヴァル \"shuvaru\".\n\nAlthough a syllable-final /n/ is typically transcribed using the moraic ン \"n\", ン is used in French to transcribe nasalized vowels, so French words with a final /n/ often use ヌ \"nu\" instead for distinction, e.g. マドレーヌ \"Ma-do-re-e-nu\" \"Madeleine\".\n\nPlain short consonants may be transcribed as geminated consonants to reflect the laxness of the preceding vowel, although this is not universal and there are plenty of exceptions. For example: English \"kick\" is キック \"ki-k-ku\" and \"castle\" is キャッスル \"kya-s-su-ru\", but \"extra\" is エクストラ \"e-ku-su-to-ra\" and \"battle\" is バトル \"ba-to-ru\". This practice expands to almost all English obstruents regardless of their voicing (/k/, /ɡ/, /s/, /z/, /f/, etc.), also to German/Scots /x/, occasionally to /n/ and /m/ (as pseudo-geminated consonant sequences /nn/ or /nm/). For example: English \"bag\" is バ(ッ)グ \"ba-(g)-gu\"; English \"Anna\" is アンナ \"A-n-na\"; English \"gamma\" is ガンマ \"ga-n-ma\"; English \"shuffle\" is シャッフル \"sha-f-fu-ru\"; German \"Mach\" is マッハ \"ma-h-ha\", \"Masoch\" is マゾッホ \"Ma-zo-h-ho\".\n\nGerman [x] is transcribed roughly as \"h-h\", accordingly to its preceding vowel, if it's not followed by a vowel (e.g. マッハ \"ma-h-ha\" \"Mach\", バッハ \"Ba-h-ha\" \"Bach\", マゾッホ \"Ma-zo-h-ho\" \"Masoch\"); [ç], its allophone occurring only after high vowels and consonants, are as \"h\" if not followed by a vowel (e.g. メルヘン \"me-ru-hen\" \"Märchen\"), or as \"hi\" if not (e.g. リヒター \"Ri-hi-ta-a\" \"Richter\"). Russian /x/ is transcribed as \"fu\" if not followed by a vowel (e.g. カザフスタン \"Ka-za-fu-su-ta-n\" \"Kazakhstan\"). Mandarin [ç] (in pinyin \"x(i)\") is transcribed as \"sh\" (e.g. シャオ \"shao\" from 小 \"xiǎo\" \"little\").\n\nGeminated consonants are typically transcribed consistently and faithfully, as gemination is also featured in Japanese. The only notable exceptions are /rr/ and /ɲɲ/, although /ll/ and /ʎʎ/ are still transcribed. Examples: is アッラーフ \"A-r-ra-a-fu\"; Italian \"Donatello\" is ドナテッロ \"Do-na-te-r-ro\"; Italian \"degli\" is デッリ \"de-r-ri\"; but Italian \"Verrocchio\" is simply ヴェロッキオ \"Ve-ro-k-ki-o\", not *\"Ve-r-ro-k-ki-o\". Italian /ɲɲ/ may be transcribed as the lengthened portion of the preceding vowel and a sequence of /nj/. For example, \"Sardegna\" is サルデーニャ \"Sa-ru-de-e-nya\".\n\nSimilar to the way speakers of English say Italian words, Japanese does not usually transcribe the Italian glide /j/ to reflect its true nature, but as /i/, perhaps for consistency and convenience. For example, \"Venezia\" is ヴェネツィア \"Ve-ne-tsi-a\", \"Sicilia\" is シチリア \"Shi-chi-ri-a\". Contemporary transcriptions of palatalized consonants from Slavic languages, however, are made using yōon, e.g.: Russian ピャチゴルスク \"Pya-chi-go-ru-su-ku\" (Pyatigorsk), Polish ビェルスコ＝ビャワ \"Bye-ru-su-ko=bya-wa\" (Bielsko-Biała).\n\nModern English compounds are usually transcribed in a way that reflects the independent pronunciations of the individual components. That is to say, there is no phonetic linking between components. For example, \"overall\" is transcribed as オーバーオール \"o-o-ba-a-o-o-ru\", not *\"o-o-ba-a-ro-o-ru\" as it is pronounced in English. However, there are a few exceptions, such as \"pineapple\", which is transcribed as パイナップル \"pa-i-na-p-pu-ru\", or \"double-u\", as ダブリュー \"da-bu-ryu-u\".\n\nLong vowels are generally written with ー to indicate lengthening, as in コーラ \"kōra\" (cola), rather than writing a distinct vowel ×コウラ *\"koura.\" There are two irregularities of note here. Firstly, lengthening of the final vowel may be ambiguous, and vary over time or between users. For example, in present Japan, \"computer\" is generally represented as コンピューター \"konpyūtā\" (long final), but in some cases, such as the computer industry, following Japanese Industrial Standards, it is represented as コンピュータ \"konpyūta\" (short final). Secondly, in modern Chinese loanwords, notably food names, in careful transcription diphthongs are represented by separate vowels, even if in Japanese they would appear to be a long vowel; this is particularly common with \"òu,\" especially in 豆 \"dòu\" \"(soy) bean\", usually rendered as トウ. Further, long vowels in the Japanese transcription need not reflect Chinese pronunciation. For example, the dish 東坡肉 \"Dongpo pork\", in pinyin \"dōngpōròu\" (\"dōng·pō·ròu\"), is represented in Japanese as ドンポーロウ \"donpōrou,\" or more commonly トンポーロウ \"tonpōrou.\" Note that in Chinese pinyin \"ō\" represents a high tone, while in Japanese \"ō\" represents a long vowel, and /d/ is pronounced differently (Chinese /d/ is similar to Japanese or English /t/). This distinction is not always followed, and varies by term: the spelling トンポーロー \"tonpōrō\" is also common; and in terms such as 回鍋肉 twice cooked pork, the spelling ホイコーロー is more common, despite representing diphthongs.\n\nIn modern times, an extended katakana system has developed to cater for foreign sounds not present in Japanese. Most of these novel katakana forms are digraphs, composed of standard katakana characters, but in digraph combinations not found in native words. For example, the word \"photo\" is transcribed as フォト (\"fo-to\"), where the novel digraph フォ (\"fo\") is made up from フ (normally \"fu\") plus a novel small combining form of オ (normally \"o\"). In other cases novel diacritics may be applied to create new sounds, such as ヴ for \"vu\", which consists of ウ (\"u\") combined with a dakuten to indicate a voiced pronunciation.\n\nJapanese is written without spaces between words, and, to aid understanding, foreign phrases and names are sometimes transliterated with an interpunct separating the words, called a ; for example, (Bill Gates). When it is assumed that the reader knows the separate \"gairaigo\" words in the phrase, the middle dot is omitted, especially for wasei eigo. For example, the phrase \"konpyūtā gēmu\" (\"computer game\") contains two well-known gairaigo, and therefore is not written with a middle dot; the same principle is applied for \"panti sutokkingu\" (\"pantyhose\", lit. \"panty stocking\"), Japanese coinage.\n\nThe following tables give the Hepburn romanization and an approximate IPA transcription for katakana as used in contemporary Japanese. Their use in transcription is, of course, in the inverse direction.\n\nThe following katakana (\"tokushuon\") have been developed or proposed specifically for the purposes of transcribing foreign words. Examples such as トゥ(tu) in カートゥーン(cartoon), ティ(ti) in パーティ(party), ツァ (tsa) in モーツァルト(Mozart) are found mostly in foreign words.\n\n"}

Parameswara Iyer (18 June 1877 – 15 June 1949) (commonly known as Ulloor) was a Malayalam poet and historian. He was one of the triumvirate poets of Kerala in the first half of the 20th century, along with Kumaran Asan and Vallathol Narayana Menon.\n\nUlloor was born at the Thamarassery Illam at Perunna, Changanassery. Since his ancestral home was at Ulloor, he came to be known as \"Ulloor\" S. Parameswara Iyer. His father died when he was young and his mother raised him. He graduated with Honors in Philosophy from Maharajas College and joined the Travancore State Services. Later he took Degree in Law and Master's in Malayalam and Tamil. He was later appointed as the income tax officer and then as the Chief Secretary.\n\nUlloor published his mahakavya \"Umakeralam\" in 1914. Until then, only Pandalam Kerala Varma's \"Rukmamgadacharitham\" was considered as a complete mahakavya in Malayalam. Poet K. Ayyappa Paniker has noted that \"Umakeralam\" is a \"work of great devotion: devotion to the land, to the language, to a poetic tradition\" Ulloor, like his contemporaries Kumaran Asan and Vallathol Narayana Menon, also wrote a number of short narratives or \"khandakavyas\", of which the most famous are \"Karnabhooshanam\" and \"Pingala\". In the former he celebrates Karna's infinite generosity and dedication to principles. In the latter he tries to portray the transformation of a courtesan overnight into a pious and refined character - almost a saint. Some of his other best known works were \"Bhakthideepika\", and \"Chithrasala\". Uloor also wrote quite a large number of lyrics and shorter pieces, now available in various collections.\n\nAfter Ulloor's death, the University of Kerala published one of his most noted works \"Kerala Sahitya Charithram\", which describes the history of Malayalam language, culture, and literature. He studied ancient literature and palm leaf manuscripts to bring out old literary works such as \"Rama Charitham\" poem and \"Doothavakyam\" prose.\n\nThe Indian Posts and Telegraph department released a commemorative stamp after Ulloor's death. A full size statue of Ulloor was unveiled by the Indian President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy in Thiruvananthapuram on 15 May 1981.\n\n"}

Tradition has evolved that there are words or phrases that are deemed inappropriate for use in the legislature whilst it is in session. In a Westminster system, this is called unparliamentary language and there are similar rules in other kinds of legislative systems. This includes, but is not limited to, the suggestion of dishonesty or the use of profanity. Most unacceptable is any insinuation that another member is dishonourable. So, for example, suggesting that another member is lying is forbidden.\n\nExactly what constitutes unparliamentary language is generally left to the discretion of the Speaker of the House. Part of the speaker's job is to enforce the assembly's debating rules, one of which is that members may not use \"unparliamentary\" language. That is, their words must not offend the dignity of the assembly. In addition, legislators in some places are protected from prosecution and civil actions by parliamentary immunity which generally stipulates that they cannot be sued or otherwise prosecuted for anything spoken in the legislature. Consequently they are expected to avoid using words or phrases that might be seen as abusing that immunity.\n\nLike other rules that have changed with the times, speakers' rulings on unparliamentary language reflect the tastes of the period.\n\nIn the Australian Senate, the words \"liar\" and \"dumbo\" were ordered to be withdrawn and deemed unparliamentary during a session in 1997.\n\nIn Belgium there is no such thing as unparliamentary language. A member of parliament is allowed to say anything he or she wishes when inside parliament. This is considered necessary in Belgium to be able to speak of a democratic state and is a constitutional right. Nevertheless, on 27 March 2014, Laurent Louis, acting as an independent (not party-related), called the prime minister (Elio Di Rupo) a pedophile. The other members of parliament left the room in protest. This immunity that manifests itself in an absolute freedom of speech when in parliament does not exist when outside of parliament. In that case prosecution is possible when and if the majority of parliament decides so.\n\nThese are some of the words and phrases that speakers through the years have ruled \"unparliamentary\" in the Parliament of Canada, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, and the National Assembly of Québec:\n\nThe President of the Legislative Council ordered out for using the following phrases:\nThe following phrases have been deemed unparliamentary by the President of the Legislative Council:\nIn 2012, the Indian Parliament published a book of words and phrases that were considered to be unparliamentary:\n\nIn Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (Parliament) in Ireland, the Ceann Comhairle (chair) has ruled that it is disorderly for one Teachta Dála (deputy) to describe another as a:\n\nOr to insinuate that a TD is lying or drunk; or has violated the secrets of cabinet, or doctored an official report. Also, the reference to \"handbagging\", particularly with reference to a female member of the House, has been deemed to be unparliamentary.\nThe Dáil maintains a document, \"Salient Rulings of the Chair\" which covers behaviour in and out of the House by TDs; section 428 of this lists unparliamentary speech.\n\nIn December 2009, Paul Gogarty apologised in advance for using \"unparliamentary language\" prior to shouting \"fuck you!\" at an opposition chief whip. This phrase was not one of those listed explicitly as inappropriate, prompting calls for a review. Seán Barrett, Ceann Comhairle of the 31st Dáil accused TDs of being like \"gurriers shouting on a street at each other\". He said he would not apologise for this.\n\nThe use of foul language in Parliament produced jurisprudence by the constitutional court, which has implemented the libel suits.\n\nThe Parliament of New Zealand maintains a list of words, and particularly phrases, that the Speaker has ruled are unbecoming, insulting, or otherwise unparliamentary. These include:\n\nThe Parliament also maintains a list of language that has been uttered in the House, and has been found not to be unparliamentary; this includes:\n\nIn 2009, a member of the Progress Party was interrupted during question period by the Speaker for calling a minister a \"highway bandit\".\n\nIn the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the following words have been deemed unparliamentary over time:\n\nIn addition, accusations of 'crooked deals' or insinuation of the use of banned substances by a member are considered unparliamentary language (all attributable to Dennis Skinner). An accusation that an MP's presence in the house has \"been bought\" is also unparliamentary.\n\nThe word 'dodgy' when used by Ed Miliband, was not however, found to be unparliamentary.\n\nThe Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, William Hay MLA, gave a ruling in the Chamber on 24 November 2009 on unparliamentary language. In essence rather than making judgements on the basis of particular words or phrases that have been ruled to be unparliamentary in the Assembly or elsewhere the Speaker said that he would judge Members' remarks against standards of courtesy, good temper and moderation which he considered to be the standards of parliamentary debate. He went on to say that in making his judgement he would consider the nature of Members' remarks and the context in which they were made. In 2013, Hay ruled that insinuation of MLAs being members of proscribed organizations was unparliamentary language.\n\nIn the National Assembly for Wales the Presiding Officer has intervened when the term \"lying\" has been used. In December 2004, the Presiding Officer notably sent Leanne Wood out of the chamber for referring to Queen Elizabeth II as 'Mrs Windsor'.\n\nIn the USA, representatives were censured for using unparliamentary language in the House of Representatives throughout its history. Other levels of government have similar disciplinary procedures dealing with inappropriate words spoken in the legislature.\n\nIt is a point of pride among some British MPs to be able to insult their opponents in the House without use of unparliamentary language. Several MPs, notably Sir Winston Churchill, have been considered masters of this game.\n\nSome terms which have evaded the Speaker's rules are:\n\n\nClare Short implicitly accused the Employment minister Alan Clark of being drunk at the dispatch box shortly after her election in 1983, but avoided using the word, saying that Clark was \"incapable\". Clark's colleagues on the Conservative benches in turn accused Short of using unparliamentary language and the Speaker asked her to withdraw her accusation. Clark later admitted in his diaries that Short had been correct in her assessment. In 1991, Speaker Bernard Weatherill, adjudged that usage of \"jerk\" by Opposition leader Neil Kinnock was not unparliamentary language.\n\n"}

{"id": "10874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10874", "title": "West Flemish", "text": "West Flemish\n\nWest Flemish (, ) is a dialect of the Dutch language spoken in western Belgium and adjoining parts of the Netherlands and France.\n\nWest Flemish is spoken by about a million people in the Belgian province of West Flanders, and a further 120,000 in the neighbouring Dutch coastal district of Zeelandic Flanders (and another 220,000 if Zealandic is included), and 10,000 in the northern part of the French \"département\" of Nord. Some of the main cities where West Flemish is widely spoken are Bruges, Kortrijk, Ostend, Roeselare, and Ypres. The dialects of the rest of the Dutch province of Zeeland, Zeelandic, are often included in West Flemish; these are part of a dialect continuum which proceeds further north into Hollandic.\n\nWest Flemish is listed as a \"vulnerable\" language in UNESCO's online Red Book of Endangered Languages. The language has its own dedicated Wikipedia.\n\nWest Flemish has a phonology that differs significantly from that of Standard Dutch. The best known traits are the replacement of Standard Dutch (pre-)velar fricatives \"g\" and \"ch\" in Dutch () with glottal \"h\" and the overall lack of diphthongs. The following differences are listed by their Dutch spelling, as some different letters have merged their sounds in Standard Dutch but remained separate sounds in West Flemish. Pronunciations can also differ slightly from region to region.\n\n\nThe nonexistentce of and in West Flemish makes pronuncing them very difficult for native speakers. That often causes hypercorrection of the sounds to a or .\n\nStandard Dutch also has many words with an \"-en\" () suffix (mostly plural forms of verbs and nouns). While Standard Dutch and most dialects do not pronounce the final \"n\", West Flemish typically drops the \"e\" and pronounces the \"n\" inside the base word. For base words already ending with \"n\", the final \"n\" sound is often lengthened to clarify the suffix. That makes many words become similar to those of English: \"beaten\", \"listen\" etc.\n\nThe short \"o\" () can also be pronounced as a short \"u\" (). That happens spontaneously to some words, but other words keep their original short \"o\" sounds. Similarly, the short \"a\" () can turn into a short \"o\" () in some words spontaneously.\n\nThe diphthong \"ui\" () does not exist in West Flemish and is replaced by a long \"u\" () or a long \"ie\" (). Like for the \"ui\", the long \"o\" () can be replaced by an (\"eu\") for some words but a for others. That often causes similarities to ranchers English.\n\nHere are some examples showing the sound shifts that are part of the vocabulary:\nPlural forms in Standard Dutch most often add \"-en\", but West Flemish usually uses \"-s\", like the Lower Saxon Germanic dialects and even more prominently in English in which \"-en\" has become very rare. Under the influence of Standard Dutch, \"-s\" is being used by fewer people, and younger speakers tend to use \"-en\".\n\nThe verbs \"zijn\" (\"to be\") and \"hebben\" (\"to have\") are also conjugated differently.\n\nWest Flemish often has a double subject.\n\nStandards Dutch has an indefinite article that does not depend on gender, unlike in West Flemish. However, a gender-independent article is increasingly used. Like in English, \"n\" is pronounced only if the next word begins with a vowel sound.\n\nAnother feature of West Flemish is the conjugation of \"ja\" and \"nee\" (\"yes\" and \"no\") to the subject of the sentence. That is somewhat related to the double subject, but even when the rest of the sentence is not pronounced, \"ja\" and \"nee\" are generally used with the first part of the double subject. There is also an extra word, \"toet\" (), negates the previous sentence but gives a positive answer.\n\n\"Ja\", \"nee\" and \"toet\" can also all be strengthened by adding \"mo-\" or \"ba-\". Both mean \"but\" and are derived from Dutch \"but\" or \"maar\") and can be even used together (\"mobatoet\").\n\nWest Flemish inherited many words from Saxon settlers and later on had English loanwords from the wool and cloth trades. Both categories differ from Standard Dutch and show similarities with English and so is difficult to separate both categories.\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the increasing trade with France caused many industrial loanwords from French.\n\nEven when words exist in both Dutch and West Flemish, their meaning can be different. That sometimes causes confusion for native speakers who do not realise that words are used differently.\n\n\n"}
