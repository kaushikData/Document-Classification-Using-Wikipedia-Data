It was later given the formal short title of the Succession to the Crown Act 1534.\n\nThe Act required all those asked to take the oath to recognise Anne Boleyn as King Henry VIII's lawful wife and their children legitimate heirs to the throne. Anyone refusing to take the oath was guilty of treason.\n\nThe Oath of Succession itself went further than the original Act in several ways. It demanded that persons swearing the oath renounce the power of any \"foreign authority or potentate\" and repudiate any oath previously made to such an authority. This discrepancy did not go unnoticed by Sir Thomas More who claimed he had been sent to the Tower \"for refusing of this oath not agreeable with the statute\". He thought that Thomas Cromwell and Thomas Audley \"did of their own heads add more words unto it\" and therefore they were unable \"by their own law ... to justify my imprisonment\".\n\nRefusal to take the oath led to the arrests of Sir Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher for treason in 1534. They refused to take the oath because it included the abjuration of the pope and claimed the marriage between King Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon was annulled and it went against their Roman Catholic beliefs. More and Fisher were beheaded in 1535.\n\n"}

{"id": "1265563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1265563", "title": "Alyutor language", "text": "Alyutor language\n\nAlyutor or Alutor is a language of Russia that belongs to the Chukotkan branch of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages.\n\nThe Alutor are the indigenous inhabitants of the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula. The language is unwritten and moribund; in the 1970s residents of the chief Alutor village of Vyvenka under the age of 25 did not know the language. In recent years the Vyvenka village school has started teaching the language. Until 1958 the language was considered the \"village\" (settled) dialect of the Koryak language, but it is not intelligible with traditionally nomadic varieties of Koryak. The autonym means \"villager\".\n\nAlutor is a polysynthetic language. \nThe morphology is agglutinative, with extensive prefixes and suffixes.\n\nThe argument structure is ergative.\n\nThe word order is variable, and it is difficult to say which typology is basic. The verb-absolutive orders AVO and VAO are perhaps most common.\n\nAlyutor has six vowels, five of which may be long or short. The schwa cannot be long or stressed.\n\nThere are 18 consonants in Alyutor.\n\nStress is generally on the second syllable of the word. However, it cannot fall on a schwa or the last syllable, so in two-syllable words stress is transferred to the first syllable, as long as that vowel is not a schwa. In cases where it is a schwa, a third syllable is added to the word, and the second syllable is stressed.\n\nExamples: 'water', 'husband', 'a mukluk (boot)', 'to feed'.\n\nAll Alyutor syllables begin with a single consonant. If the vowel is short, including a schwa, they may also close with a single consonant.\n\nExamples are 'to work', 'eagle', 'parka'.\n\nAlyutor word boundaries always coincide with syllable boundaries.\n\nAlyutor has the following parts of speech: nouns, adjectives, numerals, pronouns, verbs, participles, adverbs, postpositions, conjunctions, and \"particles\".\n\nNouns are inflected for number, case, definiteness, and grammatical person.\n\nThere are three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural.\n\nThere are eleven cases: absolutive, ergative, locative, dative lative, prolative, contactive, causative, equative, comitative, and associative.\n\nNumber and case are expressed using a single affix. A suffix is used for all cases except the comitative and associative, which are expressed using circumfixes. There are two declensions, taught as three noun classes. The first class are nonhuman nouns of the first declension. Number is only distinguished in the absolutive case, though verbal agreement may distinguish number when these nouns are in the ergative. The second class are proper names and kin terms for elders. They are second declension, and distinguish number in the ergative, locative, and lative cases, as well as the absolutive. The third class are the other human nouns; they may be either first or second declension.\n\n\nGrammatical first and second person suffixes on nouns are used to equate a noun with participants in the discourse. They only appear in the absolutive, with an intervening \"j\" on nouns ending in a vowel and an \"i\" on nouns ending in a consonant.\n\n\nAlyutor has simple numerals for the numbers one to five, ten, and twenty. All other numbers are compounds based on these numerals.\n\nThere are finite (conjugated) and non-finite verbs. There are several conjugations.\n\nFinite verbs agree in person and number with their nuclear arguments; agreement is through both prefixes and suffixes. Transitive verbs agree with both arguments (ergative and absolutive), whereas intransitive verbs agree with their sole (absolutive) argument.\n\nVerbs distinguish two aspects, perfective, the bare stem, and imperfective, using the suffix \"-tkə / -tkən / -tkəni\". There are five moods, indicative, imperative, optative, potential (marked by the circumfix \"ta…(ŋ)\"), and conjunctive (prefix \"ʔ-/a-\").\n\nMonopersonal verbs include two declensions, one with the third-person singular in \"ɣa-...-lin,\" and the other in \"n-...-qin.\n\nFor impersonal forms of conjugation include verbal predicate (formed with the circumfix a…ka) and imperative (formed by circumfix ɣa…a/ta). Non-finite forms Impersonal forms include the verbal predicate with the circumfix \"a…ka,\" and the imperative in \"ɣa…a/ta.\"\n\nThese include the infinitive, supine, gerunds, and participles.\n\n\n"}

The celebrated poet Adib Beyzai, known as one of the most profound poets of 20th-century Iran, is Bahram's paternal uncle. Bahram Beyzaie's paternal grandfather, Mirzā Mohammad-Rezā Ārāni (\"Ebn Ruh\"), and paternal great-grandfather, the mulla Mohammad-Faqih Ārāni (\"Ruh'ol-Amin\"), were also notable poets.\n\nIn spite of his somewhat belated start in cinema, Beyzai is often considered a pioneer of a generation of filmmakers whose works are sometimes described as the Iranian New Wave. His \"Bashu, the Little Stranger\" (1986) was voted \"Best Iranian Film of all time\" in November 1999 by a Persian movie magazine \"Picture World\" poll of 150 Iranian critics and professionals. Still, even before the outset of his cinematic career in 1970, he was a leading playwright (as well as theater historian), so much so that he is often considered the greatest playwright of the Persian language, and holds a reputation as \"the Shakespeare of Persia.\"\n\nSince 2010, Beyzai has lived and taught at Stanford University, United States.\n\nBeyzaie was born in Tehran, to a poet, anthologist and biographer father and a housewife mother. Zokā'i Beyzāie made a living through a legal occupation and was able to attend to his literary interests reasonably.\n\nThe young Bahram did not seem very interested in his family legacy, being poetry, which was pursued by his father, uncles and cousins. In high school, the Dar'ol-Fonoun, he wrote two historical plays which went on to become his preferred method of writing. He started skipping school from around the age of 17 in order to go to movies which were becoming popular in Iran at a rapid pace. This only fed his hunger to learn more about cinema and Iranian visual arts.\n\nAfter school, and after a year of waiting before passing the competitive examination for university admission and meanwhile reading the \"Shahnameh\", he began to study Persian literature at the University of Tehran. But it became impossible for him to stay in the university, particularly because his professors would not accept his researching Persian theatre as a graduate work, arguing that \"Persia has had no theatre.\"\n\nAt the age of 21 he did substantial research on the traditional Persian plays, particularly Ta'zieh, and by 1961 he had already spent a great deal of time studying and researching other ancient Persian and pre-Islamic culture and literature. This in turn led him to studying Eastern theatre and traditional Iranian theatre and arts which would help him formulate a new non-Western identity for Iranian theatre. He also became acquainted with Persian painting.\n\nBy late 1961 he had already published numerous articles in various arts and literary journals. In 1962 he made his first short film (4 minutes) in 8 mm format. In the next two years he wrote several plays and published \"Theatre in Japan\".\n\nIn the next eight or so years of his life throughout the early to late 1960s, Bayzai dedicated himself to writing in various publications about Eastern art and Persian literature enabled through his extensive study and also wrote a number of essays about Iranian cinema which later became the subject of one of his books. It is during this period that he wrote popular plays which are often regarded as masterpieces; \"Sindbad's Eighth Voyage\", \"Banquet\", \"Serpent King\", \"The Marionettes\", \"The Story of the Hidden Moon\" and many more.\n\nIn 1968, Beyzai was one of the nine founders of the Iranian Writers' Guild, a highly controversial organization in the face of censorship. In 1969 he was invited to teach at the Theater Department of the College of Fine Arts at University of Tehran. He chaired this department from 1972 to 1979. With his readership many prominent authors and artists started teaching at the department and created the most fruitful period in the history of that department.\nHis daughter, Niloofar Beyzaie, is a theater director and playwright. \n\nBeyzaie's early study and interest in drama and the theatre is well known, but less well-known is his early work as a dramatist. As a young man Beyzaie had always been fascinated by the traditions of Iranian theatre, and this included the puppet theatre. His \"Se Nemayeshname-ye 'Arusaki\" (\"Three Puppet Plays\") was published in 1963, and \"The Marionettes\" was the first one of these three plays. But for all that it is unmistakably based on the model of the traditional puppet theatre, \"The Marionettes\" is shaped by other traditions, too. It is the work of someone au fait with the work of Pirandello and the Theatre of the Absurd. In the 1960s, plays by dramatists such as Beckett and Ionesco were often translated into the Persian language and performed in Iran soon after their premieres in the West). Drawing on these varied influences, Beyzaie's play is a little-known master-piece of 20th-century drama. \nBeyzaie's groundbreaking \"A Study on Iranian Theatre\" (Namayesh dar Iran), published in mid-1960s is still considered the most important text on the history of Iranian theater. Beyzaie is also the first scholar in Iran to publish books on theatre of Japan and theatre of China.\nSome of his plays, such as his masterpiece \"Death of Yazdgerd\", have been translated into numerous languages and have been performed around the world. \"Death of Yazdgerd\" has been performed in Iran, France, England, India and USA among other countries, and was made into a highly acclaimed film of the same name by Beyzai in 1981. \"Death of Yazdgerd\" and \"Kalat Claimed\" have been translated into English by Manuchehr Anvar.\n\nIn 1969 he began his film career by directing the short film \"Amu Sibilou\" (Uncle Moustache) followed by \"Safar\" in 1970. With these films Beyzai is often supposed to be a pioneer of what is called the Iranian New Wave, a Persian cinema movement that is supposed to have spontaneously started in the late 1960s, i.e. ignoring earlier efforts by filmmakers such as Farrokh Ghaffari and Ebrahim Golestan, and includes other outstanding directors such as Nasser Taghvai, Forough Farrokhzad, Amir Naderi, Ali Hatami, Sohrab Shahid Sales, Dariush Mehrjui, Abbas Kiarostami, Parviz Kimiavi, Masoud Kimiai and Fereydun Gole among others; and soon following Khosrow Sinai, Masoud Jafari Jozani, Kianoush Ayari, Varuzh Karim-Masihi, Ebrahim Hatamikia and others.\n\nImmediately after, in 1971, he made his first feature film \"Ragbar\" (\"Downpour\") which is regarded by critics to this day as one of the most successful Iranian films ever made. The successful film addresses the late Parviz Fannizadeh as its central character and protagonist.\n\nSince then he has produced and directed 8 films including \"Qaribe va Meh (Stranger and the Fog)\" (1974), \"Cherike-ye Tara (Ballad of Tara)\" (1979), \"Bashu, the Little Stranger\" (1986, released in 1989), \"Shāyad Vaghti digar (Maybe another time)\" (1988) and \"Mosaferan (Travellers)\" (1992).\n\nIn 1981, the revolutionary leaders started the Iranian Cultural Revolution, as a result of which Beyzaie among many others was expelled from the university. He continued writing and making films though. His screenplay \"Ruz-e Vaqe'e\" (\"The Fateful Day\") was adapted into a film in 1995 and another screenplay was adapted into a film named \"Fasl-e Panjom\" (The fifth season) in 1996, whilst he also made four of his finest films. He also edited Ebrahim Hatamikia's \"Borj-e Minu (Minoo Tower)\".\n\nHe married the actress and make-up artist Mozhdeh Shamsai in 1992. After \"Mosaferan\", he failed to get a permit for the production of a number of screenplays. In 1995 he left Iran for Strasbourg at the invitation of the International Parliament of Writers. Soon however he returned and staged \"The Lady Aoi\" in Tehran.\n\nIn 2001 he made his best-selling film \"Killing Mad Dogs\", after which he managed to stage three plays as well before he left Iran for the United States.\n\nHe left Iran in 2010 at the invitation of Stanford University, and has since been the Daryabari Visiting Professor of Iranian Studies, teaching courses in Persian theatre, cinema and mythology. There he has given workshops on the \"Shahnameh\", the history of Iranian performing arts, Iranian as well as Semitic myths, etc. He has also staged several of his plays including his nine-hour \"Tarabnameh\".\n\nHe is known as the most intellectual and conspicuous \"author\" in Iranian cinema and theater. The main theme of his works is the history and \"crisis of identity\" which is related to Iranian cultural and mythical symbols and paradigms. He is considered as Iran's most prominent screenwriter in terms of dramatic integrity of his works, many of which have been made into films.\n\nBeyzaie has made significant contribution to the development of the cinema of Iran and theatre and is regarded as an influential director and innovator of the Iranian New Wave movement of cinema. He is also considered Iran's most prominent screenwriter in terms of dramatic integrity of his works, many of which have been made into films.\n\nHowever, despite the value of his films and his substantial knowledge of the arts, like many other Iranian film directors such as Nasser Taghvai, Varuzh Karim-Masihi, Kianoush Ayari and many others, the Government of Iran has almost never supported his career, before and after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Before the revolution he was handed in the best prize by the Queen Farah Diba in Tehran Film festival in 1972 as a new young director whose talent was lauded with appreciation and applaud for his Film Ragbar. After revolution now even after some 20 years, his films such as \"Ballad of Tara\" (1980) and \"Death of Yazdgerd\" (1981) have never received a screening permit in Iran. Both films have been shelved because they are not in accordance with the Islamic code currently in operation in Iranian motion pictures. Even \"Bashu, the Little Stranger\" almost saw the same fate in 1986 due to the subject matter of the film, i.e. the story of a little orphaned boy who lost his parents in the Iran-Iraqi war. The film was only legalized after the end of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War and was released in 1989.\n\nCritics have often praised Beyzai above all Persian filmmakers as well as playwrights. He was voted the best Persian filmmaker of all time in 2002, and his \"Bashu, the Little Stranger\" was voted the finest Persian film of all time. All the same, his formalism has occasionally raised criticism, even from himself. Ebrahim Golestan, who had previously made objections to Beyzai's style, praised him in a letter in 2017.\n\n\nBeyzaie has over 50 published plays, some of which are as follows. These works have occasionally appeared in French, English, German and other translations too.\n\nThe prizes, awards and honors he has won are numerous.\n\n\n\n"}

The acronym was largely popularised by the Polish hip hop music, where it is often used in lyrics. It is a specific expression of protest against the authorities, and against \"the system\" in general. \n\nCorrect spelling of the acronym, according to Polish orthography, is CHWDP, with Ch digraph in the beginning. However, common mistake is a misspelling of \"chuj\" as \"huj\", against orthography rules, but pronounced the same, hence often seen HWDP acronym.\n\nThe slogan is already very important in Poland, and its popularity is spreading to other countries, most notably Slovakia and Germany. Pranksters have used it in England. The popularity of this slogan is rapidly growing.\n\nOne of the ways in which the popularity of the acronym is easily noticed is that it was given many alternative expansions. Still, the basic meaning is generally known. Others are merely jokes that are sometimes used to avoid awkward situations and to relieve the tension, e.g. when people who propagate this abbreviation talk with the police or by the policemen who want to avoid embarrassment when they are asked to expand the abbreviation during interviews.\n\nHowever, the popularity of this acronym is not limited to it being spraypainted on the walls in Poland. In fact, the acronym has also spread among the Internet users, both Polish and foreign.\n\nIn recent times players of a popular online game Spartan wars by Tap4fun that have had run ins with game moderators have changed their character names to HWDP taking a swing at the moderators as they are essentially the games policing unit\n\nThe slogan is also popular in Czech Republic, where it is written as ČDPP, standing for \"Čůrák do prdele policii\", meaning the same as the Polish \"Chuj w dupę policji\"; i.e. \"Fuck the police in the ass\". However, its Polish counterparts, CHWDP and HWDP, are just as common in the Czech Republic as well. The slogan can be found in Slovakia as well.\n"}

{"id": "13757374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13757374", "title": "Cold ironing", "text": "Cold ironing\n\nCold ironing, or shore connection, shore-to-ship power (SSP) or alternative maritime power (AMP), is the process of providing shoreside electrical power to a ship at berth while its main and auxiliary engines are turned off. Cold ironing permits emergency equipment, refrigeration, cooling, heating, lighting and other equipment to receive continuous electrical power while the ship loads or unloads its cargo. Shorepower is a general term to describe supply of electric power to ships, small craft, aircraft and road vehicles while stationary.\n\nCold ironing is a shipping industry term that first came into use when all ships had coal-fired engines. When a ship tied up at port there was no need to continue to feed the fire and the iron engines would literally cool down, eventually going completely cold, hence the term \"cold ironing\".\n\nShutting down main engines while in port continues as a majority practice. However, auxiliary diesel generators that power cargo handling equipment and other ship's services while in port are the primary source of air emissions from ships in ports today, because the auxiliaries run on heavy fuel oil or bunkers. Cold ironing mitigates harmful emissions from diesel engines by connecting a ship's load to a more environmentally friendly, shore-based source of electrical power. An alternative is to run auxiliary diesels either on gas (LNG or LPG) or extra low sulphur distillate fuels, however if noise pollution is a problem, then cold ironing becomes the only option.\n\nA ship can cold iron by simply connecting to another ship's power supply. Naval ships have standardized processes and equipment for this procedure. However, this does not change the power source type nor does it eliminate the source of air pollution.\n\nThe source for land-based power may be grid power from an electric utility company, but also possibly an external remote generator. These generators may be powered by diesel or renewable energy sources such as wind, water or solar.\n\nShore power saves consumption of fuel that would otherwise be used to power vessels while in port, and eliminates the air pollution associated with consumption of that fuel. Use of shore power facilitates maintenance of the ship's engines and generators, and reduces noise.\n\nUnlike navies, whose ships can berth for extended periods at their bases, merchant ships have shorter port stays, during which they sustain electrical loads through on-board fossil fuel powered electrical generators (auxiliary engines). Oceangoing ships have generally not been subject to emissions controls, so merchant vessels throughout the world have been using Bunker Fuel or HFO – which is residual petroleum – as the optimal choice of fuel. This fuel has high particulate matter. Studies show that a single ship can produce particulate emissions equal to the same amount as 50 million cars annually.\n\nFurther research indicates 60,000 cardio-pulmonary mortalities due to particulate matter from ship emissions. These deaths have been detected far inland, due to prevailing wind conditions. The total world trading fleet stands at 50,000+ merchant ships (Lloyds data as of January 2008). Each ship spends some 100 days in port in a year.\n\n\"For every of electricity, about 200 g of bunker fuel is consumed. Each 1 kg of bunker oil generates 3.1 kg of carbon dioxide. It is assessed that globally ships use 411,223,484 tonnes of fuel annually.\"\nKeeping these reports in mind, new regulatory norms have been mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The level of sulphur is one of the benchmarks in measuring quality of fuel and Marpol Annex VI requires use of <4.5% sulphur fuel, effective 2010. The target is to reduce world maritime sulphur output to <0.5% by 2020. Some regions (e.g., California) already require ships switch to cleaner fuel when in their local waters.\n\nCold ironing does away with the need to burn fossil fuel on board the ships while they are docked. Under this concept as it is promulgated, ships visiting ports are hooked on to local grid power or other power sources, which are already regulated by local pollution norms. This externally sourced power serves the ship's internal cargo handling machinery and hotelling requirements. Effectively, all the power generating sources are shut down and ship is hence cold-ironed.\nThis brings immediate relief from pollution by shipboard emissions and allows a more holistic maintenance schedule to be followed by ship operators, which are typically hard put to maintain planned maintenance schedules due to commercial operating pressures. The immediate result is lowered heat outputs from ships, lowered air emissions, lowered risk of accidents from fuel based machinery, lowered disturbance to the ecosystem, among various others.\n\n\nAll these problems are addressable and work has already begun in reducing ship emissions by cold ironing.\n\nVarious studies are being conducted to fully implement a viable, controllable and monitored method of powering the most important arm of modern-day logistics, the merchant ships.\n\nThe U.S. State of California is requiring a percentage of ships calling there to use shore power by 2014. The Port of Oakland is implementing a High Voltage Shore Connection (HVSC) at 6,600 volts. The first Hapag-Lloyd vessel to use the system, \"Dallas Express,\" docked there in December 2012. The electrical and mechanical equipment to interface the ship's electrical load with the shore power is in a 40-foot container at the vessel's stern. Initially 15 Hapag-Lloyd ships will receive the system.\n\nThe Massachusetts Port Authority carried out a study of cold ironing and alternatives in 2016 that pointed out a number of problems, including the high peak power demand (13 MW for a cruise ship, 3 MW for a container ship) and the high cost of providing the necessary equipment and upgraded electrical power infrastructure for Boston Harbor. It also expressed concern about loss of competitiveness without a U.S. East Coast regional agreement to install such systems. The ports of Halifax and Brooklyn have installed cold ironing at one cruise-ship berth each at a cost of $10 and $20 million, respectively, mostly paid by government grants.\n\n\n"}

They are frequently the subject of guides and seminars on how to make friends and/or meet people. Different situations may call for different openers (e.g. approaching a stranger on the street versus meeting them at a more structured gathering of people with like interests).\n\nAn opener often takes the form of an open-ended question, which can lead to further comments or conversation as well as creating topics for future conversations (e.g. \"How's your mandrill doing?\").\n\nA closed-ended question (e.g. \"Nice weather today, isn't it?\") is regarded as potentially less effective because it can be answered with a simple \"Mm-hmm,\" which is essentially a conversational dead end, requiring the initiater of the conversation to start from scratch.\n\n\"How to Start a Conversation\" notes that in conversation openers, \"There really are only two topics to choose from – The situation [or] the other person. Secondly, there are only two ways to begin a conversation: State a fact [or] ask a question/opinion\". Accordingly, openers are often linked to props, e.g. \"Do you have a cigarette?\" \"Wow, you're reading \"Crime and Punishment\", that's one of my favorite books...\" \"I like your skirt, where did you get it?\" etc. Many venues, such as singles tennis events, etc. are geared toward prop-based conversation openers. Some people keep conversation pieces for this purpose.\n\nJudy Ringer's \"We Have to Talk: A Step-By-Step Checklist for Difficult Conversations\" points out that an entirely different set of openers may be used for sensitive conversations, e.g. about employee performance, in which a main goal may be to avoid putting the person on the defensive. These openers often take the form of I statements, e.g. \"I have something I’d like to discuss with you that I think will help us work together more effectively\".\n\nIn sales settings, conversation openers often are used to probe the subject for information. Topic chosen are on 'safe ground' like 'the weather' or 'how was your journey to get here'. This information can then be used in attempts to counter objections.\n\nThis type of conversation opener is often referred to as small talk and is used to make both people in a conversation feel comfortable. The book \"Get Noticed\" by Marcus A Taylor and Rob Lawrence explains how mastering the art of small talk involves active listening, being up to date with current affairs as well as identifying common interests to develop the conversation.\n"}

{"id": "3850849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3850849", "title": "Cuvée", "text": "Cuvée\n\nCuvée () is a French wine term that derives from \"cuve\", meaning vat or tank. Wine makers use the term \"cuvée\" with several different meanings, more or less based on the concept of a tank of wine put to some purpose.\n\n\"Cuvée\" on wine labels generally denotes wine of a specific blend or batch. Since the term \"cuvée\" for this purpose is unregulated, and most wines have been stored in a vat or tank at some stage of production, the presence of the word \"cuvée\" on a label of an arbitrary producer is no guarantee of superior quality. However, discerning producers who market both regular blends and blends they call \"\"cuvée\"...\" usually reserve the word for special blends or selected vats of higher quality—at least in comparison to that producer's regular wines. Particularly terms like \"cuvée speciale\", or \"tête de cuvée\" (the latter especially in Sauternes AOC) are supposed to indicate higher quality. In this context, higher-quality than ordinary cuvées are often referred to as \"reserve wines\", while a \"cuvée\" lower in quality than the main one is a \"second wine\".\n\nIn some regions, \"cuvée\" specifically means a blend, i.e., a wine produced from a mixture of several grape varieties, rather than from a single variety. This is especially true outside France.\n\nIn Champagne, and sometimes other regions, producing sparkling wines by the traditional method, \"cuvée\" also refers to the best grape juice from gentle pressing of the grapes. In Champagne, the cuvée is the first 2,050 litres of grape juice from 4,000 kg of grapes (a \"marc\"), while the following 500 litres are known as the \"taille\" (tail), and are expected to give wines of a coarser character. Many Champagne producers pride themselves on only using the cuvée in their wine.\n\nThe term can also apply to beer, or to chocolate to refer to a batch that is blended by the manufacturers to produce a certain taste. Many lambics and gueuzes—sour beers with wine-like characteristics—are marketed as \"cuvée\". When referring to beer, ale, or chocolate the term has no defined meaning, but is meant to evoke images of higher quality—similar to the use of \"reserve\" for wine in areas where the term is not regulated by law.\n\nThe term can also apply to cognac. For instance, 3.140 \"cuvée\", which is not labelled with the standard classifications of VS, VSOP or XO a minimum of six years before bottling.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57098", "title": "Dessert wine", "text": "Dessert wine\n\nPudding wines, sometimes called dessert wines, are sweet wines typically served with dessert.\n\nThere is no simple definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white fortified wines (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal, and the red fortified wines (port and madeira) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Ximénez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all fortified wines - and is taxed more highly as a result. This dates back to a time when the US wine industry only made dessert wines by fortification, but such a classification is outdated now that modern yeast and viticulture can produce dry wines over 15% without fortification, yet German dessert wines can contain half that amount of alcohol.\n\nExamples include Sauternes and Tokaji Aszú.\n\nMakers of dessert wines want to produce a wine containing high levels of both sugar and alcohol, yet the alcohol is made from sugar. There are many ways to increase sugar levels in the final wine:\n\nIn the absence of other techniques, makers of dessert wine have to produce their sugar in the vineyard. Some grape varieties, such as Muscat, Ortega and Huxelrebe, naturally produce a lot more sugar than others. Environmental conditions have a big effect on ultimate sugar levels; the vigneron can help by leaving the grapes on the vine until they are fully ripe, and by green harvesting and pruning to expose the young grapes to the sun. Green harvesting reduces the number of bunches on a vine early in the summer, so that the sugar production of the leaves is divided between fewer bunches. Unfortunately the vigneron cannot control the sun, but a sunny year can help sugar levels a lot. The semi-sweet Auslese wines in the German wine classification are probably the best example of this approach; most modern winemakers perceive that their customers want either fully dry or 'properly' sweet dessert wines, so 'leave it to nature' is currently out of fashion. But most of the Muscats of ancient times were probably made this way, including the famous Constantia of South Africa.\n\nHoney was added to wine in Roman times, for sweetness and to increase the final strength of the wine. Today sugar is usually added in order to boost the alcohol levels of flabby, unripe wines rather than for sweetness, although a degree of chaptalization is permitted in the wines of many countries. German wines must declare whether they are 'natural' or not; in any case, chaptalization is banned from the top tiers of German wines.\n\nThe \"reserve of sweetness\" is a German technique in which unfermented must (grape juice) is added to the wine after fermentation. This increases the sweetness of the final wine, and dilutes the alcohol somewhatin Germany the final wine can contain no more than 15% Süssreserve by volume. Süssreserve allows winemakers to fully ferment the wine without having to worry about stopping fermentation before all the sugar has gone. Since sulphites are used to stop fermentation, this technique reduces the usage of sulphites. Süssreserve is used by other makers of German-style wines, particularly in New Zealand.\n\nThe main fortified wines drunk with dessert are sweet sherry, particularly Pedro Ximénez, and vins doux naturels. The Pedro Ximenez dessert wine is unique because it is a raisin wine that is then fortified and aged in a solera system like other sherries. Other sweet sherries such as Bristol Cream may also be drunk as dessert wine.\nThe production of vins doux naturels was perfected by Arnaud de Villeneuve at the University of Montpellier in the 13th century and they are now quite common in the Languedoc-Roussillon of southwest France. As the names suggest, Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes, Muscat de Frontignan, Muscat de Lunel, Muscat de Mireval and Muscat de St-Jean Minervois are all made from the white Muscat grape, whilst Banyuls and Maury are made from red Grenache. Regardless of the grape, fermentation is stopped with up to 10% of 95% grape spirit. The Muscats are made in a somewhat oxidised style, the Grenaches less so.\n\nIn ancient Carthage, a sweet wine called \"passum\" was made from air-dried grapes, and across the Malta Channel from the site of Carthage, similar wines are still made, called Moscato Passito di Pantelleria. Such wines were described by the Romans, and northern Italy is home to a number of 'passito' wines, where the grapes are dried on straw, on racks, or hung from the rafters. These wines include Vin Santo (into which almond biscuits ('cantucci') are traditionally dunked), Sciachetrà, Recioto di Soave (drunk with the local version of panettone) and the sweet red Recioto della Valpolicella (which stands up to chocolate better than most wine). Across the Alps, the French make 'straw wine' (\"vin de paille\") in the Jura, Rhone and Alsace, the Spanish start off making a raisin wine with Pedro Ximénez before fortifying it, the Cypriots have their ancient Commandaria and there have been recent experiments with the style in South Africa and the USA.\n\nMost wine laws require temperatures below at most −7 °C (19 °F) before the grapes for ice wine can be picked, At such temperatures, some of the water in the grapes freezes out, but the sugars and other solids remain dissolved in the remaining juice. If the grapes are pressed whilst frozen, a very concentrated must can result, which needs special yeast and a long time to ferment. The resulting wines are very sweet, but with lots of balancing acidity. The minuscule yields mean they tend to be very expensive. The most famous ice wines are German \"Eiswein\" and Canadian Icewine, but apart from these, ice wine is also made in the United States, Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Italy, Australia, France and New Zealand in smaller quantities.\n\nSome of the most famous dessert wines, such as Château d'Yquem of Sauternes and Tokaji Aszú of Tokaj-Hegyalja in Hungary, or Seewinkel in Austria are made using grapes mouldy with \"Botrytis cinerea\", which sucks water out of the grape whilst imparting flavours of honey and apricot to the future wine.\n\nThe fungus requires specific conditions to produce noble rot; if it is too damp, the same fungus causes destructive grey rot. Vignerons must ensure that they maximise the amount of noble rot without losing the whole crop to grey rot. Typically, noble rot forms best in conditions where morning mist forms from a nearby lake or the sea. The wait for noble rot to form is the reason why noble rot wines are usually late-harvested.\n\nThe first noble rot wines were likely created by accident—both the Hungarians and the Germans have similar stories of how the harvest was delayed for some reason, but the mouldy grapes were vinified anyway and then found to be delicious. Given that propensity to noble rot was a factor in Hungarian vineyard demarcations some 50 years before a messenger was supposedly mugged on his way to Schloss Johannisberg in Germany, the Hungarians probably have a better case.\n\nNoble rot is responsible for many other dessert wines, including Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese of the German wine classification, French Monbazillac, Austrian Beerenauslese, Ausbruch and TBA other wines from all over the world.\n\nA general rule is that the wine should be sweeter than the food it is served with - a perfectly ripe peach has been described as the ideal partner for many dessert wines, whereas it makes sense not to drink wine at all with many chocolate- and toffee-based dishes. Red dessert wines like Recioto della Valpolicella and fortified wines like the vin doux naturel Muscats are the best matches for such difficult-to-pair desserts.\nQuite often, the wine itself can be a dessert, but bakery sweets can make a good match, particularly with a little bitterness like the almond biscuits that are dunked in Vin Santo. A development of this matching of contrasts is a rich savoury dish like the foie gras that is a traditional partner to Sauternes.\nWhite dessert wines are generally served somewhat chilled, but can be easily served too cold. Red dessert wines are served at room temperature or slightly chilled.\n"}

It is southeast of the capital Kiev on the Dnieper River, in the south-central part of Ukraine. Dnipro is the administrative centre of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Administratively, it is incorporated as a city of oblast significance, the centre of \"Dnipro municipality\" and extraterritorial administrative centre of Dnipro Raion. Its population is approximately .\n\nThe first fortified town in what is now Dnipro was probably built in the mid-16th century according to archeological findings.\n\nKnown as \"Ekaterinoslav\" ( ; ) until 1925, the city was formally inaugurated by the Russian Empress Catherine the Great in 1787 as the administrative centre of the newly acquired vast territories of imperial \"New Russia\", including those ceded to Russia by the Ottoman Empire under the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774). The city was originally envisioned as the Russian Empire's third capital city, after Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Renamed Dnipropetrovsk in 1926, it became a vital industrial centre of Soviet Ukraine, and was one of the key centres of the nuclear, arms, and space industries of the Soviet Union. In particular, it is home to the Yuzhmash, a major space and ballistic missile design bureau and manufacturer. Because of its military industry, it was a closed city until the 1990s. On 19 May 2016 the official name of the city was changed from Dnipropetrovsk to \"Dnipro\".\n\nDnipro is a powerhouse of Ukraine's business and politics as the native city for many of the country's most important figures. Ukraine's politics are still defined by the legacies of Leonid Kuchma, Pavlo Lazarenko and Yuliya Tymoshenko whose intermingled careers started in Dnipro.\n\nOver time, Dnipro has been known by a number of names:\n\nThe spellings \"Katerynoslav\" and \"Catharinoslav\" are found on some maps from the nineteenth century.\n\nIn some Anglophone media the city was also known as the Rocket City.\n\nIn 1918, the Central Council of Ukraine proposed to change the name of the city to \"Sicheslav\"; however, this was never finallized.\n\nIn 1926 the city was renamed after Communist leader Grigory Petrovsky. The 2015 law on decommunization thus required the city had to be renamed. On 19 May 2016 the Ukrainian parliament passed a bill to officially rename the city to the name \"Dnipro\".\n\nA monastery was founded by Byzantine monks on Monastyrsky Island, probably in the 9th century (870 AD). The Tatars destroyed the monastery in 1240.\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, Tatar tribes inhabiting the right bank of the Dnieper were driven away by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By the mid-15th century, the Nogai (who lived north of the Sea of Azov) and the Crimean Khanate invaded these lands. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate agreed to a border along the Dnieper, and farther east along the Samara River (Dnieper), i.e. through what is today the city of Dnipro. It was in this time that a new force appeared: the free people, the Cossacks. They later became known as Zaporozhian Cossacks (Zaporizhia – the lands south of Prydniprovye, translate as \"The Land Beyond the Weirs [Rapids]\"). This was a period of raids and fighting causing considerable devastation and depopulation in that area; the area became known as the Wild Fields.\n\nArcheological findings strongly suggest that the first fortified town in what is now Dnipro was probably built in the mid-16th century. In 1635, the Polish Government built the Kodak fortress above the Dnieper Rapids at \"Kodaky\" (on the south-eastern outskirts of modern Dnipro), partly as a result of rivalry in the region between Poland, Turkey and Crimean Khanate, and partly to maintain control over Cossack activity (i.e. to suppress the Cossack raiders and to prevent peasants moving out of the area). On the night of ¾ August 1635, the Cossacks of Ivan Sulyma captured the fort by surprise, burning it down and butchering the garrison of about 200 West European mercenaries under Jean Marion. The fort was rebuilt by French engineer Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan for the Polish Government in 1638, and had a mercenary garrison. \"Kodak\" was captured by Zaporozhian Cossacks on 1 October 1648, and was garrisoned by the Cossacks until its demolition in accordance with the Treaty of the Pruth in 1711. The ruins of the Kodak are visible now. There is currently a project to restore it and create a tourist centre and park-museum.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Andrusovo, the lands of Zaporizhian Sich (around Kodak fortress) were under a condominium between the Russian Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Rzeczpospolita relinquished its control over the area with signing of the 1686 Treaty of Perpetual Peace and, thus, handing over Zaporizhia to Russia.\n\nIn 1688 Zaporozhian Cossacks and Tatar forces unsuccessfully tried to destroy the Russian troops in the town's Bohorodytsia Fortress (built for the Russian Tsar) but ended up destroying the unprotected lower town only. Cossacks in 1711 forced the Russians troops out of the town under the Treaty of the Pruth; this time in an alliance with the Tatars and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the mid-1730s Russians troops returned to the Bohorodytsia Fortress.\n\nThe Zaporozhian village of \"Polovytsia\" was founded in the late-1760s, between the settlements of Stari (Old) and Novi (New) Kodaky. It was located at the present centre of the city to the West to district of Central Terminal and the \"Ozyorka\" farmers market.\n\nDnipro was originally known as \"Ekaterinoslav\", which could be approximately rendered as \"the glory of Catherine\", presumably with reference to Catherine the Great (technically, the naming might have been in honour of Saint Catherine of Alexandria). It was founded in 1787\n(the official founding year was set to 1776 in 1976 in an effort to please the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev) as the administrative centre of Russia's newly re-established Azov Governorate, which in 1783 was merged into a much bigger Ekaterinoslav Viceroyalty; later, from 1796 to 1802, as \"Novorossiysk\", it was the centre of the recreated Novorossiya Governorate, and subsequently, till 1925, of the Ekaterinoslav Governorate.\n\nCossacks and the Russian army had fought against the Ottoman Empire for control of this area in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca ended this war in July 1774; and in May 1775 the Russian army destroyed the Zaporozhian Sich, thus eliminating the political autonomy of Cossacks. In 1775, Prince Grigori Potemkin was appointed governor of Novorossiya, and after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, he started founding cities in the region and encouraging foreign settlers. The original town of Yekaterinoslav was founded in 1776, not in the current location, but at the confluence of the River Samara with the River Kil'chen' at Loshakivka, north of the Dnieper. By 1782, the city population was 2,194. However the site had been badly chosen because spring waters were transforming the city into a bog. The settlement was later renamed Novomoskovsk. In 1783, Yekaterinoslav was refounded on its current site, on the south bank of the Dnieper, near the Zaporozhian village of Polovytsia. The population of \"Yekaterinoslav-Kil'chen\"' were (according to some sources) transferred to the new site. Potemkin's plans for the city were extremely ambitious. It was to be about in size, and included Transfiguration Cathedral (the claim that it was intended as the largest in the world probably results from confusing Potemkin's reference to San Paulo-fuori-le-mura in Rome with St Peter's Basilica.); The Potemkin palace; university (never built); botanical garden on Monastyrskyi Island and wide straight avenues through the city.\n\nThe cathedral's foundation stone was laid by Empress Catherine II and Austrian Emperor Joseph II, during Catherine's Crimean journey on , which was heralded as the official date of founding the city. Nevertheless, the cathedral as originally designed was never to be built. The site for the Potemkin palace was bought from retired Cossack yesaul (colonel) Lazar' Globa, who owned much of the land near the city. Part of Lazar' Globa's gardens still exist and are now called Globa Park.\n\nA combination of yet another Russo-Turkish war that broke out later in 1787, bureaucratic procrastination, defective workmanship, and theft resulted in what was built being less than originally planned. Construction stopped after the death of Potemkin and his sponsor, Empress Catherine, who was succeeded by her son Paul I known for his open antipathy to his mother's policies and undertakings. Plans were reconsidered and scaled back. The size of the cathedral was reduced, and it was completed in 1835.\n\nDespite the bridging of the Dnieper in 1796 and the growth of trade in the early 19th century, Ekaterinoslav remained small until the 1880s, when the railway was built and industrialization of the city began. The boom was caused by two men: John Hughes, a Welsh businessman who built an iron works at what is now Donetsk (then Yuzovka) in 1869–72, and developed the Donetsk coal deposits; and the Russian geologist Alexander Pol, who discovered the Kryvyi Rih iron ore in 1866, during archaeological research.\n\nThe Donetsk coal was necessary for smelting pig-iron from the Kryvyi Rih ore, producing a need for a railway to connect Yozovka with Kryvyi Rih. Permission to build the railway was given in 1881, and it opened in 1884. The railway crossed the Dnieper at Ekaterinoslav. The city grew quickly; new suburbs appeared: Amur, Nyzhnodniprovsk and the factory areas developed. In 1897, Ekaterinoslav became the third city in the Russian Empire to have electric trams. The Higher Mining School opened in 1899, and by 1913 it had grown into the Mining Institute.\n\nRussian defeat in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, among other things, resulted in widespread revolts against the government in many places of Russia, Ekaterinoslav being one of the major hot spots. Dozens of people were killed and hundreds wounded. There was a wave of anti-Semitic attacks.\n\nFrom 1902 to 1933, the historian of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, Dmytro Yavornytsky, was Director of the Dnipro Museum, which was later named after him. Before his death in 1940, Yavornytsky wrote a \"History of the City of Ekaterinoslav\", which lay in manuscript for many years. It was only published in 1989 as a result of the Gorbachev reforms.\n\nAfter the Russian February revolution in 1917, Ekaterinoslav became a city within autonomy of Ukrainian People's Republic under Tsentralna Rada government. In November 1917, the Bolsheviks led a rebellion and took power for a short time. On 5 April 1918 the German army took control of the city. And according to the February 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Central Powers it became part of the Ukrainian People's Republic. The city experienced occupation by German and Austrian-Hungarian armies that were allies of Ukrainian Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi and helped him to keep authority in the country.\n\nIn the time of the Ukrainian Directorate government, with its dictator Symon Petlura, the city had periods of uncertain power. At times the anarchists of Nestor Makhno held the city, and at others Denikin's Volunteer Army. Military operations of the Red Army, which came in from the North, captured the city in 1919, and despite attempts by Russian General Wrangel in 1920, he was unable to reach Yekaterinoslav. The War ended the following year.\n\nThe city was renamed after the Communist leader of Ukraine Grigory Petrovsky in 1926. Petrovsky was later involved in the organization of the Holodomor.\n\nDnipropetrovsk was under Nazi occupation from 17 August 1941 to 25 October 1943.\n\nAs early as July 1944, the State Committee of Defense in Moscow decided to build a large military machine-building factory in Dnipropetrovsk on the location of the pre-war aircraft plant. In December 1945, thousands of German prisoners of war began construction and built the first sections and shops in the new factory. This was the foundation of the Dnipropetrovsk Automobile Factory.\nJoseph Stalin suggested special secret training for highly qualified engineers and scientists to become rocket construction specialists.\n\nIn 1954 the administration of this automobile factory opened a secret design office with the name \"Southern\" (konstruktorskoe biuro Yuzhnoe – in Russian) to construct military missiles and rocket engines. Hundreds of talented physicists, engineers and machine designers moved from Moscow and other large cities in the Soviet Union to Dnipropetrovsk to join this \"Southern\" design office. In 1965, the secret Plant #586 was transferred to the Ministry of General Machine-Building of the USSR. The next year this plant officially changed its name to \"the Southern Machine-building Factory\" (Yuzhnyi mashino-stroitel’nyi zavod) or in abbreviated Russian, simply Yuzhmash.\n\nThe first \"General Constructor\" and head of the \"Southern\" design office was Mikhail Yangel, a prominent scientist and outstanding designer of space rockets, who managed not only the design office, but the entire factory from 1954 to 1971. Yangel designed the first powerful rockets and space military equipment for the Soviet Ministry of Defense.\n\nIn 1951 the Southern Machine-building Factory began manufacturing and testing new military rockets for the battlefield. The range of these first missiles was only . By 1959 Soviet scientists and engineers developed new technology, and as a result, the \"Southern\" design office (KBYu – as abbreviated in Russian) started a new machine-building project making ballistic missiles. Under the leadership of Yangel, KBYu produced such powerful rocket engines that the range of these ballistic missiles was practically without limits. During the 1960s, these powerful rocket engines were used as launch vehicles for the first Soviet space ships. During Makarov’s directorship, Yuzhmash designed and manufactured four generations of missile complexes of different types. These included space launch vehicles Kosmos, Tsyklon-2, Tsyklon-3 and Zenit. Under the leadership of Yangel’s successor, V. Utkin, the KBYu created a unique space-rocket system called Energia-Buran. Yuzhmash engineers manufactured 400 technical devices that were launched in artificial satellites (Sputniks). For the first time in the world space industry, the Dnipropetrovsk missile plant organised the serial production of space Sputniks. By the 1980s, this plant manufactured 67 different types of space ships, 12 space research complexes and 4 defense space rocket systems. \n\nThese systems were used not only for purely military purposes by the Ministry of Defense, but also for space research, for global radio and television networks, and for ecological monitoring. Yuzhmash initiated and sponsored the international space program of socialist countries, called Interkosmos. \n\nOn the eve of the collapse of the Soviet Union, KBYu had 9 regular and corresponding members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, 33 full professors and 290 scientists holding a Ph.D. They awarded scientific degrees and presided over a prestigious graduate school at KBYu, which attracted talented students of physics from all over the USSR. More than 50,000 people worked at Yuzhmash. At the end of the 1950s, Yuzhmash became the main Soviet design and manufacturing centre for different types of missile complexes. The Soviet Ministry of Defense included Yuzhmash in its strategic plans. The military rocket systems manufactured in Dnipropetrovsk became the major component of the newly born Soviet Missile Forces of Strategic Purpose. \n\nAccording to contemporaries, Yuzhmash was a separate entity inside the Soviet state. After a long period of competition with the Moscow centre of rocket construction of V. Chelomei (a successor of Koroliov) Yuzhmash rocket designs won in 1969. Since that time leaders of the Soviet military industrial complex preferred Yuzhmash rocket models. By the end of the 1970s, this plant became the major centre for designing, constructing, manufacturing, testing and deploying strategic and space missile complexes in the Soviet Union. The general designer and director of Yuzhmash supervised the work of numerous research institutes, design centres and factories all over the Soviet Union from Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev, to Voronezh and Yerevan. The Soviet state provided billions of Soviet rubles to finance Yuzhmash projects.\n\nOfficially, Yuzhmash manufactured agricultural tractors and special kitchen equipment for everyday needs, such as mincing-machines or juicers for civilian Soviet households. In official reports for the general audience there was no information about the production of rockets or spaceships. However, hundreds of thousands of workers and engineers in the city of Dnipropetrovsk worked in this plant and members of their families (up to 60% of the city population!) knew about the \"real production\" of Yuzhmash. This missile plant became a significant factor in the arms race of the Cold War. This is why the Soviet government approved of the KGB’s secrecy about Yuzhmash and its products. According to the Soviet government’s decision, the city of Dnipropetrovsk was officially closed to foreign visitors in 1959. No citizen of a foreign country (even of the socialist ones) was allowed to visit the city or district of Dnipropetrovsk. After the late 1950s ordinary Soviet people called Dnipropetrovsk \"the rocket closed city.\" Only during perestroika was Dnipropetrovsk opened to foreigners again in 1987.\n\nIn June 1990, the women’s department of Dnipropetrovsk preliminary prison was destroyed in prison riots. In the ten years that followed, women under investigation (i.e. not convicted) in Dnipropetrovsk oblast were either held in Preliminary Prison 4 in Kryvyi Rih or in \"detention blocks\" in Dnipropetrovsk; this contravened Ukrainian Law \"On preliminary incarceration\". Journeys from Kryviy Rih took up to six hours in special railway carriages with grated windows. Some prisoners had to do this 14 or 15 times. After complaints by the ombudsman (Nina Karpacheva) the head of the State prison department of Ukraine (Vladimir Levochkin) arranged that finances were given for the provision of women's cells in Dnipropetrovsk Preliminary Prison, making the lives of the 15,000 unconvicted women-detainees easier from August 2000.\n\nIn 2005, the most powerful representative of the \"Dnipropetrovsk Faction\" in Ukrainian politics was Leonid Kuchma, the former President of Ukraine and former senior manager of Yuzhmash.\n\nIn June and July 2007, Dnipropetrovsk experienced a wave of random serial killings that were dubbed by the media as the work of the \"Dnipropetrovsk maniacs\". In February 2009, three youths were sentenced for their part in 21 murders, and numerous other attacks and robberies.\n\nOn 27 April 2012, four bombs exploded near four tram stations in Dnipropetrovsk, injuring 26 people.\n\nDuring the 2014 Euromaidan regional state administration occupations protests against President Viktor Yanukovych were also held in Dnipropetrovsk. On 26 January, 3,000 anti-Yanukovych activists attempted to capture the local regional state administration building, but failed. This was mirrored by instances of rioting and the beating up of anti-Yanukovych protesters. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Kolesnikov called the anti-Yanukovych protesters 'extreme radical thugs from other regions'. Two days later about 2,000 public sector employees called an indefinite rally in support of the Yanukovych government. Meanwhile, the government building was reinforced with barbed wire. On 19 February 2014 there was an anti-Yanukovych picket near the Regional State Administration. On 22 February 2014 after another anti-Yanukovych picket near the Regional State Administration Dnipropetrovsk Mayor Ivan Kulichenko left Yanukovych's Party of Regions \"for peace in the city\". Simultaneously the Dnipropetrovsk City Council vowed to supports \"the preservation of Ukraine as a single and indivisible state\", although some members called for separatism and for federalization of Ukraine. The City Council also decided to rename city's Lenin Square into \"Heroes of Independence Square\". In the Regional State Administration building protesters dismantled Viktor Yanukovych portrait. 22 February 2014 was also the day that Yanukovych was ousted out of office, after violent events in Kiev.\n\nAccording to media reports, Dnipropetrovsk was relatively quiet during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, with pro-Russian Federation protestors outnumbered by those opposing outside intervention. In March 2014 the city's Lenin Square was renamed \"Heroes of Independence Square\" in honor of the people killed during Euromaidan. The statue of Lenin on the square was removed. In June 2014 another Lenin monument was removed and replaced by a monument to the Ukrainian military fighting the War in Donbass.\n\nIn order to comply with the 2015 decommunization law the city was renamed Dnipro in May 2016, after the river that flows through the city.\n\nThe City of Dnipro is governed by the Dnipro City Council. It is a city municipality that is designated as a separate district within its oblast.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into \"districts in city\" (\"raiony v misti\"). Presently, there are 8 of them. Aviatorske, an urban-type settlement located near the Dnipropetrovsk International Airport, is also a part of Dnipro Municipality.\n\nThe City Council Assembly makes up the administration's legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or rada. The municipal council is made up of 12 elected members, who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The current council was elected in 2015. The council has 29 standing commissions which play an important role in the oversight of the city and its merchants.\n\nDnipro has five single-mandate parliamentary constituencies entirely within the city, through which members of parliament (MPs) are elected to represent the city in Rada. At the last (2014) general election, were won by PPB and independent candidates with. In multimember districts city voted for Opposition Bloc, union of all political forces that did not endorse Euromaidan.\n\nIn the last decades the city has generally supported candidates belonging to the Party of Regions and (in the 1990s) Communist Party of Ukraine in national and local elections. There was the same situation in presidential elections, with strong support for Leonid Kuchma and Viktor Yanukovych. After the 2014 events of Euromaidan, which included mass demonstrations and clashes in the central city, Regions lost its influence, and Dnipropetrovsk supported Petro Poroshenko. In the 2015 Ukrainian local elections Borys Filatov of the patriotic UKROP was elected Mayor of Dnipro.\n\nDnipro is also the seat of the oblast's local administration controlled by the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Rada. The governor of the oblast is the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Rada speaker, appointed by the President of Ukraine.\n\n5 of the 8 city districts were renamed late November 2015 to comply with decommunization laws.\n\nThe city is built mainly upon both banks of the Dnieper, at its confluence with the Samara River. In the loop of a major meander, the Dnieper changes its course from the north west to continue southerly and later south-westerly through Ukraine, ultimately passing Kherson, where it finally flows into the Black Sea.\n\nNowadays both the north and south banks play home to a range of industrial enterprises and manufacturing plants. The airport is located about south-east of the city.\n\nThe centre of the city is constructed on the right bank which is part of the Dnieper Upland, while the left bank is part of the Dnieper Lowland. The old town is situated atop a hill that is formed as a result of the river's change of course to the south. The change of river's direction is caused by its proximity to the Azov Upland located southeast of the city.\n\nOne of the city's streets, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, links the two major architectural ensembles of the city and constitutes an important thoroughfare through the centre, which along with various suburban radial road systems, provides some of the area's most vital transport links for both suburban and inter-urban travel.\n\nUnder the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system, Dnipro has a hot-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfa\") with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. However, according to other schemes (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez bioclimatic one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and belongs to the Temperate xeric steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high evapotranspiration, Dnipro is in the transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") and a hot-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfa\"), with relatively drier summers than the rest of the year.\nDuring the summer, Dnipro is very warm (average day temperature in July is , even hot sometimes . Temperatures as high as have been recorded in May. Winter is not so cold (average day temperature in January is , but when there is no snow and the wind blows hard, it feels extremely cold. A mix of snow and rain happens usually in December.\n\nThe best time for visiting the city is in late spring — late April and May, and early in autumn: September, October, when the city's trees turn yellow. Other times are mainly dry with a few showers.\n\n\"However, the city is characterized with significant pollution of air with industrial emissions.\" The \"severely polluted air and water\" and allegedly \"vast areas of decimated landscape\" of Dnipro and Donetsk are considered by some to be an environmental crisis. Though exactly where in Dnipropetrovsk these areas might be found is not stated.\n\nDnipro is a primarily industrial city of around one million people; in being such it has developed into a large urban centre over the past few centuries to become, today, Ukraine's fourth-largest city.\nImmediately after its foundation, Dnipro, or as it was then known Yekaterinoslav, began to develop exclusively on the right bank of the Dnieper River. At first the city developed radially from the central point provided by the Transfiguration Cathedral. Neo-classical structures of brick and stone construction were preferred and the city began to take on the appearance of a typical European city of the era. Of these buildings many have been retained in the city's older Sobornyi District. Amongst the most important buildings of this era are the Transfiguration Cathedral, and a number of buildings in the area surrounding Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, including the Khrennikov House.\n\nOver the next few decades, until the October Revolution in 1917 the city did not change much in appearance and the predominant architectural style remained that of neo-classicism. Notable buildings built in the era preceding the Bolsheviks' rise to power and the establishment of communist Ukraine and later its absorption into the Soviet Union, include the main building of the National Mining University, which was built in 1899–1901, the art-nouveau inspired building of the city's former Duma, the Dnipropetrovsk National Historical Museum, and the Mechnikov Regional Hospital. Other buildings of the era that did not fit the typical architectural style of the time in Dnipropetrovsk include, the Ukrainian-influenced Grand Hotel Ukraine, the Russian revivalist style railway station (since reconstructed), and the art-nouveau Astoriya building on Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt.\nStalinist architecture (monumental soviet classicism) dominates in the city centre.\nOnce the bolsheviks had taken power in Dnipropetrovsk the city was gradually purged of tsarist-era monuments and monumental architecture was stripped of Imperial coats of arms and other non-socialist symbolism. In 1917, a monument to Catherine the Great that stood in front of the Mining Institute was replaced with one of Russian academic Mikhail Lomonosov. Later, due to damage from the Second World War, a number of large buildings were reconstructed. The main railway station, for example, was stripped of its Russian-revival ornamentation and redesigned in the style of Stalinist social-realism, whilst the Grand Hotel Ukraine survived the war but was later simplified much in design, with its roof being reconstructed in a typical French mansard style as opposed to the ornamental Ukrainian baroque of the pre-war era. Other badly damaged buildings were, more often than not, demolished completely and replaced with new structures. This is one of the main reasons why much of Dnipropetrovsk's central avenue, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, is designed in the style of Stalinist Social Realism. Many pre-revolution buildings were also reconstructed to suit new purposes. For example, the Emperor Nicholas II Commercial Institute in Dnipropetrovsk was reconstructed to serve as the administrative centre for the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a function it fulfils to this day. Other buildings, such as the Potemkin Palace were given over to the proletariat, in this case as the students' union of the Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin and appointment of Khrushchev, who had spent his early working years in Ukraine, as party secretary, the industrialisation of Dnipropetrovsk became even more profound, with the Southern (Yuzhne) Missile and Rocket factory being set up in the city. However, this was not the only development and many other factories, especially metallurgical and heavy-manufacturing plants, were set up in the city. At this point Dnipropetrovsk became one of the most important manufacturing cities in the Soviet Union, producing many goods from small articles like screws and vacuum cleaners to aircraft engine pieces and ballistic missiles. As a result of all this industrialisation the city's inner suburbs became increasingly polluted and were gradually given over to large, unsightly industrial enterprises. At the same time the extensive development of the city's left bank and western suburbs as new residential areas began. The low-rise tenant houses of the Khrushchev era (Khrushchyovkas) gave way to the construction of high-rise prefabricated apartment blocks (similar to German Plattenbaus). In 1976 in line with the city's 1926 renaming a large monumental statue of Grigoriy Petrovsky was placed on the square in front of the city's station. This statue was destroyed by an angry mob early 2016.\n\nTo this day the city is characterised by its mix of architectural styles, with much of the city's centre consisting of pre-revolutionary buildings in a variety of styles, stalinist buildings and constructivist architecture, whilst residential districts are, more often than not, made up of aesthetically simple, technically outdated mid-rise and high-rise housing stock from the Soviet era. Despite this, the city does have a large number of 'private sectors' were the tradition of building and maintaining individual detached housing has continued to this day. \n\nSince the independence of Ukraine in 1991 and the economic development that followed, a number of large commercial and business centres have been built in the city's outskirts.\nLate November 2015 about 300 streets, 5 of the 8 city districts and one metro station were renamed to comply with decommunization laws.\n\nThe population of the city is about 1 million people. In 2011, the average age of the city’s resident population was 40 years. The number of males declined slightly more than the number of females. The natural population growth in Dnipro is slightly higher than growth in Ukraine in general.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1933 the Ukrainian proportion of the population of Dnipropetrovsk increased from 16% to 48%. This was part of a national trend.\n\nIn a survey in June–July 2017, 63% of residents said that they spoke Russian at home, 9% spoke Ukrainian, and 25% spoke Ukrainian and Russian equally.\n\nThe same survey reported the following results for the religion of adult residents.\n\nDnipro is a major industrial centre of Ukraine. It has several facilities devoted to heavy industry that produce a wide range of products, including cast-iron, rolled metal, pipes, machinery, different mining combines, agricultural equipment, tractors, trolleybuses, refrigerators, different chemicals and many others. The most famous and the oldest (founded in the 19th century) is the Metallurgical Plant named after Petrovsky. The city also has big food processing and light industry factories. Many sewing and dress-making factories work for France, Canada, Germany and Great Britain , using the most advanced technologies, materials and design. Dnipro has also dominated in the aerospace industry since the 1950s; construction department Yuzhnoye Design Bureau and Yuzhmash are well known to the specialists all over the world.\n\nMetals and metallurgy is the city’s core industry in terms of output. Employment in the city is concentrated in large-sized enterprises. Metallurgical enterprises are based in the city and account for over 47% of its industrial output. These enterprises are important contributors to the city’s budget and, with 80% of their output being exported, to Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserve. Dnipro serves as the main import hub for foreign goods coming into the oblast and, on average, accounted for 58% of the oblast’s imports between 2005 and 2011. With economic conditions improving even further in 2010 and 2011, registered unemployment fell to about 4,100 by the end of 2011.\n\nDniproavia, an airline, has its head office on the grounds of Dnipropetrovsk International Airport. The main shareholder in the airline is Ukrainian-Israeli entrepreneur Ihor Kolomoyskyi's Privat Group, a global business group, based in the city and grouped around the Privatbank. Privat Group controls thousands of companies of virtually every industry in Ukraine, European Union, Georgia, Ghana, Russia, Romania, United States and other countries. Steel, oil & gas, chemical and energy are sectors of the group's prime influence and expertise. None of the group's capital is publicly traded on the stock exchange. Group's founding owners are natives of Dnipro and made their entire career here. Privatbank, the core of the group, is the largest commercial bank in Ukraine. In March 2014 was named by the American review Global Finance (magazine) as \"the Best Bank in Ukraine for 2014\" while British magazine \"The Banker\" in November 2013 named again the same bank as \"the Bank of the year 2013 in Ukraine\".\n\nPrivat Group is in business conflict with the Interpipe, also based in Dnipro area. The influential metallurgical mill company founded and mostly owned by the local business oligarch Viktor Pinchuk.\nOther company headquartered in Dnipro is ATB-Market. The company owns the largest national network of retail shops. The City of Dnipro’s economy is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, which accounted for 53% of the output of non-financial enterprises in 2010.\n\nThe main forms of public transport used in Dnipro are trams, buses, electric trolley buses and marshrutkas—private minibuses. In addition to this there are a large number of taxi firms operating in the city, and many residents have private cars.\n\nThe city's municipal roads also suffer from the same funding problems as the trams, with many of them in a very poor technical state. It is not uncommon to find very large potholes and crumbling surfaces on many of Dnipro's smaller roads. Major roads and highways are of better quality. In recent years the situation has, however, been improving, with a number of new used trams bought from the German cities of Dresden and Magdeburg, and a number of roads, including Schmidt Street and Moskovsky Street being reconstructed with modern road-building techniques.\nDnipro also has a metro system, opened in 1995, which consists of one line and 6 stations. Work on other stations was abandoned when the city ran out of money for this project; two of these abandoned building works are in the central portion of Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt. Completion of the next two stations is necessary to make the municipal subway system profitable. At the present time the completion date is unknown. the central portion of the city's metro line has seen renewed construction efforts and the metro has been transferred to municipal ownership in the hope that this will help it secure a loan from the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction. Current plans envision the three station section from Teatralna, through Tsentralna, to Muzeina completed by 2015.\n\nDnipro has some highways crossing through the city. The most popular routes are from Kiev, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhia. Transit through the city is also available. the city is also seeing construction of a southern urban bypass, which will allow automobile traffic to proceed around the city centre. This is expected to both improve air quality and reduce transport issues from heavy freight lorries that pass through the city centre. \n\nThe largest bus station in eastern Ukraine is located in Dnipro, from where bus routes are available to all over the country, including some international routes to Russia, Poland, Germany, Moldova and Turkey. It is located near the city's central railway station.\n\nIn the summertime, there are some routes available by hydrofoils on the Dnieper River, whilst various tourist ships on their way down the river, (Kiev–Kherson–Odessa) tend to make a stop in the city. Dnipro's river port is located close to the area surrounding the central railway station, on the banks of the river. It is a good example of constructivist architecture from the late period of the Soviet Union. \n\nThe city is a large railway junction, with many daily trains running to and from Eastern Europe and on domestic routes within Ukraine.\n\nThere are two railway terminals, Dnipro Holovnyi (main station) and Dnipro Lotsmanska (south station).\n\nTwo express passenger services run each day between Kiev and Dnipro under the name 'Capital Express'. Other daytime services include suburban trains to towns and villages in the surrounding Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Most long-distance trains tend to run at night to reduce the amount of daytime hours spent travelling by each passenger.\n\nDomestic connections exist between Dnipro and Kiev, Lviv, Simferopol, Odessa, Ivano-Frankivsk, Truskavets, Donetsk, Kharkiv and many other smaller Ukrainian cities, whilst international destinations include, amongst others, Minsk in Belarus, Moscow's Kursky Station and Saint Petersburg's Vitebsky Station in Russia, Baku – the capital of Azerbaijan, and the Bulgarian seaside resort of Varna.\n\nThe city is served by Dnipropetrovsk International Airport and is connected to European and Middle Eastern cities with daily flights. It is located southeast from the city center.\n\nThe city has a river port located on the left bank of the Dnieper. There is also a railroad freight station.\n\nThere are 163 educational institutions among them schools, gymnasiums and boarding schools. For children of pre-school age there are 174 institutions, also a lot of out-of -school institutions such as center of out-of-school work. 87 institutions that are recognized on all Ukrainian and regional levels.\n\nIn a survey in June–July 2017, adult respondents reported the following educational levels:\n\nIn 2006 Dnipropetrovsk hosted the All-Ukrainian Olympiad in Information Technology; in 2008, that for Mathematics, and in 2009 the semi-final of the All-Ukrainian Olympiad in Programming for the Eastern Region. In the same year as the latter took place, the youth group 'Eksperiment', an organisation promoting increased cultural awareness amongst Ukrainians, was founded in the city.\n\nDnipro is a major educational centre in Ukraine and is home to two of Ukraine's top-ten universities; the Oles Honchar Dnipro National University and National Mining University.\nThe system of high education institutions connects 38 institutions in Dnipro, among them 14 of IV and ІІІ levels of accreditation, and 22 of І and ІІ levels of accreditation. In year 2012 National Mining Institute was on the 7th and Dnipropetrovsk National University named after O. Honchar was on the 9th place among the best high education institutions in \"TOP-200 Ukraine\" list.\n\nThe list below is a list of all current state-organised higher educational institutions (not included are non-independent subdivisions of other universities not based in Dnipro).\nCurrently around 55, 000 students study in Dnipro, a significant number of whom are students from abroad.\n\nThe city has a variety of theatres (plus an Opera) and museums of interest to tourists, including the Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum. There are also several parks, restaurants and beaches.\n\nThe major streets of the city were renamed in honour of Marxist heroes during the Soviet era. Following the 2015 law on decommunization these have been renamed.\n\nThe central thoroughfare is known as Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, a, wide and long boulevard that stretches east to west through the centre of the city. It was founded in the 18th century and parts of its buildings are the actual decoration of the city. In the heart of the city is Soborna Square, which includes the majestic cathedral founded by order of Catherine the Great in 1787. \n\nOn the square, there are some remarkable buildings: the Museum of History, Diorama \"Battle for the Dnieper River (World War II)\", and also the park in which one can rest in the hot summer. Walking down the hill to the Dnieper River, one arrives in the large Taras Shevchenko Park (which is on the right bank of the river) and on Monastyrsky Island. This island is one of the most interesting places in the city. In the 9th century, the Byzantine monks based a monastery here. \n\nA few areas retain their historical character: all of Central Avenue, some street-blocks on the main hill (the Nagorna part) between Pushkin Prospekt and Embankment, and sections near Globa (formerly known as Chkalov park until it was recently renamed) and Shevchenko parks have been untouched for 150 years. \n\nThe Dnieper River keeps the climate mild. It is visible from many points in Dnipro. From any of the three hills in the city, one can see a view of the river, islands, parks, outskirts, river banks and other hills.\n\nThere was no need to build skyscrapers in the city in Soviet times. The major industries preferred to locate their offices close to their factories and away from the centre of town. Most new office buildings are built in the same architectural style as the old buildings. A number, however, display more modern aesthetics, and some blend the two styles.\n\nFC Dnipro football club, play in the Ukrainian Premier League and UEFA Europa League, and are the only Soviet team to win the USSR Federation Cup twice. The club is owned by the Privat Group. Note: A bandy team, a basketball team and others use the same name.\n\nOther local football include: FC Lokomotyv Dnipropetrovsk and FC Spartak Dnipropetrovsk, both of which have large fan bases.\n\nRecently the city built a new soccer stadium; the Dnipro-Arena has a capacity of 31,003 people and was built as a replacement for Dnipro's old stadium, Stadium Meteor. The Dnipro-Arena hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification game between Ukraine and England on 10 October 2009. The Dnipro Arena was initially chosen as one of the Ukrainian venues for their joint Euro 2012 bid with Poland. However it was dropped from the list in May 2009 as the capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by UEFA.\n\nThe city is the centre of Ukrainian bandy. The Ukrainian Federation of Bandy and Rink-Bandy has its office in the city. The foremost local bandy club is Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, which won the Ukrainian championship in 2014.\n\n\nSee also List of mayors and political chiefs of the Dnipro city administration.\n\nThe city of Dnipro is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

Ehrman. Although it has long been recognised that numerous Epistles of the New Testament bear names of authors who are unlikely to have written them, traditional Christian teaching has been that it was an accepted practice in antiquity for a writer to attribute his work to a well-known figure from the past, or a teacher who has greatly influenced him. \"Forged\" demonstrates that this is incorrect and the practice would have been condemned as dishonest by all authorities in antiquity. Falsely attributed writings are often referred to as \"pseudepigraphs\" but Ehrman maintains that the more honest term is \"forgery\". The book posits that 11 or more books out of the 27 books of the Christian New Testament canon were written as forgeries. In his book, Ehrman points out numerous inconsistencies which he finds within the New Testament which appear to support many of his claims, such as the fact that in Acts 4:13 the statement is made that both Peter and John were illiterate, yet in later years entire books of the Bible were then alleged to have been written by them.\n\n\nIn addition to the eleven books of the New Testament Ehrman identifies as forgeries, there are eight originally anonymous New Testament texts that had names of apostles ascribed to them later and are falsely attributed.

South America is home to more than 280,000 Guaraní people, 51,000 of whom reside in Brazil. The Guaraní people inhabit regions in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, as well as Argentina. There are more than four million speakers of Guaraní across these regions.\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) classified Guaraní’s language vitality as “vulnerable”. UNESCO’s definition of “vulnerable” is meant to highlight that although the majority of Guaraní children can speak Guaraní, the use of the language is restricted to particular contexts (e.g., familial settings). Although the Guaraní language may only be classified as “vulnerable,” there are other languages within the Tupí-Guaraní branch that are classified as “extinct” and “critically endangered” (e.g., Amanayé and Anambé respectively).\n\nThe Guaraní language has been an object of study since the arrival of the Jesuits in the seventeenth century. The Guaraní language is a subgroup within the Tupí-Guaraní branch. There are three dialects within the Guaraní subgroup: Mbyá, Kaiowá and Ñandeva. The differences among the three dialects of the Guaraní language can be noted primarily in their distinct phonologies and syntax, as these vary depending on the social context that the language is being used. Of note, the Mbyá prioritize oral transmission. Literacy within the Mbyá received an increased level of importance in the late 1990s as a product of new educational institutions in the villages. Lemle (1971) contends that in spite of their being almost forty dialects within the Tupí-Guaraní family, there exist numerous similarities between the words of these dialects.\n\n\nThese share some degree of mutual intelligibility and are close to being dialects; however, Chiripá is reported to be intelligible due to bilingualism, not inherently. Also, there is a degree of intelligibility with Kaiwá–Pai Tavytera, which is not included in the \"Ethnologue\". \"Ethnologue\" considers Tapieté to be a separate language, intermediate between Eastern Bolivian and Paraguayan, and has shifted from the name Chiripá to Avá, though the latter is ambiguous. Paraguayan Guarani is by far the most widely spoken variety and is what is often meant by the term \"Guarani\" outside South America.\n\nThe Tupí-Guaraní branch within the Tupí family that has been the object of most linguistic studies within this family. As a result, the linguistic literature available on Tupí-Guaraní languages is extensive, ranging from grammars, bibliographies, histories of language development, typological studies, to dissertations on the phonology of the Guaraní language.\n\nAccording to Silvetti and Silvestri (2015), Guaraní only came to be a written language following the arrival of the Jesuits. Silvetti and Silvestri propound that “it was the Jesuits who gave it a grammar and a syntax and made it into one of the ‘\"lenguas generales’\" used for the evangelization of the natives”.\n\nIn light of this, we will highlight important literary works on Guaraní linguistics of three Jesuits, namely: (i) Jesuit Joseph de Anchieta; (ii) Jesuit Antonio Ruiz de Montoya; and lastly, (iii) Jesuit Alonson de Aragona. The first Guaraní grammar written was that of Jesuit Joseph de Anchieta (1595). Ringmacher contends, however, that Jesuit Antonio Ruiz de Montoya’s \"Arte de la lengua Guaraní\" (1640), a documentation of Guaraní grammar, served as a significant point of reference and departure for all proceeding grammatical works concerning the Guaraní language. Montoya’s analysis of the Guaraní morphology and syntax stands accurate until this day. Montoya also produced a Guaraní dictionary known as \"Tesoro de la Lengua Guaraní\" (1639). In this work, he not only created the first dictionary of this kind, but also provided examples of contexts in which to use the various words he documented. Lastly, Jesuit Alonson de Aragona produced a pedagogical grammar that was completed in 1629, but only printed in 1979. The intention of Aragona’s work was to help those seeking ways to learn Guaraní.\n\nThe extensive research conducted as well as the expansive reach of the Guaraní language across Latin America has granted it an important position in the urban landscape. In other words, Guaraní’s official status in Paraguay combined with research studies that have followed has allowed for recent projects of standardization.\n\nAs efforts move forward to standardize Guaraní, the expansion of its use across sectors in Latin America will only increase. This can be seen with the broad expanse of literature being developed on the structure of Guaraní language, as well as its cultural importance. One of the key proponents in this venture, other than the Guaraní themselves, is academic Robert A. Dooley. Dooley has made an extensive collection of works of the language through his career, usually based around the discourse of the Guaraní-Mbyá language structure. Examples being on how different grammatical structures are understood by the speaker, can completely shift the narrative being shared, or the focus on the pragmatic structuring of Guaraní sentences, clause chaining, or spatial understandings of Guaraní. These research projects done by Dooley are crucial to understanding different cultural aspects, like discourses in relation to translating important religious factors which in turn are important for empowering the Guaraní themselves. This standardization is also supported by academics like Guillaume Thomas, who through examining Guaraní can differentiate between temporal suffixes and as such different tenses, and who through examining differing degrees of nominalization, is able to compare different variants of Guaraní-Mbyá between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, in turn creating a type of database of difference that can be used for reference for the different language styles. Works such as these, and the work of scholars like Estigarribia and Pinta (2017) that compiles recent studies on the Guaraní will become of increasing relevance.\n\nParaguayan Guarani, is, alongside Spanish, one of the official languages of Paraguay. Paraguay's constitution is bilingual, and its state-produced textbooks are typically half in Spanish and half in Guarani.\n\nSpeakers of Guarani who are not fluent in any other language have markedly limited opportunities for education and employment. There are very few speakers of Guarani outside South America. Those few that exist include emigrants, scholars, missionaries, and former volunteers of the Peace Corps.\n\nA variety of Guarani known as Chiripá is also spoken in Paraguay. It is closely related to Paraguayan Guarani, a language which speakers are increasingly switching to. There are 7,000 speakers of Chiripá in Paraguay.\n\nAdditionally, another variety of Guarani known as Mbyá is also spoken in Paraguay by 8,000 speakers. Lexically, it is 75% similar to Paraguayan Guarani.\n\nThe smallest Guarani speaking community in Paraguay is that of the Aché, also known as Guayaki, with a population of 850.\n\nFinally, in the Paraguayan Chaco Department, there are 304 speakers of Eastern Bolivian/Western Argentine Guarani, known locally as Ñandeva or Tapiete. (However, outside Paraguay, Ñandeva refers to Chiripá.)\n\nThe largest Guarani group in the Chaco is that known locally as Guarayo who settled in Paraguay after the war with Bolivia (1932–35). They are originally from the Isoso area of Bolivia.\n\nParaguayan Guarani is an official language in the province of Corrientes, alongside Spanish.\n\nA different variety of Guarani, Western Argentine Guarani, is spoken further west by about 15,000 speakers, mostly in Jujuy, but also in Salta Province. It refers essentially to the same variety of Guarani as Eastern Bolivian Guarani.\n\nAdditionally, another variety of Guarani known as Mbyá is spoken in Argentina by 3,000 speakers.\n\nEastern Bolivian Guarani and Western Bolivian Guarani are widely spoken in the southeastern provinces of the country.\n\nEastern Bolivian Guarani, also known as Chawuncu or Chiriguano, is spoken in by 33,670 speakers (or 36,917) in the south-central Parapeti River area and in the city of Tarija. It refers to essentially the same variety of Guarani as Western Argentine Guarani.\n\nOther Guarani groups that exist are the Gwarayú or Guarayos around 30,000, and Sirionó some 800 in Santa Cruz. What remains of the Yuki population estimated at around 240 live in the Dpt. of Cochabamba.\n\nIn August 2009 Bolivia launched a Guarani-language university at Kuruyuki in the southeastern province of Chuquisaca which will bear the name of indigenous hero Apiaguaiki Tumpa.\n\nThe expansive territory of the Guaraní encompasses a space that traverses the Brazilian, Paraguayan, Argentinian and Uruguayan borders. There are various points of tension in the history of the Guaraní, but this analysis will prioritize three: (i) the arrival of the Jesuits; (ii) the exploitative labour practices of the \"encomiendas\"; and finally, (iii) the expropriation of Guaraní land by the Spanish and Portuguese colonizers.\nThe arrival of the Jesuits to Guaraní territory in the seventeenth century resulted in a re-organization of the social, political and economic structures of the Guaraní peoples. The communities (commonly referred to as “missions”) that the Jesuits established amassed a total population that surpassed 100 000 Guaraní peoples. The subjugation of the Guaraní people to one social, economic, political, and spiritual order in the missions contributed to a false construction of the Guaraní as a homogeneous people. Wilde articulated it well in his assertion that:The missions constituted an “imagined community” that over the course of 150 years incorporated very diverse populations that had to adapt to a single pattern of spatial and temporal organization.Initially, the Spaniards recognized the differences amongst the indigenous people of the Guaraní territory; yet, Spanish documentation failed to adequately recognize this diversity.\n\nThe Guaraní were not only subjected to regimented living conditions by the Europeans, but they were also manipulated through exploitative labour practices. The Guaraní were victims of exploitation by both the \"encomenderos\" of the Spanish territories as well as by the slave traders of the south of Brazil. Ecomenderos were the recipients of an encomienda. An encomienda was a grant from the crown that allowed specific officials the control over certain indigenous populations with the intention of extracting labour. In other words, Encomenderos granted Guaraní people work in exchange for “protection,” but for the most part, this work arrangement merely facilitated an institutionalized exploitation of labour of the Guaraní people.\n\nAfter the signing of the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, the Guaraní fought for the rights to their territory in a war lasting from 1754 until 1756. This treaty mandated the displacement of numerous Guaraní people living in areas controlled by the Spanish monarchy. The treaty granted the Portuguese monarchy the rights to specific areas previously under Spanish control. The Portuguese complied with the treaty with the condition that the Guaraní people would be removed. In other words, in spite of the Guaraní being central to the stipulations of the treaty, they were completely absent from negotiation processes. The treaty was not upheld after 1761. As a result, the only purpose the treaty fulfilled was the displacement and death of numerous Guaraní people and the destruction of their communities. The Jesuits were expelled from the Guaraní territory in 1767, in part, because of their supposed assistance to the Guaraní in efforts to defend their rights to their territory.\n\nIn 2014, Brazil’s Institute of National Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) officially recognized Guaraní-Mbyá as being of cultural significance in Brazilian history. This decision was the product of a pilot project that researched the number of speakers of the language in conjunction with other important indicators. There project was administered by the Political Linguistics Research and Development Institute (IPOL) who conducted research in more than 60 communities, documenting how the speakers defined, transmitted and used their language in daily life. At the end of this project, the findings were published in digital and text format and presented at a conference. The conference afforded the Guaraní an opportunity to express their endorsement of Guaraní-Mbyá being recognized as a cultural reference point in Brazilian history. Additionally, national recognition of the importance of this language granted the public the possibility of re-considering the important value of the Guaraní people to Brazilian history. It also provided the Guaraní an opportunity to develop stronger feelings of autonomy and agency with regard to their own cultural identities.\n\nIn 2009 \"The Guaraní Project\" began to be developed in the Documentation Project on Indigenous Culture (PRODOCULT) by the Museu do Indio with funding support from UNESCO and the Banco do Brasil foundation. The purpose of this project is to firstly document Guaraní culture through the words and actions of the Guaraní themselves, as well as aid in indigenous agency and independence through teaching them methodologies for documenting their culture, so they can ultimately tell their own cultural histories. The first phase of this project, and its base purpose, is to train young peoples from five separate Guaraní-Mbyá villages in the southern coasts of Rio de Janeiro in documenting and inventorying both material and non-material culture that they deem to be relevant to themselves in the present day, and their past cultural histories. The other phases of this project aim to introduce those residing in these villages to the process of micro-informatics, and other ways of documenting culture such as through photography.\n\n\"Guarani Consonants\"\n\n\"Note\".

Suarez.\n\nGuarani interrogative pronouns have the same person and non-person distinction as negative pronouns.\n\nInflection or inflectional affixes, are the changes in a word to mark differentiations in tense, person, mood, voice, case, and number of speakers. Inflectional affixes can be in turn divided into seven different components.\n\nFirstly, there are inflections of \"personal reference\", which can connect to the speaker, addressee, or neither.\n\nSecondly, there is \"subject reference\", which is the inflection that relates to the subject of a conversation, which follow the same structures as personal reference.\n\nThird, there is \"object reference\", which is the inflection used when connecting a person to an object.\n\nThe \"reflexive inflection\" within Guarani holds a specific morpheme, that being ‘ye-’. ‘Ye-’ stems together with the morpheme for a subject in a sentence, and is the indicator of whether the subject is the individual undergoing an action, or is the actor themselves.\n\n\"Reciprocal inflection\" holds the specific morpheme ‘yo-’, which similar to the morpheme for reflexive inflection combines with the subject of a sentence, specifically in third person or plural morphemes.\n\nThe morpheme for \"desiderative inflection\", ‘ta-’. As in the other examples mentioned prior, this morpheme stems together with the subject in a sentence for indicating someone’s wish, permission, command, etc.\n\nThe \"commanding inflection\" represents itself in Guarani with the morpheme ‘e-’, which occurs with verbal stems for the purpose of indicating second person singular command.\n\nGuarani is an active-stative language. In other words, Guarani consists of active transitive verbs as well as both active and stative intransitive verbs. To indicate the subject, active verbs use prefixes. In stative verbs, with the exception of the third person case, the subjects are not marked by prefixes, but by subject pronouns that operate independently and not as suffixes. It is also worth noting that in Guarani, first person plural can be both inclusive and exclusive.\n\n\"Guarani Active and Stative Verbs\"\n\n\"Note\". Chart above reprinted from A. Gutman and B. Avanzati.\n\n\"Note.\" Chart above reprinted from B. Estigarribia and J. Pinta\n\nIn Guarani, valency increases occur by modifying the predicates in either valency 1 or valency 2 to the consecutive valency (i.e. valency 2 and 3 respectively for valency 1 and valency 2) (as cited in Estigarribia & Pinta, p. 50).\n\nIn Guarani, the \"causative voice\" is the only voice with the power to increase valency. For example, in the case of intransitive verbs, the causative voice can be observed by the prefix \"mbo-/mo-\". \n\n\"Note.\" Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.\n\nThe prefixes of the causative voice have the flexibility of functioning as derivational morphemes. \n\n\"Note.\" Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.\n\nIn the case of transitive clauses, the causative morpheme \"–uka\" is used. \n\n\"Note\". Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.\n\nIn contrast to valency-increasing mechanisms, valency-decreasing mechanisms modify predicates so as to transform valency 2 and 3 to lower valencies. There are three valency-decreasing voices, they are: middle, reciprocal, and anti-passive.\n\nThe prefix je-/ñe- is used in the middle voice. The middle voice is utilized in contexts expressing passive and reflexive scenarios. \n\n\"Note\". Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.\n\nThe prefix jo-/ño- indicates that a reciprocal voice is being used. In reciprocal voice, the participants of the clause are both the agent and the patient of one another. \n\n\"Note\". Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.\n\nThe anti-passive voice can be identified through the prefix \"poro-\" and the prefix \"–mba’e\". The prefix \"“poro-”\" is utilized in association with human objects and \"“mba’e-”\" is used in contexts where inanimate as well as non-human subjects are present. In contrast to the passive middle voice, the anti-passive voice detransivitizes the patient in the transitive clause as opposed to detransitivizing the agent. \n\n\"Note\". Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.\n\nIn grammar, tense can be defined as a grammatical tool that is used to refer to the time frame in connection to the moment of speaking, with the purpose being to express a specific difference in time in connection to a topic or the speaker. Nominal tense can be defined as an action that is true to an individual in a particular point in time, e.g “Yesterday, a student knitted’ in which the morphological marker for past tense in English, \"-ed\", is attached to the action made by the student individual.\n\nIn Guarani, however, verbs are often left unmarked for tense. Instead, the present is left without any type of tense marker or morpheme connected to it indicating it is present. As such, verbs falling under present tense can have relative flexibility in connection to temporality. In other words, verbs in the present tense have the flexibility of also meaning remote past or near future These are known as bare verbs, and refer to events that occur at the time of or shortly before the time of speaking. These sentences can only ever properly be used to answer questions in relation to the past, or in connection to the present, but never about the future.\n\nJuan o-mba’eapo vaipa Juan 3-wrk a.lot ‘Juan is working/was working/worked a lot A relative clause, or a clause used to define the preceding noun are formed with the particle va’e, which can in turn be combined with past and future morphemes to create different matrixes, as can be seen in examples below. E-me’ẽ kyche mesa py o-ĩ va’e IMP-give knife table on 3-be REL ‘Give me the knife that’s on the table.’ To connect to tense that is past oriented, the morpheme suffix –kue is used. Translated roughly into English, -kue signifies the ‘ex’ of something, as can be seen in the example below, or as something that exists only in the former. Sometimes -kue can be represented by the allomorph -gue.\n\nA-echa mburuvicha-kue 1-see leader-PAST ‘I saw the ex-leader’ The matrix of this term occurs when the relative clause va’e combines with -kue forming, va’ekue. Va’kue can be found in sentences that directly describe past events, or as a connecting anchor to a time before the past event being referenced by the speaker. A-mba’eapo va’e-kue 1-work REL-PST ‘I worked/was working.’ In order to connect to future events, the morpheme suffix –rã is used. In English, - rã translates to meaning ‘future’, and it signifies the ‘future’ of something, as can be seen in the example below, or as something that only exists within the future.\n\nKuee, a-jogua che-ro-rã Yesterday, 1-buy 1-house-FUT ‘Yesterday, I bought my (future) house.’ Similar to va’ekue, when the relative clause va’e combines with -rã, the morpheme suffix va’erã is formed. Va’erã is used to express a connection to broader future ties, and it can be found in sentences that describe directly future events.\n\nGuaimi vy, Maria o-menda va-erã peteĩ ava o-guereko-pa va’e reve Female.adult SS, Maria 3-marry REL-FUT one man 3-have-all REL with ‘When she is an adult, Maria will marry a man who is rich.’. \n\nGuarani temporal markers are only productive with indefinites, possessives, demonstratives, and qualification in nominal phrases. Depending on the clarification of the phrase they are in, they may or may not be applicable, as is represented in the chart below. Through analyzing this chart, one can see that \"-kue\" is not applicable to artifacts of a food or natural origin, and that \"-kue\" is also not applicable when combined with nouns that represent permeant relations.\n\"Note\".

The film tells a fictional story in which the real life Chilean poet Pablo Neruda forms a relationship with a simple postman who learns to love poetry. It stars Philippe Noiret, Massimo Troisi, and Maria Grazia Cucinotta. The screenplay was adapted by Anna Pavignano, Michael Radford, Furio Scarpelli, Giacomo Scarpelli, and Massimo Troisi from the novel \"Ardiente paciencia\" by Antonio Skármeta. In 1983, Skármeta himself wrote and directed the film \"Ardiente paciencia\" (English translation: \"Burning Patience\"), which he later adapted to the novel of the same name in 1985.\n\nWriter/star Massimo Troisi postponed heart surgery so that he could complete the film. The day after filming was completed, he suffered a fatal heart attack.\n\nSet in the year 1950, Pablo Neruda, the famous Chilean poet, is exiled to a small island in Italy for political reasons. His wife accompanies him. On the island, a local, Mario Ruoppolo, is dissatisfied with being a fisherman, like his father. Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail (the island has no cars). Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry.\n\nMeanwhile, Mario falls in love with a beautiful young lady, Beatrice Russo, who works in her aunt's village cafe. He is shy with her, but he enlists Neruda's help. Mario constantly asks Neruda if particular metaphors that he uses are suitable for his poems. Mario is able to better communicate with Beatrice and express his love through poetry. Despite the aunt's strong disapproval of Mario, because of his sensual poetry (which turns out to be largely stolen from Neruda), Beatrice responds favourably.\n\nThe two are married. The priest refuses to allow Mario to have Neruda as his best man because of politics; however, this is soon resolved. This was because Di Cosimo was the politician in office in the area with the Christian Democrats. At the wedding, Neruda receives the welcome news that there is no longer a Chilean warrant for his arrest so he returns to Chile.\n\nMario writes a letter but never gets any reply. Several months later, he receives a letter from Neruda. However, to his dismay, it is actually from his secretary, asking Mario to send Neruda's old belongings back to Chile. While there Mario comes upon an old phonograph and listens to the song he first heard when he met Neruda. Moved, he makes recordings of all the beautiful sounds on the island onto a cassette including the heartbeat of his soon-to-be-born child.\n\nFive years later, Neruda finds Beatrice and her son, Pablito (named in honour of Neruda) in the same old inn. From her, he discovers that Mario had been killed before their son was born. Mario had been scheduled to recite a poem he had composed at a large communist gathering in Naples; the demonstration was violently broken up by the police. She gives Neruda recordings of village sounds that Mario had made for him. The film ends with Neruda walking in the beach he used to talk with Mario, showing at the same time the communist gathering in which Mario was killed.\n\n\nWhereas the novel and the 1985 film were set in Chile, with Neruda living in his home at Isla Negra around 1970, \"Il Postino: The Postman\" moves the setting to Italy in about 1950. The film is set and was filmed on the island of Procida, gulf of Naples; some additional filming took place on Salina, one of the volcanic Aeolian Islands that form an archipelago off the northern coast of Sicily.\n\nCorricella is the setting for some of the waterfront scenes in the movie.\n\nIn 1994 to promote the film, Miramax published \"The Postman (Il Postino): Music From The Miramax Motion Picture\", which besides the film's score, composed by Luis Enríquez Bacalov, includes Neruda's poems recited by many celebrities. There are a total of 31 tracks.\n\nIn 2002 CAM Original Soundtracks released a 17 track version of the score (CAM 509536-2) which was mastered in Dolby Surround.\n\nThe album won the Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.\n\nFor the 2010 opera based on the film see Daniel Catan.\n\nThe film was very well received. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of the critics liked the film, based on 26 reviews. It received a score of 81 on Metacritic, indicating \"Universal Acclaim\", based on 13 critic reviews.\n\nAt the 68th Academy Awards (1995), \"Il Postino: The Postman\" received five nominations and one Academy Award.\n\n\nTroisi received posthumous Academy Award nominations for Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay.

Its work seeks especially to highlight the contribution of Afroasiatic peoples to world civilization, in general, and Western culture, in particular. It was founded in Princeton in 1984 and then incorporated in 1985 and is currently directed by Ephraim Isaac a Harvard trained scholar and peace activist. The Institute also releases a bi-annual linguistically focused international scholarly journal entitled the Journal of Afroasiatic Languages (JAAL) published by the Red Sea Press. In addition to its academic journal, it also recently launched an academic monograph series called Afroasiatic Studies in collaboration with the Red Sea Press. The Institute of Semitic Studies is the first independent research institute that focuses on Semitic and Afroasiatic studies within the United States.\n\nAmong the Institute’s major achievements to date is the sponsorship of the 1989 symposium on the Dead Sea Scrolls. According to the Institute's website, \"This symposium was editorialized in the Washington Post as a commendable peace-making effort among bitterly quarreling scholars.\". In 1992, the Institute sponsored the Second International Congress of \"Yemenite Jewish Studies\" where the Congress brought together over 200 scholars and many interested individuals from Israel, Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. A congratulatory message was given by the future US President Bill Clinton and the then Prime Minister Shamir of Israel. Also, the Institute supports a Princeton Theological Seminary project to make the Dead Sea Scrolls publicly available in their original Hebrew and/or Aramaic, with new English translations. It supports the University of Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary Project. In 1988, it co-sponsored with the Univ. of Pennsylvania the 35th International Congress of Assyriology. In 1991, it co-sponsored with Princeton University the Fifth Congress of Judaeo-Arabic Studies and another on Ancient Iraq. It has organized other major scholarly projects and frequent public and educational programs. Among these are those on the Nabataeans, religions of pre-Islamic Arabia, and Ethiopic Christian manuscripts.\n\nThe Institute has collaborated with Princeton University, Princeton Theological Seminary, the University of Pennsylvania, the New York Bar Association, the Israeli Association for Society and Culture, as well as Pennsylvania Governor’s Cultural Affairs Department, the University of the Arts, Please Touch Me Museum, the Woodrow Wilson Institute, and many others.\n\nSupport for the work of the Institute has come from various sources, but most notably the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the New Jersey Committee for the Humanities, the New York Committee for the Humanities, Bristol Myers Co, Blum Foundation, Lawrence Gelb Foundation, New York City Central Labor Council: AFL-CIO, State of Ben L. Burman, H. J. Stich Foundation, JDC, and many generous individuals all over the US.\n\nEven in its first years of establishment, the work of the Institute of Semitic Studies had caught national and international attention. In a little less than a decade, its work was reported in five front-page newspaper stories (New York Times, 3; Trenton Times, 2), and its role discussed in one major editorial (Washington Post). Stories about the work of the Institute have been featured in the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Christian Science Monitor, and several local, national, and international papers and other media including the BBC.\n\nThe Institute’s mission is to promote the unique and rich contributions of Semitic and Afroasiatic culture and language to world civilization through rigorous academic research. As an integral part of its mission, however, it also seeks to integrate its scholarship with peace-building efforts in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East through the promotion of mutual understanding of common cultural and linguistic heritages. The institute is planning to build an African Peace Center in Princeton which would be to dedicated academic peace-building research and conflict mediation for conflict ridden regions in Africa.\n\n"}

Baumgarten (Vienna, September 7, 1928 – December 4, 2008) was a Semitic scholar known for his knowledge in the field of Jewish legal texts from biblical law to Mishnaic law and including the legal texts among the Dead Sea Scrolls. \nBaumgarten immigrated to the United States with his family in 1939 as a result of the Anschluss, Germany's occupation of Austria in 1938. In 1950, he was ordained a rabbi at Mesivta Torah Vodaath, a prominent Brooklyn yeshiva. He married Naomi Rosenberg in 1953.\n\nBaumgarten started his studies in the field of mathematics with a B.A. cum laude from Brooklyn College. It was a chance meeting at Johns Hopkins with William Foxwell Albright that caused him to change direction, eventually being awarded a Ph.D. in Semitic studies in 1954. His dissertation was entitled \"The Covenant Sect and the Essenes.\" From 1952 to 1957 he remained at Johns Hopkins teaching Aramaic. In 1953 he began his long association with Baltimore Hebrew College. He also took on the role of rabbi to the Bnai Jacob Congregation in 1959. Throughout his life he was a member of the Rabbinical Council of America, a major organization of Orthodox rabbis.\n\nProf. Baumgarten served as visiting professor at Towson State College, University of Maryland, and the University of the Negev (now Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) in Israel. He was also in residence at the Institute for Advanced Studies of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1990 and again in 2001. He was a fellow at the Annenberg Institute (now the Center for Judaic Studies of the University of Pennsylvania) in Philadelphia in 1992-93.\n\n1953 saw the first of his publications on the Dead Sea Scrolls. Essays from the early period of his study were collected in 1977, \"Studies in Qumran Law\" (Leiden: Brill, 1977). His knowledge of Qumran legal matters was probably the reason why John Strugnell gave him the task of publishing the Cave 4 fragments of the Damascus Document. His work on the Damascus Document not only brought its manuscripts to publication but provided the basis for understanding it within the framework of the history of Judaism.\n\nA festschrift was presented to him in 1995: \"Legal Texts and Legal Issues, Proceedings of the Second Meeting of the International Organization for Qumran Studies, Cambridge 1995, Published in Honour of Joseph M. Baumgarten\", edited by M. Bernstein, F. García Martínez, J. Kampen (Leiden: Brill, 1997).\n\nHis publications include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1210028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1210028", "title": "Languages of South Africa", "text": "Languages of South Africa\n\nThere are eleven official languages of South Africa: Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sotho, SiSwati, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu. Fewer than two percent of South Africans speak a first language other than an official one. Most South Africans can speak more than one language. Dutch and English were the first official languages of South Africa from 1910 to 1925. Afrikaans was added as a part of Dutch in 1925, although in practice, Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch, which fell into disuse. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, the official relationship changed such that Afrikaans was considered to include Dutch, and Dutch was dropped in 1984, so between 1984 and 1994, South Africa had two official languages: English and Afrikaans. \n\nEnglish being the second language of many South Africans is most likely the most commonly spoken language of the nation. Many countries from around the world have turned to South Africa for their supply of low cost English and other educators.\n\nDifferent government departments and official bodies use different terms to denote Northern Sotho. In South Africa, Southern Ndebele is known simply as \"Ndebele\", as most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe.\n\nSince taking power in the 1994 election, the ANC has promoted English as the main language of government, even if South Africans often take pride in using indigenous languages for any purpose. Afrikaans also features prominently in commerce together with English, as the languages with the highest number of fluent speakers are Afrikaans and English.\n\nIn terms of linguistic classification, the official languages include two West Germanic languages (English and Afrikaans) and nine Southern Bantu languages. Four of these are Nguni languages (Zulu, Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele) and three are Sotho–Tswana languages (Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, and Tswana). Tsonga is a Tswa–Ronga language.\n\nSouth African Sign Language is understood across the country, though sometimes sign-language interpreters use manually coded language.\n\nThe most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu (23 percent), followed by Xhosa (16 percent), and Afrikaans (14 percent). English is the fourth most common first language in the country (9.6%), but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media.\n\nThe majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the Bantu languages represented in South Africa: the Sotho–Tswana branch (Sesotho, Northern Sotho, Tswana), or the Nguni branch (Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Ndebele). For each of the two groups, the languages within that group are for the most part intelligible to a native speaker of any other language within that group.\n\nThe nine indigenous African languages of South Africa can be divided into two geographical zones, with Nguni languages being predominant in the south-eastern third of the country (Indian Ocean coast) and Sesotho languages being predominant in the northern third of the country located further inland, as also in Botswana and Lesotho. Gauteng is the most linguistically heterogeneous province, with roughly equal numbers of Nguni, Sesotho and Indo-European language speakers. This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot, Tsotsitaal, in large urban townships in the province.\n\nAfrikaans, a language derived from Dutch, is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country (Western and Northern Cape). It is spoken as first language by approximately 61 percent of whites and 76 percent of Coloured (multiracial) people in the country. Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country, as a second (or third or even fourth) language by Black South Africans living in farming areas.\n\nThe 2011 census recorded the following distribution of first language speakers:\n\nOther languages spoken in South Africa, though not mentioned in the Constitution, include Fanagalo, Lobedu (\"Khilobedu\"), Northern Ndebele (\"Sindebele\"), Phuthi (\"Siphuthi\").\nLobedu has been variously claimed to be a dialect of Northern Sotho and an autonomous language. Fanagalo is a pidgin often used as a lingua franca in the mining industry.\n\nSignificant numbers of immigrants from Europe, elsewhere in Africa, and the Indian subcontinent means that a wide variety of other languages can also be found in parts of South Africa. In the older immigrant communities there are: Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Portuguese, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Yiddish, Italian and smaller numbers of Dutch, French and German speakers.\n\nThese non-official languages may be used in limited semi-official use where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. More importantly, these languages have significant local functions in specific communities whose identity is tightly bound around the linguistic and cultural identity that these non-official SA languages signal.\n\nThe fastest growing non-official language is Portuguese – first spoken by immigrants from Portugal, especially Madeira and later black and white settlers and refugees from Angola and Mozambique after they won independence from Portugal and now by more recent immigrants from those countries again – and increasingly French, spoken by immigrants and refugees from Francophone Central Africa.\n\nMore recently, speakers of North, Central and West Africa languages have arrived in South Africa, mostly in the major cities, especially in Johannesburg and Pretoria, but also Cape Town and Durban.\n\nChapter 1 (Founding Provisions), Section 6 (Languages) of the Constitution of South Africa is the basis for government language policy.\n\nThe English text of the constitution signed by president Nelson Mandela on 16 December 1996 uses (mostly) the names of the languages expressed in those languages themselves. Sesotho refers to Southern Sotho, and isiNdebele refers to Southern Ndebele. Controversy surrounds the designation of Northern Sesotho as \"Sepedi\" (its main dialect) instead of the comprehensive \"Sesotho sa Leboa\" (which had been the wording in the Interim Constitution of 1993). The spelling of Venda is also incorrectly rendered as \"Tshivenda\" instead of the correct \"Tshivenḓa\".\n\nThe constitution mentions \"sign language\" in the generic sense rather than South African Sign Language specifically.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23407994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23407994", "title": "Minced oaths in media", "text": "Minced oaths in media\n\nIt is common to find minced oaths in literature and media. Writers often include minced oaths instead of profanity in their writing so that they do not offend audiences or incur censorship.\n\nW. Somerset Maugham referred to this problem in his 1919 novel \"The Moon and Sixpence\", where he admitted:\n\nStrickland, according to Captain Nichols, did not use exactly the words I have given, but since this book is meant for family reading, I thought it better—at the expense of truth—to put into his mouth language familiar to the domestic circle.\n\nIn particular, authors of children's fiction sometimes put minced oaths into the mouths of characters who swear a lot, as a way of depicting a part of their behaviour that would be unconvincing not to represent, but also avoiding the use of swear words which would be considered unsuitable for children to read.\n\nIn 1851, Charles Dickens wrote:\nBark's parts of speech are of an awful sort—principally adjectives. I won't, says Bark, have no adjective police and adjective strangers in my adjective premises! I won't, by adjective and substantive! ... Give me, says Bark, my adjective trousers!\n\nThe term \"dickens\" itself, probably from the surname, became a minced oath when referring to the devil.\n\nNorman Mailer's novel \"The Naked and the Dead\" uses \"fug\" in place of \"fuck\" throughout.\n\nMystery writer Fran Rizer deploys \"kindergarten cussin'\" in her Callie Parrish series, where the main character can be heard muttering, \"Dalmatian!\" and \"Shih Tzu!\"\n\nIn Robert Jordan's \"The Wheel of Time\" series, characters use oaths such as \"flaming\" or \"blood and ashes\" or the interjection \"light\" in the same strength as a curse word, without having to print swear words.\n\nScience Fiction writer John Brunner, in novels such as \"The Shockwave Rider\" and \"Stand on Zanzibar\", uses 'Shiv' and 'slit' to refer to male and female body parts (and sometimes males and females) respectively.\n\nThe lead characters of Anthony Crowley (a demon) and Aziraphale (an angel) from \"Good Omens\", by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, both use minced oaths on a number of occasions, though for different reasons (Aziraphale genuinely means to avoid offense, while Crowley, being a demon, simply finds it more acceptable to his post to say 'gosh' instead of 'God').\n\nIn Stephen King's 2006 novel \"Lisey's Story\", the main characters, Lisey and Scott Landon, use the word \"smuck\" instead of \"fuck\", replacing it wherever \"fuck\" would be conceivably used: \"smucking, mothersmucker, smucked up\", etc.\n\nIn the \"Gaunt's Ghosts\" series by Dan Abnett, the Imperial Guardsmen use the word \"feth\" as a general all-purpose swear word, primarily to replace the word \"fuck\".\n\nIn the series \"TZA\", John Spencer uses \"spash\" in place of most curses from the second book forth.\n\nThroughout his comic novel \"Myron\", Gore Vidal replaces various obscenities with the names of judges who were involved in an obscenity trial.\n\nIn the \"Codex Alera\" series, by Jim Butcher, most obscenities are replaced with a variation of the word crow, e.g. crows or crowbegotten.\n\nTerry Pratchett uses minced oaths for comic effect, for example in Mort: \"\"A wizard. I hate ----ing wizards.\" \"Well, you shouldn't ---- them then,\" replied the second, effortlessly pronouncing a row of dashes.\" In a later book, The Truth, the character Mr Tulip habitually and persistently uses a similarly diagetic form of pseudo-profane interjection throughout his dialogue.\n\nIn Stephen King's 2009 novel \"Under the Dome\", the character 'Big Jim' Rennie avoids swearing by replacing words such as \"fucking and clusterfuck\" with \"cottonpicking and clustermug\".\n\nErnest Hemingway substituted muck for that with which it rhymes in 'Across the River and into the Trees ' and fornicate for that with which it doesn't rhyme in 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.' It makes for some awkward constructions in the latter.\n\nSpider Robinson, in his science fiction novels, consistently uses \"kark\" in place of \"fuck\", and \"taken slot\" in place of \"fucking slut\" -- \"slot\" perhaps being also a reference to the female anatomy as receptacle.\n\nWarriors features the minced oaths of \"mouse-dung\" and rarely \"fox-dung,\" and others relevant to the forest are used in place of curses.\n\nIn the Judge Dredd comic strip featured in \"2000 AD\", the futuristic justice department approved the terms \"Stomm\", \"Drokk\", and \"Grud\". This last is a clear reference to the Christian God as it is accompanied by the apparatus of an organized religion, including \"Church of Grud\" and similar. Use of the terms includes the colorful \"Grud on a Greenie!\". From 1977 to 1979, \"2000 AD\" also featured a \"Dan Dare\" comic strip, loosely set in the same continuity as \"Judge Dredd\", and these strips too used such parlance as \"Stomm\" and \"Drokk\".\n\nIn comic series \"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac\", the characters sometimes use the word \"fook\" in place of \"fuck\".\n\nThe DC Comics character Lobo, an invulnerable, intergalactic bounty hunter uses the term \"bastich\" or \"bastiches\" as a combination of bastard and bitch. i.e. \"Take that you lousy bastiches!\"\n\nCaptain Haddock, from \"The Adventures of Tintin\", swears unlike a real sailor with sesquipedalian ejaculations like \"billions of blistering blue barnacles\" and \"thundering typhoons\".\n\nIn the Al Pacino epic \"Scarface\", the title character Tony Montana, played by Pacino, is warned by his Colombian accomplice in the censored version of the film, \"Don't fool with me, Tony\", and \"I warned you not to fool with me, you foolish little monkey\". Otherwise, the film, especially in its uncensored version, is filled with use of the word 'fuck', and the censored TV version replaces these in their dozens with 'fool'.\n\n\"Napoleon Dynamite\", in the film of the same name, which is rated PG, uses minced oaths to a particularly comical effect.\n\nIn the 1945 war film \"A Walk in the Sun\", the screenplay substitutes \"loving\" for \"fucking\" (the universal American soldier's descriptor).\n\nIn \"A Christmas Story\", the character Ralphie is punished by his parents for saying \"Oh, fuck,\" although the offensive word is replaced with \"fudge\" in the film. The narrator, an adult version of Ralphie (voiced by Jean Shepherd), explains that \"I didn't say fudge. I said THE word...the queen mother of dirty words: the F-dash-dash-dash word.\"\n\nIn the 1984 film \"Johnny Dangerously\", the character Roman Maronie is known for butchering the English language, especially English vulgarities:\n\nOne of the more infamous TV edits is that of John McClane's iconic line from \"Die Hard\", \"Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker\" is changed to \"Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon\".\n\nThe TV edit of the film \"The Usual Suspects\", instead of having the police lineup say, \"Give me the keys, you fucking cocksucker\", they say \"Give me the keys, you fairy godmother\".\n\nIn the 1998 film \"The Big Lebowski\", a well-known television edit exists of one profane-heavy scene altered. \"See what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass\" is changed to \"See what happens when you find a stranger in the alps\" and \"this is what happens when you feed a stoner scrambled eggs\".\n\nA television edit of the film \"Repo Man\" contains the injunction \"Flip you, melon farmer!\" (Fuck you, motherfucker!)\n\nA censored version of the 2004 film Shaun of the Dead contains a scene where \"fuck\" and \"prick\" are changed to \"funk\" and \"prink\", respectively. This leads to an exchange of minced oaths beginning, \"it's four in the funking morning!\" and ending with \"it's not hip-hop, it's electro. Prink\".\n\nIn Disney's 2016 animated film \"Zootopia\", Officer Judy Hopps uses the minced oath \"Oh sweet cheese and crackers\".\nThe televised version of the 2006 film \"Snakes on a Plane\" received the following edits to two of Samuel L. Jackson's lines: The line \"I've had with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane\" was changed to \"I've had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane\", and a later use of \"fucking\" is replaced with \"freaking\".\n\nLate Elizabethan drama contains a profusion of minced oaths, probably due to Puritan opposition to swearing. Seven new minced oaths are first recorded between 1598 and 1602, including \"<nowiki>'sblood</nowiki>\" for \"By God's blood\" from Shakespeare, \"<nowiki>'slight</nowiki>\" for \"God's light\" from Ben Jonson, and \"<nowiki>'snails</nowiki>\" for \"By God's nails\" from the historian John Hayward. Swearing on stage was officially banned by the Act to Restraine Abuses of Players in 1606, and a general ban on swearing followed in 1623.\n\nIn some cases the original meanings of these minced oaths were forgotten; \"<nowiki>'struth</nowiki>\" (\"By God's truth\") came to be spelled \"<nowiki>'strewth</nowiki>\" and \"zounds\" changed pronunciation so that it no longer sounded like \"By God's wounds\". Other examples from this period include \"<nowiki>'slid</nowiki>\" for \"By God's eyelid\" (1598) and \"sfoot\" for \"By God's foot\" (1602). \"Gadzooks\" for \"by God's hooks\" (the nails on Christ's cross) followed in the 1650s, \"egad\" for \"oh God\" in the late 17th century, and \"ods bodikins\" for \"by God's little body\" in 1709. This is similar to the use popularized in the 1950s of \"gee whiz\" as an oath for \"Jesus' wisdom\".\n\nIn modern times, the gang members in the musical \"West Side Story\" talk in an invented 1950s-style slang that includes several minced oaths. At the end of the \"Jet Song,\" they sing \"We're gonna beat / Every last buggin' gang / On the whole buggin' street / On the whole ever-mother-lovin' street!\" where \"buggin\" and \"mother-lovin\" are obvious minced oaths.\n\n\"Freaking\" (or sometimes \"fricking\") is often employed on U.S. over-the-air television entertainment programming as an alternative to the adjective \"fucking\", as in \"where's my freaking food?\" It is rarely used to replace \"fucking\" as a term for sexual intercourse.\n\nIn the \"Father Ted\" episode \"The Old Grey Whistle Theft\", Ted's picnic at the local picnic area is disturbed by people claiming that he is in their \"fupping spot\". The man yells out \"Fup off, ya grasshole\" and when Ted asks them why they are talking like that, the man points to a list of picnic area rules, one of which is \"No Swearing\". The man finishes by yelling out \"Fup off, ya pedrophile.\" In every single episode of \"Father Ted\" no Irish character utters the word \"fuck\", apart from one scene in \"Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep\" where the phrase \"fucking hell\" is shouted twice; although its attenuated alternative \"feck\" is heard repeatedly throughout.\n\nIn both incarnations of the television series \"Battlestar Galactica\", characters use the word \"frack\" (original) or \"frak\" (re-imagined) in place of \"fuck\" in every sense of the word, as an interjection, as an alternative to the adjective \"fucking\", as in \"where's my fracking food?\" as well as \"fuck\" or \"fucking\" as a term for sexual intercourse. Characters in the original series also use \"felgercarb\" in place of \"shit\". Characters on \"Veronica Mars\" then adopted \"frak\" from \"Battlestar Galactica\".\n\nIn the TV series \"Farscape\" the characters use the word \"frell\" as a combination of \"frig\", \"fuck\", and \"hell\" (as in \"What the frell is going on?\"), and the word \"dren\" instead of \"shit\". \"Hezmana\" and \"yotz\" are also used as rough replacements for \"hell\" and \"crap\" respectively.\n\nIn the TV series \"Firefly\", characters often use the word \"gorram\" in place of \"goddam\" or \"god damned.\" Further, the word \"fuck\" and its variants is replaced variously by \"hump\", \"humped\" or \"rutting\". For example, \"I would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume I'm an evil, lecherous hump,\" \"If they find us at all, we're humped.\" and \"It's the chain I go get and beat you with 'til you understand who's in ruttin' command here.\" Additionally, the characters do much of their cursing in Mandarin Chinese. This keeps the show unobjectionable enough to air on network television, yet at the same time maintain a realistic level of profanity for a show about outlaws, inspired by the wild west.\n\nLikewise, in \"Red Dwarf\", characters use a series of minced oaths regularly. Two such are used moderately, \"Gimboid\" and \"goit\" are derivations of \"gimp\" and \"git\" respectively (although \"git\" is frequently used also), but the final is a series trademark, \"smeg\". Although it is said to have derived from \"smegma\", the show's writers have said it is just a coincidence, as its similarity to the label of an Italian white-goods manufacturer. In any case, it has evolved into a word almost entirely specific to the Red Dwarf universe and numerous alterations were used in the show, such as: \"smeg-head\", \"smeg-for-brains\", \"smegging\", etc.\n\nIn \"South Park\" the word \"fudge\" (instead of \"fuck\") is frequently used, especially in the episode \"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\", where Chef sells chocolate fudge delicacies called \"Fudge 'Ems\", \"Fudge This\", \"Go Fudge Yourself\", \"I Don't Give a Flying Fudge\" and \"I Just Went and Fudged Your Momma\". \"Lover\" and \"loving\" are used in place of \"fuck\" through the \"South Park\" episode \"Chickenlover\". This is explained in the episode to be for the purpose of protecting young news viewers.\n\nThe television series \"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\" contains a sketch in which Fry and Laurie employ minced oaths; it is situated in a courthouse, and Laurie plays a policeman reciting the words of an offender. Examples include, \"I apprehended the accused and advised him of his rights. He replied \"Why don't you ram it up your pim-hole, you fusking cloff prunker.\"\" and \"Skank off, you cloffing cuck, you're all a load of shote-bag fuskers, so prunk that up your prime-ministering pim-hole.\" The sketch ends with Fry asking of Laurie's response to this language, and Laurie proclaiming, \"I told him to mind his fucking language, m'lud.\"\n\nIn the Nickelodeon children's show \"iCarly\", characters often use the term \"chizz\" as a general purpose expletive, most often used in place of 'shit'.  \"iCarly\" is notorious for its thinly veiled adult humor.  Likewise, in the spinoff \"Sam & Cat\", the term \"wazz\" is used in place of 'piss'.\n\nCharacters in the series \"The Good Place\" find themselves in an afterlife where they are incapable of using profanity. When they intend to curse, the word instead comes out as a benign minced oath such as \"fork\" for \"fuck\", \"shirt\" for \"shit\", or \"bench\" for \"bitch\".\n\nDubbing of movies for television often replaces \"Fuck you!\" with \"Forget you!\", \"bastard\" with \"buzzard\", \"fucking\" with \"stinking\", and \"prick\" with \"pig\".\n\nThe Fugs, a mid-1960s band named by Tuli Kupferberg, used a euphemism for \"fuck\" found in Norman Mailer's novel (above), \"The Naked and the Dead\".\n\nIn a discussion of profanity, writer Leigh Lundin uses the glyph ƒ. He further discusses being \"nannied\" by Internet software, noting that words like cockatoo, pussycat, and even Hummer may be flagged, which has become known as the Scunthorpe problem.\n\nIn that vein, ProBoards forums replace the word \"cock\" with \"thingy\", thereby transforming the statement \"cock his shotgun\" into \"thingy his shotgun\". Similarly, the Something Awful forums, filters replace \"fuck\" with the phrase \"gently caress\" and \"shit\" with \"poo-poo\" for unregistered users, and the Fark website replaces words such as \"fuck\" with \"fark\".\n\nOnline, alternative typographical glyphs are sometimes used to evade profanity filters (such as $hit or $#!+ instead of shit, @$$ or @rse instead of ass or arse).\n\n\"fsck\", from \"filesystem check\", is commonly used on Usenet and in other technology-related circles to replace \"fuck\".\n\n"}
{"id": "38233680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38233680", "title": "Mire", "text": "Mire\n\nA mire (or quagmire) is a wetland type, dominated by living, peat-forming plants. Mires arise because of incomplete decomposition of organic matter, due to waterlogging and subsequent anoxia. Like coral reefs, mires are unusual landforms in that they derive mostly from biological rather than physical processes, and can take on characteristic shapes and surface patterning.\n\nThere are four types of mire: bog, fen, marsh and swamp. A bog is a mire that due to its location relative to the surrounding landscape obtains most of its water from rainfall (ombrotrophic), while a fen is located on a slope, flat, or depression and gets most of its water from soil- or groundwater (minerotrophic). Thus while a bog is always acidic and nutrient-poor, a fen may be slightly acidic, neutral, or alkaline, and either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich. Although marshes are wetlands within which vegetation is rooted in mineral soil, some marshes form shallow peat deposits: these should be considered mires. Swamps are characterized by their forest canopy and, like fens, are typically of higher pH and nutrient availability than bogs. Some bogs and fens can support limited shrub or tree growth on hummocks.\n\nFor botanists and ecologists, the term peatland is a more general term for any terrain dominated by peat to a depth of at least , even if it has been completely drained (i.e., a peatland can be dry, but a mire by definition must be actively forming peat).\n\nMires are a kind of \"...living relic... [A] living skin on an ancient body\" in which successive layers of regular plant growth and decay are preserved stratigraphically with a quality of preservation unknown in other wetland environments.\n\nMires, although perhaps at their greatest extent at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, are found around the globe. Mires occur wherever conditions are right for peat accumulation: largely where organic matter is constantly waterlogged. The distribution of mires therefore depends on topography, climate, parent material, biota and time. The type of mire - bog, fen or swamp - depends also on each of these factors.\n\nIn polar regions, mires are usually shallow, because of the slow rate of accumulation of dead organic matter, and often contain permafrost. Very large swathes of Canada, northern Europe and northern Russia are covered by boreal mires. In temperate areas mires are typically more scattered due to historical drainage and peat extraction, but can cover large areas as blanket bog where precipitation is very high (e.g. in maritime climates inland near the coasts of the north-east and south Pacific, and the north-west and north-east Atlantic). In the sub-tropics, mires are rare and restricted to the wettest areas. In the tropics, mires can again be extensive, typically underlying tropical rainforest (e.g. in Kalimantan).\n\nMires are in rapid decline globally due to drainage for agriculture and forestry, and for peat harvesting. For example, more than 50% of original European mire area, more than 300000 km, has been lost.\n\nMires have unusual chemistry, which influences \"inter alia\" their biota and the chemistry of the water outflow. Peat has very high cation-exchange capacity due to its high organic matter content: cations such as Ca are preferentially adsorbed onto the peat in exchange for H ions. Water passing through peat declines in nutrients and in pH. Therefore mires are typically nutrient-poor and acidic unless the inflow of groundwater (bringing in supplementary cations) is high.\n\nMires elevate the ground surface above the original topography. Mires can reach considerable heights above the underlying mineral soil or bedrock: peat depths of above 10m have been recorded in temperate regions (many temperate and most boreal mires were removed by ice sheets in the last Ice Age), and above 25m in tropical regions. When the absolute decay rate in the \"catotelm\" (the lower, water-saturated zone of a mire) matches the rate of input of new peat into the catotelm, the mire will stop growing in height. A simplistic calculation, using typical values for a Sphagnum bog of 1mm new peat added per year and 0.0001 proportion of the catotelm decaying per year, gives a maximum height of 10m. More advanced analyses incorporate expectable nonlinear rates of catotelm decay.\n\nAll types of mires share the common characteristic of being saturated with water at least seasonally with actively forming peat while having its own set of vegetation and organisms. \n\nMires influence carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere such that when the water table rises, such as during a rainstorm, the peat and its microbes are submerged under water and inhibits the access to oxygen, giving opportunity for anaerobic microorganisms to flourish. Carbon dioxide is released when the water table shrinks, such as during a drought, as this supplies the aerobic microbes with oxygen to decompose the peat, subsequently releasing carbon dioxide. Levels of methane, CH, also varies with the water table position and somewhat with temperature. Methanogens are responsible for producing methane via decomposition of the peat which consequently increases as the water table rises and oxygen levels are depleted. Increased temperatures in the soil also contributes to increased seasonal methane flux, though at a lower intensity. It is shown that the methane increased by as much as 300% seasonal from increased precipitation and temperature of the soil. \n\nMires are important reservoirs of climatic information to the past because they are sensitive to changes in the environment and can reveal levels of isotopes, pollutants, macrofossils, metals from the atmosphere, and pollen. For example, carbon-14 dating can reveal the age of the peat. The dredging and destruction of a mire will release the carbon dioxide that could reveal irreplaceable information about the past climatic conditions. It is widely known that a plethora of microorganisms inhabit mires due to the regular supply of water and abundance of peat forming vegetation. These microorganisms include but are not limited to methanogens, algae, bacteria, zoobenthos, of which Sphagnum species are most abundant. The peat in mires contain a substantial amount of organic matter, where humic acid dominates. Humic materials are able to store very large amounts of water, making them an essential component in the peat environment, contributing to an increased amount of carbon storage due to the resulting anaerobic condition. If the peatland is dried from long-term cultivation and agricultural use, it will lower the water table and the increased aeration will subsequently release carbon content. Upon extreme drying, the ecosystem can undergo a state shift, turning the mire into a barren land with lower biodiversity and richness. The formation of humic acid occurs during the biogeochemical degradation of vegetation debris, animal residue, and degraded segments. The loads of organic matter in the form of humic acid is a source of precursors of coal. Prematurely exposing the organic matter to the atmosphere promotes the conversion of organics to carbon dioxide to be released in the atmosphere. \n\nWetlands provide an environment where organic carbon is stored in living plants, dead plants and peat, as well as converted to carbon dioxide and methane. Microbial activity is promoted by the large amounts of dissolved organic matter in wetlands, containing 45-50% carbon. Mineralization through bacterial oxidation converts this carbon to inorganic substances, allowing carbon storage to occur. Three main factors giving wetlands the ability to sequester and store carbon are the high biological productivity, high water table and low decomposition rates. Suitable meteorological and hydrological conditions are necessary to provide an abundant water source for the wetland. Fully water-saturated wetland soils allow anaerobic conditions to manifest, storing carbon but releasing methane. Wetlands make up about 5-8% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface but contain about 20-30% of the planet’s 2500 Pg soil carbon stores. Mires, as well as bogs, fens and marshes are the wetland types that contain the highest amounts of soil organic carbon, and can thus be considered peatlands. Wetlands can become sources of carbon, rather than sinks, as the decomposition occurring within the ecosystem emits methane. Natural peatlands do not have a measurable cooling effect on the climate in a short time span as the cooling effects of sequestering carbon are offset by the emission of methane, which induces warming. Despite this, peatlands do result in cooling of the Earth's climate over a longer time period as methane is oxidized quickly and removed from the atmosphere whereas atmospheric carbon dioxide is continuously absorbed. However, in the paper ‘Wetlands, carbon and climate change’ by Mitsch et al., it was determined “that methane emissions become unimportant within 300 years compared to carbon sequestration in wetlands. Within that time frame or less, most wetlands become both net carbon and radiative sinks.” Peatlands insulate the permafrost in subarctic regions, thus delaying thawing during summer, as well as inducing the formation of permafrost. As the global climate continues to warm, wetlands could become major carbon sources as higher temperatures cause higher carbon dioxide emissions. Compared with untilled cropland, wetlands can sequester around two times the carbon, and planted wetlands may be able to store 2-15 times more carbon than what they release. Carbon sequestration can occur in constructed wetlands, as well as natural ones. Estimates of greenhouse gas fluxes from wetlands indicate that natural wetlands have lower fluxes, but man-made wetlands have a greater carbon sequestration capacity. The carbon sequestration abilities of wetlands can be improved through restoration and protection strategies, but it takes several decades for these restored ecosystems to become comparable in carbon storage to peatlands and other forms of natural wetlands.\n\nTropical peatlands comprise 0.25% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface but store 3% of all soil and forest carbon stocks and are mostly located in developing countries. The exploitation of these ecosystems, such as the draining and harvesting of tropical peat forests, releases a large amount of carbon dioxide. In addition, fires caused by dry peat due to the draining of peat bogs releases even more carbon dioxide. The economic value of a tropical peatland used to be derived from raw materials, such as wood, bark, resin, and latex; the extraction of which did not release carbon emissions. Today, many of these ecosystems are drained for conversion to palm oil plantations, releasing the stored carbon dioxide and preventing the system from sequestering carbon again. The planned Carbopeat Project will attempt to assign economic value to the carbon sequestration performed by peat bogs to stop the exploitation of these ecosystems.\n"}

The Nzadi language has three dialects, \"Ngiemba, Lensibun,\" and \"Ndzé Ntaa\".\n\nNzadi contains seven contrastive vowels, which can be either long or short. The table below shows all the vowel phonemes found in the language:\n\nUnlike other Bantu languages, which favor polysyllablic word stems, Nzadi consists primarily of monosyllabic stems. Bisyllabic stems are also present, but they are primarily borrowings or reduplications. \nAll stems necessarily begin with a consonant, and monosyllabic stems take four possible structures: CV, CVC, CVV, or CVVC. In the case of bisyllabic stems, both syllables begin with a consonant, and long vowels never occur in the first syllable, and rarely in the second.\n\nAs a result of the systematic shortening of word stems, Nzadi words tend to have more vowel clusters than other Bantu languages, and in many cases adjusts one or more of the adjacent vowels by the following processes.\n\nWhen two different vowels occur in succession, one of three things can happen, depending on several factors:\nIn cases in which coalescence does not occur, a long vowel followed immediately by another vowel will shorten.\n\nDue to the historical word shortening from Proto-Bantu, Nzadi does not have the stem-level vowel harmony that many other Bantu languages do. However, one kind of harmony does present itself: /e-/ or /o-/ noun prefixes will harmonize to ɛ- or ɔ- if the stem has an identical /ɛ/ or /ɔ/ vowel.\n\nNzadi, like other Bantu languages, has two contrastive tone leves, high (H) and low (L), which can combine to form falling (HL), rising (LH), and rising-falling (LHL) contour tones.\nTone in Nzadi conveys important lexical and grammatical information, and can be the only difference between different words and forms, as seen in the minimal quintuplet here:\n\nWhen a contour tone is followed by another tone that begins with the same tone level as the end of the first, the first tone is simplified by dropping the final tone level. For example, a HL contour followed by a L tone will be simplified to H.\n\nContour simplification is similar to tone absorption, but occurs when adjacent tone levels are different, as seen in the following possessive constructions:\nDespite the functional load of tone in Nzadi, intonation can interact or interfere with lexical tones, particularly when a pause in the utterance is taken. In this case, a H boundary tone is inserted.\n"}

Pattern Languages were introduced by Dana Angluin in the context of machine learning.\n\nGiven a finite set Σ of constant symbols and a countable set \"X\" of variable symbols disjoint from Σ, a pattern is a finite non-empty string of symbols from Σ∪\"X\".\nThe length of a pattern \"p\", denoted by |\"p\"|, is just the number of its symbols.\nThe set of all patterns containing exactly \"n\" distinct variables (each of which may occur several times) is denoted by \"P\", the set of all patterns at all by \"P\".\nA substitution is a mapping \"f\": \"P\" → \"P\" such that\nIf \"p\" = \"f\"(\"q\") for some patterns \"p\", \"q\" ∈ \"P\" and some substitution \"f\", then \"p\" is said to be less general than \"q\", written \"p\"≤\"q\";\nin that case, necessarily |\"p\"| ≥ |\"q\"| holds.\nFor a pattern \"p\", its language is defined as the set of all less general patterns that are built from constants only, formally: \"L\"(\"p\") = { \"s\" ∈ Σ : \"s\" ≤ \"p\" }, where Σ denotes the set of all finite non-empty strings of symbols from Σ.\n\nFor example, using the constants Σ = { 0, 1 } and the variables \"X\" = { \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", ... }, the pattern 0\"x\"10\"xx\"1 ∈\"P\" and \"xxy\" ∈\"P\" has length 7 and 3, respectively.\nAn instance of the former pattern is 00\"z\"100\"z\"0\"z\"1 and 01\"z\"101\"z\"1\"z\"1, it is obtained by the substitution that maps \"x\" to 0\"z\" and to 1\"z\", respectively, and each other symbol to itself. Both 00\"z\"100\"z\"0\"z\"1 and 01\"z\"101\"z\"1\"z\"1 are also instances of \"xxy\". In fact, \"L\"(0\"x\"10\"xx\"1) is a subset of \"L\"(\"xxy\"). The language of the pattern \"x\"0 and \"x\"1 is the set of all bit strings which denote an even and odd binary number, respectively. The language of \"xx\" is the set of all strings obtainable by concatenating a bit string with itself, e.g. 00, 11, 0101, 1010, 11101110 ∈ \"L\"(\"xx\").\n\nThe problem of deciding whether \"s\" ∈ \"L\"(\"p\") for an arbitrary string \"s\" ∈ Σ and pattern \"p\" is NP-complete (see picture),\nand so is hence the problem of deciding \"p\" ≤ \"q\" for arbitrary patterns \"p\", \"q\".\n\nThe class of pattern languages is not closed under ...\nThe class of pattern languages is closed under ...\n\nIf \"p\", \"q\" ∈ \"P\" are patterns containing exactly one variable, then \"p\" ≤ \"q\" if and only if \"L\"(\"p\") ⊆ \"L\"(\"q\");\nthe same equivalence holds for patterns of equal length.\nFor patterns of different length, the above example \"p\" = 0\"x\"10\"xx\"1 and \"q\" = \"xxy\" shows that \"L\"(\"p\") ⊆ \"L\"(\"q\") may hold without implying \"p\" ≤ \"q\".\nHowever, any two patterns \"p\" and \"q\", of arbitrary lengths, generate the same language if and only if they are equal up to consistent variable renaming.\nEach pattern \"p\" is a common generalization of all strings in its generated language \"L\"(\"p\"), modulo associativity of (⋅).\n\nIn a refined Chomsky hierarchy, the class of pattern languages is a proper superclass and subclass of the singleton and the indexed languages, respectively, but incomparable to the language classes in between; due to the latter, the pattern language class is not explicitly shown in the table below.\n\nThe class of pattern languages is incomparable with the class of finite languages, with the class of regular languages, and with the class of context-free languages:\nEach singleton language is trivially a pattern language, generated by a pattern without variables.\n\nEach pattern language can be produced by an indexed grammar:\nFor example, using Σ = { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" } and \"X\" = { x, y },\nthe pattern \"a\" x \"b\" y \"c\" x \"a\" y \"b\" is generated by a grammar with nonterminal symbols \"N\" = { \"S\", \"S\", \"S\" } ∪ \"X\", terminal symbols \"T\" = Σ, index symbols \"F\" = { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" }, start symbol \"S\", and the following production rules:\n\nAn example derivation is:\n  ⇒   \n  ⇒   \n  ⇒   \n  ⇒   \n  ⇒   \n  ⇒ ... ⇒   \n  ⇒ ... ⇒   \n  ⇒ ... ⇒   \n\nIn a similar way, an index grammar can be constructed from any pattern.\n\nGiven a sample set \"S\" of strings, a pattern \"p\" is called descriptive of \"S\" if \"S\" ⊆ \"L\"(\"p\"), but not \"S\" ⊆ \"L\"(\"q\") ⊂ \"L\"(\"p\") for any other pattern \"q\".\n\nGiven any sample set \"S\", a descriptive pattern for \"S\" can be computed by \nBased on this algorithm, the class of pattern languages can be identified in the limit from positive examples.\n"}

{"id": "41687012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41687012", "title": "Poverty porn", "text": "Poverty porn\n\nPoverty porn, also known as development porn, famine porn, or stereotype porn, has been defined as \"any type of media, be it written, photographed or filmed, which exploits the poor's condition in order to generate the necessary sympathy for selling newspapers or increasing charitable donations or support for a given cause\". It's also a term of criticism applied to films which objectify people in poverty for the sake of entertaining a privileged audience.\n\nThe concept of poverty porn was first introduced in the 1980s, a golden age for charity campaigns. Charity campaigns during this period made use of hard-hitting images such as pictures of malnourished children with flies in their eyes. This quickly became a trend and there were several notable campaigns such as Live Aid. Though some of these campaigns were successful in raising money for charity (over $150 million to help combat famine), some observers criticised the approach, claiming it oversimplified chronic poverty; this apparent sensationalism was dubbed by critics as \"poverty porn.\"\n\nIn the 1980s the media used what some believed to be inappropriate use of children in poverty. However, towards the end of this era more positive images emerged to tell their stories, although, in recent years it has been noticed that the disturbing images are being highlighted once more.\n\nThe practice is controversial, as some believe it to be exploitative, whilst others praise the way it can allow organisations to reach their objectives. It has been common for charity organisations such as UNICEF and Oxfam to portray famine, poverty, and children in order to attract sympathy and increase donations.\n\nAlthough poverty porn can be seen as a tool to generate further donations, many believe it deforms reality as it portrays the image of an impotent society, entirely dependent on other western societies to survive, as well as being overly voyeuristic.\n\nIt is a common debate to have as to whether it is justifiable or not to portray stereotypes and to use sensationalism in order to generate empathy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a Nigerian writer, notes that \"The problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.\"\n\nThroughout fundraising campaigns, charities attempt to interview those who they are trying to help, in order to get the word across to the general public. However, it is common for them to encounter ongoing refusal from those in desolated situations to take pictures or to publicly share their traumatic story. This further emphasises the concept that being in an uneasy, not to say miserable, situation is a shameful one, and poverty porn in media exposes those who do not necessarily have the desire to be exposed.\n\nPoverty porn is used in media through visually miserable images, in order to trigger some sort of emotion amongst its audience. It is commonly thought however, that to expose one's misery publicly through images, interviews and other means, is an impermissible invasion of privacy.\n\nThe use of one photo to label an entire country as destitute makes the audience falsely assume that the entire country share the same story.\n\nAlli Heller, a Nigerian writer and anthropologist says: \"Imagine for a minute that you were chronically incontinent. Now imagine that you didn't have access to adult diapers or sanitary napkins ... Imagine how the acidity of the unremitting flow of urine burned away at your thighs, cracking your skin and leaving you vulnerable to painful infections. Imagine the shame you'd feel – a grown adult incapable of avoiding the small pool of urine you'd leave behind on a friend's chair after a visit ... Why must we highlight the extreme cases when the norm is bad enough?\"\n\nPoverty porn is highly exposed in today's pop culture, as the concept has become pervasive in films and TV shows.\n\nThe British television programme \"The Hardest Grafter\" illustrates this as it portrays 25 of Britain's \"poorest workers\", all having the shared ultimate objective of winning £15,000 through the completion of various tasks. In this case, the contestants' poverty attracts a television audience which was, before the show even started, contested as various petitions were made in order to stop what was believed to be a \"perverted audience and profit making operation\". It is considered to not only be perverted, but also discriminatory as the contestants can only be poor.\n\nBBC Two replied to these accusations by affirming that it would be a \"serious social experiment to show just how hard those part of the low-wage economy work\" as well as \"tackling some of the most pressing issues of our time: why is British productivity low?\"\n\nA spokesman from the show's production company, Twenty Twenty, stated that: \"the show will challenge and shatter all sorts of myths surrounding the low-paid and unemployed sector.\"\n\nBroome, a reality TV show creator, states that it exposes the hardship of some families and their ability to keep on going through values, love and communication. He assures that he would much prefer create these shows rather than those like Jersey Shore which depicts \"a group of strangers from New Jersey as they party throughout six seasons\".\n\n"}

Its use is relatively widespread within this subculture. Its name derives from the name of the central female character in the classic BDSM novel \"Story of O\" (written by Pauline Réage), who was a sex slave and wore an analogous ring.\n\nThe ring mentioned in the original novel was quite different from what is most commonly known as the \"Ring of O\" today. The novel describes the ring as shaped similarly to a signet ring (with a seal disk on top which was relatively large for a woman's ring), made out of dull-gray polished iron, lined with gold on the inside, and with a golden Triskelion on its top area.\n\nThe ring's symbolic meaning in the novel differs quite a bit from the one commonly used among BDSM practitioners today. In the book, such a ring is worn by a female \"slave\" after she has finished her training at Roissy. Those wearing the ring are obliged to be obedient to any man who belongs to the secret society of Roissy (whose emblem is the triskelion), and must allow him to do absolutely everything with them that he pleases.\n\nThis stands in strong contrast to the ring's meaning today. People indicate by wearing such rings that they are interested in BDSM, and sometimes by the hand they wear it on whether they are a Top or a Bottom.\n\nThe first film adaptation of the novel \"Story of O\" showed a design consisting of a cylindrical steel ring with an attached ball holding an even smaller toroidal ring (which could swivel in one direction). This alluded to the leather collar and bracelets, each with a metal ring, that had been locked onto O during her training.\n\nThe first image of this jewellery design was published in the September issue (No.4) of the German BDSM magazine \"Schlagzeilen\" in 1989.\n\nThe term \"O Ring\" is sometimes used to refer to collars as well (contrasting with \"D-ring\" collars). In this context it can describe a collar with one large ring for fastening. Collars featuring such rings are often worn by bottoms to indicate that they are in a steady relationship.\n\n\n"}

Much of his more commercial work was in collaboration with Vesa-Matti Loiri (whose most popular character created by Pasanen was Uuno Turhapuro; first in TV sketches and then in a long-lasting series of motion pictures) and Simo Salminen. Pasanen's films and TV shows, often made fast and inexpensively in a conveyor-belt mode, usually didn't gain much recognition from the critics but were extremely popular among Finnish audiences from the 1960s onwards.\n\nHe was the owner of his own film production company, Filmituotanto Spede Pasanen Ky. He is noted as the main influence of many who make an attempt to break into the Finnish comedy scene. Spede also had a long, strained relationship with Suomen elokuvasäätiö, a government-financed film-funding organisation which continuously refused to fund his movies.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s Spede was a noted presence as a radio comedian. He applied to work at Yleisradio twice in 1956 and again in 1959 as an entertainment provider (ajanvietetoimittaja) and was hired on his second try. Spede's most popular program was \"Ruljanssiriihi\" which combined sketch-comedy and musical performances. The program eventually developed into the program \"Hupiklubi\". Spede and actor Leo Jokela also created the break-out character G. Pula-Aho (voiced by Jokela), a smart-talking, Helsinki slang using parrot who would insult Spede on Ruljanssiriihi.\n\nSpede's other programs included \"Tervahöyry Hyrskynmyrskyn suvisilla laineilla\", \"Hyvää iltaa – tulkaa mukaan\" and \"Kesäterässä\".\n\nAfter playing several supporting roles throughout the 1950s Spede made his first starring appearance in 1964's X-Paroni which he wrote and co-directed with his on-screen co-star Jaakko Pakkasvirta. The movie's success led to the creation of Milli Pilleri which also introduced moviegoers to Simo Salminen who became a fixture of Spede's acting troupe, often playing the side-kick to Spede's own characters. It was also the first movie Spede co-directed with Jukka Virtanen and Ere Kokkonen who would alternate directing Spede's future motion pictures, while Spede focused more on writing and producing. \n\n1967's period-comedy Noin Seitsemän Veljestä was a parody of Robin Hood which Spede had worked on since the 1950s and introduced Vesa-Matti Loiri as an adult actor (having made his on-screen debut years earlier as a child actor in Pojat). The success of these movies led to Spede producing and releasing three movies in 1969, Näköradiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut, Leikkikalugangsteri as well as his first colour feature Pohjan Tähteet. Näköradiomies performed well despite being a more serious movie but it and Pohjan Tähteet underperformed in comparison to the more typically comical Leikkikalugangsteri. Despite Pohjantähteet winning a shared Jussi Award for Kari Sohlberg in the category of best cinematography (with Spede's own Leikkikalugangsteri and Jörn Donner's Sixtynine 69), Pasanen did not produce another colour feature until the late 1970s.\n\nSpede continued to experience success with Speedy Gonzales – noin 7 veljeksen poika and the tragic comedy Jussi Pussi both released in 1970. Speedy Gonzales performed well, despite Vesa-Matti Loiri being absent due to a leg injury just prior to shooting (he instead received a writing credit). Spede had to finance most of his films during this period due to his poor relations with the Finnish Film Foundation.\n\nIn 1971, Spede released three motion-pictures, Kahdekses Veljes (his debut as a solo director) and Hirttämättömät (the sequel to Speedy Gonzales) both starring himself as well as Saatanan Radikaalit, which was co-directed by its four starring actors Paavo Piironen, Heikki Nousiainen, Timo Nissi and Heikki Huopainen. Spede only produced this movie which was intended to give its four stars a chance to complete a motion-picture on their own. All three movies under-performed though which led to Spede taking a two-year hiatus from film-making during which he focused exclusively on his TV work. Regardless, Spede won the 1971 Producers' Jussi Award for all three movies.\n\nIn 1973, Spede released the first Uuno Turhapuro movie based on the popular skit-character by the same name. To save costs, Spede filmed and edited the movie entirely on video and had it transferred to film for theatrical distribution. Uuno became a hit and a further four Uuno films were finished during the 1970s. Spede resumed filming small budget comedies with 1974's Viu-Hah-Hah-Taja, directed by Ere Kokkonen and mostly starring Spede's TV actors. Spede only appeared in a cameo and went uncredited as the film's writer. In 1979, he released Koeputkiaikuinen ja Simon enkelit, his first colour feature since Pohjantähteet. The movie was a surprise hit and led to a sequel Tup Akka Lakko being released the following year.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Uuno series peaked in popularity with 1984's Uuno Turhapuro armeijan leivissä breaking the record of the most popular Finnish domestic film. Spede cranked out movies on an annual basis, using his stock actors and frequently utilizing the popular skit characters for movies such as Kliffaa Hei, Pikkupojat, Fakta Homma and Onks Viljoo Näkyny. The last of these skit-comedy films is considered to be 1990's Rampe & Naukkis - Kaikkien aikojen superpari, which was lampooned on the popular characters created by Pirkka-Pekka Petelius and Aake Kalliala for the TV show Pulttibois.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Spede focused almost exclusively on producing rather than writing or directing films with TV work taking more and more of his time.\n\nStarting from 1964, Spede began making live 15-minute sketch programming for Yleisradio. The show which alternated between the titles Spedevisio, Speden Saluuna as well as Spede Show established many of the tropes and core actors whom Spede would use in his films. Most of the early skit work is now lost due to live broadcasts not being routinely recorded. Spede appeared on TV continuously until 1976 when he started to focus primarily on film work.\n\nStarting from 1981, Spede once again put priority on TV work. First airing surviving black and white skits on the recently established independent Mainos-TV channel, Spede, Simo Salminen and Vesa-Matti Loiri began producing new skits. Hannele Lauri also joined as a regular cast-member. The new Spede Show continued to air until 1987 when Spede and Loiri had a mock-feud which led to the launch of Vesa-Matti Loiri's own TV sketch show, Vesku Show. Throughout the 1980s, Spede also produced other programs such as the comedy program \"Fakta Homma\" and the competition show \"Kymppitonni\" with host Riitta Väisänen.\n\nBy the 1990s, Spede was himself tired of sketch-work but produced Aake Kalliala's and Pirkka-Pekka Petelius's Pulttibois and Tsa Tsa Tsaa as well as the sporty competition show Speden Spelit. Pasanen also produced more drama-programming such as \"Hynttyyt Yhteen\", \"Blondi Tuli Taloon\", and \"Ihmeiden tekijät\" (as well as its follow-up, \"Parhaat Vuodet\"). Many of these shows became stables of MTV3 with many of them airing for several seasons. Spede also approved the production of the dramedy-series \"Kuumia Aaltoja\", which aired in 2003 (two years after his death).\n\nSpede Pasanen named Bob Hope as one of his biggest comedy influences.\n\nSpede Pasanen is considered emblematic of Savonian ironic humor varying between the fullest extremes of understatement and hyperbole. As he himself explained: \"A Savonian never tells a thing exactly like it is.\" Spede's comedy denounced elitism and he explicitly sought to write and perform comedy for the largest possible audience. His early films in particular, featured elements uncommon to Finnish cinema such as fist-fights, car chases, other elaborate stunt-work as well as unconventional special effects. Many of his movies also featured unconventional settings (such as the medieval period or the wild west), though his later films focused almost entirely on poking fun at Finnish stereotypes.\n\nHis Uuno Turhapuro movies can be considered conventional farces. An unemployed slacker will, with comically incredible luck, a father-in-law who is rich and connected but unlucky (mainly due to Uuno), and with slick charm, end up in roles of minister, general officer, or rich man, usually causing havoc in the father-in-law's businesses.\n\nPasanen was also an inventor and jack-of-all-trades; he had over 50 patents registered to his name, and many of his films include Rube Goldberg-style gadgets. Besides gadgets involved with industrial production, his inventions include:\n\n\nFor a period of time Pasanen was also obsessed with inventing a perpetual motion device. His crude drawings of it also appeared in his sketchs shows and films. Once he became convinced that perpetual motion is theoretically impossible, he openly ridiculed himself in the character of \"Härski Hartikainen\" in one of the Uuno Turhapuro movies.\n\nSpede married Pirjo Vainimäki, the leading lady of his first starring picture \"X-Paroni\", in 1965. Spede's first and only child, Pirre Pasanen, was born later that year. The couple separated in the early 1980s and divorced later.\n\nA family private individual, Pasanen did not discuss his personal relationships in public. He had a long relationship with the 1976 Miss Europe, Riitta Väisänen. Pasanen valued loyalty and friendship, and even after separation, kept employing and financially supporting previous companions. During and after relationships, he vouchsafed confidentiality and privacy for all involved in his private life. His good relations with the media might have helped with this.\n\nPasanen's nickname \"Spede\" came from an earlier nickname \"Speedy\", referring to his prowess as an ice hockey player during his childhood.\n\nOn 7 September 2001 Pasanen was playing a round of golf at the Sarfvik golf course in Kirkkonummi, Finland. At the 9th hole he began to feel ill and was taken to the club house, where his condition rapidly deteriorated. Despite resuscitation by a doctor and a rapid response of emergency medical services Pasanen died. His death was attributed to advanced coronary artery disease.\n\n\nIn the Uuno Turhapuro series, Pasanen played the role of Härski-Hartikainen, a car repairman with a cunning and ribald character, who often participated in Uuno's farcical adventures. His sidekick was Sörsselssön – earlier known as Lörssön (played by Simo Salminen).\n\nSpede is considered the father of modern Finnish television sketch-humour. Starting his career on Yleisradio he later jumped camps to the competing MTV3 network. However, his work on both has been extremely popular. Apart from starring in these series he was also the main producer for many of the popular shows on MTV3, such as the game-show \"Kymppitonni\" and the cult-hit show \"Pulttibois\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34388536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34388536", "title": "Sphinx water erosion hypothesis", "text": "Sphinx water erosion hypothesis\n\nThe Sphinx water erosion hypothesis is a fringe claim contending that the main type of weathering evident on the enclosure walls of the Great Sphinx was caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall that would have predated the time of Djedefre and Khafre, the Pharaohs credited by most modern Egyptologists with building the Great Sphinx and Second Pyramid at Giza around 2500 BC. Egyptologists, geologists and others have rejected the water erosion hypothesis and the idea of an older Sphinx, offering various alternative explanations for the cause and date of the erosion.\n\nR. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, a French mystic and alternative Egyptologist, first claimed evidence of water erosion on the walls of the Sphinx enclosure in the 1950s. John Anthony West, an author and alternative Egyptologist, investigated Schwaller de Lubicz's ideas further and, in 1989, sought the opinion of Robert M. Schoch, a geologist and associate professor of natural science at the College of General Studies at Boston University.\n\nFrom his investigation of the enclosure's geology, Schoch concluded the main type of weathering evident on the Sphinx enclosure walls was caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall. According to Schoch, the area has experienced a mean annual rainfall of approximately one inch (2.5 cm) since the Old Kingdom (\"c\". 2686 – 2134 BC), such that, since Egypt's last period of significant rainfall ended between the late fourth and early 3rd millennium BC, the Sphinx's construction must date to the 6th or 5th millennium BC.\n\nSchoch further notes the same heavy precipitation-induced weathering as seen on the walls of the Sphinx enclosure is also found on the core blocks of the Sphinx and Valley Temples, both known to have been originally constructed from blocks taken from the Sphinx enclosure when the body was carved. Though the presence of extensive 4th Dynasty repair work to the Sphinx and associated temples is acknowledged by such Egyptologists as Lehner and Hawass, Schoch contends: \"Therefore if the granite facing is covering deeply weathered limestone, the original limestone structures must predate by a considerable degree the granite facing. Obviously, if the limestone cores (originating from the Sphinx ditch) of the temples predate the granite ashlars (granite facings), and the granite ashlars are attributable to Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty, then the Great Sphinx was built prior to the reign of Khafre.\"\n\nColin Reader, a British geologist, agrees that the suggested evidence of weathering indicates prolonged water erosion. Reader found, \"inter alia\", that the flow of rainwater causing the weathering had been stemmed by the construction of 'Khufu's quarries', which lie directly \"upstream\" of the Sphinx enclosure, and therefore concludes that the Sphinx must predate the reign of Khufu (2589 – 2566 BC), and certainly Khafra, by several hundred years. Reader disagrees with Schoch's palaeometeorological estimates, and instead concludes that the Sphinx dates to the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150 – 2686 BC).). To explain the disproportionate size of the head compared to the body, Reader, as does Schoch, also suggests the head of the Sphinx was originally that of a lion and recarved sometime later in the likeness of a pharaoh.\n\nZahi Hawass, former Egyptian minister of state for antiquities affairs and secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, was asked in an interview on the PBS series NOVA if it was possible that a more ancient civilization might have sculpted the Sphinx. Hawass replied: \"Of course it is not possible for one reason …. No single artifact, no single inscription, or pottery, or anything has been found until now, in any place to predate the Egyptian civilization more than 5,000 years ago.\" This reasoning and conclusion was supported in a similar NOVA interview by Mark Lehner, another senior Egyptologist. Other archaeologists who have made similar criticisms include Kenneth Feder.\n\nA different argument used by Egyptologists to ascribe the Sphinx to Khafra is the \"context\" theory, which notes that the Sphinx is located in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the Second Pyramid, which is traditionally connected with Khafra. Apart from the Causeway, the Pyramid and the Sphinx, the complex also includes the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple, both of which display the same architectural style, with 100-tonne stone blocks quarried out of the Sphinx enclosure. A diorite statue of Khafra, which was discovered buried upside down along with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed as support for the Khafra theory. Reader agrees that the Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple are closely associated with the Sphinx, as is the Causeway and even part of the Khafra Mortuary Temple, but suggests this evidence merely indicates these structures also predate Khafra and does not link the Sphinx in any way to Khafra. Rainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo suggests Khufu, Khafra's father, was the builder of the Sphinx and contends Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure which he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx. Lehner's official website also offers a similar argument based on an Archaeological sequence of structures built in the area. Lehner points to the way several structures in the area incorporate elements from older structures, and based on the order in which they were constructed concludes that the archaeological sequencing does not allow for a date older than the reign of Khafra.\n\nHawass points to the poor quality of much of the Giza limestone as the basis for the significant erosion levels. He has concluded, from the present-day rapid rate of erosion on the Member II surface of the Sphinx, that \"[t]he eleven hundred years between Khafre and the first major restoration in the Eighteenth Dynasty, or even half this time, would have been more than enough to erode the Member II into the deep recesses behind Phase I restoration masonry\". Schoch states that other structures and surfaces on the Giza Plateau are made from the same band of limestone as the Sphinx enclosure, but they do not show the same erosion as the walls of the Sphinx enclosure.\n\nPeter Lacovara, an Egyptologist and curator at the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University, Atlanta, assigns \"some of the erosional features\" on the enclosure walls to quarrying activities rather than weathering, and states that other wear and tear on the Sphinx itself is due to groundwater percolation and wind erosion.\n\nSome geologists have proposed alternative explanations for the evidence of weathering in the Sphinx enclosure.\n\nOne of the alternative erosion mechanisms proposed is called haloclasty. Moisture on limestone will dissolve salts, which are then carried by percolating moisture into the spaces inside the porous limestone. When the moisture dries the salt crystallises, and the expanding crystals cause a fine layer of surface limestone to flake off. It is accepted by Schoch \"et al.\" that this mechanism is evident in many places on the Giza Plateau. One proponent of the haloclasty process is Dr James A. Harrell of the University of Toledo, who advocates that the deep erosion crevices were caused by the haloclasty process being driven by moisture in the sand that covered the carved rock for much of the time since it was exposed by quarrying. Lal Gauri \"et al.\" also favour the haloclasty process to explain the erosion features, but have theorised that the weathering was driven by moisture deriving from atmospheric precipitation such as dew.\n\nAnalysis of the Sphinx's bedrock by the Getty Conservation Institute (1990–1992) concluded that \"Continual salt crystallization, which has a destructive effect on the stone, would explain at least some of the deterioration of the Sphinx.\"\n\nHaloclasty is rejected as an explanation for the vertical erosion features by Schoch because it doesn’t explain all the visible evidence, namely that the water erosion features are not evenly distributed, being concentrated in those areas that would have been particularly exposed to running water, whereas the haloclasty process should have operated evenly on all exposed limestone surfaces. Similarly, Schoch points out that the alternative explanations do not account for the absence of similar weathering patterns on other rock surfaces in the Giza pyramid complex which were cut from the same limestone beds.\n\nIn an article published in the January 2015 issue of GEO ExPro magazine, geoscientist Jørn Christiansen provided his own analysis of the \"vertical weathering\" after visiting the Sphinx. Christiansen found evidence that shows that at least some of the erosion took place before the Sphinx was carved. He stated that water most likely seeped through natural fissures in the limestone before the Sphinx had been carved, causing the walls of the Sphinx to look like they were carved much earlier than they really were. As such, Christiansen determined that there was no geological evidence to suggest the Sphinx was carved earlier than any other monuments on the Giza plateau. \n\nReader, who agrees that the Sphinx predates Khafra but prefers a construction date within the Early Dynastic Period, points to the tombs dug into the enclosure walls during Dynasty XXVI (\"c\". 600 BC), and notes that the entrances of the tombs have weathered so lightly that original chisel marks are still clearly visible. He points out that if the weathering on the enclosure walls (up to a metre deep in places) had been created by any of the proposed alternative causes of erosion, then the tomb entrances would have been weathered much more severely than they are in the modern day.\n\nIt is also agreed that wind erosion has played a significant role in eroding the Sphinx. Schoch states that wind erosion forms distinctive horizontal bands, whereas the water erosion features are clearly vertical.\n\nRecent studies by German climatologists Rudolph Kuper and Stefan Kröpelin, of the University of Cologne suggest the change from a wet to a much drier climate may have come to an end around 3500–1500 BC, which is as much as 500 years later than currently thought. Egyptologist Mark Lehner believes this climate change may have been responsible for the severe weathering found on the Sphinx and other sites of the 4th Dynasty. After studying sediment samples in the Nile Valley, Judith Bunbury, a geologist at the University of Cambridge, concluded that climate change in the Giza region may have begun early in the Old Kingdom, with desert sands arriving in force late in the era.\n\nSchoch points out that mudbrick mastabas on the Saqqara plateau about 20 km away, indisputably dated to Dynasties I and II, have survived relatively undamaged, which he believes indicates that no heavy rainfall has occurred in the region since the Early Dynastic Period, and nor was any heavy rain anticipated by those Early Dynastic Period communities who built those structures.\n\nReader replied to this, stating that they \"were built on an area of high ground and do not lie within any natural catchment. These tombs will not, therefore, have been exposed to any significant run-off.\" He concludes that \"the fact that they are not significantly degraded, as Schoch has pointed out, demonstrates that rainfall itself has not been a significant agent of degradation in Egypt.\" Rainfall water run-off, however, has been a more significant factor. Reader cites evidence of flood water damage in another location to illustrate this.\n\n\n"}

StoryCorps grew out of Sound Portraits Productions as a project founded in 2003 by radio producer David Isay. Its headquarters are located in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.\n\nStoryCorps is modeled—in spirit and in scope—after the efforts of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) of the 1930s, through which oral history interviews across the United States were recorded. Another inspiration for the organization was oral historian Studs Terkel, who cut the ribbon at the opening of StoryCorps’ first recording booth in Grand Central Terminal. To date, StoryCorps has recorded more than 60,000 interviews among more than 100,000 participants in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and several American territories.\n\nStoryCorps interviews usually take place between two people who know and care about each other. They can be friends, family, or mere acquaintances. A trained StoryCorps facilitator guides participants through the interview process. At the end of each 40-minute recording session, participants receive a complimentary CD of their interview and are requested to make a $50 donation to offset the recording costs. With participant permission, a second copy of each interview is archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress for future generations to hear. Segments of select interviews may air nationally on NPR’s \"Morning Edition\". These interviews can also be heard on the StoryCorps website.\n\nThere are several ways by which participants can record their stories.\n\nParticipants can visit StoryBooths, which are small, publicly accessible recording studios located in public places. The first StoryBooth opened in New York City’s Grand Central Terminal on October 23, 2003, and was moved to Lower Manhattan’s Foley Square in July 2005. The second StoryBooth opened at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco in October 2008. The third StoryBooth opened at Atlanta’s public radio station WABE in October 2009.\n\nIn May 2005, two StoryCorps MobileBooths built from converted Airstream trailers began traveling the country, recording stories in various cities year-round.\n\nStoryCorps offers three additional recordings services for those who are unable to visit a StoryCorps booth. The Door-to-Door service sends teams of StoryCorps facilitators to temporary recording locations throughout the United States for several days at a time. The StoryKit service ships a professional quality, portable recording device to participants around the country. The “Do-It-Yourself” service allows individuals to download free step-by-step interview instructions, equipment recommendations, and a “Great Question” list to conduct interviews using their own recording equipment.\n\nWith the support of the 2015 TED Prize and the 2014 Knight Prototype Fund, StoryCorps has developed a free app that allows users to record interviews on a smartphone. The app helps users prepare questions and provides tips for setting up the right recording environment. Users can upload their interviews to the StoryCorps.me website, and all interviews are archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The StoryCorps App and StoryCorps.me are currently in public beta.\n\nStoryCorps collaborates with groups, organizations, and institutions all over the country. Specifically, StoryCorps currently supports seven major initiatives that seek to reach out to the widest range of participants.\n\nStoryCorps currently has four community programs.\n\nStoryCorps has been criticized on multiple fronts. While it has been called been called “an oral history of America,” oral historians have critiqued the project’s methodology, specifically the \"highly sculpted techniques of the interviews\", such as the pre-scripted questions, the 40-minute time limit, and the presence of a StoryCorps staff member in the recording booth. The result of the technique is that interviews often elicit \"an often-rehearsed moment, story, or memory.\" \n\nHistorians are also critical of the post-interview editing process, which they argue favor highly emotional and predictable narrative arcs. StoryCorps stories typically feature tales of survival, which, as one historian has argued, perpetuates an “interpretive straightjacket of the neoliberal belief that people have their fates in their own hands.”\n\nStoryCorps has also been criticized for how its stories are framed on Morning Edition. For example, in a 2016 story, an elderly man confessed to having stolen $2 from his home that had been left for Pearl, his family’s female, African American domestic servant. When Pearl insisted that she had not been paid that week, she was fired. The title NPR gave the story - \"A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?\" - as well as Steve Inskeep’s closing request for listeners to help find Pearl drew ire from listeners, who found the sympathetic portrayal of the man to be misguided and offensive. One user wrote “waiting nearly a century to try to seek amends is horrific.” Another user suggested changing StoryCorps’ hashtag from #FindPearl to “FindJUSTICEforPearl.” In response to criticism, NPR acknowledged that “the segment comes across, even if this was not the attempt, as trying to manufacture a “feel good” feature.”\n\nStoryCorps has also published five books:\n\nIn 2007, StoryCorps was awarded a rare institutional award at the 66th Annual Peabody Awards. It won another Peabody Award in 2011 for StoryCorps' 9/11 Initiative.\n\nIn 2015, Dave Isay won the 2015 TED prize to fulfill his wish for people to have meaningful conversations worldwide using the StoryCorps app.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36784290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36784290", "title": "Sydor Rey", "text": "Sydor Rey\n\nSydor Rey born Izydor Reiss (6 September 1908 – 15 November 1979) was a Polish poet and novelist. During the Interbellum he worked in the Jewish orphanage of Janusz Korczak in Warsaw. He dedicated his short story \"Anioł-Stróż\" (\"Guardian Angel\"; 1957), part of his book \"Księga rozbitków\", to the memory of Janusz Korczak. A bisexual author, Sydor Rey did not frequently tackle gay subjects in his writings.\n\nSydor Rey was born in Wojniłów (now Voinyliv, Ukraine). He studied law and political science at the Lvov University and at Warsaw University. As a writer, Rey debuted in 1929. He was a member of the literary collective (\"zespół literacki\") \"Przedmieście\" in Warsaw. The first issue of the group's literary journal indicated that the association was established on the initiative of Helena Boguszewska (18861978) and Jerzy Kornacki (19081981) in JuneJuly 1933, with Bruno Schulz, Adolf Rudnicki, and Zofja Nałkowska among the invited founder members. Rudnicki had resigned from membership before the publication of their magazine in 1934, while Halina Krahelska and Sydor Rey were inducted as new members.\n\nThe group's name (\"przedmieście\", \"Pol.\" \"faubourg\") has been explained as referring both to the group's programmatic preoccupation with the marginalized aspects of the culture and social life in the Second Polish Republic, and to the connotation of \"outpost\" – hence by extension \"avant-garde\". The volume carried Sydor Rey's short story \"Królestwo Boże\" (\"The Kingdom of God\"), a fictional narrative of a visit to a privately owned factory by a friend of the proprietors. The visit becomes an occasion for remarkably detailed observations on the work conditions of the employees and their relations with the management, the government (represented by an industrial inspector), and the outside world.\n\nSydor Rey's first novel \"Kropiwniki\" was published in 1937. The title of the novel, \"Kropiwniki\", refers to the Polish provincial locality of Kropiwniki in the Volhynia (96 kilometres to the north of the Polish town of Włodzimierz Wołyński; since 1945 within the territory of the Ukrainian SSR), whose name the author uses as a cryptonym for his native Wojniłów, an ancient township founded in 1552 by the charter issued by Sigismund II Augustus. Its real identity thus concealed, the place serves as a canvas on which the author paints the history of three generations of inhabitants from various social classes and religious communities of Polish society, including Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians, representatives of the szlachta but also peasants, merchants, and artisans, thereby presenting an allegory on Polish society as a whole. Each of these various social groups, further subdivided in the book into additional subgroups and subtypes, espouses different and often conflicting sets of beliefs concerning social and political matters, whose beliefs moreover further mutate from generation to generation. While the author parades a plethora of various types of characters on his stage, from the szlachta individuals affecting a grand aristocratic manner, through lordlings enlightened by foreign studies enough to be able to fraternize with the working classes, to well-to-do Jewish businessmen, he devotes most space to the radicalizing poverty of the township and the impenetrable ignorance of the peasant masses of the surrounding villages, succeeding to depict this broad gallery of human types in particularly vivid brush strokes of great directness. Owing however to the well-nigh unmanageable breadth of the scope of his project, it has been observed by contemporary critics that the social doctrine on occasion takes precedence in his writing over art. The author Jerzy Andrzejewski (19091983) in literary magazine \"Prosto z mostu\", was even less kind, having seen in \"Kropiwniki\" an expression of the alleged Communist stance of an author squandering his talent in a doctrinaire enterprise of quixotic futility. Witold Gombrowicz too wrote a detailed and perhaps most considerate analysis of \"Kropiwniki\", arguing that it is the literary debuts that are more interesting, for all their inchoate form, than an author's later works which, though benefiting from the writer's more crystallized pattern of thought, in general tend to say little that is essentially new.\n\nRey also translated from the Yiddish into Polish the biographical novel on Karl Marx, \"Karl Marks (bay zayn shvel): byografisher montazsh-roman\" by the Polish writer Moisheh Grosman (19041961).\nBiographer Eugenia Prokop-Janiec of Jagiellonian University asserts that it was ultimately the pervasive antisemitism of the Polish society in the 1930s that forced the writers and poets like Sydor Rey and Henryka Łazowertówna (19091942), who never otherwise identified themselves as Jewish while working in the Polish language, to align themselves with the Jewish community for the first time. Sydor Rey's vignette entitled \"Spacer\" (\"A Walk\") deals with the thorny subject of race relations in a homoerotic context. It is a short text about a male couple who, taking a stroll in a public park, attract the attention of a gathering crowd not for being gay but for being of different races: the bystanders are not hostile to both characters as a couple, but in each case only to one of them – selected according to the particular bystander's \"own\" racial allegiance: the Gentiles in the crowd of onlookers are hostile to the man who looks Jewish, for they believe him to be somehow exploitative of his companion; the Jews in the crowd on the other hand are hostile to the Gentile believing him to be about to cause harm to his Jewish companion to whom they consequently feel obliged to offer assistance. Both men offer explanations to a policeman who arrives on the scene to institute \"ad hoc\" inquiry of his own into the commingling of the couple. The story is an allegory on the impossibility of normal relations between the races on a private level without public or official harassment, even as relations between (or within) the sexes are tolerated. A bisexual author, Sydor Rey did not frequently tackle gay subjects in his writings. His epigram \"Na plaży\" (On the Beach) is one of the exceptions.\n\nRey was one of the signatories of the open letter of the Polish writers against the bloody pacification by the Polish police of the workers' protests against the Sanacja régime in March 1936.\n\nOn the eve of the Second World War, in the spring of 1939 Sydor Rey emigrated from Warsaw to New York City, where he subsequently operated a second-hand bookshop. His wife and daughter left behind in Poland will perish in Cracow during the Holocaust. During his American period his writings appeared frequently in the Polish-language weekly newspaper \"Wiadomości: tygodnik\" (\"The News: A Weekly\") published in London, and in other émigré periodicals (while \"Commentary\" and the \"Transatlantic Review\" published translations in the United States). In his reply to a survey of Polish writers living in exile conducted by the \"Wiadomości\" of London in 1958, nearly twenty years after his departure from Poland, Rey revealed that every writer creatively active in exile is \"spiritually present\", in the act of creation, in his native land. Hence there are in reality no \"émigré writers\" and no \"émigré literatures\". He appended his literary testament with the following codicil.\n\nIf I, after well-nigh twenty years spent in the United States, have never thought for a moment of adopting English as my creative medium, it is because spiritually I continue to reside in my Homeland. The split involved here at times invests the written word of an author in exile with a terrifying beauty, which flows from his undaunted vision. But at the same time this split can, in the long run, lead to the degeneration of the creative faculty the most glaring case in point being that of the giant of Polish literature, Adam Mickiewicz. (...) [This happens] when a writer ceases to use the written word in the service of Beauty, as a building block in the project of constructing his own immaterial world, and starts using it as a magic charm invoked for the sake of transforming his immaterial world into a material one.\nAnd Rey clearly remained devoted to the Polish language for life, in the sort of intricate way of an impeccable stylist, as evidenced in his corrections of the minutiae in the prose of other writers or in the praise he generously showered on the dextrous use of the language in other cases, even of those who might not have been professional writers. He was listed by the \"Wiadomości\" of London among the Polish writers in exile who ought to be members of the Polish Academy of Literature were such an institution to be established (or rather revived). There is no evidence, on the other hand, that in the United States Rey found anything like a substitute for the land of his youth; in a poem entitled \"Miasto na Long Island\" (A City on Long Island) published in 1960 he speaks of a \"city flat and straight like a cadaver\", with street names invoking \"Indians that have been exterminated, running streams that have been filled in, hills that have been levelled down, and forests that have been felled\": what use to me this cemetery? he asks. \"Don't you know that I was born in a land where a white-winged horse would bend down to peer into my crib?\" In the poem \"Banita\" (The Banished One; 1961) Rey speaks of himself as a person deprived of speech, on account of his being \"a poet without a land\".\n\nDuring his exile in the United States he also chose to publish his books \"Księga rozbitków\" (\"The Book of the Shipwrecked\"; first edition, 1959) and \"Kropiwniki\" (second edition, 1962) in the then Communist-controlled Poland, where their publication would have been subject to (and has received) the advance approval of the censors. He also granted an interview to the Polish Radio in 1963, apparently on a visit to Warsaw (see Recordings).\n\n\"Księga rozbitków\" (\"The Book of the Shipwrecked\") is a collection of eighteen short stories that are, cumulatively, a psychological memoir of an author guilt-stricken for having passed the Holocaust in the physical safety of New York while being spiritually connected to the event as closely as or perhaps in some cases more closely than some of the victims, making the work something of a cross between a novel and a psychodrama \"cum\" a Gestalt therapy.\n\nSydor Rey's novel \"Ludzie miejscowi\" (\"The Folk of the Place\") was published in installments in the \"Wiadomości\" of London between 1962 and 1966 (see Works). While his writings in prose were praised for their astute psychological shadowing of characters and deep insights into the human condition, his poetry did not appeal to everyone. Marian Pankowski, reviewing his collection of poetry \"Własnymi słowami\" (\"In My Own Words\"; 1967), refused to apply the label of \"poetry\" to his verses, arguing that the colloquial and sometimes crude turn of phrase favoured by the author put his epigrams beyond the pale of art, while the consistent unsublimated directness of expression made it impossible to interpret this style as a literary conceit. Rey countered that the criticisms presented by Pankowski were illustrated by tendentiously selected quotations that did not constitute a representative sample and had been taken out of context, and that the overall method of extrapolating judgement of the whole \"oeuvre\" from bits and pieces was absurd, \"rather like presenting an audience with the bottom sliver of Cézanne's \"Bathing Women\" the figures cut off at the ankle and averring this fragment to possess 'some characteristics of Cézanne's painting style', only to dispatch the artist \"in toto\" with the dictum that 'the rest of his output is much in the same manner'\". Since Rey did not publish essays, his philosophical ideas found expression in his fiction, both in prose and in verse. Poems that deal directly or (sometimes) veiledly with the principal tenets of the Judaeo-Christian religious doctrine such as \"Bajka\" (Fairy Tale), \"Ojcze nasz\" (Our Father), or \"Raz kozie śmierć\" (Once a Death Befell a Goat) which quotes (in Hebrew) one of the Seven Last Words in the scornful context of a pastoral ditty may offend religious sensibilities, expressive as they are of his deep agnosticism and his radical questioning of the truth value of that doctrine.\n\nAs a literary critic, Sydor Rey believed that Boris Pasternak's novel \"Doctor Zhivago\" was deeply indebted to Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\", notwithstanding the fact of Hemingway's having been \"thick-skinned and effect-driven\" as opposed to Pasternak's qualities of fragile intelligence and delicacy. He was an admirer of the works of Thornton Wilder, to whom he dedicated a poem (entitled \"Festyn\" \"A Village Fair\"; translated in \"The Daily Orange\" in 1966 as \"Picnic\"), acknowledging his indebtedness in the writing of \"Księga rozbitków\" to the style of Wilder's play \"Our Town\".\n\nHis collected papers dating from the period between 1940 and 1969 The Sydor Rey Papers are preserved in the Special Collections Research Center of the Syracuse University Library in Syracuse, New York, having been donated to the institution by the Author in 1966. Some of his correspondence with Salo Wittmayer Baron is also preserved among the papers of the latter The Salo W. Baron Papers, 19001980 in the Department of Special Collections of Stanford University Libraries, while his correspondence with the renowned critic Michał Chmielowiec (19181974) is kept among the papers of the latter in the Archiwum Emigracji of the Nicolaus Copernicus University Library in Toruń.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n"}

Early books using syntax diagrams include the \"Pascal User Manual\" written by Niklaus Wirth (diagrams start at page 47) and the Burroughs CANDE Manual.. In the compilation field, textual representations like BNF or its variants are usually preferred. BNF is text-based, and used by compiler writers and parser generators. Railroad diagrams are visual, and may be more readily understood by laypeople, sometimes incorporated into graphic design. The canonical source defining the JSON data interchange format provides yet another example of a popular modern usage of these diagrams.\n\nThe representation of a grammar is made of a set of syntax diagrams. Each diagram defines a non-terminal. There is a main diagram which defines the language in the following way: to belong to the language, a word must describe a path in the main diagram.\n\nEach diagram has an entry point and an end point.

{"id": "610813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=610813", "title": "Tarnish", "text": "Tarnish\n\nTarnish is a thin layer of corrosion that forms over copper, brass, silver, aluminum, magnesium, neodymium and other similar metals as their outermost layer undergoes a chemical reaction. Tarnish does not always result from the sole effects of oxygen in the air. For example, silver needs hydrogen sulfide to tarnish, although it may tarnish with oxygen over time. It often appears as a dull, gray or black film or coating over metal. Tarnish is a surface phenomenon that is self-limiting, unlike rust. Only the top few layers of the metal react, and the layer of tarnish seals and protects the underlying layers from reacting.\n\nTarnish actually preserves the underlying metal in outdoor use, and in this form is called patina. The formation of patina is necessary in applications such as copper roofing, and outdoor copper, bronze, and brass statues and fittings. Patina is the name given to tarnish on copper based metals.\n\nTarnish is a product of a chemical reaction between a metal and a nonmetal compound, especially oxygen and sulfur dioxide. It is usually a metal oxide, the product of oxidation. Sometimes it is a metal sulfide. The metal oxide sometimes reacts with water to make the hydroxide; and carbon dioxide to make the carbonate. It is a chemical change.There are various methods to prevent metals from tarnishing.\nUsing a thin coat of polish can prevent tarnish from forming over these metals. Tarnish can be removed by using steel wool, sandpaper, emery paper, baking soda or a file to rub or polish the metal's dull surface. Fine objects (such as silverware) may have the tarnish electrochemically reversed (non-destructively) by resting the objects on a piece of aluminium foil in a pot of boiling water with a small amount of salt or baking soda, or it may be removed with a special polishing compound and a soft cloth. Gentler abrasives, like calcium carbonate, are often used by museums to clean tarnished silver as they cannot damage or scratch the silver and will not leave unwanted residues.\n\n"}

There have been many waves of migration of Roma out of Romania, some of them being connected to the 19th century abolition of slavery in Romania. This name was coined by British scholar Bernard Gilliat-Smith in his 1915 study on Bulgarian Roma, in which he first divided Roma dialects into Vlax and non-Vlax, based on whether they were influenced by Romanian or not.\n\nThe similarity of the words \"Romani\" and \"Romania\" is a coincidence, they are not etymologically related.\n\nVlax Romani is classified in two groups: Vlax I, or Northern Vlax (including Kalderash and Lovari), and Vlax II, or Southern Vlax.\n\nElšík uses this classification and dialect examples (geographical information from Matras ):\n\nVlax Romani is written using the Romani orthography, which is a Latin alphabet with several additional characters.
