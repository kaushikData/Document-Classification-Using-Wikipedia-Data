{"id": "418014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=418014", "title": "Box wine", "text": "Box wine\n\nBox wine (cask wine or boxed wine) is wine packaged in a bag-in-box. Wine is contained in a plastic bladder typically with an air-tight valve emerging from a protective corrugated fiberboard box. It serves as an alternative to traditional wine bottling in glass with a cork or synthetic seal. It is sometimes called goon , goon bag or \"Chateau Cardboard\" in Australia.\n\nThe process for packaging 'cask wine' (box wine) was invented by Thomas Angove, a winemaker from Renmark, South Australia, and patented by his company on April 20, 1965. Polyethylene bladders of 1 gallon (4.5 litres) were placed in corrugated boxes for retail sale. The original design required that the consumer cut the corner off the bladder, pour out the serving of wine and then reseal it with a special peg and was based on a product already on the market, which was a bag in a box used by mechanics to hold and transport battery acid.\n\nIn 1967, Australian inventor Charles Malpas and Penfolds Wines patented a plastic, air-tight tap welded to a metallised bladder, making storage more convenient. All modern wine casks now use some sort of plastic tap, which is exposed by tearing away a perforated panel on the box. For the next decades bag in a box packaging was primarily preferred by producers of less expensive wines as it is cheaper to fabricate and distribute than glass bottles.\n\nIn 2003, California Central Coast AVA–based Black Box Wines introduced mass premium wines in a box, which served to overturn the stereotype that box wines are an alternate packing on inexpensive jug wine. Within the decade premium wineries and bottlers began packaging their own high-quality boxed wine, including French rabbit, Bandit Wines, Octavin, Target, and hundreds of others. This coupled with an increased cultural interest in environmentally sustainable packaging has cultivated growing popularity with affluent wine consumers.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, the bag in box packaging concept expanded to other beverages including spring waters, orange juices, and wine coolers, however today wine and spring water are the main two beverages packed into these bags.\n\nBag-in-box packaging is less expensive, lighter and more environmentally friendly than glass-bottled wine, as well as being easier to transport and store. Typical bag-in-box containers hold one and a half to four 750 ml bottles of wine per box, though they come in a wide variety of volumes.\n\nThe fact that wine is removed from the flexible bag without adding air to fill the vacated space greatly reduces oxidation of the wine during dispensing. Compared to wine in a bottle which should be consumed within hours or days of opening, bag-in-box wine is not subject to cork taint and will not spoil for approximately 3–4 weeks after breaking the seal.\n\nWine contained in plastic bladders are not intended for cellaring and should be consumed within the manufacturer printed shelf life. Deterioration may be noticeable by 12 months after filling.\n\nIn a 2007 editorial in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", Adele Horin criticized the lower level of alcohol excise levied on cask wine in Australia (compared to beer and bottled wine), saying it encourages binge drinking.\n\n"}

{"id": "1203932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1203932", "title": "DVD recorder", "text": "DVD recorder\n\nA DVD recorder is an optical disc recorder that uses optical disc recording technologies to digitally record analog or digital signals onto blank writable DVD media. Such devices are available as either installable drives for computers or as standalone components for use in television studios or home theater systems.\n\nAs of March 1, 2007 all new tuner-equipped television devices manufactured or imported in the United States must include an ATSC tuner. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has interpreted this rule broadly, including apparatus such as computers with TV tuner cards with video capture ability, videocassette recorders and standalone DVD recorders. NTSC DVD recorders are undergoing a transformation, either adding a digital ATSC tuner or removing over-the-air broadcast television tuner capability entirely. However, these DVD recorders can still record analog audio and analog video.\n\nGiven the decline in popularity of DVDs, Magnavox, as of 2018, was the last manufacturer of stand-alone recorders (including a tuner).\n\nOriginally, DVD recorders supported one of three standards: DVD-RAM, DVD-RW (using DVD-VR), and DVD+RW (using DVD+VR), none of which are directly compatible. Most current DVD drives support both the + and - standards, while few support the DVD-RAM standard, which is not directly compatible with standard DVD drives.\n\nRecording speed is generally denoted in values of X (similar to CD-ROM usage), where 1X in DVD usage is equal to 1.321 MB/s, roughly equivalent to a 9X CD-ROM. In practice, this is largely confined to computer-based DVD recorders, since standalone units generally record in real time, that is, 1X speed.\n\nRecorders use a laser (usually 650 nm red) to read and write DVDs. The reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 mW, while the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The faster the writing speed is rated, the stronger the laser. DVD burner lasers often peak at about 100-400 mW in continuous wave (some are pulsed).\n\nDVD recorder drives are standard equipment in many computer systems on the market, after being initially popularized by the Pioneer/Apple SuperDrive; aftermarket drives can cost as little as $20. DVD recorder drives can be used in conjunction with DVD authoring software to create DVDs near or equal to commercial quality, and are also widely used for data backup and exchange. As a general rule, computer-based DVD recorders can also handle CD-R and CD-RW media; in fact, a number of standalone DVD recorders use drives designed for computers.\n\nMore recently, manufacturers have begun to phase out DVD drives from laptop computers in favor of portability and digital media.\n\nMost internal drives are designed with SATA interfaces, with parallel ATA becoming increasingly rare. External drives often use the USB standard for connectivity.\n\nDVD recorder drives manufactured since January 2000 are required by the DVD consortium to respect DVD region codes when reading a disc. The drives are incapable of assigning region codes when writing a disc as this is stored on a part of the disc to which PC based and standalone video recorders do not have write access.\n\nDVD duplication systems are generally built out of stacks of drives, connected through a computer-based backplane.\n\nWhen the standalone DVD recorder first appeared on the Japanese consumer market in 1999, early units were very expensive, costing between $2500 and $4000 USD. More recently, DVD recorders from notable brands have dropped in price. Early units supported only DVD-RAM and DVD-R discs, but newer units can record to DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL. Certain models include mechanical hard disk drive-based digital video recorders (DVRs) to improve ease of use. Standalone DVD recorders generally have basic DVD authoring software built in.\n\nIn 2009, Panasonic introduced the world's first Blu-ray disc recorder which was capable of recording both DVDs and Blu-ray discs and featured built in satellite HDTV tuners. A year later, Panasonic introduced Blu-ray disc recorders with terrestrial HDTV tuners.\n\nDVD recorders have technical advantages over VCRs, including: \n\n\nNote: Blu-ray disc recorders can record full high definition videos on BD-Rs and BD-REs.\n\nDisadvantages include: \n\n\nIn addition, DVDs recorded with DVD recorders in the standard DVD format must be finalized to view in other DVD players. This disadvantage does not apply to discs recorded in the newer and more flexible DVD-VR format or the DVD+VR format - the latter (but not the former) also being compatible with DVD players. The implementation of MPEG-2 compression used on most standalone DVD recorders is required to compress the picture data in real time, producing results that may not be up to par with professionally rendered DVD video, which can take days to compress.\n\nStandard definition VCR replacement DVD video recorders typically has a set of standard recording modes for fitting 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 hour modes (XP, SP, LP, EP, SLP, SEP, respectively) on single layer 12cm discs (DVD5). These modes are comparable to those found on VHS VCRs using standard 120-tapes, having SP, LP, SLP modes of 2, 4, 6 hour.\n\nThe United States converted its over-the-air television broadcasts to digital \"ATSC\" in June 2009. This will have a limited impact in ending the need for DVD recorders to perform realtime MPEG-2 encoding or transcoding. The only setup where ATSC could eliminate MPEG-2 encoding/transcoding in a DVD recorder would be where an antenna is hooked directly into a DVD recorder that has an integrated ATSC tuner. However, the DVD recorder will have to transcode the ATSC MPEG-2 into DVD-Video-compliant MPEG-2 if the ATSC MPEG-2 stream isn't already DVD-Video-compatible. This would require transcoding for all high-definition broadcasts and some if not all standard-definition broadcasts. The same general situation applies to digital cable service; only DVD recorders with integrated digital cable (\"QAM\") tuners can avoid transcoding, and then only if the digital cable system is already sending a DVD-Video-compatible MPEG-2 stream, which again requires transcoding of all HD content and some if not all SD content. All other setups (digital cable box's analog outputs to DVD recorder, satellite box's analog outputs to DVD recorder, DVD recorder tuning and recording analog cable channels which are still permitted after 2/2009, etc.) usually always involve an analog step with MPEG-2 encoding being necessary inside the DVD recorder.\n\nA number of manufacturers have combined DVD recorders with mechanical hard disk drive-based digital video recorders, allowing for recording to large fixed disks, and the ability to view these recordings off the hard disk at a later date.\n\nIn Japan, AVCREC recorders, which are able to record MPEG-2 or AVC high definition video from ISDB broadcast with or without re-encoding, get increasingly popular. Initially, AVCREC recorders use DVD recordable discs, but newer models are able to record onto Blu-ray discs as well onto hard disk drives.\n\nAs a result of the North American digital switchover, tuner-equipped devices manufactured or imported into the United States are now required by the US Federal Communications Commission to include digital tuners.\n\nThis has caused most new VHS recorders to be implemented as DVD/VCR combo units, or to be manufactured without tuners. The US requirement of ATSC compatibility forces inclusion of MPEG-2 decoding hardware, which is already part of all DVD players but which otherwise would be unnecessary in an analog-only VCR.\n\nAn ATSC-capable DVD unit can also serve as a more-powerful alternative to digital television adapters, which allow DTV reception with older NTSC analog televisions. The DVD recorders offer additional capabilities, such as automated VCR-style timeshifting of programming and a variety of output formats, that are deliberately not included in the most common mass-market US ATSC converters.\n\nUnlike the more common digital television adapter boxes, newer DVD recorder units are able to tune both analog and digital signals - an advantage when receiving low-power television and foreign (analogue) signals. Some, however, do suffer from many of the same design limitations as the less costly converter boxes, including poorly designed signal strength meters, incomplete display of broadcast program information, incompatibility with antenna rotators or CEA-909 smart antennas and inability to add digital channels without wiping out all existing channels and rescanning the entire band.\n\nA DVD recording of an over-the-air HDTV broadcast is at DVD resolution, which is inferior to the original broadcast with 720p or 1080i resolution. Some units also provide limited USB or flash memory interface capability, often only supporting viewing of digital camera still photos or playback of MP3s with no ability to write video to these media.\n\nA number of DVD recorders are also capable of recording to SVCD, VCD and Audio CD formats. Recording to DVDs can be done at different speeds that may take between 1 and 6 hours (even up to 8 hours on certain models) on a standard (single sided 12 cm) blank DVD. A trade off exists between recording time and video quality.\n\n8 cm miniDVDs are used on some digital camcorders, primarily those meant for a consumer market (\"point and shoot\"); such discs are usually playable on a full-sized DVD player, but may not record on a full-sized DVD recorder system. Though popular for their convenience (in the manner of VHS-C), DVD camcorders are not suitable for professional use due to higher levels of compression compared to MiniDV and the difficulty of editing MPEG-2 video.\n\n"}

{"id": "335429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335429", "title": "Dutton Speedwords", "text": "Dutton Speedwords\n\nDutton Speedwords, sometimes called rapmotz , is an international auxiliary language as well as a shorthand writing system for all the languages of the world. It was invented by Reginald J. G. Dutton (1886–1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935 under the title \"International Symbolic Script\" and a year later using the name \"Speedwords\". Revisions were made and published in 1946 and 1951.\n\nThe dual function of being both an international language and a shorthand system was intended as a way of encouraging more people to see the value of the method. The original Dutton Speedwords manuals are now out of print, but the method has seen a revival since the start of the 21st century, as its applications in online work have become noted, such as the benefit of using a shorthand method for typing e-mail.\n\nUnlike other shorthand methods, such as Pitman's shorthand, the Speedwords method uses ordinary Roman letters to represent the semantic qualities of words rather than using new symbols. This means it can be typed using a normal keyboard.\nThe vocabulary of Speedwords uses many international words and compressed forms of the writer's own language.\n\nDutton claimed that Speedwords was \"the first abbreviated writing invention in history which at once transcribes all languages\", though really its lexicon only fits the English it was patterned after.\n\nDutton conceived Speedwords not only as a system of shorthand but as an auxiliary spoken language; thus, he provided rules of pronunciation.\n\nThe principle behind the choice of word roots of Dutton Speedwords is the maxim that frequently used words should be shorter than seldom-used words in order to speed up communication (see information theory). There are 493 one-, two- and three-letter roots. The 46 most frequent English words are equated with 27 one-letter Speedword roots:\n\nSome two- and three-letter words are\n\nThe few hundred roots are combined through the use of affixes to expand vocabulary. For example: the affix \"-a\" indicates an unfavorable connotation to the root-word; thus, \"bixy\" = kill, \"bixya\" = murder. Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as \"ky + luf\" (eat + air) to mean \"picnic\". Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter \"r\" indicates future tense and \"y\" indicates past. Thus, \"j sa\" = I know, \"j ysa\" = I knew, \"j r sa\" = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (\"bel\" = \"beautiful\" and \"beautifully\"). Compounds follow a headnoun-modifier sequence, as in \"ca + dor\" (room + sleep) = bedroom.\n\nDutton orthography is irregular. It is combined with phonology below.\n\nStress is on the first syllable (first vowel), except that the opposite suffix \"-o\" is always stressed, and the prefixes \"u-\" and past \"y-\" are never stressed.\n\nVowels are rather similar to Latin. When a vowel occurs at the end of a morpheme or before another vowel, it is long, otherwise it is usually short (though some suffixes shorten a preceding morpheme-final vowel).\n\nVowel length is only phonemic in a few cases where a root contrasts with a suffixed word, with suffixes that do not shorten the vowel. For example,\n\nOnly \"au\" and \"y\" are diphthongs. Other sequences of vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, e.g. \"eis\" \"ice\" is . Vowel sequences in roots are \"ei, eu, oi, oe, ui, ue, ia, io, iu\". The sequences \"ie, uo\" are found in written contractions, but may not be pronounced that way.\n\n\"Y\" is a consonant in \"ye\" \"yes\" and in \"y\" \"was, were\". (The diphthong \"y\" never appears next to another vowel within a root, so the pronunciation of the letter \"y\" in \"ye\" is predictable.)\n\nConsonants are mostly as in the IPA; e.g., \"s\" is always voiceless, as in \"less\", \"g\" is always hard, as in \"get\", and \"r\" is trilled, as in Scots and Italian. Exceptions:\n\nWords spelled as a single consonant are usually pronounced as that consonant plus a \"very short ee\" before a vowel, and as that consonant + schwa otherwise. (This epenthetic vowel parallels the pronunciation of \"e\" in the English word \"the\".) The suffixes \"-r\" (agent) and \"-z\" (plural) are pronounced with a preceding schwa when they follow a consonant.\n\nConsonant sequences in word-initial position are \"bl, br, pl, pr, dr, tr, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr, sl, q\" [kw], \"sp, st\". The only consonant sequence in root-medial position is \"tt\" in \"otto\" \"eight\". Consonant sequences in word-final position are \"nd, nt, ng, lk, rb, rd, rt, rg, rk, rm, rn, st, sk, x\" [ks], and \"q\" [kw] (in \"aq\" \"water\").\n\nSome morphemes spelled with a single consonant have an unwritten vowel, and one prefix spelled with a single vowel has an unwritten consonant:\n\nSome suffixes have an unwritten vowel that only occurs after certain consonants. They are detailed below.\n\nAs noted above, the prefixes past-tense \"y-\" and \"u-\" do not take stress, and \"u-\" is pronounced with an unwritten engma. \"Me-\" and \"my-\" are regular.\n\nSuffixed vowels are long and take an epenthetic (English \"y\") when following a vowel. For example, \"dau\" \"allow, grant\" (< \"da + u\") is pronounced , \"gan\" \"scarcely\" (< \"ga + n\") is , and \"rist\" \"clerk\" (< \"ri + st\") is .\n\nSuffixes pronounced as a single consonant after a vowel generally shorten that vowel. The exceptions are \"-d, -z, -r\", which leave the vowel long. (As noted above, \"-z\" and \"-r\" take an epenthetic schwa after any consonant.) Many consonants are pronounced with an unwritten vowel after certain consonants:\n\nIn addition, three suffixes have completely different forms after consonants and vowels:\n\nBesides the epenthetic vowels mentioned above, many suffixes take epenthetic vowels (or their other alternative form) to avoid homophones. More generally, the suffix \"-s\" takes its epenthetic after \"k\" and \"g\" to prevent confusion with final \"x\", regardless of whether this would create a homophone.\n\nUsually, the root-plus-suffix is written the same as the potential homophone, and only pronounced differently. For example, \"-m\" is pronounced after consonants, and after vowels when a pronunciation of would create a homophone, but it is always written \"-m\". On the other hand, \"-v\", \"-f\", and \"-x\" after a vowel are replaced with their post-consonantal forms \"-i\", \"-y\", and \"-o\" when their normal post-vocalic forms would create a homophone; here the difference is reflected in both pronunciation and writing (though the epenthetic is still not written). One suffix, \"-r\" (agent suffix, as English \"-er\"), has a special disambiguating form:\n\n\nWhen two roots form a compound, the unwritten affix is placed after the first root. When three roots form a compound, the unwritten affix is placed after the first root. Either affix takes an epenthetic after a consonant. Examples:\n\nMany roots function as either noun or verb:\n\nThe past tense of most verbs is marked by the unstressed prefix \"y-\" . Two verbs are irregular: \n\nThe possessive of nouns is , and written with an apostrophe: \n\n\n\n\n"}

It can be formulated as\n\nwhere \"V\" is the number of distinct words in an instance text of size \"n\". \"K\" and β are free parameters determined empirically. With English text corpora, typically \"K\" is between 10 and 100, and β is between 0.4 and 0.6.\n\nThe law is frequently attributed to Harold Stanley Heaps, but was originally discovered by . Under mild assumptions, the Herdan–Heaps law is asymptotically equivalent to Zipf's law concerning the frequencies of individual words within a text. This is a consequence of the fact that the type-token relation (in general) of a homogenous text can be derived from the distribution of its types.\n\nHeaps' law means that as more instance text is gathered, there will be diminishing returns in terms of discovery of the full vocabulary from which the distinct terms are drawn.\n\nHeaps' law also applies to situations in which the \"vocabulary\" is just some set of distinct types which are attributes of some collection of objects. For example, the objects could be people, and the types could be country of origin of the person. If persons are selected randomly (that is, we are not selecting based on country of origin), then Heaps' law says we will quickly have representatives from most countries (in proportion to their population) but it will become increasingly difficult to cover the entire set of countries by continuing this method of sampling.\n\n"}
{"id": "21073209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21073209", "title": "Hypothesis", "text": "Hypothesis\n\nA hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research, in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought. \n\nA different meaning of the term \"hypothesis\" is used in formal logic, to denote the antecedent of a proposition; thus in the proposition \"If \"P\", then \"Q\"\", \"P\" denotes the hypothesis (or antecedent); \"Q\" can be called a consequent. \"P\" is the assumption in a (possibly counterfactual) \"What If\" question.\n\nThe adjective \"hypothetical\", meaning \"having the nature of a hypothesis\", or \"being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis\", can refer to any of these meanings of the term \"hypothesis\".\n\nIn its ancient usage, \"hypothesis\" referred to a summary of the plot of a classical drama. The English word \"hypothesis\" comes from the ancient Greek ὑπόθεσις word \"hupothesis\", meaning \"to put under\" or \"to suppose\".\n\nIn Plato's \"Meno\" (86e–87b), Socrates dissects virtue with a method used by mathematicians, that of \"investigating from a hypothesis.\" In this sense, 'hypothesis' refers to a clever idea or to a convenient mathematical approach that simplifies cumbersome calculations. Cardinal Bellarmine gave a famous example of this usage in the warning issued to Galileo in the early 17th century: that he must not treat the motion of the Earth as a reality, but merely as a hypothesis.\n\nIn common usage in the 21st century, a \"hypothesis\" refers to a provisional idea whose merit requires evaluation. For proper evaluation, the framer of a hypothesis needs to define specifics in operational terms. A hypothesis requires more work by the researcher in order to either confirm or disprove it. In due course, a confirmed hypothesis may become part of a theory or occasionally may grow to become a theory itself. Normally, scientific hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model. Sometimes, but not always, one can also formulate them as existential statements, stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon under examination has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of universal statements, stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.\n\nIn entrepreneurial science, a hypothesis is used to formulate provisional ideas within a business setting. The formulated hypothesis is then evaluated where either the hypothesis is proven to be \"true\" or \"false\" through a verifiability- or falsifiability-oriented experiment.\n\nAny useful hypothesis will enable predictions by reasoning (including deductive reasoning). It might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature. The prediction may also invoke statistics and only talk about probabilities. Karl Popper, following others, has argued that a hypothesis must be falsifiable, and that one cannot regard a proposition or theory as scientific if it does not admit the possibility of being shown false. Other philosophers of science have rejected the criterion of falsifiability or supplemented it with other criteria, such as verifiability (e.g., verificationism) or coherence (e.g., confirmation holism). The scientific method involves experimentation, to test the ability of some hypothesis to adequately answer the question under investigation. In contrast, unfettered observation is not as likely to raise unexplained issues or open questions in science, as would the formulation of a crucial experiment to test the hypothesis. A thought experiment might also be used to test the hypothesis as well.\n\nIn framing a hypothesis, the investigator must not currently know the outcome of a test or that it remains reasonably under continuing investigation. Only in such cases does the experiment, test or study potentially increase the probability of showing the truth of a hypothesis. If the researcher already knows the outcome, it counts as a \"consequence\" — and the researcher should have already considered this while formulating the hypothesis. If one cannot assess the predictions by observation or by experience, the hypothesis needs to be tested by others providing observations. For example, a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible.\n\nPeople refer to a trial solution to a problem as a hypothesis, often called an \"educated guess\" because it provides a suggested outcome based on the evidence. However, some scientists reject the term \"educated guess\" as incorrect. Experimenters may test and reject several hypotheses before solving the problem.\n\nAccording to Schick and Vaughn, researchers weighing up alternative hypotheses may take into consideration:\n\nA working hypothesis is a hypothesis that is provisionally accepted as a basis for further research in the hope that a tenable theory will be produced, even if the hypothesis ultimately fails.\nLike all hypotheses, a working hypothesis is constructed as a statement of expectations, which can be linked to the exploratory research purpose in empirical investigation. Working hypotheses are often used as a conceptual framework in qualitative research.\n\nThe provisional nature of working hypotheses make them useful as an organizing device in applied research. Here they act like a useful guide to address problems that are still in a formative phase.\n\nIn recent years, philosophers of science have tried to integrate the various approaches to evaluating hypotheses, and the scientific method in general, to form a more complete system that integrates the individual concerns of each approach. Notably, Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend, Karl Popper's colleague and student, respectively, have produced novel attempts at such a synthesis.\n\nConcepts in Hempel's deductive-nomological model play a key role in the development and testing of hypotheses. Most formal hypotheses connect concepts by specifying the expected relationships between propositions. When a set of hypotheses are grouped together they become a type of conceptual framework. When a conceptual framework is complex and incorporates causality or explanation it is generally referred to as a theory. According to noted philosopher of science Carl Gustav Hempel \"An adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory: The hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena. Frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory; but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived.\"\n\nHempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between a conceptual framework and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested (interpreted framework). \"The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretative connections, the network can function as a scientific theory.\" Hypotheses with concepts anchored in the plane of observation are ready to be tested. In \"actual scientific practice the process of framing a theoretical structure and of interpreting it are not always sharply separated, since the intended interpretation usually guides the construction of the theoretician.\" It is, however, \"possible and indeed desirable, for the purposes of logical clarification, to separate the two steps conceptually.\"\n\nWhen a possible correlation or similar relation between phenomena is investigated, such as whether a proposed remedy is effective in treating a disease, the hypothesis that a relation exists cannot be examined the same way one might examine a proposed new law of nature. In such an investigation, if the tested remedy shows no effect in a few cases, these do not necessarily falsify the hypothesis. Instead, statistical tests are used to determine how likely it is that the overall effect would be observed if the hypothesized relation does not exist. If that likelihood is sufficiently small (e.g., less than 1%), the existence of a relation may be assumed. Otherwise, any observed effect may be due to pure chance.\n\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, two hypotheses are compared. These are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that states that there is no relation between the phenomena whose relation is under investigation, or at least not of the form given by the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis, as the name suggests, is the alternative to the null hypothesis: it states that there \"is\" some kind of relation. The alternative hypothesis may take several forms, depending on the nature of the hypothesized relation; in particular, it can be two-sided (for example: there is \"some\" effect, in a yet unknown direction) or one-sided (the direction of the hypothesized relation, positive or negative, is fixed in advance).\n\nConventional significance levels for testing hypotheses (acceptable probabilities of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis) are .10, .05, and .01. The significance level for deciding whether the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted must be determined in advance, before the observations are collected or inspected. If these criteria are determined later, when the data to be tested are already known, the test is invalid.\n\nThe above procedure is actually dependent on the number of the participants (units or sample size) that are included in the study. For instance, to avoid having the sample size be too small to reject a null hypothesis, it is recommended that one specify a sufficient sample size from the beginning. It is advisable to define a small, medium and large effect size for each of a number of important statistical tests which are used to test the hypotheses.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16173656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16173656", "title": "Kiowa phonology", "text": "Kiowa phonology\n\nThe most thorough treatment of the Kiowa sound system is by Laurel Watkins in a generative framework. A consideration of prosodic phenomena with acoustic analysis is in Sivertsen (1956). Earlier discussions of phonemics are Trager (1960), Merrifield (1959), Wonderly et al. (1954), and Harrington (1928).\n\nThe 23 consonants of Kiowa:\n\nIn the orthography (used here) of the native Kiowa speaker, Parker McKenzie, who collaborated with both J.P. Harrington and Laurel Watkins, these are represented as below (parenthetic letters are used only at the end of the syllable):\n\n\nKiowa has six contrasting vowel qualities with three heights and a front-back distinction. Additionally, there is an oral-nasal contrast on all six vowels. For example, nasality is the only difference between \"ā́u\" ('to gamble') and \"ā́u\" ('to give').\n\nThe oral-nasal contrast, however, is neutralized in the environment of nasal consonants, where only nasalized vowels occur. Watkins phonemicizes an oral vowel in these contexts: \"mā́\" ('up') is phonetically , \"máun\" ('probably') is phonetically .\n\nKiowa vowels have an underlying two-way length contrast (short vs. long). However, a number of phonological issues restrict the length contrast. (See the syllable and phonotactics for details.)\n\nKiowa has three tones: \"high\", \"low\", \"falling\". No minimal triple is available, but the distinctions can be illustrated pairwise: \"à\" ~ \"á\" (agreement prefixes for 1sg and 3pl unaccusatives), \"ḕ\" ('when') ~ \"ḗ\" ('here'); \"àl\" ('also)' ~ \"âl\" ('chase' perfective imperative), \"chḕ\" ('when') ~ \"chê\" ('horse'); \"cául\" ('cattle')~ \"câul\" ('some'), \"gṹ\"('wise') ~ \"gû\" ('hit'). Note that length is not indicated on vowels with falling tone in the current orthography: this is because falling tone is generally only realized over long vowels or a vowel plus resonant (, , , or ). However, there are at least two words with falling tone realized before , both of them minimally contrastive with high tone: \"bót\" ('guts') ~ \"bôt\" ('because'), \"chát\" ('door') ~ \"chât\" ('cheque'). This behaviour contrasts with ; suffixation of to verbs with falling tone causes the vowel to shorten and become simply high, as in root ~ perfective pairs \"gû\" ~ \"góp\" ('hit'), \"kî\" ~ \"tép\" ('exit'). One speaker has been recorded with the pronunciation ('big') in contrast to other speakers' (the compounding form, \"êl\", as in \"êlmā̀\" 'old woman', has falling tone).\n\nThe falling tone has glottalized realizations (creaky voice, tense voice, with glottal stop) in some contexts.\n\nThere are also a number of tone sandhi effects.\n\nSurface syllables in Kiowa must consist of a vowel nucleus. Syllable onsets are optional and can consist of single consonant or a consonant followed by a palatal glide . A single vowel may be followed by an optional syllable coda consonant or the vowel may optionally be long. Thus, the following syllables are found in Kiowa: . This can be succinctly represented as the syllable equation below.\n\nA number of phonotactic restrictions are found limiting the possible combinations of sounds. These are discussed below.\n\nOnset. All consonants can occurs as a single consonant onset. However, only occurs word-initially in loan words (e.g., \"láyàn\" 'lion', \"Láut\" 'Lawton').\n\nNucleus. The syllable nucleus can be any vowel, which can be either short or long.\n\nCoda. The coda position may be filled only by . Palatal only follows the vowels (i.e. the palatal may not occur after non-low front vowels).\n\n\n\n"}

The rhetoric of left-wing populism often consists of anti-elitist sentiments, opposition to the Establishment and speaking for the \"common people\". The important themes for left-wing populists usually include anti-capitalism, social justice, pacifism and anti-globalization, whereas class society ideology or socialist theory is not as important as it is to traditional left-wing parties. The criticism of capitalism and globalization is linked to anti-militarism, which has increased in the left populist movements as a result of unpopular United States military operations, especially those in the Middle East. It is considered that the populist left does not exclude others horizontally and relies on egalitarian ideals. Some scholars point out nationalist left-wing populist movements as well, a feature exhibited by Kemalism in Turkey for instance. For left-wing populist parties supportive of minority rights among others, the term \"inclusionary populism\" has been used.\n\nWith the rise of Greek Syriza and Spanish Podemos during the European debt crisis, there has been increased debate on new left-wing populism in Europe.\n\nMany leftist and populist political parties in Europe belong to the European United Left–Nordic Green Left.\n\nThe Party of Democratic Socialism was explicitly studied under left-wing populism, especially by German academics. The party was formed after the reunification of Germany and it was similar to right-wing populists in that it relied on anti-elitism and media attention provided by a charismatic leadership. The party competed for the same voter base with the right-wing populists to some extent, although it relied on a more serious platform in Eastern Germany. This was limited by anti-immigration sentiments preferred by some voters, although the lines were for example crossed by Oskar Lafontaine, who used a term previously associated with the Nazi Party, \"Fremdarbeiter\" (\"foreign workers\"), in his election campaign in 2005. The PDS merged into the Left Party in 2007.\n\nSyriza, which became the largest party since January 2015 elections, has been described as a left-wing populist party after their platform incorporated most demands of the popular movements in Greece during the government-debt crisis. Populist traits in Syriza's platform include growing importance of \"the People\" in their rhetoric and \"us/the people against them/the establishment\" antagonism in campaigning. On immigration and LGBT rights, Syriza is inclusionary. Syriza itself does not accept the label \"populist\".\n\nThe Socialist Party has run a left-wing populist platform after dropping its communist course in 1991. Although some have pointed out that the party has become less populist over the years, it still includes anti-elitism in its recent election manifestos. It opposes what it sees as the European superstate.\n\nThe left-wing populist party Podemos achieved 8 percent of the national vote in the 2014 European Parliament election. Due to avoiding nativist language typical with right-wing populists, Podemos is able to attract all leftist voters disappointed with the political establishment without taking sides in the regional political struggle. At the 2015 election for the national parliament, Podemos reached 20.65% of the vote and became the third largest party in the parliament after the conservative People's Party with 28.71% and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party with 22.02%. In the new parliament, Podemos holds 69 out of 350 seats and this result ended the traditional two-party system of Spain. In a November 2018 interview with Jacobin magazine, Íñigo Errejón argues that Podemos requires a new \"national-popular\" strategy in order to win more elections.\n\nAnova–Nationalist Brotherhood is a Galician nationalist left-wing party that supports Galician independence from the Spanish government. In addition to national liberation, Anova defines itself as a socialist, feminist, ecologist and internationalist organization. Its internal organization is run by assemblies.\n\nCristina Fernández de Kirchner (the President of Argentina from 2007 to 2015) and her husband Néstor Kirchner were said to practice Kirchnerism, a variant of Peronism that was often mentioned alongside other early 21st century Latin American left-wing populist movements in Boliva and Venezuela. During Cristina Fernández de Kirchner time in office, she often engaged in criticism of the United States, gave speeches with anti-globalization overtones and sought to form economic alliances with non-Western countries such as China and Russia, with some degree of success. She has also repeatedly spoken against capitalism in general. Her administration was characterized by marked tax increases, especially on agricultural produce, Argentina's main export. In 2009, she instated the universal allocation per child subsidy (commonly referred to as AUH in Argentina, \"Asignación Universal por Hijo\"), a means-tested benefit to families with children who qualified for the program (despite its name, the AUH is not a universal subsidy).\n\nThe leadership of Siles Zuazo practiced left-wing populism as well as that of incumbent socialist President Evo Morales.\n\nRafael Correa, the President of Ecuador, has stressed the importance of a \"populist discourse\" and has integrated technocrats to work within this context for the common Ecuadorians. In the conflict between the indigenous peoples and the government, Correa has blamed foreign non-governmental organizations for exploiting the indigenous people.\n\nThe presidency of Hugo Chávez resembled a combination of folk wisdom and charismatic leadership with doctrinaire socialism. Chávez's government was also described to have been a \"throwback\" to populist nationalism and redistributivism.\n\n2016 presidential candidate and Senator Bernie Sanders has been described as a populist.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has been described as a populist.\n\n\n\n"}

It is spoken mostly in Somalia and adjacent parts of Ethiopia and Kenya. Its speakers are known as Sab Somalis. The centre of the dialect is around Baidoa. The dialect is written using the Latin script.\n\nSomali linguistic varieties are divided into three main groups: Northern, Benadir and Maay.

Its speech area extends from the southwestern border with Ethiopia to a region close to the coastal strip between Mogadishu and Kismayo, including the city of Baidoa. Maay is not mutually comprehensible with Northern Somali or Benadir, and it differs considerably in sentence structure and phonology. It is also not generally used in education or media. However, Maay speakers often use Standard Somali as a lingua franca, which is learned via mass communications, internal migration and urbanisation.\n\nMaay Maay exhibits significant amounts of epenthesis, inserting central or high-central vowels to break up consonant clusters. Vowel length is contrastive; minimal pairs such as \"bur\" 'flour' and \"buur\" 'mountain' are attested.\n\nMaay Maay is fairly agglutinative. It has complex verb forms, inflecting at least for tense/aspect and person/number of both subject and object. There is also a prefix indicating negation.

Consider the following sentence, where neither the subject nor object shows any case (Gerzenstein 1995:139):\n\nNouns agree with their possessor in person (Gerzenstein 1995:148):\n\nVerbs agree with their subject and object in a rather complex system.

The following two examples show intransitive verbs from conjugation classes 1 and 3.\n\nTransitive verbs belong to a different conjugation class, Conjugation 6. The following forms show a transitive verb with a 3rd person object:\n\nIf the object of the transitive verb is 1st or 2nd person, then certain combinations of subject and object are shown by a portmanteau morpheme.\n\nOther combinations involve an object agreement marker which may either precede or follow the subject marker (Gerzenstein 1995:94-101):\n\nVerbs in Maká have a series of suffixes called 'postpositions' in Gerzenstein (1995), which have the effect of introducing new oblique objects into the sentence.\n\nThe following examples show the applicative suffixes -ex 'instrumental ('with')' and -m 'benefactive ('for')'\n\nIn noun phrases, the possessor precedes the possessed noun (Gerzenstein 1995:155):\n\nNoun phrases show the order (Demonstrative) (Numeral) (Adjective) N (Gerzenstein 1995:154):\n\nThe basic word order for a transitive clause in Maká is subject–verb–object, as seen in the following example (Gerzenstein 1995:138)\n\nFor intransitive clauses, the basic order is verb-subject (Gerzenstein 1995:106):\n\nIn yes-no questions, the usual subject–verb–object order changes to verb-subject-object following an initial particle /me/ (Gerzenstein 1995:136):\n\nSentences with wh-questions show a sentence-initial question word. Maká has a very small inventory of question words, with only three members: \"łek\" 'who, what', \"pan\" 'which, where, how many', and \"inhats'ek\" 'why'. The following example shows an interrogative sentence with an initial question word (Gerzenstein 1995:178:\n\n"}

{"id": "2304475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304475", "title": "Nahuan languages", "text": "Nahuan languages\n\nThe Nahuan or Aztecan languages are those languages of the Uto-Aztecan language family that have undergone a sound change, known as Whorf's law, that changed an original *t to before *a. Subsequently, some Nahuan languages have changed this to or back to , but it can still be seen that the language went through a stage. The best known Nahuan language is Nahuatl.\n\nSome authorities, such as the Mexican government, \"Ethnologue,\" and \"Glottolog,\" consider the varieties of modern Nahuatl to be distinct languages, because they are often mutually unintelligible and their speakers have distinct ethnic identities. As of 2008, the Mexican government recognizes thirty varieties that are spoken in Mexico as languages (see the list below).\n\nResearchers distinguish between several dialect areas that each have a number of shared features: One classification scheme distinguishes innovative central dialects, spoken around Mexico City, from conservative peripheral ones spoken north, south and east of the central area, while another scheme distinguishes a basic split between western and eastern dialects. Nahuan languages include not just varieties known as Nahuatl, but also Pipil and the extinct Pochutec language.\n\nThe differences among the varieties of Nahuatl are not trivial, and in many cases result in low or no mutual intelligibility: people who speak one variety cannot understand or be understood by those from another. Thus, by that criterion, they could be considered different languages. The ISO divisions referenced below respond to intelligibility more than to historical or reconstructional considerations. Like the higher-level groupings, they also are not self-evident and are subject to considerable controversy.\n\nNevertheless, the variants all are clearly related and more closely related to each other than to Pochutec, and they and Pochutec are more closely related to each other than to any other Uto-Aztecan languages (such as Cora or Huichol, Tepehuán and Tarahumara, Yaqui/Mayo, etc.)\n\nLittle work has been done in the way of the historical linguistics of Nahuatl proper or the Aztecan (nowadays often renamed Nahuan) branch of Uto-Aztecan.\n\nLyle Campbell and Ronald W. Langacker (1978), in a paper whose focus was the internal reconstruction of the vowels of Proto-Aztecan (or Proto-Nahuan), made two proposals of lasting impact regarding the internal classification of the Aztecan branch. They introduced the claim, which would quickly be received as proven beyond virtually any doubt, that the well known change of Proto-Uto-Aztecan */ta-/ to */t͡ɬa-/ was a development in Proto-Aztecan (Proto-Nahuan), not a later development in some dialects descended from Proto-Aztecan. Second, they adduced new arguments for dividing the branch in two subdivisions: Pochutec, whose sole member is the Pochutec language, which became extinct sometime in the 20th century, and General Aztec, which includes the Pipil language and all dialects spoken in Mexico which are clearly closely related to the extinct literary language, Classical Nahuatl. This binary division of Aztecan (Nahuan) was already the majority opinion among specialists, but Campbell and Langacker's new arguments were received as being compelling. Furthermore, in \"adopt[ing] the term 'General Aztec' \", they may in fact have been the ones to introduce this designation. Part of their reconstruction of the Proto-Aztecan vowels was disputed by Dakin (1983).\n\nThe most comprehensive study of the history of Nahuan languages is Una Canger's \"Five Studies inspired by Nahuatl verbs in -oa\" (Canger 1980), in which she explores the historical development of grammar of the verbs ending in \"-oa\" and \"-ia\". She shows that verbs in \"-oa\" and \"-ia\" are historically and grammatically distinct from verbs in \"-iya\" and \"-owa\", although they are not distinguished in pronunciation in any modern dialects. She shows the historical basis for the five verb classes, based on how they form the perfect tense-aspect, and she shows that all of the different forms of the perfect tense-aspect derives from a single \"-ki\" morpheme that has developed differently depending on the phonological shape of the verb to which it was suffixed. She also explains the historical development of the applicative suffix with the shape \"-lia\" and \"-lwia\" as coming from a single suffix of the shape \"-liwa\".\n\nIn 1984 Canger and Dakin published an article in which they showed that Proto-Nahuan \"*ɨ\" had become /e/ in some Nahuan dialects and /i/ in others, and they proposed that this split was among the oldest splits of the Nahuan group.\n\nDakin has proposed a historical internal classification of Nahuan, e.g., Dakin (2000). She asserts two groups of migrations in central Mexico and eventually southwards to Central America. The first produced Eastern dialects. Centuries later, the second group of migrations produced Western dialects. But many modern dialects are the result of blending between particular Eastern dialects and particular Western dialects.\n\nCampbell in his grammar of Pipil (1985) discussed the problem of classifying Pipil. Pipil is either a descendant of Nahuatl (in his estimation) or still to this day a variety of Nahuatl (in the estimation of for example Lastra de Suárez (1986) and Dakin (2001)).\n\nDakin (1982) is a book-length study (in Spanish) of the phonological evolution of Proto-Nahuatl. Dakin (1991) suggested that irregularities in the modern Nahuatl system of possessive prefixes might be due to the presence in Proto-Nahuan of distinct grammatical marking for two types of possession.\n\nIn the 1990s, two papers appeared addressing the old research problem of the \"saltillo\" in Nahuatl: a lost paper by Whorf (1993), and Manaster Ramer (1995).\n\nA Center-Periphery scheme was introduced by Canger in 1978, and supported by comparative historical data in 1980. Lastra de Suarez' (1986) dialect atlas that divided dialects into center and peripheral areas based on strictly synchronic evidence. The subsequent 1988 article by Canger adduced further historical evidence for this division.(Dakin 2003:261).\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, scholarship on Nahuan languages was limited almost entirely to the literary language that existed approximately 1540–1770 (which is now known as Classical Nahuatl, although the descriptor \"classical\" was never used until the 20th century). Since the 1930s, there have appeared several grammars of individual modern dialects (in either article or book form), in addition to articles of narrower scope.\n\nThe history of research into Nahuan dialect classification in the 20th century up to 1988 has been reviewed by Canger (1988). Before 1978, classification proposals had relied to a greater or lesser degree on the three way interdialectal sound correspondence /t͡ɬ ~ t ~ l/ (the lateral affricate /t͡ɬ/ of Classical Nahuatl and many other dialects corresponds to /t/ in some eastern and southern dialects and to /l/ in yet other dialects). Benjamin Lee Whorf (1937) had performed an analysis and concluded that /t͡ɬ/ was the \"reflex\" of Proto-Uto-Aztecan */t/ before /a/ (a conclusion which has been borne out). But in 1978 Campbell and Langacker made the novel proposal—which met with immediate universal acceptance—that this sound change had occurred back in Proto-Aztecan (the ancestor dialect of Pochutec and General Aztec) and that therefore the corresponding /t/ or /l/ in Nahuatl dialects were innovations.\n\nAs a geographical note: the northern part of the State of Puebla is universally recognized as having two subgroupings. The northern part of the State of Puebla is a long north to south lobe. In the middle of it from east-northeast to west-southwest runs the Sierra de Puebla (as Nahuanist linguists call it) or Sierra Norte de Puebla (as geographers call it). The \"Sierra de Puebla\" dialects are quite distinct from the \"northern Puebla\" dialects, which are spoken in northernmost Puebla State and very small parts of neighboring states.\n\nDakin (2003:261) gives the following classification of Nahuatl dialects (in which the word \"north\" has been replaced by \"northern\"), based on her earlier publications, e.g., Dakin (2000).\n\n\nMost specialists in Pipil (El Salvador) consider it to have diverged from Nahuatl to the point it should no longer be considered a variety of Nahuatl. Most specialists in Nahuan do not consider Pochutec to have ever been a variety of Nahuatl.\n\nCanger (1978; 1980) and Lastra de Suarez (1986) have made classification schemes based on data and methodology which each investigator has well documented. Canger proposed a single Central grouping and several Peripheral groupings. The Center grouping is hypothesized to have arisen during the Aztec Empire by diffusion of the defining feature (an innovative verb form) and other features from the prestigious dialect of the capital. The dialects which adopted it could be from multiple genetic divisions of General Aztec. As for the various Peripheral groupings, their identity as Peripheral is defined negatively, i.e., by their lack the grammatical feature which, it is proposed, defines the Central grouping. Canger recognized the possibility that centuries of population migrations and other grammatical feature diffusions may have combined to obscure the genetic relationships (the branching evolution) among the dialects of Nahuatl.\n\nSome of the isoglosses used by Canger to establish the Peripheral vs. Central dialectal dichotomy are these:\n\nLastra de Suárez in her Nahuatl dialect atlas (1986) affirmed the concept of the Center/Periphery geographic dichotomy, but amended Canger's assignment of some subgroupings to the Center or the Periphery. The three most important divergences are probably those involving Huastec dialects, Sierra de Zongolica dialects, and northwestern Guerrero dialects. Lastra classifies these as Peripheral, Central, and Central, respectively, while in each case Canger does the opposite.\n\nThe dialectal situation is very complex and most categorizations, including the one presented above, are, in the nature of things, controversial. Lastra wrote, \"The isoglosses rarely coincide. As a result, one can give greater or lesser importance to a feature and make the [dialectal] division that one judges appropriate/convenient\" (1986:189). And she warned: \"We insist that this classification is not [entirely] satisfactory\" (1986:190). Both researchers emphasized the need for more data in order for there to be advances in the field of Nahuatl dialectology. Since the 1970s, there has been an increase in research whose immediate aim is the production of grammars and dictionaries of individual dialects. But there is also a detailed study of dialect variation in the dialect subgroup sometimes known as the Zongolica (Andrés Hasler 1996). A. Hasler sums up the difficulty of classifying Zongolica thus (1996:164): \"Juan Hasler (1958:338) interprets the presence in the region of [a mix of] eastern dialect features and central dialect features as an indication of a substratum of eastern Nahuatl and a superstratum of central Nahuatl. Una Canger (1980:15–20) classifies the region as part of the eastern area, while Yolanda Lastra (1986:189–190) classifies it as part of the central area.\"\n\nAs already alluded to, the nucleus of the Central dialect territory is the Valley of Mexico. The extinct Classical Nahuatl, the enormously influential language spoken by the people of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, is one of the Central dialects. Lastra in her dialect atlas proposed three Peripheral groupings: eastern, western, and Huasteca. She included Pipil in Nahuatl, assigning it to the Eastern Periphery grouping. Lastra's classification of dialects of modern Nahuatl is as follows (many of the labels refer to Mexican states):\n\n\nThis list is taken from the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI)'s \"Catálogo de Lenguas Indígenas Nacionales\".

Narcissistic mortification is a term first used by Sigmund Freud in his last book, \"Moses and Monotheism\", with respect to early injuries to the ego/self. The concept has been widely employed in ego psychology and also contributed to the roots of self psychology.\n\nWhen narcissistic mortification is experienced for the first time, it may be defined as a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality, or both. This produces strong emotions of terror while at the same time narcissistic libido (also known as ego-libido) or destrudo is built up. Narcissistic libido or ego-libido is the concentration of libido on the self. Destrudo is the opposite of libido and is the impulse to destroy oneself and everything associated with oneself.\n\nEdmund Bergler developed the concept of narcissistic mortification in connection with early fantasies of omnipotence in the developing child, and with the fury provoked by the confrontations with reality that undermine his or her illusions. For Bergler, “the narcissistic mortification suffered in this very early period continues to act as a stimulus throughout his life”.\n\nAnna Freud used the term in connection with her exploration of the defence mechanism of altruistic surrender, whereby an individual lives only through the lives of others – seeing at the root of such an abrogation of one's own life an early experience of narcissistic mortification at a disappointment with one's self.\n\nPsychoanalyst and author Ludwig Eidelberg subsequently expanded on the concept in the fifties and sixties. Eidelberg defined narcissistic mortification as occurring when “a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality...produces the painful emotional experience of terror”. He also stressed that for many patients simply to have to accept themselves as having neurotic symptoms was itself a source of narcissistic mortification.\n\nFor Kohut, narcissistic injury - the root cause of what he termed narcissistic personality disorder – was broadly equivalent to the humiliation of mortification. Kohut considered that “if the grandiosity of the narcissistic self has been insufficiently modified...then the adult ego will tend to vacillate between an irrational overestimation of the self and feelings of inferiority and will react with narcissistic mortification to the thwarting of its ambitions”.\n\nUnlike ego psychologists, object relations theorists have traditionally used a rather different, post-Kleinian vocabulary to describe the early woundings of narcissistic mortification. Recently however such theorists have found analogies between Freud's emphasis on the sensitivity of the ego to narcissistic humiliation and mortification, and the views of Bion on 'nameless dread' or Winnicott's on the original agonies of the breakdown of childhood consciousness. At the same time ego psychologists have been increasingly prepared to see narcissistic mortification as occurring in the context of early relations to objects.\n\nAn individual’s experience of mortification may be accompanied by both physical and psychological sensations. Physical sensations such as: burning, painful tingling over the body, pain in the chest that slowly expands and spreads throughout the torso, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, blanching, coldness and numbness can be experienced by the individual suffering from mortification. The psychological sensations described are feeling shocked, exposed, and humiliated. Descriptions of this experience can be, for example: “It feels like I won’t survive” and “I have the absolute conviction that he or she hates me and it’s my fault”. These sensations are always followed by shock, although they may have happened on various occasions, they also prompt the need for the individual suffering to do something both internally and externally, to effect a positive self-image in the eyes of their narcissistic object. Narcissistic mortification is extreme in its intensity, global nature, and its lack of perspective, causing the anxiety associated with it to become traumatic.\n\nIn Eidelberg's view, a normal individual would usually be able to avoid being overwhelmed by internal needs because they recognize these urges in time to bring about their partial discharge. However, Eidelberg does not view occasional outbursts of temper as a sign of disorder. An individual experiencing pathological narcissistic mortification is prone to become fixated on infantile objects, resulting in an infantile form of discharge. He or she cannot be satisfied by the partial discharge of this energy, which takes place on an unconscious level, and this in turn interferes with their well-being. According to Eidelberg, the denial of an infantile narcissistic mortification can be responsible for many defensive mechanisms.\n\nNarcissistic mortification can be: \n\nTo escape the narcissistic mortification of accepting their own dependency needs, cult leaders may resort to delusions of omnipotence. Their continuing shame and underlying guilt, and their repudiation of dependency, obliges such leaders to use seduction and manic defenses to externalize and locate dependency needs in others, thus making their followers controllable through a displaced sense of shame.\n\nBecause in western culture death is sometimes seen as the ultimate loss of control, fear of it may produce death anxiety in the form of a sense of extreme shame or narcissistic mortification. The shame in this context is produced by the loss of stoicism, productivity, and control, aspects that are highly valued by society and aspects that are taken away as one ages. Death according to Darcy Harris, 'is the ultimate narcissistic wound, bringing about not just the annihilation of self, but the annihilation of one's entire existence, resulting in a form of existential shame for human beings, who possess the ability to ponder this dilemma with their higher functioning cognitive abilities.'\n\nIndividuals who hold this anxiety are ashamed of mortality and the frailty that comes along with it; and may attempt to overcome this reality through diversions and accomplishments, deflecting feelings of inferiority and shame through strategies like grandiosity in similar fashion to those with narcissistic personality traits.\n\nNarcissistic mortification may also be produced by death of someone close. Such a loss of an essential object may even lead through narcissistic mortification to suicide.\n\nAmong the many motives behind suicidal activities in general are shame, loss of honor, and narcissistic mortification. Those who suffer from narcissistic mortification are more likely to participate in suicidal behaviors and those who do not receive the proper help more often than not succeed. Suicide related to narcissistic mortification is different from normal sorrow in that it is associated with deep rooted self-contempt and self-hatred.\n\nAccording to a paper presented by Mary Libbey, \"On Narcissistic Mortification\", presented at the 2006 Shame Symposium, long-term goal of psychoanalytic treatment for those who suffer from narcissistic mortification is to transform the mortification into shame. She says by transforming it into shame it enables the sufferer to tolerate and use it as a signal; the process of transforming mortification into shame entails working through both the early mortifying traumas as well as the defenses, often unstable, related to them. If an individual sufferer does not go through this transformation, he or she is left with two unstable narcissistic defenses. Libbey says these defenses are: self-damning, deflated states designed to appease and hold on to self-objects, and narcissistic conceit, which is designed to project the defective self experiences onto self-objects. Both of these defensive styles require a continuation of dependence on the self-object. Transforming the mortification into shame makes it possible for self-appraisal and self-tolerance, this ultimately leads to psychic separation and self-reliance without the need to sustain one's mortification, according to Libbey's paper.\n\nPostmodern Freudians link narcissistic mortification to Winnicott's theory of primitive mental states which lack the capacity for symbolisation, and their need for re-integration. Returning in the transference to the intolerable mortification underpinning such narcissistic defences can however also produce positive analytic change, by way of the (albeit mortifying) re-experience of overwhelming object loss within an intersubjective holding environment.\n\n21st century American analysts are particularly concerned with the potential production of narcissistic mortification as a by-product of analytic interpretation, especially with regard to masochistic personality disorder.\n\nNarcissistic mortification at injuries to self-esteem has been seen as pervading Captain Ahab's motivations in his confrontation with Moby-Dick.\n\nMortification at one's self is seen in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein when the Creature stares at his reflection in a pool of water. This is where he becomes convinced that he is in fact the Creature and becomes filled with despondence and mortification.\n"}

It permitted the King to legislate by decree, ordering that \"traditional\" proclamations (that is, any unable to impose the death penalty or forfeiture of goods) should be obeyed as \"though they were made by act of parliament\". In addition the act appointed machinery for their enforcement.\n\nSir William Blackstone called the Act \"a statute, which was calculated to introduce the most despotic tyranny; and which must have proved fatal to the liberties of this kingdom, had it not been luckily repealed.\"\n\nThe Act was once considered to be the height of Henry VIII's despotism. The great efforts made by the King's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, when drafting the acts of this time show that he was aware of the importance of statute and Parliament.\n\nCromwell's natural reaction to any problem of government was to draft a bill. However, there were times when an immediate decision or temporary policy was required without having to wait for Parliament. For example, in 1535 it was desired to prevent the export of currency from the realm; Cromwell insisted on finding a relevant statute, although he was relieved to hear from the judges that, in such matters, failing such a statute, the king had the power to issue a proclamation. Nevertheless, Cromwell felt unsatisfied, and hence the Act of 1539, designed to give general legal sanction to royal proclamations.\n\nCromwell originally intended to allow the common-law courts to enforce these proclamations. However, opposition from the House of Lords forced him instead to accept a council as nominated in the act. This council proved so incapable of doing the work that in 1547, when the Act was repealed, it made no difference to the legality of royal proclamations.\n\nProclamations would continue to prove controversial, especially when it came to taxation in which it was seen as an arbitrary power, becoming one of the many reasons for the War of the Three Kingdoms. Restored Stuart attempts at emulating French absolutism through revival of proclamations would be a factor in causing the eventual Glorious Revolution, leading to the Bill of Rights that entrenched Parliamentary sovereignty.\n\n\n"}

In this regard, semantics focuses on the organization of and action upon information by acting as an intermediary between heterogeneous data sources, which may conflict not only by structure but also context or value.\n\nIn enterprise application integration (EAI), semantic integration can facilitate or even automate the communication between computer systems using metadata publishing. Metadata publishing potentially offers the ability to automatically link ontologies. One approach to (semi-)automated ontology mapping requires the definition of a semantic distance or its inverse, semantic similarity and appropriate rules. Other approaches include so-called \"lexical methods\", as well as methodologies that rely on exploiting the structures of the ontologies. For explicitly stating similarity/equality, there exist special properties or relationships in most ontology languages. OWL, for example has \"owl:equivalentClass\", \"owl:equivalentProperty\" and \"owl:sameAs\".\n\nEventually system designs may see the advent of composable architectures where published semantic-based interfaces are joined together to enable new and meaningful capabilities. These could predominately be described by means of design-time declarative specifications, that could ultimately be rendered and executed at run-time.\n\nSemantic integration can also be used to facilitate design-time activities of interface design and mapping. In this model, semantics are only explicitly applied to design and the run-time systems work at the syntax level. This \"early semantic binding\" approach can improve overall system performance while retaining the benefits of semantic driven design.\n\nThe Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing has been a venue for the popularization of the ontology mapping task in the biomedical domain, and a number of papers on the subject can be found in its proceedings.\n\n\n"}

For example, radio and television broadcasters may program a news program at rush hours every day, or at least every weekday.\n\nStrip programming is used to deliver consistent content to targeted audiences. Broadcasters know or predict the times at which certain demographics will be listening to or watching their programs and play them at that time. Most television dayparts outside of prime time use strip programming five days a week, with the same programs being broadcast every day at the same time to target specific demographics. Strip programming is sometimes criticized as making programming too predictable, and reducing diversity and uniqueness.\n\nStrip scheduling often applies to any program that airs on multiple consecutive days during the calendar week (most commonly Monday through Friday), whether carried through a television network (such as with a talk show, news program or soap opera) or in syndication. It is commonly restricted to describing the airing of television programs that were originally broadcast on a weekly basis during their original run: \"The West Wing\" could be stripped but not \"Jeopardy!\", as \"Jeopardy!\" was originally intended to be run daily. It can also refer to shows in prime time that run daily, such as with the short-lived \"The Jay Leno Show\" in 2009 and 2010.\n\nFor much of the 1960s and into the early 1990s, stripping for syndication was one of, if not \"the\" primary profit component of the studio production model in American television. A show became far more profitable if it succeeded in getting three full U.S. seasons (about 75 episodes) or more, as then it was possible to strip it for fifteen weeks (15×5=75) before needing to repeat episodes. Once a series attained five seasons (which would push the show over the 100 episodes threshold), it would be a full six months before it would repeat. For \"\", in particular, this was relevant. Only due to an unprecedented letter-writing campaign was the show renewed for its third season, and it did not begin to attain wider popularity until appearing in syndication for a number of years. If it had failed to be renewed for a third season, it would not have been syndicated, and its subsequent popularity and influence would likely not have occurred. Many other shows with lukewarm response in their initial runs became widely appreciated cult favorites as a result of syndication, or helped keep cultural memes associated with them far more widely known than if the shows had only been viewable during their initial time frame.\n\nMichael Grade was responsible for introducing stripped and stranded schedules to the BBC's television service in the United Kingdom in his role as controller of BBC1: from February 18, 1985, onward, the weekday evening schedule has consisted almost entirely of half-hour or hour-long programs starting on the hour, or half-hour (the BBC channels never carried spot advertising). For example, Grade's new schedule provided at 19:00, the talk show \"Wogan\" thrice weekly and two episodes of \"EastEnders\" and fixed the national news at 18:00 and 21:00, and regional news at 18:30. Before this date, programs might start at almost any time and programs could have different times on consecutive weeks or even days, for example:\nCompare with a 2007 schedule for the same channel:\nStripping has also become an even more common practice on many British channels since the introduction of multi-channel cable and satellite television in the 1990s.\n\nIn many other countries, even new episodes of various series are aired every weekday. For example, if such a station gets the most recent season of a television series originating from the United States, the episodes will air in this way for two or three weeks, after which they are replaced by another show in the same timeslot.\n\nIn Australia, Network Ten and its sister station Eleven have stripped \"The Simpsons\" for many years, airing the show daily at 6:00 p.m., which is traditionally the news hour on rivals Seven Network and Nine Network. Despite some attempts to fill this slot with original programming, \"The Simpsons\" stripped at 6:00 p.m. remained a mainstay of Australian television until recently.\n"}
{"id": "625161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625161", "title": "Sudden death (sport)", "text": "Sudden death (sport)\n\nIn a sport or game, sudden death (also sudden-death overtime or a sudden-death round) is a form of competition where play ends as soon as one competitor is ahead of the others, with that competitor becoming the winner. Sudden death is typically used as a tiebreaker when a contest is tied at the end of the normal playing time or the completion of the normal playing task.\n\nAn alternative tiebreaker method is to play a reduced version of the original; for example, in association football 30 minutes of extra time (overtime) after 90 minutes of normal time, or in golf one playoff round (18 holes) after four standard rounds (72 holes). Sudden-death playoffs typically end more quickly than these reduced replays. Reducing the variability of the event's duration assists those scheduling television time and team travel. Fans may see sudden death as exciting and suspenseful, or they may view the format as insufficiently related to the sport played during regulation time; for example, prior to 2012, the National Football League (American football) used a sudden-death rule for overtime play. In those situations, a team possessing the ball need only kick a field goal to end the game in their favor, negating the additional benefit that typically comes with scoring a touchdown.\n\nSudden death provides a victor for the contest without a specific amount of time being required. It may be called \"next score wins\" or similar, although in some games, the winner may result from penalization of the other competitor for a mistake. Sudden death may instead be called sudden victory to avoid the mention of death and serious disease, particularly in sports with a high risk of physical injury. This variant became one of announcer Curt Gowdy's idiosyncrasies in 1971 when the AFC divisional championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins went into overtime.\n\nNorth American professional sports using a sudden-death method of settling a tied game include the modified version now employed by the National Football League, the National Hockey League and, also in a modified sense, the PGA Tour (golf). Baseball uses a unique method of tie-breaking that incorporates elements of sudden death. In some goal-scoring games sudden-death extra time may be given in which the first goal scored wins; in association football it is called the \"golden goal\", although this has not been recognised since it was abolished from the Laws of the Game in 2004 by FIFA. In baseball, a winning run scored by the home team in an extra inning is often referred to as a walk-off, as the players can immediately walk off the field.\n\nSudden death has been perceived as a particularly poor fit for gridiron football because the process gives an inherent advantage to the team who starts with possession of the ball: they can score and end the game immediately (even by driving a relatively short distance into field goal range and then kicking a field goal), but the team on defense cannot (other than through far rarer scoring strategies such as the pick-six or the safety).\n\nAll organized forms of American football have abolished pure sudden death for overtime as of the 2011 season. Most levels of the game, including high school football and college football, never used it, instead either allowing ties to stand or using alternatives like the Kansas Playoff. The National Football League was an exception; the league used pure sudden death in its playoffs beginning in 1940 and in regular season matchups starting in 1974, finally modifying its process for playoffs in 2010 and then regular season games in 2011.\n\nOriginally, all National Football League games tied at the end of regulation time ended as a tie. Late in the 1940 season, NFL President Carl Storck announced that sudden death periods would be authorized for any playoff game needed to decide either division title. It was emphasized that this did not apply to the final championship game, which would crown co-champions in the event of a tie. Commissioner Elmer Layden approved a similar arrangement for the 1941 season, with the same limitation. In the years when it was within the rules, the NFL Championship Game only was tied in regulation in the 1958 NFL Championship Game. A tied game in regulation did not occur in the Super Bowl until Super Bowl LI (51).\n\nSudden death overtime was finally approved for the NFL championship game in 1946 and remains in effect now. The first playoff game requiring overtime was the 1958 NFL Championship Game.\n\nIn 1974, the NFL adopted a 15-minute sudden-death overtime period for regular-season games; in it was cut to 10 minutes. The game ended as a tie if neither team scores in overtime. When a team gets near the end zone, it typically tried to kick a field goal. An overtime game can also be won by scoring a touchdown (in such an event, the extra point is not attempted). This usually happened on a play that began with field position far enough away from the end zone to make a field goal difficult if not impossible, but it can also result from a team choosing not to attempt a field goal until reaching fourth down, even if the team enters an easy field goal range; this strategy only works if the team can maintain possession of the ball and does not fumble the ball away, throw an interception or lose enough yardage to back out of field goal range. Only thrice has an overtime game been won by a safety. In recent years, sportscasters have referred to such scoring plays as \"walk-offs,\" as both teams can walk off the field after the play.\n\nSince the 2010–11 playoffs, in the post-season, each team was allowed at least one possession to score in overtime, unless the team receiving the kickoff scored a touchdown or if the defensive team scored a touchdown or safety on the same possession. True sudden death rules applied if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. This rule did not actually come into use during the 2010 playoffs, with the first overtime game under the new rules not occurring until 2011, with the Denver Broncos scoring a long touchdown on their first play from scrimmage against the Pittsburgh Steelers. \n\nThis rule was adopted for the start of the 2012 regular season. It was adopted to counter the criticism that the outcome of overtime games was very frequently decided by the coin toss, as the team which won it usually attempted only enough offensive action to maneuver into field goal range and seldom made a real effort to score a touchdown. In the regular season, games still tied after one full overtime period will continue to be allowed to end in a tie.\n\nFor information on games that have taken a long time under sudden death, see Overtime.\n\nIn arena football, each team is allowed one overtime possession in the first overtime, after which whoever is ahead is the winner. If the score is still tied, however, true sudden death rules apply thereafter. (A similar, modified sudden death format, with a 10-minute limit, was used in the NFL Europa League.) This rule was implemented in the 2007 season; prior to this, the league used extra time, a fixed seven and one-half minute extra period; if the game was still tied at this point, it was recorded as a tied game. This was later changed to a fifteen-minute maximum modified sudden death as above, but with a definite conclusion after one overtime period, again a tied game being recorded if the score was still equal. (Only one tied game was recorded under each of the two prior overtime rules.) Since the beginning of the 2007 season, all Arena football games, both regular season and playoff, have been played to a victorious conclusion. Any succeeding overtime periods are true sudden death periods. An exception is applied to second game of the 2018 semifinal series, provided one team wins the first game and the second game ends with the two-game aggregate score tied, the game will continue with a standard overtime even if the score of the second game is not tied.\n\nSudden death has a controversial history in association football. Important matches were traditionally resolved by replaying the entire match, however in the era of television and tight travel schedules this is often impracticable. Replays are still used in some major competitions (like the FA Cup).\n\nIn many matches, if the score is tied after the full 90 minutes, a draw results; however, if one team must be eliminated, some form of tie-breaking must occur. Originally, two 15-minute halves of extra time were held and if the teams remained equal at the end of the halves, kicks from the penalty mark are held.\n\nTo try to decrease the chances of requiring kicks from the penalty mark, the IFAB, the world law making body of the sport, experimented with new rules. The golden goal rule transformed the overtime periods into sudden death until the periods were over, where shootouts would occur. As this became unpopular, the silver goal rule was instituted, causing the game to end if the scores were not equal after the first 15-minute period as well as the second. The silver goal has also fallen into disrepute so UEFA Euro 2004 was the last event to use it; after which the original tie-breaking methods were restored.\n\nThe main criticism of golden goal is the quickness of ending the game, and the pressure on coaches and players. Once a goal is scored, the game is over and the opponent cannot attempt to answer the goal within the remaining time. Therefore, teams would place more emphasis on not conceding a goal rather than scoring a goal, and many golden goal extra time periods remained scoreless.\n\nIn NCAA collegiate play in the United States, however, sudden death, adopted in 1997 for all championship play in addition to regular season play, remains. In 2005, the Division II Women's Championship game ended in sudden death as a goal was scored three minutes into the overtime to end the championship match. Sudden death is also prevalent in youth play, for the safety of players.\n\nIf the teams are still tied after the initial allocated number in the penalty shoot-out, the game goes to sudden-death penalties, where each team takes a further one penalty each, repeated until only one team scores, resulting in the winning of the game.\n\nIn badminton, if a set is tied at 29-all, golden point is played; whoever scores this point wins it.\n\nBaseball and softball are not true sudden-death sports, but they have one comparable situation.\n\nBaseball and softball games cannot end until both teams have had an equal number of turns at bat, unless further play (by the home team if they lead after innings) cannot affect the outcome. In the final scheduled inning (typically, in professional and advanced amateur leagues the ninth inning, but usually the seventh for youth leagues and softball, and the sixth for leagues for subteens such as Little League), if the visitors complete their turn at bat and still trail the hosts, the game ends. If the visitors lead or the game is tied, the hosts take their \"last ups\" at bat. If the hosts should exceed the visitors' score, the game ends at the conclusion of the play on which the hosts take this insurmountable lead. (If the final scheduled inning ends in a tie, multiple extra innings are played with the same implications as the final scheduled inning.)\n\nThe ability to bat last is an advantage of being the home team. It is said that \"visitors must play to win; hosts need only play to tie\" because tying forces an extra inning.\n\nA tied game in the bottom of the final scheduled inning puts pressure on the visitors. For example, with a runner on third base and fewer than two outs, the visitors cannot afford even to get certain types of out that would let the game-ending run score after the out.\n\nA scoring play that ends the game is called a walk-off, because after the runner scores the winning run everyone can walk off the field. A walk-off home run is an exception to the rule stated above; the game does not end when the winning run scores, but continues until the batter and all runners score (provided they run the bases correctly).\n\nBasketball does not traditionally employ sudden death to decide games; it instead uses multiple five-minute overtime periods to determine the result of games tied after regulation play. The entire overtime is played; if the game remains tied, this procedure is repeated.\n\nThe NBA Summer League, a developmental summer league, employs sudden death basketball after the first overtime. The rules state \"Double overtime & thereafter is sudden death (first team to score a point wins).\" In the first sudden death professional basketball game, Devin Ebanks hit a game winner with 45 seconds elapsed for the D-League Select team, beating the summer league Atlanta Hawks.\n\nAnother form of basketball does employ a sudden-death overtime. 3x3, a formalized version of the half-court three-on-three game, uses an untimed overtime period that ends by rule once either team has scored 2 points. In this form of the sport, shots taken from behind the \"three-point\" arc are worth 2 points and all other shots are worth 1 point.\n\nAn individual fencing bout lasts for five touches in a poule match, or 15 touches in a direct elimination (DE) match in all three weapons (épée, foil, and sabre. Although sabre bouts rarely go to full-time, the same time frames apply) Matches are also timed (three minutes for a poule match, and three periods of three minutes for a DE). If neither fencer has reached five or 15 points within the time limit, the leading fencer is deemed the winner. However, if the fencers are tied after the allotted time, one minute of extra time is added.\n\nBefore resuming the bout, one fencer is randomly awarded \"priority\". The first fencer to score a valid hit within extra time wins the match; if no valid hits are scored within the time, that fencer with priority is declared the victor.\n\nIn the normal course of a match, there is a de facto sudden death situation if both fencers are tied at four (or 14) touches each. The final hit is called \"la belle\". The fencers may salute each other before playing for the final point.\n\nIn individual match play, players level after the regulation 18 or 36 holes will play extra holes in sudden death. In team tournaments, players may gain half a point each for a tie rather than play sudden death; this is the case in the Ryder Cup, for example. In the Presidents Cup, there was provision for a single-player sudden death shootout if the entire competition ended in a tie. When this came to pass in 2003, the tiebreak was unfinished at dusk. There was no provision for an extra day's play, and both team captains agreed to declare the match tied and share the trophy.\n\nTraditionally, professional stroke play golf tournaments ending in a tie were played off the next day with an eighteen-hole match. Modern considerations such as television coverage and the tight travel schedule of most leading golfers have led to this practice being almost entirely abandoned, and in all but the most important tournaments, the champion is determined by sudden death. All players tied after the completion of regulation play are taken to a predetermined hole, and then play it and others in order as needed. If at least two players are tied, player(s) who score higher on a hole than the other competitors is/are immediately eliminated, and those still tied continue play until one remaining player has a lower score for a hole than any of the others remaining, who is declared the winner.\n\nOf the four men's major championships, only The Masters uses a sudden-death playoff format, first used in 1979. Through 2017 (and last used in 2008), the had an 18-hole playoff at stroke play on the day after the main tournament, with sudden-death if needed after 18 holes. A two-hole aggregate playoff is used since 2018, followed by sudden-death if needed. First used in 1989, The Open Championship uses a four-hole total-stroke playoff, while the PGA Championship uses a three-hole total-stroke playoff, first used in 2000. The PGA Championship introduced the sudden-death playoff to the majors in 1977 and used it seven times through 1996. Sudden death is used if a tie exists at the end of the scheduled playoff.\n\nSudden-death overtime has traditionally been used in playoff and championship games in hockey. It has been used in the National Hockey League throughout the league's history. The first NHL game with sudden-death overtime was game four of the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals. Currently, the NHL, American Hockey League, and ECHL also use the sudden-death system in their regular seasons, playing a five-minute overtime period when the score is tied at the end of regulation time.\n\nIn 2000, the AHL reduced the teams to four players each during the five-minute overtime. (But any two-man advantage is administered with five-on-three play rather than four-on-two.) The ECHL and NHL both changed to the four-on-four overtime format in 2001, with the International Olympic Committee following by no later than 2010. By 2015 the NHL went to the three-on-three format. In the SPHL, a class A minor league, the overtime is three-on-three, with the team that would be on the power play given a fourth, and a fifth attacker respectively instead, and any penalty in the final two minutes results in a penalty shot instead of a power play.\n\nIf neither team scores during this period, the teams use a penalty-shot shootout, consisting of three players in the NHL or five players in the minor leagues, to determine the winner. In the NHL, if no team wins this shootout, a 1-by-1, sudden-death shootout ensues. No player may shoot twice until every non-goaltender on the bench has taken a shot.\n\nDuring championship playoffs, however, all games are played to a conclusion resulting in a victory for one team and a loss for the other. These are true sudden-death games, which have gone on into as many as six additional full 20-minute periods with five players, instead of the five-minute period with at least three players.\n\nIIHF hockey uses a penalty-shot shootout for gold medal games if neither team scores after one 20-minute, sudden-death overtime period. The shootout is decided in best-of-5 rounds, then round by round (in other words, if one team scores in the 6th round or beyond and the other fails, the game ends, unlike most professional leagues), and players can shoot as many times as the team desires (first 5 rounds are done in order, then reversely thereafter; may use new or same players). (There is a 5-minute overtime in round-robin games [10 minutes in elimination/bronze medal games], plus the best-of-5-round [best-of-3 rounds in round robin] shootout procedure in elimination/bronze medal games.)\n\nIn the case of a tie in competition judo, the match proceeds to Golden Score, another form of Sudden Death. Sudden Death in competition Judo consists of a 5 minute long match, during which the first competitor to achieve a score is awarded the match. Penalties in Judo award points to the other competitor, making fair-play of absolute importance. If no victor is decided in Golden Score, the match is decided based on a Referee's Decision. A Referee's Decision is a vote amongst the Referee and both Judges of the match.\n\nIn mixed martial arts competitions that consist of an even number of rounds, a type of sudden death is sometimes used in the event that each competitor wins an equal number of points. This is not a true sudden death that ends on the first point scored, since MMA competitions do not generally score individual points. Rather, it is a final round of combat, the winner of which is declared the winner of the match. This particular rule, known as \"Sudden Victory\", has been commonly seen in previous seasons of the reality television show \"The Ultimate Fighter\" when the competition has consisted of two rounds. A sudden victory round rule was also implemented in the tournament to decide Ultimate Fighting Championship's first Flyweight Champion.\n\nSudden death in wrestling is most commonly seen in Real Canadian Wrestling tournament matches, in which a victor must be decided. This happens in the case of a double knockout or double countout. In the United States, Sudden Death rules occurs mainly in an Iron Man match when there is a tie after the time limit have expired. (Most notably at Wrestlemania XII when the match between Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart ended 0-0 after the 60 minute limit)\n\nAn example that invoked sudden death occurred in the 2005 Royal Rumble. John Cena and Batista were left, and both men's feet touched the ground at the same time. A comparable draw leading to sudden death might happen if the shoulders of a wrestler applying a submission move are on the mat.\n\nDrawn National Rugby League premiership and State of Origin series games are subject to sudden death extra time after 80 minutes of play, called the golden point. Golden point consists of two five-minute halves, with the teams swapping ends at the end of the first half.\n\nAny score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in golden point wins the game for the scoring team - no conversion is attempted if a try is the winning score.\n\nIn the NRL, the victor in golden point receives two competition points, the loser none. In the event that no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn, and each team receives one point each.\n\nIn the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the Rugby World Cup, a match drawn after 80 minutes does not proceed immediately to sudden death conditions. Two 10-minute extra time periods are played first, if scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for a single sudden-death period of 10 minutes to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner.\n\nHowever, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.\n\nIn contrast with the usual sudden-death procedure of awarding the victory to the next side to score, tennis and volleyball require that the margin of victory be two. A volleyball game tied at the target score continues until one team's score exceeds the other's by two points.\n\nThe traditional requirement that a tennis set be won by two games sometimes resulted in men's five-set matches lasting over six hours (including an 8-hour 11-minute set at Wimbledon) or, in women's/doubles' three-set matches, lasting over three hours, which is a major disruption to a television schedule. To shorten matches, sets tied at six games each can now be broken by a single tiebreaker game. This is awarded to the first player to score seven points. The winner must lead the loser by two points, so tiebreaker games can become lengthy in their own right.\n\nTiebreakers are not used in major tournaments in the final set, except at the US Open & the Olympics.\n\n\n"}

Given a subset formula_1 of a free monoid formula_2, one may define sets that consist of formal left or right inverses of elements in formula_1. These are called quotients, and one may define right or left quotients, depending on which side one is concatenating. Thus, the right quotient of formula_1 by an element formula_5 from formula_2 is the set\n\nSimilarly, the left quotient is\n\nThe syntactic quotient induces an equivalence relation on \"M\", called the syntactic relation, or syntactic equivalence (induced by \"S\"). The right syntactic equivalence is the equivalence relation\n\nSimilarly, the left syntactic relation is\n\nThe syntactic congruence or Myhill congruence may be defined as\n\nThe definition extends to a congruence defined by a subset \"S\" of a general monoid \"M\". A disjunctive set is a subset \"S\" such that the syntactic congruence defined by \"S\" is the equality relation.\n\nLet us call formula_12 the equivalence class of formula_13 for the syntactic congruence.\nThe syntactic congruence is compatible with concatenation in the monoid, in that one has\n\nfor all formula_15. Thus, the syntactic quotient is a monoid morphism, and induces a quotient monoid\n\nThis monoid formula_17 is called the syntactic monoid of \"S\".\nIt can be shown that it is the smallest monoid that recognizes \"S\"; that is, \"M\"(\"S\") recognizes \"S\", and for every monoid \"N\" recognizing \"S\", \"M\"(\"S\") is a quotient of a submonoid of \"N\". The syntactic monoid of \"S\" is also the transition monoid of the minimal automaton of \"S\".\n\nSimilarly, a language \"L\" is regular if and only if the family of quotients\n\nis finite. The proof showing equivalence is quite easy. Assume that a string \"x\" is read by a deterministic finite automaton, with the machine proceeding into state \"p\". If \"y\" is another string read by the machine, also terminating in the same state \"p\", then clearly one has formula_19. Thus, the number of elements in formula_20 is at most equal to the number of states of the automaton and formula_21 is at most the number of final states. Assume, conversely, that the number of elements in formula_20 is finite. One can then construct an automaton where formula_23 is the set of states, formula_24 is the set of final states, the language \"L\" is the initial state, and the transition function is given by formula_25. Clearly, this automaton recognizes \"L\". Thus, a language \"L\" is recognizable if and only if the set formula_20 is finite. Note that this proof also builds the minimal automaton.\n\nGiven a regular expression \"E\" representing \"S\", it is easy to compute the syntactic monoid of \"S\".\n\nA group language is one for which the syntactic monoid is a group.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48917358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48917358", "title": "Theory of narrative thought", "text": "Theory of narrative thought\n\nThe Theory of Narrative Thought is a theory of thought designed to bridge the gap between the neurological functioning of the brain and the flow of everyday conscious experience. Proposed by Lee Roy Beach, the theory is expanded by Beach, Byron Bissell, and James Wise (2016).\n\n The theory of narrative thought (TNT) is a refinement of image theory which was developed as an alternative to rational choice theory. The essence of image theory is that decisions are shaped by long-term attempts to manage the future rather than short-term results. The image theory model of the decision process, called the compatibility test, held up in both laboratory and field tests (Beach, L. R., & Connolly, T. (2005). The Psychology of Decision Making: People in Organizations. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) and has been retained, but renamed, as the discrepancy test in TNT.\n\nThe theory of narrative thought (TNT) describes the brain as being composed of subsystems that act together to give rise to consciousness. Some of these subsystems, such as perception and memory, contribute content to consciousness. One subsystem in the left hemisphere codes the content in language while a corresponding subsystem in the right hemisphere links it with emotions. Working together as a single system, called the “interpreter,” they organize the content of consciousness. This order is the origin of narrative but at this point it is rudimentary, a proto-narrative. The proto-narrative is simple but up-to-date; it reflects what is happening at the moment. For infants, proto-narratives are pretty much the whole story, but as memories are formed, past proto-narratives become linked with present proto-narratives and, as caregivers lend a hand, more elaborate narratives take shape. As a store of elaborated narratives develops, proto-narratives continue to update them with current information from the perceptual system. This keeps the narratives aware of what is going on in the internal and external environments. Over time, two kinds of narratives develop.\n\nChronicle narratives are about what happened in the past, what is happening now, and what is expected to happen in the future. They are the ongoing story of one’s conscious experience. Procedural narratives are about how to do things. They are about the actions one can take to better inform one’s chronicle narratives. They also are about the actions one can take to shape the future by acting directly upon the internal or external environment to produce desired results. Procedural narratives are subordinate to chronicle narratives. When used alone, the word “narrative” refers to chronicle narratives. [Note that chronicle and procedural narratives are parallel to, but not identical to, Daniel Kahneman’s (2011) System 1 and System 2.]\n\nNarratives are more than just updated memories about what has happened recently. They are the stuff of ongoing conscious experience, of moment-to-moment thinking, of the richness of mental life, and they are the foundations for informed guesses about the future. They are a mixture of memories and of visual, auditory, and other imagery as well as the accompanying emotions. Their elements are symbols that stand for real or imagined events and actors (including oneself), where the actors are animate beings or inanimate forces. The events and actors are linked by causality. Causality implies temporality and, for animate actors, purpose. That is, a narrative consists of a temporal arrangement of events that are purposefully caused by animate beings (including oneself) or are the result of inanimate forces. The narrative’s storyline is its meaning, which is created by a coherent arrangement of the events and actors.\n\nCausality is the structural backbone of all narratives, both chronicle and procedural. This is because it is the source of narrative temporality. This temporal aspect of causality works retrospectively, from effect to cause, which allows one to account for what is happening now as a result of what has happened in the past. And it works prospectively, from cause to effect, which allows one to set expectations for what will happen in the future as a result of what is happening now and what came before. A good narrative is plausible if its actors’ actions contribute to the story line and are not uncharacteristic, i.e., are reasonably consistent across narratives. A good narrative is coherent if the actions of the actors and the effects of those actions conform to one’s causal rules. In short, a good narrative makes sense in that there are no loose ends.\n\nNoncontingent rules are about what to expect to happen as a result of actions by other people or outside forces over which one has no control. Contingent rules are about what one expects to happen as a result of one’s own actions. These rules form the causal linkages among narratives’ elements and are the bases of expected and action projections respectively.\n\nCausal rules tell one what caused something to happen or how to make something happen. Another kind of rule, normative rules, tell one why something should happen. Normative rules are about what qualifies as desirable and what does not. That is, normative rules are standards for what is ethical, right, proper, principled, reasonable, appropriate, preferred, and so on, all of which are one’s values and preferences.\n\nThe current narrative is the narrative one is focused upon at the moment. It is the narrative that makes sense of what has happened leading up to the present, what is happening right now, and what will happen next. The latter, results from extrapolating the past and present segments of current narrative to make educated guesses about the future. A guess about how the future might unfold if one does not make an effort to change it is called an expected projection and a guess about how the future might unfold as a result of one’s efforts to change it is called an action projection. Both projections are narratives. Both are extrapolations of the current narrative. Both are constructed using one’s store of causal rules. Both are subject to the scrutiny of normative rules. Both are imaginary.\n\nWhen the future is projected, based upon the current narrative, the emotions associated with the relevant normative rules provide the criteria for evaluating the desirability of that future. Each feature of the projected future elicits an emotion that reflects how well it meets the relevant standard(s) set by one’s normative rule(s). A positive emotion is elicited if it meets the standard(s) and a negative emotion is elicited if it doesn’t. The strength of the elicited emotion is a function of the degree to which the feature exceeds or falls short of the standard(s). When evaluating the desirability of the projected future, the focus is on the features that fall short of one’s standards—called violations. If the violations are too abundant, too large, or too important, the associated negative emotions mount to a point at which one must conclude that the projected future will be undesirable. When this happens, survival, or simply unacceptable discomfort, dictates that something must be done to change the future so that when it arrives it will be more desirable than if things are simply allowed to happen as they will. The action agenda for changing the future is called a plan and execution of that plan is called implementation. The anticipated result of implementing the plan is the action projection. An acceptable plan is one that offers a sufficiently desirable future, a future that is compatible with one’s values and preferences.\n\nA plan is a narrative about how one intends to go from the present to a more desirable future—how one intends to influence the course of ongoing events in a desirable direction. Like other narratives, plans must be plausible and coherent. Plausibility means that all the relevant elements, including oneself, are included and that their proposed actions are reasonable. Coherence means that the sequence of tactics creates a feasible causal chain from the present to the desired future. Plausibility is revealed by the ease with which one can imagine oneself and other actors engaging in a successful implementation of the plan, even if it will require hard work. Plausibility also requires that this activity seems natural and lifelike, and that success doesn’t rely on unlikely events or unrealistic amounts effort and resources. Coherence is revealed by the completeness of the causal chain of tactics, even though one knows one probably won’t end up doing things exactly as planned. A plan that lacks plausibility and/or coherence inspires little confidence (which is an emotion associated with a normative standard), which prompts its revision or replacement by another plan.\n\nBriefly stated: (1) There are two kinds of narratives: chronicle narratives, which are stories about ongoing events, including the expected future, and procedural narratives, which are stories about how to do things; (2) both kinds of narrative are structured by time and causality and both are “good narratives” if they are plausible and coherent; (3) the undesirability of the expected future is assessed by its failure to meet standards set by one’s values and preferences; (4) action is prompted when the projected future is determined to be so undesirable as to be unacceptable.\n\nBoth Beach (2010) and Beach, Bissell, and Wise (2016) open with a historical description of the ebbing fortunes of “executive mind,” as a scientific concept but how, over the past 50 years, it has come back, albeit on firmer ground, as “the brain.” But while “the brain” may be the new name for “mind,” the fact that the old name continues to be used in both scientific and everyday discourse suggests that the new name doesn’t quite do the job. That is, rather than merely reflecting sloppy usage, the word “mind” reflects something more than merely neural activity in the brain.\n\nOther than the computer analogy and the information processing metaphor, cognitive science has produce no encompassing theory. But it seems to be widely assumed that when such a theory appears, it will necessarily be in terms of brain function to which conscious experience is subsidiary and derivative. TNT challenges this assumption by recognizing that brain functioning and conscious experience are two qualitatively different things. Although subjective experience derives from brain activity, it is not reducible to it. Therefore, the theory recognizes the importance of the brain and how it works, but it also recognizes the importance of conscious experience and how it works. Putting the two together as equally legitimate and complementary provides the “something more” than neural activity in the brain that is implied by the word “mind.”\nMuch has been written about the characteristics of mind, mostly by philosophers. The commonalities across those discussions reveals three primary characteristics that a theory of mind should address and that are, in fact, addressed by TNT: Thinking that is both reflective and reflexive—that is able to consider both itself and things other than itself. Knowing that allows distinctions between truth and falsity, error and ignorance, and belief and opinion. Purpose that results in actions aimed at foreseen objectives. In addition, TNT addresses the most common questions raised in these philosophical discussions: How does the mind operate? What are its “intrinsic excellences or defects?” How is it related to matter, to bodily organs, to material conditions, and to other minds? Is it possessed in common with animals? Does it exist separate from corporeality? Insofar as the theory adequately deals with these characteristics and answers these questions, it qualifies as a modern theory of mind.\n\n"}

The phrase can also be used as a noun to refer to the materials used in the process.\n\nSeveral methods can be used to shore up a trench. Hydraulic shoring is the use of hydraulic pistons that can be pumped outward until they press up against the trench walls. They are typically combined with steel plate or a special heavy plywood called Finform. Another method is called beam and plate, in which steel I-beams are driven into the ground and steel plates are slid in amongst them. A similar method that uses wood planks is called soldier boarding. Hydraulics tend to be faster and easier; the other methods tend to be used for longer term applications or larger excavations.\n\nShoring should not be confused with shielding by means of trench shields. Shoring is designed to prevent collapse, whilst shielding is only designed to protect workers should collapse occur. Most professionals agree that shoring is the safer approach of the two.\n\n"}

The description that follows is of a modern Standard Yiddish that was devised during the early 20th century and is frequently encountered in pedagogical contexts.\n\n\nAs in the Slavic languages with which Yiddish was long in contact (Russian, Belarusian, Polish, and Ukrainian), but unlike German, voiceless stops have little to no aspiration; unlike many such languages, voiced stops are not devoiced in final position. Moreover, Yiddish has regressive voicing assimilation, so that, for example, ('says') is pronounced and ('foreword') is pronounced .\n\nThe vowel phonemes of Standard Yiddish are:\n\n\n\nIn addition, the sonorants and can function as syllable nuclei:\n\nThe syllabic sonorants are always unstressed.\n\nIn vocabulary of Germanic origin, the differences between Standard German and Standard Yiddish pronunciation are mainly in the vowels and diphthongs. Examples are the German long as in \"Vater\" ('father'), which corresponds to in Yiddish , and the German long and long , which correspond to diphthongs in Yiddish ( and ). As in many Germanic languages, Yiddish lacks the German front rounded vowels and . They are replaced in Yiddish by (in the case of the short ), (in the case of the long ) and (in the case of ), respectively.\n\nDiphthongs have also undergone divergent developments in German and Yiddish. Where Standard German has merged the Middle High German diphthong \"ei\" and long vowel \"ī\" to \"ei\" (pronounced ), Standard Yiddish has maintained the distinction between them as and , respectively. The German (as in \"kaufen\", 'buy') corresponds to the Yiddish (in ); lastly, the German , as in \"Deutsch\" 'German') corresponds to in Yiddish (in ). Another difference is that the vowel length distinctions of German do not exist in Standard Yiddish.\n\nThere are consonantal differences between German and Yiddish. Yiddish deaffricates the Middle High German voiceless labiodental affricate to initially (as in \"funt\"; though this pronunciation is also quasi-standard throughout northern and central Germany); /pf/ surfaces as an unshifted medially or finally (as in and ). Additionally, final voiced stops appear in Standard Yiddish but not Northern Standard German.\n\n"}
