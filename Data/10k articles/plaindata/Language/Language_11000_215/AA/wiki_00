The language classification of Bukharic is as follows: Indo-European > Indo-Iranian > Iranian > West Iranian > Southwest Iranian > Persian > Tajik > Bukharic.\n\nBukhori is based on a substrate of classical Persian, with a large number of Hebrew loanwords, as well as smaller numbers of loanwords from other surrounding languages, including Uzbek and Russian. The vocabulary consists of a mixture of Persian, Arabic, Uzbek, and Hebrew words.\n\nIn early history of the Bukharian Jews, Central Asia fell under Sunni Uzbek control. The Bukharian Jewish community was severely discriminated against and isolated from the other Jews, as well as the Uzbek people. This pushed Bukharian Jews to create their own branch of Judaism, which lead to the creation of the Bukhori dialect spoken throughout Bukharian history.\n\nIn 1987, the total number of speakers was 85,000. In the USSR, there were 45,000 speakers; in Israel, there were 32,000; and in all other countries combined, there were 3,000. One of the dialects of Bukharic is Rahamĭm. Ethnic Tajik minorities exist in many countries, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan. Later Samarkand and Bukhara in Uzbekistan are two cities which are particularly populated.\n\nToday, the language is spoken by approximately 10,000 Jews remaining in Uzbekistan and surrounding areas, although most of its speakers reside elsewhere, predominantly in Israel (approximately 50,000 speakers), and the United States.\n\nLike most Jewish languages, Bukhori traditionally used the Hebrew alphabet. But throughout the past century, due to Soviet influence, Bukhori has been written in Latin in the 1920s, then Cyrillic from 1940 onwards. The Hebrew alphabet fell further into disuse outside of Hebrew liturgy when the Bukharian Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia and Bukharian Jewish publications, such as books and newspapers, began to appear using the Cyrillic alphabet. Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian only know the Cyrillic alphabet when reading and writing Bukharian. The origin of its respective spelling system is Talmudic orthography.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, communists wanted Hebrew to be the language of culture and instruction in the Republic of Turkestan and in the Soviet’s People Republic of Bukhara. In late 1921, the Turkestani People’s Commissariat of Education ordered that schools for Bukharan Jews to teach in Bukharic and not in Hebrew. In Uzbekistan in 1934, 15 Bukharan Jewish clubs and 28 Bukharan Jewish red teahouses existed. However, in 1938, Bukharic was no longer used as the language for instruction in the schools and in cultural activities.\n\nThere were attempts made to bring back Bukharan Jewish culture in the Soviet Union. One significant attempt was a council was established for Bukharan Jewish literature in the Uzbekistan Writers’ Union and was headed by Aharon Shalamaev-Fidoi (Shalamaev-Fidoi left for Israel in 1991). Another significant attempt was the \"Hoverim\" society was established in Tajikistan and was headed by Professor Datkhaev (Datkhaev left for the USA in 1992). An organization today that is continuing to support the Bukharan Jewish culture is the World Bukharian Jewish Congress. This organization is introducing to the public the unique story of the Bukharan Jews. Their goal is for others to learn about the history of the Bukharan Jews, as well as their culture, language and literature. Based on the Soviet census of 1979, 20% more of Central Asian Jews spoke Russian instead of Bukharic.\n\nAmong some Bukharian Jewish youth, especially in the New York City area, there has been a revival of using the Bukharian Jewish language written in a modified Latin alphabet similar to the one developed by Bukharian Jewish linguist and writer, Yakub Kalontarov. Today, youths learning the Bukharian Jewish language sponsored by the Achdut-Unity Club in Queens use the modified Latin alphabet.\n\nClasses on Bukharian Jewish history and the Bukhori language are also available at Queens College, CUNY since 2010, marking the first time that Bukhori has been taught in an American university. The classes are taught by Bukharian adjunct professor Imanuel Rybakov.\n\n\n"}

The host, the program announcer or a continuity announcer states the title (if any) of the presentation, the name of the program, and the broadcast or cable network, though not necessarily in that order. On children's television networks, they are sometimes called external eyecatches due to the resemblance of internal eyecatches in anime and there is usually no voice over, but some bumpers do feature one. Bumper music, often a recurring signature or theme music segment, is nearly always featured. Bumpers can vary from simple text to short films.\n\nSince 1976, most network television programs in the United States no longer use commercial bumpers; although some soap operas such as \"Days of Our Lives\" (which stopped using one in 2010) and \"The Young and the Restless\", as well as the game show \"The Price is Right\", still feature mid-show bumpers. Commercial bumpers are still a common feature of radio. In radio, they are often used during sports broadcasts to ease the transition from play by play to commercial break and back to live action, as well as notify local stations that they should insert their station identification and/or commercials, many times using obscure musical selections of the board operator's choosing. One notable example of commercial bumpers still in use can be found on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim, whose extensive usage of bumpers has even spawned its own website. Another example of commercial bumpers in radio was their use in syndicated programming; for instance, the radio countdown programs \"American Top 40\" and \"American Country Countdown\" feature a series of pre-recorded jingles and other outcues to transition to and from commercial breaks.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, in accordance with then-current regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission that required a distinction between programs and commercials, most children's programming bumpers would include the phrase \"We'll be [right] back after these messages\", except for the bump before the final commercial break, which would usually say, \"And now, these messages.\" The FCC significantly relaxed these rules in 1984. Another common bumper phrase was \"And now, a word from our sponsor.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a break-bumper is a brief appearance of a logo before or after advertising breaks, usually that of the television channel being watched.\n\nBreak-bumpers can either be animated or static. They are sometimes branded to advertise a special programme or event that will be broadcast on that channel, such as sporting events.\n\nIn Australia, a break-bumper can be a brief appearance of a programme logo, animated logo, title card or an animated title card, just before an advertising break.\n\nBreak-bumpers can also be either animated or static information bars that appear for a few seconds, with program title and the logo of the television channel being watched. These are more often seen after a break and sometimes followed by information bars that show what programme is coming next or later.\n\nIn Japan, an or internal eyecatch is a scene or illustration used to begin and end a commercial break in a television program, especially in anime and tokusatsu shows. The term is used, in Japan, to refer to all kinds of bumpers.\n\nIn many television series, eyecatches are contemporaneous into the climax of a story, leading onto speculation during the commercial break.\n\nUnlike in American programs, in which bumpers are typically supplied by the network (when they have them at all), eyecatches are almost always produced by the production company and considered a part of the program itself, rather than (or also serving as) a segue into a commercial break. They are typically two to six seconds in length. Eyecatches for children's programs are often longer and more elaborate, while eyecatches for programming intended for adults may consist of nothing more than the program's logo against a black background.\nIn the 1990s, commercial bumpers were used by terrestrial television networks. Similar to those in the United Kingdom, it is a short appearance of a logo or a slide to remind the viewers of the programme being aired, which appears before or after breaks. The logo is usually that of the television channel or station being watched and/or of the programme's title. However, as the years passed on until the late 2000s, this changed to feature a message that the programme will return after the break ends, which is now more commonly seen on RTM's TV1 and TV2 and Media Prima's NTV7, 8TV and TV9. TV3 also uses this for sponsored programmes, but as of 2013, it also uses them for non-sponsored programs, such as children's programmes. The 1990s bumper style, however, is sometimes used sparingly.\n\nSince 2003, nearly all of Astro's satellite television channels feature break bumpers that are placed before and after breaks. These bumpers consist of the logo of the aforementioned channels, as well as a slide promoting the current programme being broadcast and the next programme scheduled to air. Bumpers based on the subscription information sequence seen at the end of Astro Box Office promotional trailers from 2003 to 2006, appear in-between commercials and immediately before the program break ends, but not at the beginning of the block of replaced commercials.\n\nIn Argentina, since around September 2010, it is compulsory for almost all broadcasters to use a commercial bumper, using the words \"Espacio publicitario\" (Commercial break) to separate the rest of the programme from the advertisements.\n\nIn Poland, television networks usually separate the rest of the programming with the word \"Reklama\" (\"Commercial\").\n\nIn Russia, networks like Channel One and Russia 1 use the commercial bumpers as they appear as a one-off bumper. Channel One used the commercial idents as sting thru November 2004 to 31 August 2011 , As they started to use the short-lived commercial ident package called \"The Four Seasons\" which ran thru 1 September 2011 to 31 August 2012 , In these commercial idents the music was actually mostly classical with piano and violins, As they started to use the current commercial ident package \"Clocks\" which featured three separate piano pieces \"Morning\" (September 2012 to September 2013) and the popular \"Noon\" (which is the one that is the current piano piece should be used to this day) and \"Night\" (which they have started to use in 2016) they also used the 3-note piece as their three commercial idents debuted in 2012 and used the 3-note piece. In the international versions of these idents, They have used the information about to suggest an commercial. But networks like NTV use the commercial idents as an intro and outro idents. One of the famous commercial ident from NTV is the \"Rectangle on the NTV\" which has been used as an ident thru 6 September 1998 to 31 May 2001. Which in these idents feature the NTV logo being in an rectangle-shaped scope. At the beginning of each idents, the reminiscent of the commercial idents from 1996 or 1994. In the end of the commercials, flag and a part of the ident is shown. Another one is the short-lived one used from 1 June to 8 September 2001. Which in these commercial idents show the metal soviet pieces from 1980s and 1990s. Basically new year idents of Channel One are always festive. starting with 1995 when the famous things of Christmas should be shown like Santa Claus and Christmas Tree and especially Spasskaya Tower. 1996 shouldn't have a festive offering but logo is in snow. Starting with 1997, new year commercial idents are born. First of them would be the one with a snowman doing something weird. These commercial idents are ran from 24 December 1997 to 11 January 1998. Some of the most memorable new year commercial idents from Channel One we're the 2008 one. which features a Christmas tree with cards being animated. This one was ran thru 22 December 2008 to 11 January 2009 and returned in 21 December 2009 to 10 January 2010. Which the 2010 one had an inspiration from A Trip to the Moon featured an rocket's adventures in Moscow. For some reason the commercial idents did not have the word \"реклама\" when it was uploaded to Vimeo. Actually in the TV version did have the word \"реклама\". This ran from 20 December 2010 to 10 January 2011. But the Channel One had brought back the 2008 one in December 2011, Only difference is that the scope is now in 16:9. And the 2008 ident had being repeated in 2012 and 2013.\n\nBumpers or external eyecatches on children's television networks, and sometimes other networks are similar to the internal eyecatches used in Japanese anime, with the difference being that the bumpers are supplied by the network. These usually appear only at the end of commercial breaks, but sometimes leading into the start of the break as well. Their primary purpose is to alert children that the commercial break has ended. Depending on the network, the bumper may or may not feature a voice over.\n\nOften, these eyecatches have a secondary purpose: marketing. Canadian network YTV, for example, uses them to help children learn to identify the network and thus increase brand awareness. Most children's television networks run these bumpers because of this reason. From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s periods, Nickelodeon in conjunction with branding firm Fred/Alan, Inc. created 225 bumpers, some featuring catchy doo-wop jingles recorded by a cappella group The Jive Five.\n\n"}

His novels and stories had impact of existentialism, his characters are suffering and frustrated yet surviving. \"Ekra\" (1963) is one such example. In his novels, the story was a chief element.

He wrote historical fiction like \"Atitvan\" and \"Ayanvritta\". His short stories have themes like complexities of urban life, emotional outbursts, and the atmosphere of war. He wrote extensively on history and culture. According to \"Rediff\", his writing was 'sharp and brutal' when he criticised people he disliked. His biography \"Bakshinama\" was partially published in serialised form in Gujarati daily \"Samkalin\".

In some legal jurisdictions, and for certain behaviors, it may prevent the accuser from prevailing.\n\nFor example, if a creditor states that they forgive a certain debt, they might be blocked (or estopped) from attempting to collect that debt later. They would not be blocked from collecting any \"other\" debts, however.\nCondonation may also be a defense in cases of dismissal from employment for cause where the employer by word or conduct forgives or impliedly forgives behavior which would otherwise justify dismissal without notice.\n\nOn the other hand, condonation is irrelevant to some acts. For example, some jurisdictions prohibit fighting by consent (other than in specially-sanctioned sports, such as boxing). In such a jurisdiction, people arrested for brawling cannot avoid prosecution by condoning one another's assaults.\n\nThe principle of condonation in military law is traced back to the \"Memorandum on Corporal Punishment\" issued by the Duke of Wellington on 4 March 1832:\nPrior to the advent of no-fault divorce statutes, condonation was frequently asserted as a defense to divorce. Although one spouse may have committed an act that justified the other in obtaining a divorce, the other spouse might be deemed to have forgiven the conduct and thus waived the right to sue for divorce. The most typical way in which condonation occurred is if the wronged spouse, with knowledge of the act, voluntarily engaged in sexual relations with the wrongdoer. Critics of the doctrine contended that it discouraged spouses from attempting reconciliation, as one act of sexual intercourse would deprive the wronged spouse of any relief if the spouses were unable to resolve their differences.\n\nThe principle of condonation or near-equivalents can shield those who commit honor killings from punishment: \n\n"}

On the other hand, there is the piece \"I hope you don’t entirely disapprove\", which is inserted in the host construction but neither syntactically nor semantically, nor prosodically integrated in the host construction, and rather than contributing to the meaning of the sentence, it relates to the situation of discourse. Such inserts are commonly known as parentheticals or extra-clausal constituents. In the framework of Discourse Grammar they are referred to as \"theticals\", and cooptation is the operation that enables speakers to transfer them from one domain of grammar to the other, and to place them in various slots of the host construction.\n\nSentence Grammar is organized in terms of propositional concepts and clauses and their combination while Thetical Grammar concerns the linguistic discourse beyond the sentence. While being in principle separate domains, the two interact in various ways in organizing linguistic discourse, and the main way of interaction is via cooptation. Cooptation is fully productive, that is, it can be employed by speakers any time to structure speech.

Defeasance in a bill of sale is the putting an end to the security by realizing the goods for the benefit of the mortgagee. It is not strictly a defeasance, because the stipulation is in the same deed; it is really a condition in the nature of a defeasance.\n\n"}

Attacks by the French and British armies against the \"Westheer\" on the Western Front had been met in 1915 and 1916 by increasing the number and sophistication of trench networks, the original improvised defences of 1914 giving way to a centrally-planned system of trenches in a trench-position and then increasing numbers of trench-positions, to absorb the growing firepower and offensive sophistication of the Entente armies.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Somme (1 July – 18 November 1916), the use of defensive lines began to evolve into the defence of the areas between them, using the local troops of the trench holding divisions and (relief divisions), held back beyond the range of Franco-British artillery, to replace front line divisions as they became exhausted. In the winter of 1916–1917, the use of such divisions and the fortified zones between trench lines was codified and divisions trained in the new defensive tactics. Training was based on the experience of the defensive battles of 1916 and the new principles of fortification, to provide the infrastructure for the new system of defensive battle by and (counter-attack divisions).\nThe new defensive principles and fortifications were used in 1917 to resist the Franco-British offensives. After failures at Verdun in December 1916 and at Arras in April 1917, the system of fortifications defended by \"Stellungsdivisionen\" supported by \"Eingreif\" divisions counter-attacking from the rear was vindicated during the French attacks of the Nivelle Offensive. The continuation of British attacks at Arras in the wake of the French debacle on the Aisne, led to the highest rate of casualties per day of the war but the system failed again at the Battle of Messines. German defensive tactics reached their ultimate refinement during the Third Battle of Ypres and there were only slight alterations during the defensive battles of late 1918. In the interwar period, German defensive thinking incorporated the new technology of aircraft, tanks, anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns in a much deeper defensive system filled with positions for delaying actions, before a counter-attack was made by armoured and mechanised formations.\n\nGerman defensive tactics had been based on the publication of 1906 (Drill Regulations for the Infantry), which expected defensive warfare to be short periods between offensives. On the Somme front, the construction plan ordered by Falkenhayn in January 1915 had been completed. Barbed wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt wide to two, wide and about apart. Double and triple thickness wire was used and laid high. The front line had been increased from one line to three, apart, the first trench (, \"battle trench\") occupied by sentry groups, the second (, \"living trench\") for the front-trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dug-outs had been deepened from to , apart and large enough for An intermediate line of strong points () about behind the front line had also been built.\n\nCommunication trenches ran back to the reserve line, renamed the second line, which was as well-built and wired as the first line. The second line was built beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop and move field artillery forward before assaulting the line. After the (Autumn Battle) in Champagne during late 1915, a third line another back from the was begun in February 1916 and was nearly complete when the Battle of the Somme began. German artillery was organised in a series of (barrage sectors). The Somme defences were crowded towards the front trench, with a regiment having two battalions near the front trench system and the reserve battalion divided between the and the second line, all within of the front line.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Somme (1 July – 18 November), General Erich Ludendorff had German defensive doctrine revised. On 1 December, the \"Oberste Heeresleitung\" (\"OHL\", supreme army command) published new tactical instructions, (Principles of Command for Defensive Battle in Positional Warfare), in which the policy of unyielding defence of ground regardless of its tactical value, was replaced. Positions suitable for artillery observation and communication with the rear were to be defended, where an attacking force would \"fight itself to a standstill and use up its resources while the defenders conserve[d] their strength\". Defending infantry would fight in areas, with the front divisions in an outpost zone up to deep behind listening posts, with the main line of resistance placed on a reverse slope, in front of artillery observation posts kept far enough back to retain observation over the outpost zone. Behind the main line of resistance was a (main battle zone), a second defensive area deep, also sited as far as possible on ground hidden from enemy observation, while in view of German artillery observers was to be built. A (rear battle zone) further back was to be occupied by the reserve battalion of each regiment.\n\n\"Erfahrungen der I Armee in der Sommeschlacht\" (Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles), written by Colonel Fritz von Loßberg, Chief of Staff of the 1st Army was published on 30 January 1917. During the Battle of the Somme, Loßberg had been able to establish a line of (relief divisions), with the reinforcements from Verdun, which had arrived in greater numbers in September 1916. In his analysis, Loßberg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire, as he believed that manoeuvre did not allow the garrisons to evade Allied artillery fire, which could blanket the forward area and would invite opposing infantry to occupy vacant areas. Loßberg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter-attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the means to conduct an organised defence, which the dispersal of infantry over a wider area had already made difficult. Loßberg and other officers had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct a from behind the battle zone. The sceptics wanted the Somme practice of fighting in the front line to be retained and authority devolved no further than the battalion to maintain control, ready for a (organised counter-attack) after by the relief divisions. Ludendorff added the analysis to the new .\n\n (Principles of Field Fortification) was published in January 1917 on which new defensive fortifications were to be based, to provide the infrastructure for the new defensive tactics. By April an outpost zone () held by sentries, had been built along the Western Front. Sentries could retreat to larger positions () held by (five men and an NCO per ), who would join the sentries to recapture sentry-posts by immediate counter-attack. Defensive procedures in the battle zone were similar but with greater numbers. The front trench system was the sentry line for the battle zone garrison, which was allowed to move away from concentrations of enemy fire and then counter-attack to recover the battle and outpost zones; such withdrawals were envisaged as occurring on small parts of the battlefield, which had been made untenable by Allied artillery fire, as the prelude to (immediate counter-attack within the position). Such a decentralised battle by large numbers of small infantry detachments would present the attacker with unforeseen obstructions. The further the penetration, the greater the density of defenders, equipped with automatic weapons, camouflaged and supported by observed artillery fire. A school was opened in January 1917 to teach infantry commanders the new methods.\n\n\"Eingreif\" is generally translated as \"counter-attack\" but the term had other connotations. In German military thinking, it included a sense of intervening and is better understood as \"interlocking\" or \"dovetailing\", in which the \"Eingreifdivision\" came under the command of the \"Stellungsdivision\" and joined with the defensive garrison and its fortifications. The term was adopted during the Battle of Arras (9 April – 16 May 1917) to replace (relief division), to end confusion over the purpose of divisions held in readiness. There were also calls for each \"Stellungsdivision\" to have the support of an \"Eingreifdivision\" but Ludendorff could not find sufficient divisions for this. J. E. Edmonds, the British official historian, called the divisions \"special reserve\" or \"super counter-attack\" divisions. Such methods required large numbers of reserve divisions, ready to counter-attack, which were obtained by creating divisions, moving some divisions from the eastern front and Operation Alberich (\"Unternehmen Alberich\") in March 1917, which shortened the front. By the spring, the German army in the west had accumulated a strategic reserve of Over the winter, certain divisions were trained as \"Eingreifdivisionen\" but a strict distinction between these divisions and the remaining \"Stellungsdivisionen\" could not always be maintained.\n\nThe new system reflected the views of Carl von Clausewitz that defensive battle should not be passive but one of deflection and attack (\"eine Verbindung von Parade und Stoss\"), with the \"Eingreif\" divisions providing a \"flashing sword of retaliation\" (\"das blitzende Vergeltungsschwert\"). On 1 January 1917, General Otto von Moser was appointed to lead a new \"Divisionskommandeur Schule\" at Solesmes near the Belgian border, to teach the new defensive thinking with a training ground and a Testing and Instructional Division at full establishment for demonstrations. The first course from was attended by about of the \"Westheer\" who attended morning lectures and afternoon exercises and a second course run from was also attended by some officers from the Eastern Front and three Austro-Hungarian army observers. The third course from included officers from other armies of the Central Powers and then Moser took over command of the XIV Reserve Corps. Many of the students accepted the new defensive thinking but Loßberg and other dissenters objected to discretion to retreat being given to the front garrison and a second school was set up at Sedan for the officers of \"Heeresgruppe Deutscher Kronprinz\". During the British preparatory bombardment of Messines Ridge before the attack on 7 June, the 24th Division was relieved by the 35th Division and the 40th Division by the 3rd Bavarian Division, the local \"Eingreif\" divisions and these were replaced by the 7th Division and the 1st Guard Reserve Division, unfamiliar with the area and not trained \"Eingreifdivisionen\". Some were retained as they were rebuilt after spending time in the line; the 24th Division was given six weeks' rest and reconstituted as the \"Eingreifdivision\" of Group Aubers before returning to Flanders on 11 August. The 23rd Reserve Division acted as a \"Stellungsdivision\" from 23 June to 29 July, spent August recuperating and September as an \"Eingreifdivision\" for Group Dixmude, before being rushed to Group Ypres on 20 September to relieve the 2nd Guard Division.\n\nWhen the 183rd Division arrived in Flanders became an \"Eingreifdivisionen\" for \"Gruppe Ypren\". The divisional artillery had been reorganised, with the medium and heavy guns participating in conventional artillery bombardments and the three battalions of Field Artillery Regiment 183 being divided between the three infantry regiments. Each infantry regiment received two assault batteries and a platoon of Reserve Engineer Battalion 16, to provide observed and direct fire. Training in the new role led to infantry companies being reorganised and new specialisms being introduced. The three platoons in each company became a rifle section, an assault group, a grenade-launcher troop and a light machine-gun section. The use of hand grenades became more important and coloured flares were used as the quickest way to signal to the rear.\n\nThe German army distinguished between a hasty counter-attack () to prevent an opponent from consolidating captured positions and an organised counter-attack (), which took place after a period for reconnaissance, reinforcement and preliminary artillery fire. The new tactics required commanders to act on their initiative and troops to perform complicated manoeuvres in battle, which could only be implemented through a comprehensive training programme to make it possible. \"Eingreif\" divisions were to wait in readiness at the rear of the defensive zone to join the more immediate engagements, if troops held in reserve by the were insufficient to restore the position. With the increasing Allied superiority in munitions and manpower, attackers might still penetrate to the second (artillery protection) line, leaving German garrisons isolated in (\"Widas\", resistance nests), still inflicting losses and disorganisation on the attackers. As the attackers tried to capture the and dig in near the German second line, and of the \"Eingreif\" divisions would advance from the into the battle zone, in an immediate counter-attack (). If the immediate counter-attack failed, the \"Eingreif\" divisions would take to prepare a (organised counter-attack), if the lost ground was essential for the retention of the main position.\n\nThe British advance in the centre of the front had caused serious concern to the German commanders. Penetration of the defensive system was expected but the advance in the centre of the attack had not been anticipated. At noon, the British advance on the Gheluvelt Plateau to the south had been stopped by the local German defenders and their artillery. In the centre, regiments of the 221st and 50th Reserve Divisions, the \"Eingreif\" divisions at the rear of the Group Ypres defensive zone, advanced over the Broodseinde–Passchendaele ridge, unseen by British reconnaissance aircraft. The \"Eingreif\" regiments began their advance from and the German artillery began a creeping barrage at along the centre of the British front. The \"Eingreif\" regiments drove back the three most advanced British brigades, inflicting casualties, recaptured the Zonnebeke–Langemarck road and St Julien, before the advance was stopped on the black line (second objective) by mud, the British artillery and machine-gun fire. The \"Eingreif\" divisions had little success on the northern flank of the Anglo-French attack, where the attackers had time to dig in. After losing many men to British artillery-fire while advancing around Langemarck, the Germans managed to push back a small British bridgehead on the east bank of the Steenbeek; the French repulsed the Germans around St Janshoek and followed up to capture Bixschoote. Counter-attacks in the afternoon by the \"Stellungsdivisionen\" on the southern flank, intended to recapture Westhoek Ridge, were able to advance a short distance from Glencorse Wood before British artillery-fire and a counter-attack pushed them back again.\n\nThe leading regiment of an \"Eingreif\" division was to advance into the zone of the front division, with its other two regiments moving forward in close support. The support and reserve assembly areas in the \"Flandern Stellung\" were termed \"Fredericus Rex Raum\" and \"Triarier Raum\", an analogy with the structure of a Roman legion. \"Eingreif\" divisions were accommodated behind the front line and began their advance to their assembly areas in the rear zone (), ready to intervene in the main battle zone (). After the defeat of Menin Road Ridge, the German defensive deployment was changed. In August, German \"Stellungsdivisionen\" had two regiments of three battalions each forward, with the third regiment in reserve. The front battalions had needed to be relieved much more frequently than expected, due to constant British bombardments and the weather, which had caused units to become mixed up. Reserve regiments had not been able to intervene quickly, leaving front battalions unsupported until \"Eingreif\" divisions arrived, some hours after the commencement of the attack. The deployment was changed to increase the number of troops in the front zone. By 26 September all three regiments of the front-line division were forward, each holding an area wide and deep; one battalion was placed in the front-line, the second in support and the third in close reserve.\n\nThe battalions were to move forward successively, to engage fresh enemy battalions, which had leap-frogged through those that had delivered the first attack. The \"Eingreif\" divisions were to deliver an organised attack with artillery support later in the day, before the British could consolidate their new line. The change was intended to remedy the neutralisation of the front division reserves, which had been achieved by the British artillery on 20 September, so that they could intervene before the \"Eingreif\" divisions arrived. On 22 September, new tactical requirements were laid down: more artillery counter-bombardment was to be used between British attacks, half against British artillery and half against infantry, increased raiding was ordered to induce the British to hold their positions in greater strength, giving German artillery a denser target; better artillery observation was demanded in the battle zone, to increase the accuracy of German artillery fire when British troops advanced into it and quicker counter-attacks were to be made.\n\nFollowing the costly defeats of Menin Road on 20 September and Polygon Wood on 26 September, the German commanders made more changes to the defensive organisation and altered their counter-attack tactics, which had been negated by the British combination of limited attack and much greater artillery firepower than August. \"Eingreif\" divisions had engaged in \"an advance to contact during mobile operations\" in August, which had achieved several costly defensive successes. German counter-attacks in September had been \"assaults on reinforced field positions\", due to the short British infantry advances and emphasis on defeating (\"instant-immediate counter-attacks\"). The period of dry weather and clear skies which began in early September, had greatly increased the effectiveness of British air observation and artillery fire. German counter-attacks were defeated with heavy casualties, after arriving too late to take advantage of disorganisation. The British changes meant that a defence in depth had been swiftly established on reverse slopes, behind standing barrages, in dry, clear weather, with specialist air reconnaissance for observation of German troop movements and improved contact patrolling and ground-attack operations by the RFC. German artillery which was able to fire, despite British counter-battery shelling, became unsystematic due to uncertainty over the whereabouts of German infantry and British infantry benefitted from the opposite. On 28 September Albrecht von Thaer, Staff Officer at Group Wytschaete wrote that the experience was \"awful\" and that he did not know what to do.\n\nLudendorff later wrote that he had regularly discussed the situation with General Hermann von Kuhl and Loßberg, to try to find a remedy for the overwhelming British attacks. Ludendorff ordered a strengthening of the forward garrisons by the ground holding divisions and all machine-guns, including those of the support and reserve battalions of the front line regiments, were sent into the forward zone, to form a cordon of four to eight guns every . The regiment of each \"Eingreif\" division, was placed behind each front division in the artillery protective line behind the forward battle zone, which increased the ratio of \"Eingreif\" divisions to The regiment was to be available to launch counter-attacks while the British were consolidating; the remainder of each \"Eingreif\" division was to be withheld for a (methodical counter-attack) on the next day or the one after. Between British attacks, the \"Eingreif\" divisions were to make more spoiling attacks.\n\nA 4th Army operation order on 30 September pointed out that the German position in Flanders was restricted by the local topography, the proximity of the coast and the Dutch frontier, which made local withdrawals impossible. The instructions of 22 September were to be followed, with more bombardment by field artillery, using at least half of the heavy artillery ammunition, for observed fire on infantry positions in captured pillboxes, command posts, machine-gun nests, on duck board tracks and field railways. Gas bombardment was to be increased, on forward positions and artillery emplacements, when the wind allowed. Every effort was to be made to induce the British to reinforce their forward positions, where the German artillery could engage them, by making spoiling attacks to recapture pillboxes, improve defensive positions and harass the British infantry, with patrols and diversionary bombardments. From the Germans attacked and counter-attacked at least . British intelligence predicted the German changes in an intelligence summary of 1 October, foreseeing the big German counter-attack planned for 4 October.\n\nOn 7 October, the 4th Army abandoned the reinforcement of the front defence zone, after the \"black day\" of 4 October. Front line regiments were dispersed again, with reserve battalions moved back behind the artillery protective line and \"Eingreif\" divisions organised to intervene as swiftly as possible, despite the risk of being devastated by the British artillery. Counter-battery fire against British artillery was to be increased to protect the \"Eingreif\" divisions as they advanced. Ludendorff insisted on an advanced zone, () deep, to be occupied by a thin line of sentries with a few machine-guns. The sentries were to retire on the main line of resistance () at the back of this advanced zone when attacked, while the artillery was quickly to barrage the area in front of it. Support and reserve battalions of the front-line and \"Eingreif\" divisions, would gain time to move up to the main line of resistance, where the battle would be fought, if artillery-fire had not stopped the British infantry advance. An \"Eingreif\" division was to be placed behind each front-line division, with instructions to ensure that it reached the British before they could consolidate. If a swift counter-attack was not possible, there was to be a delay to organise a methodical counter-attack, after ample artillery preparation. Armin ordered on 11 October that the \"Stellungs-\" and \"Eingreif-\" divisions of groups Staden, Ypres and part of Group Wijtschate were to take turns in the front line, \"Eingreif\" becoming more of a role than an identity. The revised defensive scheme was promulgated on 13 October, over Rupprecht's objections.\n\nArtillery-fire was to replace the machine-gun defence of the forward zone as far as possible, which Rupprecht believed would allow the British artillery too much freedom to operate. The thin line of sentries of one or two (thirteen men and a light machine-gun each) in company sectors proved inadequate, as the British were easily able to attack them and lift prisoners. At the end of October, the sentry line was replaced by a conventional outpost system of double . The German defensive system had become based on two divisions, holding a front wide and deep, half the area that two divisions previously were expected to hold. The necessity of such reinforcement was caused by the weather, devastating British artillery-fire and the decline in the numbers and quality of German infantry. Concealment () was emphasised, to protect the divisions from British fire power, by avoiding anything resembling a trench system, in favour of dispersal in crater fields. Such a method was only made feasible by the rapid rotation of units; battalions of the front-divisions were relieved after two days and divisions every six days. On 23 October, the \"Stellungsdivision\" commander was given command of the \"Eingreifdivision\", creating a new two-division tactical unit. The quicker rotation of divisions led to the distinction between \"Eingreif\" divisions and \"Stellungsdivisions\", becoming tenuous and more one of the task rather than the division. In late November, Ludendorff ordered all of the armies on the Western Front to adopt the new system.\n\nGerman defensive battle tactics reached their culmination at the Third Battle of Ypres; the counter-offensive at Cambrai was a conventional \"Gegenangriff\" and in 1918, minor changes to nomenclature and the \"Vorfeld\" and \"Hauptwiederstandslinie\" system were made because of mechanisation within the army. The \"Vorpostenfeld\" (outpost zone) became the \"Kampffeld\" (advanced battle zone) at the front, with the \"Hauptkampffeld\" (main battle zone), the \"Grosskampffeld\" (greater battle zone), the \"Rückwärtige Stellung\" (rear position) further back then the \"Rückwärtiges Kampffeld\" (rear battle zone). \"Eingreif\" divisions were based from behind the front line and expected to fight the main defensive battle in the \"Grosskampffeld\". The \"Kampffeld\" was held with as few troops as possible, exploiting flanking fire from machine-guns and single field guns. The front line was along the forward edge of the \"Grosskampffeld\" and covered the field artillery positions supporting the troops in the \"Kapmpffeld\". Further back were positions for the counter-attack troops of the \"Stellungsdivision\", to provide time for the \"Eingreif\" divisions to close up and counter-attack along with the local reserves.\n\nOn 20 July 1918, Ludendorff sent Loßberg to report on the conditions in the Marne Salient, who found that the system devised for the operations in Flanders in 1917 was unworkable in the terrain of the Vesle and Aisne valleys. The unspoilt countryside was full of trees and standing crops; terrain dispersed defences were incapable of resisting tank attacks from the flanks and rear with so much cover for the attackers. Defences were changed back a line of observation groups in front of the main line of resistance, the groups having increased firepower, to force an attacker to deploy sooner. Delaying actions, moving back through lines of observation were developed into a holding action (\"hinhaltendes gefecht\"). \n\nThe relative success of the defensive system at Ypres in 1917 was not repeated in 1918 on the Santerre in Picardy or the downlands west of Cambrai. The \"Vorpostenfeld\" could be overrun behind creeping barrages at night or in twilight and there were too few \"Eingreif\" divisions to counter-attack, those present being capable only of local attacks or reinforcement of the defenders. German divisions were smaller than earlier in the war, had more machine-guns and better command arrangements but the system of linked \"Stellungsdivisionen\" and \"Eingreifdivisionen\" was most demanding of manpower; British attacks in late 1918 rarely outnumbered the defenders, relying on initiative and surprise.\n\nWriting in 1939, Wynne described contemporary German defensive principles that resembled the defence of Flanders in 1917, with the depth of the defensive position increased to about , filled with lines of resistance (\"Sicherungs-Widerstandslinie\") from which to fight a delaying action. Static defences would be backed by mechanised and motorised \"Eingreif\" divisions ready to use speed, firepower and shock in a \"Gegenstoss auf der Tiefe\" (counter-attack from the rear). Inside the defensive position, anti-aircraft, anti-tank guns and mobile anti-tank guns would inflict losses on the opposing tanks and aircraft that were supporting the infantry attack but the fixed defences of the \"Siegfried Line\" were less important than the \"flashing sword of retaliation\".\n\nBooks\n\nTheses\n\n"}

However, word order is flexible, and the emphatic word can be placed first in the sentence. Hawaiian largely avoids subordinate clauses, and often uses a possessive construction instead.\n\nHawaiian, like English, is a non-pro-drop language. Nonetheless, there is an exception with commands, where the use of subject pronouns is optional. In these cases, the subject pronoun is seldom used if the context deems it unnecessary, as in \"e hele i ke kula\" \"[imperfective] go to the school\", \"go to school\"; here, the subject \"you\" is understood, and can be omitted.\n\nThe typical detailed word order is given by the following, with most items optional:\n\nIf the sentence has a negative mood and the subject is a pronoun, word order is subject–verb–object following the negator \"ʻaʻole\", as in:\n\nAnother exception is when an emphatic adverbial phrase begins the sentence. In this case, a pronoun subject precedes the verb. \n\nYes-no questions can be unmarked and expressed by intonation, or they can be marked by placing \"anei\" after the leading word of the sentence. Examples of question-word questions include:\n\nSee also Hawaiian Language: Syntax and other resources.\n\nA verb can be nominalized by preceding it with the definite article. Within the noun phrase, adjectives follow the noun (e.g. \"ka hale liilii\" \"the house small\", \"the small house\"), while possessors precede it (e.g. \"kou hale\" \"your house\"). Numerals precede the noun in the absence of the definite article, but follow the noun if the noun is preceded by the definite article.\n\nIn Hawaiian, there is no gender distinction based on biological sex. The word for third person (he, she, it) is \"ia\". It is commonly preceded by \"o\" as in \"o ia\" but should always be written as two words, never as one.\n\nHawaiian nouns belong to one of two genders, known as the \"kino ʻō\" (o-class) and the \"kino ʻā\" (a-class). These classes are only taken into account when using the genitive case (see table of personal pronouns below).\n\n\"Kino ʻō\" nouns, in general, are nouns whose creation cannot be controlled by the subject, such as \"inoa\" \"name\", \"puuwai\" \"heart\", and \"hale\" \"house\". Specific categories for o-class nouns include: modes of transportation (e.g. \"kaa\" \"car\" and \"lio\" \"horse\"), things that you can go into, sit on or wear (e.g., \"lumi\" \"room\", \"noho\" \"chair\", \"eke\" \"bag\", and \"lole\" \"clothes\"), and people in your generation (e.g., siblings, cousins) and previous generations (e.g. \"makuahine\" \"mother\").\n\n\"Kino ʻā\" nouns, in general, are those whose creation can be controlled, such as \"waihooluu\" \"color\", as in \"kau waihooluu punahele\" \"my favorite color\". Specific categories include: your boyfriend or girlfriend (\"ipo\"), spouse, friends, and future generations in your line (all of your descendants).\n\nThe change of preposition of \"o\" \"of\" (kino ʻō) to \"a\" \"of \"(kino ʻā) is especially important for prepositional and subordinate phrases:\n\n\"ka mea\" \"the thing\"\n\n\"kona mea\" \"his thing (nonspecific)\"\n\n\"kāna mea\" \"his thing (which he created or somehow chose)\"\n\n\"ka mea āna i ʻike ai\" \"the thing that he saw\"\n\n\"kāna (mea) i ʻike ai\" \"what he saw\"\n\n\"kēia ʻike ʻana āna\" \"this thing that he saw (purposefully)\"\n\n\"kēia ʻike ʻana ona\" \"this thing that he saw (purportedly)\" where the seeing isn't much import\n\nVerbs can be analytically modified to indicate tense, aspect and mood as follows:\n\n\nIn his \"Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar,\" W.D. Alexander proposed that Hawaiian has a pluperfect tense as follows:\nHowever, this is debatable since \"ʻē\" simply means \"beforehand, in advance, already\". Andrews [Gram. 1.4] suggested the same thing that Alexander forwards. However, \"Ua hana ʻē au\" could mean both \"I have already worked\", \"I already worked\", and (depending on the temporal context) \"I had worked previous to that moment.\" \"Already\" is the operative unifier for these constructions as well as the perfective quality denoted by \"ua\". \"ʻĒ\" therefore is acting like a regular Hawaiian adverb, following the verb it modifies:\n\n\"Ua hana paha au.\" Perhaps I worked.\n\n\"Ua hana mālie au.\" I worked steadily, without disruption.\n\n\"Ua hana naʻe au.\" I even worked.\n\nHawaiian doesn't have a copula verb meaning \"to be\" nor does it have a verb meaning \"to have\".

Although he spoke other languages perfectly (Hebrew, Russian, Polish, German, possibly Ukrainian), he chose to write in Yiddish. Together with Salomon Ettinger, he was one of the first Yiddish-language writers of the 19th century and one of the most significant Yiddish writers to emerge before Mendele Mocher Sforim.\n\nHe spent the first period of his life among the Hasidim, being himself a disciple of R. Nahman Bratzlaver (from Bratslav, a town in Ukraine, in Yiddish: בראָסלעוו) and the companion of Nathan Bratzlaver (Nathan of Breslov), the editor and publisher of Nahman's works. Later he abandoned his early associations, and removed to Odessa. By self-education he acquired a wide knowledge of law, literature, and science. He practised as a notary public, and was also a prolific writer of fiction. Like nearly all Russo-Jewish novelists, Aksenfeld was a realist. He derived the themes of his works from contemporary Jewish life, describing with the pen of an artist the conditions, manners, and customs of the ghetto in the Russian Empire at the beginning of the eventful reign of Czar Nicholas I. He was the author of about twenty works, of which only five—one novel and four dramas—were printed. The most important of his dramatic works is the play in verse, \"Der erschter jiddischer Rekrut in Russland\" (1861), a tragedy which presents a remarkably vivid picture of the terrible commotion in the Russian ghetto when, in 1827, the ukase compelling the Jews to do military service was enforced for the first time. His novel, \"Dos Sterntichl\" (1861) describes the seamy side of Ḥasidism, its intolerance, bigotry, and hypocrisy, and contrasts it with the fair-mindedness and honesty of progressive Judaism. Another work is \"Sefer Chasidim\" (1841).\n"}

Between 1911 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he headed ethnographic expeditions to various Jewish towns of Volhynia and Podolia, composing a detailed ethnographic questionnaire of more than 2000 questions.\n\nAnsky's ethnographic collections were locked away in Soviet vaults for years, but some material has come to light since the 1990s. The State Ethnographic Museum at St. Petersburg holds a good deal of it. Some of his vast collection of cylinder recordings made on these expeditions have been transferred to CD as well.\n\nHis ethnographic report of the deliberate destruction of Jewish communities by the Russian army in the First World War, \"The Enemy at His Pleasure: A Journey Through the Jewish Pale of Settlement During World War I,\" has become a major source in the historiography of the war's impact on civilian populations.\n\nInitially he wrote in Russian, but from 1904 he became known mainly as a Yiddish author.\n\nHe is best known for his play \"The Dybbuk\" or \"Between Two Worlds\", written in 1914. The play was first staged in the Elyseum Theatre in Warsaw two months after the author's death on November 8, 1920.

It is still being produced, along with numerous adaptations, as well as operas, ballets, and symphonic suites. (For example, in 2011 there were seven different productions.) It is considered the jewel of the Jewish theatre. In the early years \"The Dybbuk\" was considered so significant that parodies of it were written and produced.\n\nAlthough \"The Dybbuk\" is Ansky’s best-known work, he published an impressive number of works of literature, politics and ethnography.

{"id": "585842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=585842", "title": "Sabot", "text": "Sabot\n\nA sabot (, ) is a structural device used in firearm or cannon ammunition to keep a sub-caliber flight projectile, such as a relatively small bullet or arrow-type projectile, in the center of the barrel when fired, if the bullet has a significantly smaller diameter than the bore diameter of the weapon used. \n\nThe sabot component in projectile design is more than simply the relatively thin, tough and deformable seal known as a driving band or obturation ring needed to trap propellant gases behind a projectile, and also keep the projectile centered in the barrel, when the outer shell of the projectile is only slightly smaller in diameter than the caliber of the barrel. Driving bands and obturators are used to seal these full-bore projectiles in the barrel because of manufacturing tolerances; there always exists some gap between the projectile outer diameter and the barrel inner diameter, usually a few thousandths of an inch; enough of a gap for high pressure gasses to slip by during firing. Driving bands and obturator rings are made from material that will deform and seal the barrel as the projectile is forced from the chamber into the barrel. Small caliber jacketed bullets do not normally employ driving bands or obturators because the jacket material, for example copper or gilding metal, is deformable enough to serve that function, and the bullet is made slightly larger than the barrel for that purpose, (see full metal jacket bullet and driving band). \n\nSabots certainly use driving bands and obturators, because the same manufacturing tolerance issues exist when sealing the saboted projectile in the barrel, but the sabot itself is a more substantial structural component of the in-bore projectile configuration (Drysdale 1978). Refer to the two APFSDS (armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot) pictures on the right to see the substantial material nature of a sabot to fill the bore diameter around the sub-caliber arrow-type flight projectile, compared to the very small gap sealed by a driving band or obturator to mitigate what is known classically as windage. More detailed cutaways of the internal structural complexity of advanced APFSDS saboted long rod penetrator projectiles can be found at reference 2.\n\nThe function of a sabot is to provide a larger bulkhead structure that fills the entire bore area between an intentionally designed sub-caliber flight projectile and the barrel, giving a larger surface area for propellant gasses to act upon than just the base of the smaller flight projectile (Drysdale 1978). Efficient aerodynamic design of a flight projectile does not always accommodate efficient interior ballistic design to achieve high muzzle velocity. This is especially true for arrow-type projectiles, which are long and thin for low drag efficiency, but too thin to shoot from a gun barrel of equal diameter to achieve high muzzle velocity. The physics of interior ballistics demonstrates why the use of a sabot is advantageous to achieve higher muzzle velocity with an arrow-type projectile. Propellant gasses generate high pressure, and the larger the base area that pressure acts upon the greater the net force on that surface. Force, pressure times area, provides an acceleration to the mass of the projectile. Therefore, for a given pressure and barrel diameter, a lighter projectile can be driven from a barrel to a higher muzzle velocity than a heavier projectile. However, a lighter projectile may not fit in the barrel, because it is too thin. To make up this difference in diameter, a properly designed sabot provides less parasitic mass than if the flight projectile were made full-bore, in particular providing dramatic improvement in muzzle velocity for APDS (Armor-piercing discarding sabot) and APFSDS ammunition. Seminal research on two important sabot configurations for long rod penetrators used in APFSDS ammunition, namely the \"saddle-back\" and \"double-ramp\" sabot was performed by the US Army Ballistics Research Laboratory during the development and improvement of modern 105mm and 120mm kinetic energy APFSDS penetrators(Drysdale 1978), permitted by the significant recent advancement in the computerized Finite element method in structural mechanics at that time; and now represents the existing fielded technology standard. (See for example the development of the M829 series of anti-tank projectiles beginning with the base model M829 in the early 1980s, to the recently fielded M829A4 model, employing ever longer \"double-ramp\" sabots). Upon muzzle exit, the sabot is discarded, and the smaller flight projectile flies to the target with less drag resistance than a full-bore projectile. In this manner, very high velocity and slender, low drag projectiles can be fired more efficiently, (see external ballistics and terminal ballistics). Nevertheless, the weight of the sabot represents parasitic mass that must also be accelerated to muzzle velocity, but does not contribute to the terminal ballistics of the flight projectile. For this reason, great emphasis is placed on selecting strong yet lightweight structural materials for the sabot, and configuring the sabot geometry to efficiently employ these parasitic materials at minimum weight penalty (Drysdale 1978).\n\nThe purpose of the sabot is to allow a smaller diameter flight projectile to be launched at greater muzzle velocity than if the flight projectile alone were fired from a gun of equal caliber (full-bore). Firing a smaller-sized projectile wrapped in a sabot raises the muzzle velocity of the projectile. Made of some lightweight material (usually high strength plastic in small caliber rifles, (see SLAP Saboted light armor penetrator), shotguns and muzzle loader ammunition; aluminium, steel, and carbon fiber reinforced plastic for modern anti-tank kinetic energy ammunition; and, in classic times, wood or papier-mâché – in muzzle loading cannons). The sabot usually consists of several longitudinal pieces held in place by the cartridge case, an obturator or driving band. When the projectile is fired, the sabot blocks the gas, provides significant structural support against launch acceleration, and carries the projectile down the barrel. When the sabot reaches the end of the barrel, the shock of hitting still air pulls the parts of the sabot away from the projectile, allowing the projectile to continue in flight. Modern sabots are made from high strength aluminum and graphite fiber reinforced epoxy. They are used primarily to fire long rods of very dense materials, such as tungsten heavy alloy and depleted uranium. (see for example the M829 series of anti-tank projectiles). \n\nSabot-type shotgun slugs were marketed in the United States starting in about 1985. When used with a rifled slug barrel, they offer vastly improved accuracy compared to traditional shotgun slugs. They are now legal for hunting in most U.S. states.\n\nA cup sabot supports the base and rear end of a projectile, and the cup material alone can provide both structural support and barrel obturation. When the sabot and projectile exit the muzzle of the gun, air pressure alone on the sabot forces the sabot to release the projectile. Cup sabots are found typically in small arms ammunition, smooth-bore shotgun and smooth-bore muzzleloader projectiles.\n\nUsed typically in rifled small arms (SLAP, shotguns and muzzleloaders), an expanding cup sabot has a one piece sabot surrounding the base and sides of a projectile, providing both structural support and obturation. Upon firing, when the sabot and projectile leave the muzzle of the gun, centrifugal force from the rotation of the projectile, due to barrel rifling, opens up the segments surrounding the projectile, rapidly presenting more surface area to air pressure, quickly releasing it.\n\nAlthough the use of cup sabots of various complexity are popular with rifle ammunition hand-loaders, in order to achieve significantly higher muzzle velocity with a lower drag, smaller diameter and lighter bullet, successful saboted projectile design has to include the resulting bullet stability characteristics. For example, simply inserting a commercially available 5.56mm (.224) bullet into a sabot that will fire it from a commercially available 7.62mm (.300) barrel may result in that 5.56mm bullet failing to achieve sufficient gyroscopic stability to fly accurately without tumbling. To achieve gyroscopic stability of longer bullets in smaller diameter requires faster rifling. Therefore, if a bullet requires at least 1 turn in 7 inch twist, (1:7 rifling), in 5.56mm, it will also require at least 1:7 rifling when saboted in 7.62mm. However, larger caliber commercial rifles generally don't need such fast twist rates; 1:10 being a readily available standard in 7.62mm. As a result, the twist rate of the larger barrel will dictate which smaller bullets can be fired with sufficient stability out of a sabot. In this example, using 1:10 rifling in 7.62mm restricts saboting to 5.56mm bullets that require 1:10 twist or slower, and this requirement will tend to restrict saboting to the shorter (and lighter) 5.56mm bullets.\n\nA base sabot has a one piece base which supports the bottom of the projectile, and separate pieces that surround the sides of the projectile and center it. The base sabot can have better and cleaner sabot/projectile separation than cup or expanding cup sabots for small arms ammunition, but may be more expensive to manufacture and assemble.\n\nIn larger caliber APDS ammunition, based on the cup, expanding cup, and base sabot concepts, significantly more complex assemblies are required. Reference 3 presents a cutaway of a modern 105mm APDS Armoured Piercing Discarding Sabot showing its numerous internal parts and sub-assemblies.\n\nA spindle sabot uses a set of at least two and upwards of four matched longitudinal rings or \"petals\" which have a center section in contact with a long arrow-type projectile; a front section or \"bore-rider\" which centers that projectile in the barrel and provides an air scoop to assist in sabot separation upon muzzle exit, and a rear section which both centers the projectile, provides a structural \"bulkhead\", and seals propellant gases with an obturator ring around the outside diameter. Spindle sabots are the standard type used in modern large caliber armor-piercing ammunition. Three-petal spindle-type sabots are shown in the illustrations at the right of this paragraph. The \"double-ramp\" and \"saddle-back\" sabots used on modern APFSDS ammunition are a form of spindle sabot (Drysdale 1978).\n\nShotgun slugs often use a cast plastic sabot similar to the spindle sabot. Shotgun sabots in general extend the full length of the projectile and are designed to be used more effectively in rifled barrels.\n\nA ring sabot uses the rear fins on a long rod projectile to help center the projectile and ride the bore, and the multi-petal sabot forms only a single bulkhead ring around the projectile near the front, with an obturator sealing gases from escaping past it, and centering the front of the projectile. The former Soviet Union favored armor-piercing sabot projectiles using ring sabots, which performed acceptably for that era, manufactured from high strength steel for both the long rod penetrator and ring sabot. The strength of the steel ring was sufficient to withstand launch accelerations without the need for sabot ramps to also support the steel flight projectile.\n\n\n"}

Here, signs and images do not faithfully show us reality, but might hint at the existence of something real which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.\n\nWhile the first-order simulacra is a faithful copy to the original and the third order are symbols that have become without referents, that is, symbols with no real object to represent but pretends to be a faithful copy of an original. Simply put, a third-order simulacra are symbols in themselves taken for reality and further layer of symbolism is added. This occurs when the symbol is taken to be more important or authoritative of the original entity, authenticity has been replaced by copy (thus reality is replaced by a substitute).\n\nThe consequence of the propagation of second-order simulacra is that, within the affected context, nothing is \"real,\" though those engaged in the illusion are incapable of seeing it. Instead of having experiences, people observe spectacles, via real or metaphorical control screens. Instead of the real, we have simulation and simulacra, the hyperreal.\n\nIn his essay \"The Precession of the Simulacra,\" Baudrillard recalls a tale from a short story by Borges in which a king requests a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical concept of map–territory relation. Baudrillard argues that in the postmodern epoch, the territory ceases to exist, and there is nothing left but the map; or indeed, the very concepts of the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.\n\nAmong the many issues associated with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become \"the silent majority,\" an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that moral universalism (human rights, equality) is equated with globalization, which is not concerned with immutable values but with mediums of exchange and equalisation such as the global market and mass media.\n\n\n"}

The Singaporean government and some Singaporeans alike heavily discourage the use of Singlish in favour of Standard English. The government has created an annual Speak Good English Movement to emphasise the point. Singlish is also heavily discouraged in the mass media and in schools. However, such official discouragement and routine censorship is actually countered by other presentations in mainstream media, including routine usage by ordinary people in street interviews broadcast on TV and radio on a daily basis, as well as occasional usage in newspapers.\n\nHowever, there have been recent surges in interest in Singlish usage, sparking several national conversations. In 2016, Oxford English Dictionary (OED) announced that it has added 19 new \"Singapore English\" items such as \"ang moh\", \"shiok\" and \"sabo\" in both its online and printed versions. Several Singlish words had previously made it into the OED's online version, which launched in March 2000. Words such as \"Lah\" and \"sinseh\" were already included in OED's debut, while \"kiasu\" made it into the online list in March 2007. Local celebrities were generally pleased for this Singaporean identity to be recognized on a global level.\n\nThe vocabulary of Singlish consists of words originating from English, Malay, Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Tamil and to a lesser extent various other European, Indic and Sinitic languages. Also, elements of American and Australian slang have come through from imported television series and films.\n\nSingapore English derives its roots from 146 years (1819–1965) of British colonial rule over Singapore. Prior to 1967 the standard form of English in Singapore had always been British English and Received Pronunciation. After Singapore declared independence in 1965, English in Singapore began to take a life of its own, leading to the development of modern-day Standard Singapore English. At the same time, Singlish evolved among the working classes who learned English without formal schooling.\n\nSinglish originated with the arrival of the British and the establishment of English language schools in Singapore. Soon, English filtered out of schools and onto the streets, to be picked up by non-English-speakers in a pidgin-like form for communication purposes. After some time, this new form of English, now loaded with substantial influences from Indian English, Baba, native Malay, and the southern varieties of Chinese, became the language of the streets and began to be learned as a first language in its own right. Creolization occurred, and Singlish is now a fully formed, stabilised, and independent English-based creole language.\n\nSinglish shares many linguistic similarities with Manglish of Malaysia, although a few distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary. Manglish generally now receives more Malay influence and Singlish more Chinese (Mandarin, Hokkien, etc.) influence.\nInitially, Singlish and Manglish were essentially the same dialect evolving from the British Malaya economy, born in the trading ports of Singapore, Malacca and Penang when Singapore and peninsular Malaysia were for many purposes a \"de facto\" single entity.\n\nIn Singapore, English was the language of administration, which the British used, with the assistance of English-educated Straits-born Chinese, to control the administration in Malaya and governance of trading routes such as the British East Indies spice routes with China, Japan, Europe and America in those ports and colonies of Singapore, Malacca and Penang through the colonial governing seat in Singapore.\n\nIn British Malaya, English was the language of the British administration, whilst Malay was spoken as the lingua franca of the streets, as the British did not wish to antagonise the native Malays.\n\nIn British Singapore, however, as the seat of the colonial government and international commerce, English was both the language of administration and the lingua franca.\n\nIn Malaya, the Chinese varieties themselves also contained many loan-words from Malay, and more Chinese loan-words from the Hokkien, rather than the Cantonese. For example, Hokkien-influenced \"pa sat\" instead of the Cantonese-influenced \"baa saak\" in Singapore (from Malay \"pasar\" meaning 'market'), \"loti\" (from Malay \"roti\" meaning 'bread'), Hokkien \"gu li\" and \"jam bban\" (from Malay \"guli\" meaning 'marble', and Malay 'jamban' meaning toilet).\n\nAfter Singapore's independence in 1965, and successive \"Speak Mandarin\" campaigns, a subtle language shift among the post-1965 generation became more and more evident as Malay idiomatic expressions were, and continued to be, displaced by idioms borrowed from Chinese spoken varieties, such as Hokkien.\n\nThe English language in Singapore is a sociolect continuum. The continuum runs through the following varieties:\n\nAcrolectal: Acrolectal Singaporean English exhibits an absence of or a much smaller degree of Singlish pronunciation features than do Mesolectal, Basilectal, and pidgin variants of Singlish. \n\nMesolectal: This is the most commonly spoken form of Singlish. It is a mix between Standard English and Singlish. At this level, a number of features not found in other forms of English begin to emerge.\n\nBasilectal: This is the most colloquial form of speech. Here, one can find all of the unique phonological, lexical, and grammatical features of Singlish. Many of these features can be attributed to Asian languages such as Chinese, Malay, or Indian languages such as Tamil, though some cannot. Both the basilect and mesolect are referred to as \"Singlish\".\n\nPidgin: This is the \"pidgin\" level of Singlish, which is probably a good representative of an earlier stage of Singlish, before creolisation took place and solidified Singlish as a fully formed creole. As with all pidgins, speakers at the pidgin level speak another language as a first language, and Singlish as a second language. However, since a substantial number of people today learn Singlish natively, the number of speakers at the \"pidgin\" level of Singlish is dwindling. This is because by definition, a pidgin is not learned natively.\n\nThe coexistence of basilectal Singlish and acrolectal Standard Singapore English can also be analysed as a diglossia, which is a split between a \"high\" formal language and a \"low\" informal language.\n\nThe Sociolect Continuum of Singaporean EnglishEach of the following means the same thing, but the basilectal and mesolectal versions incorporate some colloquial additions for illustrative purposes.\nSince many Singaporeans can speak English at multiple points along the sociolect spectrum, code-switching can occur very frequently between the acrolect (Standard Singapore English) and the mesolect (common Singlish). In addition, as many Singaporeans are also speakers of Chinese, Malay, or Indian languages such as Tamil, code-switching between English and other languages also occurs dynamically.\n\nFor example, a local Singaporean might speak in a Singlish consisting of English, Hokkien, Malay and Indian loan-words, when chatting with their friends.\n\nSinglish is commonly regarded with low prestige in Singapore. For this reason, Singlish is not used in formal communication. Standard Singapore English is preferred by many educated Singaporeans.\n\nDue to its origins, Singlish shares many similarities with pidgin varieties of English, and can easily give the impression of \"broken English\" or \"bad English\" to a speaker of some other, less divergent variety of English. In addition, the profusion of Singlish features, especially loanwords from Asian languages, mood particles, and topic-prominent structure, can easily make Singlish incomprehensible to a speaker of Standard English. As a result, the use of Singlish is greatly frowned on by the government, and two former prime ministers, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have publicly declared that Singlish is a substandard English that handicaps Singaporeans, presents an obstacle to learning proper English and renders the speaker incomprehensible to everyone except another Singlish speaker.\n\nCurrent prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has also said that Singlish should not be part of Singapore's identity. In the interests of promoting equality and better communication with the rest of the world, in 2000 the government launched the Speak Good English Movement to eradicate it, at least from formal usage. The Media Development Authority's free-to-air TV code states that the use of Singlish \"should not be encouraged and can only be permitted in interviews, where only the interviewee speaks Singlish.\" Despite this, in recent years the use of Singlish on television and radio has proliferated as localised Singlish continues to be popular among Singaporeans, especially in comedies, such as Phua Chu Kang.\n\nIn 2016, then Prime Minister Lee Hsieen Loong's press secretary wrote in a rebuttal to a New York Times opinion piece by Singaporean poet and literary critic Gwee Li Sui, to reinforce the government's policy against Singlish - Standard English continues to be viewed as vital for its citizens to earn a living and be understood by fellow English speakers. \n\nSinglish is strongly discouraged in Singaporean schools at a governmental level as it is believed to hinder the proper learning of Standard English, and so faces a situation of diglossia. The use of Singlish when speaking in classes or to teachers, however officially frowned upon, is rather inevitable given that many teachers themselves are comfortable with the variety.\n\nIn most workplaces, Singlish is avoided in formal settings, especially at job interviews, meetings with clients, presentations or meetings. Standard Singapore English is preferred. Nevertheless, select Singlish phrases are sometimes injected into discussions to build rapport or for a humorous effect, especially when the audience consists mainly of locals, but more recent Speak Good English campaigns are conducted with tacit acceptance of Singlish as a valid patois. \n\nIn informal settings, such as during conversation with friends, or transactions in kopi tiams and shopping malls, Singlish is used without restriction. For many students, using Singlish is inevitable when interacting with their peers, siblings, parents and elders.\n\nSingapore humour writer Sylvia Toh Paik Choo was the first to put a spelling and a punctuation to Singlish in her books \"Eh Goondu\" (1982) and \"Lagi Goondu\" (1986), which are essentially a glossary of Singlish, which she terms 'Pasar Patois'. This is later followed by publishing of a few other Singlish books including \"Coxford Singlish Dictionary\" (2002) by Colin Goh, \"An Essential Guide to Singlish\" (2003) by Miel and \"The Three Little Pigs Lah\" (2013) by Casey Chen, and \"Spiaking Singlish: A companion to how Singaporeans Communicate\" (2017) by Gwee Li Sui.\n\nIn recent times, Singlish is considered to be a fascinating language with its own systematic grammar. Linguists from universities around the world have referred to local productions to demonstrate to students how Singlish has become a unique variety of the English language. \n\nSinglish pronunciation, while built on a base of British English, is heavily influenced by Native Malay, Hokkien and Cantonese.\n\nThere are variations within Singlish, both geographically and ethnically. Chinese, Native Malays, Indians, Eurasians, and other ethnic groups in Singapore all have distinct accents.\n\nAll of these communities were formed by the earliest immigrants to Singapore and thus have been British subjects for three or more generations. Thus, they have received no other \"native education\" than solely British colonial education. Especially for those born before 1965, all the education received has been direct English rather than British influences. Many of the East Coast communities were descendants or in other ways, privileged to be granted British colonial education similar to those in Britain. As such the acrolectal standard of English does not diverge substantially from the acrolectal standard in Britain at this time, though (as in other colonial outposts) it always tended to be somewhat \"out of date\" compared with contemporary speech patterns in Britain.\n\nThe English-educated in Singapore received their English pedagogical instruction through missionary schools and convents such as the Anglo-Chinese School (ACS), Methodist Girls' School (MGS), Marymount Convent School, Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ), Canossa's Convent (Located in Aljunied). However, as decolonisation occurred, many expatriate English returned to Britain; Hence, in an unregulated socio-linguistic environment, the spontaneous varieties of a creolised English began to form after the 1960s.\n\nIn the East Coast, the teaching professions, especially teaching English, was a popular option in the European, Eurasian, Peranakan and Chinese communities who descended from privileged colonial Civil Service families for the Queen's Crown, from the beginning of the last century up till the 1970s. From the 1970s onwards, the permanent decolonisation meant that the original Queen's English taught began to experience deformation and modification from other languages. As a result, whole generations of school-children in the Siglap/Katong districts were taught English with an \"English-ed\", modified Queen's English accent minimally influenced by Eurasian, Peranakan and Hokkien Chinese intonation. Their Siglap/Katong accent, though not a pure form of Queen's English, is considered to be the prestigious variant of English in Singapore. Because that area has also tended to supply the ruling and civil service classes, many uneducated immigrant Chinese, Native Malay and Indian (new Tamil immigrants) who are trapped in the lower rungs of the social scale, often mock and ridicule this \"un-modern\" and \"foreign-sounding\" English. With the rise of the consumerist and mass middle-class, second-generation immigrants of humble origins have begun to deliberately deform taught acrolectal English for street pidgin patois as a form of identity-creation, self-actualisation and self-determination.\n\nProminent members of society still speak the acrolectal Queen's English in formal situations including Benjamin Sheares, David Marshall, Harry Lee Kuan Yew, Lee Siew Chow, Francis Seow and other affluent descendants of the East Coast communities.\n\nHowever, after 1965, with colonial attitudes being unpopular politically, a new \"culture-free\" English was promoted through the usages of television presenters in the former SBC (Singapore Broadcasting Corporation), through to its renaming as TCS (Television Corporation of Singapore) and to the current MediaCorp. This post-1965 accent is sometimes known as the \"Channel 5 accent\", so named after the English channel owned by the State media group. This gave rise to a new standard of artificially constructed but standardised acrolectal English for Singapore that did not equate to Received Pronunciation in Britain but corresponded to the latter's social function and status within the new Singaporean national context due to state monopoly, censorship and control over media in this early stage of Singaporean national politics. Despite this, the more affluent English-educated classes continued to support the original Christian missionary and Convent schools financially to stem the degradation of English language instruction. Despite all attempts, the English language in Singapore began to naturally creolise. The post-1965 English-educated accent is hence different from that of the pre-1965 \"English-ed accent\". For example, PM Lee Hsien Loong and Lee Hsien Yang, sons of the political figure Lee Kuan Yew, do not speak their father's Queen's English. The pure English diphthongs in words like \"home\", the liaison in pronunciation of \"r\" at the end of words ending with \"r\" followed by a word beginning with a vowel (such as \"ever emerging\", pronounced in Queen's English as \"eveR emerging\" does not occur. Instead, diphthongs are converted into simplified vowels, and elements of Chinese, Malay and other accents and influences begin to exert itself on the evolving acrolect.\n\nParallel to this, British economic, political and linguistic influence began to decline starkly throughout the world as colonies gained independence, such as India, while the United States of America rose as a superpower and American English largely took over as the international economic and cultural prestige variant. This change became more pervasive with the rise of Hollywood and American popular culture. As such, even among the \"English-educated classes\", the type and use of English shifted again as more affluent families, scholarship boards and charities sent the youth to boarding schools, colleges and universities in the United States over the United Kingdom. Many more Singaporeans then began to be born abroad to a jetsetting English-ed class and descendants of the ex-Civil Service class for left for higher-paying education, legal and corporate positions in the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom, and a huge middle-class segment to Australia and New Zealand. As such, the English-educated class born after 1965 do not speak the Queen's English any more, nor do they hold the \"Channel 5 accent\" as a standard, reverting between the prestige variant of the countries they received schooling in, and the bourgeois patois for familiarity. As such, the English accent in Singapore has become an international hybrid similar to that of affluent families in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei and Tokyo.\n\nWhen unemployment rose during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, Singlish came under official attack as undermining an economic competitiveness factor – English language fluency.\n\nThe consonants in Singlish are given below:\n\nIn general:\n\nBroadly speaking, there is a one-to-many mapping of Singlish vowel phonemes to British Received Pronunciation vowel phonemes, with a few exceptions (as discussed below, with regard to \"egg\" and \"peg\"). The following describes a typical system. There is generally no distinction between the non-close front monophthongs, so pet and pat are pronounced the same .\n\nAt the acrolectal level, the merged vowel phonemes are distinguished to some extent. These speakers may make a distinction between the tense vowels () and the lax vowels () respectively. For some speakers elements from American English are introduced, such as pre-consonantal [r] (pronouncing the \"r\" in bird, port, etc.). This is caused by the popularity of American TV programming. Current estimates are that about 20 per cent of university undergraduates sometimes use this American-style pre-consonantal [r] when reading a passage.\n\nMonophthongs\nDiphthongs\nVowel comparison between Singlish and :\n\nSinglish is semi-tonal as all words of Chinese origin retain their original tones in Singlish. On the other hand, original English words as well as words of Malay and Tamil origin are non-tonal.\n\nOne of the most prominent and noticeable features of Singlish is its unique intonation pattern, which is quite unlike British, American or Australian English, etc. For example:\n\nOverall, the differences between the different ethnic communities in Singapore are most evident in the patterns of intonation, so for example Malay Singaporeans often have the main pitch excursion later in an utterance than ethnically Chinese and Indian Singaporeans.\n\nGenerally, these pronunciation patterns are thought to have increased the clarity of Singlish communications between pidgin-level speakers in often noisy environments, and these features were retained in creolisation.\n\nThe grammar of Singlish has been heavily influenced by other languages in the region, such as Malay and Chinese, with some structures being identical to ones in Mandarin and other Chinese varieties. As a result, Singlish has acquired some unique features, especially at the basilectal level. Note that all of the features described below disappear at the acrolectal level, as people in formal situations tend to adjust their speech towards accepted norms found in other varieties of English.\n\nSinglish is topic-prominent, like Chinese and Japanese. This means that Singlish sentences often begin with a topic (or a known reference of the conversation), followed by a comment (or new information) Compared to other varieties of English, the semantic relationship between topic and comment is not important; moreover, nouns, verbs, adverbs, and even entire subject-verb-object phrases can all serve as the topic:\nThe above constructions can be translated analogously into Malay and Chinese, with little change to the word order.\n\nThe topic can be omitted when the context is clear, or shared between clauses. This results in constructions that appear to be missing a subject to a speaker of most other varieties of English, and so called PRO-drop utterances may be regarded as a diagnostic feature of Singapore Colloquial English (or 'Singlish'). For example:\n\nNouns are optionally marked for plurality. Articles are also optional. For example:\n\nIt is more common to mark the plural in the presence of a modifier that implies plurality, such as \"many\" or \"four\".\n\nMany nouns which seem logically to refer to a countable item are used in the plural, including furniture and clothing. Examples of this usage from corpus recordings are:\n\nThe copula, which is the verb \"to be\" in most varieties of English, is treated somewhat differently in Singlish:\n\nWhen occurring with an adjective or adjective phrase, the verb \"to be\" tends to be omitted:\n\nSometimes, an adverb such as \"very\" occurs, and this is reminiscent of Chinese usage of the word \"很\" (hen3) or \"好\" (hao3):\n\nIt is also common for the verb \"to be\" to be omitted before the present participle of the verb:\n\nSlightly less common is the dropping out of \"to be\" when used as an equative between two nouns, or as a locative:\n\nIn general, \"to be\" drops out more after nouns and pronouns (except \"I\", \"he\", and \"she\"), and much less after a clause (what I think is...) or a demonstrative (this is...).\n\nPast tense marking is optional in Singlish. Marking of the past tense occurs most often in irregular verbs, as well as verbs where the past tense suffix is pronounced . For example:\n\nDue to consonant cluster simplification, the past tense is most often unmarked when it is pronounced as /t/ or /d/ at the end of a consonant cluster:\n\nThe past tense is more likely to be marked if the verb describes an isolated event (it is a punctual verb), and it tends to be unmarked if the verb in question represents an action that goes on for an extended period:\n\nThere seems also to be a tendency to avoid use of the past tense to refer to someone who is still alive:\n\nNote in the final example that although the speaker is narrating a story, she probably uses the present tense in the belief that the tour guide is probably still alive.—\n\nInstead of the past tense, a change of state can be expressed by adding \"already\" or \"liao\" () to the end of the sentence, analogous to Chinese 了 (\"le\"). This is not the same as the past tense, but more of an aspect, as it does not cover past habitual or continuous occurrences, and it refers to a real or hypothetical change of state in the past, present or future.\n\nThe frequent use of already (pronounced more like \"oreddy\" and sometimes spelt that way) in Singapore English is probably a direct influence of the Hokkien \"liao\" particle. For example:\n\nSome examples of the direct use of the Hokkien particle are:\n\nNegation works in general like English, with not added after \"to be\", \"to have\", or modals, and don't before all other verbs. Contractions (can't, shouldn't) are used alongside their uncontracted forms.\n\nHowever, due to final cluster simplification, the -t drops out from negative forms, and -n may also drop out after nasalising the previous vowel. This makes nasalisation the only mark of the negative.\n\nAnother effect of this is that in the verb \"can\", its positive and negative forms are distinguished only by vowel:\n\nAlso, never is used as a negative past tense marker, and does not have to carry the English meaning. In this construction, the negated verb is never put into the past-tense form:\n\nIn addition to the usual way of forming yes-no questions, Singlish uses two more constructions:\n\nIn a construction similar (but not identical) to Chinese A-not-A, or not is appended to the end of sentences to form yes/no questions. \"Or not\" cannot be used with sentences already in the negative:\n\nThe phrase is it, appended to the end of sentences, forms yes-no questions. It is generic like the French\" n'est-ce pas?\" (\"isn't it so?\"), regardless of the actual verb in the sentence, and is strongly reminiscent of the Chinese \"是吗\" (shi4 ma) as well as of its frequent use amongst South Indian speakers of English. Is it implies that the speaker is simply confirming something he/she has already inferred:\n\nThe phrase isn't it also occurs when the speaker thinks the hearer might disagree with the assertion.\n\nThere are also many discourse particles (such as hah, hor, meh, and ar) used in questions. (See the \"Discourse particles\" section elsewhere in this article.)\n\nAnother feature strongly reminiscent of Chinese and Malay, verbs are often repeated (e.g., TV personality Phua Chu Kang's \"don't pray-pray!\" pray = play). In general verbs are repeated twice to indicate the delimitative aspect (that the action goes on for a short period), and three times to indicate greater length and continuity:\n\nThe use of verb repetition also serves to provide a more vivid description of an activity:\n\nIn another usage reminiscent of Chinese, nouns referring to people can be repeated for intimacy. Most commonly, monosyllabic nouns are repeated:\n\nHowever, occasionally reduplication is also found with bisyllabic nouns:\n\nAdjectives of one or two syllables can also be repeated for intensification:\n\nDue to the frequent use of these repetitions on short words, Singlish expressions often sound to speakers of American or British English as if they are spoken by children, which non-Singlish speakers find quite amusing, and contributes to the impression of Singlish as an informal and sometimes intimate language.\n\nParticles in Singlish are highly comparable to Chinese. In general, discourse particles, also known as \"tags\" occur at the end of a sentence. Their presence changes the meaning or the tone of the sentence, but not its grammatical meaning.\n\nParticles are noted for keeping their tones regardless of the remainder of the sentence. Most of the particles are directly borrowed from southern Chinese varieties, with the tones intact.\n\nResearch on Singlish discourse particles have been many but varied, often focusing on analysing their functions in the sentences they appear in.\n\nWah Lau / Walao\n\n\"Wah lau\" is derived from a Hokkien or Teochew phrase that means \"my father\". It is used as an interjection or exclamation at the beginning of a sentence, and it usually has a negative connotation. \n\n\"Kena\" can be used as an auxiliary to mark the passive voice in some varieties of Singlish.\n\nIt is derived from a Malay word that means \"to encounter or to come into physical contact\", and is only used with objects that have a negative effect or connotation. Verbs after \"kena\" may appear in the infinitive form (i.e. without tense) or as a past participle. It is similar in meaning to passive markers in Chinese, such as Hokkien \"tio\" or Mandarin 被 \"bèi\":\n\nKena is not used with positive things:\n\nUse of kena as in the above examples will not be understood, and may even be greeted with a confused reply: \"But strike lottery good wat!\" (But it's a good thing to win the lottery!).\n\nIt may be used in vulgar, obscene and offensive contexts, such as:\n\nHowever, when used in sarcasm, kena can be used in apparently positive circumstances, though this is considered grammatically incorrect by the true natives of Singapore. It is mostly incorrectly used by European expatriates or Hong Kong and Mainlanders trying to integrate and assimilate into Singapore society, though with an ironic modicum of success, for example:\n\nWhen the context is given, \"Kena\" may be used without a verb, similar to the colloquial-English construction \"I am/you're/he is going to get it.\"\n\nUsing another auxiliary verb with \"kena\" is perfectly acceptable as well:\n\nSome examples of Singlish phrases with \"Kena\":\n\nThe word may be phonetically mispronounced \"kana\" by most non-Malays, especially by those of the Chinese tongue. Informal Malay may socio-linguistically dictate it be pronounced as \"kene\" (as in \"kernel\" without the \"r\" and \"l\"), while the word itself in reality has two different meanings; \"to have (to) encounter(ed) something\" as how it is explained above or \"to have to (do something)\":\n\n\"Kau kena angkat ni.\" – \"You have to carry this.\"<br>\n\"Joe kena marah tadi.\" – \"Joe just got scolded.\"\n\nSinglish, however, is only influenced by the latter application of the word.\n\n\"Tio\" can be used interchangeably with \"kena\" in many scenarios. While \"kena\" is often used in negative situations, \"tio\" can be used in both positive and negative situations.\n\n\"Tio\" has a lighter negative tone when used negatively, compared to \"kena\".\n\nBoth mean the same, but \"kena\" makes the speaker sound more unhappy with the situation than \"tio\".\n\n\"Tio\" also sounds more sympathetic when talking about an unfortunate incident about someone close.\n\nUsing \"kena\" in the following might not be appropriate, as they seem impolite, as if the speaker is mocking the victim.\n\nThe word \"one\" is used to emphasise the predicate of the sentence by implying that it is unique and characteristic. It is analogous to the use of particles like 嘅 (ge) or 架 (ga) in Cantonese, 啲 (e) in Hokkien, (-wa) in spoken Japanese, or 的 (de) in some varieties of Mandarin. \"One\" used in this way does not correspond to any use of the word \"one\" in British, American English, Australian English, etc.: It can be compared to the British usage of 'eh'. It might also be analysed as a relative pronoun, though it occurs at the end of the relative clause instead of the beginning (as in Standard English)\n\nFor speakers of Mandarin, 的 (de) can also be used in place of \"one\".\n\nThe word then is often pronounced or written as den . When used, it represents different meanings in different contexts. In this section, the word is referred to as den.\n\ni) \"Den\" can be synonymous with \"so\" or \"therefore\". It is used to replace the Chinese grammatical particle, 才 (see ii).\n\nWhen it is intended to carry the meaning of \"therefore\", it is often used to explain one's blunder/negative consequences. In such contexts, it is a translation from Chinese \"所以\". When used in this context, the \"den\" is prolonged twice the usual length in emphasis, as opposed to the short emphasis it is given when used to mean cai2.\n– \"I did not do my homework, that's why (therefore) I got a scolding\"\n– \"I did not do my homework; I got a scolding after that\"\n– \"It is only due to the fact that I did not do my homework that I was scolded.\"\n\nBe very careful because \"den\" cannot be freely interchanged with \"so\". It will sound grammatically erroneous when employed inappropriately. This is because the grammatical rules in English do not correspond to the grammatical rules in Chinese on a one-for-one basis.\n\nThe following examples are inappropriate use of \"den\", which will immediately sound grammatically illogical to a Singlish speaker: \n\nThe reason for this is that \"den\" often marks a negative, non-volitional outcome (either in the future or the past), while the above sentences express volition and are set in the present. Consider the following examples:\n\nii) \"Den\" is also used to describe an action that will be performed later. It is used to replace the Chinese particle, \"才\". When used in this context, the den is pronounced in one beat, instead of being lengthened to two beats as in (i).\n\nIf shortened, the meaning will be changed / incorrectly conveyed. For example, \"I go home liao, \"den\" (2 beats) call you\" will imbue the subtext with a questionable sense of irony, a lasciviousness for seduction (3 beats), or just general inappropriateness (random 2 beats indicating a Hong Kong comedy-influenced moleitou 無理頭 Singaporean sense of humour).\n\niii) \"Den\" can used at the beginning of a sentence as a link to the previous sentence. In this usage, \"den\" is used to replace the Mandarin grammatical particle which is approximately equivalent in meaning (but not in grammatical usage) only to \"then,\" or \"然后\" (ran2 hou4), as in \"ran2hou4 hor\". In such cases, it often carries a connotation of an exclamation.\n\nWhen used in this context, in formal Singlish, the particle is lengthened to 2 beats to indicate replacement of \"ran2hou4\" or 1 beat when used in conjunction with \"hor\" as in \"den hor\".\n\nIt can also be shortened to 1 beat if the other speaker is a fluent Singapore speaker of Singlish (who tends to speak fast and can deduce via contextual clues which form of meaning the use of den is taking on), but the Singlish variant used when spoken to a wider Southeast Asian audience, is lengthening of the word to 2 beats.\n\nThe subtle usage of these particles differentiates a Malaysian speaking Manglish trying to assimilate into society, and a true-blue native-born Singaporean (whether it's a Chinese, Indian, Eurasian, Malay or Caucasian speaker of Singlish). In many cases, a mixed child born and bred in Singapore will speak a more subtle form of Singlish (together with the influence of another language such as Dutch, Swedish, German) than a first-generation Malaysian of Chinese descent assimilating into Singapore.\n\niv) \"Den\" can be used to return an insult/negative comment back to the originator. When used in such a way, there must first be an insult/negative comment from another party. In such contexts, it is a translation from Chinese \"才\".\n\nv) \"Den?\" can be used as a single-worded phrase. Even if \"den\" is used in a single-worded phrase, even with the same pronunciation, it can represent 4 different meanings. It can either be synonymous with \"so what?\", or it can be a sarcastic expression that the other party is making a statement that arose from his/her actions, or similarly an arrogant expression which indicating that the other party is stating the obvious, or it can be used as a short form for \"what happened then?\".\n\n[Synonymous with \"so what?\"]\n\n[Sarcastic expression] Speakers tend to emphasise the pronunciation of 'n'.\n\"Context: A is supposed to meet B before meeting a larger group but A is late for the first meeting\"\n\n[Arrogant expression] Speakers have the option of using \"Den\" in a phrase, as in \"Ah Bu Den\" or \"Ah Den\". In this case it serves approximately the same purpose as 'duh' in American English slang.\n\n[Ah, but then? (What happened after that?)]\n\nvi) \"Den\" can also indicate a conditional (an if-then condition), implying an omitted \"if\"/\"when\":\n\nOi originating from the Hokkien (喂,oe), is commonly used in Singlish, as in other English varieties, to draw attention or to express surprise or indignation. Some examples of the usage of \"Oi\" include:\n\nAs \"Oi\" has connotations of disapproval, it is considered to be slightly offensive if it is used in situations where a more polite register is expected, e.g. while speaking to strangers in public, people in the workplace or one's elders.\n\nThe ubiquitous word lah ( or ), sometimes spelled as la and rarely spelled as larh, luh or lurh, is used at the end of a sentence. It originates from the Hokkien word (, POJ: \"lah\") used by Chinese people when they speak Singlish, although its usage in Singapore is also been rarely influenced by its occurrence in Malay. It simultaneously softens the force of an utterance and entices solidarity, though it can also have the opposite meaning so it is used to signal power. In addition, there are suggestions that there is more than one lah particle, so there may be a stressed and an unstressed variant and perhaps as many as nine tonal variants, all having a special pragmatic function\n\nNote that 'lah' is occasionally after a comma for clarity, though true locals never bother with punctuation, because there is never a pause before 'lah'. This is because in Malay, 'lah' is appended to the end of the word and is not a separate word by itself. It must also be noted that although 'lah' is usually spelled in the Malay fashion, its use is more akin to the Hokkien use. It is not related to 'la', found in the Scouse dialect in Liverpool, England, which is short for 'lad'.\n\nIn Malay, 'lah' is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone, particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite. To drink is \"minum\", but 'Here, drink!' is \"minumlah!\". Similarly, 'lah' is frequently used with imperatives in Singlish:\n\n'Lah' also occurs frequently with \"Yah\" and \"No\" (hence \"Yah lah!\" and \"No lah!...\"). This can, with the appropriate tone, result in a less-brusque declaration and facilitate the flow of conversation. \"No more work to do, we go home lah!\" However, if the preceding clause is already diminutive or jocular, suffixing it with -lah would be redundant and improper: one would not say \"yep lah\", \"nope lah\", or \"ta lah\" (as in the British \"Ta\" for \"thank you\").\n\n\"Lah\" is often used with brusque, short, negative responses:\n\n\"Lah\" is also used for reassurance:\n\n\"Lah\" is sometimes used to curse people\n\n\"Lah\" can also be used to emphasise items in a spoken list, appearing after each item in the list.\n\nAlthough \"lah\" can appear nearly anywhere, it does not appear with a yes-no question. Other particles are used instead:\n\nThe particle wat (), also spelled what, is used to remind or contradict the listener, especially when strengthening another assertion that follows from the current one:\n\nIt can also be used to strengthen any assertion:\n\nThis usage is noticeably characterised by a low tone on wat, and parallels the assertive Mandarin particle 嘛 in expressions like \"不错嘛\".\n\nMah (), originating from both Hokkien and Cantonese (嘛, \"ma\"), is used to assert that something is obvious and final, and is usually used only with statements that are already patently true. It is often used to correct or cajole, and in some contexts is similar to English's \"duh\". This may seem condescending to the listener:\n\nLor (), also spelled lorh or loh, from Hokkien (啰, \"lor\"), is a casual, sometimes jocular way to assert upon the listener either direct observations or obvious inferences. It also carries a sense of resignation, or alternatively, dismissiveness. that \"it happens this way and can't be helped\":\n\nLeh (), from Hokkien (leh 咧), is used to soften a command, request, claim, or complaint that may be brusque otherwise:\n\nEspecially when on a low tone, it can be used to show the speaker's disapproval:\n\nHor (), from Hokkien (乎 honn), also spelled horh, is used to ask for the listener's attention and consent/support/agreement: It is usually pronounced with a low tone.\n\nAr (), also spelled arh or ah, is inserted between topic and comment. It often gives a negative tone:\n\nAr () with a rising tone is used to reiterate a rhetorical question:\n\nAr () with a mid-level tone, on the other hand, is used to mark a genuine question that does require a response: ('or not' can also be used in this context.)\n\nHah (), also spelled har, originating from the British English word huh or Hokkien (hannh 唅), is used to express disbelief, shock or used in a questioning manner.\n\nMeh (), from Cantonese (咩, \"meh\"), is used to form questions expressing surprise or scepticism:\n\nSiol is not a vulgar word. It is an adaptation of the word \"Siul\" (which means whistles). Often misunderstood as the word \"Sial\", Siol has no meaning at all (least if it's spelt Siul.) Siol is used to avoid using the word \"Sial\", which is a vulgarity and not acceptable in speech among most Malay families, and can be compared to the word \"fuck\". Sial is considered extremely rude if applied as a \"sentence enhancer\". To avoid getting \"back-hand\" (slapped across the face) by the elders between the families, the word \"Siol\" was created.\n\nExample,\n\nUsing \"Sial\" - while having family dinner at home, a seven-year-old child says to his/her mother, \n\"Apa \"sial\" Mak bebual?\" - \"What the fuck are you talking about, mom?\"- risk of getting 'back-hand' from parents is highest.\n\nUsing Siol - same scenario as above,\n\"Apa Siol Mak bebual?\" - \"What the whistle are you talking about, mom?\" - risk of punishment from parents is lowest.\n\n, also spelled sia or siah, is used to express envy or emphasis. It is a derivative of the Malay vulgar word \"sial\" (derivative of the parent, used interchangeably but sometimes may imply a stronger emphasis). Originally, it is often used by Malay peers in informal speech between them, sometimes while enraged, and other times having different implications depending on the subject matter:\n\n\"Kau ade problem ke ape, \"sial\"?\" – \"Do you have a problem or what?\" (negative, enraged)<br>\n\"\"Sial\" ah, Joe bawak iPad ni ari.\" – \"Whoa, Joe brought an iPad today.\" (positive, envy)<br>\n\"Takde lah \"sial\".\" – \"No way, man.\" or \"I don't have it, man.\" (positive, neutral)<br>\n\"Joe kene marah \"sial\".\" – \"Joe got scolded, man.\" (positive, emphasis)\n\nMalays may also pronounce it without the \"l\", not following the \"ia\" but rather a nasal \"aah\". This particular form of usage is often seen in expressing emphasis. There is a further third application of it, in that a \"k\" is added at the end when it will then be pronounced \"saak\" with the same nasal quality only when ending the word. It is similarly used in emphasis.\n\nHowever, Singlish itself takes influence only from the general expression of the term without any negative implication, and non-Malay speakers (or Malays speaking to non-Malays) pronounce it either as a nasal \"sia\" or simply \"siah\":\n\n/sâi/\nAlso from Hokkien, it literally means excrement. This is also used in \"\"kena sai\", which means to be humiliated (see earlier part of this section for the definition of \"kena\"\").\n\n/siâo/\nderived from Hokkien\nSiao is a common word in Singlish. Literally, it means crazy.\n\nSummary of discourse and other particles:\n\nNia is originated from Hokkien which means 'only', mostly used to play down something that has been overestimated.\n\n\"Then you know\" is a phrase often used at the end of a sentence or after a warning of the possible negative consequences of an action. Can be directly translated as \"and you will regret not heeding my advice\". Also a direct translation of the Chinese '你才知道'.\n\nAiyyo (also spelled aiyo): A state of surprise. Originally from Chinese \"哎哟\".\n\n\"There is\"/\"there are\" and \"has\"/\"have\" are both expressed using got, so that sentences can be translated in either way back into British / American / Australasian English. This is equivalent to the Chinese 有 \"yǒu\" (to have):\n\nCan is used extensively as both a question particle and an answer particle. The negative is \"cannot\".\n\n\"Can\" can be repeated for greater emphasis or to express enthusiasm:\n\nThe Malay word with the same meaning boleh can be used in place of \"can\" to add a greater sense of multiculturalism in the conversation. The person in a dominant position may prefer to use \"boleh\" instead:\n\nThe phrase like that is commonly appended to the end of the sentence to emphasise descriptions by adding vividness and continuousness. Due to its frequency of use, it is often pronounced lidat (lye-dat):\n\"Like that\" can also be used as in other Englishes:\n\nIn British English, \"also\" is used before the predicate, while \"too\" is used after the predicative at the end of the sentence. In Singlish (also in American and Australian English), \"also\" (pronounced oso, see phonology section above) can be used in either position.\n\n\"Also\" is also used as a conjunction. In this case, \"A also B\" corresponds to \"B although A\". This stems from Chinese, where the words 也 (yě), 还 (hái) or 都 (dōu) (meaning also, though usage depends on dialect or context) would be used to express these sentences.\n\nThe order of the verb and the subject in an indirect question is the same as a direct question.\n\n\"Ownself\" is often used in place of \"yourself\", or more accurately, \"yourself\" being an individual, in a state of being alone.\n\nNot all expressions with the \"-self\" pronouns should be taken literally, but as the omission of \"by\":\n\nSome people have begun to add extra \"ed\"s to the past tense of words or to pronounce \"ed\" separately, sometimes in a form of exaggeration of the past tense. Most of the time, the user uses it intentionally to mock proper English.\n\nSinglish formally takes after British English (in terms of spelling and abbreviations), although naming conventions are in a mix of American and British ones (with American ones on the rise). For instance, local media have \"sports pages\" (sport in British English) and \"soccer coverage\" (the use of the word \"soccer\" is not common in British media), though the word \"football\" is also taken to be synonymous with \"soccer\" in Singapore.\n\nSinglish also uses many words borrowed from Hokkien, and from Malay. The most well-known instance of a borrowing from Hokkien is 'kiasu', which means \"frightened of losing out\", and is used to indicate behaviour such as queueing overnight to obtain something; and the most common borrowing from Malay is 'makan', meaning \"to eat\".\n\nIn many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. This is most obvious in such cases as \"borrow\"/\"lend\", which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Hokkien word, \"借\" (chio), which can mean to lend or to borrow. (\"Oi (also used as oy, although Singaporeans spell it as oi), can borrow me your calculator?\"); and 'send' can be used to mean \"accompany someone\", as in \"Let me send you to the airport\", possibly under the influence of the Hokkien word \"送\" (sang). However, the Malay '(meng)hantar' can also be used to mean both \"send a letter\" and \"take children to school\", so perhaps both Malay and Chinese have combined to influence the usage of 'send' in Singapore.\n\n\n\n"}

Initially associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church, he later joined the Open Brethren, and is remembered now as a pioneer of the Kerala Brethren movement.\n\nVolbrecht Nagel was born on 3 November 1867 in Florstadt-Stammheim (belonging to the German federal state of Hesse). He grew up in a religious family, but lost his parents at a young age. At the age of 18, Nagel claimed to have been born again after hearing the gospel from a cobbler turned itinerant preacher. With a desire to be a missionary, he moved to Basel, Switzerland, joined the Basel Mission Training Institute in 1886 and graduated in 1892. He was ordained in the Evangelical Lutheran Mission in 1893.\n\nNagel came to Cannanore on the Malabar Coast as a Reverend in December 1893. He became the head of the Basel Mission center in Vaniankulam. The burden of running the schools and the small-scale industries of the Basel Mission in Vaniankulam became a stumbling block in his goal of independent ministry. In 1896, he left the Lutheran Church and Vaniankulam and went south without an aim. On his trip, he saw a prayer center in Kunnamkulam and met Paramel Itoop, a new believer. He decided to start his work at Kunnamkulam, an ancient bastion of Christianity in India.\n\nTo be part of the local community, he learned Malayalam. The community in Kunnamkulam received him as one of their own, as he wrote and spoke in Malayalam. In April 1897, he married Harriet Mitchell, an Anglo-Indian who was a teacher at Kunnamkulam. They had five sons and two daughters. One son and one daughter died in early childhood. Harriet Nagel died on 27 January 1935.\n\nA few months after their marriage, they went to the Nilgiris and met the English Open Brethren Missionary Handley Bird. The following June, Nagel was baptized by immersion by Bird at Coimbatore. In 1906, he started an orphanage and a home for widows at Nellikunnu near Thrissur City named Rehoboth, which still stands today.\n\nIn 1914, Nagel traveled back to his native Germany. His plan was to send his older children to England for education and return to India in six months, but the beginning of World War I prevented his return. As a national of the German Empire, he could not enter British-administered Malabar, so he moved to Switzerland. Harriet and three children were back in Malabar Coast, while the two older children were in England. The letter he sent to the assembly fellowship in Paravur in 1917 reflects the hunger in his heart for souls in Malabar. That letter contained the following words: \"“My sweetest treasures are in India. My heart belongs there\".\" But his desire was not fulfilled. He suffered from palsy and became bedridden. While teaching at Wiedenest Bible School, Nagel had a stroke and died on 12 May 1921 and was buried there. Harriet had been able to reach Germany and take care of him.\n\nIn 1898, Nagel wrote a book called \"Christian Baptism\". He wrote many songs and hymns in Malayalam that are sung even today by all Christian denominations. Nagel is regarded with great esteem by the Malayalee Christian community for all his work in bringing the Gospel to Kerala.\n\nNagel's mother tongue was German. He became fluent in Malayalam and composed hymns in that language, which are still used in church services.\n\nA few of the hymns in Malayalam and their translations in English are given below:\n\nHis translations include:\n\n\n"}
