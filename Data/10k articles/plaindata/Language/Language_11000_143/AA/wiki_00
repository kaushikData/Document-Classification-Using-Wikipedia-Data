Dakshinamurthy (born 10 April 1938 in Neduvakkottai, Mannargudi Taluk, Thiruvarur district, Tamil Nadu, India) is \nan eminent Tamil scholar, writer, and an English translator of classical, medieval and modern Tamil literature. He is a pioneer in the field of translation of Classical Tamil works. He is best known for his complete and faithful English translations of 19 ancient classical Tamil literature for the very first time in history between the period of 1999-2012. The Government of India honored him with the Presidential Award for lifetime achievement in Classical Tamil, 'The Tolkappiyar Award' for the year 2015.\n\nDr. A. Dakshinamurthy became interested in Tamil studies under Tamil luminaries such as Dr.T.P. Meenakshisundaran and Mahavidwan S. Dhandapani Desikar. \n\nHe started his career in 1962 at V. S. Boys High school, Thiruvarur. Since then, he has served in many institutions like the A. V. C College, Mayiladuthurai, A. V. V. M Sri Pushpam college, Poondi and the Madurai Tamil Sangam, Madurai. He currently lives in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.\n\nHis first publication was a scholarly book in the Tamil language entitled, \"Tamilar Nagarikamum Panpadum\" (). It pointed out all aspects of Tamil culture, civilization and development from the ancient Sangam period to the contemporary age. The work has remained popular since its publication in 1973 and has been reprinted several times.\n\nHis Ph. D dissertation \"'Sanga Ilakkiyangal Unarthum Manitha Uravugal'(1997)\", which was published as a book in 2001 deals elaborately with all the kinships between men and women, rulers and the ruled, parents and children, masters and servants, crowned kings and the chiefs, patrons and bards including poets, individuals and the society, based on cultural anthropology.\n\nHis first translation work, \"The Poems of Bharathidasan – A Translation\", was recognized and honored by the government of Tamil Nadu during the centenary celebrations of the poet in 1991 and inspired him to start working in the field of translation. His first major translation work was the Sangam literature Akananuru in 1999, which is the first full translation of all the 400 poems of the literature.\n\nHis translation of the Sangam anthology Natrinai (2001), is the first faithful translation of the classic. He gave the second complete translation of the Sangam work Kuruntokai in 2007, after 31 years since the first work by the duo \"M. Shanmugham Pillai\" and \"David Luden\" appeared in 1976. He gave the second complete translation of all the ten books belonging to the Pattuppaattu collection in 2012, after a wide gap of 66 years since the first translation by J. V. Chellaih appeared in 1946. Six books from the Patinenkilkanakku division published in 2010, are the first and the only complete translations of the classics available. \n\nHe has written several scholarly research articles on language, literature, history, culture, place names, personal names and the art of translation. He has established in his research that among the early Tamil society, cross cousin marriage was the order and love between a girl and a boy drawn from two different geographical regions was not treated in the Sangam classics; he has proved that the word “நும் (Num)” was derived from “நிம் (Nim)”, an idea which is in contrast to Tholkappiyam which says \"நும் (Num)\" is the source for the word “நீயிர் (Neeyir)”; he has established that the one lettered words, ‘ஆ (Aa), மா (Maa), பா (Paa), நீ (Nee), etc., were once two lettered and in course of time had lost the final nasal consonant which are a few noteworthy findings.\n\nHaving served as a teacher for 33 years in various institutions in Tamil Nadu, he retired in 1996 as the principal of the Senthamizh Arts College, Madurai Tamil Sangam, Madurai.\n\n\n\"Akananuru – The Akam four hundred\" published in three volumes by the Bharathidasan University, Thiruchirappalli,1999, (first complete translation of Akananuru).\n\n\"The Narrinai Four Hundred\", International Institute of Tamil Studies, Chennai, 2001.\n\n“Kurunthokai – An Anthology of Classical Tamil Poetry”, a complete translation of Kurunthokai, Vetrichelvi Publishers, Thanjavur, 2007.\n\n“Patinenkilkkanakku – Works on the Akam Theme”, a translation of 6 books from the Patinenkilkanakku collection, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirapalli, 2010.\n\n\"Ancient Tamil Classic Pattuppattu In English (The Ten Tamil Idylls)\", Thamizh Academy SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulattur, 2013.\n\n\nHe is one of the very few scholars who have contributed to the propagation of Bharathidasan's works through translation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

North Carolina", "text": "American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina v. North Carolina\n\nACLU of N.C. & Syidah Mateen v. State of North Carolina is a court case in the state of North Carolina within the United States of America. One of the main plaintiffs was Syidah Mateen an American-Muslim of Greensboro, North Carolina. She and the North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union called for the state courts of North Carolina to rule that it is acceptable under the laws of the state for non-Christians to swear on religious texts of their own faith rather than the Bible of Christianity.\n\nIn 2003 Syidah Mateen (a computer analyst for radiology clinics, born in 1964) was a witness set to testify in a domestic violence protective order hearing, before Guilford District Judge Tom Jarrell. When asked to swear on a King James Version of the Bible, Mateen, a lifelong Muslim, asked \"Do you have a Qur'an available?\" Matten recalled later that she \"was actually shocked that they didn't have any\". \n\nNorth Carolina's state law \"allows witnesses preparing to testify in court to take their oath in three ways: by laying a hand over 'the Holy Scriptures', by saying 'so help me God' without the use of a religious book, or by an affirmation using no religious symbols\". \n\nWhen told that there was no Qur'an in the courthouse Mateen's testimony was allowed after she agreed to affirm that she would be truthful.\n\nWhile Mateen claims that Judge Jarrell told her that \"all the courtrooms needed copies of the Quran\", Jarrell maintains he told her only that \"he would look into the legality of such oaths if she wanted to bring a Quran in the future\".\n\nMateen's parents had converted to Islam in the early 1960s while living in Flint, Michigan. After moving to North Carolina, her father, L'Fatihah Mateen, established the Al-Ummil Ummat Islamic Center in Greensboro and served as its prayer leader (he died in 1997). In 2005 Syidah Mateen, not realizing that the lack of a Qur'an for oaths at the courthouse might be mandated by law, joined with other Muslim-American's at the Al-Ummil Ummat Islamic Center \"to donate copies of the Qur'an to Guilford County's two courthouses\". The Center's imam, Charles Abdullah \"working through a judicial assistant, was prepared to hand over the Qurans\", but two Guilford judges declined to accept the texts, saying \"an oath on the Qur'an is not a legal oath under state law\".\nIn Raleigh, the lawyer for North Carolina's Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) issued a preliminary opinion that said \"that state law allows people to be sworn in using a Quran rather than a Bible\". This was refuted by Guilford County's Senior Resident Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright who sets policy for the county's nine Superior Court courtrooms. Judge Albright stated flatly \"An oath on the Quran is not a lawful oath under our law.\" He maintained that the statute means the Bible and that if that is to be changed it is up to the North Carolina Legislature, \"It's gotten way out there: They've got everything from the Book of Mormon to the Book of Wicca on the list. Our position is that the statute governs not only the type of oath, but the manner and administration of the oath, and that it's now a legislative matter to straighten out.\" \n\nGuilford Chief District Judge Joseph E. Turner \"told [Imam] Abdullah that he could not accept the Qurans for the courtrooms\". After the Judges' statements the AOC's spokesman Dick Ellis said \"We are not aware of any courtroom that has ever allowed anybody to swear on anything but the Bible.\" Judge Jarrell the presiding officer in the case where Mateen testified did not make any comment but \"deferred any decision to the judges that set courtroom policy\". Judge Turner did ask Imam Abdullah to \"donate a copy of the Quran to the law libraries in the county's two courthouses\" which the imam did. \n\nIn an interview with reporters on the matter Mateen stated \"This is a diverse world, and everybody does not worship or believe the same. We'll just have to get in touch with the right people and determine our next move.\" It was added that Mateen \"worries that people might consider her testimony less credible if they see her unwilling to swear on a holy text\".\n\nNorth Carolina's oath-taking practices \"date to 1777 but have evolved over the years\". North Carolina's legislature first passed the oath-taking statutes in 1777. At that time, the title of the statute was \"Administration of oath upon the Gospels\". In 1985 the word \"Gospels\" was replaced by the term \"Holy Scriptures\". \n\nCurrently the North Carolina General statute on oath taking (§11-2) states: (emphasis added) \"Judges and other persons who may be empowered to administer oaths, shall (except in the cases in this Chapter excepted) require the party to be sworn to lay his hand upon the Holy Scriptures, in token of his engagement to speak the truth and in further token that, if he should swerve from the truth, he may be justly deprived of all the blessings of the holy book and made liable to that vengeance which he has imprecated on his own head.\"\n\nPrior to 1985 amendments to N.C.G.S. § 11-2, the statutory section read that Judges shall \"require the party sworn to lay his hand upon the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God\".\n\nWhen it was announced that the Qur'an was not to be allowed for swearing before testimony, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) issued a press statement, \"By stating that only one book qualifies as 'Holy Scriptures', the court may be making an inappropriate endorsement of a single set of religious beliefs. Eliminating the opportunity to swear an oath on one's own holy text may also have the effect of diminishing the credibility of that person's testimony.\" CAIR's Legal Director Arsalan Iftikhar said \"CAIR will offer a free copy of the Quran to any judge in North Carolina or throughout the United States for use in oaths or for personal awareness of the holy text.\" CAIR's Legal Director in Washington D.C, Arsalan Iftikhar, said of the case, \"This shows there's a lot of anti-Muslim sentiment, especially here in the United States.\"\n\nOn July 6, 2005, a group of more than 20 religious leaders from the Guilford County area, \"including those of Christian, Jewish and Buddhist faiths\", sent a letter to Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright, who said an oath on the Quran is not lawful. The letter noted that \"North Carolina is an increasingly diverse place and says that religious differences need to be respected.\" It went on to say \"In North Carolina, we continue to be people who take our religious beliefs and practices very seriously. But we no longer live in the Bible Belt. Today, we live in the Bible-Talmud-Qur'an-Veda-Dhammapada-Guru Granth Sahib-Kitabi Iqan Belt. It is imperative for our civic leaders, school teachers, judges, and law enforcers to appreciate and respect the religious differences found in our population.\" The executive director of FaithAction (an interfaith organization) Rev. Mark Sills, signed the letter and said that the Qur'an oath case \"struck us as an issue that needs to be confronted\". He asked Christians to imagine what it would be like to live in a place where the Bible was not allowed for oaths, saying \"That just feels like a slap in the face.\" Rev. Julie Peeples, pastor of Greensboro's Congregational United Church of Christ, signed the letter and said \"I think it's an opportunity to foster greater respect for all the traditions we have in Greensboro.\" The superintendent of the Greensboro District of the United Methodist Church, Rev. Frank Stith, said \"it makes sense for people to be able to use a book that means something to them\", explaining \"The point is to have something that stands behind someone's word.\"\n\nThe North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union became involved when on June 28, 2005 they called on the AOC to \"adopt a policy allowing the use of the Quran and other religious texts for the swearing of oaths in court proceedings\". When on July 14, 2005 the state Administrative Office of the Courts declined to intervene (indicating \"that either the legislature or a court ruling would have to decide this question\") the ACLU took the issue to court. In July 2005 they argued in court that \"the term 'Holy Scriptures' appearing in the statute refers not only to the Christian Bible, but also to other religious texts including, but not limited to, the Quran, the Old Testament, and the Bhagavad-Gita\". The ACLU argued that since in 1985 \"the term 'Gospels' was eliminated from the section [on oaths] and the term 'Holy Evangelists of Almighty God' was changed to 'Holy Scriptures', the message sent by the Legislature was clear: no longer would the Christian Bible be the only religious text which could be used in a swearing ceremony. Stated differently, the term 'Holy Scriptures' is broad enough to include the Quran.\" The state attorney general's office argued in court papers that the ACLU lacked the right to sue because there is no controversy between them and the state of North Carolina. This led them to add Muslim Syidah Mateen as a plaintiff on November 29, 2005.\n\nMichele Combs, communications director of the Christian Coalition said \"We don't have a state-run religion in this country and it's an honor to worship here, but some traditions that we've had for 200 years need to stay.\"\n\nErik Stanley, a lawyer for the Christian law group \"Liberty Counsel\" claimed the suit \"was not simply intended to include other faiths\". He went on to say: \"The ACLU is not attempting to bring accommodation. That already exists. They're trying to erase history. Courtroom oaths have always been done on the Bible.\"\n\nOn December 5, 2005, Superior Court Judge Donald L. Smith (serving as an emergency judge) heard arguments on the case in a hearing that lasted less than half an hour. Lawyers on both sides were given seven and one-half minutes to make their case and no witnesses were heard. Assistant Attorney General Grady L. Balentine Jr. argued \"that state oath-taking law is constitutional because it allows people to affirm if they don't wish to swear on the Christian Bible. No one is required to do that, that's our only position in this case.\" The ACLU's attorney Seth Cohen argued that if \"Holy Scriptures\" is interpreted to not include non-Christian texts, then the law is unconstitutional, as \"the exclusive use of the Christian Bible for courtroom oaths violates the First Amendment's Establishment Clause in the U.S. Constitution\". Both lawyers answered one of the Judge's questions by agreeing to \"a longstanding legal tradition: When a law is susceptible to multiple interpretations, a judge should always rely on the interpretation that makes the law constitutional.\"\n\nIn his ruling Judge Smith dismissed Mateen's case, in part \"because Mateen was able to testify that day, no legal controversy remained\". Judge Smith \"did not address whether state law allows people to use non-Christian texts for oath-taking, the main issue the ACLU wanted resolved\". The executive director of the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU, Jennifer Rudinger, said \"it would be very difficult for a person wishing to swear on a non-Christian text to halt a courtroom proceeding to pursue a legal challenge on the issue\". Mateen said \"Had I known that it would be taken to this point, I wouldn't have affirmed. I could have postponed everything until they got some Qurans.\" The ACLU was also surprised that Judge Smith cited \"lack of an actual controversy\" as a reason for dismissal because Grady Balentine, the lawyer for the state attorney general's office, did not make that argument. Balentine had only argued \"that the law gives people another option if they don't wish to swear on the Christian Bible\".\n\nOn December 15, 2005, a week after Smith's ruling, the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU announced they would appeal the decision. Their lawyer Seth Cohen told reporters \"that the organization disagrees with the judge's finding\" and that he was \"confident they will win in the N.C. Court of Appeals\". Cohen went on to say: \"It's a shame that this matter cannot be resolved sooner. All we have ever asked is that people of all faiths be able to put their hands on the holy text of their choice. It's that simple. We don't understand why this is such a big deal.\" Cohen also said that members of Judaism have thrown their support behind the case as they would like to be able to swear on the Tanakh, and that this joining over the issue was one of the things \"that's gotten lost in this case\".\n\nOn January 16, 2007, a three-judge panel of the North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled unanimously to reverse the trial court decision that had dismissed the case. The appeals court found that the issue was not moot. The Court's ruling also mentioned it received \"affidavits from eight Jewish members of ACLU-NC who were residents of Guilford County and eligible for jury duty, stating they would prefer to swear on the Hebrew Bible rather than the Christian Bible if selected as jurors or asked to testify in court\".\n\nThe Court reviewed the history of the case, noting that \"When Ms. Mateen appeared as a witness, she requested that her oath to tell the truth be sworn on the holy text of her religious faith, the Quran. When her request was denied and because she would not swear on the Christian Bible, her options were to affirm without the use of a religious text or be denied the opportunity to testify. ... Ms. Mateen chose to affirm to tell the truth, and she now seeks a declaratory judgment determining whether, under N.C.G.S. § 11-2, she has the right to swear on her holy text, the Quran.\" \n\nThe Court held that the case should go forward, because without a court decision on the matter a conflict was unavoidable, saying \"Under these circumstances, Ms. Mateen clearly demonstrated her intent to avail herself of her asserted right to swear on her religious text and her intent to litigate that right. The State has clearly demonstrated, by its refusal to permit witnesses to swear on any text other than the Christian Bible, its intent to continue the course of action; thus, its actions are not speculative [which would not merit allowing the case to go forward]. ... ACLU-NC argues that it is not a matter of 'if' one of its [8,000] members who would prefer to swear on a different religious text will be called to serve as a juror or witness, but rather it is a matter of 'when'. We agree.\"\n\nThe court stressed that it was only calling for the case to go forward, and was not itself judging the cases merits, saying \"The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether either plaintiff has presented a justiciable controversy in their complaint. We conclude the complaint is sufficient to entitle both plaintiffs to litigate their claims under the Declaratory Judgment Act, though we are careful to express no opinion on the merits of those claims.\"\n\nSeth Cohen, General Counsel for the N.C. ACLU stated: \"We are very happy with the Court of Appeals' decision today. This is an important issue that affects thousands of people of faith across North Carolina who are not of the Christian faith, and we look forward to a hearing on the Constitutional questions raised by this case.\"\n\nMateen repeated her position in an interview after the Appeals Court allowed the case to go forward, saying she always \"felt like, in this day and time, that they would at least have the three major religious texts in the courtroom. If it was a Quran in the courtroom and a Christian was in there, would they want to testify on a holy Quran?\"\n\nThe ACLU reports on its website that \"The state Attorney General has 30 days [from the January 16, 2007 ruling] to decide whether to seek discretionary review by the North Carolina Supreme Court. If the North Carolina Supreme Court does not review the ruling by the Court of Appeals, then the case will go back to the superior court for a review of the Constitutional challenge to the statute.\"\n\nNoelle Talley spokeswoman for the state Attorney General confirmed that the office is \"reviewing the ruling but hasn't decided about an appeal\".\n\nOn May 24, 2007, Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway ruled that people of non-Christian faiths must be allowed to use religious texts other than the Christian Bible when being sworn in as jurors or witnesses in state court proceedings. Though the state had 30 days to decide to appeal the ruling, it took no action.\n\nSome have seen this matter \"as the latest case of religious liberty to arise in North Carolina. In other cases, employers have been challenged to allow Sikhs to keep their beards and Muslim women to wear veils.\" University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Professor of Religion, Thomas Tweed said \"This North Carolina case is another example of the ways America's expanding religious diversity is coming into conflict with established practices in the public arena.\"\n\nNew York University law professor Noah Feldman said \"This case is a cousin to the Ten Commandments case in Alabama, where a judge does something that's pretty obviously unconstitutional, with a goal of sending a message ... that he's for fundamental religious values.\"\n\nThe \"Christian Science Monitor\" noted that in contrast to Judge Albright most American judges in recent history \"have apparently given other oaths wide latitude. In a federal terrorism case in 1997 in Washington D.C., for instance, the judge allowed Muslim witnesses to swear to Allah. And the practice isn't new: Mochitsura Hashimoto, the Japanese submarine commander who in 1945, was allowed by a military tribunal to swear on his beliefs of Shinto, the ancient religion of Japan.\"\n\nThe \"Christian Science Monitor\" also quoted Manish Vij, a New York blogger for Sepia Mutiny who said, \"The only thing more compelling [to] ... South Asian Muslims is to literally swear upon your mother's head, and mothers aren't as convenient to drag around in court as a copy of the Koran.\"\n\nMany media accounts have linked this story with Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress that involved Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the first Muslim elected to the US Congress. Ellison's desire to use a Qur'an at the ceremonial reenactment of his oath, while symbolically important, was never a judicial issue. The swearing-in was \"en masse\" and involved no texts whatsoever. Both of the main figures taking issue with Ellison, Dennis Prager and US Representative Virgil Goode of Virginia, made sure to clarify that they were not asking for him to be banned from serving if he insisted on using a Qur'an instead of a Bible at his reenactment photo-op. In this regard the Matten case is far more significant.\n\nOne commentator laid out the likely outcome should the Matteen case not be judged on its merits, saying one day a non-Christian would appear before a North Carolina judge and would \"create an impasse in court when he refuses to swear on the Bible and declines to affirm an oath, insisting he should be allowed to place his hand on the Quran or some other holy book and promise before his God to tell the truth\". The judge could then \"hold the uncooperative witness in contempt, in effect punishing a person who simply asks that his religious beliefs be granted the same respect as those of a Christian. ... [and] While holding the witness in contempt, the judge also could bar the testimony that would have been offered—thereby jeopardizing the case of one party or the other. ...Or the judge could let the witness testify without swearing or affirming to tell the truth. But that would invite a challenge to the validity of the testimony—another legal controversy.\"\n\n\n"}

It is an open problem in the field of number theory and is widely recognized as one of the most challenging mathematical problems. The conjecture was chosen as one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, which has offered a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct proof. It is named after mathematicians Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer who developed the conjecture during the first half of the 1960s with the help of machine computation. , only special cases of the conjecture have been proved.\n\nThe modern formulation of the conjecture relates arithmetic data associated with an elliptic curve \"E\" over a number field \"K\" to the behaviour of the Hasse–Weil \"L\"-function \"L\"(\"E\", \"s\") of \"E\" at \"s\" = 1. More specifically, it is conjectured that the rank of the abelian group \"E\"(\"K\") of points of \"E\" is the order of the zero of \"L\"(\"E\", \"s\") at \"s\" = 1, and the first non-zero coefficient in the Taylor expansion of \"L\"(\"E\", \"s\") at \"s\" = 1 is given by more refined arithmetic data attached to \"E\" over \"K\" .\n\n proved Mordell's theorem: the group of rational points on an elliptic curve has a finite basis. This means that for any elliptic curve there is a finite sub-set of the rational points on the curve, from which all further rational points may be generated.\n\nIf the number of rational points on a curve is infinite then some point in a finite basis must have infinite order. The number of \"independent\" basis points with infinite order is called the rank of the curve, and is an important invariant property of an elliptic curve.\n\nIf the rank of an elliptic curve is 0, then the curve has only a finite number of rational points. On the other hand, if the rank of the curve is greater than 0, then the curve has an infinite number of rational points.\n\nAlthough Mordell's theorem shows that the rank of an elliptic curve is always finite, it does not give an effective method for calculating the rank of every curve. The rank of certain elliptic curves can be calculated using numerical methods but (in the current state of knowledge) it is unknown if these methods handle all curves.\n\nAn \"L\"-function \"L\"(\"E\", \"s\") can be defined for an elliptic curve \"E\" by constructing an Euler product from the number of points on the curve modulo each prime \"p\". This \"L\"-function is analogous to the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet L-series that is defined for a binary quadratic form. It is a special case of a Hasse–Weil L-function.\n\nThe natural definition of \"L\"(\"E\", \"s\") only converges for values of \"s\" in the complex plane with Re(\"s\") > 3/2. Helmut Hasse conjectured that \"L\"(\"E\", \"s\") could be extended by analytic continuation to the whole complex plane. This conjecture was first proved by for elliptic curves with complex multiplication. It was subsequently shown to be true for all elliptic curves over Q, as a consequence of the modularity theorem.\n\nFinding rational points on a general elliptic curve is a difficult problem. Finding the points on an elliptic curve modulo a given prime \"p\" is conceptually straightforward, as there are only a finite number of possibilities to check. However, for large primes it is computationally intensive.\n\nIn the early 1960s Peter Swinnerton-Dyer used the EDSAC-2 computer at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to calculate the number of points modulo \"p\" (denoted by \"N\") for a large number of primes \"p\" on elliptic curves whose rank was known. From these numerical results conjectured that \"N\" for a curve \"E\" with rank \"r\" obeys an asymptotic law\n\nwhere \"C\" is a constant.\n\nInitially this was based on somewhat tenuous trends in graphical plots; this induced a measure of skepticism in J. W. S. Cassels (Birch's Ph.D. advisor). Over time the numerical evidence stacked up.\n\nThis in turn led them to make a general conjecture about the behaviour of a curve's L-function \"L\"(\"E\", \"s\") at \"s\" = 1, namely that it would have a zero of order \"r\" at this point. This was a far-sighted conjecture for the time, given that the analytic continuation of \"L\"(\"E\", \"s\") there was only established for curves with complex multiplication, which were also the main source of numerical examples. (NB that the reciprocal of the L-function is from some points of view a more natural object of study; on occasion this means that one should consider poles rather than zeroes.)\n\nThe conjecture was subsequently extended to include the prediction of the precise leading Taylor coefficient of the L-function at \"s\" = 1. It is conjecturally given by\n\nwhere the quantities on the right hand side are invariants of the curve, studied by Cassels, Tate, Shafarevich and others: these include the order of the torsion group, the order of the Tate–Shafarevich group, and the canonical heights of a basis of rational points .\n\nThe Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture has been proved only in special cases:\n\n\nNothing has been proved for curves with rank greater than 1, although there is extensive numerical evidence for the truth of the conjecture.\n\nMuch like the Riemann hypothesis, this conjecture has multiple consequences, including the following two:\n\n\n"}

In its most extreme form, bisexual erasure can include the belief that bisexuality does not exist.\n\nBisexual erasure may include the assertion that all bisexual individuals are in a phase and will soon choose a side, either heterosexual or homosexual. One reason for this is the belief that bisexual individuals are distinctively indecisive. Gross misrepresentations of bisexual individuals as hypersexual erases the sexual agency of bisexuals, effectively erasing their true identities as well. Bisexual erasure is also often a manifestation of biphobia, although it does not necessarily involve overt antagonism.\n\nThere is increasing inclusion and visibility of bisexuals, particularly in the LGBT community.\n\nAccording to scholar Kenji Yoshino, there are three main investments that motivate both self-identified homosexuals and heterosexuals to seek to culturally erase bisexuality. These motivations are firstly sexual orientation stabilization. This relieves people of the anxiety of having sexual orientation questioned, an untenable position since it is in fact unprovable. There is a belief that bisexuals are simply undecided, and that they are fundamentally homosexual or heterosexual. This isolates, marginalises and makes bisexuals invisible within the community. Secondly, the maintenance of the importance of gender, which is seen as erotically essential to monosexuals while this notion is challenged by the existence of bisexuality. Thirdly, the maintenance of monogamy since for mainstream Americans, a pair bond is preferred. However, bisexuals are generally assumed by monosexuals to be \"intrinsically\" non-monogamous. Juana Maria Rodriguez adds to Yoshino's argument and posits that bisexuality breaks down traditional understandings of sexuality and the gender binary. Thus, individuals both in the dominant culture and in the queer community resist bisexuality.\n\nIn an article written for the 10th anniversary of Yoshino's piece, Heron Greenesmith argues that bisexuality is in fact inherently invisible in the law, beyond the reach of deliberate erasure. Firstly, she says it is because bisexuality is legally irrelevant with plaintiffs presumed to be monosexual unless outed and secondly, that when bisexuality is legally relevant it is erased within the legal culture since it complicates legal arguments that depend on a gender binary nature of sexuality.\n\nAmerican psychologist Beth Firestone writes that since she wrote her first book on bisexuality, in 1996, \"bisexuality has gained visibility, although progress is uneven and awareness of bisexuality is still minimal or absent in many of the more remote regions of our country and internationally\".\n\nRichard C. Friedman, an academic psychiatrist who specializes in the psychodynamics of homosexuality, writes in his essay \"Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men\" that many gay men have experienced sexual fantasies about women or engaged in sex with women and that many straight men have experienced sexual fantasies about men or engaged in sex with men. Despite being bisexual in fantasy and activity, these men identify as \"gay\" or \"straight\" rather than as bisexual. This erasure of bisexuality is sometimes caused by denying the significance of an erotic encounter in order to maintain a person's sexual identity and sense of community; a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a woman in order to maintain his identity as a \"gay man\" and his membership in the gay community, or a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a man in order to maintain his status as a heterosexual man in heteronormative society.\n\nWriting for Bisexual.org, author and columnist Zachary Zane cites a study showing that 20.7% of straight-identified men watched gay pornography and 7.5% reported having sex with a man in the past six months, while 55% of gay-identified men had watched heterosexual pornography and 0.7% reported having sex with a woman in the past six months. He argues that some of the straight-identified men are actually gay or bisexual but are erasing their bisexuality due to internalized biphobia and denial in order to claim a straight identity label. Pointing out that the majority of gay-identified men watched heterosexual pornography but few had recent heterosexual sex, he suggests that many self-identified gay men have sexual fantasies about women and in an ideal world would be openly bisexual and freely explore sex with women, but society pressures gay men to \"pick a side\" so those men \"subsequently have picked being gay\".\n\nBisexual author and activist Robyn Ochs has argued that gay men are less possessive of their \"gay\" label than lesbians are of their label. She argues that there is less hostility to bisexual men who identify as gay than bisexual women who identify as lesbian, that there is a great deal of sexual fluidity between gay men and bisexual men, and that consequently more gay-identified men openly admit to being attracted to and having sex with women. However, Ochs also argues that many bisexual men identify as gay in order to politically align themselves with the gay community. She says that since coming out is so difficult for gay men, many do not want to come out a second time as bisexual; the existence of male bisexuality can be threatening to some gay men because it raises the possibility that they themselves might be bisexual.\n\nGay male activist Carl Wittman, writing in his \"Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto\", argued that gay men should identify as \"gay\" rather than as \"bisexual\", even if they sleep with women. Stating that gay men should only become bisexual once society accepts homosexuality, he wrote that:Bisexuality is good; it is the capacity to love people of either sex. The reason so few of us are bisexual is because society made such a big stink about homosexuality that we got forced into seeing ourselves as either straight or non-straight. Also, many gays go turned off to the ways men are supposed to act with women and vice-versa, which is pretty f---ed-up. Gays will begin to turn on to women when 1) it's something that we do because we want to, and not because we should, and 2) when women's liberation changes the nature of heterosexual relationships. We continue to call ourselves homosexual, not bisexual, even if we do make it with the opposite sex also, because saying \"Oh, I'm Bi\" is a copout for a gay. We get told it's OK to sleep with guys as long as we sleep with women, too, and that's still putting homosexuality down. We'll be gay until everyone has forgotten that it's an issue. Then we'll begin to be complete.- Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto I.3\n\nWhile there have been reports from bisexual men and women about feeling unwelcome in the gay and lesbian communities due to accusations of homophobia for a long time, there is a recent increase in reports from bisexual men (more so than from bisexual women) about accusations of being predisposed towards homophobia that cite psychology and statistics. One example is biphobia that cite penile plethysmograph statistics that appear to show a concentration of bisexual genital responses specifically in homophobic men. Members of the bisexual community as well as some scholars argue that this skews the studies towards a self-fulfilling prophecy in which non-homophobic men with genital responses to both men and women (both truly bisexual men and merely nonconcordant men) are deterred from taking part in the studies out of a fear of being accused of having a predisposition towards homophobia. This is argued to be a cause of bisexual male erasure that gives an appearance of bisexuality being rarer in men, especially in non-homophobic men. These open bisexuals and scholars reply to the objection that the theory of a link between male bisexuality and homophobia is population level and not to every individual by pointing out that ethics informed by population level statistics do affect individuals who are told to live by the ethics, arguing that just as statistics that appear to show a link between theories of immutable sexuality and acceptance of homosexuality are used to declare criticism of such immutability theories to be unethical, statistics that appear to show a link between bisexual orientation and homophobia can just as well be used to declare the condition of simply having a bisexual orientation unethical, resulting in biphobia. It is argued that similar self-fulfilling prophecies apply there (non-homophobes who do not think that sexuality is immutable being pressured by social false dichotomies and few-choice polls to falsely claim either that they believe in immutable sexuality or that they have something against homosexuality which may increase the number of members in homophobic groups by forcing non-homophobes to claim homophobia), citing that many past attempts to \"cure\" homosexuality relied on hormonal medication which is incompatible with the claim that those who tried such conversion believed in social environmental determinism. It is also cited that bisexual men report even more fear than gay men due to not being accepted in either heteronormative or gay communities and argued that waiting for a purported \"society as a whole\" to accept homosexuality is futile due to dichotomous societies being inherently polarized.\n\nHeterosexual (straight) and gay people who engage in bisexual erasure may claim that bisexuals are either exclusively homosexual (gay/lesbian) or exclusively heterosexual, closeted gay or lesbian people who wish to appear heterosexual, or are heterosexuals who are experimenting with their sexuality. A common manifestation of bisexual erasure is a tendency for bisexuals to be referred to as heterosexual when they are intimately involved with people of the opposite sex, and to be labeled as homosexual when they are involved with people of the same sex.\n\nBisexual erasure may stem from a belief that the bisexual community does not deserve equal status or inclusion within gay and lesbian communities. This can take the form of omitting the word \"bisexual\" in the name of an organization or event that serves the whole LGBT community, including it as \"bi-sexual\", implying that there are only two authentic sexual orientations, or treating the subject of bisexuality in a derogatory way.\n\nHistorically, bisexual women have had their sexuality labeled by lesbian feminist circles as an \"apolitical cop-out\". Bisexual women have been seen as \"not radical enough\" because of their attraction to cisgender men. Rodriguez asserts that bisexuality was regarded as anti-feminist by many lesbians because of the implied \"desires for penetration, sexual dominance, and submission,\" and gender roles. Bisexual vilification and erasure by the community may not be as open and prevalent today, but identifying as bisexual can still lead to exclusion and erasure in many lesbian spaces.\n\nIn 2013, a study published in the \"Journal of Bisexuality\" surveyed thirty people who identified as part of the lesbian, gay, queer or bisexual communities and their individual experiences with coming out. Ten of these people reported that they claimed the label of bisexuality first, and later came out again as lesbian, gay, or queer. The theory that emerged in this study introduced the concept of the \"queer apologetic\", in which one attempts to reconcile their same-gender attraction with the social norm of heterosexuality.\n\nBisexuals have been overlooked in the same-sex marriage debate: Where same-sex marriage is illegal, those campaigning for it have failed to highlight the inconsistencies of marriage laws in relation to bisexuals, whose right to marry depends solely on the gender of their partner. Secondly, when same-sex marriage is available, a bisexual partner will generally be referred to as lesbian or gay. For example, one of the first people to take part in a same-sex marriage in America, Robyn Ochs, was widely referred to in the media as a lesbian, despite identifying herself in interviews as bisexual.\n\nFor many years, the Lambda Literary Awards did not have a category for bisexual literary works, which was finally established in 2006 after lobbying by BiNet USA.\n\nAlternative approaches to the concept of bisexuality have been developed that expand the definition of sexual identity outward from a \"this \"or\" that\" mentality to a \"this \"and\" that\" mentality. Jenée Wilde presents the idea of what she calls \"dimensional sexuality\" in an article for \"Sexual and Relationship Therapy\", a theoretical framework in which gender is not the primary factor in sexual attraction, rather it is one of many axes. These other axes of attraction can include the desire for either monogamy or polyamory, and the fluidity of desire for the various gender(s) in a partner over time. Wilde uses her framework to broaden the scale of sexual identity from a simple binary spectrum from \"mono-sexual\" to \"bisexual\", and to establish relationships between these identities; these relationships would not alienate individuals without a single \"fixed object\" of attraction.\n\nViewpoints like Wilde's have been applied by scholars such as Laura Erickson-Schroth and Jennifer Mitchell to pieces of pop-culture and literature; Steven Angelides also produced a book on the place of bisexuality in research and societal awareness throughout history, using a similar framework. Both pieces aim to achieve more inclusive readings of sexuality and allow for the re-designation of literary figures and real people as bisexual, rather than continuing with the assumption that any same-gender activity, explicit or implied, is homosexual, and any opposite-gender activity heterosexual.\n\nAn example of a viewpoint similar to Wilde's is D.S. Neff's reading of Lord Byron's \"Childe\" \"Harold's Pilgrimage\", which finds that the poem is ambiguous in its mentioning of \"concubines and carnal companie\" as well as later parts of the work; Neff finds these ambiguities to be implications that both male and female lovers were had by the protagonist. This bisexual portrayal is supported through Byron's real-world interactions with lovers of multiple genders, and the culture of his literary affiliates at Cambridge condoning those interactions in the midst of the 19th century's moral panic around same-gender desires.\n\nErickson-Schroth and Mitchell's 2009 article in the \"Journal of Bisexuality\" performs a similar analysis of \"Written on the Body\" by Jeanette Winterson and \"Well of Loneliness\" by Radclyffe Hall; the assertion behind these scholars' work is that bisexual experience has existed all throughout the history of humanity, and while it has only recently been acknowledged even in queer and LGBT circles, it is in no way an exclusively modern phenomenon.\n\nThere are also interpretations of literature that focus on the symbolic expressions of bisexuality rather than its explicit mention. Linda K. Hughes' analysis of Alexander Smith's \"A Life-Drama\" contends the atypical nature of the heterosexual courtship in the poem stands in place of the romance between the main character's \"intimate friendship\" with another man. Other analyses use the subtextual practices and common allusions of the Victorian period/19th century that referenced bisexuality or homosexuality to show the presence of bisexual themes in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" and Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\".\n\nBisexual individuals have largely been overlooked in academic literature. Hemmings posits that bisexual erasure is essential in queer studies to keep lesbians and gay men as the main subjects of study. Bisexuals are often included under the umbrella of LGBT+ in academic studies. However, data specific to bisexuals is lacking. Historically, academics began to study bisexuals in relation to HIV and AIDS. These studies contributed to the mythology that bisexuals have a higher chance of transmitting HIV and AIDS.\n\nSome media outlets have portrayed bisexual behaviors in ancient and non-Western cultures, such as ancient Greek pederasty or Native American Two-Spirits, as proof that homosexuality has been widely accepted in other times and cultures, even though it can also be seen as proof of the existence and acceptance of bisexuality.\n\nIn both the gay and straight media, individuals who have kept their sexual identity unknown have been portrayed as either gay or straight, even when they engaged in romantic or sexual relationships with both men and women. The same has occurred even with people who identify themselves as bisexual. Ani DiFranco's 1998 marriage to Andrew Gilchrist was portrayed in both gay and mainstream media as renouncing lesbianism, even though she had been out as bisexual since the very beginning of her career. Cynthia Nixon faced public criticism in 2012 when an awkwardly-worded interview quote about her bisexuality led many to believe she was saying she had chosen to become a lesbian. Madonna has called herself bisexual in interviews and has frequently engaged in public acts of same-sex intimacy with other female celebrities, but is typically portrayed by media as a heterosexual woman who dabbles in lesbian imagery for pure shock value, with any possibility that she might be genuinely bisexual being discounted entirely. Lady Gaga is sometimes labelled as either \"gay\" or \"straight\" in the media even though she has publicly identified as bisexual. Freddie Mercury, who according to his obituary was a \"self-confessed bisexual,\" is often depicted as gay by the media.\n\nThe media in both communities also often refers to the \"gay and lesbian\" community, ignoring bisexual and/or transgender people.\n\nBisexual women specifically are subject to both hypervisibility and erasure. Bisexual women are over-represented in pornography, reality television, and music videos as part of the male gaze. However, representations of bisexual women as agents in their own sexuality are lacking. Erasure of sexual agency for bisexual women of color is prevalent within the media as well. Bisexuality stereotypically implies a sense of uncontrolled sexual desire; this is then intensified for women of color who are already hypersexualized.\n\nOn December 30, 2009, MTV premiered their 23rd season of the show \"The Real World\", featuring two bisexual participants, Emily Schromm, and Mike Manning. Although Manning himself identifies as bisexual, many bloggers and commenters on blogs claimed that he was in fact gay. Furthermore, while a behind-the-scenes MTV Aftershow and subsequent interview revealed that both Manning and Schromm had had encounters with both men and women while on the show, the show was edited to make it seem as though they had only been with men.\n\nIndividuals identifying as bisexual have been absent from dialogue during discourse about LGBT-rights and litigation. Examples include the early use of the term \"gay marriage\" as opposed to \"same-sex marriage\" or \"marriage equality,\" as well as the lack of mention of bisexuality in briefs or in opinions handed down by the courts.\n\nA survey of relevant terminology in LBGT-rights cases found that, minus a brief period in U.S. Supreme Court history when bisexuals were mentioned alongside gays and lesbians bisexuality has not been mentioned in Supreme Court opinions or briefs in major LGBT rights cases, which too often describe gays and lesbians as exclusively affected by sexual orientation discrimination. \n\nWhile courts have begun to more frequently used the term \"same-sex\" in litigation involving sexual minority groups, this term is still often used interchangeably with \"gay\", \"lesbian\", and \"homosexual\", therefore erasing the bisexual contingent. Nancy Marcus uses the monumental Obergefell v. Hodges case that granted same-sex marriage rights as an example of nearly complete erasure of bisexuality despite efforts by legal organizations such as BiLaw, including an amicus brief to the Supreme Court and outreach to the plaintiffs' legal team. This is important in the U.S. legal system when law is developed through case law, since not mentioning bisexual identities in legal decisions implies a \"secondary\" status of bisexuals within the LGBT community, with the judiciary appearing to give the imprimatur to the relegation of bisexuality to a lesser, or completely ignored, status. \n\nMarcus states that misunderstanding and erasure of bisexuality within the US legal system results in tangible harm to bisexual litigants, including the increased likelihood of losing parental rights and the probability of being denied asylum from anti-LGBT countries. Custody issues arise due to the belief that bisexual people are too unstable to be parents, while bisexuals seeking asylum from countries hostile to LGBT individuals are viewed with suspicion, including not being \"gay enough.\" This is due to a common assumption within the legal community that a person can only be legitimately attracted to one gender; therefore a bisexual asylum-seeker is more likely to be considered a fraud.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58952772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58952772", "title": "Comparative illusion", "text": "Comparative illusion\n\nIn linguistics, comparative illusions (CIs) or Escher sentences are certain comparative sentences which initially seem to be acceptable but upon closer reflection have no well-formed meaning. The typical example sentence used to typify this phenomenon is \"More people have been to Russia than I have\". The effect has also been observed in other languages. Some studies have suggested that, at least in English, the effect is stronger for sentences whose predicate is repeatable. The effect has also been found to be stronger in some cases when there is a plural subject in the second clause.\n\nEscher sentences are ungrammatical because a matrix clause subject like \"more people\" is making a comparison between two sets of individuals, but there is no such set of individuals in the second clause. For the sentence to be grammatical, the subject of the second clause must be a bare plural. Linguists have marked that it is \"striking\" that despite the grammar of these sentences not possibly having a meaningful interpretation that people so often report that they sound acceptable, and that it is \"remarkable\" that people seldom notice any error.\n\nMario Montalbetti's 1984 Massachusetts Institute of Technology dissertation has been credited as being the first to note these sorts of sentences; in his prologue he gives acknowledgements to Hermann Schultze \"for uttering the most amazing */? sentence I've ever heard: \"More people have been to Berlin than I have\"\", although the dissertation itself does not discuss such sentences. Parallel examples with \"Russia\" instead of \"Berlin\" were briefly discussed in psycholinguistic work in the 1990s and 2000s by Thomas Bever and colleagues.\n\nGeoffrey K. Pullum wrote about this phenomenon in a 2004 post on \"Language Log\" after Jim McCloskey brought it to his attention. In a post the following day, Mark Liberman gave the name \"Escher sentences\" to such sentences in reference to M. C. Escher's 1960 lithograph \"Ascending and Descending\". He wrote:\nAlthough rare, actual attestations of this construction have appeared in natural speech. \"Language Log\" has noted examples such as:\n\nExperiments on the acceptability of comparative illusion sentences has found results which are \"highly variable both within and across studies\". While the illusion of acceptability for comparative illusions has also informally reported for speakers of Faroese, German, Icelandic, Polish, and Swedish, systematic investigation has mostly centered on English, although Aarhus University neurolinguist Ken Ramshøj Christensen has run several experiments on comparative illusions in Danish.\n\nWhen Danish and Swedish speakers were asked what (1) means, their responses fell into one of the following categories:\nParaphrase (d) is in fact the only possible interpretation of (1); this is possible due to the lexical ambiguity of \"have\" between an auxiliary verb and a lexical verb just as the English \"have\"; however the majority of participants (da: 78.9%; sv: 56%) gave a paraphrase which does not follow from the grammar. Another study where Danish participants had to pick from a set of paraphrases, say it meant something else, or say it was meaningless found that people selected \"It does not make sense\" for comparative illusions 63% of the time and selected it meant something 37% of the time.\n\nThe first study examining what affects acceptability of these sentences was presented at the 2004 CUNY Conference on Human Sentencing Processing. Scott Fults and Collin Phillips found that Escher sentences with ellipsis (a) were found to be more acceptable than the same sentences without ellipsis (b).\nResponses to this study noted that it only compared elided material to nothing, and that that even in grammatical comparatives, ellipsis of repeated phrases is preferred. In order to control for the awkwardness of identical predicates, Alexis Wellwood and colleagues compared comparative illusions with ellipsis to those with a different predicate.\nThey found that both CI-type and control sentences were found to be slightly more acceptable with ellipsis, which led them to reject the hypothesis that ellipsis was responsible for the acceptability of CIs. Rather, it's possible people just prefer shorter sentences in general. Patrick Kelley's Michigan State University dissertation found similar results.\n\nAlexis Wellwood and colleagues have found in experiments that the illusion of grammaticality is greater when the sentence's predicate is repeatable. For instance, (a) is experimentally found to be more acceptable than (b).\n\nThe comparative must be in the subject position for the illusion to work; sentences like (a) which also have verb phrase ellipsis are viewed as unacceptable without any illusion of acceptability:\n\nA pilot study by Iria de Dios-Flores also found that repeatability of the predicate had an effect on the acceptability of CIs in English. However, Christensen's study on comparative illusions in Danish did not find a significant difference in acceptability for sentences with repeatable predicates (a) and those without (b).\n\nThe lexical ambiguity of the English quantifier \"more\" has led to a hypothesis where the acceptability of CIs is due to people reinterpreting a \"comparative\" \"more\" as an \"additive\" \"more\". As \"fewer\" does not have such an ambiguity, Wellwood and colleagues tested to see if there was any difference in acceptability judgements depending on whether the sentences used \"fewer\" or \"more\". In general, their study found significantly higher acceptability for sentences with \"more\" than with \"fewer\" but the difference did not disproportionately affect the comparative illusion sentences compared to the controls.\n\nChristensen found no significant difference in acceptability for Danish CIs with (\"more\") compared to those with (\"fewer\").\n\nExperiments have also investigated the effects different kinds of subjects in the \"than\"-clause have on CIs' acceptability. Wellwood and colleagues found that sentences with first person singular pronoun \"I\" to be more acceptable than those with the third person singular pronoun \"he\", though they note this might be due to discourse effects and the lack of a prior antecedent for \"he\". They found no significant difference for sentences with a singular third person pronoun (\"he\") and those with a singular definite description (\"the boy\"). There was no difference in number for the first person pronominal subject (\"I\" vs. \"we\"), but plural definite descriptions (\"the boys\") were significantly more acceptable than singular definite descriptions (\"the boy\"). Christensen found that plural subjects (, \"women\") in the \"than\"-clause led to significantly higher acceptability ratings than singular subjects ( \"the hairdresser\").\n\nDe Dios-Flores examined if there was an effect depending on whether or not the \"than\"-clause subject could be a subset of the matrix subject as in (a) compared to those where it could not be due to a gender mismatch as in (b). No significant differences were found.\n\nIn a study of Danish speakers, CIs with prepositional sentential adverbials like \"in the evening\" were found to be less acceptable than those without.\n\nComparatives in Bulgarian can optionally have the degree operator (); sentences with this morpheme (a) are immediately found unacceptable but those without it (b) produce the same illusion of acceptability.\n\nA neuroimaging study of Danish speakers found less activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left premotor cortex (BA 4, 6), and left posterior temporal cortex (BA 21, 22) when processing CIs like (a) than when processing grammatical clausal comparatives like (b). Christensen has suggested this shows CIs are easy to process but as they are nonsensical, processing is \"shallow\". Low LIFG activation levels also suggest that people do not perceive CIs as being semantically anomalous.\n\nTownsend and Bever have posited that Escher sentences get perceived as acceptable because they are an apparent blend of two grammatical templates.\nWellwood and colleagues have noted in response that the possibility of each clause being grammatical in a different sentence (a, b) does not guarantee a blend (c) would be acceptable.\nWellwood and colleagues also interpret Townsend and Bever's theory as requiring a shared lexical element in each template. If this version is right, they predict (c) would be viewed as less acceptable due to the ungrammaticality of (b):\nWellwood and colleagues, based on their experimental results, have rejected Townsend and Bever's hypothesis and instead support their event comparison hypothesis, which states that comparative illusions are due to speakers reinterpreting these sentences as discussing a comparison of events.\n\nThe term \"comparative illusion\" has sometimes been used as an umbrella term which also encompasses \"depth charge\" sentences like \"No head injury is too trivial to be ignored.\" This example, first discussed by Peter Cathcart Wason and Shuli Reich in 1979, is very often initially perceived as having the meaning \"No head injury should be ignored—even if it's trivial\", even though upon careful consideration the sentence actually says \"All head injuries should be ignored—even trivial ones.\"\n\nPhillips and colleagues have discussed other \"grammatical illusions\" with respect to attraction, case in German, binding, and negative polarity items; speakers initially find such sentences acceptable, but later realize are ungrammatical.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "915081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=915081", "title": "Differential diagnosis", "text": "Differential diagnosis\n\nIn medicine, a differential diagnosis is the distinguishing of a particular disease or condition from others that present similar clinical features. Differential diagnostic procedures are used by physicians and other trained medical professionals to diagnose the specific disease in a patient, or, at least, to eliminate any imminently life-threatening conditions. Often, each individual option of a possible disease is called a differential diagnosis (e.g. acute bronchitis could be a differential diagnosis in the evaluation of a cough, even if the final diagnosis is common cold).\n\nMore generally, a differential diagnostic procedure is a systematic diagnostic method used to identify the presence of a disease entity where multiple alternatives are possible. This method is essentially a process of elimination or at least a process of obtaining information that shrinks the \"probabilities\" of candidate conditions to negligible levels, by using evidence such as symptoms, patient history, and medical knowledge to adjust epistemic confidences in the mind of the diagnostician (or, for computerized or computer-assisted diagnosis, the software of the system).\n\nDifferential diagnosis can be regarded as implementing aspects of the hypothetico-deductive method, in the sense that the potential presence of candidate diseases or conditions can be viewed as hypotheses that physicians further determine as being true or false.\n\nCommon abbreviations of the term \"differential diagnosis\" include DDx, ddx, DD, D/Dx, ΔΔ, or ΔΔ𝛘.\n\nA differential diagnosis is also commonly used within the field of psychiatry/psychology, where two different diagnoses can be attached to a patient who is exhibiting symptoms which could fit into either diagnosis. For example, a patient who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder may also be given a differential diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, given the similarity in the symptoms of both conditions. \n\nStrategies used in preparing a differential diagnosis list vary with experience of the healthcare provider. While novice providers may work systemically to assess all possible explanations for a patients concerns, those with more experience often draw on clinical experience and pattern recognition to protect the patient from delays, risks, and cost of inefficient strategies or tests. Effective providers utilize an evidence-based approach, complementing their clinical experience with knowledge from clinical research.\n\nA standard of care differential diagnosis has four steps. Patient safety requires that the physician: \n\nIf no diagnosis remains, it means either that the physician made an error, or that the condition is undocumented. The physician removes diagnoses from the list by observing and applying tests that produce different results, depending on which diagnosis is correct.\n\nA mnemonic to help in considering multiple possible pathological processes is \"VINDICATE'M\": \n\n\nThere are several methods for differential diagnostic procedures, and several variants among those. Furthermore, a differential diagnostic procedure can be used concomitantly or alternately with protocols, guidelines, or other diagnostic procedures (such as pattern-recognition or using medical algorithms).\n\nFor example, in case of medical emergency, there may not be enough time to do any detailed calculations or estimations of different probabilities, in which case the ABC protocol (\"Airway, Breathing and Circulation\") may be more appropriate. Later, when the situation is less acute, a more comprehensive differential diagnostic procedure may be adopted.\n\nThe differential diagnostic procedure may be simplified if a \"pathognomonic\" sign or symptom is found (in which case it is almost certain that the target condition is present) or in the absence of a \"sine qua non\" sign or symptom (in which case it is almost certain that the target condition is absent).\n\nA diagnostician can be selective, considering first those disorders that are more likely (a probabilistic approach), more serious if left undiagnosed and untreated (a prognostic approach), or more responsive to treatment if offered (a pragmatic approach). Since the subjective probability of the presence of a condition is never exactly 100% or 0%, the differential diagnostic procedure may aim at specifying these various probabilities to form indications for further action.\n\nThe following are two methods of differential diagnosis, being based on epidemiology and likelihood ratios, respectively.\n\nOne method of performing a differential diagnosis by epidemiology aims to estimate the probability of each candidate condition by comparing their probabilities to have occurred in the first place in the individual. It is based on probabilities related both to the presentation (such as pain) and probabilities of the various candidate conditions (such as diseases).\n\nThe statistical basis for differential diagnosis is Bayes' theorem. As an analogy, when a die has landed the outcome is certain by 100%, but the probability that it Would Have Occurred In the First Place (hereafter abbreviated WHOIFP) is still 1/6. In the same way, the probability that a presentation or condition would have occurred in the first place in an individual (WHOIFPI) is not same as the probability that the presentation or condition \"has\" occurred in the individual, because the presentation \"has\" occurred by 100% certainty in the individual. Yet, the contributive probability fractions of each condition are assumed the same, relatively:\n\nwhere:\n\nWhen an individual presents with a symptom or sign, Pr(Presentation has occurred in individual) is 100% and can therefore be replaced by 1, and can be ignored since division by 1 does not make any difference:\n\nThe total probability of the presentation to have occurred in the individual can be approximated as the sum of the individual candidate conditions:\n\nAlso, the probability of the presentation to have been caused by any candidate condition is proportional to the probability of the condition, depending on what rate it causes the presentation:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe probability that a condition would have occurred in the first place in an individual is approximately equal to that of a population that is as similar to the individual as possible except for the current presentation, compensated where possible by relative risks given by known risk factor that distinguish the individual from the population:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe following table demonstrates how these relations can be made for a series of candidate conditions:\n\nOne additional \"candidate condition\" is the instance of there being no abnormality, and the presentation is only a (usually relatively unlikely) appearance of a basically normal state. Its probability in the population (\"P(No abnormality in population)\") is complementary to the sum of probabilities of \"abnormal\" candidate conditions.\n\nThis example case demonstrates how this method is applied, but does not represent a guideline for handling similar real-world cases. Also, the example uses relatively specified numbers with sometimes several decimals, while in reality, there are often simply rough estimations, such as of likelihoods being \"very high\", \"high\", \"low\" or \"very low\", but still using the general principles of the method.\n\nFor an individual (who becomes the \"patient\" in this example), a blood test of, for example, serum calcium shows a result above the standard reference range, which, by most definitions, classifies as hypercalcemia, which becomes the \"presentation\" in this case. A physician (who becomes the \"diagnostician\" in this example), who does not currently see the patient, gets to know about his finding.\n\nBy practical reasons, the physician considers that there is enough test indication to have a look at the patient’s medical records. For simplicity, let’s say that the only information given in the medical records is a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism (here abbreviated as PH), which may explain the finding of hypercalcemia. For this patient, let’s say that the resultant hereditary risk factor is estimated to confer a relative risk of 10 (RR = 10).\n\nThe physician considers that there is enough motivation to perform a differential diagnostic procedure for the finding of hypercalcemia. The main causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) and cancer, so for simplicity, the list of candidate conditions that the physician could think of can be given as:\n\nThe probability that 'primary hyperparathyroidism' (PH) would have occurred in the first place in the individual (\"P(PH WHOIFPI)\") can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet’s say that the last blood test taken by the patient was half a year ago and was normal, and that the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in a general population that appropriately matches the individual (except for the presentation and mentioned heredity) is 1 in 4000 per year. Ignoring more detailed retrospective analyses (such as including speed of disease progress and lag time of medical diagnosis), the time-at-risk for having developed primary hyperparathyroidism can roughly be regarded as being the last half-year, because a previously developed hypercalcemia would probably have been caught up by the previous blood test. This corresponds to a probability of primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) in the population of:\n\nWith the relative risk conferred from the family history, the probability that primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) would have occurred in the first place in the individual given from the currently available information becomes:\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism can be assumed to cause hypercalcemia essentially 100% of the time (r = 1), so this independently calculated probability of primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) can be assumed to be the same as the probability of being a cause of the presentation:\n\nFor cancer, the same time-at-risk is assumed for simplicity, and let’s say that the incidence of cancer in the area is estimated at 1 in 250 per year, giving a population probability of cancer of:\n\nFor simplicity, let’s say that any association between a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism and risk of cancer is ignored, so the relative risk for the individual to have contracted cancer in the first place is similar to that of the population (RR = 1):\n\nHowever, hypercalcemia only occurs in, very approximately, 10% of cancers, (r = 0.1), so:\n\nThe probabilities that hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place by other candidate conditions can be calculated in a similar manner. However, for simplicity, let’s say that the probability that any of these would have occurred in the first place is calculated at 0.0005 in this example.\n\nFor the instance of there being no disease, the corresponding probability in the population is complementary to the sum of probabilities for other conditions:\n\nThe probability that the individual would be healthy in the first place can be assumed to be the same:\n\nThe rate at which the case of no abnormal condition still ends up in a measurement of serum calcium of being above the standard reference range (thereby classifying as hypercalcemia) is, by the definition of standard reference range, less than 2.5%. However, this probability can be further specified by considering how much the measurement deviates from the mean in the standard reference range. Let’s say that the serum calcium measurement was 1.30 mmol/L, which, with a standard reference range established at 1.05 to 1.25 mmol/L, corresponds to a standard score of 3 and a corresponding probability of 0.14% that such degree of hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place in the case of no abnormality:\n\nSubsequently, the probability that hypercalcemia would have resulted from no disease can be calculated as:\n\nThe probability that hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place in the individual can thus be calculated as:\n\nSubsequently, the probability that hypercalcemia is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) in the individual can be calculated as:\n\nSimilarly, the probability that hypercalcemia is caused by cancer in the individual can be calculated as:\n\nand for other candidate conditions:\n\nand the probability that there actually is no disease:\n\nFor clarification, these calculations are given as the table in the method description:\n\nThus, this method estimates that the probabilities that the hypercalcemia is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism, cancer, other conditions or no disease at all are 37.3%, 6.0%, 14.9% and 41.8%, respectively, which may be used in estimating further test indications.\n\nThis case is continued in the example of the method described in the next section.\nThe procedure of differential diagnosis can become extremely complex when fully taking additional tests and treatments into consideration. One method that is somewhat a tradeoff between being clinically perfect and being relatively simple to calculate is one that uses likelihood ratios to derive subsequent post-test likelihoods.\n\nThe initial likelihoods for each candidate condition can be estimated by various methods, such as:\n\nOne method of estimating likelihoods even after further tests uses likelihood ratios (which is derived from sensitivities and specificities) as a multiplication factor after each test or procedure. In an ideal world, sensitivities and specificities would be established for all tests for all possible pathological conditions. In reality, however, these parameters may only be established for one of the candidate conditions. Multiplying with likelihood ratios necessitates conversion of likelihoods from probabilities to \"odds in favor\" (hereafter simply termed “odds”) by:\n\nHowever, only the candidate conditions with known likelihood ratio need this conversion. After multiplication, conversion back to probability is calculated by:\n\nThe rest of the candidate conditions (for which there is no established likelihood ratio for the test at hand) can, for simplicity, be adjusted by subsequently multiplying all candidate conditions with a common factor to again yield a sum of 100%.\n\nThe resulting probabilities are used for estimating the indications for further medical tests, treatments or other actions. If there is an indication for an additional test, and it returns with a result, then the procedure is repeated using the likelihood ratio of the additional test. With updated probabilities for each of the candidate conditions, the indications for further tests, treatments or other actions changes as well, and so the procedure can be repeated until an \"end point\" where there no longer is any indication for currently performing further actions. Such an end point mainly occurs when one candidate condition becomes so certain that no test can be found that is powerful enough to change the relative probability-profile enough to motivate any change in further actions. Tactics for reaching such an end point with as few tests as possible includes making tests with high specificity for conditions of already outstandingly high-profile-relative probability, because the high likelihood ratio positive for such tests is very high, bringing all less likely conditions to relatively lower probabilities. Alternatively, tests with high sensitivity for competing candidate conditions have a high likelihood ratio negative, potentially bringing the probabilities for competing candidate conditions to negligible levels. If such negligible probabilities are achieved, the physician can rule out these conditions, and continue the differential diagnostic procedure with only the remaining candidate conditions.\n\nThis example continues for the same patient as in the example for the epidemiology-based method. As with the previous example of epidemiology-based method, this example case is made to demonstrate how this method is applied, but does not represent a guideline for handling similar real-world cases. Also, the example uses relatively specified numbers, while in reality, there are often just rough estimations. In this example, the probabilities for each candidate condition were established by an epidemiology-based method to be as follows:\n\nThese percentages could also have been established by experience at the particular clinic by knowing that these are the percentages for final diagnosis for people presenting to the clinic with hypercalcemia and having a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe condition of highest profile-relative probability (except “no disease”) is primary hyperparathyroidism (PH), but cancer is still of major concern, because if it is the actual causative condition for the hypercalcemia, then the choice of whether to treat or not likely means life or death for the patient, in effect potentially putting the indication at a similar level for further tests for both of these conditions.\n\nHere, let’s say that the physician considers the profile-relative probabilities of being of enough concern to indicate sending the patient a call for a doctor's visit, with an additional visit to the medical laboratory for an additional blood test complemented with further analyses, including parathyroid hormone for the suspicion of primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nFor simplicity, let’s say that the doctor first receives the blood test (in formulas abbreviated as “BT”) result for the parathyroid hormone analysis, and that it showed a parathyroid hormone level that is elevated relatively to what would be expected by the calcium level.\n\nSuch a constellation can be estimated to have a sensitivity of approximately 70% and a specificity of approximately 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism. This confers a likelihood ratio positive of 7 for primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe probability of primary hyperparathyroidism is now termed \"Pre-BT\" because it corresponds to before the blood test (Latin preposition \"prae\" means before). It was estimated at 37.3%, corresponding to an odds of 0.595. With the likelihood ratio positive of 7 for the blood test, the post-<nowiki>test</nowiki> odds is calculated as:\n\nwhere:\n\nAn Odds(PostBT) of 4.16 is again converted to the corresponding probability by:\n\nThe sum of the probabilities for the rest of the candidate conditions should therefore be:\n\nBefore the blood test for parathyroid hormone, the sum of their probabilities were:\n\nTherefore, to conform to a sum of 100% for all candidate conditions, each of the other candidates must be multiplied by a correcting factor:\n\nFor example, the probability of cancer after the test is calculated as:\n\nThe probabilities for each candidate conditions before and after the blood test are given in following table:\nThese “new” percentages, including a profile-relative probability of 80% for primary hyperparathyroidism, underlie any indications for further tests, treatments or other actions. In this case, let's say that the physician continues the plan for the patient to attend a doctor's visit for further checkup, especially focused at primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nA doctor's visit can, theoretically, be regarded as a series of tests, including both questions in a medical history as well as components of a physical examination, where the post-test probability of a previous test can be used as the pre-test probability of the next. The indications for choosing the next test is dynamically influenced by the results of previous tests.\n\nLet's say that the patient in this example is revealed to have at least some of the symptoms and signs of depression, bone pain, joint pain or constipation of more severerity than what would be expected by the hypercalcemia itself, supporting the suspicion of primary hyperparathyroidism, and let's say that the likelihood ratios for the tests, when multiplied together, roughly results in a product of 6 for primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe presence of unspecific pathologic symptoms and signs in the history and examination are often concurrently indicative of cancer as well, and let's say that the tests gave an overall likelihood ratio estimated at 1.5 for cancer. For other conditions, as well as the instance of not having any disease at all, let’s say that it’s unknown how they are affected by the tests at hand, as often happens in reality. This gives the following results for the history and physical examination (abbreviated as P&E):\n\nThese probabilities after the history and examination may make the physician confident enough to plan the patient for surgery for a parathyroidectomy to resect the affected tissue.\n\nAt this point, the probability of \"other conditions\" is so low that the physician cannot think of any test for them that could make a difference that would be substantial enough to form an indication for such a test, and the physician thereby practically regards \"other conditions\" as ruled out, in this case not primarily by any specific test for such other conditions that were negative, but rather by the absence of positive tests so far.\n\nFor \"cancer\", the cutoff at which to confidently regard it as ruled out may be more stringent because of severe consequences of missing it, so the physician may consider that at least a histopathologic examination of the resected tissue is indicated.\n\nThis case is continued in the example of \"Combinations\" in corresponding section below.\n\nThe validity of both the initial estimation of probabilities by epidemiology and further workup by likelihood ratios are dependent of inclusion of candidate conditions that are responsible for as large part as possible of the probability of having developed the condition, and it is clinically important to include those where relatively fast initiation of therapy is most likely to result in greatest benefit. If an important candidate condition is missed, no method of differential diagnosis will supply the correct conclusion. The need to find more candidate conditions for inclusion increases with increasing severity of the presentation itself. For example, if the only presentation is a deviating laboratory parameter and all common harmful underlying conditions have been ruled out, then it may be acceptable to stop finding more candidate conditions, but this would much more likely be unacceptable if the presentation would have been severe pain.\n\nIf two conditions get high post-test probabilities, especially if the sum of the probabilities for conditions with known likelihood ratios become higher than 100%, then the actual condition is a combination of the two. In such cases, that combined condition can be added to the list of candidate conditions, and the calculations should start over from the beginning.\n\nTo continue the example used above, let's say that the history and physical examination was indicative of cancer as well, with a likelihood ratio of 3, giving an Odds(PostH&E) of 0.057, corresponding to a P(PostH&E) of 5.4%. This would correspond to a “Sum of known P(PostH&E)” of 101.5%. This is an indication for considering a combination of primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer, such as, in this case, a parathyroid hormone-producing parathyroid carcinoma. A recalculation may therefore be needed, with the first two conditions being separated into “primary hyperparathyroidism without cancer”, “cancer without primary hyperparathyroidism” as well as “combined primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer”, and likelihood ratios being applied to each condition separately. In this case, however, tissue has already been resected, wherein a histopathologic examination can be performed that includes the possibility of parathyroid carcinoma in the examination (which may entail appropriate sample staining). \nLet’s say that the histopathologic examination confirms primary hyperparathyroidism, but also showed a malignant pattern. By an initial method by epidemiology, the incidence of parathyroid carcinoma is estimated at about 1 in 6 million people per year, giving a very low probability before taking any tests into consideration. In comparison, the probability that a non-malignant primary hyperparathyroidism would have occurred at the same time as an unrelated non-carcinoma cancer that presents with malignant cells in the parathyroid gland is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the two. The resultant probability is, however, much smaller than the 1 in 6 million. Therefore, the probability of parathyroid carcinoma may still be close to 100% after histopathologic examination despite the low probability of occurring in the first place.\n\nMachine differential diagnosis is the use of computer software to partly or fully make a differential diagnosis. It may be regarded as an application of artificial intelligence.\n\nMany studies demonstrate improvement of quality of care and reduction of medical errors by using such decision support systems. Some of these systems are designed for a specific medical problem such as schizophrenia, Lyme disease or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Others such as ESAGIL, Iliad, QMR, DiagnosisPro, VisualDx, Isabel, ZeroMD, DxMate, Symptoma, and Physician Cognition are designed to cover all major clinical and diagnostic findings to assist physicians with faster and more accurate diagnosis.\n\nHowever, these tools all still require advanced medical skills to rate symptoms and choose additional tests to deduce the probabilities of different diagnoses. Machine differential diagnosis is also currently unable to diagnose multiple concurrent disorders. Thus, non-professionals should still see a health care provider for a proper diagnosis.\n\nThe method of differential diagnosis was first suggested for use in the diagnosis of mental disorders by Emil Kraepelin. It is more systematic than the old-fashioned method of diagnosis by \"gestalt\" (impression).\n\n'Differential diagnosis' is also used more loosely, to refer simply to a list of the most common causes of a given symptom, to a list of disorders similar to a given disorder, or to such lists when they are annotated with advice on how to narrow the list down (the book 'French's Index of Differential Diagnosis', , is an example). Thus, a differential diagnosis in this sense is medical information specially organized to aid in diagnosis.\n\nMethods similar to those of differential diagnostic processes in medicine are also used by biological taxonomists to identify and classify organisms, living and extinct. For example, after finding an unknown species, there can first be a listing of all potential species, followed by ruling out of one by one until, optimally, only one potential choice remains.\nSimilar procedures may be used by plant and maintenance engineers, automotive mechanics, and used to be used in diagnosing faulty electronic circuitry.\n\n"}

The family moved to Kristiansand in 1901. He was a nephew of Johannes Skar and Christopher Bruun, a brother of Bjarne and Sigmund Skard and a half-brother of Olav and Torfinn Skard. When Sigmund Skard married Åse Gruda Skard, Åsa became Eiliv's sister-in-law.\n\nIn 1940 he married teacher Sigrid Nordang (1903–1988). They had met in Gudbrandsdalen in the same year.\n\nHe finished his secondary education at Kristiansand Cathedral School in 1916, and graduated from the Royal Frederick University in 1922. He worked at the secondary schools in Hornnes from 1922 to 1924 and Orkdal 1925 to 1929. He was a Latin teacher at the university from 1929, having specialized in classical philology during studies in Germany, Italy and Greece. He took the dr.philos. degree in 1931 on the thesis \"Zwei religiös-politische Begriffe. Euergetes. Concordia\". When writing in Norwegian, he used the Nynorsk form. In 1934 he was promoted to professor of classical philology at the Royal Frederick University (from 1939: the University of Oslo).\n\nIn the interwar period Skard marked himself as an opponent of Fascism, first and foremost as a follower of the Oxford Group. When Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Skard participated in the fighting in Gudbrandsdalen. Germany won, but one of many civil protests ensued when the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943. In retaliation, the authorities arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students. The staff Johannes Andenæs, Bjørn Føyn, Johan Christian Schreiner, Harald Krabbe Schjelderup, Anatol Heintz, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Carl Jacob Arnholm, Endre Berner and Eiliv Skard were sent to Grini concentration camp. Skard was first incarcerated at Bredtveit from 15 October to 22 November, then at Berg until 8 December, then at Grini until 5 May 1945. An exception came in the last winter, when Skard spent a month at Victoria Terrasse.\n\nAfter the war Skard returned as professor, and was dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1947 to 1952. On 1 February 1948 he became professor of the history of ideas with emphasis on the Antiquity. He edited the journal \"Symbolae Osloenses\", and his most notable books were \"Filosofien i oldtiden\" (1951) and the three-volume anthology \"Vestens tenkere\" (1962) which he edited together with Andreas Hofgaard Winsnes. He died in September 1978 in Oslo.\n"}

{"id": "14594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14594", "title": "Internet troll", "text": "Internet troll\n\nIn Internet slang, a troll () is a person who starts quarrels or upsets people on the Internet to distract and sow discord\nby posting inflammatory and digressive, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into displaying emotional responses\nand normalizing tangential discussion, whether for the troll's amusement or a specific gain.\n\nBoth the noun and the verb form of \"troll\" is associated with Internet discourse. However, the word has also been used more widely. Media attention in recent years has equated trolling with online harassment. For example, the mass media have used \"troll\" to mean \"a person who defaces Internet tribute sites with the aim of causing grief to families\". In addition, depictions of trolling have been included in popular fictional works, such as the HBO television program \"The Newsroom\", in which a main character encounters harassing persons online and tries to infiltrate their circles by posting negative sexual comments.\n\nApplication of the term \"troll\" is subjective. Some readers may characterize a post as \"trolling\", while others may regard the same post as a legitimate contribution to the discussion, even if controversial. Like any pejorative term, it can be used as an \"ad hominem\" attack, suggesting a negative motivation.\n\nAs noted in an \"OS News\" article titled \"Why People Troll and How to Stop Them\" (25 January 2012), \"The traditional definition of trolling includes intent. That is, trolls purposely disrupt forums. This definition is too narrow. Whether someone intends to disrupt a thread or not, the results are the same if they do.\" Others have addressed the same issue, e.g., Claire Hardaker, in her Ph.D. thesis \"Trolling in asynchronous computer-mediated communication: From user discussions to academic definitions.\" Popular recognition of the existence (and prevalence) of non-deliberate, \"accidental trolls\", has been documented widely, in sources as diverse as Nicole Sullivan's keynote speech at the 2012 Fluent Conference, titled \"Don't Feed the Trolls\" Gizmodo, online opinions on the subject written by Silicon Valley executives and comics.\n\nRegardless of the circumstances, controversial posts may attract a particularly strong response from those unfamiliar with the robust dialogue found in some online, rather than physical, communities. Experienced participants in online forums know that the most effective way to discourage a troll is usually to ignore it, because responding tends to encourage trolls to continue disruptive postshence the often-seen warning: \"Please do not feed the trolls\".\n\nThe \"trollface\" is an image occasionally used to indicate trolling in Internet culture.\n\nAt times the word can be abused to refer to anyone with controversial opinions they disagree with. Such usage goes against the ordinary meaning of troll in multiple ways. While psychologists have determined that the dark triad traits are common among Internet trolls, some observers claim trolls don't actually believe the controversial views they claim. Farhad Manjoo criticises this view, noting that if the person really is trolling, they are more intelligent than their critics would believe.\n\nThere are competing theories of where and when \"troll\" was first used in Internet slang, with numerous unattested accounts of BBS and UseNet origins in the early 1980s or before.\n\nThe English noun \"troll\" in the standard sense of ugly dwarf or giant dates to 1610 and comes from the Old Norse word \"troll\" meaning giant or demon. The word evokes the trolls of Scandinavian folklore and children's tales: antisocial, quarrelsome and slow-witted creatures which make life difficult for travellers.\n\nIn modern English usage, \"trolling\" may describe the fishing technique of slowly dragging a lure or baited hook from a moving boat whereas \"trawling\" describes the generally commercial act of dragging a fishing net. Early non-Internet slang use of \"trolling\" can be found in the military: by 1972 the term \"trolling for MiGs\" was documented in use by US Navy pilots in Vietnam. It referred to use of \"...decoys, with the mission of drawing...fire away...\"\n\nThe contemporary use of the term is said to have appeared on the Internet in the late 1980s, but the earliest known attestation according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is in 1992.\n\nThe context of the quote cited in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" sets the origin in Usenet in the early 1990s as in the phrase \"trolling for newbies\", as used in \"alt.folklore.urban\" (AFU). Commonly, what is meant is a relatively gentle inside joke by veteran users, presenting questions or topics that had been so overdone that only a new user would respond to them earnestly. For example, a veteran of the group might make a post on the common misconception that glass flows over time. Long-time readers would both recognize the poster's name and know that the topic had been discussed repeatedly, but new subscribers to the group would not realize, and would thus respond. These types of trolls served as a practice to identify group insiders. This definition of trolling, considerably narrower than the modern understanding of the term, was considered a positive contribution. One of the most notorious AFU trollers, David Mikkelson, went on to create the urban folklore website Snopes.com.\n\nBy the late 1990s, \"alt.folklore.urban\" had such heavy traffic and participation that trolling of this sort was frowned upon. Others expanded the term to include the practice of playing a seriously misinformed or deluded user, even in newsgroups where one was not a regular; these were often attempts at humor rather than provocation. The noun \"troll\" usually referred to an act of trolling – or to the resulting discussion – rather than to the author, though some posts punned on the dual meaning of \"troll.\"\n\nIn Chinese, trolling is referred to as \"bái mù\" (), which can be straightforwardly explained as \"eyes without pupils\", in the sense that whilst the pupil of the eye is used for vision, the white section of the eye cannot see, and trolling involves blindly talking nonsense over the Internet, having total disregard to sensitivities or being oblivious to the situation at hand, akin to having eyes without pupils. An alternative term is \"bái làn\" (), which describes a post completely nonsensical and full of folly made to upset others, and derives from a Taiwanese slang term for the male genitalia, where genitalia that is pale white in colour represents that someone is young, and thus foolish. Both terms originate from Taiwan, and are also used in Hong Kong and mainland China. Another term, \"xiǎo bái\" () is a derogatory term for both \"bái mù\" and \"bái làn\" that is used on anonymous posting Internet forums. Another common term for a troll used in mainland China is \"pēn zi\" ().\n\nIn Japanese, means \"fishing\" and refers to intentionally misleading posts whose only purpose is to get the readers to react, i.e. get trolled. means \"laying waste\" and can also be used to refer to simple spamming.\n\nIn Icelandic, \"þurs\" (a thurs) or \"tröll\" (a troll) may refer to trolls, the verbs \"þursa\" (to troll) or \"þursast\" (to be trolling, to troll about) may be used.\n\nIn Korean, \"nak-si\" (낚시) means \"fishing\", refers to Internet trolling attempts, as well as purposefully misleading post titles. A person who recognizes the troll after having responded (or, in case of a post title \"nak-si\", having read the actual post) would often refer to himself as a caught fish.\n\nIn Portuguese, more commonly in its Brazilian variant, (produced in most of Brazil as spelling pronunciation) is the usual term to denote Internet trolls (examples of common derivate terms are \"trollismo\" or \"trollagem\", \"trolling\", and the verb \"trollar\", \"to troll\", which entered popular use), but an older expression, used by those which want to avoid anglicisms or slangs, is \"\" to denote trolling behavior, and \"pombos enxadristas\" (literally, \"chessplayer pigeons\") or simply \"pombos\" are the terms used to name the trolls. The terms are explained by an adage or popular saying: \"Arguing with \"fulano\" (i.e., John Doe) is the same as playing chess with a pigeon: it defecates on the table, drops the pieces and simply flies off, claiming victory.\"\n\nIn Thai, the term \"krian\" (เกรียน) has been adopted to address Internet trolls. According to the Royal Institute of Thailand, the term, which literally refers to a closely cropped hairstyle worn by schoolboys in Thailand, is from the behaviour of these schoolboys who usually gather to play online games and, during which, make annoying, disruptive, impolite, or unreasonable expressions. The term \"top krian\" (ตบเกรียน; \"slap a cropped head\") refers to the act of posting intellectual replies to refute and cause the messages of Internet trolls to be perceived as unintelligent.\n\nEarly incidents of trolling were considered to be the same as flaming, but this has changed with modern usage by the news media to refer to the creation of any content that targets another person. The Internet dictionary NetLingo suggests there are four grades of trolling: playtime trolling, tactical trolling, strategic trolling, and domination trolling.\nThe relationship between trolling and flaming was observed in open-access forums in California, on a series of modem-linked computers. \"CommuniTree\" was begun in 1978 but was closed in 1982 when accessed by high school teenagers, becoming a ground for trashing and abuse. Some psychologists have suggested that flaming would be caused by deindividuation or decreased self-evaluation: the anonymity of online postings would lead to disinhibition amongst individuals Others have suggested that although flaming and trolling is often unpleasant, it may be a form of normative behavior that expresses the social identity of a certain user group\nAccording to Tom Postmes, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the universities of Exeter, England, and Groningen, The Netherlands, and the author of \"Individuality and the Group\", who has studied online behavior for 20 years, \"Trolls aspire to violence, to the level of trouble they can cause in an environment. They want it to kick off. They want to promote antipathetic emotions of disgust and outrage, which morbidly gives them a sense of pleasure.\"\n\nThe practice of trolling has been documented by a number of academics as early as the 1990s. This included Steven Johnson in 1997 in the book \"Interface Culture\", and a paper by Judith Donath in 1999. Donath's paper outlines the ambiguity of identity in a disembodied \"virtual community\" such as Usenet:\n\nDonath provides a concise overview of identity deception games which trade on the confusion between physical and epistemic community:\n\nTrolls can be costly in several ways. A troll can disrupt the discussion on a newsgroup, disseminate bad advice, and damage the feeling of trust in the newsgroup community. Furthermore, in a group that has become sensitized to trollingwhere the rate of deception is highmany honestly naïve questions may be quickly rejected as trollings. This can be quite off-putting to the new user who upon venturing a first posting is immediately bombarded with angry accusations. Even if the accusation is unfounded, being branded a troll is quite damaging to one's online reputation.\n\nSusan Herring and colleagues in \"Searching for Safety Online: Managing 'Trolling' in a Feminist Forum\" point out the difficulty inherent in monitoring trolling and maintaining freedom of speech in online communities: \"harassment often arises in spaces known for their freedom, lack of censure, and experimental nature\".\nFree speech may lead to tolerance of trolling behavior, complicating the members' efforts to maintain an open, yet supportive discussion area, especially for sensitive topics such as race, gender, and sexuality.\n\nIn an effort to reduce uncivil behavior by increasing accountability, many web sites (e.g. Reuters, Facebook, and Gizmodo) now require commenters to register their names and e-mail addresses.\n\nInvestigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson is one of several in the media who has reported on the trend for organizations to utilize trolls to manipulate public opinion as part and parcel of an astroturfing initiative. Teams of sponsored trolls, sometimes referred to as sockpuppet armies, swarm a site to overwhelm any honest discourse and denigrate any who disagree with them.\nA 2012 Pew Center on the States presentation on \"effective messaging\" included two examples of social media posts by a recently launched \"rapid response team\" dedicated to promoting fluoridation of community water supplies. That same presentation also emphasized changing the topic of conversation as a winning strategy.\n\nA 2016 study by Harvard political scientist Gary King reported that the Chinese government's 50 Cent Party creates 440 million pro-government social media posts per year. The report said that government employees were paid to create pro-government posts around the time of national holidays to avoid mass political protests. The Chinese Government ran an editorial in the state-funded \"Global Times\" defending censorship and 50 Cent Party trolls.\n\nA 2016 study for the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence on hybrid warfare notes that the Ukrainian crisis \"demonstrated how fake identities and accounts were used to disseminate narratives through social media, blogs, and web commentaries in order to manipulate, harass, or deceive opponents.\" The NATO report describes that a \"Wikipedia troll\" uses a type of message design where a troll does not add \"emotional value\" to reliable \"essentially true\" information in re-posts, but presents it \"in the wrong context, intending the audience to draw false conclusions.\" For example, information, without context, from Wikipedia about the military history of the United States \"becomes value-laden if it is posted in the comment section of an article criticizing Russia for its military actions and interests in Ukraine. The Wikipedia troll is 'tricky', because in terms of actual text, the information is true, but the way it is expressed gives it a completely different meaning to its readers.\"\n\nUnlike \"classic trolls,\" Wikipedia trolls \"have no emotional input, they just supply misinformation\" and are one of \"the most dangerous\" as well as one of \"the most effective trolling message designs.\" Even among people who are \"emotionally immune to aggressive messages\" and apolitical, \"training in critical thinking\" is needed, according to the NATO report, because \"they have relatively blind trust in Wikipedia sources and are not able to filter information that comes from platforms they consider authoritative.\" While Russian-language hybrid trolls use the Wikipedia troll message design to promote anti-Western sentiment in comments, they \"mostly attack aggressively to maintain emotional attachment to issues covered in articles.\" Discussions about topics other than international sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis \"attracted very aggressive trolling\" and became polarized according to the NATO report, which \"suggests that in subjects in which there is little potential for re-educating audiences, emotional harm is considered more effective\" for pro-Russian Latvian-language trolls.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported in late October 2018 that Saudi Arabia used an online army of Twitter trolls to harass the late Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi and other critics of the Saudi government.\n\nResearcher Ben Radford wrote about the phenomenon of clowns in history and modern day in his book \"Bad Clowns\" and found that bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They do not dress up as traditional clowns but, for their own amusement, they tease and exploit \"human foibles\" in order to speak the \"truth\" and gain a reaction. Like clowns in make-up, Internet trolls hide behind \"anonymous accounts and fake usernames.\" In their eyes they are the trickster and are performing for a nameless audience via the Internet.\n\nA \"concern troll\" is a false flag pseudonym created by a user whose actual point of view is opposed to the one that the troll claims to hold. The concern troll posts in Web forums devoted to its declared point of view and attempts to sway the group's actions or opinions while claiming to share their goals, but with professed \"concerns\". The goal is to sow fear, uncertainty and doubt within the group. This is a particular case of sockpuppeting.\n\nAn example of this occurred in 2006 when Tad Furtado, a staffer for then-Congressman Charles Bass (R-NH), was caught posing as a \"concerned\" supporter of Bass's opponent, Democrat Paul Hodes, on several liberal New Hampshire blogs, using the pseudonyms \"IndieNH\" or \"IndyNH\". \"IndyNH\" expressed concern that Democrats might just be wasting their time or money on Hodes, because Bass was unbeatable. Hodes eventually won the election.\n\nAlthough the term \"concern troll\" originated in discussions of online behavior, it now sees increasing use to describe similar behaviors that take place offline. For example, James Wolcott of \"Vanity Fair\" accused a conservative \"New York Daily News\" columnist of \"concern troll\" behavior in his efforts to downplay the Mark Foley scandal. Wolcott links what he calls concern trolls to what Saul Alinsky calls \"Do-Nothings\", giving a long quote from Alinsky on the Do-Nothings' method and effects:\n\n\"The Hill\" published an op-ed piece by Markos Moulitsas of the liberal blog Daily Kos titled \"Dems: Ignore 'Concern Trolls'\". The concern trolls in question were not Internet participants but rather Republicans offering public advice and warnings to the Democrats. The author defines \"concern trolling\" as \"offering a poisoned apple in the form of advice to political opponents that, if taken, would harm the recipient\". Concern trolls just use a different type of bait than the more stereotypical troll in their attempts to manipulate participants and disrupt conversations.\n\nWhile many webmasters and forum administrators consider trolls a scourge on their sites, some websites welcome them. For example, a \"The New York Times\" article discussed troll activity at 4chan and at Encyclopedia Dramatica, which it described as \"an online compendium of troll humor and troll lore\". 4chan's /b/ board is recognized as \"one of the Internet's most infamous and active trolling hotspots.\" This site and others are often used as a base to troll against sites that their members can not normally post on. These trolls feed off the reactions of their victims because \"their agenda is to take delight in causing trouble\".\n\nMainstream media outlets have focused their attention on the willingness of some Internet users to go to extreme lengths to participate in organized psychological harassment.\n\nIn February 2010, the Australian government became involved after users defaced the Facebook tribute pages of murdered children Trinity Bates and Elliott Fletcher. Australian communications minister Stephen Conroy decried the attacks, committed mainly by 4chan users, as evidence of the need for greater Internet regulation, stating, \"This argument that the Internet is some mystical creation that no laws should apply to, that is a recipe for anarchy and the wild west.\" Facebook responded by strongly urging administrators to be aware of ways to ban users and remove inappropriate content from Facebook pages. In 2012, the \"Daily Telegraph\" started a campaign to take action against \"Twitter trolls\", who abuse and threaten users. Several high-profile Australians including Charlotte Dawson, Robbie Farah, Laura Dundovic, and Ray Hadley have been victims of this phenomenon.\n\nNewslaundry covered the phenomenon of \"Twitter trolling\" in its \"Criticles\". It has also been characterising Twitter trolls in its weekly podcasts.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, contributions made to the Internet are covered by the Malicious Communications Act 1988 as well as Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, under which jail sentences were, until 2015, limited to a maximum of six months. In October 2014, the UK's Justice Secretary, Chris Grayling, said that \"Internet trolls\" would face up to two years in jail, under measures in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill that extend the maximum sentence and time limits for bringing prosecutions. The House of Lords Select Committee on Communications had earlier recommended against creating a specific offence of trolling. Sending messages which are \"grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\" is an offence whether they are received by the intended recipient or not. Several people have been imprisoned in the UK for online harassment.\n\nTrolls of the testimonial page of Georgia Varley faced no prosecution due to misunderstandings of the legal system in the wake of the term trolling being popularized. In October 2012, a twenty-year-old man was jailed for twelve weeks for posting offensive jokes to a support group for friends and family of April Jones.\n\nOn 31 March 2010, NBC's \"Today\" ran a segment detailing the deaths of three separate adolescent girls and trolls' subsequent reactions to their deaths. Shortly after the suicide of high school student Alexis Pilkington, anonymous posters began performing organized psychological harassment across various message boards, referring to Pilkington as a \"suicidal slut\", and posting graphic images on her Facebook memorial page. The segment also included an exposé of a 2006 accident, in which an eighteen-year-old fatally crashed her father's car into a highway pylon; trolls emailed her grieving family the leaked pictures of her mutilated corpse (see Nikki Catsouras photographs controversy).\n\nIn 2007, the media was fooled by trollers into believing that students were consuming a drug called Jenkem, purportedly made of human waste. A user named Pickwick on TOTSE posted pictures implying that he was inhaling this drug. Major news corporations such as Fox News Channel reported the story and urged parents to warn their children about this drug. Pickwick's pictures of Jenkem were fake and the pictures did not actually feature human waste.\n\nIn August 2012, the subject of trolling was featured on the HBO television series \"The Newsroom\". The character of Neal Sampat encounters harassing individuals online, particularly looking at 4chan, and he ends up choosing to post negative comments himself on an economics-related forum. The attempt by the character to infiltrate trolls' inner circles attracted debate from media reviewers critiquing the series.\n\nThe publication of the 2015 non-fiction book \"The Dark Net: Inside the Digital Underworld\" by Jamie Bartlett, a journalist and a representative of the British think tank Demos, attracted some attention for its depiction of misunderstood sections of the Internet, describing interactions on encrypted sites such as those accessible with the software Tor. Detailing trolling-related groups and the harassment created by them, Bartlett advocated for greater awareness of them and monitoring of their activities. Professor Matthew Wisnioski wrote for \"The Washington Post\" that a \"league of trolls, anarchists, perverts and drug dealers is at work building a digital world beyond the Silicon Valley offices where our era's best and brightest have designed a Facebook-friendly\" surface and agreed with Bartlett that the activities of trolls go back decades to the Usenet \"flame wars\" of the 1990s and even earlier.\n\nAs reported on 8 April 1999, investors became victims of trolling via an online financial discussion regarding PairGain, a telephone equipment company based in California. Trolls operating in the stock's Yahoo Finance chat room posted a fabricated Bloomberg News article stating that an Israeli telecom company could potentially acquire PairGain. As a result, PairGain's stock jumped by 31%. However, the stock promptly crashed after the reports were identified as false.\n\nSo-called Gold Membership trolling originated in 2007 on 4chan boards, when users posted fake images claiming to offer upgraded 4chan account privileges; without a \"Gold\" account, one could not view certain content. This turned out to be a hoax designed to fool board members, especially newcomers. It was copied and became an Internet meme. In some cases, this type of troll has been used as a scam, most notably on Facebook, where fake Facebook Gold Account upgrade ads have proliferated in order to link users to dubious websites and other content.\n\nThe case of \"Zeran v. America Online, Inc.\" resulted primarily from trolling. Six days after the Oklahoma City bombing, anonymous users posted advertisements for shirts celebrating the bombing on AOL message boards, claiming that the shirts could be obtained by contacting Mr. Kenneth Zeran. The posts listed Zeran's address and home phone number. Zeran was subsequently harassed.\n\nAnti-Scientology protests by Anonymous, commonly known as Project Chanology, are sometimes labeled as \"trolling\" by media such as \"Wired\", and the participants sometimes explicitly self-identify as \"trolls\".\n\nNeo-Nazi website \"The Daily Stormer\" orchestrates what it calls a \"Troll Army\", and has encouraged trolling of Jewish MP Luciana Berger and Muslim activist Mariam Veiszadeh.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1915, Jabbarli graduated from high school and studied electromechanics at Baku Polytechnicum for the next 5 years. In 1920 he was admitted to Azerbaijan State University to study applied medicine but due to his lack of interest soon switched to Oriental studies. In 1923, he started attending lectures at a local theatre to fulfill his interest in drama.\n\nJafar Jabbarli died at the age of 35 of heart failure and was buried at the Alley of Honor. The national film studio, \"Azerbaijanfilm\", a street and a subway station in Baku are named after him.\n\nOn 22 May 1985 the museum \"Jafar Jabbarli memorial house\" was opened. It is located in the house on I. Gutgashinli steet 44 (former G.

In the following years, he wrote more than 20 plays, as well as poems, essays, short stories, and articles. His works were very much influenced by the 1920s propaganda of Communist glory and celebrated appropriate themes such as equality, labour, education, cosmopolitanism, emancipation of women, cultural shifts, etc. Jabbarli's major accomplishment in introducing European plays to average Azerbaijanis was translating William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" into Azeri in 1925 and directing it at the Azerbaijan Drama Theatre a year later.\n\nJafar Jabbarli is considered the founder of screenwriting in Azerbaijan. Two of his plays, \"Sevil\" and \"Almaz\", both written in 1928, were made into films in 1929 and 1936 respectively. Both focused on the theme of the role of women, their oppression, struggle, and ultimately, victory over dated patriarchal traditions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33662867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33662867", "title": "Kove language", "text": "Kove language\n\nKove is one of the Austronesian languages of New Britain which is spoken by the people of Papua New Guinea. The language is found in 18 villages with their populations totaling 9,000 people; however, most of the people are unfamiliar with the language. Instead of using the Kove language, many of them are using Tok Pisin as their daily language.\nAlthough in the past the Kove people had contact with foreign languages as a result of trading, the location where they lived was isolated enough that they maintained Kove as their daily language. This is caused by interacting with more people than they used to because of the increase in the transportation. However, the younger generation, people who are below fifty, started to use Tok Pisin as their daily language. In addition, the education language that are used in the schools is not Kove, except one school just recently changed to Kove, but this does not mean that the student will use Kove outside of the class. Also, some Kove people are married to non-Kove speaker and they use other language in their daily life rather than Kove. As a result, their child will learn the other language as their first language.\nThere are three dialects where Kove is spoken. These three dialects are called East Kove, Central Kove, and West Kove. The dialect that are used by the Central Kove is to be considered as the standard Kove. This is because the central of the Kove area is the place where the ancestor have first arrived. Additionally, it is the dialect that is closest to the original Kove language. In fact, the other two dialects, East Kove and West Kove, has been changed slightly due to the languages around them.\nThe Kove independent pronouns are given in the following table.\nThe pronominal system for Kove is somewhat different from the other Oceanic languages. The similarities that Kove and other oceanic languages have been using first person, second person, and third person. They also separate the inclusive and the exclusive. Also, \"gender is not encoded\" stated by Hiroko. However, unlike the other language of the Oceanic, Kove only uses singular and plural for numbers. The pronominal system for Kove is separated into four functions. These four functions are independent, subject marker, object, and possessive.\nThe order of the grammar pattern that is used in Kove is SV and AYO, \"where S represents an intransitive subject, A a transitive subject, V a verb, and O a direct object\", stated by Hiroko.\nKove consonant may be changed anytime due to the interaction with the language of Tok Pisin and English. You can also combine all the consonants with the vowels that they have.\n\nIn Kove there are five vowels. The lips will round to produce the vowels /u/ and /o/. For vowels /i/, /e/, and /a/ the lips will not be rounded. Vowels can be at the beginning of the word or at the end of the word. Also, the same two vowels cannot be used together. For example, using the vowels /ii/ together is not allowed; however, there is one word that is uses the same two vowels which is /ee/ \"yes.\" This example is the only case where two of the same vowels can appear next to each other.\n\nFurthermore, if the vowels are followed by a velar nasal ng, then it will become a negative tense, except the vowel a.\nSome of the elementary schools in Kove just recently used an orthography \"that was established by elementary school teachers who were neither native speakers of Kove nor trained in linguistics\" as stated by Hiroko. However, these teachers are unfamiliar with the system.\n\nThere are two different types of stress in Kove, one is primary and the other is secondary. \"Primary stress always falls on the penultimate syllable\" and \" secondary stress falls on every second syllable to the left of the syllable receiving primary stress,\" claimed Hiroko.\nJust like the other language in Oceanic, Kove has many word that are reduplicated. There are three type of reduplication in Kove. The first one which is full reduplication. The examples for this type of duplication is tama \"father\" is reduplicated to tamatama \"father\" in Kove. Also, ani \"eat\" reduplicated to aniani \"be eating\". The second type of reduplication is leftward. For examples, pau \"new\" is reduplicated to papau \"new\" and tari \"younger parallel sibling and cousin\" reduplicated to tatari \"younger parallel siblings and cousins\". The third type of reduplication is rightward but, this type of reduplication is rarely used in Kove. \nThe language Kove have also borrow words from other languages, for example, the language of Austronesian like Anem, Papuan. This is because when they are trading with other people, they will apparently saw new things. In this case, they will borrow the other language word and combine with their own language to named it. Some examples that the language of Kove have borrowed the words from other languages are \"tavila \"large wooden bowl for pounding taro\", amouru \"rain tree\", ahila \"small-leafed rattan originating in the bush\", rodya \"short and light yellow tapioca\", said Hiroko. And as the time passes, these words will be known as Kove language. This type of situation is getting more commonly in today's live. Due to the increasing of interaction with the outside world and easier of transportation, Kove people will eventually know more things. This means that they have to borrow the word from other language to name it. In fact, due to the language of Tok Pisin that the Kove people has used as their daily language, many new things are named using Tok Pisin. For examples, car, airplane, paper, money, and many more are named using the Tok Pisin language instead of Kove language. \nThe language of Kove has three word classes: open lexical classes, closed lexical classes, and grammatical classes. Lexical class is also known as the part of speech and \"grammatical words or morphemes are elements shared in the grammatical structure of clauses,\" claimed Hiroko. Which includes the nouns and the verbs. On the other hand, closed lexical classes includes adjectives, adverbs, and cardinal numerals. The grammatical classes includes adpositions, articles, causative marker, serialed verb unifier, conjunctions, demonstratives, intransitive marker, locative demonstratives, nominalizers, particles, possessive markers, pronouns, reciprocal marker, tense, aspect, mood markers, and all other element that are not included in the other two classes. \n"}

{"id": "44490222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44490222", "title": "Language power", "text": "Language power\n\nLanguage power (LP) is a measure of one’s ability to communicate effectively in a given language, specifically one that is not native to the speaker.\n\nCurrent instructional programs throughout the world continue to attempt to teach enrollees how to communicate in a second language – yet they struggle. They struggle because existing methodologies do not typically result in the learner being able to communicate effectively in the new language. The root cause of this global problem is that learners do not reach a sufficient level of “native-ness” in their speech which hurts the learner’s career achievements - despite numerous attempts at language instruction policy and practice reform. Language Power consists of two key components: 1) an ability to speak and be understood, and 2) an ability to listen and understand. Individuals with strong language power possess the ability to communicate effectively in a social environment. When non-native speakers engage in oral communication, native speakers of that language recognize sufficiently well-formed speech, in that it is satisfactorily ‘native’ or sufficiently close to what they know as ‘their language’ in order to be completely understood. When non-native speakers listen to a econdary language, they need to be capable of interpreting and processing words that are spoken at real world rates of speech in the manner spoken by native speakers of that language.\n\nEach year in the United States, many students are required to learn a language other than English in their educational careers. Often, after years of study and quite likely earning passing grades on final and college entrance exams such as the ACTFL (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language) Oral Proficiency Interview, most students cannot speak at a level that will be understood or can they understand basic everyday exchanges at conversational speed in the language’s native country, as one would encounter when watching television or listening to the radio.\n\nLanguage is taught to a level of certain academic competencies, further referred to as academic knowledge (AK): 1) grammatical competence to include proper use of grammar, extensive vocabulary knowledge, and appropriate pronunciation, 2) sociolinguistic competence, which is the proper use of words and grammar depending on social situations and knowledge of cultural politeness, 3) discourse competence – the ability to use the language in various settings, such as a debate or neighborhood gathering, and 4) strategic competence, the ability to use verbal and non-verbal means to communicate, especially during challenging situations.\n\nAcademic knowledge measures are far more prevalent and comprise the majority items we see in formal language assessment. Also known as \"drill and kill\", typical instructional programs continue to focus on rote memorization of vocabulary and grammatical structure instead of practical use of a language – a deficiency in \"humanization\" of course material. Furthermore, there is a lack of appropriate materials in an academic setting, driving teachers to create home-made course materials for class. A study by Houston (2005) demonstrated that students learning Spanish valued “survival-skills” learning (ability to function in a social environment) more than \"academic\" knowledge of a language. Moreover, teachers report lack of time and resources to practice a language within the classroom to strengthen competency.\n\nVocabulary items are quite common and take many forms. From simple flash card type exercises to more complex matching games and standard multiple choice, over the years test makers have employed a variety of ways to test the student’s understanding of the meaning of a single word. This item type may be useful to increase the total number of words a student understands, however, it is not an indicator of communication competency unless the item combines either identification of real world audio or oral production that connects the speaker to the real world.\nSecond only to vocabulary items in number are grammar items. These items are typically found in written form, on paper or on the computer screen, and typically present the student with a multiple choice selection to fill-in-the-blank or complete/replace language items in a sentence with the response that is grammatically correct. \n\nThe decision to hire someone for a company position may be, to some degree, dependent on the individual’s ability to speak a language effectively. In the majority of cases, similar standardized tests are used as a screening mechanism with adults who are ESL learners. One such test, Speaking Proficient English Assessment Kit (SPEAK) has been used to place ESL learners in appropriate classes and support curriculum improvements. SPEAK, through research and examination of the test, does not realistically measure oral communication competency, leading to invalid results of language fluency and capability to use English in an occupational situation.\n\nThe European Union (EU) recognizes the importance of a multilingual and diverse work force; proficiency testing programs, such as the Common European Framework of Reference used in the United Kingdom, gauge potential employees not only on luency of a second language, but competency. Many potential employees may arrive for an interview and, although have scored high on English proficiency tests, are unable to communicate at a level that gains them a job in an English-speaking nation.\n\nApproximately 18% of the US population speak a language other than English, with 11% representing foreign-born individuals. Culture plays a role in how a person learns a language and communicates what they have learned and is substantially social in context. Moreover, lexical and grammatical pieces of language are strongly cultural, leading to a level of language complexity. \n\nThree paradigms can be considered when examining non-native speakers in a US culture: 1) communication apprehension, 2) self-perceived communication competency, and 3) social inclination to communicate. Insufficiencies in oral communication courses for English as a second language learners and appropriate curriculum contribute to the lack of oral communication competencies. These apprehensions contribute to the failure of some foreign students. In a qualitative study among Chinese graduate students, 94% of students reported their academic experience was negative and not enjoyable due to \"tremendous\" language barriers. Additionally, study abroad programs were thought to be a \"cure all\" for language and cultural barriers. However, students often arrive to their host countries linguistically underprepared.\n\nLanguage Power, further referred to as Language Power Theory (LPT) is the study of actual communication ability. Communication ability is the competence to speaking to be understood and listening to understand. LPT draws from and supports ideas from language knowledge, understanding there is a pragmatic and social structure that needs to be in place for successful language learning …since conversation is the most fundamental means of conducting human affairs.\n\nAcademic Knowledge is what students obtain in traditional language programs in traditional educational institutions. For largely historical, political and commercial reasons these traditional programs center on the course’s book. This can be considered book learning because the lack of available, cost-effective technology leaves no other option but to begin learning a language by reading it. \n\nConversely, Language Power traditionally develops with no book at all, nor any presumption of an ability to read. This is how we all learn our native language. Infants learn to speak their native language because they learn it ‘through their ears’ as a cognitive process, not through a book. To compare the efficacy of these two methods is revealing, in most cases, individuals come fully to master their native language resulting in high degrees of LP while only a fortunate small percentage of learners are able to obtain high levels of language power when learning a second language via traditional methods.\n\nLPT considers speaking to be understood, a simple transmit and receive process in which the speaker produces oral language that will be understood by a native speaker of that language. Research has shown that among Chinese students, even though the Chinese learners can construct grammatically correct English, it sounds awkward to a native ear. LPT advocates learning language to support the speaker’s ability to produce oral language to a certain level of \"native-ness\". Native-ness is the result of sufficient quality of pronunciation, fluency, rhythm and intonation. Research demonstrates that intonation of speech (i.e., pitch, speed, volume, etc.) is an important factor in learning conversational language. It is one of the primary measures of LP because it assesses the speaker’s ability to get his message across in a way that is completely understood by the native speaker. Key among these elements is a subset of fluency known as Rate of Speech (ROS) that is often measured in words per minute or more recently in phonemes per second. \n\nMeasuring one’s ability to speak and be understood has always been challenging since it is usually measured orally during a \"live interaction\" - a teacher works one on one with a student, perhaps asking questions and grading oral responses. Naturally, due to budget and time constraints, these types of measurements cannot be done nearly as often as desired. Furthermore, the subjective nature of these types of tests severely dilutes their validity and reliability. Yet, until recently, oral tests have been the only measure used to determine if what the student is saying will be understood by a native speaker of that language. In recent years, several countries have begun to employ computer-aided language learning (CALL) systems to assist their students in learning English. Research has shown in primary and secondary education, CALL programs are more engaging, assist students in cognitive abilities, and can be tailored to meet the needs of the learner.\n\nCALL has been employed to improve speech of ESL learners - however, there is a need to improve software to incorporate different levels of learning, specifically around oral communication. Recent tests of oral language systems show that they would be feasible to use in tangible applications. Furthermore, qualitative studies of computer-based programs proved to be a potent motivator in language learning; the outcome measures positively impacted by CALL were worker participation in union-based activities, such as negotiations, meetings, and a variety of services. \n\nLPT considers listening to understand the ability of a person to listen and understand a nonnative language at real world rates of speech with all the attributes of pronunciation, fluency rhythm and intonation. A review of data by Endress and Hauser (2010) demonstrates that adults listen and interpret language based on prosodic cues and these cues vary from language to language. The authors explain that listening to a native language has segmentations, similar to beads on a string, which differentiate words allowing the context to be fully understood. However, for non-native listeners, even if they have studied the particular second language, they have a difficult time segmenting words causing them to simply run together. For example, the authors explain stress (loudness, pitch, and duration) on certain syllables is different between English and French and although listeners can discern some prosodic cues of a foreign language, lack of language power hampers competent understanding. adult learners of a non-native language depend on lexical information that is already ingrained in their native language. Non-native speech may have different sets of language\nprocessing during parsing, which may impact comprehension. These differences can be highly situational, such as in academic listening.\n\nMeasurements of listening ability often require at least enough technology to broadcast recordings or require teachers to produce oral language. The biases of oral tests for listening and language comprehension is regrettably apparent when the tests involve a variable amount of teachers’ partisanship on what defines listening comprehension of a language.\n\nComputer Language systems have now come to the forefront and now have the ability to broadcast or playback audio for use in the assessment of listening skills. However, for this type of measurement to effectively measure LP as opposed to AK, the test items must be formed in a way that emulates real world listening. Specifically, the Rate of Speech (ROS) must be that of the real-world. Non-native speakers, when they attempt to use a second language conversationally in a real-time environment, must be able to process and interpret what they hear – at the rate at which the native speaker is speaking.\n"}

It is spoken by the Lezgins, who live in southern Dagestan, northern Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Germany and etc. Lezgian is a literary language and an official language of Dagestan. It is classified as \"vulnerable\" by UNESCO's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger. \n\nIn 2002, Lezgian was spoken by about 397,000 people in Russia, mainly Southern Dagestan, and in 1999 by 178,400 people in mainly the Qusar, Quba, Qabala, Oghuz, Ismailli and Khachmaz \"(Xaçmaz)\" provinces of northeastern Azerbaijan. Lezgian is also spoken in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Germany and Uzbekistan by immigrants from Azerbaijan and Dagestan.\n\nThere are also small populations in the Balikesir, Yalova, Izmir, Bursa regions in Turkey. The Lezgian people are concentrated mainly in Kirne (Ortaca) village of the Balikesir region.\n\nThe total number of speakers is about 800,000.\n\nThere are nine languages in the Lezgic language family, namely: Lezgian, Tabasaran, Rutul, Aghul, Tsakhur, Budukh, Kryts, Udi and Archi. These languages have the same names as their ethnic groups.\n\nSome of its dialects are considered very different from the standard form, including the Quba dialect spoken in Azerbaijan.\n\n\nThere are 54 consonants in Lezgian. Characters to the right are the letters of the Lezgian Cyrillic Alphabet. Note that aspiration is not normally indicated in the orthography, despite the fact that it is phonemic.\n\nLezgian has been written in several different alphabets over the course of its history. These alphabets have been based on three scripts: Arabic (before 1928), Latin (1928–38), and Cyrillic (1938–present).\n\nThe Lezgian Cyrillic alphabet is as follows:\n\nThe Latin alphabet was as follows:\nLezgian is unusual for a Northeast Caucasian language in not having noun classes (also called \"grammatical gender\"). Standard Lezgian grammar features 18 grammatical cases, produced by agglutinating suffixes, of which 12 are still used in spoken conversation.\n\nThe four grammatical cases are:\n\nThere are two types of declensions.\n\nThe numbers of Lezgian are:\n\nNouns following a number are always in the singular. Numbers precede the noun. \"Сад\" and \"кьвед\" lose their final \"-д\" before a noun.\n\nLezgian numerals work in a similar fashion to the French ones, and are based on the vigesimal system in which \"20\", not \"10\", is the base number. \"Twenty\" in Lezgian is \"къад\", and higher numbers are formed by adding the suffix -ни to the word (which becomes \"къанни\" - the same change occurs in пудкъад and кьудкъад) and putting the remaining number afterwards. This way 24 for instance is къанни кьуд (\"20 and 4\"), and 37 is къанни цӏерид (\"20 and 17\"). Numbers over 40 are formed similarly (яхцӏур becomes яхцӏурни). 60 and 80 are treated likewise. For numbers over 100 just put a number of hundreds, then (if need be) the word with a suffix, then the remaining number. 659 is thus ругуд вишни яхцӏурни цӏекӏуьд. The same procedure follows for 1000. 1989 is агьзурни кӏуьд вишни кьудкъанни кӏуьд in Lezgi.\n\n\n"}

When one of the instincts produces anxiety by exerting pressure on the ego either directly or by way of the superego, the ego may try to sidetrack the offending impulse by concentrating upon its opposite. For example, if feelings of hate towards another person make one anxious, the ego can facilitate the flow of love to conceal the hostility.\"\n\nWhere reaction-formation takes place, it is usually assumed that the original, rejected impulse does not vanish, but persists, unconscious, in its original infantile form. Thus, where love is experienced as a reaction formation against hate, we cannot say that love is substituted for hate, because the original aggressive feelings still exist underneath the affectionate exterior that merely \"masks\" the hate to hide it from awareness.\n\nIn a diagnostic setting, the existence of a reaction-formation rather than a 'simple' emotion would be suspected where \"exaggeration\", \"compulsiveness\" and \"inflexibility\" were observed. For example,\n\n\"[r]eactive love protests too much; it is overdone, extravagant, showy, and affected. It is counterfeit, and [...] is usually easily detected. Another feature of a reaction formation is its compulsiveness. A person who is defending himself against anxiety cannot deviate from expressing the opposite of what he really feels. His love, for instance, is not flexible. It cannot adapt itself to changing circumstances as genuine emotions do; rather it must be constantly on display as if any failure to exhibit it would cause the contrary feeling to come to the surface. Reaction formation is sometimes described as one of the most difficult defenses for lay people to understand; this testifies not merely to its effectiveness as a disguise, but also to its ubiquity and flexibility as a defense that can be utilized in many forms. For example, \"solicitude may be a reaction-formation against cruelty, cleanliness against coprophilia\", and it is not unknown for an analyst to explain a client's unconditional pacifism as a reaction formation against their sadism. In addition, \"[h]igh ideals of virtue and goodness may be reaction formations against primitive object cathexes rather than realistic values that are capable of being lived up to. Romantic notions of chastity and purity may mask crude sexual desires, altruism may hide selfishness, and piety may conceal sinfulness.\"\nEven more counter-intuitively, according to this model\n\"[a] phobia is an example of a reaction formation. The person wants what he fears. He is not afraid of the object; he is afraid of the wish for the object. The reactive fear prevents the dreaded wish from being fulfilled.\nThe concept of reaction formation has been used to explain responses to external threats as well as internal anxieties. In the phenomenon described as Stockholm Syndrome, a hostage or kidnap victim 'falls in love' with the feared and hated person who has complete power over them. Similarly paradoxical reports exist of powerless and vulnerable inmates of Nazi camps creating 'favourites' among the guards and even collecting objects discarded by them. The mechanism of reaction formation is often characteristic of obsessional neuroses. When this mechanism is overused, especially during the formation of the ego, it can become a permanent character trait. This is often seen in those with obsessional character and obsessive personality disorders. This does not imply that its periodic usage is always obsessional, but that it can lead to obsessional behavior.\n"}

Rim joists are not to be confused with end joists, which are the first and last joists at the ends of a row of joists that make up a floor or deck frame. \n\nA rim joist's relationship to the joists is similar to what the top or bottom wall plate is to the studs. It is also confusingly called a header (header also refers to other framing components) or rim board. Collectively, the end joists and rim joists are called band joists, especially in regard to deck construction. In dimensioned lumber construction, the rim joists are the same depth, thickness and material as the joists themselves; in engineered wood construction, the rim joists may be OSB, plywood or an engineered wood material varying in thickness from 1\" to as much as 1.75\", though they are usually LVL 1.125\" or LSL 1.25\" thick. In flooring construction, the rim joists sit on the sill plates; in deck construction, they are parallel to the support beams and sit on the beams or in some cases, cantilever away from the beams.\n\nA double thickness board in the position of a rim joist is called a \"flush beam\" and serves a dual purpose, providing primary support for the joist ends as well as capping the joists.\n"}

In Hindu philosophy, the word, \"Sākṣī\" or 'witness' refers to the 'Pure Awareness' that witnesses the world but does not get affected or involved. \"Sakshi\" is beyond time, space and the triad of experiencer, experiencing and experienced; \"sakshi\" witnesses all thoughts, words and deeds without interfering with them or being affected by them, other than \"sakshi\" there is nothing else in the entire universe.\n\nWith regard to the word, साक्षी (\"sākṣī\"), used in the following verse from Shvetashvatara Upanishad,\n\nPanini states that the same indicates a direct seer or eyewitness (Panini Sutras V.ii.91), Sakshi means Ishvara, the चेता (cetā), the sole Self-consciousness, who is the witness of all, who gives consciousness to every human being, thereby making each rational and discriminatory.\n\nVedanta speaks of mind (\"chitta\") or \"antahkarana\" ('internal instrument'), and matter as the subtle and gross forms of one and the same reality; being the subtle aspect of matter, mind is not a tangible reality. The field of mind (\"Chittakasha\") involves the duality of the seer and the seen, the observer (\"drg\") and the observed (\"drshya\"), which duality is overcome in the field of pure Consciousness. \"Drg-drshya-Viveka\" tells us:-\n\n\"Sakshi\", the Atman, the unchangeable eternal Reality, is the Pure Consciousness and knowledge, in which regard Sankara explains that knowledge does not destroy or create, it only illumines, that the senses (\"indriyas\") are not the mind, the mind uses them as an implement.\n\nThe Varaha Upanishad (IV) refers to the \"Bhumika\" ('stage of development of wisdom') which is of the form of \"pranava\" (\"Aum\" or \"Om\") as formed of or divided into – \"akāra\", \"ukāra\", \"makāra\" and \"ardhmātra\", which is on account of the difference of \"sthula\" ('gross'), \"sukshama\" ('subtle'), \"bija\" ('seed' or 'causal') and \"sakshi\" ('witness') whose \"avasthas\" ('states') are – 'waking', 'dreaming', 'dream-less sleep' and 'turiya'. \"Sakshi\" which is 'turiya' is the essence.\n\nThe faculty which perceives the individual personality is \"Sakshi\" or 'Witness' or the higher 'Ego'. Mind (\"manas\"), Ego (\"ahankara\") and \"Sakshi\", all perform different functions but that difference of functions does not mean difference in nature or essence. Indian Philosophy discovered the concept of \"Sakshi\", the ultimate Observer, or Witness behind the sense of individuality, or the ego; the \"Sakshi\" is the timeless Being which witnesses all this ceaseless flow and change in the world of thought and things.\n"}

The construction is generally used to indicate irony, sarcasm, derision, skepticism, or lack of interest with respect to comments about the discussed object:\nThe speaker is being skeptical. They do not think their kid is a baby or babyish.\nThe speaker is showing lack of interest. They do not care about the sale.\n\nThe original word can be a noun, but also an adjective:\nIn this case, it is being used to intensify the meaning of \"fancy\", implying that it's really fancy.\n\nIn general, the new combination is used as an interjection. In the case of adjectives, the reduplicated combination can belong to the same syntactical category as the original.\n\nBert Vaux and Andrew Nevins' online survey of shm-reduplication revealed further phonological details.\n\nThe construction originated in Yiddish and was subsequently transferred to English, especially urban northeastern American English, by Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrations from Central and Eastern Europe. It is now known and used by many non-Jewish English speakers, particularly American English. \nThe construction was also adopted in Modern Hebrew usage as a prefix resulting in a derogatory echoic expressive. For example, March 29, 1955 David Ben-Gurion dismissed a United Nations resolution as \"Um-Shmum\", (U.M. being its Hebrew acronym, pronounced \"oom-schmoom\").\n\nZuckerman wrote: \"When an Israeli speaker would like to express his impatience with or disdain for philosophy, s/he can say \"filosófya-shmilosófya\"\". In German Yiddish the same construction is possible, too, for example: \"Visum-Schmisum\" (i.e.: visa permits that have been somehow obtained, possibly below the level of legality).\nZuckermann (2009) mentions in this context the Turkic initial m-segment conveying a sense of \"and so on\" as in the Turkish sentence \"dergi mergi okumuyor\", literally \"magazine 'shmagazine' read:NEGATIVE:PRESENT:3rd person singular\", i.e. \"(He) doesn’t read magazines, journals or anything like that\".\n\nA similar phenomenon is present in most of the languages of the Balkan sprachbund, especially in colloquial Bulgarian where not only \"sh(m)-\" and \"m-\", but also other consonants and consonant clusters are used in this way, and its usage has its particularities that differ from what the English 'shm' indicates.\n\nShm-reduplication has been advanced as an example of a natural-language phenomenon that cannot be captured by a context-free grammar. The essential argument was that the reduplication can be repeated indefinitely, producing a sequence of phrases of geometrically increasing length, which cannot occur in a context-free language.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "763275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=763275", "title": "Tiberian Hebrew", "text": "Tiberian Hebrew\n\nTiberian Hebrew is the canonical pronunciation of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh committed to writing by Masoretic scholars living in the Jewish community of Tiberias in ancient Judea . They wrote in the form of Tiberian vocalization, which employed diacritics added to the Hebrew letters: vowel signs and consonant diacritics (nequdot) and the so-called accents (two related systems of cantillation signs or te'amim). These together with the marginal notes masora magna and masora parva make up the Tiberian apparatus.\n\nThough the written vowels and accents came into use only c. 750 CE, the oral tradition they reflect is many centuries older, with ancient roots. Although not in common use today, the Tiberian pronunciation of Hebrew is considered by textual scholars to be the most accurate reproduction of the original Semitic consonantal and vowel sounds of ancient Hebrew.\n\nToday's Hebrew grammar books do not teach the Tiberian Hebrew that was described by the early grammarians. The prevailing view is that of David Qimchi's system of dividing the graphic signs into \"short\" and \"long\" vowels. The values assigned to the Tiberian vowel signs reveals a Sephardi tradition of pronunciation (the dual quality of qames () as , ; the pronunciation of simple \"sheva\" () as ).\n\nThe phonology of Tiberian Hebrew can be gleaned from the collation of various sources:\nIn the last two, it is evident that the chain of transmission is breaking down or that their interpretations are influenced by local tradition.\n\nTiberian Hebrew has 29 consonantal phonemes, represented by 22 letters. The sin dot distinguishes between the two values of , with a dot on the left () being pronounced the same as the letter Samekh. The letters (begadkefat) had two values each: plosive and fricative.\n\nThe following are the most salient characteristics of the Tiberian Hebrew consonantal pronunciation:\n\n\n\n\nThe vowel qualities have phonemic status: (Lev. 5:19) and 'guilty', 'when' and 'mother'. has phonemic value in final stressed position , but in other positions, it may reflect loss of the opposition : . By the Tiberian period, all short vowels in stressed syllables had lengthened, making vowel length allophonic. Vowels in open or stressed syllables had allophonic length (such as in , which was previously short).\n\nThe Tiberian tradition possesses three reduced (ultrashort, \"hatuf\") vowels of which has questionable phonemicity. , under a non-guttural letter, was pronounced as an ultrashort copy of the following vowel before a guttural ( ) and as preceding , ( ). However, it was always pronounced as under gutturals: .\n\nTiberian Hebrew has phonemic stress ( 'they built' vs. 'in us'). Stress is most commonly ultimate, less commonly penultimate and rarely antipenultimate stress: 'into the tent'.\n\nAs described above, vowel length was dependent on syllable structure. Open syllables must take long or ultrashort vowels; stressed closed syllables take long vowels; unstressed closed syllables take short vowels. Traditional Hebrew philology considers ultrashort vowels not to be syllable nuclei.\n\nThe simple \"sheva\" sign changes its pronunciation depending on its position in the word (mobile/vocal or quiescent/zero), as well as due to its proximity to certain consonants.\n\nIn the examples given below, it has been preferred to show one found precisely in the Bible which represents each phenomenon in a graphic manner (i.e. a chateph vowel), although these rules still apply when there is only simple \"sheva\" (depending on the manuscript or edition used).\n\nWhen the simple \"sheva\" appears in any of the following positions, it is regarded as mobile (na):\n\n\nThe gutturals (), and yodh (), affect the pronunciation of the \"sheva\" preceding them. The allophones of the phoneme follow these two rules:\n\n\nIt must be said that, even though there are no special signs apart to denote the full range of furtive vowels, these remaining four () are represented by simple \"sheva\" (chateph chireq () in the Aleppo Codex is a scribal oddity, and certainly not regular in Hebrew manuscripts with Tiberian vocalization).\n\nAll other cases should be treated as zero vowel (quiescent, nah), including the double final \"sheva\" (double initial \"sheva\" does not exist in this Hebrew dialect), and the \"sheva\" in the words and , read by the Tiberian Masoretes as and respectively. This last case has similarities with phenomena occurring in the Samaritan pronunciation and the Phoenician language.\n\nDepending on the school of pronunciation (and relying on musical grounds, perhaps), the metheg sign served to change some closed syllables into open ones, and therefore, changing the vowel from short to long, and the quiescent \"sheva\", into a mobile one.\n\nThat is referenced specifically by medieval grammarians:\nThe names of the vowel diacritics are iconic and show some variation:\n"}

At sixteen, he started visiting the literary cafés, where he met an international company, so diverse that they spoke Latin to be understood by all. The eldest of the group was an Irishman, named James Joyce (1882–1941).\n\nIn 1906, with his parents, Llona moved to the US and lived in Chicago. He remained in touch with Europe and through André Gide he had two of his short stories published in the \"Nouvelle revue française\" (1911 and 1913). Llona came back to Paris in 1913 but when the war broke out he returned to the US and lived in New York City, where he made the acquaintance of several novelists of the new generation. He decided that he would make them known in France.\n\nReturning to France and having gained the confidence of Parisian publishers (Payot, Stock, Plon, Fayard, Albin Michel, La Renaissance du Livre, Gallimard), he was going to translate some forty books into French, between 1920 and 1939, amongst them Scott Fitzgerald (The Great Gatsby), Ambrose Bierce, Ezra Pound, Theodore Dreiser (An American Tragedy), Sherwood Anderson, Ernest Hemingway, Edna Ferber, Willa Cather and also several works by the Argentinian- English writer William Henry Hudson (1841–1922). With the help of a native Russian he was also able to translate several Russian works, from Alexis Tolstoï, Nikolai Gogol and Elie Ilf.\n\nLlona also wrote in magazines, especially about James Joyce and Samuel Beckett. He also wrote two novels in French, one about the Ku Klux Klan, one about prohibition in the States. He also co-authored a biography of Peter the Great, with the Russian émigré Dimitri Novik.\n\nA few pages of Llona's Memoirs have been published, in which he speaks about his friendship with French writers, such as Pierre Benoit, Marcel Proust, Francis Carco, Henri Poulaille, Jean Galtier-Boissière, Jules Supervielle, Paul Morand, Pierre Mac Orlan, Jacques de Lacretelle, Julien Green and Roger Martin du Gard. He remained also a friend of the major NRF figures, like André Gide, Jean Schlumberger, Valéry Larbaud, André Ruyters and Jacques Rivière. Llona also had great friendship with the Belgian poet and designer Jean de Bosschère (1878–1953), who made a lithographed portrait of him. He also wrote an essay on the French writer Louis Thomas and befriended him and his opera singing wife Raymonde Delaunois.\n\nLlona remained also in contact with American writers of the 'Lost Generation', amongst them Hemingway, Ezra Pound, Nathalie Clifford Barney, Paul Bowles, Thornton Wilder and Scott Fitzgerald. He met them in the apartments of Gertrude Stein (1874–1946) and Peggy Guggenheim (1898–1979) or at the English library of Sylvia Beach (1887–1962), the first publisher in 1922 of James Joyce's \"Ulysses\".\n\nIn 1929 Shakespeare and Company, the library of Sylvia Beach, published a book with twelve articles, brought together by Eugene Jolas (1894–1952), the editor of transition, defending 'Work in progress', the book by Joyce that would be published only ten years later under the title 'Finnegans wake'. In this book titled Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress, Llona was one of the twelve authors and wrote under a very much 'Joycian' title: ‘I Dont Know What to Call It but Its Mighty Unlike Prose’ .\n\nIn 1939 With the war approaching, Llona, remarried, left France and established himself in Lima. In 1946 he returned to the US and became a translator for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Soil may be regarded as waterlogged when it is nearly saturated with water much of the time such that its air phase is restricted and anaerobic conditions prevail. In extreme cases of prolonged waterlogging, anaerobiosis occurs, the roots of mesophytes suffer, and the subsurface reducing atmosphere leads to such processes as denitrification, methanogenesis, and the reduction of iron and manganese oxides.\n\nIn agriculture, various crops need air (specifically, oxygen) to a greater or lesser depth in the soil. Waterlogging of the soil stops air getting in. How near the water table must be to the surface for the ground to be classed as waterlogged, varies with the purpose in view. A crop's demand for freedom from waterlogging may vary between seasons of the year, as with the growing of rice (\"Oryza sativa\").\n\nIn irrigated agricultural land, waterlogging is often accompanied by soil salinity as waterlogged soils prevent leaching of the salts imported by the irrigation water.\n\nFrom a gardening point of view, waterlogging is the process whereby the soil blocks off all water and is so hard it stops air getting in and it stops oxygen from getting in.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2259738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2259738", "title": "Xenocentrism", "text": "Xenocentrism\n\nXenocentrism is the preference for the products, styles, or ideas of someone else's culture rather than of one's own. One example is the romanticization of the noble savage in the 18th-century primitivism movement in European art, philosophy and ethnography. Xenocentrism is countered by ethnocentrism, the perceived superiority of one's own society to others. Both xenocentrism and ethnocentrism are a subjective take on cultural relativism.\n\nXenocentrism was coined by American sociologists Donald P. Kent and Robert G. Burnight in the 1952 paper \"Group Centrism in Complex Societies\" published in the \"American Journal of Sociology\". Kent and Burnight state that feelings of xenocentrism are caused by three possible factors; individuals who have familial ties to a foreign country, specifically 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants, those who oppose the political choices of their native country, an example of this being the Communist Party USA which idealized the Soviet Union and its anti-capitalist government, and individuals who are exposed to other cultures and grow disenchanted with and rebel against their own society. The term remained obscure but considered useful and occasionally used by other sociologists. The University of Florida treats it as a key term of Sociology.\n\nThe term is opposed to ethnocentrism, as coined by 19th-century American sociologist William Graham Sumner, which describes the natural tendencies of an individual to place disproportionate worth upon the values and beliefs of one's own culture relative to others.\n\nRene Dentiste Mueller and Amanda Broderick were the first to apply the consumer xenocentrism (CX) concept to describe the preference some consumers have for foreign goods even when domestic goods are qualitatively and/or functionally similar or better. Although the CX phenomenon is global, the researchers cite a significant number of studies that suggests there are proportionally more consumer xenocentrics in former colonies where the locals have been conditioned to perceive ‘foreign’ as better. A consequence of consumer xenocentrism is its negative effect on local industry and on the decline in living standards as poor consumers buy the (often) more expensive foreign products. Consumer xenocentrism, especially among the local elites, reduces confidence and pride in local manufacturing which can lead to the loss of local industries, a decline in purchase choices, especially among traditional products or even a dependency on foreign ones. Mueller, Wang, Liu and Cui, applied the concept to China and showed consumer xenocentrism is not a new phenomenon. The researchers were also able to show that when consumer xenocentrism grew too much, a ‘protection of the herd’ mentality caused the pendulum to swing back towards consumer ethnocentrism (nationalism).\n\nIn his doctoral dissertation, Steven James Lawrence suggests xenocentrism may be an influential in making consumers buying decisions as they might have \"favorable orientations to products from outside their membership group.\n\nPuja Mondal cited some examples from India:\nGrace Susetyo suggests \"the idea that foreign cultures and their elements are superior to the local\" causes a crisis of cultural identity among Western-educated Indonesians and is a problem that needs to be eradicated.\n\nGeorge Balabanis and Adamantios Diamantopoulos further defined consumer xenocentrism to be a multi-dimensional construct by which to explain consumer affinities for foreign products. They define consumer xenocentrism to be rooted in two concepts, perceived inferiority of domestic goods and aggrandized perception of foreign products.\n\nThe Academy of International Business is studying \"out of group favoritism and in-group derogation\" as a consumer effect in the Chinese consumer market.\n\nLawrence uses the definition of xenocentrism, conceived by Kent and Burnight, to describe propose a potential scale, CXENO, to predict how xenocentric views of non-domestic goods affects consumer behavior. The most recently proposed scale to quantity xenocentric consumer tendencies, XSCALE, includes both instances of social and consumer xenocentrism.\n\nEconomists have begun to include consumer xenocentrism, along with other consumer centrisms such as consumer ethnocentrism and consumer cosmopolitanism, in their analysis of consumer behavior. Most recent research has looked at how these three centrisms impact one another.\n\n"}
