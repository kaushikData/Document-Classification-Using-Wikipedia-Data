{"id": "5376779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5376779", "title": "Active shooter", "text": "Active shooter\n\nActive shooter or active killer names the perpetrator of a type of mass murder marked by rapidity, scale, randomness, and often suicide. The United States Department of Homeland Security defines an \"active shooter\" as \"an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use firearms and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims.\"\n\nMost incidents occur at locations in which the killers find little impediment in pressing their attack. Locations are generally described as \"soft targets\", that is, they carry limited security measures to protect members of the public. In most instances, shooters commit suicide, are shot by police, or surrender when confrontation with responding law enforcement becomes unavoidable, and active shooter events are often over in 10 to 15 minutes. According to New York City Police Department (NYPD) statistics, 46percent of active shooter incidents are ended by the application of force by police or security, 40percent end in the shooter's suicide, 14percent of the time the shooter surrenders and, in less than 1percent of cases, the violence ends with the attacker fleeing.\n\nIn police training manuals, the police response to an active shooter scenario is different from hostage rescue and barricaded suspect situations. Police officers responding to an armed barricaded suspect often deploy with the intention of containing the suspect within a perimeter, gaining information about the situation, attempting negotiation with the suspect, and waiting for specialist teams like SWAT.\n\nIf police officers believe that a gunman intends to kill as many people as possible before committing suicide, they may use a tactic like Immediate Action Rapid Deployment.\n\nThe terminology \"active shooter\" is critiqued by some academics. There have been several mass stabbings that have high casualty counts, for instance in Belgium (Dendermonde nursery attack), Canada (2014 Calgary stabbing), China (2008 Beijing Drum Tower stabbings), Japan (Osaka School Massacre and Sagamihara stabbings), and Pennsylvania (Franklin Regional High School stabbing). Ron Borsch recommends the phrase \"rapid mass murder\". Due to a worldwide increase in firearm and non-firearm based Mass Casualty Attacks (including attacks with vehicles, explosives, incendiary devices, stabbings, slashing, acid attacks), Dr. Tau Braun and the Violence Prevention Agency (VPA) has encouraged the use of the more accurate descriptor Mass Casualty Attacker (MCA).\n\nActive shooters do not negotiate, killing as many people as possible, often to gain notoriety. Active shooters generally do not lie in wait to battle responding law enforcement officers. Few law enforcement officers have been injured responding to active shooter incidents; fewer still have been killed. As noted, more often than not, when the prospect of confrontation with responding law enforcement becomes unavoidable, the active shooter commits suicide. And when civilians—even unarmed civilians—resist, the active shooter crumbles.\n\nBorsch's statistical analysis recommends a tactic: aggressive action. For law enforcement, the tactical imperative is to respond and engage the killer without delaythe affected orthodoxy of cumbersome team formations fails to answer the rapid temporal dynamics of active shooter events and fails to grasp the nature of the threat involved. For civilians, when necessity or obligation calls, the tactical mandate is to attack the attacker—a strategy that has proved successful across a range of incidents from Norina Bentzel (William Michael Stankewicz) in Pennsylvania and Bill Badger in Arizona (2011 Tucson shooting) to David Benke in Colorado.\n\nThe active shooter incidents do not always meet the classification of a mass murder. Mass murders result when three or more individuals are killed. The definition of an active shooter does not require that victims are killed, only that they are injured or wounded by the act. Not all mass murderers are active shooters. Noting the similarities and differences among several types of mass murder will help to isolate and define what is meant by the term \"active shooter\".\n\nMass murderers defy traditional criminal categorization. The goal of the mass murderer is neither to defend nor appropriate turf or territory, neither to initiate himself into nor elevate his status within a criminal organization. The mass murderer does not kill for drugs or money. The serial killer is one kind of mass murderer. He claims many lives in multiple events across time. The events are discontinuous, punctuated by \"a cooling-off period\". By contrast, the active shooter claims many lives in a single event along a compressed frame of time. In practice, this appears to carry a corollary: broadly, the serial killer seeks anonymity; the active shooter, notoriety. Repetition through multiple events across time answers the pathology of the serial killer. Savage as they are, his acts are not designed to excite publicity. The serial killer will conceal a corpse or bury evidence. He wants to kill again. By contrast, the active shooter seeks infamy through slaughter. He means to fuse his name forever to a place, a date, an event. Thus, his acts are designed to maximize publicity. Accordingly, he (generally) plans no escape.\n\nThe serial killer murders at close quarters, delighting in experiencing the horror of his victims as he shares their space. In his distorted estimation, his victims \"mean\" something to him, and he may secure keepsakes from victims to memorialize the \"relationship\". The active shooter also murders at close quarters. He delights in experiencing the horror of his victims as he shares their space. Crucially, however, while the victims of the serial killer \"mean\" something to him, to the active shooter they mean nothing. The active shooter moves rapidly from one victim to the next.\n\nModell speculates that the contrast is rooted in the peculiar form of abuse each suffers. The serial killer is a victim of physical/sexual/emotional abuse. Such abuse is administered at length, over time, by those who, by relation or connection, should care for the abused. The serial killer, after a manner, models this behavior. The active shooter is a victim of bullying. Though bullying may persist over time, it is delivered in discrete, relatively short-lived acts, often by multiple actors with no special relation or connection to the abused. The active shooter, after a manner, models this behavior.\n\nA portrait of the active shooter may be sharpened by contrasting him with another type of mass murderer, the ideological killer. The Oklahoma City bombing exemplifies the type: in 1995, a man with ties to a disorganized militia movement detonated a truck bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in downtown Oklahoma City, and the resulting blast ended 168lives while wounding680.\n\nThe ideological killer is driven by adherence to ethico-political or religious orthodoxy. His actions are an expression of that orthodoxy. By contrast, while the active shooter may conceive of himself as \"making a statement\" of sorts, his motives appear more personal and desultory.\n\nLike the active shooter, the ideological killer plans multiple murders within the confines of a single event. But the active shooter seeks to experience the horror of his victims at close quarters. The ideological killer does not. He kills at a distance. He plants explosive devices or takes up position as a sniper. Killing at a distance suits his primary motive—the expression of adherence to an abstract orthodoxy. For the ideological killer, victims are of incidental significance. He need not \"know\" them, as the serial killer must, nor experience their horror, as the active shooter must. For the ideological killer, abstraction is reality, the individual but a construct in an interminable struggle of dogmas.\n\nSince he is motivated by adherence to orthodoxy, the ideological killer typically seeks notoriety for his cause through carnage. While the active shooter too seeks notoriety, and while he too maps a careful plan of the event, there is a crucial difference in the pursuit. The ideological killer generally means to elude capture, to live beyond the event (as does the serial killer). The active shooter merges his identity with the event and sees nothing beyond.\n\nIntegrating the elements elicited by comparison and contrast, the \"active shooter (killer)\" may be defined as a mass murderer who kills (or attempts to kill) at close-quarters, in multiples, at random in a single, planned event.\n\nAccounts of why active shooters do what they do vary. Some contend that the motive, at least proximately, is vengeance. Others argue that bullying breeds the problem, and sometimes the active shooter is a victim of bullying, directly or derivatively. Still others such as Grossman and DeGaetano argue that the pervasiveness of violent imagery girding modern culture hosts the phenomenon.\n\nSome argue that a particular interpretation of the world, a conscious or subconscious ontology, accounts for the phenomenon. They argue that the active shooter lives in a world of victims and victimizers, that all are one or the other. The ontology accommodates no nuance, no room between the categories for benevolence, friendship, decency, nor indeed, for a mixture of good and bad. His interpretation of the world may grow out of or be fed by bullying or violent imagery (hence the common obsession with violent movies, books or video games), but it is the absolutist interpretation of his world that drives him both to kill and to die.\n\nIn \"The Psychology of the Active Killer\", Daniel Modell writes that \"The world conceived by the active killer is a dark dialectic of victim and victimizer. His impoverished ontology brooks no nuance, admits no resolution. The two categories, isolated and absolute, exhaust and explain his world. And the peculiar logic driving the dialectic yields a fatal inference: in a world of victims and victimizers, success means victimization.\"\n\nMany government installations, businesses, campuses have camera and sensor based security systems, some analog and, more recently, digital. Some also include formal Command Centers or at least are monitored by personnel in any organization. These provide very good forensic support in documenting an active shooter. However they offer only mixed results in the timely interdiction of an active shooter.\n\n\n"}

His parents could not afford to send him to school, so he worked on the family farm until he was 17 years old and could support his own education. He studied medicine at Williams College, then studied theology at Andover Seminary. After graduating from Andover, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. Soon, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent him to establish missions for the Choctaw tribe in Mississippi, where he met and married Harriet Bunce. \n\nIn 1831, all mission activity ceased while the Choctaws fulfilled an agreement with the United States government to sell their Mississippi homeland and relocate to Indian Territory (the present state of Oklahoma). Late in 1832, the Wrights decided to locate a new mission near present-day Eagletown, Oklahoma. From then until 1846, they built and operated a church and a school to minister to Choctaws living in the surrounding area. Wright named the mission Wheelock, in honor of Eleazar Wheelock, a friend and first president of Dartmouth College.\n\nTrained in medicine, Alfred Wright often needed to tend Choctaw patients who lived some distance from the mission. Harriet took on both teaching and administrative duties for the school, with only one other teacher to assist her. When Alfred was at the mission, he was often busy either preparing sermons or translating religious texts from English to the Choctaw language. Moreover, his physical health was compromised by illnesses through much of his life. Attacks of illness increased in frequency and intensity as he grew older, but he maintained a hectic pace as much as possible. He died on March 31, 1853, and was buried near the mission. Harriet tried to keep the mission going throughout the next year, but soon found her own health was failing. She returned to the East to live with members of her own family, and died in Florida in 1863.\n\nAlfred Wright was born in Columbia, Connecticut on March 1, 1788. His parents were Jeriah (1788-1828) and Temperance (d. 1832) Wright, who were both professors of religion. The family owned a small farm and had eleven children, so could not afford to send Alfred to school. Instead he worked on the family farm until the age of seventeen. By then, he decided to earn his own education. His parents consented to his enrolling in Bacon Academy in Colchester, Massachusetts. Despite his frail health, he was also able to obtain a job teaching school part-time. He enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1810. Although he initially intended to study medicine and become a doctor, before he finished at Williams, he felt the call to study theology. After graduating from Williams College in September, 1812, he was employed as a preceptor of an academy at Hadley, Massachusetts until November, 1813, when he enrolled at Andover Seminary.\n\nAlfred was ordained as a Presbyterian minister at Charleston, South Carolina on December 17, 1819.\n\nSoon after his ordination, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions assigned him to establish a Presbyterian mission with the Choctaws in Goshen, Mississippi where he remained until 1823, when he was sent to the Mayhew Mission. While at Mayhew, Alfred met Harriet Bunce (1779-1863). They married in 1825.\n\nIn 1826, Alfred's sister and two of his brothers died of typhus. Their father contracted the same disease, but his case was not fatal. \n\nAll mission operations ceased in 1831, as the inhabitants of the Choctaw Nation were required to move to their newly designated land in Indian Territory (present-day Southeastern Oklahoma). Alfred and Harriet, along with another missionary, Rev. Loring S. Williams, joined a group of Choctaws led by Thomas LeFlore to make the trip. The party did not reach Indian Territory until September 14, 1832, where they stopped overnight at the Bethabara Mission, near the community of Eagle (now known as Eagletown, Oklahoma, in present-day McCurtain County, Oklahoma. Alfred had taken ill again, and could not continue to travel the next day. Deciding to remain at Bethabara Mission, he told Harriet to go ahead with the rest of the party, and he would catch up with them later. The McCurtain party moved out as planned along the Military Trace toward Fort Towson. After the group crossed what is now called the Little River (known to the Choctaws as \"Boklusa\" or \"Black River\"), they found a piece of land about a mile beyond the river and above the flood level, which also had a spring flowing generously with cold water. Harriet decided to camp there with Anna and other travelers who wished to stay with her. The others helped Harriet build a cabin. This would become the site for the Wright's mission.\n\nAlfred recovered slowly, and finally caught up with Harriet and her companions in late November, 1832. He conducted his first service at the new site on December 9, 1832. Since there was no church building yet, the service was held outdoors under a large oak tree. The congregation sat on logs that had been arranged in rows, and Rev. Wright used an empty 100 gallon barrel, turned upside down, as his pulpit. Concurrently, the Wright party decided to build a small log church and a larger log house for the family. Harriet insisted that a large room be attached to the house to serve as a day school. Rev. Wright decided to name the new mission church and school Wheelock, in honor of Eleazar Wheelock, who was not only a friend of Alfred, but, years later, also the first president of Dartmouth College.\n\nThe day school operated until 1839. By then, Harriet realized that this mode was failing to enough Choctaw children who needed and wanted to pursue an education. She persuaded Alfred that Wheelock should become a boarding school because many of the potential students lived at such a distance that it was impractical to attend daily classes on foot. In bad weather, travel became nearly impossible, even on horseback. A log dormitory building was erected in 1839, then expanded over the next three years. A separate classroom building was also built. Instead of paying tuition, the children performed many of the chores need to operate the school: cooking, cleaning, providing firewood, etc. Class time was devoted to learning English, arithmetic, reading, writing and studying the Bible. In 1842, the Choctaw Nation adopted Wheelock into its school system, designating it as Wheelock Seminary, a school exclusively devoted to teaching Choctaw girls.\n\nRev. Wright began building a new Wheelock Rock Church in 1845. Stones were dragged by from the banks of Little River by teams of oxen. These were used to make the church walls thick. The floor and belfry were made from cypress wood and the roof was covered with sun-cured oak shakes. Wright carved a slogan, \"Jehovah Jireh\" (meaning \"the Lord will provide\") into the gable of the church. Rev. Wright delivered the first sermon in the new church during the late spring or early summer of 1846.\n\nRev. Alfred Wright's attacks of illness increased in frequency and intensity as he grew older, yet he persisted in maintaining a hectic pace. He died on March 31, 1853, and was buried very near Wheelock church. Harriet tried to keep on with the school during 1854, but found her own health failing rapidly by the end of the school year. She went back east to live the rest with members of her own family, and died on October 3, 1863 in Madison, Florida.\n"}

{"id": "44065971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44065971", "title": "Blockchain", "text": "Blockchain\n\nA blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called \"blocks\", which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash).\n\nBy design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.\n\nBlockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications, and blockchains which are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is considered a type of payment rail. Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Sources such as the \"Computerworld\" called the marketing of such blockchains without a proper security model \"snake oil\".\n\nThe first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.\n\nThe first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party. The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.\n\nIn August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes). In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.\n\nThe words \"block\" and \"chain\" were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, \"blockchain,\" by 2016. The term \"blockchain 2.0\" refers to new applications of the distributed blockchain database, first emerging in 2014. \"The Economist\" described one implementation of this second-generation programmable blockchain as coming with \"a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level.\"\n\n, blockchain 2.0 implementations continue to require an off-chain oracle to access any \"external data or events based on time or market conditions [that need] to interact with the blockchain.\"\n\nIBM opened a blockchain innovation research center in Singapore in July 2016. A working group for the World Economic Forum met in November 2016 to discuss the development of governance models related to blockchain.\n\nAccording to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters phase. Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n\nIn May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term ‘planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain’.\n\nIn November 2018, Conservative MEP Emma McClarkin’s plan to utilise blockchain technology to boost trade was backed by the European Parliament’s Trade Committee. \n\nA blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively. A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests. Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A blockchain has been described as a \"value-exchange protocol\". This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems. A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.\n\nBlocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree. Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain. This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.\n\nSometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher value can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks. Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low. For example, in a blockchain using the proof-of-work system, the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is always considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.\n\nThe \"block time\" is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is 10 minutes.\n\nBy storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally. The decentralized blockchain may use ad-hoc message passing and distributed networking.\n\nPeer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of failure. Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography. A \"public key\" (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A \"private key\" is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.\n\nEvery node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive database replication and computational trust. No centralized \"official\" copy exists and no user is \"trusted\" more than any other. Transactions are broadcast to the network using software. Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis. Mining nodes validate transactions, add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes. Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes. Alternative consensus methods include proof-of-stake. Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.\n\nOpen blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain. Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term \"blockchain\" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases. Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain. Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision. Nikolai Hampton of \"Computerworld\" said that \"many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases,\" and \"without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion.\"\n\nThe great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed. This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper \"Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail\".\n\nFinancial companies have not prioritised decentralized blockchains.\nIn 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China. Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. , bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.\n\nPermissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network. In contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner. They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they benefit from the network effect. Permissioned blockchains can also go by the name of 'consortium' or 'hybrid' blockchains.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" noted in both 2016 and 2017 that many corporations are using blockchain networks \"with private blockchains, independent of the public system.\"\n\nNikolai Hampton pointed out in \"Computerworld\" that \"There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished.\" This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others, and \"the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power—it's time consuming and expensive.\" He also said, \"Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases.\"\n\nBlockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies, most notably bitcoin. There are a few operational products maturing from proof of concept by late 2016.\n\n, some observers remain skeptical. Steve Wilson, of Constellation Research, believes the technology has been hyped with unrealistic claims. To mitigate risk, businesses are reluctant to place blockchain at the core of the business structure.\n\nMost cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the bitcoin network and Ethereum network are blockchain-based. On May 8, 2018 Facebook confirmed that it is opening a new blockchain group which will be headed by David Marcus who previously was in charge of Messenger. According to The Verge Facebook is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency for facilitating payments on the platform.\n\nBlockchain-based smart contracts are proposed contracts that could be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction. One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. An IMF staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general. But \"no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged.\" Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear.\n\nMajor portions of the financial industry are implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking, and according to a September 2016 IBM study, this is occurring faster than expected.\n\nBanks are interested in this technology because it has potential to speed up back office settlement systems.\n\nBanks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nBerenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an \"overhyped technology\" that has had a large number of \"proofs of concept\", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.\n\nSome video games are based on blockchain technology. The first such game, \"Huntercoin\", was released in February, 2014. Another blockchain game is \"CryptoKitties\", launched in November 2017. The game made headlines in December 2017 when a cryptokitty character - an-in game virtual pet - was sold for US$100,000. \"CryptoKitties\" illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network with about 30% of all Ethereum transactions being for the game.\n\nCryptokitties also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets (digital assets).\n\nWithin the video game industry, while blockchain use is seen as part of a marketplace mechanism, such as with Robot Cache, blockchain is also postulated as a way to share video game assets between various games. The Blockchain Game Alliance was formed in September 2018 to explore alternative uses of blockchains in video gaming with support of Ubisoft and Fig, among others.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users or musicians. In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution. Imogen Heap's Mycelia service has also been proposed as blockchain-based alternative \"that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians.\" Everledger is one of the inaugural clients of IBM's blockchain-based tracking service.\n\nNew distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain. The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers. Online voting is another application of the blockchain.\n\nOther designs include:\n\nIn September 2018, IBM and a start-up Hu-manity.co launched a blockchain-based app that let patients sell anonymized data to pharmaceutical companies.\n\nCurrently, there are three types of blockchain networks - public blockchains, private blockchains and consortium blockchains.\n\nA public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol). Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.\n\nSome of the largest, most known public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nA private blockchain is permissioned. One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted.\n\nThis type of blockchains can be considered a middle-ground for companies that are interested in the blockchain technology in general but are not comfortable with a level of control offered by public networks. Typically, they seek to incorporate blockchain into their accounting and record-keeping procedures without sacrificing autonomy and running the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.\n\nA consortium blockchain is often said to be semi-decentralized. It, too, is permissioned but instead of a single organization controlling it, a number of companies might each operate a node on such a network. The administrators of a consortium chain restrict users' reading rights as they see fit and only allow a limited set of trusted nodes to execute a consensus protocol.\n\nIn October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements has criticized the public proof-of-work blockchains for high energy consumption.\n\nNicholas Weaver, of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley examines blockchain's online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains, and in both cases finds it grossly inadequate.\n\nIn September 2015, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research, \"Ledger\", was announced. The inaugural issue was published in December 2016. The journal covers aspects of mathematics, computer science, engineering, law, economics and philosophy that relate to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nThe journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which will then be timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28842551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28842551", "title": "Catalan verbs", "text": "Catalan verbs\n\nThis article discusses the conjugation of verbs in a number of varieties of Catalan, including Old Catalan. Each verbal form is accompanied by its phonetic transcription. Widely used dialectal forms are included, even if they are not considered standard in either of the written norms: those of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (based on central Catalan) and the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (based on common Valencian). Other dialectal forms exist, including those characteristic of minor dialects such as Ribagorçan and Algherese and transitional forms of major dialects (such as those spoken in the lower Ebro basin area around Tortosa and in the Empordà).\n\nThe Catalan verb system has grammatical categories similar to those of neighbouring Romance languages such as Spanish, Occitan, French, and Italian. The formal similarities with Occitan are most noticeable. There is a visible divergence between Catalan and Occitan in Catalan second-person plural endings: \"-au, -eu, -iu\", instead of the Occitan \"-atz, -etz, -itz\".\n\nOne feature of Catalan is the periphrastic preterite tense for referring to the remote past, which is constructed with characteristic present-tense forms of the verb \"anar\" (to go) and the infinitive of a verb (\"vaig parlar, vas/vares parlar, va parlar, vam/vàrem parlar, vau/vàreu parlar, van/varen parlar\"). This tense, rare in Romance languages and shared only with some Gascon and Aragonese (Benasque, Gistaín) dialects, seems to have existed in Catalan since at least the 13th century.\n\nThe simple preterite indicative, descending from the Latin perfect indicative, is primarily used in contemporary written Catalan. Although it has been largely replaced by the periphrastic preterite in the spoken language, the simple preterite indicative is still used in dialects such as central Valencian and the Catalan spoken on Ibiza.\n\nAnother difference between contemporary and Old Catalan is the shift in simple preterite indicative endings from an etymological to an analogous pattern in third-person plural: from the Old Catalan -\"é\", -\"ast\", -\"à\", -\"am\", -\"às\", and -\"aren\" to the contemporary -\"í\", -\"ares\", -\"à\", -\"àrem\", -\"àreu\", and -\"aren\". This change occurred between the 13th and 15th centuries.\n\nThe table below summarises the inflected forms.\nFinite Catalan verbs have an imperfective or perfective aspect.\n\nRegular Catalan verbs have the following imperfective tenses:\n\nTenses in the subjunctive mood usually imply dependence on a subordinate clause and might express uncertainty or supposition.\n\nRegular Catalan verbs have the following perfective tenses (formed with the auxiliary verb \"haver\" and the past participle of the conjugated verb), which correspond with those above:\n\nThe perfective tense in the indicative mood has two remote-past forms, analogous to the English simple past. The most common is the periphrastic preterite (\"pretèrit perfet perifràstic\"), a compound tense formed with conjugations of a special present indicative of \"anar\" (\"go\", used exclusively in the formation of this tense) followed by the infinitive of the conjugated verb (\"vaig parlar\", \"I spoke\"; \"vas parlar\" or \"vares parlar\", \"you [singular informal] spoke\"). This special form of \"anar\" always uses the stem \"va-\" and can also use the affix -\"re-\" when the regular preterite suffix corresponding to the desired person has it. As a consequence of always using \"va-\", \"vau\"/\"vàreu\" and \"vam\"/\"vàrem\" are used to form the periphrastic past, instead of \"aneu\" and \"anem\". The periphrastic preterite may also be used in the subjunctive mood, but this only occurs as a literary tense and sporadically in any case; instead, the simple past subjunctive is normally used. The normative Central Catalan and Valencian forms of \"anar\" used to form this tense are outlined in the table below.\n\nThe other tense expressing the remote past is the simple preterite (\"pretèrit perfet simple\"), now used almost exclusively in writing: \"parlí\" (\"I spoke\"), \"parlares\" (\"you (singular informal) spoke\").\n\nThe imperative present (\"present d'imperatiu\"), with two forms, exists outside the imperfective–perfective contrast: one for second-person singular and the other for second-person plural (\"parla!\", \"you [singular] speak!\"; \"parleu!\", \"you [plural] speak!\"). For other persons, the subjunctive present is used: \"parli!\" (\"let him/her speak!\"), \"parlem!\" (\"let us speak!\"), \"parlin!\" (\"let them speak!\"). The imperative is used for positive commands; negative commands use the present subjunctive preceded by \"no\": \"no parlis!\" (\"don't (you) (singular informal) speak!\"), \"no parlem!\" (\"let us not speak!\"), \"no parleu!\" (\"don't (you) (plural) speak!\").\n\nThe differences in meaning and usage distribution of the Catalan recent past (indefinite preterite or present perfect) and remote past (periphrastic past and synthetic preterite) are similar to those of the British English present perfect and simple past. Using the recent past implies that the action was performed sometime in the past, completed during the period of speech and its effects are still present; the remote past implies that action was performed in the past and its effects are no longer present.\n\nIn conditional clauses, verb tenses are used in these pairs:\n\nOther tense combinations are also possible: \"si heu vist el que ha passat, ens ho heu d'explicar\" (\"if you have seen what has happened, you must tell us\"). Temporary and relative subordinate clauses are formed in the future tense: \"quan vindràs, en parlarem\" (\"when you will come, we will speak about it\"), \"els qui vindran d'hora podran seure\" (\"those arriving early will be able to sit\"); though, in the contemporary language, the present subjunctive is used as well, \"quan vinguis ...\" (\"when you come ...\"), \"els qui vinguin ...\" (\"those who come ...\").\n\nCatalan verbs have three non-finite forms: an infinitive, a gerund, and a past participle.\n\nThe infinitive is used with present-indicative forms of \"anar\" (to go) to form the periphrastic preterite: \"vaig parlar\" (\"I spoke\"). A gerund, which is unvarying, functions as an adverb; it is used to form non-finite adjunct adverbial clauses of time or manner, roughly corresponding to the present participle in English.\n\nThe past participle, a verbal adjective, may inflect for gender and number in certain constructions. It is used with the auxiliary \"haver\" (\"to have\") to form the perfect of the simple tenses: simple present \"parlo\" (\"I speak, I'm speaking\") and present perfect \"he parlat\" (\"I've spoken\"). In the compound perfect tenses of transitive verbs (those with a direct object), a past participle may inflect to match gender and number of the object.\n\nIn Old Catalan and some modern varieties the compound perfect tenses of intransitive verbs (those without a direct object) can also be formed with the auxiliary \"ser\" (\"to be\") and the past participle, inflected for gender and number of the subject: \"som arribats\" (\"we have arrived\", switching to masculine plural); the typical contemporary construction is \"hem arribat\", with an invariable participle. This construction remains in only a few vestigial forms: \"és mort/és morta\" (\"he's dead/she's dead\").\n\nInfinitives can be used to make the periphrastic near future with the present of \"anar\" (to go) plus the preposition \"a\" (to): \"vaig a parlar\" (\"I am going to speak\"). This near future is used less often than it is in Spanish or French, because it may be confused with the Catalan periphrastic past. Infinitives can also be used to make periphrastic forms with a range of modal verbs: \"puc parlar\" (\"I can speak\"), \"he/haig de parlar\" (\"I must/have to speak\"), \"necessito parlar\" (\"I need to speak\"), \"vull parlar\" (\"I want to speak\"), \"solia parlar\" (\"I used to speak\"). Gerunds can be used to make periphrastic forms analogous to continuous tenses in English: \"estic parlant\" (\"I'm speaking\"), \"estava parlant\" (\"I was speaking\"), \"estaré parlant\" (\"I will be speaking\"). Past participles are also used with the auxiliary \"ser\" (\"to be\") to form the passive forms for all active tenses of transitive verbs: active present \"veig\" (\"I see, I'm seeing\") in relation to passive present \"sóc vist\" (\"I'm seen, I'm being seen\"), recent past \"he vist\" (\"I've seen\") in relation to passive recent past \"he estat vist\" (\"I've been seen\").\n\nCatalan uses the passive voice less often than English does because it has syntactic alternatives; instead of \"la vaca ha estat vista\" (\"the cow has been seen\"), other constructions could be used such as changing word order and using a redundant weak pronoun to mark object case: \"la vaca, l'han vista\" (\"the cow, [they] have seen it\"); using the third-person reflexive weak pronoun \"es\" (\"s'ha vist la vaca\", literally \"the cow has seen itself\"); using the pronoun \"hom\", one or someone (\"hom ha vist la vaca\", \"one has seen the cow\"), or using an elliptic plural subject (\"han vist la vaca\", \"they have seen the cow\").\n\nAbout 86 percent of Catalan verbs belong to this group. Examples include \"estimar\" (\"to love\"), \"esperar\" (\"to wait\" and \"to hope\"), \"menjar\" (\"to eat\") and \"pensar\" (\"to think\"). This is the only open verb class; new verbs incorporated into the language are likely to follow this conjugation model. The only irregular verbs in this class are the idiosyncratic \"anar\" (\"to go\") and \"estar\" (\"to be, to stay\"), which often act as auxiliary verbs.\n\nThis is the third-largest group of verbs in Catalan, encompassing about four percent of the verbs in the dictionary. It includes most of the irregular verbs, the most-frequently-used: \"ser\" (\"to be\"), \"haver\" (\"to have\"), \"fer\" (\"to do\"), \"veure\" (\"to see\"), \"poder\" (\"can\"), \"voler\" (\"to want\"), \"caldre\" (\"must\"), \"dir\" (\"to say\") and \"dur\" (\"to take/get\").\n\nIn verbs whose infinitive ends in -\"re\", the letter preceding -\"re\" is always a consonant (\"b, d, p, t\") or a consonantal \"u\". Examples include \"beure\" (\"to drink\"), \"caure\" (\"to fall\"), \"coure\" (\"to cook\"),\"deure\" (\"to owe\", also modal \"might\"), \"fotre\" (\"fuck\"), \"jeure\" (\"to lay down\"), \"perdre\" (\"to lose\"), \"rebre\" (\"to receive\"), \"rompre\" (\"break\"), \"valdre\" (\"to be worth\"), \"vendre\" (\"to sell\"), and \"viure\" (\"to live\").\n\nThe final consonantal \"u\" in infinitive roots of this verb class is a characteristic Catalan evolution of several consonantal clusters from Vulgar Latin: CÁDERE > *cad're > caure, DÉBERE > *dev're > deure, VÍVERE > *viv're > viure, CÓQUERE > *cog're > coure. The clusters -\"ldr\"-, -\"ndr\"- in infinitive roots of this verb class have an epenthetic \"d\" as the result of the evolution of consonantal clusters from Vulgar Latin: VÁLERE > val're > valdre, VÉNDERE > *ven're > vendre. If the root consonant in the infinitive is \"b\", the third-person singular indicative present will be spelt with a \"p\"; \"rebre\" becomes \"rep\".\n\nSome verbs in this group have a suppletive root with a velar augment (adding -\"g\"- or -\"c\" to the basic root) in some forms, most frequently past participle, first person of indicative present, and all forms of indicative preterite, subjunctive present and subjunctive preterite: \"valdre\" gives \"valgut\", \"valc\", \"valguí\", \"valgui\", \"valgués\"; \"voler\" gives \"volgut\", \"vull\" or \"vullc\", \"volguí\", \"vulgui\", \"volgués\".\n\nThis is the second-largest group of regular verbs in the Catalan language (about 10 percent of verbs in the dictionary). Most regular verbs in the group (about 91 percent) are inchoative, deriving from the Latin inchoative suffix -\"ESC\"-. The varied suffixes (\"eix\"-, -\"ix\"-, -\"esc\"-, -\"isc\"- , , , ), depending on tense and dialect), which carry the stress, is added to the root in the imperative second-person singular and the first-, second- and third-person singular and third-person plural of the indicative and subjunctive present: \"servir\" gives the imperative second-person singular \"serveix!\", third-person singular indicative present \"serveix\" and the third-person singular subjunctive present \"serveixi\".\n\nThese verbs have basic (\"serv-\") and extended stems (\"serveix-\", \"servix-\", \"servesc-\" or \"servisc-\"), used in particular tenses. Examples of inchoative verbs include \"patir\" (\"to suffer/endure\") and \"partir\" (\"to divide\"), which give the third-person singular indicative present of \"pateix\" and \"parteix\" respectively.\n\nExamples of non-inchoative verbs include \"fugir\" (\"to flee\") and \"morir\" (\"to die\"), which give third-person singular indicative presents of \"fuig\" and \"mor\" respectively.\n\nThis auxiliary verb presents several different roots: s-, ess-, er-, sig- (from Latin ESSE), and for-, foss, fu- (from Latin perfect forms of ESSE, which had analogous suppletive roots).\n\nThis auxiliary verb has several different roots: h-, hav- and hag- (either or ) (all from Latin HABERE). There are more dialectal forms with a velar augment based on the root hag-.\n\n\"Anar\" has two roots: ana-, ani- (from Latin AMBULARE, the second a mix with Latin IRE) and va-, vag- (from Latin VADERE). The present of \"anar\" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the periphrastic preterite with the infinitive of the verb being conjugated. The forms of \"anar\" as an auxiliary verb are slightly different from the normal present tense. The first- and second-person plural forms are different; the auxiliary verb forms are \"vam\" and \"vau\" (or \"vem\" and \"veu\", depending on dialect), and the full verb forms are \"anem\" and \"aneu\" (or \"anam\" and \"anau\", depending on dialect).\n\nThis irregular verb presents several different roots: fe-, fa-, fac- (from the Latin FACERE). There are more dialectal (and non-standard) forms based on the root fag- , similar to \"haver\" (for example, in the central Catalan subjunctive present).\n\nThis irregular verb presents several different roots: di-, diu- , dei- , dig- , dic- (all from Latin DICERE). There are more dialectal forms with a velar augment based on the root dig-, especially in the Balearic dialects.\n\nThis irregular verb has several different roots: du-, dui- , dug- , duc- (all from Latin DUCERE). There are more dialectal forms with a velar augment based on the root dug-, especially in the Balearic dialects.\n\n\n\n"}

The Cearbhall Óg who composed 'Eileanóir a Rún' was from Pallas, near Gorey in County Wexford. The Eileanóir of the poem was the daughter of Sir Morgan Kavanagh of Poll an Mhóintigh in County Wexford. In folklore Cearbhall is commonly depicted as a womanizer.\n\nIrish folklore recounts how Eileanóir Chaomhánach eloped with Cearbhall the day she was about to marry another man. Cearbhall arrived at the wedding to play music at the wedding feast, and fell in love with the bride. He composed the song Eileanoir a Rún to woo the bride.\nAnother song, in the style of the crosántacht, \"Seachrán Chearbhaill\", is ascribed to Cearbhall Óg. Both, a poem by the Dominican priest Pádraigín Haicéad. addressed to Cearbhall, and Cearbhall's poem in response, survive in a 17th-century manuscript. The story \"Mac na Míchomhairle\" (The Son of Poor Council) has been ascribed to him in folklore, but current scholarship casts doubt on this ascription.\n\nA version of Seachrán Chearbhaill by Joe Éinniu Seosamh Ó hÉanaí is available on a CD with the book \"Joe Éinniu: Nár fhágha mé Bás Choíche\" by Liam Mac Con Iomaire (Cló Iarchonnachta 2007); and a later recording of an earlier version of the song on Peadar Ó Ceannabháin's CD, \"Mo Chuid den tSaol\" (Cló-Iarchonnachta).

{"id": "190835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190835", "title": "Coevolution", "text": "Coevolution\n\nIn biology, coevolution occurs when two or more species reciprocally affect each other's evolution.\n\nCharles Darwin mentioned evolutionary interactions between flowering plants and insects in \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution can play an important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.\n\nEach party in a coevolutionary relationship exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, is not the only possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.\n\nCoevolution is primarily a biological concept, but researchers have applied it by analogy to fields such as computer science, sociology, and astronomy.\n\nCoevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other, sometimes creating a mutualistic relationship between the species. Such relationships can be of many different types.\n\nFlowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record, creating what Charles Darwin described as the \"abominable mystery\" of how they had evolved so quickly; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation. He first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in \"On the Origin of Species\", and developed the concept further in \"Fertilisation of Orchids\" (1862).\n\nModern insect-pollinated (entomophilous) flowers are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen. The two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years, creating a complex network of interactions. Either they evolved together, or at some later stages they came together, likely with pre-adaptations, and became mutually adapted. The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964, to describe the evolutionary interactions of plants and butterflies.\n\nSeveral highly successful insect groups—especially the Hymenoptera (wasps, bees and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies) as well as many types of Diptera (flies) and Coleoptera (beetles)—evolved in conjunction with flowering plants during the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago). The earliest bees, important pollinators today, appeared in the early Cretaceous. A group of wasps sister to the bees evolved at the same time as flowering plants, as did the Lepidoptera. Further, all the major clades of bees first appeared between the middle and late Cretaceous, simultaneously with the adaptive radiation of the eudicots (three quarters of all angiosperms), and at the time when the angiosperms became the world's dominant plants on land.\n\nAt least three aspects of flowers appear to have coevolved between flowering plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.\n\nThe yucca, \"Yucca whipplei\", is pollinated exclusively by \"Tegeticula maculata\", a yucca moth that depends on the yucca for survival. The moth eats the seeds of the plant, while gathering pollen. The pollen has evolved to become very sticky, and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower. The yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs, deep within the flower away from potential predators.\n\nHummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers have evolved a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar suited to the birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The blooming times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers also tend to be more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species can be attributed to the direction of the shift in pollinator preference.\n\nFlowers have converged to take advantage of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.\nThis meets the birds' high energy requirements, the most important determinants of flower choice. In \"Mimulus\", an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination. Therefore, red pigments in the flowers of \"Mimulus cardinalis\" may function primarily to discourage bee visitation. In \"Penstemon\", flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird' adaptations, but adaptation 'towards' birds and 'away' from bees can happen simultaneously. However, some flowers such as \"Heliconia angusta\" appear not to be as specifically ornithophilous as had been supposed: the species is occasionally (151 visits in 120 hours of observation) visited by \"Trigona\" stingless bees. These bees are largely pollen robbers in this case, but may also serve as pollinators.\n\nFollowing their respective breeding seasons, several species of hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill in a particular way when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.\n\nOrnithophilous flowers need to be conspicuous to birds. Birds have their greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the visual spectrum, so red is particularly conspicuous to them. Hummingbirds may also be able to see ultraviolet \"colors\". The prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous (insect-pollinated) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers. Each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds, the Phaethornithinae (hermits) and the Trochilinae, has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers. Most Phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs, while the Trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species.\nThe genus \"Ficus\" is composed of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their syconiums, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside. Each fig species has its own fig wasp which (in most cases) pollinates the fig, so a tight mutual dependence has evolved and persisted throughout the genus.\n\nThe acacia ant (\"Pseudomyrmex ferruginea\") is an obligate plant ant that protects at least five species of \"Acacia\" (\"Vachellia\") from preying insects and from other plants competing for sunlight, and the tree provides nourishment and shelter for the ant and its larvae. Such mutualism is not automatic: other ant species exploit trees without reciprocating, following different evolutionary strategies. These cheater ants impose important host costs via damage to tree reproductive organs, though their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast.\n\nHost–parasite coevolution is the coevolution of a host and a parasite. A general characterization of many viruses, obligate parasites, is that they coevolved alongside their respective hosts. Correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race. Whichever organism, host or parasite, that cannot keep up with the other will be eliminated from their habitat, as the species with the higher average population fitness survives. This race is known as the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction allows a host to stay just ahead of its parasite, similar to the Red Queen's race in \"Through the Looking-Glass\": \"it takes all the running \"you\" can do, to keep in the same place\". The host reproduces sexually, producing some offspring with immunity over its parasite, which then evolves in response.\n\nThe parasite/host relationship probably drove the prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords a better chance of developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.\n\nBrood parasitism demonstrates close coevolution of host and parasite, for example in cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.\n\nAntagonistic coevolution is seen in the harvester ant species \"Pogonomyrmex barbatus\" and \"Pogonomyrmex rugosus\", in a relationship both parasitic and mutualistic. The queens are unable to produce worker ants by mating with their own species. Only by crossbreeding can they produce workers. The winged females act as parasites for the males of the other species as their sperm will only produce sterile hybrids. But because the colonies are fully dependent on these hybrids to survive, it is also mutualistic. While there is no genetic exchange between the species, they are unable to evolve in a direction where they become too genetically different as this would make crossbreeding impossible.\n\nPredators and prey interact and coevolve, the predator to catch the prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.\n\nThe same applies to herbivores, animals that eat plants, and the plants that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red squirrels and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, making it more difficult for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.\n\nBoth intraspecific competition, with features such as sexual conflict and sexual selection, and interspecific competition, such as between predators, may be able to drive coevolution.\n\nThe types of coevolution listed so far have been described as if they operated pairwise (also called specific coevolution), in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This is not always the case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is called guild or diffuse coevolution. For instance, a trait in several species of flowering plant, such as offering its nectar at the end of a long tube, can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including bees, flies, and beetles, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.\n\nCoevolution is primarily a biological concept, but has been applied to other fields by analogy.\n\nCoevolutionary algorithms are used for generating artificial life as well as for optimization, game learning and machine learning. Daniel Hillis added \"co-evolving parasites\" to prevent an optimization procedure from becoming stuck at local maxima. Karl Sims coevolved virtual creatures.\n\nThe concept of coevolution was introduced in architecture by the Danish architect-urbanist Henrik Valeur as an antithesis to the concept of \"star-architecture\". As the curator of the Danish Pavilion at the 2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture he conceived and orchestrated an exhibition project named 'Co-evolution', awarded the Golden Lion for Best National Pavilion.\n\nThe exhibition included urban planning projects for the cities of Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai and Xi'an, which had been developed in collaboration between young professional Danish architects and students and professors and students from leading universities in the four Chinese cities. By creating a framework for collaboration between academics and professionals representing two distinct cultures, it was hoped that the exchange of knowledge, ideas and experiences would stimulate \"creativity and imagination to set the spark for new visions for sustainable urban development.\" Valeur later argued that: \"As we become more and more interconnected and interdependent, human development is no longer a matter of the evolution of individual groups of people but rather a matter of the co-evolution of all people.\"\nComputer software and hardware can be considered as two separate components but tied intrinsically by coevolution. Similarly, operating systems and computer applications, web browsers and web applications.\n\nAll of these systems depend upon each other and advance step by step through a kind of evolutionary process. Changes in hardware, an operating system or web browser may introduce new features that are then incorporated into the corresponding applications running alongside. The idea is closely related to the concept of \"joint optimization\" in sociotechnical systems analysis and design, where a system is understood to consist of both a \"technical system\" encompassing the tools and hardware used for production and maintenance, and a \"social system\" of relationships and procedures through which the technology is tied into the goals of the system and all the other human and organizational relationships within and outside the system. Such systems work best when the technical and social systems are deliberately developed together.\n\nModels of coevolution have been proposed for sociology and international political economy. Richard Norgaard's 2006 book \"Development Betrayed\" proposes a \"Co-Evolutionary Revisioning of the Future\" of social and economic life.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2947537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2947537", "title": "Contact sport", "text": "Contact sport\n\nContact sports are sports that emphasize or require physical contact between players. Some sports, such as mixed martial arts, are scored on impacting an opponent, while others, including rugby require tackling of players. These sports are often known as full-contact, as the sport cannot be undertaken without contact. Other sports have contact, but such events are illegal under the rules of the game or are accidental and do not form part of the sport.\n\nThe contact in contact sports can also include impact via a piece of sporting equipment, such as being struck by a hockey stick or football. Non-contact sports are those where participants should have no possible means of touching, such as sprinting, swimming, darts or snooker, where players use separate lanes or take turns of play. Consideration should also be given to other sports such as Moto-cross and Bicycle Moto-cross (BMX) and cycling which all involve riding/racing in packs of riders. This often results in brushing and bumping off other riders.\n\nCurrent medical terminology in the United States uses the term collision sport to refer to sports like rugby, roller derby, American football, ice hockey, and lacrosse, the term contact sport to refer to sports such as Association football and basketball, and the term limited-contact sport to sports like squash and baseball.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement revised in 2008 included the following definitions:\n\nMany sports will penalize contact with rules for certain situations or instances to help reduce the incidence of physical trauma or litigation for assault or grievous bodily harm.\nMany sports involve a degree of player-to-player or player-to-object contact. The term \"contact sport\" is used in both team sports and combat activities, medical terminology and television game shows, such as American Gladiators and Wipeout, to certain degrees. Contact between players is often classed by different grades ranging from non-contact, where there is no contact between players, to full-contact or collision sports, where the rules allow for significant physical contact.\n\nInjuries in some contact sports have been fatal. Injury rates in professional rugby league are higher than in some other contact sports.\n\nAs a result of the risk of injury, some sports require the use of protective equipment, for example American football protective equipment or the gloves and helmets needed for underwater hockey. Some sports are also played on soft ground and have padding on physical obstacles, such as goal posts.\n\nMost contact sports require any male players to wear a Abdominal Guard to protect their male genitalia.\n\nThe cost of equipment can be an obstacle to participating in many sports.\n\nBecause of issues involved with any sport that involves rapid contact, many sports governing bodies are changing their rules to decrease the incidence of serious injury. An example of this is the NFL banning concussed players from re-entering the same game in which they were injured in order to decrease further damage.\n\nA (full) contact sport is any sport for which significant physical impact force on players, either deliberate or incidental, is allowed or within the rules of the game.\n\nContact actions include tackling, blocking and a whole range of other moves that can differ substantially in their rules and degree of application.\n\nExamples of contact sports are roller derby, rugby league, rugby union, American football, Canadian football, water polo, kabaddi, hurling, shinty, Australian rules football, ice hockey, wheelchair rugby and Combat football.\n\nFull-contact martial arts include wrestling, Sanshou, sumo, boxing, mixed martial arts, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, judo, various forms of full contact karate, and some forms of Taekwondo.\nA semi-contact sport is typically a combat sport involving striking and containing physical contact between the combatants simulating full-power techniques. The techniques are restricted to limited power, and rendering the opponent unconscious is forbidden.\n\nSome semi-contact sports use a point system to determine the winner and use extensive protective gear to protect the athletes from injury. Examples of semi-contact sports include karate, kalaripayattu, kickboxing, various Chinese martial arts that incorporate contact rules sparring, kendo and taekwondo\n\nAnother indicator of a semi-contact martial arts competition system is that after a point is rewarded the adversaries will be separated and resume the match from safe distance, but often it is possible to argue if some martial arts sports belong in one contact group or another.\n\nLimited-contact sports are sports for which the rules are specifically designed to prevent contact between players either intentionally or unintentionally. Contact can still happen, but penalties are often used to disallow substantial contact between players. These penalties, including physically removing players from the field of play, mean that contact is moderate or rare.\n\nExamples include association football, basketball, baseball, softball, field hockey, women's lacrosse, netball, korfball, Gaelic football, polo, ultimate, bandy, and underwater hockey.\n\nNon-contact sports are sports where participants compete alternately in lanes or are physically separated such as to make it nearly impossible for them to make contact during the course of a game without committing an out-of-bounds offense or, more likely, disqualification. Examples include volleyball, cricket, tennis, Howden Clough 6-A-Side Football, golf, bowling, bowls, croquet, pool, snooker, darts, curling, bodybuilding, swimming, diving, running, sprinting, gymnastics and rowing.\n"}
{"id": "312710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312710", "title": "Cumbric", "text": "Cumbric\n\nCumbric was a variety of the Common Brittonic language spoken during the Early Middle Ages in the \"Hen Ogledd\" or \"Old North\" in what is now Northern England and southern Lowland Scotland. It was closely related to Old Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. Place name evidence suggests Cumbric may also have been spoken as far south as Pendle and the Yorkshire Dales. The prevailing view is that it became extinct in the 12th century, after the incorporation of the semi-independent Kingdom of Strathclyde into the Kingdom of Scotland.\n\nDauvit Broun sets out the problems with the various terms used to describe the Cumbric language and its speakers. The people seem to have called themselves \"*Cumbri\" the same way that the Welsh call themselves \"Cymry\" (most likely from Brittonic \"*kom-brogī\" meaning \"fellow countrymen\"). The Welsh and the Cumbric-speaking people of what are now southern Scotland and northern England likely felt they were actually one ethnic group. Old Irish speakers called them \"Britons\", \"Bretnach\", or \"Bretain\". The Norse called them \"Brettar\". In Medieval Latin, the English term Wales and the term \"Cumbri\" were Latinised respectively as \"Wallenses\" \"of Wales\" and \"Cumbrenses\" \"of Cumbria\". The usual English usage was to call them Welsh. In Scots, a Cumbric speaker seems to have been called \"Wallace\", from the Scots \"Wallis/Wellis\" \"Welsh\".\n\nThe Latinate term Cambria is often used for Wales; nevertheless, the \"Life of St Kentigern\" by Jocelyn of Furness has the following passage:\n\nJohn T. Koch defines the specifically Cumbric region as \"the area approximately between the line of the River Mersey and the Forth-Clyde Isthmus\", but goes on to include evidence from the Wirral Peninsula in his discussion and does not define its easterly extent. Kenneth Jackson describes Cumbric as \"the Brittonic dialect of Cumberland, Westmorland, northern Lancashire, and south-west Scotland...\" and goes on to define the region further as being bound in the north by the Firth of Clyde, in the south by the River Ribble and in the east by the Southern Scottish Uplands and the Pennine Ridge.\n\nThe evidence from Cumbric comes almost entirely through secondary sources, since no contemporary written records of the language are known. The majority of evidence comes from place names of the extreme northwest of England and the south of Scotland. Other sources include the personal names of Strathclyde Britons in Scottish, Irish, and Anglo-Saxon sources, and a few Cumbric words surviving into the High Middle Ages in southwest Scotland as legal terms. Although the language is long extinct, traces of its vocabulary arguably have persisted into the modern era in the form of \"counting scores\" and in a handful of dialectal words.\n\nFrom this scanty evidence, little can be deduced about the singular characteristics of Cumbric, not even the name by which its speakers referred to it. What is generally agreed upon by linguists is that Cumbric was a Western Brittonic language closely related to Welsh and, more distantly, to Cornish and Breton.\n\nAround the time of the battle described in the poem \"Y Gododdin\", Common Brittonic was believed to be transitioning into its daughter languages: Cumbric in North Britain, Old Welsh in Wales, and Southwestern Brittonic, the ancestor of Cornish and Breton. Kenneth Jackson concludes that the majority of changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the fifth to the end of the sixth century. This involved syncope and the loss of final syllables. If the poem dates to this time, it would have been written in an early form of Cumbric, the usual name for the Brythonic speech of the Hen Ogledd. Jackson suggested the name \"Primitive Cumbric\" for the dialect spoken at the time.\n\nCumbric place names are found in Scotland south of the firths of Forth and Clyde. Brittonic names north of this line are Pictish. They are also found commonly in the historic county of Cumberland and bordering areas of Northumberland. They are less common in Westmorland, with some in Lancashire and the adjoining areas of North Yorkshire. Approaching Cheshire, late Brittonic placenames are probably better described as being Welsh rather than Cumbric. As noted below, however, any clear distinction between Cumbric and Welsh is difficult to prove. For references see Armstrong et al., Watson and Jackson. Many Brittonic place-names remain in northern England, which should not be described as Cumbric because they originated from a period before Brittonic split into its daughter dialects e.g. Welsh, Cornish, Breton and – arguably – Cumbric.\n\nSome of the principal towns and cities of the region have names of Cumbric origin, including:\n\nSeveral supposed Cumbric elements occur repeatedly in place names of the region. The following table lists some of them according to the modern Welsh equivalent:\n\nSome Cumbric names have historically \nbeen replaced by Gaelic or English equivalents and in some cases the different forms occur in the historical record.\n\nAmong the evidence that Cumbric served as a substratum that influenced local English dialects are a group of counting systems, or scores, recorded in various parts of northern England. Around 100 of these systems have been collected since the 18th century; the scholarly consensus is that these derive from a Brittonic language closely related to Welsh. Though they are often referred to as \"sheep-counting numerals\", most recorded scores were not used to count sheep, but in knitting or for children's games or nursery rhymes. These scores are often suggested to represent a survival from medieval Cumbric, a theory first popularized in the 19th century. However, later scholars came to reject this idea, suggesting instead that the scores were later imports from either Wales or Scotland, but in light of the dearth of evidence for any of these theories, Markku Filppula, Juhani Klemola, and Heli Paulasto note that it remains plausible that the counting systems are indeed of Cumbric origin.\n\nA number of words occurring in the Scots and Northern English variants of English have been proposed as being of possible Brittonic origin. Ascertaining the real derivation of these words is far from simple, due in part to the similarities between some cognates in the Brittonic and Goidelic languages and the fact that borrowing took place in both directions between these languages. Another difficulty lies with other words which were taken into Old English, as in many cases it is impossible to tell whether the borrowing is directly from Brittonic or not (see Brogat, Crag). The following are possibilities:\n\nThe linguistic term Cumbric is defined according to geographical rather than linguistic criteria: that is, it refers to the variety of Brittonic spoken within a particular region of North Britain and implies nothing about that variety except that it was geographically distinct from other varieties. This has led to a discussion about the nature of Cumbric and its relationship with other Brittonic languages, in particular with Old Welsh.\n\nLinguists appear undecided as to whether Cumbric should be considered a separate language, or a dialect of Old Welsh. Koch calls it a dialect but goes on to say that some of the place names in the Cumbric region \"clearly reflect a developed medieval language, much like Welsh, Cornish or Breton\". Jackson also calls it a dialect but points out that \"to call it Pr[imitive] W[elsh] would be inaccurate\", so clearly views it as distinct in some meaningful respect.\n\nIt has been suggested that Cumbric was more closely aligned to the Pictish language than to Welsh, though there is considerable debate regarding the classification of that language. On the basis of place name evidence it has also been proposed that all three languages were very similar.\n\nThe whole question is made more complex because there is no consensus as to whether any principled distinction can be made between languages and dialects.\n\nBelow, some of the proposed differences between Cumbric and Old Welsh are discussed.\n\nIn Welsh, Cornish, and Breton, the Common Brittonic cluster \"*rk\" was spirantized to (Welsh \"rch\", Cornish \"rgh\", Breton \"rc'h\") but a number of place names appear to show Cumbric retained the stop in this position. Lanark and Lanercost are thought to contain the equivalent of Welsh \"llannerch\" 'clearing'.\n\nThere is evidence to the contrary, however, including the place names Powmaughan and Maughanby (containing Welsh \"Meirchion\") and the word \"kelchyn\" (related to Welsh \"cylch\"). Jackson concludes that the change of Common Brittonic \"*rk\" > /rx/ \"\"may\" have been somewhat later in Cumbric\".\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the consonant cluster \"mb\" remained distinct in Cumbric later than the time it was assimilated to \"mm\" in Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. The cluster remains in:\n\nJackson notes that only in the north does the cluster appear in place names borrowed after \"circa\" 600AD and concludes that it may have been a later dialectal survival here.\n\nJackson notes the legal term \"galnys\", equivalent to Welsh \"galanas\", may show syncope of internal syllables to be a feature of Cumbric. Further evidence is wanting, however.\n\nJames mentions that devoicing appears to be a feature of many Cumbric place names. Devoicing of word final consonants is a feature of modern Breton and, to an extent, Cornish. Watson notes initial devoicing in Tinnis Castle (in Drumelzier) (compare Welsh \"dinas\" 'fortress, city') as an example of this, which can also be seen in the Cornish Tintagel, \"din\" 'fort'. Also notable are the different English names of two Welsh towns named \"Dinbych\" ('little fort'); Denbigh and Tenby.\n\nThere is also a significant number of place names which do not support this theory. Devoke Water and Cumdivock (< \"Dyfoc\", according to Ekwall) and Derwent (< Common Brittonic \"Derwentiō\") all have initial /d/. The name Calder (< Brit. \"*Caletodubro-\") in fact appears to show a voiced Cumbric consonant where Welsh has \"Calettwr\" by provection, which Jackson believes reflects an earlier stage of pronunciation. Jackson also notes that Old English had no internal or final /g/, so would be borrowed with /k/ by sound substitution. This can be seen in names with \"c, k, ck\" (e.g. Cocker < Brittonic \"*kukro-\", Eccles < Brittonic \"eglēsia\").\n\nThe Cumbric personal names Gospatrick, Gososwald and Gosmungo meaning 'servant of St...' (Welsh, Cornish, Breton \"gwas\" 'servant, boy') and the Galloway dialect word \"gossock\" 'short, dark haired inhabitant of Wigtownshire' (W. \"gwasog\" 'a servant') apparently show that the Cumbric equivalent of Welsh and Cornish \"gwas\" & B \"gwaz\" 'servant' was \"*gos\". Jackson suggests that it may be a survival of the original Proto-Celtic form of the word in –o- (i.e. \"*uɸo-sto\").\n\nThis idea is disputed by the \"Dictionary of the Scots Language\"; and the occurrence in Gospatrick's Writ of the word \"wassenas\" 'dependants', thought to be from the same word \"gwas\", is evidence against Jackson's theory. Koch notes that the alternation between \"gwa-\" and \"go-\" is common among the Brittonic languages and does not amount to a systematic sound change in any of them.\n\nIn the \"Book of Aneirin\", a poem entitled \" \"Peis Dinogat\" \" (possibly set in the Lake District of Cumbria), contains a usage of the word \"penn\" \"head\" (attached to the names of several animals hunted by the protagonist), that is unique in medieval Welsh literature and may, according to Koch, reflect Cumbric influence (\"[r]eferring to a single animal in this way is otherwise found only in Breton, and we have no evidence that the construction ever had any currency in the present-day Wales\"). The relevant lines are:\n\nTranslated as:\n\nThe form \"derwennydd\" however, is at odds with the absence of the ending \"-ydd\" noted below.\n\nThe modern Brittonic languages have different forms of the definite article: Welsh \"yr, -'r, y\", Cornish \"an\", and Breton \"an, ar, al\". These are all taken to derive from an unstressed form of the Common Brittonic demonstrative \"*sindos\", altered by assimilation (compare the Gaelic articles). Throughout Old Welsh the article is \"ir\" (or \"-r\" after a vowel), but there is evidence in Cumbric for an article in \"-n\" alongside one in \"-r\". Note the following:\n\n\nOf all the names of possible Cumbric derivation, few are more certain than Carlisle and Derwent which can be directly traced back to their Romano-British recorded forms \"Luguvalium\" and \"Derventio\".\n\nThe modern and medieval forms of Carlisle (\"Luel\" c1050, \"Cardeol\" 1092, \"Karlioli\" c1100 (in the Medieval Latin genitive case), \"Cærleoil\" 1130) and Derwent (\"Deorwentan stream\" c890 (Old English), \"Derewent\") suggest derivations from Br *\"Luguvaljon\" and \"*Derwentjō\". But the Welsh forms \"Caerliwelydd\" and \"Derwennydd\" are derived from alternative forms \"*Luguvalijon, *Derwentijō\" which gave the \"-ydd\" ending. This appears to show a divergence between Cumbric and Welsh at a relatively early date.\n\nIf this was an early dialectal variation, it can't be applied as a universal sound law, as the equivalent of W \"mynydd\" 'mountain' occurs in a number of Cumbric names with the spirant intact: E.g. Mindrum (\"Minethrum\" 1050) from 'mountain ridge' (Welsh \"mynydd trum\"). It might also be noted that Medieval Welsh forms of \"Caerliwelydd\"\nand \"Derwennydd\" both occur in poems of supposed Cumbrian origin whose rhyme and metre would be disrupted if the ending were absent.\n\nOne particularly distinctive element of Cumbric is the repeated use of the element \"Gos-\" or \"Cos-\" (W. \"gwas\" 'boy, lad; servant, attendant') in personal names, followed by the name of a saint. The practice is reminiscent of Gaelic names such as \"Maol Choluim\" \"Malcolm\" and \"Gille Crìosd\" \"Gilchrist\", which have Scottish Gaelic \"maol\" (Old Irish \"máel\" 'bald, tonsured; servant') and \"gille\" (\"servant, lad', < Old Irish \"gilla\" 'a youth').\n\nThe most well-known example of this Cumbric naming practice is \"Gospatric\", which occurs as the name of several notable Anglo-Scottish noblemen in the 11th and 12th centuries. Other examples, standardised from original sources, include \"Gosmungo\" (Saint Mungo), \"Gososwald\" (Oswald of Northumbria) and \"Goscuthbert\" (Cuthbert).\n\nIt is impossible to give an exact date of the extinction of Cumbric. However, there are some pointers which may give a reasonably accurate estimate. In the mid-11th century, some landowners still bore what appear to be Cumbric names. Examples of such landowners are Dunegal (Dyfnwal), lord of Strathnith or Nithsdale; Moryn (Morien), lord of Cardew and Cumdivock near Carlisle; and Eilifr (Eliffer), lord of Penrith.\n\nThere is a village near Carlisle called Cumwhitton (earlier Cumquinton). This appears to contain the Norman name Quinton. There were no Normans in this area until 1069 at the earliest.\n\nIn the Battle of the Standard in 1138, the Cumbrians are noted as a separate ethnic group. Given that their material culture was very similar to their Gaelic and Anglian neighbours, it is arguable that what set them apart was still their language. Also the castle at Castle Carrock – Castell Caerog – dates from around 1160–1170. Barmulloch, earlier Badermonoc (Cumbric \"monk's dwelling\"), was given to the church by Malcolm IV of Scotland between 1153 and 1165.\n\nA more controversial point is the surname Wallace. It means \"Welshman\". It is possible that all the Wallaces in the Clyde area were medieval immigrants from Wales, but given that the term was also used for local Cumbric speaking Strathclyde Welsh it seems equally if not more likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being \"Welsh\" due to their Cumbric language. Surnames in Scotland were not inherited before 1200 and not regularly until 1400. William Wallace (known in Gaelic as Uilleam Breatnach – namely William the Briton or Welshman) came from the Renfrew area – itself a Cumbric name. Wallace slew the sheriff of Lanark (also a Cumbric name) in 1297. Even if he had inherited the surname from his father, it is possible that the family spoke Cumbric within memory in order to be thus named.\n\nThere are also some historical pointers to a continuing separate ethnic identity. Prior to being crowned king of Scotland in 1124, David I was invested with the title Prince of the Cumbrians. William the Lion between 1173–1180 made an address to his subjects, identifying the Cumbrians as a separate group. This does not prove that any of them still spoke Cumbric at this time.\n\nThe legal documents in the Lanercost Cartulary, dating from the late 12th century, show witnesses with Norman French or English names, and no obvious Cumbric names. Though these people represent the upper classes, it seems significant that by the late 12th century in the Lanercost area, Cumbric is not obvious in these personal names. In 1262 in Peebles, jurymen in a legal dispute over peat cutting also have names which mostly appear Norman French or English, but possible exceptions are Gauri Pluchan, Cokin Smith and Robert Gladhoc, where \"Gladhoc\" has the look of an adjective similar to Welsh \"gwladog\" = \"countryman\". In the charters of Wetherall Priory near Carlisle there is a monk called Robert Minnoc who appears as a witness to 8 charters dating from around 1260. His name is variously spelled Minnoc/Minot/Mynoc and it is tempting to see an equivalent of the Welsh \"mynach\" – \"Robert the Monk\" here.\n\nGiven that the Anglicisation of the upper classes in general has happened before the Anglicisation of the peasantry in other areas which have given up speaking Celtic languages it is not implausible that the peasantry continued to speak Cumbric for at least a little while after. Around 1200 there is a list of the names of men living in the area of Peebles. Amongst them are Cumbric names such as Gospatrick: servant or follower of Saint Patrick, Gosmungo: servant of Saint Mungo, Guososwald: servant of Oswald of Northumbria and Goscubrycht: servant of Cuthbert. Two of the saints – Oswald and Cuthbert — are from Northumbria showing influence on Cumbric not found in Welsh.\n\nThe royal seal of Alexander III of Scotland (who reigned 4 September 1241 – 19 March 1286) bore the title \"Rex Scotorum et Britanniarum\", or \"King of Scots and Britons\".\n\nIn 1305 Edward I of England prohibited the \"Leges inter Brettos et Scottos\". The term Brets or Britons refers to the native, traditionally Cumbric speaking people of southern Scotland.\n\nIt seems that Cumbric could well have survived into the middle of the 12th century as a community language and even lasted into the 13th on the tongues of the last remaining speakers. Certain areas seem to be particularly dense in Cumbric place-names even down to very minor features. The two most striking of these are around Lanercost east of Carlisle and around Torquhan south of Edinburgh. If the 1262 names from Peebles do contain traces of Cumbric personal names then we can imagine Cumbric dying out between 1250 and 1300 at the very latest.\n\nIn the 2000s, a group of enthusiasts proposed a revival of the Cumbric language and launched a social networking site and a \"revived Cumbric\" guidebook to promote it, but with little success. Writing in \"Carn\" magazine, Colin Lewis noted that there was disagreement in the group about whether to base \"revived Cumbric\" on the surviving sources for the language or try to reconstruct the form Late Cumbric may have taken after the attested period, but his own suggestion was simply to use Modern Welsh, with its rich literature, culture and history.\n\n\n\n"}

The paradox may be expressed in natural language and in various logics, including certain forms of set theory, lambda calculus, and combinatory logic.\n\nThe paradox is named after the logician Haskell Curry. It has also been called Löb's paradox after Martin Hugo Löb, due to its relationship to Löb's theorem.\n\nClaims of the form \"if A, then B\" are called conditional claims. Curry's paradox uses a particular kind of self-referential conditional sentence, as demonstrated in this example:\n\nEven though Germany does not border China, the example sentence certainly is a natural-language sentence, and so the truth of that sentence can be analyzed. The paradox follows from this analysis. The analysis consists of two steps.\n\n\nThe claim \"Germany borders China\" could be replaced by any other claim, and the sentence would still be provable. Thus every sentence appears to be provable. Because the proof uses only well-accepted methods of deduction, and because none of these methods appears to be incorrect, this situation is paradoxical.\n\nThe standard method for proving conditional sentences (sentences of the form \"if A, then B\") is called a \"conditional proof\". In this method, in order to prove \"if A, then B\", first A is assumed and then with that assumption B is shown to be true.\n\nTo produce Curry's paradox, as described in the two steps above, apply this method to the sentence \"if this sentence is true, then Germany borders China\". Here A, \"this sentence is true\", refers to the overall sentence, while B is \"Germany borders China\". So, assuming A is the same as assuming \"If A, then B\". Therefore, in assuming A, we have assumed both A and \"If A, then B\". Therefore B is true, by modus ponens, and we have proven \"If this sentence is true, then 'Germany borders China' is true.\" in the usual way, by assuming the hypothesis and deriving the conclusion.\n\nNow, because we have proved \"If this sentence is true, then 'Germany borders China' is true\", then\nwe can again apply modus ponens, because we know that the claim \"this sentence is true\" is correct. In this way, we can deduce that Germany borders China.\n\nThe example in the previous section used unformalized, natural-language reasoning. Curry's paradox also occurs in some varieties of formal logic. In this context, it shows that if we assume there is a formal sentence (X → Y), where X itself is equivalent to (X → Y), then we can prove \"Y\" with a formal proof. One example of such a formal proof is as follows. For an explanation of the logic notation used in this section, refer to the list of logic symbols.\n\n\nAn alternative proof is via \"Peirce's law\". If X = X → Y then (X → Y) → X. This together with Peirce's law ((X → Y) → X) → X and \"modus ponens\" implies X and subsequently Y (as in above proof).\n\nTherefore, if Y is an unprovable statement in a formal system, there is no statement X in that system such that X is equivalent to the implication (X → Y). By contrast, the previous section shows that in natural (unformalized) language, for every natural language statement Y there is a natural language statement Z such that Z is equivalent to (Z → Y) in natural language. Namely, Z is \"If this sentence is true then Y\".\n\nIn specific cases where the classification of Y is already known, few steps are needed to reveal the contradiction. For example, when Y is \"Germany borders China,\" it is known that Y is false.\n\n\nEven if the underlying mathematical logic does not admit any self-referential sentences, certain forms of naive set theory are still vulnerable to Curry's paradox. In set theories that allow unrestricted comprehension, we can nevertheless prove any logical statement \"Y\" by examining the set\n\nAssuming that formula_2 takes precedence over both formula_3 and formula_4, the proof proceeds as follows:\n\nStep 4 is the only step invalid in a consistent set theory. In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, an extra hypothesis stating the sethood of \"X\" would be required, which is provable in neither ZF nor in its extension ZFC (with the axiom of choice).\n\nTherefore, in a consistent set theory, the set formula_14 does not exist for false \"Y\". This can be seen as a variant on Russell's paradox, but is not identical. Some proposals for set theory have attempted to deal with Russell's paradox not by restricting the rule of comprehension, but by restricting the rules of logic so that it tolerates the contradictory nature of the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. The existence of proofs like the one above shows that such a task is not so simple, because at least one of the deduction rules used in the proof above must be omitted or restricted.\n\nCurry's paradox may be expressed in Lambda calculus. Consider a function \"r\" defined as\n\nThen (\"r\" \"r\") β-reduces to\n\nIf (\"r\" \"r\") is false, then (\"r\" \"r\") → \"y\" is true by the principle of explosion, which is a contradiction of the equivalence of the β-reduction. So (\"r\" \"r\") is true, so its reduct (\"r\" \"r\") → \"y\" is also true, and, by modus ponens, so is \"y\". As \"y\" can be any statement, any statement may be proved true.\n\nThus (\"r\" \"r\") is a non-terminating computation. Considered as logic, (\"r\" \"r\") is an expression for a value that does not exist.\n\nIn simply typed lambda calculus, such terms, like any fixed-point combinators, cannot be typed and hence are not admitted.\n\nCurry's paradox may also be expressed in combinatory logic, which has equivalent expressive power to lambda calculus. Any lambda expression may be translated into combinatory logic, so a translation of the implementation of Curry's paradox in lambda calculus would suffice.\n\nIf \"m\" is the implication function taking two parameters (that is m A B is equivalent to A → B), then r in combinatory logic is\nthen\n\nThe paradox may also be produced using the Curry's paradoxical combinator, where\nThen\nis the solution of\nso \n\nCurry's paradox can be formulated in any language supporting basic logic operations that also allows a self-recursive function to be constructed as an expression. Two mechanisms that support the construction of the paradox are self-reference (the ability to refer to \"this sentence\" from within a sentence) and Unrestricted comprehension in naive set theory. Natural languages nearly always contain many of features that could be used to construct the paradox, as do many other languages. Usually the addition of meta programming capabilities to a language will add the features needed. Mathematical logic generally does not countenance explicit reference to its own sentences. However the heart of Gödel's incompleteness theorems is the observation that a different form of self-reference can be added; see Gödel number.\n\nThe axiom of Unrestricted comprehension adds the ability to construct a recursive definition in set theory. This axiom is not supported by modern set theory.\n\nThe logic rules used in the construction of the proof are rule of assumption for conditional proof, the rule of contraction, and modus ponens. These are included in the most common logical systems, such as first-order logic.\n\nIn the 1930s, Curry's Paradox and the related Kleene–Rosser paradox played a major role in showing that formal logic systems based on self-recursive expressions are inconsistent.\nThese include some versions of lambda calculus and combinatory logic.\n\nCurry began with the Kleene–Rosser paradox and deduced that the core problem could be expressed in this simpler Curry's paradox. His conclusion may be stated as saying that combinatory logic and lambda calculus cannot be made consistent as deductive languages, while still allowing recursion.\n\nIn the study of illative (deductive) combinatory logic, Curry in 1941 recognized the implication of the paradox as implying that, without restrictions, the following properties of a combinatory logic are incompatible:\n\n\nNote that unlike the liar paradox or Russell's paradox, Curry's paradox does not depend on what model of negation is used, as it is completely negation-free. Thus paraconsistent logics can still be vulnerable to this paradox, even if they are immune to the liar paradox.\n\nThe origin of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus may have been, \"How can you solve an equation, to provide a definition of a function?\". This is expressed in this equivalence,\n\nThis definition is valid if there is one and only one function formula_18 that satisfies the equation formula_19, but invalid otherwise. This is the core of the problem that Stephen Cole Kleene and then Haskell Curry discovered with combinatory logic and Lambda calculus.\n\nThe situation may be compared to defining\n\nThis definition is fine as long as only positive values are allowed for the square root. In mathematics an existentially quantified variable may represent multiple values, but only one at a time. Existential quantification is the disjunction of many instances of an equation. In each equation is one value for the variable.\n\nHowever, in mathematics, an expression with no free variables must have one and only one value. So formula_21 can only represent formula_22. However there is no convenient way to restrict the lambda abstraction to one value or to assure that there is a value.\n\nLambda calculus allows recursion by passing the same function that is called as a parameter. This allows situations where formula_19 has multiple or no solutions for formula_18.\n\nLambda calculus may be considered as part of mathematics if only lambda abstractions that represent a single solution to an equation are allowed. Other lambda abstractions are incorrect in mathematics.\n\nCurry's paradox and other paradoxes arise in Lambda calculus because of the inconsistency of Lambda calculus considered as a deductive system. See also deductive lambda calculus.\n\nLambda calculus is a consistent theory in its own domain. However, it is not consistent to add the lambda abstraction definition to general mathematics. Lambda terms describe values from the lambda calculus domain. Each lambda term has a value in that domain.\n\nWhen translating expressions from mathematics to lambda calculus, the domain of lambda calculus terms is not always isomorphic to the domain of the mathematical expressions. This lack of isomorphism is the source of the apparent contradictions.\n\nThere are many language constructs that implicitly invoke an equation that may have none or many solutions. The sound resolution to this problem is to syntactically link these expressions to an existentially quantified variable. The variable represents the multiple values in a way that is meaningful in common human reasoning, but is also valid in mathematics.\n\nFor example, a natural language that allows the \"Eval\" function is not mathematically consistent. But each call to \"Eval\" in that natural language may be translated into mathematics in a way that is consistent. The translation of \"Eval(s)\" into mathematics is\n\nSo where s = \"Eval(s) → y\",\n\nIf y is false, then the x = x → y is false, but this is a falsehood, not a paradox.\n\nThe existence of the variable x was implicit in the natural language. The variable x is created when the natural language is translated into mathematics. This allows us to use natural language, with natural semantics, while maintaining mathematical integrity.\n\nThe argument in formal logic starts with assuming the validity of naming (X → Y) as X. However, this is not a valid starting point. First we must deduce the validity of the naming. The following theorem is easily proved and represents such a naming:\n\nIn the above statement the formula A is named as X. Now attempt to instantiate the formula with (X → Y) for A. However, this is not possible, as the scope of formula_26 is inside the scope of formula_27. The order of the quantifiers may be reversed using Skolemization:\n\nHowever, now instantiation gives\n\nwhich is not the starting point for the proof and does not lead to a contradiction. There are no other instantiations for A that lead to the starting point of the paradox.\n\nIn Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory the axiom of unrestricted comprehension is replaced with a group of axioms that allow construction of sets. So Curry's paradox cannot be stated in ZFC. ZFC evolved in response to Russell's paradox.\n\n\n"}

When rules of expected behaviour are broken, punishment is often used as a means of disciplining.\n\nIn BDSM, rules can be made so that a submissive (\"sub\") knows how they should behave (so that the dominant is not displeased). Rules can also be for reminding subs of their inferior status, or for training a novice sub. When such rules are broken, punishment is often used as a means of discipline. Punishment itself can be physical (such as caning) or psychological (such as public humiliation) or a combination of both (i.e., through bondage). \n\nThe goal of discipline is to teach the sub that they have made a mistake, so that they learn self-restraint and become a better sub in the future. The punishment is generally related to the mistake, and is generally proportionate to the severity and frequency of the mistake. For example, a punishment for speaking out of turn for the first time may be a simple restraint (such as being silenced using a gag). The sub may also be given the option of choosing a punishment (i.e., to be either caned on the buttocks or slapped on the face).\n\nPunishments done on BDSM submissives, even very harsh ones, should not be confused with sadomasochism. S&M involves giving pain/torture to a \"sub\" for the enjoyment of \"sub\" and/or \"dom\". Contrarily, punishments for disciplining are in response to violations of predetermined rules by a sub, or for otherwise displeasing the dominant. Punishment is considered a necessary evil in BDSM, as without it, a sub may repeat mistakes and thus not improve as a sub. 'BDSM punishment' is also not 'forced abuse' – in the former a sub must have granted the trainer prior authority to punish. Punishment should also not be confused with BDSM training which may involve giving pain just for increasing the endurance limit of the sub.\n\nSometimes, disciplining may avoid punishment altogether, and just a hard glance or loud voice from the dominant may be effective. \n\nContrary to punishments, disciplining may also involve positive reinforcement. This includes rewarding the slave for good behaviour (such as by calling the sub \"loyal slave\" or allowing them to sleep on bed).\n\n"}

Felix Flying Hawk's eldest son, David Flying Hawk, traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk as a performer with Wild West Shows.\n\nFelix Flying Hawk accompanied Chief Flying Hawk on his travels throughout the United States with Buffalo Bill and his Wild West. Felix was an excellent photographer and his most circulated photograph is of the legendary Oglala Lakota Chief Red Cloud taken in 1905.\n\"The Story of Felix Flying Hawk: Rustler Victim\" was published by Major Israel McCreight in 1943. Felix owned a small ranch in Manderson-White Horse Creek, South Dakota, and was arrested for stealing his own horses in the early 1900s. The story is about a special encounter with Major Israel McCreight attesting to the honesty and integrity of the Native American. McCreight described his conversation about Felix Flying Hawk with the famous American writer, publisher, artist, and philosopher Elbert Hubbard:\n\nElbert Hubbard and the writer sat at the small table in The Pennsylvania Society rehearsing mutual old time experiences in the west, particularly, tales relating, and had himself been adopted into the tribe, but recently. Memory may be slightly at fault, but as now recalled, there were a couple of champagne glasses, partly full, on the same table. The letter from Felix, apologizing for the delay of repaying a $30 loan and explaining how he had made a trip to Rapid and found the letter which had lain in the post office for months, how he had corrected the address, got it on its way to discharge his obligation, this letter had just come in the afternoon mail; the writer drew it from his pocket and handed it to Hubbard to read. When he had completed the reading, and asked a few pertinent questions about the author, he folded it and deliberately placed it in his own pocket, saying it would be the subject of a new A Message to Garcia which he was going to write. Before he had accomplished this planned project for the thrill and edification of his world-wide fraternity of readers, the RMS Lusitania took America's greatest modern writer and philosopher to the bottom of the sea on May 17, 1915.\n\nDavid Flying Hawk was the eldest son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a performer with Wild West Shows and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named \"King Tut.\" \"King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at Tribune, Kansas. The real King Tut’s tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying quite a bit of news about it, therefore the name King Tut. The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse. A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924. This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders. Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil. The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in. King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first. There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works. While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back. When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild. They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on. That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo. We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year. I heard a few years ago that they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I’m sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board.\" \n\nOn March 25, 1927, Chief Flying Hawk wrote Major Israel McCreight for assistance, reporting that David had been arrested and jailed for horse stealing. McCreight well recalled the story of David’s father, Felix Flying Hawk, jailed in the early 1900s for stealing his own horses, and the injustice visited upon Native Americans. However, despite McCreight’s considerable efforts, David spent almost a year in county jails. The impact on David’s family was catastrophic, and without his help, Felix’s farm failed. Felix wrote McCreight. \"And they make spoil my family no farm on this year, because my son David was in jail and nobody can not help to work on our farm, and also David's sister, age 20 years, she was dead on May 15, 1927, for I am sorry everythings.\" McCreight reported that, \"My investigation shows that he was charged with stealing ponies, two having come into his possession in a trade in which he sold to some horse buyers without having changed the brands. It is only one more of the many examples of persecution of the poor red man by the grafting, cowardly, agency officials. There seems little or no legal remedy for it.\" David Flying Hawk later became Treaty Chairman of the South Dakota and Seven Camp Fires, pursuing the United States Government for broken treaty obligations.\n\nFelix Flying Hawk wrote letters on behalf of his father Chief Flying Hawk and corresponded with McCreight from 1912 until 1944. The letters are a part of the \"Major Israel McCreight Archives\" at the Du Bois Area Historical Society\n"}

{"id": "2324104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2324104", "title": "Formalism (literature)", "text": "Formalism (literature)\n\nFormalism is a school of literary criticism and literary theory having mainly to do with structural purposes of a particular text. It is the study of a text without taking into account any outside influence. Formalism rejects or sometimes simply \"brackets\" (\"i.e.\", ignores for the purpose of analysis) notions of culture or societal influence, authorship, and content, and instead focuses on modes, genres, discourse, and forms.\n\nIn literary theory, formalism refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret, or evaluate the inherent features of a text. These features include not only grammar and syntax but also literary devices such as meter and tropes. The formalistic approach reduces the importance of a text’s historical, biographical, and cultural context.\n\nFormalism rose to prominence in the early twentieth century as a reaction against Romanticist theories of literature, which centered on the artist and individual creative genius, and instead placed the text itself back into the spotlight to show how the text was indebted to forms and other works that had preceded it. Two schools of formalist literary criticism developed, Russian formalism, and soon after Anglo-American New Criticism. Formalism was the dominant mode of academic literary study in the US at least from the end of the Second World War through the 1970s, especially as embodied in René Wellek and Austin Warren's \"Theory of Literature\" (1948, 1955, 1962).\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, formalism was substantially displaced by various approaches (often with political aims or assumptions) that were suspicious of the idea that a literary work could be separated from its origins or uses. The term has often had a pejorative cast and has been used by opponents to indicate either aridity or ideological deviance. Some recent trends in academic literary criticism suggest that formalism may be making a comeback.\n\nWilliam H Thelin criticizes Maxine Hairston’s approach to teaching composition from a current-traditional standpoint, which she then mixes with the political. He claims that “No matter how sound the politics … the student would have no choice but to regurgitate that dogma in the clearest terms possible and to shift concentration onto matters of structure and correctness”.\n\nMary Ann Cain writes that “formalism asserts that the text stands on its own as a complete entity, apart from the writer who produced it”. Moreover, Cain says that “one can regard textual products as teachable and still maintain that being a writer is a \"natural\" act, one not subject to instruction. Composition, like creative writing, has flourished under the assumption that students are already writers, or have the capacity to learn-and that everyone should be writers. Yet the questions composition tends to pose within this assumption are not so much about which aspects of writing can or cannot be taught, but how writing can be taught and under what conditions.\nIn regards to formalist composition, one must ask, “to what extent is this ‘need’ for ‘academic discourse’ real – any more than the need for more ‘imaginative writing’ is real-except to perform some function, to get something done?”.\n\nFormalism research involves studying the ways in which students present their writing. Some ways formalism research is conducted involves allowing the text to speak to the readers versus cutting out unintended meaning in a written piece. Respectively, these two methods deal with language as the “master” writer versus a teacher as the “master” writer.\n\nRussian Formalism refers to the work of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language (OPOYAZ) founded in 1916 in St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) by Boris Eichenbaum, Viktor Shklovsky and Yury Tynyanov, and secondarily to the Moscow Linguistic Circle founded in 1914 by Roman Jakobson. (The folklorist Vladimir Propp is also often associated with the movement.) Eichenbaum's 1926 essay \"The Theory of the 'Formal Method'\" (translated in Lemon and Reis) provides an economical overview of the approach the Formalists advocated, which included the following basic ideas:\n\nAccording to Eichenbaum, Shklovsky was the lead critic of the group, and Shklovsky contributed two of their most well-known concepts: defamiliarization (\"ostraneniye,\" more literally, 'estrangement') and the plot/story distinction (\"syuzhet/fabula\"). \"Defamiliarization\" is one of the crucial ways in which literary language distinguishes itself from ordinary, communicative language, and is a feature of how art in general works, namely by presenting the world in a strange and new way that allows us to see things differently. Innovation in literary history is, according to Shklovsky, partly a matter of finding new techniques of defamiliarization. The plot/story distinction separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the story) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the plot). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the significance of the form of a literary work in order to define its \"literariness.\" For the Russian Formalists as a whole, form is what makes something art to begin with, so in order to understand a work of art as a work of art (rather than as an ornamented communicative act) one must focus on its form.\n\nThis emphasis on form, seemingly at the expense of thematic content, was not well-received after the Russian Revolution of 1917. One of the most sophisticated critiques of the Formalist project was Leon Trotsky's \"Literature and Revolution\" (1924). Trotsky does not wholly dismiss the Formalist approach, but insists that \"the methods of formal analysis are necessary, but insufficient\" because they neglect the social world with which the human beings who write and read literature are bound up: \"The form of art is, to a certain and very large degree, independent, but the artist who creates this form, and the spectator who is enjoying it, are not empty machines, one for creating form and the other for appreciating it. They are living people, with a crystallized psychology representing a certain unity, even if not entirely harmonious. This psychology is the result of social conditions\" (180, 171). The Formalists were thus accused of being politically reactionary because of such unpatriotic remarks as Shklovsky's (quoted by Trotsky) that \"Art was always free of life, and its color never reflected the color of the flag which waved over the fortress of the City\"(source?)(164). The leaders of the movement suffered political persecution beginning in the 1920s, when Joseph Stalin came to power, which largely put an end to their inquiries. But their ideas continued to influence subsequent thinkers, partly due to Tzvetan Todorov's translations of their works in the 1960s and 1970s, including Todorov himself, Barthes, Genette and Jauss.\n\nThe Moscow Linguistic Circle founded by Jakobson was more directly concerned with recent developments in linguistics than Eichenbaum's group. Jakobson left Moscow for Prague in 1920 and in 1926 co-founded the Prague Linguistic Circle, which embodied similar interests, especially in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure.\n\n\n"}

A manuscript fragment may consist of whole or partial leaves, typically made of parchment, conjugate pairs or sometimes gatherings of a parchment book or codex, or parts of single-leaf documents such as notarial acts. They are commonly found in book bindings, especially printed books from the 15th to the 17th centuries, used in a variety of ways such as wrappers or covers for the book, as endpapers, or cut into pieces and used to reinforce the binding.\n\nIn recent years, fragmentology has become an active part of scholarly medieval studies fuelled by the abundance in institutional libraries of binding fragments that have never been studied or even catalogued. A number of symposia, websites and projects have been formed to pursue the study.\n\nLeaves and parts of parchment leaves have been used in bindings of manuscripts since the Middle Ages. The use of manuscript fragments in bindings increased greatly at the end of the 15th century when printed books began to appear in increasing numbers, supplanting many older manuscripts. The conversion of northern Europe to Protestantism and the closing of monasteries and convents resulted in the discarding of many Catholic religious and liturgical manuscripts some of which were used by bookbinders. Sometimes, manuscript fragments have been removed from bookbindings either because the fragments were viewed as significant or valuable, or in the course of rebinding. Removal of these fragments destroys important context and evidence and is strongly criticized by scholars. Where it is necessary to remove such fragments, accepted practice requires they be preserved with the book and their original location recorded.\n\nManuscript fragments may provide a variety of useful evidence for medievalists, bibliographers and paleographers, including:\n\n\nBeginning in the nineteenth century, collectors cut ornamented initial letters and miniatures from illuminated manuscripts. In the twentieth century some book dealers began removing leaves from manuscripts to be sold for greater profit as individual pages or keepsakes. This \"breaking\" of manuscripts has been most common with books of hours which contain illuminated pages, gilding and attractive decorations. \"As a result, today there are tens of thousands of single leaves in several hundred U.S. collections.\" This practice continues today and many individual leaves of books of hours and antiphonals are available on eBay and from book and manuscript dealers. Scholars strongly condemn this practice, even where the manuscript is incomplete to begin with, as it destroys the integrity and evidence of the entire manuscript. The most famous or infamous manuscript breaker was Otto Ege, who dismembered many complete and fragmentary manuscripts to sell the leaves individually or in large boxed collections.\n\nScholars have studied Otto Ege's dismemberment and sale of manuscript leaves and have attempted to locate the present locations of the leaves of some of those manuscripts. A number of online projects have been started to collect images of these and other manuscript leaves in a virtual reconstruction of the original manuscripts. This has been referred to as \"digital fragmentology.\" Websites have also been used to identify and date manuscript fragments through crowdsourcing.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36895524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36895524", "title": "Jad language", "text": "Jad language\n\nJad (Dzad), also known as \"Bhotia\" and \"Rongba\", is a language spoken by a community of about 300 in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, in India. It is spoken in several villages, and the three major villages are Jadhang, Nelang and Pulam Sumda in the Harsil sub-division of the Uttarkashi District. Jad is closely related to the Lahuli–Spiti language, which is another Tibetic language. Jad is spoken alongside Garhwali and Hindi. Code switching between Jad and Garhwali is very common. The language borrows some vocabulary from both Hindi and Garhwali. It is primarily a spoken language.\n\nThe name Bhotia means \"those from the north\", referring to the geographical location of the population who speaks the language. The name Bhotia encompasses a large set of languages and is used to refer to multiple groups, Jad is specifically spoken by the Bhotias of Nelang. The term Bhotia is unrelated to the language of the people of Bhutan, which is an independent Himalayan state in the northeastern area of the subcontinent. The name Jad is derived from the summer village name, where the Jad people spend the summer season, which is called Jadhang.\n\nScholarship on Jad and people has been very limited. The population has not been subjected to a thorough study or survey. Work has been scattered and of uncertain quality. As of 1977, there were two reasons for the lack of scholarship on the language and people. First, the Bhotias reside in places which are difficult to reach geographically. Secondly, security clearance must be obtained from the Home Department and Defense Department of India before scholars are allowed to visit the border where the Jad live. As a result, the amount of research that has been conducted is limited in volume and scope.\n\nThe following table describes the location in the mouth where vowels are pronounced in Jad.\nOnly the back u and o are rounded (see: roundedness) in context of lip positioning, all other vowels are unrounded. There are no diphthongs in Jad, but vowels frequently occur in sequence. There is no strong rule for which order the vowels must fall in when in a sequence, so many different orders are found in Jad.\n\nVowels tend to be nasalized when they follow a nasalized consonant, and glottalized when they are placed before a glottal stop. The pronunciation of the vowel is effected by the nearby consonant sounds.\n\nMost consonants can start a word, with the exception of \"ṇ\" and \"ṛ\". It is extremely rare for a consonant to end a word, with the exception of \"b\", \"d\", and \"g\". Voiced consonants are occasionally de-voiced, particularly when in the final position of a word or coming immediately before a voiceless sound. Unvoiced plositives tend to be voiced when coming after a voiced sound. Deaspiration also occurs. When an aspirated consonant is followed by a back vowel, the aspiration of the consonant is significantly reduced. Like vowels in Jad, pronunciation of consonant sounds shifts according to the sounds surrounding the consonants.\n\nConsonant clusters can be found in initial and middle sections of words. The first consonant must be a plosive, a fricative, or a liquid consonant. The second consonant must be a semi-vowel or a liquid consonant.\n\nWords may be monomorphemic or polymorphemic. Words follow the following rule set:\n\n\nWord composition is also limited by a set of permissible syllables. Permitted syllables are /V/, /VC/, /CV/, /CCV/, /CVC/, /CCVC/, and /CVCC/. These syllables can be combined to make up longer words.\n\nIn Jad, nouns act as subjects or objects of verbs. Nouns are subject to number, gender, and cases. Inanimate nouns are genderless and also are not changed for plural number. Animate nouns and human nouns have distinct mechanisms for marking gender. Pluralization is marked for human beings only. New nouns can be formed by adding new stems, reduplicating stems, or adding suffixes.\n\nGender is denoted in two ways. Prefixes can be added to indicate gender of living creatures, or distinct words are used for female and male counterparts. Plurals are marked on animate nouns by adding plural suffixes. Plurals can be noted on inanimate nouns by using a descriptor word to provide details about the noun, but cannot themselves be changed to represent pluralization.\n\nDifference cases of nouns are used to describe a variety of functions. These include possession, subject, object, means, purpose, advantage, separation, origin, material composition, time, place, etc.\n\nJad follows a structure of noun-adjective. An example is the phrase \"a very black dog.\" In Jad, this phrase is \"khi nagpo məŋpo cig\", or \"dog black very one.\" This illustrates the noun-adjective word order. It also places adjectives before degree descriptors, following an adjective-degree syntactic form. For example, the phrase \"very black\" in Jad would be \"nagpo məŋpo\" where \"nagpo\" translates as black and \"məŋpo\" translates to very.\n\nIt is primarily a spoken language. All written communication is in Hindi. Attitudes toward Jad are negative with little institutional support. Education, media, television, and all other official sources of communication are in Hindi. There is no known literature, with the exception of a one page translation of a story about a prodigal son. It is vigorously endangered and under severe threat, and it is unclear if the current state of bilingualism and code switching will continue or if Jad will be entirely replaced by either Hindi or Garhwali.\n\n"}

It is a creole language based on Kikongo, a family of closely related Bantu languages. It is an official language in Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nIt is not entirely accurate to call Kituba a creole language as it lacks the distinction between superstrate and substrate influence that is typical of creole development.\n\nKituba is known by many names among its speakers. In the Republic of Congo it is called \"Munukutuba\" or \"Kituba\". The former is a grammatically incorrect phrase which means literally \"I to speak\". The latter means simply \"speech\". The name \"Kituba\" is used in the constitution of the Republic of Congo.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo it is called \"Kikongo ya leta\" (i.e. Kikongo of the state administration), but it is often called in short \"Kikongo\", especially out of the region of ethnic Bakongo people. The constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo lists Kikongo as one of the national languages. In fact, it refers to Kikongo ya leta (i.e. Kituba), because a translation of the constitution itself is written in Kituba but no translation exists in Kikongo.\n\nThere are also other historical names such as \"Kibulamatadi\", \"Kikwango\", \"Ikeleve\" (literally: \"He is not here\"), and \"Kizabave\" but they have largely fallen out of use. In the academic circles the language is called \"Kikongo-Kituba\".\n\nThe majority of Kituba speakers live in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is spoken as the primary lingua franca in the provinces of Bas-Congo, Kwango and Kwilu and to a lesser extent in Kinshasa, Mai-Ndombe and Kasai-Occidental.\n\nKituba is the largest language of the Republic of Congo. It is spoken in the southern half of the country, in regions of Kouilou (especially in Pointe-Noire), Niari, Bouenza, Lékoumou, Pool and in the capital Brazzaville. Lingala is more popular in the north.\n\nThe status of Kituba in Angola is not known. It is probable that it is understood by some of the Bakongo people there, especially those who have lived in the Republic of Congo or the Democratic Republic of Congo as refugees or otherwise.\n\nKituba is a national language in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In practice the term \"national language\" means that it is a language of regional administration and elementary education.\n\nA national language is also one that is used for public and mass communication. National public radios and televisions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the Republic of Congo use Kituba as one of their main languages for evening news.\n\nFirst Kituba developed downriver Congo, an area which is inhabited by the Bakongo.\n\nThere are several theories on how Kituba came into being. One theory claims that it had already evolved at the time of the Kongo Kingdom as a simplified interdialectal trade language, which the European colonists subsequently took into use for regional administration. Another theory claims that a simplified trade language called Kifyoti was developed at the Portuguese coastal trading 18\npost and it was later spread upstream by the Christian missionaries to the region between the Kwango and the Kasai rivers where it evolved further (hence the name Kikwango). Yet another theory emphasizes the construction of the Matadi-Kinshasa railroad at the end of the 19th century, which involved forced labour from West Africa, lower Congo, and the neighbouring Bandundu region. The workers had diverse linguistic backgrounds which gave birth to a grammatically simplified language.\n\nRegardless of the genesis, Kituba has established itself in the large towns that were found during the colonial period between 1885 and 1960. Kituba is spoken as the primary language in the large Bakongo cities of Moanda, Boma, Matadi, Pointe-Noire, Dolisie, Nkayi, and Brazzaville and also in large non-Bakongo cities of Bandundu, Kikwit, and Ilebo.\n\nA translation of the New Testament in Kituba was completed and published in 2005.\n\nKituba has five vowel phonemes: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. They are very similar to the vowels of Spanish and Italian. Vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress. The vowels are pronounced as follows:\n\nNotes:\n\nKituba has subject and object pronouns. The object pronouns are used in place of subject pronouns when the subject is being emphasized.\n\nKituba has kept by and large the noun classes of ethnic Kikongo with some modifications. The classes 9 and 11 have in effect merged with the singular class with zero prefix, and their plural is formed with generic plural class prefix \"ba-\".\n\nKituba has a well-developed verbal system involving grammatical tense and aspect. Most verb forms have long and short versions. The long forms are used in formal written communication whereas the short forms have developed for spoken communication.\n\nThe irregular conjugation of the verb \"kuvanda\" or \"kuvuanda\" (to be) is presented in the table below. It is the only irregular verb in Kituba.\n\nAll other verbs are conjugated with the help of auxiliary verbs. The conjugation of the verb \"kusala\" (to do) is presented in the table below.\n\nThe suffix indicating voice is adding after the verb root and before the suffix indicating tense.\n\nThe most common forms are \"ila\", indicating action to or toward someone, and \"ana\", indicating mutual or reciprocal action:\n\nKutanga \"to read\", Tangila \"read to\", Tangilaka \"read to\" (past)\n\nSadisa \"to help\", Sadisana \"help one another\", Sadisanaka \"helped one another (past)\n\nA Kituba-English-French dictionary compiled by linguist Harold W. Fehderau, Ph.D., was published in 1969. It is not widely available.\n\nThe bulk of Kituba words come from Kikongo. Other Bantu languages have influenced it as well, including Kiyaka, Kimbala, Kisongo, Kiyansi, Lingala, and Swahili. In addition, many words have been borrowed from French, Portuguese, and English.

{"id": "47833350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47833350", "title": "Litema", "text": "Litema\n\nLitema (pronounced: /ditʼɪːma/; also spelled \"Ditema\"; Singular: Tema, Sesotho for \"text\" or \"ploughed land\") is a form of Sesotho mural art composed of decorative and symbolic geometric patterns, commonly associated with Sesotho tradition today practised in Lesotho and neighbouring areas of South Africa. Basotho women generate litema on the outer walls and inside of homesteads by means of engraving, painting, relief mouldings and/or mosaic. Typically the geometric patterns are combed or scratched into the wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster of the wall, and later painted with earth ochers or, in contemporary times, manufactured paint. Patterns most often mimic ploughed fields through a combed texture, or the patterns refer to plant life, and more occasionally to other aspects of the natural world, such as referring to clan totem animal. Litema are transient; they may desiccate and crumble or be washed away by heavy rain. It is common for women of an entire village to apply litema on such special occasions as a wedding or a religious ceremony.\n\nAs Gary van Wyk (1993:84) pointed out in his analysis of the etymology of the Sesotho noun denoting \"Sesotho mural art,\" \"litema\" also refers to the associated concepts of \"ploughed lands\", and the decorative tradition is symbolically linked to cultivation in many ways. It is derived from the verb stem \"-lema\" (in the infinitive, \"ho lema\" \"to cultivate\"), which is a reflex of the Proto-Bantu root \"*-dɪ̀m-\" \"to cultivate (esp. with hoe)\". The orthographic <l> in \"li-\" (Class 10 noun class prefix for Sesotho nouns) is pronounced [d] in Sesotho since [d] is an allophone of /l/ occurring before the close vowels, /i/ and /u/. The orthographic <e> can have three possible values in Sesotho: /ɪ/, /ɛ/, and /e/. In <litema> is pronounced /ɪ/, as per the Proto-Bantu root.\n\nThe litema patterns are characterised by a multi-stage symmetry. Patterns are generally arranged in square cells. A wall to be shaped is divided into a grid to form the cells. Each cell is applied with the same pattern, which is usually rotated or mirrored from cell to cell. The symmetry of the overall pattern thus depends on the symmetries present in the basic pattern. There are designs with only one mirror axis in the basic patterns that result in an overall impression of flowing in one direction. Other basic patterns have several axes of symmetry or a rotational symmetry, and give the overall pattern a rather flat ornamental impression. The colour design is restrained, usually only two colours are used\n\nThe tradition of mural art in Southern Africa is not of recent origins. While excavations at Sotho-Tswana archaeological sites have revealed hut floors that have survived the elements for as much as 1500 years, the earliest evidence of Sotho-Tswana mural painting stretches back about five centuries (Grant 1995:45 ; Van Wyk 1998:88). It long predates the tradition of Ndebele mural painting that has been globaly popularized. Begun in the 19th century, the Ndzundza Ndebele mural art tradition called \"igwalo\" (more widely known as Ndebele house painting), is said to be a synthesis of a Northern Sotho \"ditema\" tradition and the Nguni design traditions employed in beadwork, pottery and basket weaving.\n\nOne of the earliest written accounts of Basotho mural art is by the missionary Rev. John Campbell. In his 1813 description of Batlhaping (South Tswana) art, Campbell stated the following:\"Having heard of some paintings in Salakootoo's house, we went after breakfast to view them. We found them very rough representations of the camel-leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, lion, tiger, and stein-buck, which Salakootoo's wife had drawn on the clay wall, with white and black paint. However, they were as well done as we expected, and may lead to something better\" (Grant 1995:43).\n\nOn his second journey in 1820, Campbell, gave an enthusiastic account of what he saw at the house of a certain chief \"Sinosee\" of the Hurutse lineage of the Sotho-Tswana. Campbell provided both illustrations as well as a verbal description of the chief's house: \"The wall was painted yellow, and ornamented with figures of shields, elephants and camel-leopards, etc. It was also adorned with a neat cornice or border painting of a red colour...its walls (of Sinosee's bedroom) were decorated with delightful representations of elephants and giraffes… In some houses there were figures, pillars, etc moulded in hard clay and painted with different colours that would not have disgraced European workmen\" (Van Wyk 1996:43; 1998:88).\n\nCampbell's accounts were compiled and published by historian George Stow, in his book \"The Native Races of South Africa\" (1905). Stow also published the earliest known drawings of litema – reproductions of eight designs made by the \"Bakuena\" (the founding clan of the Basotho nation), which he likely drew himself, based on an unpublished letter by Stow in the South African Library in which he recounts visiting a ruined Bakoena kraal (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's drawings showed textured panels similar to litema engravings still made today as well as painted patterns of dots, stripes, triangles, and zigzags executed in limited colors. \n\nIn his 1861 book, the French missionary Eugene Casallis recalled the litema patterns he had experienced since settling among Basotho in the 1830s, calling the designs \"ingenious\", which suggests designs more intricate than the Bakoena examples Stow reproduced (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's documentation did not include any designs incorporating plant motifs like those seen in modern-day litema. Van Wyk (1994) suggests that the more modern and \"intricate curvilinear designs have a distinctly Victorian or Edwardian flavor that was probably influenced by such turn-of-the-century European products as linoleum patterns, cast-iron moldings and lace\". \n\nAlmost a century separates Stow's drawings from those done in 1976 by students of the Lesotho National Teachers Training College (Van Wyk 1989:89). Benedict Lira Mothibe, an art lecturer at the college at the time, instructed students to copy litema designs for the purposes of using these in classroom geometry lessons and as copies for potato prints. More importantly, it was an attempt by Mothibe to revive interest in what he considered a worthwhile Sesotho tradition. Gary van Wyk employed these drawings during his extensive field research in South Africa and Lesotho from 1991-1994, recording women's responses to the historical patterns, including the names and meanings they ascribed to them, and later republished several of the drawings. He found that although many of the specific vegetal patterns (e.g. \"melons\") that had been named in the 1970s had been forgotten by the 1990s and subsumed under a general descriptive category of \"blomme\", the Afrikaans word for \"flowers,\" nonetheless this designation maintained the close symbolic association between women and vegetative fertility, linked to women's traditional roles as cultivators and foragers. Furthermore, a few patterns recorded by Mothibe were still identifiable and being produced in the early 1990s, such as one that refers to the board for marabaraba, a popular indigenous game like checkers (1998:90-91). \n\nMore recently (2003), Mothibe, in a further contribution towards the cause of preservation, compiled and donated a second edition on litema designs entitled \"Basotho Litema Patterns (With Modifications)\" to the School of Design Technology and Visual Art of the Central University of Technology, Free State, providing an updated record of designs and their interpretation.\n\nResearch conducted by Van Wyk and Mathews in the late-1980s and mid-1990s, culminating in two photographically illustrated books titled \"African Painted Houses: Basotho Dwellings of Southern Africa\" (Van Wyk, 1998) and \"The African Mural\" (Chanquion & Matthews, 1989)), suggests that the art of litema cannot be understood in purely aesthetic terms. \n\nIn several works on this topic, Gary Van Wyk (1993, 1994, 1996, 1998) states that Sesotho murals are a form of religious art, appeals to the ancestors for the rain that delivers the fertility that nourishes the fields and thereby sustains the herds and the human community. Murals, he says, can be seen as prayers in paint. If the ancestors are satisfied, they provide rain that washes away the murals, and the cycle of life begins anew. It is fitting that murals are produced by women, who are symbolically linked to the house, which is a metaphor of the womb and of creation, and to the vegetal realm to which women are linked through their traditional roles as cultivators and foragers, and through several other vegetal symbols. The Basotho creation myth, for example, states that the nation emerged from a dark place deep in the earth through a bed of reeds; accordingly it was once customary upon the birth of child inside the earthen house, originally built in an igloo shape, and therefore womb-like, to place a reed in the doorway of the home until the child \"crossed the reed\" to emerge into the light of day (Van Wyk 1998: 103-107). Similarly, female initiates wear a reed mask, and during their initiation confinement they weave reed mats. \n\nThis symbolic link between the igloo-shaped house and the body later was transferred to modern rectangular homes with flat roofs, where the surrounds of doorways and windows were particularly ornamented, and the name for the litema patterns along the roofline was the \"headband\". \n\n\"The fecundity of fields and of women is celebrated in the creation of radiant blooms, unfurling fronds, spiralling tendrils and sprouts...Because agricultural labor was traditionally women's work, women who decorate houses can be viewed as picturing this work in the fields upon their walls. The murals are thus African landscapes, composed of the very landscape they represent\"(Van Wyk 1994). This is most apparent in litema patterns that consist solely of uncolored combing into mud: these closely mimic the appearance of a plowed field. \n\nVan Wyk found that red ocher, called \"letsoku\", or \"the blood of the earth\", symbolized fertility and the blood of both menstruation and sacrifice, underscoring the key link between the ancestors and fertility and accounting for the fact that red ocher is invariably incorporated into every painting scheme. White symbolized the calm, purity and enlightenment that the ancestors promote and desire, while black represented the dark rain clouds that the ancestors deliver if all is calm and well, and these two colors are frequently combined in dense, alternating patterns applied to transitional zones of the architecture, such as the roofline and around doors and windows. Similarly, such patterns elements as triangles and zigzags likely also carried symbolic meanings that have become obscured in recent times. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Van Wyk also photographed murals that expressed political statements, using the colors of the banned African National Congress during the apartheid era, or incorporating specific political graphics or statements. \nTom Mathews in his writings (supported by photographs taken by his son Paul Chanquion) stated that flowers and dots were symbols of fertility. Furthermore, he states that chevron patterns represent water or uneven ground whilst triangles are symbols denoting male and female (Changuion & Matthews, 1989:9,19,55).\n\nIn the study conducted by the CUT, no persons knowledgeable in the art of litema (Bekker, Thabane and Mothibe) or practising litema artists had any knowledge of a deeper significance other than that of beautifying the home for aesthetic purposes. Some of the artists questioned did however share their opinions concerning the possibility of symbolic meaning. According to artists in the Free State, their mothers (many of whom originate from Lesotho), might have been aware of such meanings, but did not share this information with them during their teaching.\n\nOne popular commentator has claimed that litema represent an ancient Basotho logographic writing system. As stated above, it is probable that there has always been a symbolic logic associated with litema (perhaps comparable to the tradition of Adinkra symbols in West Africa), but there is little evidence to assert the historical existence of a formal logography of the kind represented in Egyptian hieroglyphics or Chinese characters.\n\nNevertheless, there is indeed a contemporary writing system (specifically, a featural syllabary) associated with litema, that can be used to write Sesotho (and all other Southern Bantu languages). It is called \"Ditema tsa Dinoko\" (\"Ditema syllabary\") and is also known by its Zulu name, \"Isibheqe Sohlamvu\", and various other related names in different languages.\n\n\n\n"}

The law firms described by most commentators as comprising the Magic Circle are Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Linklaters and Slaughter and May.\n\nThe term Magic Circle was coined by \"The Lawyer\" magazine.\n\nThe magic circle is a \"journalistic device, coined by legal reporters in the wake of the break-up of its predecessor, the ‘club of nine'.\".\n\nThe \"club of nine\" was an informal group of law firms that comprised Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Herbert Smith, Linklaters, Lovells, Norton Rose, Slaughter and May and Stephenson Harwood. The members of the \"club of nine\" had an informal \"no-poaching\" agreement and the firm's senior partners would meet. \n\nIn 1996, Stephenson Harwood was asked to leave the ‘club of nine’ due to its stagnant performance. The \"club of nine\" was disbanded in 2000.\n\nThe magic circle, contrary to the \"club of nine\", isn't an informal grouping of law firms. Initially, the magic circle's membership was described by commentators as comprising the UK firms with strong corporate practices or international work. At the time, these firms were Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Linklaters, and Slaughter and May. Generally, the Magic Circle firms have among the highest earnings per-partner and earnings per-lawyer of UK-headquartered law firms.\n\nAt the time that the term was coined, Herbert Smith's corporate practice was focused on privatisation work, which had dried up. Arguably, for this reason, it was not included in the initial magic circle.\n\nIn 2004, Slaughter and May's then senior partner, Tim Clark, said: \"It's a funny concept. I don't know where the term came from or who founded it. It's mainly something that comes up when we talk to journalists or they talk to us. We don't describe ourselves as a magic circle firm in any of our marketing material.\" Linklaters' then head of corporate, David Cheyne, said: \"City law firms years ago used to provide information to each other so they could keep in touch with what was going on, but that ended yonks ago... It seems to be a term to describe the leading City firms and there is some truth in it.\" Then corporate partner at Herbert Smith Freehills and former investment banker Henry Raine said: \"The phrase was coined by a legal magazine and referred to firms which were very strong in corporate or international work. At the time, Herbert Smith was languishing in the corporate stakes, and so was consigned to the outer darkness.\" Since then, Herbert Smith Freehills has also, on occasion (although not widespread), been referred to as forming part of the magic circle. \n\nIn 2013, \"The Lawyer\" argued that Clifford Chance and Slaughter & May should no longer form part of the Magic Circle. It argued that Clifford Chance’s profitability does not match the other Magic Circle firms, and Slaughter & May operates a different (UK-focused) model and its revenue is less than half of the other Magic Circle firms.\n\nWhen \"The Lawyer\" magazine coined the term, it included Slaughter and May as part of the Magic Circle. \"The Lawyer\" magazine, however, no longer considers it to form part of the Magic Circle due to its lower revenues and UK domestic focus. In 2017, \"The Lawyer\" magazine stated that \"Slaughters fits the silver circle bill in every respect. London-centric, sky-high PEP, top-tier work, an aura of prestige: Slaughter and May is far more like Macfarlanes than the magic circle quartet it is commonly lumped in with. To put it in the same category as Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Linklaters would be inaccurate, and to say it is in a class of its own is frankly showing the firm too much deference.\" Most other commentators still consider Slaughter and May to be a member of the Magic Circle.\n\nThe Silver Circle is an informal term for perceived elite corporate law firms headquartered in the United Kingdom that are the main competitors for the magic circle in the United Kingdom. The term was coined by \"The Lawyer\" magazine in 2005 in response to the pre-existing term, Magic Circle. These firms have a lower turnover than the members of the Magic Circle, but consistently have an average profits per equity partner (PEP) and average revenue per lawyer (RPL) far above the UK average (and, in some instances, higher than members of the magic circle). Contrary to what the term Silver Circle may suggest, there is no Golden Circle.\n\nUK law firms, including Magic Circle law firms, have experienced increased competition from US law firms both domestically (from US law firms with a UK presence) and internationally.\n\nIn 2013, \"The Lawyer\" argued that the term Magic Circle would lose its relevance, becoming \"outmoded\": \"It will remain an easy shorthand to denote the UK-heritage firms with the biggest revenues, the most international work and which consistently outperform the rest of the [UK] market on profitability.\" It was argued that by 2023 global law firms will rather be split between the Global Elite law firms, International Business law firms and Super Boutique law firms. \n\nThe Global Elite law firms comprise Allen & Overy, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, Davis Polk & Wardwell, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Latham & Watkins, Linklaters, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Sullivan & Cromwell, Kirkland & Ellis and Weil, Gotshal & Manges.\n\nThe International Business law firms comprise Clifford Chance, Ashurst, Norton Rose Fulbright, Hogan Lovells, DLA Piper, Jones Day, Baker & McKenzie, White & Case, Herbert Smith Freehills, King & Wood Mallesons and Sidley Austin.\n\nThe Super Boutique law firms comprise Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Slaughter and May, Debevoise & Plimpton and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.\n\nIn 2014, it was reported that Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer wished to discard its Magic Circle designation in the US in favour of being part of the Global Elite. Similarly, in 2014, Linklaters’ then managing partner, Simon Davies, said \"The magic circle isn’t what it used to be in the context of the US market or any market. I don’t think it’s going to gain power or momentum and I don’t think it’s a strengthening brand in itself.\" and \"At the end of the day we see ourselves as one of the leading global law firms, not one of the leading magic circle firms\".\n\nThe following barristers' chambers in the United Kingdom are occasionally, by analogy, described by commentators as the Bar's Magic Circle:\n\n\nIn August 2018, research from The Lawyer, however, showed that South Square Chambers received more instructions from the Magic Circle law firms than any other chamber. Barristers from it worked on 64 matters for the Magic Circle law firms since 2015.\n\n\n"}

It can also be referred to as entity resolution.\n\nFor example, in the text mining field, software frequently needs to interpret the following text:\n\nJohn gave Edward the book. He then stood up and called to John to come back into the room.\n\nIn these sentences, the software must determine whether the pronoun \"he\" refers to \"John\", or \"Edward\" from the first sentence. The software must also determine whether the \"John\" referred to in the second sentence is the same as the \"John\" in the first sentence, or a third person whose name also happens to be \"John\". Such examples apply to almost all languages, and not only English.\n\nFrequently, this type of name resolution is also used across documents, for example to determine whether the \"George Bush\" referenced in an old newspaper article as President of the United States (George H. W. Bush) is the same person as the \"George Bush\" mentioned in a separate news article years later about a man who is running for President (George W. Bush.) Because many people may have the same name, analysts and software must take into account substantially more information than only a name to determine whether two identical references (\"George Bush\") actually refer to the same specific entity or person.\n\nName/entity resolution in text extraction and semantics is a notoriously difficult problem, in part because in many cases there is not sufficient information to make an accurate determination. Numerous partial solutions exist that rely on specific contextual clues found in the data, but there is no currently known general solution.\n\nThe problem is sometimes referred to as name disambiguation and, for digital libraries, author disambiguation.\n\nFor examples of software that might provide name resolution benefits, see also:\n\n"}

{"id": "234249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234249", "title": "Persius", "text": "Persius\n\nPersius, in full Aulus Persius Flaccus (; 4 December 34, in Volterra24 November 62), was a Roman poet and satirist of Etruscan origin. In his works, poems and satires, he shows a stoic wisdom and a strong criticism for what he considered to be the stylistic abuses of his poetic contemporaries. His works, which became very popular in the Middle Ages, were published after his death by his friend and mentor, the stoic philosopher Lucius Annaeus Cornutus.\n\nAccording to the \"Life\" contained in the manuscripts, Persius was born into an equestrian family at Volterra (Volaterrae, in Latin), a small Etruscan city in the province of Pisa, of good stock on both parents' side. When six years old he lost his father; his stepfather died a few years later. At the age of twelve Persius came to Rome, where he was taught by Remmius Palaemon and the rhetor Verginius Flavus. During the next four years he developed friendships with the Stoic Lucius Annaeus Cornutus, the lyric poet Caesius Bassus, and the poet Lucan. Lucan would become a generous admirer of all Persius wrote. He also became close friends with Thrasea Paetus, the husband of Arria, a relative of Persius's; over the next ten years Persius and Thrasea Paetus shared many travels together. Later, he met Seneca, but was not impressed by his genius.\n\nIn his boyhood, Persius wrote a tragedy dealing with an episode in Roman history, and another work, probably on travel (although this would have been before the travels with Thrasea Paetus). Reading the satires of Lucilius made Persius want to write like him, and he set to work on a book of his own satires. But he wrote seldom and slowly; a premature death (\"uitio stomachi\") prevented him from completing the book. He has been described as having \"a gentle disposition, girlish modesty and personal beauty\", and is said to have lived a life of exemplary devotion towards his mother Fulvia Sisenna, his sister and his aunt. To his mother and sister he left his considerable fortune. Cornutus suppressed all his work except the satires, to which he made some slight alterations before handing it over to Bassus for editing. It proved an immediate success.\n\nThe \"scholia\" add a few details—on what authority is, as generally with such sources, very doubtful. The \"Life\" itself, though not free from the suspicion of interpolation and undoubtedly corrupt and disordered in places, is probably trustworthy. The manuscripts say it came from the commentary of Valerius Probus, no doubt a learned edition of Persius like those of Virgil and Horace by this same famous \"grammarian\" of Berytus, the poet's contemporary. The only case in which it seems to conflict with the \"Satires\" () themselves is in its statement as to the death of Persius's father. The declaiming of a \"suasoria\" in his presence (Sat. 3.4 sqq.) implies a more mature age than that of six in the performer. But \"pater\" might here mean \"stepfather,\" or Persius may have forgotten his own autobiography, may be simply reproducing one of his models. The mere fact that the \"Life\" and the \"Satires\" agree so closely does not of course prove the authenticity of the former. One of the points of harmony is, however, too subtle for us to believe that a forger evolved it from the works of Persius: the \"Life\" gives the impression of a \"bookish\" youth, who never strayed far from home and family. This is also the picture drawn by the \"Satires\"; many of the characters that Persius creates have the same names as characters found in Horace.\n\nA keen observer of what occurs within his narrow horizon, Persius did not shy away from describing the seamy side of life (cf. e.g. such hints as \"Sat.\" iii.110), especially the relationship between excesses of consumption and moral failure; he shows little of Horace's easy-going acceptance of human weaknesses. Perhaps the sensitive, homebred nature of Persius can also be glimpsed in his frequent references to ridicule, whether of great men by street gamins or of the cultured by philistines. Montaigne mentions Persius several times.\n\nThe chief interest of Persius's work lies in its relation to Roman satire, in its interpretation of Roman Stoicism, and in its use of the Latin tongue. The influence of Horace on Persius can, in spite of the silence of the \"Life,\" hardly have been less than that of Lucilius. Not only characters, as noted above, but whole phrases, thoughts and situations come direct from him. The resemblance only emphasizes the difference between the caricaturist of Stoicism and its preacher. Persius strikes the highest note that Roman satire reached; in earnestness and moral purpose he rises far superior to the political rancour or good-natured persiflage of his predecessors and the rhetorical indignation of Juvenal. From him we learn how that philosophy could work on minds that still preserved the depth and purity of the old Roman \"gravitas.\" Some of the parallel passages in the works of Persius and Seneca are very close, and cannot be explained by assuming the use of a common source. Like Seneca, Persius censures the style of the day, and imitates it. Indeed, in some of its worst failings, straining of expression, excess of detail, exaggeration, he outbids Seneca, whilst the obscurity, which makes his little book of not seven hundred lines so difficult to read and is in no way due to great depth of thought, compares poorly with the terse clearness of the \"Epistolae morales\". A curious contrast to this tendency is presented by his free use of \"popular\" words. As of Plato, so of Persius, we hear that he emulated Sophron; the authority is a late one (the Byzantine Lydus, \"De mag.\" I.41), but we can at least recognize in the scene that opens \"Sat.\" 3 kinship with such work as Theocritus' \"Adoniazusae\" and the \"Mimes\" of Herodas.\n\nPersius's satires are composed in hexameters, except for the scazons of the short prologue above referred to. The first satire censures the literary tastes of the day as a reflection of the decadence of the national morals. The theme of Seneca's 114th letter is similar. The description of the recitator and the literary twaddlers after dinner is vividly natural, but an interesting passage which cites specimens of smooth versification and the languishing style is greatly spoiled by the difficulty of appreciating the points involved and indeed of distributing the dialogue (a not uncommon crux in Persius). The remaining satires handle in order (2) the question as to what we may justly ask of the gods (cf. \"Second Alcibiades\"), (3) the importance of having a definite aim in life, (4) the necessity of self-knowledge for public men (cf. Plato's \"First Alcibiades\"), (5) the Stoic doctrine of liberty (introduced by generous allusions to Cornutus' teaching), and (6) the proper use of money.\n\nThe \"Life\" tells us that the \"Satires\" were not left complete; some lines were taken (presumably by Cornutus or Bassus) from the end of the work so that it might be \"quasi finitus.\" This perhaps means that a sentence in which Persius had left a line imperfect, or a paragraph which he had not completed, had to be omitted. The same authority says that Cornutus definitely blacked out an offensive allusion to the emperor's literary taste, and that we owe to him the reading of the manuscripts in Sat. i.121,—\"\"auriculas asini \"quis non\" (for \"Mida rex\" ) habet!\"\" Traces of lack of revision are, however, still visible; cf. e.g. v.176 (sudden transition from ambition to superstition) and vi.37 (where criticism of Greek \"doctores\" has nothing to do with the context). The parallels to passages of Horace and Seneca are recorded in the commentaries: in view of what the \"Life\" says about Lucan, the verbal resemblance of \"Sat.\" iii.3 to \"Phars.\" x.163 is interesting. Examples of bold language or metaphor: i.25, \"rupto iecore exierit caprificus,\" 60, \"linguae quantum sitiat canis\"; iii.42, \"intus palleat,\" 81, \"silentia rodunt\"; v.92, \"ueteres auiae de pulmone reuello.\" Passages like iii.87, 100 sqq. show elaboration carried beyond the rules of good taste. \"Popular\" words: \"baro\", \"cerdo\", \"ebullire\", \"glutto\", \"lallare\", \"mamma\", \"muttire\", \"obba\", \"palpo\", \"scloppus\". Fine lines, etc., in i.116 sqq., ii.6 sqq., 61 sqq., 73 sqq., iii.39 sqq.\n\nThe manuscripts of Persius fall into two groups, one represented by two of the best of them, the other by that of Petrus Pithoeus, so important for the text of Juvenal. Since the publication of J. Bieger's \"de Persii cod. pith. recte aestimando\" (Berlin, 1890) the tendency has been to prefer the tradition of the latter.\n\nThe first important editions were: (1) with explanatory notes: Isaac Casaubon (Paris, 1605, enlarged edition by Johann Friedrich Dübner, Leipzig, 1833); Otto Jahn (with the \"scholia\" and valuable \"prolegomena,\" Leipzig, 1843); John Conington (with translation; 3rd ed., Oxford, 1893), etc.; but there are several modern editions.\n\n\n\n"}

It is defined as \"the use of green plants and the associated microorganisms, along with proper soil amendments and agronomic techniques to either contain, remove or render toxic environmental contaminants harmless\".\n\nPhytoremediation is a cost-effective plant-based approach of remediation that takes advantage of the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissues. It refers to the natural ability of certain plants called hyperaccumulators to bioaccumulate, degrade, or render harmless contaminants in soils, water, or air. Toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants are the major targets for phytoremediation. Knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of phytoremediation began to emerge in recent years together with biological and engineering strategies designed to optimize and improve phytoremediation. In addition, several field trials confirmed the feasibility of using plants for environmental cleanup.\n\nPhytoremediation may be applied wherever the soil or static water environment has become polluted or is suffering ongoing chronic pollution. Examples where phytoremediation has been used successfully include the restoration of abandoned metal mine workings, and sites where polychlorinated biphenyls have been dumped during manufacture and mitigation of ongoing coal mine discharges reducing the impact of contaminants in soils, water, or air. Contaminants such as metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives, and crude oil and its derivatives, have been mitigated in phytoremediation projects worldwide. Many plants such as mustard plants, alpine pennycress, hemp, and pigweed have proven to be successful at hyperaccumulating contaminants at toxic waste sites.\n\nNot all plants are able to accumulate heavy metals or organics pollutants due to differences the physiology of the plant. Even cultivars within the same species have varying abilities to accumulate pollutants.\n\nOver the past 20 years, this technology has become increasingly popular and has been employed at sites with soils contaminated with lead, uranium, and arsenic. While it has the advantage that environmental concerns may be treated in situ, one major disadvantage of phytoremediation is that it requires a long-term commitment, as the process is dependent on a plant's ability to grow and thrive in an environment that is not ideal for normal plant growth.\n\n\nPhytoremediation of efficiency of metal by \"Ficus microcarpa\" was evaluated through a real scale experiment. The root biomass production of the species varied significantly from 3.68 to 5.43 g because of the spatial heterogeneity of different metals. According to the study it could take 4-93 years to purify excess Cd on the experimental site. Mercury was unable to be premeditated by \"F. microcarpa\". The species of plant was moved to unpolluted soil. When transplanted Cd and CU were transferred to the rhizosphere soil. Pb and Hg were not released.\n\nThe Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) has been monitoring fuel oil spills at the Kaltag School in Kaltag, Alaska, since 1991. The community has been working with ADEC to use a phytoremediation plan drafted by scientists at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The ADEC continues to keep the public informed of the progress on their website.\n\nA range of processes mediated by plants or algae are useful in treating environmental problems:\n\nPhytoextraction (or \"phytoaccumulation\" or \"phytosequestration\") uses plants or algae to remove contaminants from soil or water into harvestable plant biomass. The roots take up substances from the soil or water and concentrate it above ground in the plant biomass Organisms that can uptake extremely high amounts of contaminants from the soil are called hyperaccumulators. Phytoextraction can also be performed by plants (e.g.Populus and Salix) that take up lower levels of pollutants, but due to their high growth rate and biomass production, may remove a considerable amount of contaminants from the soil. Phytoextraction has been growing rapidly in popularity worldwide for the last twenty years or so. Typically, phytoextraction is used for heavy metals or other inorganics. At the time of disposal, contaminants are typically concentrated in the much smaller volume of the plant matter than in the initially contaminated soil or sediment. After harvest, a lower level of the contaminant will remain in the soil, so the growth/harvest cycle must usually be repeated through several crops to achieve a significant cleanup. After the process, the cleaned soil can support other vegetation. Mining of these extracted metals through phytomining, is also being experimented with as a way of recovering the material. Hyperaccumulators are plants that can naturally take up the contaminants in soil unassisted. In many cases these are metallophyte plants that can tolerate and incorporate high levels of toxic metals. Induced or assisted phytoextraction is a process where a conditioning fluid containing a chelator or another agent is added to soil to increase metal solubility or mobilization so that the plants can absorb them more easily. While this leads to increased metal uptake by plants, it can also lead to large amounts of available metals in the soil beyond what the plants are able to translocate, causing potential leaching into the subsoil or groundwater.\n\nExamples of plants that are known to accumulate the following contaminants:\n\nPhytostabilization reduces the mobility of substances in the environment, for example, by limiting the leaching of substances from the soil. It focuses on the long term stabilization and containment of the pollutant. The plant immobilizes the pollutants by binding them to soil particles making them less available for plant or human uptake. Unlike phytoextraction, phytostabilization focuses mainly on sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots but not in plant tissues. Pollutants become less bioavailable, resulting in reduced exposure. The plants can also excrete a substance that produces a chemical reaction, converting the heavy metal pollutant into a less toxic form. Stabilization results in reduced erosion, runoff, leaching, in addition to reducing the bioavailability of the contaminant. An example application of phytostabilization is using a vegetative cap to stabilize and contain mine tailings.\n\nPhytodegradation (also called phytotransformation) uses plants or microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants in the soil or within the body of the plant. The organic compounds are broken down by enzymes that the plant roots secrete and these molecules are then taken up by the plant and released through transpiration. This process works best with organic contaminants like herbicides, trichloroethylene, and methyl \"tert\"-butyl ether.\n\nPhytotransformation results in the chemical modification of environmental substances as a direct result of plant metabolism, often resulting in their inactivation, degradation (phytodegradation), or immobilization (phytostabilization). In the case of organic pollutants, such as pesticides, explosives, solvents, industrial chemicals, and other xenobiotic substances, certain plants, such as Cannas, render these substances non-toxic by their metabolism. In other cases, microorganisms living in association with plant roots may metabolize these substances in soil or water. These complex and recalcitrant compounds cannot be broken down to basic molecules (water, carbon-dioxide, etc.) by plant molecules, and, hence, the term \"phytotransformation\" represents a change in chemical structure without complete breakdown of the compound.\nThe term \"Green Liver\" is used to describe phytotransformation, as plants behave analogously to the human liver when dealing with these xenobiotic compounds (foreign compound/pollutant). After uptake of the xenobiotics, plant enzymes increase the polarity of the xenobiotics by adding functional groups such as hydroxyl groups (-OH).\n\nThis is known as Phase I metabolism, similar to the way that the human liver increases the polarity of drugs and foreign compounds (drug metabolism). Whereas in the human liver enzymes such as cytochrome P450s are responsible for the initial reactions, in plants enzymes such as peroxidases, phenoloxidases, esterases and nitroreductases carry out the same role.\n\nIn the second stage of phytotransformation, known as Phase II metabolism, plant biomolecules such as glucose and amino acids are added to the polarized xenobiotic to further increase the polarity (known as conjugation). This is again similar to the processes occurring in the human liver where glucuronidation (addition of glucose molecules by the UGT class of enzymes, e.g. UGT1A1) and glutathione addition reactions occur on reactive centres of the xenobiotic.\n\nPhase I and II reactions serve to increase the polarity and reduce the toxicity of the compounds, although many exceptions to the rule are seen. The increased polarity also allows for easy transport of the xenobiotic along aqueous channels.\n\nIn the final stage of phytotransformation (Phase III metabolism), a sequestration of the xenobiotic occurs within the plant. The xenobiotics polymerize in a lignin-like manner and develop a complex structure that is sequestered in the plant. This ensures that the xenobiotic is safely stored, and does not affect the functioning of the plant. However, preliminary studies have shown that these plants can be toxic to small animals (such as snails), and, hence, plants involved in phytotransformation may need to be maintained in a closed enclosure.\n\nHence, the plants reduce toxicity (with exceptions) and sequester the xenobiotics in phytotransformation. Trinitrotoluene phytotransformation has been extensively researched and a transformation pathway has been proposed.\n\nPhytostimulation (or rhizodegradation) is the enhancement of soil microbial activity for the degradation of organic contaminants, typically by organisms that associate with roots. This process occurs within the rhizosphere, which is the layer of soil that surrounds the roots. Plants release carbohydrates and acids that stimulate microorganism activity which results in the biodegradation of the organic contaminants. This means that the microorganisms are able to digest and break down the toxic substances into harmless form. Phytostimulation has been shown to be effective in degrading petroleum hydrocarbons, PCBs, and PAHs. Phytostimulation can also involve aquatic plants supporting active populations of microbial degraders, as in the stimulation of atrazine degradation by hornwort.\n\nPhytovolatilization is the removal of substances from soil or water with release into the air, sometimes as a result of phytotransformation to more volatile and/or less polluting substances. In this process, contaminants are taken up by the plant and through transpiration, evaporate into the atmosphere. This is the most studied form of phytovolatilization, where volatilization occurs at the stem and leaves of the plant, however indirect phytovolatilization occurs when contaminants are volatilized from the root zone. Selenium (Se) and Mercury (Hg) are often removed from soil through phytovolatilization. Poplar trees are one of the most successful plants for removing VOCs through this process due to its high transpiration rate.\n\nRhizofiltration is a process that filters water through a mass of roots to remove toxic substances or excess nutrients. The pollutants remain absorbed in or adsorbed to the roots. This process is often used to clean up contaminated groundwater through planting directly in the contaminated site or through removing the contaminated water and providing it to these plants in an off-site location. In either case though, typically plants are first grown in a greenhouse under precise conditions.\n\nBiological hydraulic containment occurs when some plants, like poplars, draw water upwards through the soil into the roots and out through the plant, which decreases the movement of soluble contaminants downwards, deeper into the site and into the groundwater.\n\nPhytodesalination uses halophytes (plants adapted to saline soil) to extract salt from the soil to improve its fertility\n\nBreeding programs and genetic engineering are powerful methods for enhancing natural phytoremediation capabilities, or for introducing new capabilities into plants. Genes for phytoremediation may originate from a micro-organism or may be transferred from one plant to another variety better adapted to the environmental conditions at the cleanup site. For example, genes encoding a nitroreductase from a bacterium were inserted into tobacco and showed faster removal of TNT and enhanced resistance to the toxic effects of TNT.\nResearchers have also discovered a mechanism in plants that allows them to grow even when the pollution concentration in the soil is lethal for non-treated plants. Some natural, biodegradable compounds, such as exogenous polyamines, allow the plants to tolerate concentrations of pollutants 500 times higher than untreated plants, and to absorb more pollutants.\n\nA plant is said to be a hyperaccumulator if it can concentrate the pollutants in a minimum percentage which varies according to the pollutant involved (for example: more than 1000 mg/kg of dry weight for nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium or lead; or more than 10,000 mg/kg for zinc or manganese). This capacity for accumulation is due to hypertolerance, or \"phytotolerance\": the result of adaptative evolution from the plants to hostile environments through many generations. A number of interactions may be affected by metal hyperaccumulation, including protection, interferences with neighbour plants of different species, mutualism (including mycorrhizae, pollen and seed dispersal), commensalism, and biofilm.\n\n\nAs plants are able to translocate and accumulate particular types of contaminants, plants can be used as biosensors of subsurface contamination, thereby allowing investigators to quickly delineate contaminant plumes. Chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene, have been observed in tree trunks at concentrations related to groundwater concentrations. To ease field implementation of phytoscreening, standard methods have been developed to extract a section of the tree trunk for later laboratory analysis, often by using an increment borer. Phytoscreening may lead to more optimized site investigations and reduce contaminated site cleanup costs.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "132989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=132989", "title": "Royal Proclamation of 1763", "text": "Royal Proclamation of 1763\n\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued October 7, 1763, by King George III following Great Britain's acquisition of French territory in North America after the end of the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War. It forbade all settlement west of a line drawn along the Appalachian Mountains, which was delineated as an Indian Reserve. \n\nThis proclamation rendered worthless all land grants given by the government to British subjects who fought for the Crown against France. People throughout the various colonies were filled with indignation at having been unjustly shut out of the vast western wilderness and away from its resources. This anger was a foreshadowing of the discontent that would later arise during the American Revolution. The Royal Proclamation continues to be of legal importance to First Nations in Canada. The 1763 proclamation line is similar to the Eastern Continental Divide's path running northwards from Georgia to the Pennsylvania–New York border and north-eastwards past the drainage divide on the St. Lawrence Divide from there northwards through New England.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris was the official conclusion to the Seven Years' War, of which the French and Indian War was the North American theater. Under this treaty, France ceded ownership of all of continental North America east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, and the rest of Canada to Britain. Spain received all French territory west of the Mississippi. Both Spain and Britain received some French islands in the Caribbean. France kept a few small islands used by fishermen, modern-day Haiti and the rich sugar island of Guadeloupe.\n\nBesides regulating colonial expansion, the Proclamation of 1763 dealt with the management of inherited French colonies from the French and Indian War. It established government for four areas: Quebec, West Florida, East Florida, and Grenada.\n\nSome Native American peoples—primarily in the Great Lakes region—had a long and close relationship with France, and were dismayed to find that they were now under British sovereignty. They missed the amicable relationship with the French, along with the gifts they bestowed upon them, neither of which they had with the British. Pontiac's Rebellion (1763–66), a war launched by a group of natives around the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, was an unsuccessful effort by the western tribes to push the British back. However tribes were able to take over a large number of the forts which commanded the waterways involved in trade within the region and export to Great Britain. The Proclamation of 1763 had been in the works before Pontiac's Rebellion, but the outbreak of the conflict hastened the process. British officials hoped the proclamation would reconcile American Indians to British rule and help to prevent future hostilities.\n\nAt the outset, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 defined the jurisdictional limits of the occupied territories of North America. Explaining parts of the Frontier expansion in North America, in Colonial America and especially Canada colony of New France, a diminutive new colony, the Province of Quebec was carved. The territory northeast of the St. John River on the Labrador coast was placed under the Newfoundland Colony. The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the Allegheny mountains became Indian territory, temporarily barred to settlement, to the great disappointment of the land speculators of Virginia and Pennsylvania, who had started the Seven Years' War to gain these territories.\n\nThe proclamation created a boundary line (often called the \"proclamation line\") between the British colonies on the Atlantic coast and American Indian lands (called the Indian Reserve) west of the Appalachian Mountains. The proclamation line was not intended to be a permanent boundary between the colonists and Aboriginal lands, but rather a temporary boundary which could be extended further west in an orderly, lawful manner. It was also not designed as an uncrossable boundary; people could cross the line, just not settle past it. Its contour was defined by the headwaters that formed the watershed along the Appalachians. All land with rivers that flowed into the Atlantic was designated for the colonial entities, while all the land with rivers that flowed into the Mississippi was reserved for the native Indian population. The proclamation outlawed the private purchase of Native American land, which had often created problems in the past. Instead, all future land purchases were to be made by Crown officials \"at some public Meeting or Assembly of the said Indians\". Furthermore, British colonials were forbidden to settle on native lands, and colonial officials were forbidden to grant ground or lands without royal approval. The proclamation gave the Crown a monopoly on all future land purchases from American Indians.\n\nBritish colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the British government had already assigned land grants to them. Many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line, some of which had been temporarily evacuated during Pontiac's War, and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled. For example, George Washington and his Virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary. Prominent American colonials joined with the land speculators in Britain to lobby the government to move the line further west.\n\nTheir demands were met, and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Native Americans. In 1768 the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and the Treaty of Hard Labour, followed in 1770 by the Treaty of Lochaber, opened much of what is now Kentucky and West Virginia to British settlement.<br>\nA new map was drawn up at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768, that moved the line (from the green line to the red line on the map) much further to the west, and gave the lands claimed by the colonists to the British side.\n\nThe Royal Proclamation continued to govern the cession of Indigenous land in British North America, especially Upper Canada and Rupert's Land. Upper Canada created a platform for treaty making based on the Royal Proclamation. After loyalists moved into land after Britain's defeat in the American Revolution, the first impetus was created out of necessity. The proclamation forms the basis of land claims of Indigenous peoples in Canada – First Nations, Inuit, and Métis. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 is thus mentioned in Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nAccording to historian Colin Calloway, \"[settler] scholars disagree on whether the proclamation recognized or undermined tribal sovereignty\". The proclamation established the important precedent that the indigenous population had certain rights to the lands they occupied.\n\nSome see the Royal Proclamation of 1763 as a \"fundamental document\" for First Nations land claims and self-government. It is \"the first legal recognition by the British Crown of Aboriginal rights\" and imposes a fiduciary duty of care on the Crown. The intent and promises made to the native in the Proclamation have been argued to be of a temporary nature, only meant to appease the Native peoples who were becoming increasingly resentful of \"settler encroachments on their lands\" and were capable of becoming a serious threat to British colonial settlement. Advice given by a merchant to the Board of Trade on August 30, 1764, expressed that\n\nThe Indians all know we cannot be a Match for them in the midst of an extensive woody Country...from whence I infer that if we are determined to possess Our Posts, Trade & ca securely, it cannot be done for a Century by any other means than that of purchasing the favour of the numerous Indian inhabitants.\n\nSome historians believe that \"the British were trying to convince Native people that there was nothing to fear from the colonists, while at the same time trying to increase political and economic power relative to First Nations and other European powers\". Others argue that the Royal Proclamation along with the subsequent Treaty of Niagara, provide for an argument that \"discredits the claims of the Crown to exercise sovereignty over First Nations\" and affirms Aboriginal \"powers of self-determination in, among other things, allocating lands\".\n\nThe influence of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on the coming of the American Revolution has been variously interpreted. Many historians argue that the proclamation ceased to be a major source of tension after 1768, since the aforementioned treaties opened up extensive lands for settlement. Others have argued that colonial resentment of the proclamation contributed to the growing divide between the colonies and the mother country. Some historians argue that even though the boundary was pushed west in subsequent treaties, the British government refused to permit new colonial settlements for fear of instigating a war with Native Americans, which angered colonial land speculators. Others argue that the Royal Proclamation imposed a fiduciary duty of care on the Crown. \n\nGeorge Washington was given of wild land in the Ohio region for his services in the French and Indian War. In 1770, Washington took the lead in securing the rights of him and his old soldiers in the French War, advancing money to pay expenses in behalf of the common cause and using his influence in the proper quarters. In August 1770, it was decided that Washington should personally make a trip to the western region, where he located tracts for himself and military comrades and eventually was granted letters patent for tracts of land there. The lands involved were open to Virginians under terms of the Treaty of Lochaber of 1770, except for the lands located 2 miles south of Fort Pitt, now known as Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the United States, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 ended with the American Revolutionary War because Great Britain ceded the land in question to the United States in the Treaty of Paris (1783). Afterward, the U.S. government also faced difficulties in preventing frontier violence and eventually adopted policies similar to those of the Royal Proclamation. The first in a series of Indian Intercourse Acts was passed in 1790, prohibiting unregulated trade and travel in Native American lands. In 1823, the U.S. Supreme Court case \"Johnson v. M'Intosh\" established that only the U.S. government, and not private individuals, could purchase land from Native Americans.\n\nIn October 2013 the 250th anniversary of the Royal Proclamation was celebrated in Ottawa with a meeting of Indian leaders and Governor-General David Johnston. The Aboriginal movement Idle No More held birthday parties for this monumental document at various locations across Canada.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "59351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59351", "title": "Semicolon", "text": "Semicolon\n\nThe semicolon or semi colon (;) is a punctuation mark that separates major sentence elements. A \"semicolon\" can be used between two closely related independent clauses, provided they are not already joined by a coordinating conjunction. Semicolons can also be used in place of commas to separate items in a list, particularly when the elements of that list contain commas.\n\nThe first printed semicolon was the work of the Italian printer Aldus Manutius the Elder in 1494. Manutius established the practice of using the semicolon to separate words of opposed meaning and to allow a rapid change in direction in connecting interdependent statements. Ben Jonson was the first notable English writer to use the semicolon systematically. The modern uses of the semicolon relate either to the listing of items or to the linking of related clauses.\n\nAlthough terminal marks (i.e. full stops, exclamation marks, and question marks) mark the end of a sentence, the comma, semicolon and colon are normally sentence-internal, making them secondary boundary marks. The semicolon falls between terminal marks and the comma; its strength is equal to that of the colon.\n\n\nSemicolons are followed by a lower case letter, unless that letter would ordinarily be capitalized mid-sentence (e.g., the word \"I\", acronyms/initialisms, or proper nouns). Modern style guides recommend no space before them and one space after. They also typically recommend placing semicolons outside ending quotation marks, although this was not always the case. For example, the first edition of the \"Chicago Manual of Style\" (1906) recommended placing the semicolon inside ending quotation marks.\n\nApplications of the semicolon in English include:\n\nIn Arabic, the semicolon is called \"Filament Manque\" () which means literally \"a dotted comma\", and is written inverted ( ؛ ). In Arabic, the semicolon has several uses:\n\nIn Greek and Church Slavonic, a semicolon indicates a question, similar to a Latin question mark. To indicate a long pause or separate sections, each with commas (the semicolon's purpose in English), Greek uses, but extremely rarely, the \"άνω τελεία\", an interpunct ( · ).\n\nChurch Slavonic example: гдѣ єсть рождeйсѧ царь їудeйскій; (Where is the one who is born king of the Jews? - Matthew 2:1)\n\nIn French, a semicolon (\"point-virgule\", literally 'dot-comma') is a separation between two full sentences, used where either a colon or a comma would not be appropriate. The phrase following a semicolon has to be an independent clause, which is related to the previous one (but not explaining it, contrary to a sentence introduced by a colon).\n\nThe dash character is used in French writing too, but not as widely as the semicolon. Usage of these devices (semicolon and dash) varies from author to author.\n\nSome authors have spurned the semicolon throughout their works. Lynne Truss stated that \"Samuel Beckett spliced his way merrily through such novels as \"Molloy\" and \"Malone Dies\", thumbing his nose at the semicolon all the way,\" \"James Joyce preferred the colon, as he thought it was more authentically classical; P. G. Wodehouse did an effortlessly marvelous job without it; George Orwell tried to avoid the semicolon completely in \"Coming Up for Air,\" (1939);\" \"Martin Amis included just one semicolon in \"Money\" (1984);\" and \"Umberto Eco was congratulated by an academic reader for using no semicolons in \"The Name of the Rose\" (1983).\" In response to Truss, Ben MacIntyre, columnist in \"The Times\" (London), wrote: \"Americans have long regarded the semi-colon with suspicion, as a genteel, self-conscious, neither-one-thing-nor-the other sort of punctuation mark, with neither the butchness of a full colon nor the flighty promiscuity of the comma. Hemingway and Chandler and Stephen King wouldn’t be seen dead in a ditch with a semi-colon (though Truman Capote might). Real men, goes the unwritten rule of American punctuation, don’t use semi-colons.\" In \"A Man Without a Country\", Kurt Vonnegut writes that semicolons are \"transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.\"\n\nScripts comprising wide characters, such as kanji, use a full-width equivalent, ；, located at Unicode code point U+FF1B (fullwidth semicolon).\n\nUnicode characters are allocated for:\n\nRelated characters:\n\nIn computer programming, the semicolon is often used to separate multiple statements (for example, in Perl, Pascal, PL/I, and SQL; see Pascal: Semicolons as statement separators). In other languages, semicolons are called \"terminator\"s and are required after every statement (such as in Java, and the C family). Today semicolons as terminators has largely won out, but this was a divisive issue in programming languages from the 1960s into the 1980s. An influential and frequently-cited study in this debate was , which concluded strongly in favor of semicolon as a terminator:\n\nThe study has been criticized as flawed by proponents of semicolon as a separator, due to participants being familiar with a semicolon-as-terminator language and unrealistically strict grammar. Nevertheless, the debate ended in favor of semicolon as terminator. Therefore, semicolon provides structure to the programming language.\n\nSemicolons are optional in a number of languages, including BCPL, Eiffel, and Go, meaning that they are part of the formal grammar for the language, but can be inferred in many or all contexts (e.g. by end of line that ends a statement (in Go)). As languages can be designed without them, semicolons are considered an unnecessary nuisance by some.\n\nThe use of semicolons in control flow structures and blocks of code is varied  – semicolons are generally omitted after a closing brace, but included for a single statement branch of a control structure (the \"then\" clause), except in Pascal, where a semicolon terminates the entire if...then...else clause (to avoid dangling else) and thus is not allowed between a \"then\" and the corresponding \"else\", as this causes unnesting.\n\nThis use originates with ALGOL 60, and falls between the comma (,) – used as a list separator – and the period/full stop (.) – used to mark the end of the program. The semicolon, as a mark separating statements, corresponds to the ordinary English usage of separating independent clauses, and gives the entire program the gross syntax of a single ordinary sentence. Of these other characters, whereas commas have continued to be widely used in programming for lists (and rare other uses, such as the comma operator that separates expressions in C), they are rarely used otherwise, and the period as the end of the program has fallen out of use. The last major use of the comma, semicolon, and period hierarchy is in Erlang (1986), where commas separate expressions; semicolons separate clauses, both for control flow and for function clauses; and periods terminate statements, such as function definitions or module attributes, not the entire program. Drawbacks of having multiple different separators or terminators (compared to a single terminator and single grouping, as in semicolon-and-braces) include mental overhead in selecting punctuation, and overhead in rearranging code, as this requires not only moving lines around, but also updating the punctuation.\n\nIn some cases the distinction between a separator and a terminator is strong, such as early versions of Pascal, where a final semicolon yields a syntax error. In other cases a final semicolon is treated either as optional syntax, or as being followed by a null statement, which is either ignored or treated as a NOP (no operation or null command); compare trailing commas in lists. In some cases a blank statement is allowed, allowing a sequence of semicolons or the use of a semicolon by itself as the body of a control flow structure. For example, a blank statement (a semicolon by itself) stands for a NOP in C/C++, which is useful in busy waiting synchronization loops.\n\nOther languages (for instance, some assembly languages and LISP dialects, CONFIG.SYS and INI files) use semicolons to mark the beginning of comments.\n\nExample C code:\n\nint main() {\n\nConventionally, in many languages, each statement is written on a separate line, but this is not typically a requirement of the language. In the above example, two statements are placed on the same line; this is legal, because the semicolon separates the two statements. Thus programming languages like Java, the C family, Javascript etc. use semicolons to obtain a proper structure in the respective languages.\n\nThe semicolon is often used to separate elements of a string of text. For example, multiple e-mail addresses in the \"To\" field in some e-mail clients have to be delimited by a semicolon.\n\nIn Microsoft Excel, the semicolon is used as a list separator, especially in cases where the decimal separator is a comma, such as codice_1, instead of codice_2.\n\nIn MATLAB and GNU Octave, the semicolon can be used as a row separator when defining a vector or matrix (whereas a comma separates the columns within a row of a vector or matrix) or to execute a command silently, without displaying the resulting output value in the console.\n\nIn HTML, a semicolon is used to terminate a character entity reference, either named or numeric.\n\nIn some delimiter-separated values file formats, the semicolon is used as the separator character, as an alternative to comma-separated values.\n\nIn the argument list of a mathematical function formula_1, a semicolon may be used to separate variables from fixed parameters.\n\nIn differential geometry, a semicolon preceding an index is used to indicate the covariant derivative of a function with respect to the coordinate associated with that index.\n\nThe semicolon is commonly used as parts of emoticons, in order to indicate winking and/or crying.\n\nProject Semicolon is the name of a faith-based anti-suicide initiative (since the semicolon continues a sentence rather than ending it) which has led to the punctuation mark becoming a highly symbolic and popular tattoo.\n\nThe Humphrey point is sometimes used instead of a decimal point in duodecimal numbers.\n\nThere is much Scratch culture around the semicolon.\n\n"}

Tension grids are composed of tightly woven wire rope steel cables that create a taut floor strong enough for technicians to walk on.\n\nLighting instruments can be hung on a pipe grid just above the tension grid; there is no need for holes, as the light can shine through the grid, virtually unobstructed, to the stage. Cables and electrical wires can pass through, and special fixtures may be used to allow beams and other solid material to pass through. \nOriginally developed for use as a floor in anechoic chambers, this style of catwalk is popular in new and remodeled theatres due to the flexibility it provides. Use of a tension grid does not require working off of edges as a traditional catwalk does, as lights are over the walking surface, not next to it. As a result, many consider tension grids safer in terms of risk of falling.\n\nWall to wall wire grids are impossible to fall through making them a better solution than catwalks in venues where students or volunteers might work.\n\nNew construction cost in most US cities ranges from $65 per square foot to $100.\n\nTension grids require yearly inspections. Lights shining through the tension grid light up a section of the grid itself, which some audience members find distracting. The cables of the grid absorb and redirect some of the light from a fixture, leading to a negligible loss in total light output. Working on a tension grid can take time to get used to because of the compliant nature of the surface. This motion coupled with the illusion of no floor can be disconcerting to some. \n\nMost tension grids do not meet the structural standards of a traditional catwalk, however there are tension grids available rated for a live load of 40 pounds per square foot. The number of technicians permitted to work on a tension grid simultaneously can be limited, relative to a standard catwalk, due to relatively low load ratings.\n\nTension grids for theatrical catwalks are typically constructed of 1/8\" diameter black galvanized aircraft cable woven into a taut grid with 2\" spacing, which corresponds to an open area (transparency) of approximately 94%. Swaged fittings terminate the ends of the cables, which are secured at a perimeter frame. Tension grid frames are typically made of steel channel or rectangular tubing. Tension grid assemblies are often made up of tension grid modules arranged in a grid and resting on support structure suspended from ceiling structure above.\n"}

{"id": "2967874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2967874", "title": "Transect (urban)", "text": "Transect (urban)\n\nThe urban-to-rural transect is an urban planning model created by New Urbanist Andrés Duany. The transect defines a series of zones that transition from sparse rural farmhouses to the dense urban core. Each zone is fractal in that it contains a similar transition from the edge to the center of the neighborhood. The transect is an important part of the New Urbanism and smart growth movements. Duany's firm DPZ has embodied the transect philosophy into their SmartCode generic planning code for municipal ordinances.\n\nThe importance of transect planning is particularly seen as a contrast to modern Euclidean zoning and suburban development. In these patterns, large areas are dedicated to a single purpose, such as housing, offices, shopping, and they can only be accessed via major roads. The transect, by contrast, decreases the necessity for long-distance travel by any means.\n\nThe concept of the transect was borrowed from ecology. Ecological transects are used to describe changes in habitat over some gradient such as a change in topography or distance from a water body. Patrick Geddes, in his Valley Section of the early 20th century was among the first to proclaim that human settlement should be analyzed in the context of its natural region. Transects were later used by Ian McHarg in \"Design with Nature.\"\n\nA major feature of transect planning is that it incorporates a variety of residential and commercial spaces into a single neighborhood. A typical neighborhood would consist of a light commercial area with a bank, general store, pub, coffee shop, and apartments. Moving outwards from the center, residential density would gradually decrease starting with apartments to townhouses to fully detached houses. The central area would be a focus of transit and ideally be within walking distance from any point in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Transect has six zones, moving from rural to urban. It begins with two that are entirely rural in character: Rural preserve (protected areas in perpetuity); and Rural reserve (areas of high environmental or scenic quality that are not currently preserved, but perhaps should be).The transition zone between countryside and town is called the Edge, which encompasses the most rural part of the neighborhood, and the countryside just beyond. The Edge is primarily single family homes. Although Edge is the most purely residential zone, it can have some mixed-use, such as civic buildings (schools are particularly appropriate for the Edge). Next is General, the largest zone in most neighborhoods. General is primarily residential, but more urban in character (somewhat higher density with a mix of housing types and a slightly greater mix of uses allowed). At the urban end of the spectrum are two zones which are primarily mixed use: Center (this can be a small neighborhood center or a larger town center, the latter serving more than one neighborhood); and Core (serving the region — typically a central business district). Core is the most urban zone.\n\nThe character—from rural to highly urban—of each of the zones in the transect continuum is made up not only of the land uses and activities that take place in that zone, but the degree of development and the typology of that development. In contrast to conventional 20th-century zoning, which was for the most part concerned with land uses and activities and largely ignored issues of typology and community form (also known as urban form), transect-based zoning codes take up the issue of development typology as a principal concern.\n\nThe potential of the transect as an urban planning tool lies in:\n\n1) Education: it is easy to understand\n\n2) Coding: it can be directly translated into the familiar legal framework of Euclidean Zoning districts\n\n3) Immersive environments: this is one where all of the elements of the human environment work together to create something that is greater than the sum of the parts.\n\nThe transect contains other features: it creates a framework to control and promote growth in certain areas; it intends to increase pedestrian life, local safety, and community identity; and, it provides tools to protect and restore natural environments. A transect is a breakdown of city centre houses out to country houses\n\nMany of the features of transect planning cannot be reproduced without a change to municipal ordinances. For example, the transect encourages storefronts to push forward to the sidewalk, to allow window shopping, and push parking lots to the rear. In many municipalities, this design would not be permitted today under town planning bylaws. Hence, any effort to implement the principles of the transect must be accompanied by code changes (See the development of SmartCode).\n\n"}

The purpose of this article is mainly to show the use of some of the \"yapım ekleri\" \"structural suffixes\" of the Turkish language, as well as to give some of the structurally important words, like pronouns, determiners, postpositions, and conjunctions.\n\n\"See also Turkish language#Vocabulary.\"\n\nIn the ninth century, Turks began to convert to Islam and to use the Arabic alphabet. When the Seljuk Turks overran Iran (Persia), they adopted for official and literary use the Persian language—which meanwhile had borrowed many Armenian and Arabic words. Thus educated Turks had available for their use the vocabularies of three languages: Turkish, Arabic, and Persian.\n\nWhen the Ottoman Empire arose out of the remains of the Selcuk Empire in Anatolia, its official language, \"Osmanlıca\" or Ottoman Turkish, became the only language to approach English in the size of its vocabulary (according to #Lewis). However, common people continued to use \"kaba Türkçe\" or \"rough Turkish\" which contained much fewer loanwords and which is the basis of the modern Turkish language. \n\nWith the advent of the Turkish Republic in 1923 came the attempt to unify the languages of the people and the administration, and to westernize the country. The modern Turkish alphabet, based on the Latin script, was introduced. Also, Arabic and Persian words were replaced, as possible, by:\nTurkish words surviving in speech, obsolete Turkish words, new words formed regularly from the agglutinative resources of Turkish, thoroughly new words or formations. However, still a large portion of current Turkish words have Arabic or Persian origins.\nTurkish has words borrowed from Greek due to the Ottoman Empire having conquered the Byzantine Empire. There are also borrowings from other European languages, or from the common technical vocabulary of Europe.\nIn the latter case, the borrowings are usually taken in their French pronunciation.\n\nThe 2005 edition of \"Güncel Türkçe Sözlük\", the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association, contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin. Among the most significant foreign contributors to Turkish vocabulary are Armenian, Arabic, French, Persian, Italian, English, and Greek.\n\nThe suffix \"-ci\" attached to a noun denotes a person involved with what is named by the noun:\n\nThe suffix \"-lik\" attached to a noun or adjective denotes an abstraction, or an object involved with what is named by the noun:\n\nThe noun in \"-im\" denoting an instance of action was mentioned in the introduction to Turkish grammar.\n\nFor more examples on word derivations, see the \"related article: List of replaced loanwords in Turkish\".\n\nAdjectives can be distinguished as being\n\nFor an intensive form, the first consonant and vowel of a (descriptive) adjective can be reduplicated; a new consonant is added too, \"m, p, r,\" or \"s\", but there is no simple rule for which one:\n\nThe determinative adjectives, or determiners, are an essential part of the language, although Turkish takes some of its determiners from Arabic and Persian.\n\nThese are also demonstrative pronouns. Used with plural nouns, these adjectives represent the English \"those\" and \"these\"; there is no such inflexion of adjectives in Turkish.\n\nThe cardinal numbers are built up in a regular way from the following:\n\nUnits follow multiples of ten; powers of ten come in descending order. For example: \n\nThe cardinals are generally not used alone, but a general word for a unit is used, such as:\n\nRemembering that the plural suffix is not used when numbers are named, we have:\n\nFrom the \"cardinal\" numbers, others can be derived with suffixes:\n\nThe cardinal \"bir\" \"one\" can be used as an indefinite article. \nOther so-called indefinite adjectives might be listed as follows:\n\n\nAdded to a noun, \"-li\" or \"-siz\" indicates presence or absence, respectively, of what is named by the noun.\n\nThe suffix \"-li\" also indicates origin:\n\nFinally, added to the verbal noun in \"-me\", the suffix \"-li\" creates the necessitative verb.\n\nThe native speaker may perceive \"-meli\" as an indivisible suffix denoting compulsion.\n\nAdded to a noun for a person, \"-ce\" makes an adjective.\n\nAdjectives can generally serve as adverbs:\n\nThe adjective might then be repeated, as noted earlier. A repeated noun also serves as an adverb:\n\nThe suffix \"-ce\" makes nouns and adjectives into adverbs. One source (Özkırımlı, p. 155) calls it the \"benzerlik\" (\"similarity\") or \"görelik\" (from \"göre\" \"according to\") \"eki\", considering it as another case-ending.\n\nAdverbs of place include:\n\nThese can also be treated as adjectives and nouns (in particular, they can be given case-endings).\nAlso, the suffix \"-re\" can be added to the demonstrative pronouns \"o\", \"bu\", and \"şu\", as well as to the interrogative pronoun \"ne\", treated as a noun. The result has cases serving as adverbs of place:\n\nThe following are used after the genitive pronouns \"benim\", \"bizim\", \"senin\", \"sizin\", \"onun\", and \"kimin\", and after the absolute case of other pronouns and nouns:\n\nFor example, a certain company may describe its soft drink as:\n\nHowever, another company may say of itself:\n\nThus the label of postposition does not adequately describe \"gibi\"; Schaaik proposes calling it a predicate, because of its use in establishing similarity:\n\nThe particle \"ile\" can be both \"comitative\" and \"instrumental\"; it can also join the preceding word as a suffix. Examples:\n\nUsed after nouns and pronouns in the dative case are:\n\n\nThe following postpositions are case-forms of nouns with the third-person possessional suffix; they can be understood as forming nominal compounds, \"always indefinite\", with the preceding words (see also Turkish grammar#Nouns):\n\nSome samples include:\n\nSome Turkish conjunctions are borrowed from Persian and Arabic.\n\nThe \"cumulative\" sense of the English \"A and B\" can be expressed several ways:\n\nFor the \"adversative\" sense of \"but\" or \"only\", there are \"ama\" and \"fakat\" (both Arabic), also \"yalnız\" (which is also an adjective corresponding to \"alone\").\n\nFor emphasis: \"hem A hem B\" \"both A and B\".\n\nFor the sense of English \"(either)…or\":\nThe pattern of the last two can be extended:\n\n \"NE ABD NE AB TAM BAĞIMSIZ DEMOKRATİK TÜRKİYE\" \n \"Neither USA nor EU: Fully Independent Democratic Turkey\" \n(slogan on placard at demonstration);\n\nBoth \"çünkü\" and \"eğer\" are Persian; the latter is not generally needed, because the \"conditional\" form of the verb is available.\n\nThe Persian conjunction \"ki\" brings to Turkish the Indo-European style of relating ideas (#Lewis [XIII,15]):\nThus \"ki\" corresponds roughly to English \"that\", but with a broader sense:\nThe following is from a newspaper:\n\nThe verb-stem \"temizle-\" \"make clean\" is the adjective \"temiz\" \"clean\" with the suffix \"-le-\".

{"id": "43374421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43374421", "title": "Unmanned Aircraft System Simulation", "text": "Unmanned Aircraft System Simulation\n\nUnmanned aircraft system simulation focuses on training pilots (or operators) to control an unmanned aircraft or its payload from a control station. Flight simulation involves a device that artificially re-creates aircraft flight and the environment in which it flies for pilot training, design, or other purposes. It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc.\n\nManned simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities. Unlike manned simulation, unmanned aircraft system (UAS) simulation does not involve a pilot aboard the training device.\n\nManned flight simulators employ various types of hardware and software, depending on the modeling detail and realism that is required for the role in which they are to be employed. Designs range from PC laptop-based models of aircraft systems (called Part Task Trainers or PTTs), to replica cockpits for initial familiarization, to highly realistic simulations of the cockpit, flight controls and aircraft systems for more complete pilot training.\n\nThe use of unmanned systems by defense forces globally has grown substantially over the past decade, and is only expected to continue to grow significantly. In addition, unmanned systems will be used increasingly for commercial applications such as remote inspection of pipelines and hydroelectric installations, surveillance of forest fires, observation of critical natural resources, assessing natural disasters and a range of other applications. This increase in the use of UAS capabilities results in the need to have more highly skilled UAS pilots, sensor operators, and mission commanders.\n\nAn unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone and referred to as a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Its flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. The typical launch and recovery method of an unmanned aircraft is by the function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground. Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted aircraft, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed.\nA UAS is composed of the UAV, itself, as well as associated launch, recovery, and control hardware and software.\n\nUAVs are usually deployed for military and special operation applications, but are also used in a small but growing number of civil applications, such as policing and firefighting, and nonmilitary security work such as surveillance of pipelines. UAVs are often preferred for missions that are too \"dull, dirty or dangerous\" for manned aircraft.\n\nUAS Simulation Training allows UAV operators to train in real-time to operate UAVs in a virtual environment that is realistic and accurate, but without the risks and constraints of a real flight. UAS simulation includes:\n\nUAS Simulation Training combines an open architecture with commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and simulation software that helps the use of proprietary designs to provide a comprehensive, platform-agnostic training system. Customers benefit from greater flexibility for evolution, networking, distributed mission training and combination within an integrated training environment. UAS is a solution that optimizes operational readiness while minimizing the use of live assets to train and prepare the integrated mission team for operations. The comprehensive solution also prepares the integrated mission team (pilot, payload specialist, and commanding officer) in platform operating procedures, data interpretation and analysis, and team interaction.\n\nPotential Air Force UAS pilots and sensor operators attend three and a half months of specialized training courses, most of which is simulated. In simulated training for the Predator, operators use a manual control stick, rudder system and monitor system that is the same as the live simulator. The Air Force’s primary UAS training bases are at Holloman Air Force Base, NM, Cannon AFB, NM, Ellsworth AFB, SD, and Whiteman AFB, MO, but will take initial flight training in Pueblo, CO.\n\nArmy soldiers receive training on smaller, easier to maneuver UAS, such as the Raven and Puma, from master trainers. Master trainers are selected from bases around the world and are given instruction at Ft. Benning, GA. These master trainers then train units at their home base. Army operators for larger UAS, such as the Shadow and Gray Eagle, conduct training in Ft. Huachuca, AZ because of its remote location. These operators are UAS fight specialist for a single specific model. This is due to the different capabilities and functions of each air craft. Training is a combination of live and simulated training to teach new operators. Training is easily simulated because it is almost the same experience as live training in the aircraft that is operated by a Ground Control Station (GCS).\n\nThe standard for the Navy was to use pilots who have completed at least one piloting tour before allowing training in operating a UAS. With the advancement and economy of simulators, the Navy is beginning to train enlisted personnel with flight experience to become operators. Capt. Patrick Smith, a Fire Scout program manager was quoted to state, “Ideally, we take [potential operators] from the SH-60 [SeaHawk] community and add them to the five-week program, mainly simulator-based.\" The Navy conducts UAS training in Ft. Huachuca, AZ for live simulation or military installations near Patuxent River, MD for the Fire Scouts.\n\nIn 2014, Marines that complete the Basic School Officer course in Quantico, V.A., will have taken training in small UAS (Raven and Puma). UAS are not widely used in the Marines, but as the UAS become smaller and more mobile, they will become more integrated in mission resources. Marines recently started to receive training from the Group I (under 20 pounds) UAS Training and Logistics Support Activity in Camp Lejeune, N.C.\n\nUAS in inventory for each branch of service:\n\n\nFirefighters, police, miners, and weather researchers are now using UAVs (commonly referred to as drones), which were first used in military sectors. The drones used by police and firefighters are the same type of drones; however, they are used for different purposes. UAVs have gone beyond the human capacity of lifting heavy loads, performing daring photography amidst a heavy storm, and digitizing images that can be converted into 3D maps.\n\nWeather researchers use different drones to help predict weather, photograph storms and measure temperature. Drones are very essential for weather crews in predicting wind speed and temperature, wind direction, air temperature and pressure (Aerosonde Mark 4). Other drones are used for taking images of storm systems, even inside the storm itself. Like the Mark 4, NASA's Global Hawk is used to measure air temperature, wind speed, and pressure, but unlike the Mark 4, it can take images of the storm system.\n\nIn mining, drones help miners with tasks such as inspection and maintenance, carrying heavy equipment, and even carrying out tasks 24 hours a day/7 days a week. The mining industry uses drones such as Responder and Serenity to assist mining crews with maintenance, inspection, and imagery. Some drones within the mining industry assist workers with photography of the sediments to be mined so it can be calculated in terms of volume for removal and the stockpile of sediment graded by workers.\n\nIn police forces, drones are used for bomb detonation, response to incidents, pursuing criminals in the air, and determining a suspect’s location using high tech camera systems (Viking 400-S). Other uses for drones in police sectors are to record incidents, create maps of the incidents in 3D models, and then later send them to officers’ smart phones (Sensefly eBee). Other drones, such as the Kaman drop supplies and equipment for officers, as well as transport officers to and back from the crime scene. The E300 is used to stop criminals and record an incident.\n\nFirefighters use the same drones, but for different purposes. For example, ELIMCO’s E300 is used to put out fires, the Viking 400-S uses a camera to photograph incidents, then later transmits the images back to firefighting personnel for mapping the incidents electronically. The Information Processing Systems’ MCV, like the E300 is used for putting out wildfires and man-made fires. The eBee, like its police variant takes photographs with a 16 MP camera, which is used to create 3D models of maps through integrating technology from Google Maps. It is later sent to firefighting personnel smart phones. The Kaman, like its police variant, is used to supply firefighters and victims of fires, and to provide medical assistance. The Defikopter sends defibrillators to victims of heart attack. To locate a victim, it uses a GPS system.\n\nThere are two primary roles or purposes for UAS in higher education:\n\n\nAt the University of North Dakota (UND) Bachelor of Science in Aeronautics program, simulators are used for both operator certification and research purposes. For operator certification, UND uses Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) simulators specific to a particular vehicle (e.g., ScanEagle, MQ-8, etc.). Actual qualification training is on hold until the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) puts standards in place for the use of UAS in United States airspace. However, students can learn basic operation principles and how UAS will function in national airspace. UND also conducts research funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory on task loading of UAS operators. This research compares single operators versus multi-operator crews and full auto-piloted systems versus remotely piloted systems.\n\nEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL uses simulators in an undergraduate UAS operator program awarding a Bachelor of Science degree in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Science. Primarily, this program trains UAS operators, but it also serves a research role to test the application of UAS in national airspace.\n\nSeveral other schools offer non-engineering based UAS undergraduate programs, of which simulators are an integral part. Some examples include:\n\n\nUAV Simulators generally focus on low-level flight control and coordination by using complex physics-based models that are geared towards accuracy. These simulators requires domain expertise and complex knowledge to build, learn and operate the simulator itself. Alternate simulators are being developed such as Agent Based Modeling and Simulation for UAS, especially by military.\n\nAgent based modeling and simulation of UAV focuses on specialized issues such as coordination and planning. For example, the CoUAV. simulator focuses on cooperative search and MAS-Planes focuses on request servicing by decentralized coordination. Agent based simulation has also been used for UAV flight dynamic simulation modeling.\n\nAgent based modeling and simulation has been used for managing missions for UAS. The authors used Codarra Avatar for their experiments. Codarra Avatar is a lightweight UAV which has been specifically built for small-scale reconnaissance and surveillance missions. This UAV can be assembled and disassembled very quickly and transported in a backpack. However, in becoming an autonomous UAV, the Codarra Avatar faces challenges of flight time, flight range, durability, limited computational power, limited sensory data, and flight regulations and restrictions. The authors developed Agent-Flight Control System Architecture (FCS) to combat the issues faced with the UAV.\n\nFCS has an agent that sits at the top of a control tree, receives data at regular intervals, and issues high level waypoint commands. The agent is designed in JACK, an agent-oriented programming language. The behavior of agents defined using JACK are structured around the BDI (Belief, Desire, Intentions) theory of agency. The mission Management System is designed using the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) Approach that was developed by Colonel John Boyd. Authors conducted successful tests in Melbourne, Australia, using an FCS Architecture on the Codarra Avatar UAV.\n\n"}

One-time personal physician to Ali Pasha, the 19th-century Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina, Meksi produced the first translation of the New Testament into Albanian with the help and sponsorship of the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS). Meksi did not live to see his work's publication however, which was supervised by Gregory IV of Athens. As a member of \"Filiki Etaireia\", a secret society whose purpose was to establish an independent Greek state, Meksi joined the Greeks in the Siege of Tripolitsa during their war of independence against the Ottoman Empire and died shortly afterwards.\n\nAs well as its value to Albanian Christians, who could for the first time read the Gospels in their own language, Meksi's work advanced the study of written Albanian, and in particular informed the work of 19th-century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander, August Schleicher, and Johann Georg von Hahn. Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation.\n\nMeksi was born in 1770 in Labovë, a village near Gjirokastër, and pursued secondary studies in Ioannina, then an important Ottoman provincial center (now in Greece). His first employment was as a folk physician to the court of Ali Pasha, the Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina, a position he held until 1803. Armed with a letter of recommendation from Ali Pasha, Meksi was admitted to the University of Naples in Italy, where he studied medicine under Dr. Nicola Acuto and practiced in a hospital administered by the parish of San Giovanni a Carbonara. After completing his studies in 1808, Meksi returned to Yanina and once again served in Ali Pasha's court, this time as one of his four physicians. His colleagues were Dr. Metaxa, (degree in medicine from the University of Paris), Dr. Saqeralliu (degree in medicine from the University of Vienna), and Dr. Loukas Vagias, (brother of Thanasis Vagias, with a degree in medicine from Leipzig University).\n\nAfter falling out of favor with Ali Pasha, for reasons unknown, Meksi left the court in 1810 to travel around Europe. During a brief stay in Venice he began to develop an interest in the Albanian alphabet and grammar. He published two translations into Albanian during 1814, both now lost, one of which was a religious work by Abbé Claude Fleury (1640–1723).\n\nMeksi also wrote a grammar of the Albanian language in Albanian. It too has been lost, but it is mentioned in many letters reporting Meksi's work as an Albanian philologist written by Robert Pinkerton to his superiors at the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), which subsequently sponsored the translation of the New Testament into Albanian. The work must have been written before 1819 and may be either the first Albanian grammar or the second, after that of Jani Evstrat Vithkuqari; it is not known which was published first.\n\nIn this period Meksi also created a new Albanian alphabet, rationalizing and consolidating the many different pre-existing alphabets, employing a mix of Greek and Latin characters. Using his new alphabet, he wrote a book called \"Orthography of the Albanian language\", ().\n\nPinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's representative in Moscow, had met that year with a community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In a letter to his superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied a large part of the ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.\n\nIn 1819, apparently with the blessing of his superiors at the BFBS, Pinkerton met with Meksi (referring him as \"Evangelos Mexicos\") in Istanbul. Meksi, who was then a teacher in Serres, had been recommended to Pinkerton because of his Albanian grammar book. Pinkerton also relates in one of his letters to the BFBS that Meksi was well regarded by the Albanian community, the Greek Orthodox Church, and by Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople. Gregory, according to Pinkerton, also offered to find two suitable clergymen to assist Meksi in his endeavor. Lastly, Pinkerton recommended that the Greek alphabet be used as the most suitable for the Albanian language. On October 19, 1819, Pinkerton and Meksi concluded a contract to translate the New Testament into Albanian on behalf of the society. It was agreed that the Bible would have to be translated into the Albanian dialect of Yanina. Meksi completed the work in two years, ten months earlier than the contract's deadline.\n\nEarly in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to supervise the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, and that the only outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task. In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea, Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.\n\nOn March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's secretary in Corfu, sent a letter to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 piastras and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns. On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to hear it in Albanian. In July 1827 the form in which the first 500 copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London. The entire edition amounted to 2,000 copies.\n\nAlthough Gjirokastriti's edition of the New Testament was written in Albanian, it used the Greek alphabet. It is not known which alphabet Meksi used in his own manuscript.\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople was not against the work of Meksi or the Bible Society at that time. On the contrary, for the translation the British missionaries successfully appealed to Gregory V and enlisted the help of an Orthodox bishop, Gjirokastriti, for the final edition of the New Testament in Albanian.\n\nMeksi was a member of the \"Filiki Etaireia\", a secret society whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule over the Balkans and to establish an independent Greek state. When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821, after his translation had been completed, Meksi joined the Greeks in the Siege of Tripolitsa. Despite suffering from a serious bout of pneumonia, he continued to work as a physician during the war. He is also said to have taken part in the negotiations leading to an agreement proposed by Theodoros Kolokotronis that permitted the Albanians who were defending Tripolitsa to leave unharmed, an arrangement that helped the Greeks to capture the town from the Turks.\n\nMeksi did not live to see the 1827 publication of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51. The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000 copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty. A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens, but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.\n\nMeksi's work was important for the development of written Albanian, and his endeavors strengthened the conviction that a stable Albanian alphabet had to be created. His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander's studies of the Albanian language, which definitively refuted the thesis that the language had a Tatar origin. Von Xylander concluded that Albanian had an Indo-European root.\n\nTwo other international scholars also studied the Albanian language mainly based on Meksi's translation of the New Testament: August Schleicher, who stated that his knowledge of the conjugation of Albanian verbs was based on Meksi's work, and Johann Georg von Hahn an Austrian diplomat, philologist, and specialist in Albanian history, language, and culture, who translated the Bible into Gheg Albanian with the help of Kostandin Kristoforidhi.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8735708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8735708", "title": "Video game localization", "text": "Video game localization\n\nVideo game localization is the preparation of video game software and hardware for sale in a new region or country. Although translating the text is a large part of localization, the process includes any changes made to a game, including altering art assets, creating new packaging and manuals, recording new audio, transforming hardware, cutting out whole portions of the game due to differing cultural sensitivities and/or local legal requirements, and even adding sections to replace cut content.\nThe decision to localize a game relies heavily on economic factors, such as the potential profits that could be made in a new country. As such, the process is usually undertaken either by the game developers themselves or by a third-party translating company, though unauthorized fan localizations can occur if a translation is poor quality or if a game is not going to be released in a specific language. As an industrial field, localization is still in development and lacks consistency in terms of implementation and importance. Gathering information about industrial localization practices can often be difficult because of the lack of consistency between companies, as well as non-disclosure agreements many translators have to sign.\n\nThe goal of localization is to create an enjoyable, non-confusing play experience for the end user by paying heed to their specific cultural context while being faithful to the source material. The suspension of disbelief is of utmost importance to the process; if a player feels as though the product was not meant for them, or if the localization creates confusion or difficulty in comprehension, this may break immersion and disrupt the player's ability to continue the game.\n\nThe founding concepts of game localization can be seen early in videogame history, as in the case of the localization of Pac-Man. The original transliteration of the Japanese title would be “Puck-Man,” but the decision was made to change the name when the game was imported to the United States out of fear that the word ‘Puck’ would be vandalized into an obscenity. In addition, the names of the ghosts were originally based on colors - roughly translating to “Reddie,” “Pinky,” “Bluey,” and “Slowly.” Rather than translate these names exactly, they were renamed to Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. This choice maintained the odd-man-out style of the original names without adhering to their exact meaning. The change in cultural context between the two countries provoked a change in the game text that was not a precise translation.\n\nAn important concern for early localization was the limited amount of processing space available to house text strings that were longer than the originals, as was often the case with the NES and SNES. Ted Woolsey, translator of Final Fantasy VI, recounts having to continually cut down the English text due to limited capacity.\nOften the budgets and production times for localizations were short, resulting in translations that were either confusing or entirely re-written. Early translations were sometimes “literally done by a 'programmer with a phrase book'.” For instance, the original translation for the Sega Genesis game Beyond Oasis (original Japanese title, Story of Thor) was discarded by the English editor because it was nonsensical. Instead, it was completely re-written without any input from the translator. Sometimes the poor quality of the translation helped make the game more notable, as in the case of the notoriously poor translation of Zero Wing, whose text “All Your Base Are Belong to Us” became an early Internet meme.\n\nTechnology in the early 2000s expanded to allow text to be stored in ASCII strings instead of in picture format, allowing for more efficient processing and more storage space for housing text. Better audio capabilities and reliance on voice acting created new challenges and avenues for translation, allowing the use of dubbing while also adding the burden of translating and recording new audio. As graphics improved and games relied more on cinematics, more attention had to be paid to lip-syncing as well as visual gestures that might be culturally-specific.\n\nIn present times, there has been significant uptake in the amount of text and dialogue in a game, especially for triple-A RPGs. For instance, the team in charge of localizing Fable II into five languages consisted of 270 actors and 130 personnel- a far cry from the lone programmer with a phrase book. Likewise, the dialogue scripts for contained over 40 novels worth of text. Director of audio and localization Shauna Perry reports that the game had as much audio as ten recorded back-to-back. The length and intensity of these projects presents never-before-seen complexity in the localization process.\n\nDepending on the financial viability of importing a game to a new locale, a number of different levels of localization may be undertaken. The first level is no localization. A game may still be imported into a region in the original language if there is a potential market for it, but no efforts to localize the game will occur, to cut back on costs. The second level is box and documentation localization, in which the box and documentation or manuals for the game will be translated, but not the game itself. This tactic may be used if the game has little text or story, such as early arcade games, or if the target locale is expected to have a decent command of the original language, as in the importation of some English-language games such as \"Secret of Mana\" or \"Terranigma\" into Scandinavian countries. The third level of localization is partial localization, in which game text is translated but voiceover files aren’t. This helps cut down on the cost of hiring actors and re-recording all of the dialogue, while still making the game comprehensible in another language. Voiceover dialogue that doesn’t appear on screen may be subtitled. The final level of localization is full localization, where in all of a game's assets will be translated, including voiceover, game text, graphics, and manuals. This is the most expensive option, and is usually only undertaken by AAA game companies.\n\nOfficially produced localizations generally fit into one of two shipping models: post-gold or sim-ship. The post-gold localization model is undertaken when the original game has already been completed, and usually has already been released. As a result, there is a lag between the release of the original and the release of the localized versions. The post-gold model allows localizers to access a completed game rather than working with incomplete bits and pieces, and generally allow for more time to complete translations, so fewer translation errors occur with this method. This model is used commonly by Japanese AAA producers, though these companies are starting to move towards a sim-ship method for marketing reasons.\n\nThe sim-ship model, short for simultaneous-shipment, allows a game to be released in multiple regions at the same time. Because games have a short shelf-life and are prone to be pirated, there is a profit incentive to release games simultaneously across the globe. However, with this method, a completed version of the game is unlikely to be made available for localization workers, resulting in a greater risk for translation errors, as crucial context and game information may be missing. Most Western games follow the sim-ship method of production.\n\nIn addition to these shipping models, different production methods may be used to create the localization, usually either outsourced or in-house production. Most game companies in North America and Europe rely on an outsourcing model of production, and this model is popular amongst emerging game development markets such as Chile, Russia, and China. In the outsourcing model, a company that specializes in game translation is hired to undertake the entire process. Oftentimes outsourced companies do not have the full game available to work with, and are dealing with only portions of the game's text or art, resulting in a “blind localization.” In a blind localization, only a limited amount of information about the final game is available, resulting in a lack of context which can hinder productive localization. Sometimes, even if a game is incomplete, the developer may send a mostly-finished version of the game so that translators can play through the game and get a better sense of the text they’re working with.\n\nIn the outsourcing model, developers and publishers will usually provide the translation company with a localization kit. A localization kit may contain elements such as general information about the project (including deadlines, contact information, software details), resources about the game itself (a walkthrough, plot or character descriptions, cheat codes), reference materials (glossaries of terms used in the game world or used for the specific hardware), software (such as computer-aided translation tools), code, and the assets to be translated (text files, graphics, audio, and so forth). An insufficient localization kit can severely hamper translation efforts.\n\nAlternate to the outsourcing model, translators may control the localization in-house. This model is more common for Japanese developers, most notably Square Enix. In the in-house model, the localization process is completely controlled by the developer, though it is common for freelance translators to be hired on a project-basis. Translators working in this model still usually receive a localization kit, but also have greater access to the original game and to the original artists and authors. Because Japanese developers rely on the post-gold model, the in-house translators favored by these companies usually have full access to the completed game. This allows the translation to have fewer context mistakes and results in an overall smoother localization. The downside is the long delay between the game's release in the original country and the subsequent release of the localized version, which is of concern in a global market. Companies like Square Enix are beginning to move towards a simultaneous shipping model, with a shorter release time between different versions.\n\nFinally, a game can be localized through the unauthorized efforts of fans. Fans may be willing to put forth a huge amount of unpaid labor in order to localize a game if it would be otherwise unavailable. If a game is not going to be released in a specific territory, for instance due to doubts about making sufficient profits, fans may take up the slack and release a translation on their own. For instance, the Game Boy Advance game Mother 3 (2006) was not going to be released in North America, possible due to poor sales of the previous installment of the series, Mother 2 (renamed EarthBound in North America). Fans petitioned Nintendo to localize the game, and when that failed, they undertook the process themselves, resulting in a fan-helmed English-language release of the game in 2008.\n\nInferior localization may also prompt fan action, as in the case of the fan community Clan DLAN. The group has undertaken the work of localizing many games, mods, cheats, guides, and more into Castilian Spanish when the official versions were of poor quality, such as with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.\n\nThe major types of localization are as follows.\n\nWhen games are more story- than action-driven, culturalising them can be challenging because of all the premises the designers are taking for granted in the development of the plot. Asian gamers seem to prefer more childlike characters, while Western countries might emphasize adult features. An example of the changes that are likely to happen during localization is Fatal Frame (known in Japan as \"Zero\" and known in Europe as \"Project Zero\") (Tecmo 2001). In the original Japanese version the female protagonist, Miku, was a frightened seventeen-year-old girl looking for her brother Mafuyu who disappeared after entering a haunted mansion. In the US and European versions Miku is nineteen, has Western features, and is not wearing the original Japanese school uniform. Unfortunately, developers did not think necessary to change her brother's appearance, so when players do find Mafuyu at the end of the game they do not seem to be blood-related.\n\nA similar thing happens with the depiction of blood, and real historical events; many things have to be readjusted to fit the country's tolerance and taste in order not to hurt sensibilities. This is probably one of the reasons why so many games take place in imaginary worlds. This customisation effort draws on the knowledge of geopolitical strategists, like Kate Edwards from Englobe. During the 2006 Game Developers Conference in California she explained the importance of being culturally aware when internationalising games in a presentation called \"Fun vs. Offensive: Balancing the 'Cultural Edge' of Content for Global Games\" (Edwards 2006). Both developers and publishers want to please their clients. Gamers are not particularly interested in where the game comes from, or who created it any more than someone buying a new car or DVD player. A product for mass consumption only keeps the branding features of the trademark; all the other characteristics might be subject to customisation due to the need to appeal to the local market. Therefore, the translation will be in some cases an actual recreation, or, to put it in the words of Mangiron & O’Hagan (2006), a \"transcreation\", where translators will be expected to produce a text with the right \"feel\" for the target market. It is important for translators to be aware of the logic behind this. Video games are a software product, and as such, they will have manuals and instructions, as well as interactive menus and help files. This will call for technical translation. On the other hand, we will also find narration and dialogue closer to literary texts or film scripts where a more creative translation would be expected. However, unlike most forms of translation, video games can adapt or even change the original script, as long as it is in the search of enhanced fun and playability of the target culture. We can only find a parallel of this type of practice in the translation of children's literature where professionals often adapt or alter the original text to improve children's understanding and enjoyment of the book.\n\nSCEE David Reeves, has stated that the main reason that Europe is often affected by significant content delays is because of language localization. He stated \"the problem is that there isn't enough incentive for developers to work on multiple language translations during development. Hence, Europeans suffer delays and may never see a particular title\". He also commented on why the UK and Ireland which are English speaking countries, also experience the same delays as those in continental Europe with many different languages despite little or no modification. He stated \"With PlayStation Store we could probably go in the UK almost day and date. But then what are the Germans and the French going to say to me? That I'm Anglo-centric\" indicating that the reason that these countries also must wait is to avoid criticism from other large European gaming countries such as Germany and France.\n\nOftentimes localization changes include adjusting a game to consider specific cultural sensitivities. These changes may be self-enforced by the developers themselves, or enacted by national or regional rating boards (Video game content rating system). However, games are still sometimes released with controversial or insensitive material, which can lead to controversy or recall of the product.\n\nGames localized for import into Germany often have significant changes made due to the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle’s (USK) strict policies against blood and gore, profanity, and symbols associated with racial hatred, such as Nazi symbolism.\n\nFor instance, the German version of Team Fortress 2 (2007) has no blood or detached body parts as a result of this regulation, which can cause difficulty for players as it is hard to tell if an enemy has been hit or taken damage (218). As a result, mods known as “bloodpatches” have been created for this and many German games that allow the blood and gore of the original game to be unlocked. Despite a significant overhaul of the graphics, the German localization of the World War II game Wolfenstein (2009) contained a single visible swastika on an art asset. As a result, Raven Software recalled the game.\n\nChina also has strict censorship rules, and forbids content that endangers the “unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state” or the “social moralities or fine national cultural traditions,” amongst other qualifications. As a result, the Swedish PC game Hearts of Iron (2002), set during World War II, was banned because the historically accurate maps depicted Manchuria, West Xinjiang, and Tibet as independent states. Additionally, Taiwan was shown to be a territory of Japan, as was accurate for the time period. However, these inclusions were considered harmful to China's territorial integrity, so the game was forbidden from being legally imported. The localization of Football Manager (2005) was similarly banned because Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China were all treated as separate teams, putting them on equal footing.\n\nVideo games come accompanied by a variety of texts, for example manuals, dubbing scripts, and subtitles that need translating, but they also have other type of texts in a format only common to utility software, like a word processor, or an internet browser. All these programs have one thing in common: information and commands are readily available at the click of a button. It is what we call ‘interactivity’. The interactive element of computer programs has serious consequences for translators because it means that access to texts and information is random, i.e., each user will activate a particular message or command at a different point, or not at all. An arbitrary sequence of events does not allow for linear texts and contextual information, therefore, translators lose two of the most important sources needed in the decision making process: co-text and context. When the program is still unfinished or no localization kit has been prepared, some information is still available, although difficult to obtain, from similar manuals, the localization manager, or the actual technical team responsible for the software. Esselink (2000) is probably one of the best references for the localization of utility software and web pages.\n\nUnfortunately, the localization software industry has not been able to create a GUI (graphical user interface) localization tool for translators to use with video games, like the ones used in the translation of utility software and web pages. These programs (like Catalyst and Passolo) allow users to work directly but safely with the game code, generating a visual representation of the final product, which means that translators can see exactly what the end result will look like and adjust the text or the interface to suit the space available as well as the general look. The LRC (Localization Research Center) and LISA (The Localization Industry Standards Association) have ample information on these programs.\n\nLinguistic assets will be utilised in a variety of ways at different times throughout the creation, development, and launch of the game, mainly: the game itself, which has a variety of texts in multiple formats, the official web site of the game, promotional articles, game patches and updates.\n\nWithin these products there are different textual types, each of which has its own characteristics and purpose. Because we are dealing with a multimedia product, the challenges translators have to face are also multimedia. Within the same project they have to deal with a wide variety of issues like reproducing the oral quality of dialogue in writing, lip-synching for dubbing, space and time constraints for subtitling, number of characters for subtitle, UI, etc. The following paragraphs are an attempt to classify the several textual types that accompany the standard PC video game:\n\n(Written form. May be a Pagemaker or a Word format) Although it always has some attractive and engaging creative writing, partly promotional partly literary, most of the manual would normally be filled with didactic texts when telling players the instructions to be followed to fully enjoy the game. Manuals would also include technical texts with the appropriate hardware and software specifications to be able to run the game application. In addition players will always find corporative and legal texts, informing users of their rights and responsibilities attached to the acquisition of an entertainment software product.\n\n(Written form. Pagemaker or Word format) Like manuals, game boxes and packaging present a mixture of textual types, the difference being the space provided, limited not only by the size of it but also by images of the game, logos of the companies involved and legal labelling requirements. It mixes an alluring promotional text, together with concise technical information and legal notices.\n\n(Written form. WordPad/Rich text format) This small .txt file is probably the last thing in the development process. It is used to inform users of all the last-minute adjustments and how to make sure that the product runs smoothly, as well as to correct mistakes and typos in the printed material, such as manual and packaging. It is mainly a technical text.\n\n(Written form. HTML or Java format) It mixes a promotional text with a journalistic one, but it will also have technical details like minimum requirements, etc. A lot of the information offered through the official web will be similar to the one that was shipped with the game. But websites tend to include previews and reviews of the product, notice boards, customer support and downloadable files to fix specific problems, or patches with new language versions, as well as screenshots, concept art, thematic screen savers, merchandising, and fan blogs.\n\n(Spoken form. There will be a separate sound file per utterance. Written scripts will normally be in spreadsheets or Word tables.) Speech delivered by game characters where registers, accents, and idiosyncrasies have to be conveyed into other languages. Sometimes an extra column is included to add inflection comments for the dubbing director. A part of the dubbing script may include atmospheric utterances also in a spoken form. Many games might feature characters talking or reacting to players’ actions. These characters may have little or no relevance to the plot, but their inclusion and to the immersion of the player in the virtual world. No synchronisation is normally required, but orality has to be maintained.\n\n(Written form. Spreadsheets and tables are preferred for this although subtitles might be hard-coded in order to synchronize them with video and animations). Oral text in written form. The dubbing script may be applied directly in the subtitling of the game, which results in cluttered and fast subtitles with no character limit per line, nor lines per subtitle. In addition, translators may be faced with the fact that not all languages allow for the same freedom when writing subtitles. Often translators will have to apply techniques used in the translation of children's literature and comic-books to convey certain characteristics that would otherwise be lost. Time and space constraints are very relevant here.\n\n(Written form. Table format, sometimes hard-coded text file due to the interactivity of each item). Space in menus, pop-up windows and hint captions is at a premium and redesigning is rarely an option, so translators will have to maintain a similar number of characters to that of the original label. Similarly to what happens in software localization, video games may have very detailed and crowded menu options to control different features of the game such as difficulty level, as well as graphic display selection, mouse sensitivity, or feedback preferences.\n\n(Written form. A multi-layered graphic format will be needed). Players will normally find this type of graphic-text in game names but they can often be seen throughout the game as part of the branding of the product, as well as in advertisements.\n\nIn the 2010s there has been debate about how Japanese games are localized, particularly for Nintendo platforms. Some fans consider resulting changes to plot and characterization as marring the original artistic vision, and some object to sexual content being removed or bowlderized. Localization of Nintendo games is commonly handled by a Nintendo division called the Treehouse. In the face of Nintendo's unwillingness to communicate about localization, speculation and conspiracy theories circulated among enthusiasts, and several employees of the Treehouse were alleged to be responsible for unpopular changes.\n\nAllison Rapp, a Treehouse employee not directly involved in localization, garnered controversy due to her comments on Twitter. Attention on Rapp was heightened as part of the Gamergate controversy by the circulation of an undergraduate essay by Rapp which favored cultural relativism regarding sexualization of minors in Japanese media. The essay argued against the sort of censorship that the Treehouse's critics decried. Some however interpreted the essay as defending the exploitation of children, and readers of The Daily Stormer organized a letter-writing campaign to have her fired. That initiative was controversial within the Gamergate movement, with some supporters considering it justifiable treatment of an ideological opponent, while others considered the campaign against Rapp to be unethical or not aligned with the movement's goals. Rapp was subsequently fired, though Nintendo issued a statement that the reason was that Rapp had held a second job against company policy. She maintains that her controversial online presence was the true cause.\n\n\n\n"}
