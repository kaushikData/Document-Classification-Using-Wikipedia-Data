{"id": "218840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218840", "title": "Abuse of process", "text": "Abuse of process\n\nAbuse of process is a cause of action in tort arising from one party making misusing or perversion of regularly issued court process (civil or criminal) not justified by the underlying legal action. It is a common law intentional tort. It is to be distinguished from malicious prosecution, another type of tort that involves misuse of the public right of access to the courts.\n\nThe elements of a valid cause of action for abuse of process in most common law jurisdictions are as follows: (1) the existence of an ulterior purpose or motive underlying the use of process, and (2) some act in the use of the legal process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceedings. Abuse of process can be distinguished from malicious prosecution, in that abuse of process typically does not require proof of malice, lack of probable cause in procuring issuance of the process, or a termination favorable to the plaintiff, all of which are essential to a claim of malicious prosecution. \"Process,\" as used in this context, includes not only the \"service of process,\" i.e. an official summons or other notice issued from a court, but means any method used to acquire jurisdiction over a person or specific property that is issued under the official seal of a court. Typically, the person who abuses process is interested only in accomplishing some improper purpose that is collateral to the proper object of the process and that offends justice, such as an unjustified arrest or an unfounded criminal prosecution. Subpoenas to testify, attachments of property, executions on property, garnishments, and other provisional remedies are among the types of \"process\" considered to be capable of abuse.\n\nThe principles which led to a finding of an abuse of process in the UK were stated in \"Johnson v Gore Wood & Co\" by Lord Bingham.\n\nA cause of action for abuse of process is similar to the action for malicious prosecution in that both actions are based on and involve the improper use of the courts and legal systems. The primary difference between the two legal actions is that malicious prosecution concerns the malicious or wrongful commencement of an action, while, on the other hand, abuse of process concerns the improper use of the legal process after process has already been issued and a suit has commenced. In abuse of process, the legal process is misused for some purpose which is considered improper under the law. Thus technically, the service of process itself—in the form of a summons—could be considered abuse of process under the right circumstances, e.g. fraudulent or malicious manipulation of the process itself, but in malicious prosecution, the wrongful act is the actual filing of the suit itself for improper and malicious reasons. As noted above, the three requirements of malice, lack of probable cause in the issuance of the process, and a termination of the prior proceeding favorable to the plaintiff, are essential elements for malicious prosecution. Most jurisdictions do not require any of these three elements in order to make out a prima facie case for abuse of process.\n\nA cause of action for abuse of process may lie in situations where a criminal proceeding is brought against a defendant for improper motives. For example, in \"Lader v. Benkowitz\", a pleading was held to state a good cause of action for abuse of process when it alleged that defendant hotel owner had threatened to have the plaintiff arrested on a warrant issued at the behest of the defendant on a charge of disorderly conduct.\n\nThe allegedly improper motive was the hotel owner's underlying purpose of compelling plaintiff to pay a bill owed for plaintiff's alleged rental of a room in defendant's hotel. It was claimed that through the unlawful use of the warrant and threat of arrest, the defendant was able to obtain the sum of money allegedly owed by plaintiff. In denying defendant's motion to dismiss, the court admonished that it was sufficient to show that regularly issued process had been used to accomplish an improper purpose in order to set forth a cause of action for abuse of process.\n\nThe fact that the plaintiff had yielded to defendant's threat to have her arrested under the warrant did not diminish the cause of action, because it was clear that the plaintiff actually had been arrested for the purpose of compelling her to pay the cost of the room.\n\n"}

{"id": "14003441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14003441", "title": "Bag-of-words model", "text": "Bag-of-words model\n\nThe bag-of-words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval (IR). In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity. The bag-of-words model has also been used for computer vision.\n\nThe bag-of-words model is commonly used in methods of document classification where the (frequency of) occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier.\n\nAn early reference to \"bag of words\" in a linguistic context can be found in Zellig Harris's 1954 article on \"Distributional Structure\".\n\nThe following models a text document using bag-of-words. Here are two simple text documents:\n(1) John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.\n\n(2) John also likes to watch football games.\nBased on these two text documents, a list constructed as follows for each document:\n\n\"John\",\"likes\",\"to\",\"watch\",\"movies\",\"Mary\",\"likes\",\"movies\",\"too\"\n\n\"John\",\"also\",\"likes\",\"to\",\"watch\",\"football\",\"games\"\nRepresenting each bag-of-words as a JSON object, and attributing to the respective Javascript variable:\n\nBoW1 = {\"John\":1,\"likes\":2,\"to\":1,\"watch\":1,\"movies\":2,\"Mary\":1,\"too\":1};\nBoW2 = {\"John\":1,\"also\":1,\"likes\":1,\"to\":1,\"watch\":1,\"football\":1,\"games\":1};\n\nEach key is the word, and each value is the number of occurrences of that word in the given text document.\n\nThe order of elements is free, so, for example codice_1 is also \"BoW1\". It is also what we expect from a strict \"JSON object\" representation.\n\nNote: if another document is like a union of these two, \n(3) John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too. John also likes to watch football games.\nits Javascript representation will be:\n\nBoW3 = {\"John\":2,\"likes\":3,\"to\":2,\"watch\":2,\"movies\":2,\"Mary\":1,\"too\":1,\"also\":1,\"football\":1,\"games\":1};\nSo, as we see in the bag algebra, the \"union\" of two documents in the bags-of-words representation is, formally, the disjoint union, summing the multiplicities of each element. formula_1.\n\nIn practice, the Bag-of-words model is mainly used as a tool of feature generation. After transforming the text into a \"bag of words\", we can calculate various measures to characterize the text. The most common type of characteristics, or features calculated from the Bag-of-words model is term frequency, namely, the number of times a term appears in the text. For the example above, we can construct the following two lists to record the term frequencies of all the distinct words (BoW1 and BoW2 ordered as in BoW3):\n\n(1) [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n(2) [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nEach entry of the lists refers to the count of the corresponding entry in the list (this is also the histogram representation). For example, in the first list (which represents document 1), the first two entries are \"1,2\":\n\n\nThis list (or vector) representation does not preserve the order of the words in the original sentences. This is just the main feature of the Bag-of-words model. This kind of representation has several successful applications, such as email filtering.\nHowever, term frequencies are not necessarily the best representation for the text. Common words like \"the\", \"a\", \"to\" are almost always the terms with highest frequency in the text. Thus, having a high raw count does not necessarily mean that the corresponding word is more important. To address this problem, one of the most popular ways to \"normalize\" the term frequencies is to weight a term by the inverse of document frequency, or tf–idf. Additionally, for the specific purpose of classification, supervised alternatives have been developed to account for the class label of a document. Lastly, binary (presence/absence or 1/0) weighting is used in place of frequencies for some problems (e.g., this option is implemented in the WEKA machine learning software system).\n\nBag-of-word model is an orderless document representation—only the counts of words mattered. For instance, in the above example \"John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too\", the bag-of-words representation will not reveal that the verb \"likes\" always follows a person's name in this text. As an alternative, the n-gram model can store this spatial information. Applying to the same example above, a bigram model will parse the text into the following units and store the term frequency of each unit as before.\n[\n\nConceptually, we can view bag-of-word model as a special case of the n-gram model, with n=1. For n>1 the model is named w-shingling (where \"w\" is equivalent to \"n\" denoting the number of grouped words). See language model for a more detailed discussion.\n\nA common alternative to using dictionaries is the hashing trick, where words are mapped directly to indices with a hashing function. Thus, no memory is required to store a dictionary. Hash collisions are typically dealt via freed-up memory to increase the number of hash buckets. In practice, hashing simplifies the implementation of bag-of-words models and improves scalability.\n\nIn Bayesian spam filtering, an e-mail message is modeled as an unordered collection of words selected from one of two probability distributions: one representing spam and one representing legitimate e-mail (\"ham\"). \nImagine there are two literal bags full of words. One bag is filled with words found in spam messages, and the other with words found in legitimate e-mail. While any given word is likely to be somewhere in both bags, the \"spam\" bag will contain spam-related words such as \"stock\", \"Viagra\", and \"buy\" significantly more frequently, while the \"ham\" bag will contain more words related to the user's friends or workplace.\n\nTo classify an e-mail message, the Bayesian spam filter assumes that the message is a pile of words that has been poured out randomly from one of the two bags, and uses Bayesian probability to determine which bag it is more likely to be.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17586960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17586960", "title": "Bar stock", "text": "Bar stock\n\nBar stock, also (colloquially) known as blank, slug or billet, is a common form of raw purified metal, used by industry to manufacture metal parts and products. Bar stock is available in a variety of extrusion shapes and lengths. The most common shapes are round (circular cross-section), rectangular, square and hexagonal or hex. A bar is characterised by an \"enclosed invariant convex cross-section\", meaning that pipes, angle stock and objects with varying diameter are not considered bar stock.\n\nBar stock is commonly processed by a sequence of sawing, turning, milling, drilling and grinding to produce a final product, often vastly different from the original stock. In some cases, the process is partially automated by specialized equipment which feeds the stock into the appropriate processing machine.\n\nMost metal produced by a steel mill or aluminium plant is formed (via rolling or extrusion) into long continuous strips of various size and shape. These strips are cut at regular intervals and allowed to cool, each segment becoming a piece of bar stock. A good analogy is pasta-making, in which lumps of dough are extruded into various cross-sectional shapes; cut into lengths; and then dried in that form. The cross-sectional shapes of pasta vary from simple bar or tube shapes (such as linguine or penne) to more elaborate extrusions (such as rotelle, fiori, or rotini). The same is true of metal bar stock. The most common shapes are round bar (also called rod), rectangular bar (including square bar, the special case of equal sides), and hexagonal bar (usually called hex bar for short). Tube and pipe are similar, but have hollow centers and are traditionally not called \"bar\" in industrial usage. (However, a product called hollow bar, essentially tube but with custom-orderable OD and ID and thus custom wall thickness, is marketed for lathe bar work which can benefit from obviation of drilling and rough boring.) Also similar in concept, but not called \"bar\", are the common structural shapes such as angle stock and channel stock. These are commonly available in steel and aluminum; the names \"angle iron\" and \"channel iron\" are still commonly used (informally) even though their literal namesake, wrought iron, has been replaced by steel and aluminum for most uses.\n\nIn a machine shop, bar stock and plate are often called \"billet\", although in a rolling mill, that word refers to a piece of metal that has not yet been rolled into bar.\n\nA machine shop typically has a storage area containing a large variety of bar stock. To create a metal component, a bar of sufficient volume is selected from storage and brought to the machining area. This piece may then be sawed, milled, drilled, turned, or ground to remove material and create the final shape. In turning, for large-diameter work (typically more than , although there is no universal threshold), a piece of the bar is cut off using a horizontal bandsaw to create a \"blank\" for each part. The blanks are then fed into a chucking lathe (chucker) which chucks each one in turn. For smaller-diameter work, the entire length of bar stock is more often fed through the spindle of the lathe. The entire bar rotates with the spindle during the part-machining cycle. When the cycle ends and one part is done, the chuck opens, the bar is pulled or pushed forward (\"fed\") by any of various automatic means, the chuck closes, and the next cycle begins. The last step of the cycle is to cut off the machined part from the bar, which is called \"parting it off\" and is achieved with a \"cutoff\" or \"part-off\" tool, a tool bit that grooves the bar all the way down to the centreline, causing the part to fall off. Then the cycle repeats.\n\nThe not-yet-cut bar protruding from the back of the spindle, rotating quickly, can present a safety hazard if it is sticking out too far and unconstrained from bending. Thus sometimes long bars must be sawn into shorter bars before being fed as \"bar work\" (which is the term for such work).\n\nCNC lathes and screw machines have accessories called \"bar feeders\", which hold, guide, and feed the bar as commanded by the CNC control. More advanced machines may have a \"bar loader\" which holds multiple bars and feeds them one at a time into the bar feeder. Bar loaders are like magazines for part blanks (or pallets for milling work) in that they allow lights-out machining. The bar loader is filled with bars (or the magazine or pallet with part blanks) during working hours, and then it runs during the night unattended. Given that there is no human around to detect if something went wrong and the machine should stop, there are various kinds of sensors that are used to detect this, such as load meters, infrared beams, and, in recent years, webcams, which are placed inside the machine tool's enclosure and allow remote viewing of the cutting action.\n\nTo stock every possible size of bar stock (every possible fraction of a millimetre or inch in diameter or thickness) is impossible. Thus, bar stock is stocked by metals supply houses in various standard sizes, arrayed in discrete steps. For example, round bar with diameters of even millimetres (or in the USA, on the eighths of an inch) can usually be ordered from standing stock. Bar diameters of nonstandard sizes can also be obtained, but only as a separate mill run from the rolling mill. Thus they are much more expensive than the standard sizes, can take much longer delivery time, and are not desirable as inventory for the supply house or the machine shop (because the chance of selling or using any particular custom size is slim).\n\nSometimes it is necessary that the bar not be very much larger than the intended part, because the metallurgical properties of some metal alloys in some finishing processes may vary by how far inside the bar the metal lies. Thus an engineering drawing will specify a certain size (or a maximum size) that the bar may start out as. These specs face the aforementioned limitation of stocking sizes versus custom mill runs; standard sizes are used wherever possible to avoid wasted expense and needless delays.\n\nA drill bit is tool steel round stock ground to a tight tolerance diameter; it is usually ±0.0005 in (±0.0127 mm). In the UK the name \"silver steel\" is often synonymous and sometimes hyponymous. Its origin was in reference to the shiny ground appearance (not to any silver alloying content). Drill rod diameters range from ; in the United States diameters smaller than th of an inch are made in letter drill sizes and number drill sizes, in addition to fractional sizes. Lengths are usually one or three feet (0.3 or 0.9 m). It is commonly used to make drill bits, taps, reamers, punches, dowel pins, and shafts. Note that the numbered sizes are different from the drill numbered sizes starting at 52. These sizes are:\n\nDrill blanks have an undersize tolerance of +0/−0.0002 in, while reamer blanks have an oversize tolerance of −0/+0.0002 in.\n\nSome mills also sell square stock that is held to the same tolerances under the name \"drill rod\".\n\nCommonly available material grades in the U.S. are A2, D2, M2, M42, O1, S7, W1, and high speed steel (including M2/M7).\n\n\"Ground flat stock\" is annealed steel that has been ground to close tolerances (compare to drill rod). There are four types of materials available: O-1 tool steel, A-2 tool steel, A-6 tool steel, and 1018 steel (low-carbon or low-carb steel). Lengths are either long, various widths up to are available, and thicknesses range from .\n\nSome geometrical sizes are known as \"\".\n\n "}

Biomarkers are often measured and evaluated to examine normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers are used in many scientific fields.\n\nIn medicine, a biomarker can be a traceable substance that is introduced into an organism as a means to examine organ function or other aspects of health. For example, rubidium chloride is used as a radioactive isotope to evaluate perfusion of heart muscle.\n\nIt can also be a substance whose detection indicates a particular disease state, for example, the presence of an antibody may indicate an infection. More specifically, a biomarker indicates a change in expression or state of a protein that correlates with the risk or progression of a disease, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment.\n\nOne example of a commonly used biomarker in medicine is prostate-specific antigen (PSA). This marker can be measured as a proxy of prostate size with rapid changes potentially indicating cancer. The most extreme case would be to detect mutant proteins as cancer specific biomarkers through Selected reaction monitoring (SRM), since mutant proteins can only come from an existing tumor, thus providing ultimately the best specificity for medical purposes.\n\nBiomarkers used for personalized medicine are typically categorized as either prognostic or predictive. An example is KRAS, an oncogene that encodes a GTPase involved in several signal transduction pathways. Prognostic biomarkers indicate the likelihood of patient outcome regardless of a specific treatment. Predictive biomarkers are used to help optimize ideal treatments, and indicates the likelihood of benefiting from a specific therapy. Biomarkers for precision oncology are typically utilized in the molecular diagnostics of chronic myeloid leukemia, colon, breast, and lung cancer, and in melanoma.\n\nProof of concept\n\nPreviously used to identify the specific characteristics of the biomarker, this step is essential for doing an \"in situ\" validation of these benefits. A large number of candidates must be tested to select the most relevant ones.\n\nExperimental validation\n\nThis step allows the development of the most adapted protocol for routine use of the biomarker. Simultaneously, it is possible to confirm the relevance of the protocol with various methods (histology, PCR, ELISA, ...) and to define strata based on the results.\n\nAnalytical performances validation\n\nOne of the most important steps, it serves to identify specific characteristics of the candidate biomarker before developing a routine test. Several parameters are considered including:\n\n\nProtocol standardization\n\nThis optimizes the validated protocol for routine use, including analysis of the critical points by scanning the entire procedure to identify and control the potential risks.\n\nIn cell biology, a biomarker is a molecule that allows the detection and isolation of a particular cell type (for example, the protein Oct-4 is used as a biomarker to identify embryonic stem cells).\n\nIn genetics, a biomarker (identified as genetic marker) is a DNA sequence that causes disease or is associated with susceptibility to disease. They can be used to create genetic maps of whatever organism is being studied.\n\nA biomarker can be any kind of molecule indicating the existence, past or present, of living organisms. In the fields of geology and astrobiology, biomarkers, versus geomarkers, are also known as biosignatures. The term biomarker is also used to describe biological involvement in the generation of petroleum.\n\nBiomarkers are used to indicate an exposure to or the effect of xenobiotics which are present in the environment and in organisms. The biomarker may be an external substance itself (e.g. asbestos particles or NNK from tobacco), or a variant of the external substance processed by the body (a metabolite) that usually can be quantified.\n\nThe widespread use of the term \"biomarker\" dates back to as early as 1980. The term \"biological marker\" was introduced in 1950s. In 1998, the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Definitions Working Group defined a biomarker as \"a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.\"\n"}

{"id": "1704531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1704531", "title": "Carlos Drummond de Andrade", "text": "Carlos Drummond de Andrade\n\nCarlos Drummond de Andrade (October 31, 1902 – August 17, 1987) was a Brazilian poet and writer, considered by some as the greatest Brazilian poet of all time. He has become something of a national cultural symbol in Brazil, where his widely influential poem \"Canção Amiga\" (\"Friendly Song\") has been featured on the 50-cruzado novo bill.\n\nDrummond was born in Itabira, a mining village in Minas Gerais in the southeastern region of Brazil. His parents were farmers belonging to old Brazilian families of mainly Portuguese origin. He went to a school of pharmacy in Belo Horizonte, but never worked as a pharmacist after graduation, as he did not enjoy the career he chose. He worked as a civil servant for most of his life, eventually becoming director of history for the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Service of Brazil. \nThough his earliest poems are formal and satirical, Drummond quickly adopted the new forms of Brazilian modernism that were evolving in the 1920s, incited by the work of Mário de Andrade (to whom he was not related). He would mingle speech fluent in elegance and derive truth about his surroundings, many times describing quotidian, normal aspects of life while achieving a fluidity of thought and speech. Drummond drifted towards communism at the start of World War II and took up the editorship of the Brazilian Communist Party's official newspaper, \"Tribuna Popular\", but later abandoned the post due to disagreements over censorship, which Drummond staunchly opposed.\n\nThe work of Carlos Drummond is generally divided into several segments, which appear very markedly in each of his books. But this is somewhat misleading, since even in the midst of his \"everyday\" poems or his \"socialist,\" politicized poems, there appear creations which can be easily incorporated into his later \"metaphysical\" canon, and none of these \"styles\" is completely free of the others. There is surely much \"metaphysical\" content in even his most political poems.\n\nThe most prominent of these later metaphysical poems is \"A Máquina do Mundo\" (The World's Machine). The poem deals with an anti-Faust referred to in the first person, who receives the visit of the aforementioned Machine, which stands for all possible knowledge, and the sum of the answers for all the questions which afflict men; in highly dramatic and baroque versification the poem develops only for the anonymous subject to decline the offer of endless knowledge and proceed his gloomy path in the solitary road. It takes the renaissance allegory of the Machine of the World from Portugal's most esteemed poet, Luís de Camões, more precisely, from a canto at the end of his epic masterpiece \"Os Lusíadas.\"\n\nOne of those said segments have been found only after his death: deliberately erotic poetry. That type of poetry has been published in only one book \"Moça deitada na grama\" (woman laid down in the grass) with the authorization and actual intervention by his son-in-law.\nDrummond is a favorite of American poets, a number of whom, including Mark Strand and Lloyd Schwartz, have translated his work. Later writers and critics have sometimes credited his relationship with Elizabeth Bishop, his first English language translator, as influential for his American reception, but though she admired him Bishop claimed she barely even knew him. In an interview with George Starbuck in 1977, she said, \"I didn't know him at all. He's supposed to be very shy. I'm supposed to be very shy. We've met once — on the sidewalk at night. We had just come out of the same restaurant, and he kissed my hand politely when we were introduced.\"\n\nDrummond, as a writer of the modernist style, follows the writing mechanic proposed by Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade; making use of free verse, and not depending on a fixed meter. In modernism, the predominant style which Drummond wrote in, styles were divided into lyrical and subjective or objective and concrete, Drummond would be part of the latter, similar to Oswald de Andrade. \n\nDrummond was the first great poet to assert himself after the premiere modernist of Brazil and created a unique style dominated by his beautiful writing. His work displays linguistic freedom and free verse. But it goes beyond that: \"The work of Drummond reaches – as Fernando Pessoa, Jorge de Lima, Murilo Mendes and Herberto Helder – a coefficient of loneliness that detached from the soil of history, leading the reader to an attitude free of references, trademarks or ideological or prospective,\" said Alfredo Bosi (1994). \n\nHis poetry, according to Affonso Romano de Sant'Anna, can be divided into three parts, :\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, his poetry began to become more erotic. \"O Amor Natural\" (\"Natural Love\"), a collection of erotic poems, was published posthumously.\n\n\nEnglish\n\nPortuguese\n\nSpanish\n\n"}

Clipping is also known as \"truncation\" or \"shortening\".\n\nAccording to Marchand (1969), clippings are not coined as words belonging to the standard vocabulary of a language. They originate as terms of a special group like schools, army, police, the medical profession, etc., in the intimacy of a milieu where a hint is sufficient to indicate the whole. For example, \"exam\"(ination), \"math\"(ematics), and \"lab\"(oratory) originated in school slang; \"spec\"(ulation) and \"tick\"(et = credit) in stock-exchange slang; and \"vet\"(eran) and \"cap\"(tain) in army slang. Clipped forms can pass into common usage when they are widely useful, becoming part of standard English, which most speakers would agree has happened with \"math\"/\"maths\", \"lab\", \"exam\", \"phone\" (from \"telephone\"), \"fridge\" (from \"refrigerator\"), and various others. When their usefulness is limited to narrower contexts, such as with \"tick\" in stock-exchange slang, they remain outside standard register. Many, such as \"mani\" and \"pedi\" for \"manicure\" and \"pedicure\" or \"mic\"/\"mike\" for \"microphone\", occupy a middle ground in which their appropriate register is a subjective judgment, but succeeding decades tend to see them become more widely used.\n\nClipping is different from back-formation – back-formation may change the part of speech or the word's meaning, whereas clipping creates shortened words from longer words, but does \"not\" change the part of speech or the meaning of the word.\n\nAccording to (1986), clipping mainly consists of the following types:\n\nFinal (or back) clipping is the most common type, in which the beginning of the prototype is retained. The unclipped original may be either a simple or a composite. Examples are: \"ad\" (advertisement), \"cable\" (cablegram), \"doc\" (doctor), \"exam\" (examination), \"fax\" (facsimile), \"gas\" (gasoline), \"gym\" (gymnastics, gymnasium), \"memo\" (memorandum), \"mutt\" (muttonhead), \"pub\" (public house), \"pop\" (popular music).\n\nInitial (or fore) clipping retains the final part of the prototype. Examples: \"bot\" (robot), \"chute\" (parachute), \"roach\" (cockroach), \"coon\" (raccoon), \"gator\" (alligator), \"phone\" (telephone), \"pike\" (turnpike), \"varsity\" (university), \"net\" (Internet).\n\nFinal and initial clipping may be combined and result in curtailed words with the middle part of the prototype retained, which is the stressed syllable. Examples: \"flu\" (influenza), \"frig\" or \"fridge\" (refrigerator), \"jams\" or \"jammies\" (pajamas/pyjamas), \"polly\" (apollinaris), \"shrink\" (head-shrinker), \"tec\" (detective).\n\nWords with the middle part of the word left out are equally few. They may be further subdivided into two groups: (a) words with a final-clipped stem retaining the functional morpheme: \"maths\" (mathematics), \"specs\" (spectacles); (b) contractions due to a gradual process of elision under the influence of rhythm and context. Thus, \"fancy\" (fantasy), \"ma'am\" (madam), and fo'c'sle may be regarded as accelerated forms.\n\nClipped forms are also used in compounds. One part of the original compound most often remains intact. Examples are: \"cablegram\" (\"cable\" tele\"gram\"), \"op art\" (\"op\"tical \"art\"), \"org-man\" (\"org\"anization \"man\"), \"linocut\" (\"lino\"leum \"cut\"). Sometimes both halves of a compound are clipped as in \"navicert\" (\"navi\"gation \"cert\"ificate). In these cases it is difficult to know whether the resultant formation should be treated as a clipping or as a blend, for the border between the two types is not always clear. According to Bauer (1983), the easiest way to draw the distinction is to say that those forms which retain compound stress are clipped compounds, whereas those that take simple word stress are not. By this criterion \"bodbiz, Chicom, Comsymp, Intelsat, midcult, pro\"-\"am, photo op, sci-fi\", and \"sitcom\" are all compounds made of clippings.\n"}

Its aim is to encourage language learning across Europe.\n\nThe general objectives of the European Day of Languages are to:\n\nIn keeping with these rules, people, young and old, are encouraged to take up a language, or take special pride in their existing language skills. Also, those responsible for providing access to language learning are encouraged to make it easier for people to learn a range of languages, and to support policy initiatives to promote languages. There is also emphasis on learning a language other than English.\n\nOn the occasion of the day, a range of events are organised across Europe, including those for children, television and radio programmes, language classes and conferences. The events are not organised by the Council of Europe or the European Union nor do they allocate special funding (i.e. apart from their existing language programmes) for the day. Member states and potential partners are given a free hand to organise activities. To coordinate the activities organised at national level, the Council of Europe asks participating countries to nominate \"National Relay Persons\" for the day. The national relay in the UK used to be CILT, the National Centre for Languages.\n\nThere are about 225 indigenous languages in Europe – roughly 3% of the world's total. Most of the European languages are of Indo-European origin. Since the end of the 18th century, the most widespread language of Europe (both in terms of geography and the number of native speakers) has been Russian, which replaced French. Counting only native speakers, approximately 150 million Europeans speak Russian on a daily basis, followed by German (approx. 95 mil.), English and French (each by 65 mil.), Italian (60 mil.), Spanish and Polish (40 mil. each), Ukrainian (30 mil.) and Romanian (26 mil.). As far as foreign language studies are concerned, English is currently the most popular foreign language in Europe, followed by German, French, Italian, Russian and Spanish\n\nAccording to the European Union survey \"Europeans and their Languages\" (\"Special Eurobarometer 243\", February 2006), 56% of EU citizens (25 member states) speak a language other than their mother tongue, but 44% admit to not knowing any languages other than their native language. However, 28% have knowledge of two foreign languages. Among EU citizens, 38% indicate that they know English, followed by 14% knowing French or German, 7% Russian, 5% Spanish and 3% Italian. The typical multilingual European is a student or someone holding a managerial position or someone born in a country where the language of his/her parents is different from the main language of the country.\n\nWith greater numbers of immigrants and refugees, European cities have become more multilingual. For example: in Moscow and Saint Petersburg many recent immigrants speak Ukrainian, Romanian, Armenian, Tatar, Azeri, Tajik, Chinese or one of many other languages; in London some 300 languages are spoken (English, French, Chinese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Bengali, Turkish, Kurdish, Berber, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi etc.).\n\nThe European Union adheres to a policy of multilingualism, both in its institutional workings and as an aim for its citizens. At the 2002 EU summit in Barcelona, it set a target for children to learn at least two foreign languages from an early age. Multilingualism for the EU is linked to worker mobility and the European economy. The European Union spends more than €30 million a year promoting language learning and linguistic diversity through the \"Socrates\" and \"Leonardo da Vinci\" programmes, a policy that began with the pioneering \"Lingua programme\" in 1990.\n\n\n"}

FCG is an open instrument that can be used by construction grammarians who want to formulate their intuitions and data in a precise way and who want to test the implications of their grammar designs for language parsing, production and learning. The formalism can be tested through an interactive web interface at the FCG website.\n\nFCG integrates many notions from contemporary computational linguistics such as feature structure and unification-based language processing, but uses them in a novel way to operationalize insights from construction grammar theory. Constructions are considered bi-directional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that FCG provides meta-layer processing for coping with novelty, partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is primarily carried out by Luc Steels and his teams at the VUB AI Lab in Brussels and the Language Evolution Lab in Barcelona, and the Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Paris. Besides Steels, current and former contributors to the FCG formalism include Katrien Beuls, Paul Van Eecke, Remi van Trijp, Joris Bleys, Joachim De Beule, Martin Loetzsch, Nicolas Neubauer, Michael Spranger, Wouter Van den Broeck, Pieter Wellens, and others.\n\nFCG treats parsing and production as a search problem, in which the FCG engine searches for the best utterance to verbalize a meaning (language production) or the best semantic network (or meaning representation) to analyze an utterance (parsing). Each state representation in the search process is called a Transient Structure. A Transient Structure can be considered as an extended feature structure, as it consists of a (flat) list of \"units\" that consist of a unit-name (a unique constant symbol) and a unit-body (a set of feature-value pairs). Older versions of FCG (before 2011) used to split the transient structure into two separate poles for semantics and syntax, but the current version implements a single representation for all linguistic information.\n\nFCG constructions (or technically speaking: construction schemas) are treated as the operators of the search process. That is, by applying a construction to a transient structure, a new transient structure (or state representation) in the search space may be created. Just like transient structures, constructions mostly consists of units of feature-value pairs. Constructions are however more structured because they contain two distinct parts:\n\nTo decide whether a construction can apply, the conditional part is \"matched\" against the current transient structure using a unification-based algorithm. In production, only features that are part of the formulation locks of the construction must be matched against the transient structure; whereas in parsing, only features that are part of the comprehension locks will be considered. If a match is successful, the FCG engine will \"merge\" all of the units of feature-value pairs with the transient structure in a similar unification-based process.\n\nFCG features a meta-layers of diagnostics, repairs and consolidation strategies that allow the grammar designer to implement ways to handle novelty, errors and unexpected input during processing. These diagnostics and repairs can also be used for exploring the (automated) acquisition of new constructions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "507070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507070", "title": "Head voice", "text": "Head voice\n\nIn vocal music, the head voice, depending on vocal pedagogy, is a particular part of the vocal range, or type of vocal register, or a vocal resonance area.\n\nThe term goes back at least as far as the Roman tradition of rhetorical instruction. Quintilian (ca. AD 95) recommends teaching students \"ut quotiens exclamandum erit lateris conatus sit ille, non capitis\" (\"that when the voice has to be raised the effort comes from the lungs and not from the head,\" \"Inst.\" 1.11.8, transl. Russell). The first recorded mention of the term in a musical context was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the throat and the chest voice (pectoris, guttoris, capitis — at this time it is likely head voice referred to the falsetto register) by the writers Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia. The term was later adopted within bel canto, the Italian opera singing method, where it was identified as the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, passagio and head registers. This approach is still taught by some vocal pedagogists today.\n\nHowever, as knowledge of human physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists have redefined or even abandoned the use of the term head voice. In particular, the use of the term head register has become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the head. The vibratory sensations that are felt in the head are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the term \"head voice\" over the term \"head register.\" These vocal pedagogists also hold that many of the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the controversy over this terminology. Also, the term head register is not used within speech pathology and is not one of the four main vocal registers identified by speech pathologists.\nThe following is an overview of the two predominant views on head voice within vocal pedagogy.\n\nOne prevailing practice within vocal pedagogy is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into \"chest register\", \"head register\", and \"falsetto register\" and women's voices into \"chest register\", \"middle register\", and \"head register\". According to this practice, singing in the head register feels to the singer as if the tone is resonating in his or her head (rather than primarily in the chest or throat). According to an early 20th-century book written by David Clippinger, all voices have a head register, whether bass or soprano.\n\nClippinger claims that males and females switch registers at the same absolute pitches. He also states that at about E flat or E above middle C the tenor passes from what is usually called open to covered tone, but which might better be called from chest to head voice. At the same absolute pitches the alto or soprano passes from the chest to the middle register. According to Clippinger there is every reason to believe that the change in the mechanism for male voices into head register is the same as that which occurs in the female voice as it goes into the middle register at the same pitches.\n\nThe contemporary vocal pedagogy instructor Bill Martin seconds the view that the change from chest voice to head voice occurs at around E4 in all voices, including the bass, but Martin states in the coloratura soprano it is more likely to occur at F4. A recent book by a former teacher at Oberlin College Conservatory of Music and a vocal pedagogy teacher, Richard Miller, states that in the \"tenore lirico\" the higher part of the singing voice above the secondo passaggio at G4 extending upwards is referred to as \"full voice in head,\" or \"voce piena in testa\", effectively stating the head register begins at G4 in the \"tenore lirico,\" not at E4. According to Singing For Dummies, the bass changes from chest voice into middle voice around A3 or A3 below Middle C and changes into his head voice around D4 or C4 above Middle C.\n\nIn the head register (which is above the chest register), some of the bottom end leaves the voice, but it's still, according to Martin, a voice capable of much power.\n\nExplanations for the physiological mechanisms behind the head voice can alter from voice teacher to voice teacher. This is because, according to Clippinger, \"In discussing the head voice it is the purpose to avoid as much as possible the mechanical construction of the instrument\".\n\nHowever, not all vocal teachers agree with this view. Thomas Appell's 1993 book \"Can You Sing a HIGH C Without Straining?\" aimed to refute the theory that all singers switch registers at the same absolute pitch. Appell defined chest voice as resonance below the vocal folds and head voice as resonance above the vocal folds. He recorded examples of male and female singers changing from chest voice to head voice at different pitches in an attempt to prove that the transition pitch is a function of the intensity of the vocal tone and is not absolute. At higher vocal cord tension (intensity of singing), Appell shows that the pitch at which a singer transitions from chest to head voice will be higher. At lower vocal cord tension (intensity of singing), Appell shows that the pitch at which a singer transitions from chest to head voice will be lower.\n\nThis view is that since all registers originate in laryngeal function, it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the head. The vibratory sensations which are felt in the head are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the term \"head voice\" over the term register and divide the human voice into four registers: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is more consistent with modern understandings of human physiology and in keeping with stroboscope videos of laryngeal function during vocal phonation.\nTarneaud says, \"during singing, the vibration of the vocal folds impresses periodic shakes on the laryngeal cartilage which transmits them to the bones in the thorax via the laryngeal depressors, and to the bony structures in the head via the laryngeal elevators. Singers feel these shakes in the form of thoracic and facial vibrations\". These internal phonatory sensations produced by laryngeal vibrations are called \"resonance\" by singers and teachers of singing.\nThere are seven parts of the human body that act as resonators and of those seven the three most effective resonators that help amplify and create the most pleasing sounds are all located in the head: the pharynx, the oral cavity, and the nasal cavity.\n\nResonances and registration aside, the term \"head voice\" is commonly used to mean \"high notes that are not falsetto or strained\". For example, when Pavarotti, Stevie Wonder or Bill Withers slide from chest voice to a high C5 in full, balanced voice, this is referred to as \"head voice\".\n\nBeginning singers who have difficulty controlling their vocal break need to be taught to eliminate or control the physiological conditions associated with falsetto or strain in a process called \"head voice.\" A strong falsetto is called a reinforced falsetto and a very light head voice is called voce di testa bianca or 'white head voice.'\n\nHigh notes that are sung with balanced physiology do tend to have better resonance than falsetto or strained notes, so this definition does not usually contradict the other two.\n\n"}

Jedek speakers describe themselves as ethnic Menriq or Batek to outsiders, but their language, although very closely related, is distinct from all other Aslian languages.\n\nJedek speakers have no autonym (endonym). Nearby Aslian speakers, particular the Jahai and Menriq, refer to them as the \"Jdɛk\" [ɟᶽəˈdɛk˺].\n\nJedek is spoken by about 280 people in Sungai Rual, located on the Rual River just south of the town of Jeli in Jeli District, Kelantan state, northern Peninsular Malaysia. In the 1970s, the Malaysian government sponsored the resettlement of several bands of former foragers, both Jahai and Jedek speakers who roamed the middle reaches of the Pergau River, to the Sungai Rual area. Today, the area comprises around three main hamlets and is inhabited by around seven bands, of which three are primarily Jahai-speaking, and the other four were primarily \"Menriq/Batek\", most probably Jedek.\n\nThe low number of Jedek speakers could lead it to being considered endangered, but several factors are ensuring intergenerational transmission of the language is not interrupted. Traditionally, Semang communities were highly nomadic and were accustomed to the breakup of groups to suit the particular conditions they were experiencing. The Semang also practice band exogamy, meaning that marriage between speakers of different languages is quite common. Due to frequent contact with surrounding communities, Semang are typically fluent in multiple Aslian languages, and sometimes an adjacent majority language like Malay or Thai. In addition, due to the settlement of multiple bands together, it is common for people born in Rual to marry others from Rual, leading to the intense amount of intermarriage between speakers of Jahai and Jedek, while it is also common for people to relocate to or from Rual for marriage due to the small pool of available adults, most commonly speakers of closely related languages like Jahai or Batek. In addition, the Semang have a strong tradition of maintaining their unique cultural and linguistic identity while undergoing constant contact and social change, so Jedek speakers are accustomed to transmitting their language to children in similar environments. The speaker population of Jedek has grown since the 1970s, and Jedek is used in all environments by speakers of all age groups. Living in such a multilingual environment means that the majority of Rual residents can speak or understand Jedek. \n\nHowever, this sustained contact with other Aslian languages means Jedek is undergoing changes in morphology, grammar and structure. In addition, getting a paid job invariably means knowing the national language Malay, which surrounds the Aslian speech area. And although Jedek speakers have a positive attitude towards their language, the language is unrecognized by the Malaysian government, which regards the settlement area as Jahai-speaking. So far there has been very little language development, apart from some linguists attempting to create a Malay-based orthography for the language.\n\nJedek has 9 vowels. All vowels have nasal equivalents, and Jedek demonstrates contrastive nasalization.\nJedek demonstrates a typical Jahaic consonant inventory.\n\nThe voiceless bilabial fricative /ɸ/ is a marginal consonant that occurs only in word-final position\n\nNasals are prestopped in word-final position when preceded by an oral vowel. Nasal consonants also cause progressive nasalization of vowels.\n\nThe rhotic consonant varies in pronunciation from the alveolar trill /r/ to the voiced uvular fricative /ʁ/. How the speaker pronounces it is dependent partially on the speaker's age: younger speakers are more likely to pronounce it closer to /r/ while older speakers are more likely to have a pronunciation closer to /ʁ/.\n"}

Disabled since early life, and unable to speak, he is the first standup comedian in Britain to use a communication aid in his routines, performing them under the stage name of Lost Voice Guy. He rose to prominence in June 2018 after winning the 12th series of \"Britain's Got Talent\".\n\nRidley was originally from Consett, County Durham. At the age of six months he was diagnosed with a neurological form of cerebral palsy, brought about by a brain infection that left him in a coma for two months, which affected his movement and rendered him unable to speak. His disability in early life made it difficult to communicate with people, until the age of eight when he received his first communication device, while his education at a school for disabled children was aided by supportive teachers. Between 1999 – 2002, he studied journalism and online journalism at the University of Central Lancashire, achieving an undergraduate degree in the former, and a Masters Degree in the latter. In 2006, he worked as a journalist with the BBC and local newspapers, before taking on the role of online content manager for the city of Sunderland in 2007.\n\nRidley began performing comedy in 2012, having grown up with a love for it, including standup performances. His decision to perform standup himself came in the aftermath of a gig conducted by Ross Noble, in which Ridley encountered the comedian and challenged him on the quality of Noble's impersonation of Stephen Hawking, claiming he could do a far better impersonation of the renowned physicist. To formulate his routines, Ridley purchased an iPad voice synthesizer app called Speak It!, which he pre-programmed with sentences based on material he created. Following his first show, Ridley adapted his routine by selecting material that had received favourable audience reaction, and adopting a style of improvisation in which he occasionally created new material onstage through his synthesizer in real-time. His first successful show was at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2013, although he was forced to cut this short after he developed pneumonia.\n\nIn 2014, Ridley won the BBC Radio New Comedy Awards, and by 2015, he began to pursue a professional comedy career, performing a new show entitled \"Disability for Dunces\", as part of the Edinburgh Fringe that year. The following year, he performed a sequel of the show, entitled \"Volume 2\", and in 2017, launched a new show entitled \"Inspiration Porn\", which made fun of \"inspirational\" videos and memes about disability. After winning the award, he was contacted by The Sequal Trust, who asked him to come on board as a patron of their communication disability charity, a title he still holds today. \n\nIn 2018, Ridley took a starring role on Radio 4 sitcom \"Ability\", which he co-wrote with Sony-nominated writer and comedian Katherine Jakeways. His role involved him playing as the disabled 'Matt', who moves out from his parents' home to share with his best friend from school, who refreshingly treats him as an equal but is not the influence Matt's concerned parents are looking for. In June 2018, Ridley won the 12th series of \"Britain's Got Talent\" after successfully making it through the audition stages, and winning the show by the public vote.\n\n"}

{"id": "24651272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24651272", "title": "MOGUL framework", "text": "MOGUL framework\n\nThe MOGUL framework is a research framework aiming to provide a theoretical perspective on the nature of language. MOGUL (Modular On-line Growth and Use of Language) draws on the common ground underlying various related areas of cognitive science including psycholinguistics, theoretical linguistics, first- and second-language acquisition, neurolinguistics and cognitive psychology; it is designed to be applicable to all these fields of research.\n\nThe MOGUL framework's background assumption is that the mind is composed of expert systems which have evolved over time, one of which is responsible for human linguistic ability. Historically, scientific studies of language have been divided between many sub-disciplines; theoretical linguists focus on the abstract properties of language and researchers in other fields investigate how language is used and processed in real time: either in psychological terms or (in the case of neurolinguistics) through a study of the physical systems of neurons in the brain. Each field of study has developed its own research traditions and technical vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate insights across disciplines. The MOGUL Framework represents an attempt to identify common themes and compatible approaches in different (but related fields), and hence to facilitate integration.\n\nMOGUL is designed as a platform for the generation of new hypotheses, with a terminology and a set of interrelated concepts that can be used across more than one discipline. Although not a full-fledged theory in its own right, it sets out various theoretical claims based on the current literature in a range of research domains. As suggested below it is not connectionist in the most widely used sense of that term, although it employs terms and concepts familiar to connectionists such as competition, activation, activation levels and so forth. The same processing perspective also requires the long-established Chomskyan distinction between competence and performance to be viewed in a somewhat different way. Linguistic competence (knowledge) is not compartmentalised and placed in a separate box in the model, which then forms the object for a processor (or processors) to act on. Rather, it is instantiated and implicit within the processing system. The distinction between mental representation and processing is still valid, but is expressed in a way that ought to allow the abstract properties of linguistic systems in the mind to be more easily investigated in conjunction with real-time linguistic phenomena. The inspiration for this approach is the work of Ray Jackendoff. Here the architecture of the language faculty is formulated in such a way as to facilitate statements about competence-related, representational issues and their relationship to real-time language processing within the same model.\n\nEmpirical evidence for the claims and assumptions set out in MOGUL rests essentially on the experimental findings of the various fields of research on which it is based. The MOGUL framework queries current solutions and raises new questions based upon this body of evidence, in the hope that answers to such questions will be sought in the related areas by appropriate researchers.\n\nMore specifically, MOGUL represents an attempt to provide ways of investigating how first- or second-language processing relates to linguistic development and how language in the monolingual and multilingual language user is situated within human cognitive architecture in general. What exactly happens, even in milliseconds, when someone is exposed to the sights and sounds of a new language? How do we explain what gets noticed and what gets regularly ignored? What about the fixed stages that people seem to pass though? How is it that we have so little conscious control over what we are attempting to acquire? Why do children appear to be worse language learners in the short run and much better in the long run? How can two or more language systems cohabit in one mind? Answers to these questions require an interdisciplinary approach. Two major sources for inspiration for the approach described here are the ideas of generative linguist Ray Jackendoff on language faculty and modularity and Global Workspace Theory, as advanced by Bernard Baars. The first MOGUL publication was released in 2004 and was a keynote article in \"Bilingualism: Language and Cognition\" (Truscott and Sharwood Smith 2004).\n\nIn order to situate languages within a wider cognitive context, the MOGUL framework is designed to provide a basic architecture that purports to explain how (in general terms) the mind functions. This means that it is not an account of brain function, although it is set out in such a way that might facilitate such accounts.\n\nBriefly, MOGUL architecture follows Jackendoff in positing a generic cognitive module (or, in MOGUL, a processing unit) which consists of an integrative processor operating on structural elements (structures) in a memory store. Specifically, it works with activated elements that are raised into working memory from that memory store.\n\nModules are only somewhat generic in structure; the rest is very specific to each module, since each module operates with its own code. Visual memory contains elements that only the visual processor can access; syntactic memory contains elements that only the syntactic processor can deal with, and so on. While Jackendoff prefers to think of working memory as a separate blackboard onto which elements of long-term memory are written, in MOGUL the alternative view of the working-memory blackboard is adopted: it is part of the unified memory system, and elements are raised to the working memory \"surface\" within the same store. In both versions, elements must cross an activation threshold to be visible to the integrative processor.) Note that memory is modularised, so visual memory (including visual working memory) is separate from – and independent of – for example, phonological memory. Modules, useless if entirely autonomous and cut off from other parts of the system as a whole, require some way whereby they can link up and cooperate. This is done by means of interface processors matching structural elements in the memory stores of adjacent modules. The cognitive system as a whole copes with a multitude of different tasks like tying a knot, listening to a speech, driving through a busy city and salsa-dancing by forming appropriate coalitions of processors producing assemblies of structures (linked together via appropriate interfaces) from different modules. The generic structure of a MOGUL module (based on Jackendoff's model) is portrayed in the figure on the right, and also reflected in various places in the third figure in this article (see \"MOGUL architecture in a nutshell\" below).\n\nThis functional architecture may be neurally and anatomically instantiated in different ways: the design of systems such as that proposed by Jackendoff and others (including MOGUL) involves no specific claims about the precise nature and location of the neural system. These are two different levels of description. The auditory module (translated into cortical terms) involves several brain regions distributed across the supratemporal plane; activation in MOGUL terms (when translated into neurological terms) may involve both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. By the same token, functional auditory structure (as described within the MOGUL framework) must be distinguished from anatomical and physiological auditory structure.\n\nAn important portion of the MOGUL account is devoted to the claim that the acquired (and atrophied, or lost) linguistic structures are natural byproducts of online processing. This means that acquisitional mechanisms do not exist as such, but are embodied in the operations of the parser. This claim is made explicit in Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT). Processing concepts (activation levels, competition and so on), as exploited by other non-modular, domain-specific approaches, are realigned in MOGUL to explain how new cognitive systems emerge. APT is a hypothesis put forward by Sharwood Smith and Truscott as an integral part of MOGUL and is applicable to all kinds of cognitive development, not only language acquisition and language attrition (for a similar approach acquisition which is framed within an emergentist perspective, see O'Grady 2005).\n\nEssentially, the claim is that all development is the lingering effect of processing. As the mind attempts to build mental representations online, various structures at its disposal are activated. Structures compete with one another to be selected for the current representation. As a simple example, on hearing the word \"ship\" an English speaker's processing system will activate various candidate structures so (for instance) the phonological structures underlying \"sheep\" and \"shape\" will compete for selection (and other candidates as well, including phonological structures belonging to other languages known to the listener). The \"ship\" structure is normally selected as the best fit, and thereby its likelihood of being selected in the future is correspondingly strengthened by a small amount. In this way, a basic \"use it or lose it\" principle is invoked; this development principle works throughout the cognitive system as a whole.\n\nAs we match various types of cognitive structure available to us in order to find the best fit for unfamiliar input from the environment new connections are developed, initially with the relevant structures possessing a low resting level of activation. This means they will have a relatively poor chance of selection for future instances of the same input. However, the more they are selected the more they will show up in the observable behaviour of the individual concerned.\n\nAlthough the frequency in which we experience given phenomena influences our development, cognitive growth is not an automatic consequence of experience; our mind is modular, and each module is controlled by its own unique processing principles. This limits, for instance, what we can learn to see or hear or say; seeing, hearing and speaking each involve dedicated processing units, which control their own internal operations. In this way, high-frequency events in the environment may still not impact development because the relevant parts of our mind are incapable of processing them. This may be because a) the relevant modules (processing units) are simply not designed to do so, or b) they are not yet ready to process them, because their internal principles require some prerequisite state of affairs before the potential new input can be integrated. By the same token, an internal operation may be halted because although one processing unit has processed input, an adjacent processing unit (module) with which it is connected is not in a ready state to cooperate (find matching structures within its own memory store). Hence frequent events in the external environment may indeed get processed by some part(s) of the cognitive system but still not by every relevant part. MOGUL espouses both modularity of mind and a constrained form of connectionism with a complex web of expert systems, each with its own particular organising principles. In this way, MOGUL makes claims not only about language abilities but about the mind in general.\n\nThe core modules involved in language comprehension work in two directions. Phonological, syntactic and conceptual processing work in one direction in response to visual and auditory events in the environment (typically in listening to speech or reading a text), but they also work in the other direction to produce speech or writing (or messages in sign language). Production involves a physical response to internal events, the creation of a message to be conveyed. This requires articulation of different parts of the body, following the commands of motor structures. Meanings in the conceptual processor are matched with syntactic structures which in turn are matched with phonological structures; this structural chain continues to be built following different routes according to the selected mode of articulation. The required motor structures that drive the articulation of speech will be different from those involved in writing or signing.\n\nWhen the basic direction of processing is, say, from conceptual structure to speech, the assembling of an appropriate structural chain is not carried out in a rigid unidirectional sequence; at different levels, different options will be available and compete for selection. In production, some options may be partially formed and then be dropped in favour of a better-fitting rival structure. In this way the ultimate structural chain is built up incrementally, out of the more accessible candidate structures that happen to provide the best overall fit at the time. Comprehension works according to the same principles, with parallel processing and split-second editing and revising until a best-fit interpretation is arrived at. It may be the wrong interpretation but it will be the best fit, given the person's current processing resources at that particular moment in time.\n\nAs an example of what processing online means, let us examine speech production in a fluent speaker. The construction of a message will be initiated in the conceptual processor. Conceptual structures will be chosen, which then activate the interface between the conceptual and syntactic system. The conceptual structures are matched up with particular syntactic structures forming the first stage – in other words, a CS+SS (conceptual structure plus syntactic structure) chain. A semantic argument structure in CS code which specifies an action with an agent (the doer) and a patient (what is acted upon), as in \"a boy hit the ball\", is matched up with a syntactic argument structure with the requisite verb and noun phrases (determiner phrases), each in the appropriate case: one in nominative case and the other in objective case. The interface between SS and PS kicks in, causing various appropriate phonological structures to be activated; an SS/PS match is made, the outcome now being a CS+SS+PS chain. As is generally the case, more than one option may be selected in parallel before one particular option is settled on. Structural chains are formed incrementally; as more CS is built so more SS and PS are constructed with more context, earlier options that were provisionally selected are dropped as the representation develops and becomes more complex. The PS is matched up with motor structures responsible for the articulation of speech, and the utterance is produced. Each type of structure (AS, PS, SS, CS and so on) is constructed in its own particular module and by its own unique integrative processor, following its own particular set of principles. Comprehension is a similar process, with the general direction going in reverse; auditory structures are formed in response to acoustic stimuli in the environment. These auditory structures match PS and SS, finally culminating in the interpretation of the message (its conceptual structure).\n\nOne feature of the MOGUL approach is an attempt to spell out in coherent terms the role of perception and affect in issues of language development in the individual. In the earlier example of \"a boy hit the ball\" (where a simple example of a how a CS+SS+PS chain was built up), we assume that the conceptual structures evoked also have interfaces with various perceptual and affective structures to account for the associations individuals have with, for example, the concept \"boy\". In other words, the activation of a chain effectively becomes the activation of a whole network of associations contributed by different modular systems in the mind. The co-activation of structural networks of various kinds is important in explaining facts about attention and noticing. MOGUL follows the view that high levels of activation are strongly implicated in the phenomenon of conscious awareness. This is made explicit in the role of \"perceptual output structures\" (POpS).\n\nPOpS is a generic term covering the output of various perceptual systems corresponding to the five senses – or, more properly, the sensory systems currently believed to exist (which number more than the traditional five). Of greatest interest in MOGUL are \"visual structures\" (VS) and \"auditory structures\" (AS), given the fact that language is usually perceived in visual and auditory terms. Structures reside in the memory stores of the appropriate processing system (processing unit, or module). Exposed to the sound of the word \"dog\" or the sound of a creaking door, the auditory system activates a particular auditory structure (or set of auditory structures) in response to this sensory input. In this way, a given structure can be thought of as an auditory memory that may be re-activated even when there is no external sensory input (in hallucinations and dreams, for example) and grow stronger or weaker (less accessible) depending on the frequency with which it is activated successfully.\n\nPerceptual output structures are strongly interconnected. This enables a coordinated responses to events in the environment and assists the organism's chances of survival. This coordinating function of the POpS system may be related to the role of the global workspace in Baars' theory. At the same time, since POpS mediate between the external environment and the internal operations of the mind that are inaccessible to awareness, POpS conform closely with Jackendoff's Intermediate Theory of Consciousness. The rich interconnections between POpS permit very high levels of activation to be achieved, a hypothetical prerequisite for awareness to occur. It is also reflected in the condition known as synaesthesia: here the connection between two POpS reaches levels that result in an awareness whereby the two senses appear to merge; for example, a particular sound takes on the quality of a particular taste. Another example of connection is provided by the experimentally-induced McGurk effect. Here, two sensory signals are generated to produce a conflict; the subject's awareness is the result of an attempt to resolve the conflict, so that hearing one sound and simultaneously seeing the speaker pronounce a different sound will create the illusion of hearing a sound halfway between the actual sound and the sound suggested by the speaker's facial gestures (especially the movement of the lips).\n\nThe main point is that awareness (whether it can be classified as an illusion or not) is generated indirectly via POpS; we do not have direct access to the contents of any module or processing unit. While we can never become aware of the fine phonological and syntactic properties of the word \"dog\" - or its semantic and pragmatic properties, its \"conceptual structure\"(CS) - we can certainly become aware of its sound. In the same way, we can become aware of the sound of the creaking door. In both cases, it is auditory structure (one of the POpS) that gives rise to the conscious experience. As implied above, it is in the nature of linguistic structures (PS and SS) and its conceptual structures (CS) that they do \"not\" have the rich interconnectivity described above, and consequently do not (and \"cannot\") achieve the appropriate levels of activation for consciousness to occur. What we become conscious of arises directly from POpS activity. In other words, consciousness is always perceptual in nature.\n\nThe affective system works with \"affective structures\" (AfS) that are constructed using primitives such as \"fear\" and \"disgust\", which are discussed in affective neuroscience in the work of António Damásio. AfS are connected to POpS and contribute directly to appropriate responses of the organism to events in the immediate environment, to its chances of survival and to the experience of conscious awareness. Making these aspects of mental life more explicit helps researchers to understand and devise hypotheses about how consciousness and emotion affect online language performance and language acquisition. By the same token, it should help to show how certain aspects of language behaviour are (or might be) immune to such influence.\n\nLanguage is a vague term and is its widest sense involves a host of different processing units, only some of which are what makes human language unique to this species, that is, the phonological and syntactic expert systems that make up what, in generative linguistics, is called the language module and whose special properties are often subsumed under the name Universal Grammar. Closely associated with this core system, but not part of the language module per se, are a rich set of conceptual structures developed over the lifespan, as also b) auditory structures that have been matched up with phonological structures and c) visual structures created for interpreting writing and sign language. In addition, there are the various motor structures involved in the production of language in its different modes. One might lump all of this together and call it \"knowledge of language\". None of it, however, constitutes 'knowledge of language' if, by this term, we rather mean language that we can think and talk about and analyse, in other words \"metalinguistic knowledge\", which, as with all forms of metacognition, is constructed out of conceptual structure and various perceptual output structures. To take a simple example, the word \"horse\" can be discussed or pondered; all that is needed for this is an auditory structure (the sound of the word) and its visual structure (representing its orthographic, written form), both of which are matched up with its meaning as illustrated in the figure on the right. Not represented in the figure is the additional conceptual structure (over above the meaning of horse itself), consisting of metalinguistic concepts such as \"word, syllable, noun, definition\" and the like. These concepts are required for any analytic thinking about language and may vary widely in degree and complexity, depending on an individual's metalinguistic sophistication. In any case, the language module is not directly implicated in any explicit discussion (or explicit thinking) about what is actually a linguistic form. In the MOGUL version of metalinguistic processing, the essential chain of connections that are assembled completely bypasses the PS and SS systems. Processing within the language module will always kick in automatically on exposure of language stimuli, but metalinguistic (explicit) activity is processed elsewhere. Following the standard arguments from learnability theory as applied in generative linguistics, the language module is nevertheless crucial for all other types of linguistic activity and is vital for explaining the acquisition of language. No amount of activation of auditory and conceptual structure alone can explain the growth of language in the mind following repeated exposure to speech, most obviously in the case of little children and (arguably) adults as well.\n\nBecause of these two modes of knowing, we can appear to be very knowledgeable about the grammar of a particular language or grammar in general and yet be very poor users of that language. Or, like many native speakers, we can make metalinguistic assertions about the rules of our language which are not at all borne out by the way we actually speak and comprehend our mother tongue. Knowledge of a language, in this metalinguistic sense of the word, can also be \"right\" or \"wrong\". We can have misconceptions about language, or we can have a view of grammar that accords with the facts. By way of contrast, the system operated subconsciously within our language module can never be right or wrong: it is just the way it is, the way it as has developed in us over time. Metalinguistic knowledge is not useless, however. An essential part of education in many cultures is acquiring such consciously-accessible knowledge about language, and especially about the mother tongue. In MOGUL, however, this should not be confused with the implicit knowledge of language that drives language performance.\n\nIn this figure, the MOGUL version of the cognitive system is sketched in simplified form. The circles or ovals represent specialised processors, and the rectangular boxes each represent the particular memory store of structures which they are designed to handle. Affective structures (AfS) are not differentiated in this figure. Also, for simplicity's sake, only five \"senses\" are portrayed in the POpS system. All languages are handled by the same syntactic and phonological processors, but different languages will involve both shared and unique \"syntactic structures\" (SS) and \"phonological structures\" (PS) residing in (respectively) their syntactic and phonological memory stores. Mental activity is characterised by the formation of chains or networks of structures across different modules. This is achieved by means of interface processors (the dotted arrows) following Jackendoff (1987). These are bimodular, in that they match elements in two adjacent modules; they can only access and link certain structural elements in one or the other module. Moreover, the matching is not a \"translation\" of one element into terms (the code) of another system; there is no exchange of information, merely a chaining of elements that can otherwise only be processed within its own particular processing unit or module.\n\n\n\n"}

Her music combines traditional and contemporary material. Lamond is known as the vocalist on Ashley MacIsaac's 1995 hit single \"Sleepy Maggie\", and for her solo Top 40 hit \"Horo Ghoid thu Nighean\", the first single from her 1997 album \"Suas e!\". Her 2012 collaboration with fiddler Wendy MacIsaac, \"Seinn,\" was named one of the top 10 folk and americana albums of 2012 by National Public Radio in the United States.\n\nBorn in Kingston, Ontario, the youngest of five children, Lamond moved a number of times during her childhood, to a series of cities and towns in Ontario and Quebec. Her parents were both originally from Nova Scotia, however, and she often visited her father's parents in Cape Breton during her summer vacations. There she was first exposed to Celtic culture in general and to Gaelic music and the Gaelic language in particular. Lamond graduated from Westmount High School in Montreal, and then returned to Nova Scotia to enroll in the Celtic Studies program at St. Francis Xavier University, where she studied the school's collection of 350 field recordings of traditional Scots-Gaelic songs. She graduated with a minor in Music at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.\n\nWhile still a student, Lamond recorded an album of traditional material called \"Bho Thir Nan Craobh (From the Land of the Trees)\", which she released independently in 1994. Among the musicians on the album was fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. MacIsaac had first seen Lamond perform in 1991 with a local band in Antigonish and was impressed with what he saw as her \"punk attitude,\" even as she was singing Gaelic songs. MacIsaac and Lamond collaborated again in 1995 on the song \"Sleepy Maggie\" for his album \"Hi™ How Are You Today?\", which became a breakthrough recording for both of them.\n\nLamond followed this up with a solo album in 1997 called \"Suas e!\" (which in English means, roughly, \"Go for it!\"). The album was nominated for a Juno Award and an East Coast Music award. She released \"Làn Dùil\" in 1999, which cultural magazine PopMatters said \"should establish her as a major talent in Celtic and world music. \"Orain Ghàidhlig\", most of which was recorded live in North River, Cape Breton Island, followed in 2001.\n\nAfter 2000, Lamond mostly put her solo recording career aside for a variety of other projects, including composition for film and stage, and working with a variety of cultural agencies. Her most recent solo album to date is the 2005 recording \"Stòras\", which means \"a treasure\" in English. Also in 2005, she contributed the song \"Mo Mhaeli Bheag Og\" to the charity album \"Voyces United for UNHCR\".\n\nShe has been active in the ongoing preservation and revitalization of the Scottish Gaelic culture in Cape Breton as a member of the Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia and the Creative Nova Scotia Leadership Council, and as a teacher of Gaelic language and song workshops.\n\nIn September 2012, Lamond and fiddler Wendy McIsaac released the album \"Seinn\". \"Their guitar-and-fiddle matchup is beautifully balanced, behind butter-smooth vocals and timeless melodies,\" said a reviewer on NPR, which named the album as one of the year's top 10 folk and Americana albums. In November 2013, \"Seinn\" won a Canadian Folk Music Award for traditional album of the year and a Music Nova Scotia award for traditional/roots recording of the year.\n\nIn September 2017, Lamond announced a new collaborative project, \"Patchwork\", \"a project dedicated to the presentation of traditional song in a contemporary context.\" Patchwork consists of Lamond and her first cousin, Laurel MacDonald, who perform Gaelic and English language songs. They perform a show entitled \"She Sings as She Flies: Revisiting the Helen Creighton Song Collection,\" and will be joined by Nicole LeBlanc, Kirsten Olivia, and Naomi Dawn Poulette singing songs from the Acadian, African Nova Scotian, and Mi'kmaq communities, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Navigation lights give information on a craft's position, heading, and status. Their placement is mandated by international conventions or civil authorities. Navigation lights are not intended to provide illumination for the craft making the passage, only for other craft to be aware of it.\n\nIn 1838 the United States passed an act requiring steamboats running between sunset and sunrise to carry one or more signal lights; color, visibility and location were not specified.\nIn 1848 the United Kingdom passed regulations that required steam vessels to display red and green sidelights as well as a white masthead light. In 1849 the U.S. Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels.\nIn 1889 the United States convened the first International Maritime Conference to consider regulations for preventing collisions. The resulting Washington Conference Rules were adopted by the U.S in 1890 and became effective internationally in 1897. Within these rules was the requirement for steamships to carry a second mast head light.\nThe international 1948 Safety of Life at Sea Conference recommended a mandatory second masthead light solely for power driven vessels over 150 feet in length and a fixed sternlight for almost all vessels. The regulations have changed little since then.\n\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea established in 1972 stipulates the requirements for the navigation lights required on a vessel.\n\nTo avoid collisions, vessels mount navigation lights that permit other vessels to determine the type and relative angle of a vessel, and thus decide if there is a danger of collision. In general sailing vessels are required to carry a green light that shines from dead ahead to 2 points (°) abaft the beam on the starboard side (the right side from the perspective of someone on board facing forward), a red light from dead ahead to two points abaft the beam on the port side (left side) and a white light that shines from astern to two points abaft the beam on both sides. Power driven vessels, in addition to these lights, must carry either one or two (depending on length) white masthead lights that shine from ahead to two points abaft the beam on both sides. If two masthead lights are carried then the aft one must be higher than the forward one. Hovercraft at all times and some boats operating in crowded areas may also carry a yellow flashing beacon for added visibility during day or night.\n\nIn addition to red, white and green running lights, a combination of red, white and green Mast Lights placed on a mast higher than all the running lights, and viewable from all directions, may be used to indicate the type of craft or the service it is performing. See \"Quick Guide\" in external links.\n\n\nAircraft external lights are any light fitted to the exterior of an aircraft. They are usually used to increase visibility to others, and to signal actions such as entering an active runway or starting up an engine. Historically, incandescent bulbs have been used to provide light, however recently Light-emitting diodes have been used.\n\nAircraft navigation lights are placed in a way similar to that of marine vessels, with a red navigation light located on the left wingtip leading edge and a green light on the right wingtip leading edge. A white navigation light is as far aft as possible on the tail or each wing tip. High-intensity strobe lights are located on the aircraft to aid in collision avoidance. Anti-collision lights are flashing lights on the top and bottom of the fuselage, wingtips and tail tip. Their purpose is to alert others when something is happening that ground crew and other aircraft need to be aware of, such as running engines or entering active runways.\n\nIn civil aviation, pilots must keep navigation lights on from sunset to sunrise. High-intensity white strobe lights are part of the anti-collision light system, as well as the red rotating beacon.\n\nAll aircraft built after 11 March 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights or rotating beacon) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The anti-collision system is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the beacon lights on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These beacon lights stay on for the duration of the flight. While taxiing, the taxi lights are on. When coming onto the runway, the taxi lights go off and the landing lights and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing. Landing lights are bright white, forward and downward facing lights on the front of an aircraft. Their purpose is to allow the pilot to see the landing area, and to allow ground crew to see the approaching aircraft.\n\nCivilian commercial airliners also have other non-navigational lights. These include logo lights, which illuminate the company logo on the tail fin. These lights are optional to turn on, though most pilots switch them on at night to increase visibility from other aircraft. Modern airliners also have a wing light. These are positioned on the outer side just in front of the engine cowlings on the fuselage. These are not required to be on, but in some cases pilots turn these lights on for engine checks and also while passengers board the aircraft for better visibility of the ground near the aircraft.\n\nIn 2011, ORBITEC developed the first Light-emitting diode (LED) lighting system for use around spacecraft. Currently, Cygnus spacecraft, which are unmanned transport vessels designed for cargo transport to the International Space Station, utilize a navigational lighting system consisting of five flashing high power LED lights. The Cygnus displays a flashing red light on the port side of the vessel, a flashing green on the starboard side of the vessel, two flashing white lights on the top and one flashing yellow on the bottom side of the fuselage.\n\nThe SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft also features a flashing strobe along with red and green lights.\n\n"}

{"id": "20626363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20626363", "title": "Old Georgian language", "text": "Old Georgian language\n\nOld Georgian ( \"dzveli kartuli ena\", Old Georgian: ႤႬႠჂ ႵႠႰႧႳႪႨ, \"enay kartuli\") the literary language of Georgian monarchies in the 5th century. The language remains in use as the liturgical language of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Spoken Old Georgian gave way to what is classified as Middle Georgian in the 11th century, which in turn developed into the modern Georgian language in the 18th century.\n\nTwo periods are distinguished within Old Georgian: Early Old Georgian (5th to 8th centuries) and Classical Old Georgian (9th to 11th centuries). Two different dialects are represented in Early Old Georgian, known as Khanmet’i (ხანმეტი, 5th to 7th c.) and Haemet’i (ჱაემეტი, 7th and 8th c.). They are so named after the presence of a second person subject prefix and a third person object prefix \"kh-\" or \"h-\" in the verbal morphology where Classical Old Georgian has \"h-\", \"s-\" or zero.\n\nThe corpus of Early Old Georgian texts is limited in size, consisting of a dozen inscriptions and eight manuscripts containing religious texts. The literature in Classical Old Georgian has a wider scope, including philosophical and historiographical works.\n\nOld Georgian had 29 phonemic consonants and 5 phonemic vowels. The native spelling also distinguishes the semivowel \"y\", which is an allophone of the vowel \"i\" in postvocalic position.\n\nOld Georgian was written in its own alphabetic script, known as Asomtavruli \"capital letters\" or Mrglovani \"rounded\". The alphabet is very nearly phonemic, showing an excellent \"fit\" between phonemes and graphemes. It is clearly modelled on the Greek alphabet, showing basically the same alphabetic order, and with letters representing non-Greek phonemes gathered at the end. Apart from letters for nearly all Georgian phonemes, the alphabet also contains three letters representing Greek phonemes not found in Georgian (\"ē\", \"ü\" and \"ō\"). Most individual letters seem to be entirely independent designs, with only a few based directly on their Greek counterparts (cf. Greek Φ Θ Χ [pʰ tʰ kʰ], Asomtavruli Ⴔ Ⴇ Ⴕ).\n\nOld Georgian orthography is quite consistent, in the sense that the same word is usually witten in the same way in all instances. Spelling is nearly phonemic, with almost all phonemes exclusively represented by a single letter. The exceptions are described below.\n\nThe most conspicuous exception to the rule that each phoneme is written with its own letter is the vowel \"u\", which is consistently written with the digraph ႭჃ 〈oü〉, for example ႮႭჃႰႨ 〈p’oüri〉 \"p’uri\" \"bread\". This usage was evidently adopted from Greek spelling, which writes \"u\" as ου. In the later Nuskhuri script, the original digraph ⴍⴣ 〈oü〉 merged into a single letter ⴓ 〈u〉 (modern Mkhedruli script უ). A matching Asomtavruli single-letter counterpart Ⴓ was then divised; this letter was not part of the original alphabet, and was not used in the Old Georgian period.\n\nThe semivowel \"w\" is written in two ways, depending on its position within the word. When it occurs directly after a consonant, it is written with the digraph ႭჃ 〈oü〉, for example ႹႭჃႤႬ 〈choüen〉 \"chwen\" \"we\", ႢႭჃႰႨႲႨ 〈goürit’i〉 \"gwrit’i\" \"turtledove\". The digraph ႭჃ 〈oü〉 thus represents both \"w\" and \"u\", without differentiation in the spelling, for example ႵႭჃႧႨ 〈khoüti〉 \"khuti\" \"five\" vs. ႤႵႭჃႱႨ 〈ekoüsi〉 \"ekwsi\" \"six\".\n\nIn all other positions, \"w\" is written with the letter Ⴅ 〈v〉, for example ႧႭႥႪႨ 〈tovli〉 \"towli\" \"snow\", ႥႤႪႨ 〈veli〉 \"weli\" \"field\", ႩႠႰႠႥႨ 〈k’aravi〉 \"k’arawi\" \"tent\".\n\nThe two spellings of \"w\" clearly represent an allophonic variation like the one described for modern Georgian, between [w] in postconsonantal position and [ʋ] or [β] in other positions. In modern Georgian spelling (as standardized in 1879), both [w] and [ʋ/β] are consistently written with ვ 〈v〉, and spellings with Ⴅ 〈v〉 instead of the expected ჃႭ 〈oü〉 are already found in Old Georgian.\n\nThe initial vowel \"i-\" of a case suffix is realized as \"y-\" after a vowel, and this allophonic \"y\" has its own letter in the alphabet, for example ႣႤႣႠჂ ႨႤႱႭჃჂႱႠ 〈deday iesoüysa〉 \"deda-y iesu-ysa\" , phonemically /deda-i iesu-isa/ (mother-NOM Jesus-GEN) \"the mother of Jesus\".\n\nThe Asomtavruli alphabet contains three letters which are not needed for the writing of native words: Ⴡ 〈ē〉, Ⴣ 〈ü〉 and Ⴥ 〈ō〉. These were added to the alphabet in order to make possible a letter-for-letter transliteration of Greek names and loanwords. They were indeed occasionally used to write the Greek vowels \"ē\" (ēta), \"ü\" (ypsilon) and \"ō\" (ōmega). As these vowels are alien to Georgian, they were replaced in actual pronunciation by \"ey\", \"wi\" and \"ow\" respectively, as can be deduced from old variant spellings, and from corresponding modern forms. For example, Greek Αἴγυπτος is written ႤႢჃႮႲႤ 〈egüp’t’e〉 \"egwip’t’e\" \"Egypt\" (cf. modern Georgian ეგვიპტე \"egvip’t’e\").\n\nIn native words, the letter Ⴥ 〈ō〉 was mainly used to write the vocative particle, for example Ⴥ ႣႤႣႨႩႠႺႭ 〈ō dedik’atso〉 \"o dedik’atso\" \"o woman!\"\n\nThe letters Ⴡ 〈ē〉 and Ⴣ 〈ü〉 on the other hand were frequently used in the spelling of native words, as a short-hand way of representing the sequences \"ey\" and \"wi\", for example ႫႤႴჁ 〈mepē〉 \"mepey\" \"king\", ႶჃႬႭჂ 〈ghünoy〉 \"ghwinoy\" \"wine\". Spelling can thus vary within a paradigm, for example ႱႨႲႷႭჃႠჂ 〈sit’q’oüay〉 \"sit’q’wa-y\" \"word\" (nominative case) vs. ႱႨႲႷჃႱႠ 〈sit’q’üsa〉 \"sit’q’w-isa\" (genitive). The sequences \"ey\" and \"wi\" could also be written out in full however, for example ႫႤႴႤჂ 〈mepey〉 \"mepey\", ႶႭჃႨႬႭჂ 〈ghoüinoy〉 \"ghwinoy\" \"wine\" (also ႶჃႨႬႭჂ 〈ghüinoy〉, a mixed spelling).\n\n"}

{"id": "5734697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5734697", "title": "Persian vocabulary", "text": "Persian vocabulary\n\nPersian belongs to the Indo-European language family, and many words in modern Persian usage ultimately originate from Proto-Indo-European. The language makes extensive use of word building techniques such as affixation and compounding to derive new words from roots. Persian has also had considerable contact with other languages, resulting in many borrowings.\n\nPersian is very powerful in word building and versatile in ways a word can be built from combining affixes, stems, nouns and adjectives. Having many affixes to form new words (over a hundred), and the ability to build affixes and specially prefixes from nouns, The Persian language is also claimed to be and demonstrated as an agglutinative language since it also frequently uses derivational agglutination to form new words from nouns, adjectives, and verbal stems. New words are also extensively formed by compounding – two existing words combining into a new one, as is common in German, Sanskrit and hence most of the Indian languages. Professor Mahmoud Hessaby demonstrated that Persian can derive more than 226 million words.\n\nAn example set of words derived from a present stem combined with some of available affixes:\n\nAn example set of words derived from a past stem combined with some of available affixes:\n\nThere are also a considerable amount of loanwords in the Persian language, mostly coming from Arabic, French, and the Turkic languages. Recently some English loanwords has entered the language too. \n\nPersian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially Arabic, Armenian, Georgian, Indo-Iranian languages and Turkic languages. Many Persian words have also found their way into the English language.\n\nThe Arab conquest of Iran lasted for two centuries, from the 7th to the 9th CE. Arabic gradually replaced Middle Persian as a official language and Arabic became the language of the Persian intellectuals during Golden Age of Islam. During this period, many Arabic words were imported into the Persian language, and a number of Persian words found their way into Arabic. Persian words of Arabic origin especially include Islamic terms. Arabic has had an extensive influence on the Persian lexicon, but it has not greatly affected the structure of the language. Although a considerable portion of the lexicon is derived from Arabic roots, including some of the Arabic plural patterns, the morphological process used to obtain these lexical elements has not been imported into Persian and is not productive in the language. \nThese Arabic words have been imported and lexicalized in Persian. So, for instance, the Arabic plural form for \"ketāb\" (كتاب) [\"book\"] is \"kutub\" (كتب) obtained by the root derivation system. In Persian, the plural for the lexical word \"ketâb\" is obtained by simply adding the Persian plural morpheme \"hā\": \"ketāb+hā\" → \"ketābhā\" (كتاب‌ها). Also, any new Persian words can only be pluralized by the addition of this plural morpheme since the Arabic root system is not a productive process in Persian. In addition, since the plurals formed by the Arabic morphological system constitute only a small portion of the Persian vocabulary (about 5% in the Shiraz corpus), it is not necessary to include them in the morphology; they are instead listed in the dictionary as irregular forms.\n\nIn fact, among Iranians there have been sporadic efforts as far back as the Safavid Empire to revive Persian and diminish the use of Arabic loanwords in their language. Both Pahlavi Shahs supported such efforts in the 20th century by creating the academy of Persian Language and Literature. In 1934, Reza Shah ordered to rebuild tomb of Ferdowsi, who is regarded as the savior of Persian language, and set up a ceremony in Mashhad, celebrating a thousand years of Persian literature since the time of Ferdowsi, titled \"Ferdowsi Millenary Celebration\" (). \n\nAcademy of Persian language and literature after the Iranian revolution continued its striving to protect the integrity of the Persian language. However, the attention of the academy has been turned towards the persistent infiltration of Persian, like many other languages, with English words, as a result of the globalization process. Since the 1980s, the academy constantly campaigns for the use of the Persian equivalents of these new English loanwords. It also has the task of linguistically deriving such words from existing Persian roots if no such equivalents exist, and actively promoting the adoption of these new coinages instead of their English equivalents in the daily lives of the Persian-speaking people in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\n\nLess noticeable, but also considerable are the Turkic forms (including Mongolian borrowings) that have entered the Persian language. Throughout history, the Persian-speaking realm, including the Iranian plateau, was ruled by a succession of dynasties of Turkic origin, notably Ghaznavid, Seljuk, the Sultanate of Rum, Timurid, Qajar, and Ottomans which have patronized Persian culture and literature. Even the Mongol Il-Khanate brought more Turkic speakers, who constituted the backbone of the Mongol armies, to the Iranian plateau. With the exception of certain official designations within the government, trade and military, many of the Turkic borrowings in Persian have a more informal, homely flavour, and therefore, to many Persian native speakers these words do not feel like foreign: e.g. \"āqā\" 'mister', \"dowqolu\" 'twin', \"komak\" 'help', \"toman\" 'official currency of Iran' (but \"riāl\" < Portuguese), \"yābu\" 'pack nag', \"qeshlāq\" 'village; summer quarters', \"jelow\" 'front; bridle', \"qeychi\" 'scissors'.\n\nOver the past couple of centuries, Persian has borrowed many loanwords from European languages (mainly French). A lot of these loanwords were originally French and use French pronunciation, also other common words mainly come from English, Italian, German, and Russian (example: samovar) as well.\nThe table below shows some examples of common French/Persian words.\n\n"}
{"id": "1234508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1234508", "title": "Portuguese vocabulary", "text": "Portuguese vocabulary\n\nMost of the Portuguese vocabulary comes from Latin, because Portuguese is a Romance language. However, other languages that came into contact with it have also left their mark. In the thirteenth century, the lexicon of Portuguese had about 80% words of Latin origin and 20% of pre-Roman Gallaecian and Celtiberian, Germanic and Arabic origin.\n\nTraces of the languages of the native peoples of western Iberia (Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici or Conii) persist in the language, as shown below. \nMost of the pre-Roman placenames or rivers in Portugal originate from the Hispano-Celtic Gallaecian and Celtiberian languages. There are also a few Lusitanian, Iberian, Basque and Tartessian components in Portuguese.\n\n\nProjections on Iberian vocabulary, toponyms and derivations in Portuguese, indicate just a few dozen words in total.\n\nA claim of Basque influence in Portuguese is the voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant [], a sound transitional between laminodental [] and palatal []; this sound also influenced other Ibero-Romance languages such as Catalan. The apico-alveolar retracted sibilant is a result of bilingualism of speakers of Basque and Vulgar Latin. Basque influence is prominent in Portuguese language and entered through Spanish, because aside from it is a result of bilingualism of speakers of Basque and Vulgar Latin, many Castilians (native speakers of Spanish) who took part in the Reconquista and later repopulation campaigns were of Basque lineage. There are a few words, surnames and forenames:\n\n\nNames of Basque origin:\n\nForenames:\n\nSurnames:\n\nAlthough there is not a comprehensive study or wordcount on how much Celtic (Gallaecian or Celtiberian) survived in Portuguese (and Galician), it is fair to say that after Latin, this ancient language or fragments of several languages; is the second largest component in the Portuguese language. Projections on Celtic vocabulary (excluding more modern French and other loanwords), toponyms and derivations in Portuguese, indicate well over 1,500 words. The Celtic component is often overlooked, due to the strong Latinisation of Celtic-derived words in Portuguese.\n\nPlacenames: \nThere are numerous Celtic-derived towns and placenames in Portugal like Abrantes, Abrunhosa-a-Velha, Aveiro, Braga, Braganza (Bragança), Bidoeira, Briteiros, Menir de Forjães, Menir do Castelo, Cabanas de Viriato, Dólmen da Pedreira, Borba, Bouçã, Bouças, Bouçoães, Brejo, Briteiros, Britelo, Caminha, Cantanhede, Carvalhos, Carvalhosa, Carvalhal, Carvalhais, Carvalha, Carvalheira, Carvalhoa, Cerva, Cervaínhos, Cerval, Cervanha, Cervão, Cervas, Cerveira, Cerveiro, Cervela, Cervelhe, Cervelhos, Cervetelos, Cervicol, Cervinho (Latinised 'cervum' from Proto-Celtic *kerbho-), Casal de Cambra, Coimbra, Coruche, Crato, Amieira, Amieiro, Vale do Amieiro, Évora, Gouvães do Douro, Gouveia, Lagos, Lajeosa do Dão, Lamego, Lapa, Lapa do Lobo, Leiria, Lousã, Luso, Maia, Minho, Nóbrega, St Antão do Tojal, São Julião do Tojal, Setúbal, Sintra, Tojeira, Vale de Cambra, Vargem, Vidoeira, Monte das Vargens, Xabregas and many others.\n\nRivers: \nArdila, Douro, Minho, Tâmega. \nEven the apparently Mozarabic river 'Guadiana' (Waddi+Anas) derives from the ancient Celtic 'Anas' river, with 'Guadi' (waddi, Arabic for river) added in the Middle-Ages.\n\n\nSurnames:\nA considerable number of the Portuguese surnames (spread in all Portuguese-speaking countries and ex-colonies today) is Celtic or of Latinised, Celtic-borrowings. This is not a comprehensive list of those.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Germanic influence (Suebi, Visigoths, Buri, Vandals) in Portuguese is often related to warfare/military topics, but also exists in other vocabulary like animals texugo (badger), natural world orvalho (dew), Human qualities like franqueza (frankness, candour), orgulho (pride), some verbs like ganhar (to gain), town and placenames such as Aldão, Alderete, Albergaria-a-Velha, Albergaria-a-Nova (from Gothic 'haribergo'), Ermesinde and Esposende, where \"sinde\" and \"sende\" for instance; are derived from the Germanic \"sinths\" (military expedition), numerous Suebi derivations like, Freamunde (from 'Fredemundus'), Vermunde, Amonde (Onomondi), Samonde, Gimonde, Aldão, Guadramil, Gondomil, Samil, Gosende, Guilhofrei (from Geodefredis), Esmoriz, Esmeriz (toponymics of Hermeric, king of the Suebians), Alhariz (toponymic of Aliaricus), Oriz, Touriz, Roriz, Gondoriz, Gondizalves, Gondar, Gondomar (from Gundomarus), Gondarém, Gudim, Guimarães (from Vimara), Torres Vedras (from Turres Veteras, 'old tower'), Sousa, Terras de Sousa and Terras de Bouro (land of the Buri), Serra do Bouro, Bouro, are found mainly in the Minho (Braga) and Douro (Porto) regions- these two provinces present the highest concentration of Germanic toponyms in the Iberian Peninsula, as they historically correspond to old the Suebic Kingdom in the middle-ages. Many of the Germanic words entered the language during the late antiquity, either as words introduced into Vulgar Latin elsewhere, or as words brought along by the Suebi who settled in Gallaecia (Northern Portugal and Galicia) in the 5th century, and also by the Visigoths who annexed the Suebic Kingdom in 585 and ruled until the 8th century AD. \nOther words were incorporated to Portuguese during the Middle Ages, mostly proceeding from French and Occitan languages, as both cultures had a massive impact in Portuguese during the 12th and 13th centuries. Some everyday vocabulary, towns and placenames have Frankish-derived etymology, by influence of French in that period. Examples are: \nflanco- (flank) from Old French flanc, of Germanic origin, probably Frankish *hlanca, from Proto-Germanic *hlankaz (“flexible\", \"to bend”), from Proto-Indo-European *kleng- (“to bend”). Akin to Old High German hlanca (“loin”), Middle High German lanke (“hip joint”) (German lenken (“to bend, turn, lead”)), Old English hlanc (“loose, slender, flaccid, lank). \nCarção - a small town in Portugal, from Medieval Portuguese “garçom”, from Old French garçun (“servant”), oblique case of gars, from Frankish *wrakjō (“servant, boy”), from Proto-Germanic *wrakjô (“exile, driven one”), from Proto-Indo-European *wreg- (“to drive”). Cognate with Old High German wrecheo, recko (“exile, warrior, hero”) (Modern German Recke), Old Saxon wrekkio (“a banished person, exile, stranger”), Old English wreċċa (“a wretch, stranger, exile”), and perhaps to Old Norse rekkr (“man, warrior, hero”).\n\nMore recently other words with Germanic origin have been incorporated, either directly from English or other Germanic languages, or indirectly through French. Many of these words are shared with Galician, sometimes with minor spelling or phonetic differences.\n\nBecause they have different Germanic origins, this list is divided into words that come from English, Frankish, Langobardic, Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle Low German, Old English, Old High German, Old Norse, Old Swedish, and Visigothic and finally, words which come from a Germanic root, where the specific source is unknown or uncertain. Projections indicate over 600 Germanic words in Portuguese, with a tendency to increase due to English, German and other modern influences.\nSome of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from other languages. Some of these words have alternate etymologies and may also appear on a list of Galician words from a different language. Some words contain non-Germanic elements. Any form with an asterisk (*) is unattested and therefore hypothetical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatin words of Germanic origin:\n\nLangobardic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAncient Roman-derived names are the most numerous in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking countries. Together with Germanic-derived names they constitute the majority of those (and similarly to most European/Western countries inherited also a number of ancient Greek and Hebrew names) today. With globalisation, a number of new Germanic names (and other origins) exist in Portuguese:\n\n\n\n\nBetween the 8th and mid 13th centuries, Portugal was occupied and under the influence of the Islamic Emirate of Cordoba known as (Al-Andalus). During that period, although the local populations continued to speak Western Romance, and further south Mozarabic dialects; Arabic being the elite language, lent many new words to Portuguese, thanks to a rich cultural and scientific legacy left in the Iberian Peninsula and the Western world in the Middle Ages.\nWords such as 'algebra','algorism (algorithm)', 'alcohol', 'azimuth', 'sugar', 'coffee' and many others were incorporated into Portuguese and are everyday words:\n\n\nMany words from the Islamic period were borrowings from Spanish and Mozarabic dialects from the South. Because Portugal expelled the Moors 300 years earlier than Spain, the Arabic influence in Portuguese was relatively small and left no loanwords in the Portuguese lexicon related to human feelings or emotions. Arabic-derived words are easily identifiable in toponymic names of towns and villages, increasing as you travel south Alfama, Alcácer do Sal, Alcoutim, Aljustrel, Algarve and in words relating to geography, agriculture, architecture, astronomy, mathematics, chemicals and food.

The basic idea is to prepare the files to make them feasible for the correct process such as offset printing and eliminate costly errors and facilitate an smooth production. It is an standard prepress procedure in the printing industry (as it is imposition). The term originates from the preflight checklists used by pilots. The term was first used in a presentation at the Color Connections conference in 1990 by consultant Chuck Weger, and Professor Ron Bertolina was a pioneer for solutions to preflighting in the 1990s.\n\nIn a common digital prepress workflow, a collection of computer files provided by clients will be translated from an application-specific format such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress to a format that the raster image processor (RIP) can interpret. But before this rasterization occurs, workers in the prepress department confirm the incoming materials to make sure they are ready to be sent to the RIP. This is an important step because it prevents production delays caused by missing materials or improperly prepared materials. Once the incoming materials have passed the pre-flight check, they are ready to be put into production and sent to the RIP.\n\nFiles were originally printed as Adobe PostScript; however in modern workflows, PDF files have become the popular file type for submitting data to a RIP. The RIP generates the final raster image that will be printed directly (as in desktop inkjet or laser printing), set to photographic film or paper (using an imagesetter), or transferred direct-to-plate.\n\nDepending on the hardware and software components and configurations, RIPs can experience problems rasterizing the image data contained in PostScript or PDF files. If there is a failure in rasterizing the image, it can be costly, as output systems (printers, plate-setters, etc.) consume expensive supplies, can require extensive amounts of time to process complex image data, and require skilled labor to operate.\n\nThe process of preflighting a file helps reduce the likelihood of rasterization problems that cause production delays. Page layout software applications (which allow users to combine images, graphics, and text from a variety of formats) automate portions of the preflight process. Typically, client-provided materials are verified by a preflight operator for completeness and to confirm that the incoming materials meet the production requirements. The pre-flight process checks for:\n\n\nOther, more advanced preflight steps might also include:\n\nThe specifics of what checks are made is governed by the features of the preflight application, the formats of the client provided files, and the targeted output device as well as the printing specifications.\n\nA purpose-built software application is not required to preflight a file, although several commercial applications are available. Many desktop publishing applications have some type of preflight capability, however they may not be as robust as commercial applications. Many printers and publishers utilize high-end preflight and file optimization solutions rather than relying on those within desktop publishing apps. They will make sure the preflight settings match their specific production requirements.\n\nProfessor Ron Bertolina was a pioneer of the preflighting concept in electronic publishing. In the mid 1990s, he wrote published technical articles and conducted workshops across the US on preflighting for the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation. His preflight checklist, included in the article \"Preflighting Digital Files\" for GATFWorld magazine, became a standard for printing companies to follow to help to reduce costly errors and thus was a great benefit to the publishing industry. Eventually, preflighting software entered the marketplace to assist designers and publishers in efficiently publishing electronic files.\n\nEarly preflight methods were largely manual, and typically relied on checklists that highly skilled prepress operators would use to verify the production readiness of each incoming job. As desktop publishing and graphics applications, PDLs, RIPs, and output devices evolved, the process became more complex. Software plug-ins and stand-alone applications that supported the major desktop publishing applications were then developed to meet that need, along with proprietary tools made by hardware manufacturers and commercial printers and service bureaus. The developers of the major applications then began to incorporate functionality in their applications, leveraging their knowledge of their own file formats.\n"}

That model differs from \"Calling Party Pays\" in which the caller is the one who pays for the other side receiving it.\n\nThe total cost of each call placed by a subscriber of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) is split in two parts. The first part is the amount that the caller's provider is charging in order to provide the service to the calling party. The second part is the mobile termination rates (MTRs) that the provider of the call-receiver demands to deliver a call. Concerning the MTRs, in North America and some parts of Asia the Receiving party pays (RPP) instead of the Calling party pays (CPP) principle is applied. In contrast to the CPP principle, in RPP the callee is asked to pay for the termination cost or in some cases to share a part of this cost with the caller. Initially this approach sounds fair, especially in the scope of the callee payment for the call receiving service, while he is mobile and not located in his home network. Furthermore, a subscriber is free to compare termination rates of each MNO and to make his choice before the establishment of a contract with a MNO. Thereby, the mobile termination rates market seems to allow for competition.\n\nHowever, the question of how a called party could avoid paying for unwanted calls (e.g., advertisements, tele-sales, or polls) is raised. The answer is that it is the callee's responsibility to distinguish, which call is important and should be accepted and which should be rejected. This is only one of the RPP side effects that feared to slow-down the mobile sector in the past. The RPP principle may add an extra degree of freedom in the mobile call charges, since the termination rate is not a part of the total cost that the caller has to pay. However, it is also adding a considerably big overhead for consumers such as the provider selection decision, while considering the callee role.\n\n"}

The essay later became part of the book by the same name. The essay remains a key statement in poststructuralist approaches to literary studies.\n\nPaul de Man says that the essay was written at the request of the Committee on the Research Activities of the Modern Language Association as a contribution to a collective volume entitled \"Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures\". However, the essay was not accepted as it argued that \"the main theoretical interest of literary theory consists in the impossibility of its definition.\"\n\nBut keeping in view with the proposal the essay discusses the rise of literary theory in America in the twentieth century and the challenges it faces. He points out that, \"literary theory can be said to come into being when the approach to literary texts is no longer based on non-linguistic, that is to say historical and aesthetic considerations.\" This introduction of linguistic and semiotic terminology into literary studies, according to de Man, gives the language, \"considerable freedom from referential restraint\" and makes it \"epistemologically highly suspect and volatile.\" Drawing on the ideas of Saussure and Nietzsche, de Man points out that the rhetorical and tropological dimension of language makes it an unreliable medium for communication of truths. Literary language is predominantly rhetorical and figurative. Therefore, to take for granted that literature is a reliable source of information about anything but itself would be a great mistake.\n\nThis gives rise to a particular crisis in literary studies because \"literariness\" is no longer seen as an aesthetic quality nor a mimetic mode. Aesthetic effect, according to de Man, takes place because we tend to mistake the materiality of the signifier with the materiality of the signified by considering language as an intuitive and transparent medium, as opposed to the material and conventional medium that it is. Mimesis, like aesthetic quality, is also an effect of the rhetorical and figurative aspects of language. The assumption of ideological and historical contexts or backgrounds to literary texts becomes problematic if language is no longer seen as a transparent and intuitive guide from the textual material to the historical situation. Consequently, the theorists who uphold an aesthetic approach to literary studies and those who uphold an historical approach both find theory inconvenient and challenging. They are the polemical opponents of theory. \n\nAs theory is as much a linguistic construct as literature, it falls prey to the same problematics of literary language. De Man states that the resistance to theory may be \"a built-in constituent of its discourse.\" The real debate of literary theory is henceforth \"not with its polemical opponents but rather with its own methodological assumptions and possibilities.\" (p. 358) This is because \"the resistance to theory is a resistance to the use of language about language.\" The resistance to theory is therefore, according to de Man, a resistance to reading: \"Nothing can overcome the resistance to theory since theory 'is' itself this resistance.\"\n\nDe Man concludes however by stating that \"literary theory is not in danger of going under; it cannot help but flourish, and the more it is resisted, the more it flourishes, since the language it speaks is the language of self resistance.\" (p. 365)\n\n\n"}
