In 1966, he founded the Bengali literary quarterly and little magazine \"Anustup\".\n\nAcharya graduated with an honors degree in English literature from the Scottish Church College. Thereafter he earned his master's degree in English literature from the University of Calcutta. He started publishing the literary quarterly \"Anustup\" as an undergraduate student at Scottish Church College in 1966.\n\nSince his college days, he has written poems, short stories and essays in Bengali and English. After earning a postgraduate degree in English literature, he started out as a lecturer, and later became a reader and then associate professor in English at the Serampore College, within the aegis of the University of Calcutta. He was also Head of the Department of English and set up the Communicative English programme in Serampore College.\n\nHe is a member of the Publisher and Bookseller's Guild, the organisers of the Kolkata Book Fair, which is Asia's largest book fair and the most attended book fair in the world. He was elected Secretary of the Guild for three successive terms, between 1996-1998, and during his tenure, the noted French Philosopher Jacques Derrida inaugurated the Kolkata Book Fair in 1997.\n\nHe has spent a life in writing and editing his quarterly journal, and has also founded an English language literary periodical for translated short stories from Bengali, called \"Harvest\". In 1970, he assisted the Australian director Paul Cox as the assistant director in making the documentary on Calcutta. He was also the associate producer of Paul Cox's film \"Force of Destiny\" released in 2014. He is currently associated with St. Thomas' College of Engineering and Technology, Kolkata.\n\nBetween February 2013 and February 2015, he wrote a regular Sunday column in the Bengali newspaper 'Ei Somoy', called \"Nipaatone Siddho\". It documented the myriad experiences, that played out across four decades in the Bengali cultural and political landscape, and shaped Anustup and what it stands for. He is also the author of the Bengali book titled \"Parasmaipadi\" which is a collection of his selected articles.\n\n\"Anustup\" is a literary journal. In 1972, it was the first to have an independent publishing wing. True to the vision of \"Little Magazine\" movement that emerged in the 70's in Bengal, its aim is to publish works that established publishers would overlook. The editorial board wanted to promote promising authors and new genres of writing. Due to the initial efforts of this journal, many others followed suit and this led to a qualitative improvement in terms of production in contemporary Bengali literature. Since its inception, \"Anustup\" has seen the likes of contributions from Amiya Bagchi, Partha Chatterjee, Ashis Nandy, Shankha Ghosh, Gautam Bhadra, Hemanga Biswas and Ranajit Guha.\n\nIn recognition of his efforts, in 2012, he was appointed as a \"Tagore National Scholar\" by the Ministry of Culture of the Government of India.\n\n"}

Bixby was introduced alongside the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+, as well as the Samsung Galaxy Tab A during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2017 event, which was held on March 29, 2017. Samsung officially unveiled Bixby a week before launch but it only made its first appearance during the event. Bixby can also be sideloaded on older Galaxy devices running Android Nougat.\n\nBixby represents a major reboot for S Voice, Samsung's voice assistant app introduced in 2012 with the Galaxy S III.\n\nIn May 2017, Samsung announced that Bixby would be coming to its line of Family Hub 2.0 refrigerators, making it the first non-mobile product to include the virtual assistant.\n\nIn October 2017, Samsung announced the release of Bixby 2.0 during its annual developer conference in San Francisco. The new version is set to be rolled out across the company’s line of connected products, including smartphones, TVs, and refrigerators. Moreover, third parties will be allowed to develop applications for Bixby using the Samsung Developer Kit.\n\nBixby comes with three parts, known as \"Bixby Voice\", \"Bixby Vision\" and \"Bixby Home\".\n\nWith \"Bixby Voice\", the user can trigger Bixby by calling it or doing a long press of the Bixby Button located below the volume rocker. A while before the phone's release, the Bixby Button was reprogrammable and could be set to open other applications or assistants, such as Google Assistant. Near the phone's release, however, this ability was removed with a firmware update, but can be remapped using third party apps.\n\n\"Bixby Vision\" is built into the camera app and can \"see\" what one can see as it is essentially an augmented reality camera that can identify objects in real time, search for them on various services, and offer the user to purchase them if available. Bixby is also able to translate text, read QR codes, and recognize landmarks.\n\n\"Bixby Home\" can be found by swiping to the right on the home screen or doing a short press on the Bixby Button. It is a vertically scrolling list of information that Bixby can interact with, for example, weather, fitness activity, and buttons for controlling their smart home gadgets.\n\nBixby supports three languages including Chinese. It also supports contextual search and visual search.\n\nSamsung reported that Bixby would not be operational on the US version of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ when the devices were first shipped to consumers on April 21, 2017. Samsung stated that the key features of Bixby, including Vision, Home and Reminder, would be available with the global launch of the smartphones. Bixby Voice was intended to be made available in the US on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ later that spring. However, the release of the English version was postponed as Samsung had problems getting Bixby to fully understand the language.\n\nAs of April 2018, Bixby is available in over 195 countries, but only in Korean, English (US only), and Chinese (Mandarin). The Chinese version of Bixby is only available on devices officially sold in Mainland China. Bixby Korean was launched on May 1, 2017 (KST).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49376493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49376493", "title": "Cambridge Analytica", "text": "Cambridge Analytica\n\nCambridge Analytica Ltd (CA) was a British political consulting firm which combined data mining, data brokerage, and data analysis with strategic communication during the electoral processes. It was started in 2013 as an offshoot of the SCL Group. The company closed operations in 2018, although related firms continued in existence.\n\nThe company was partly owned by the family of Robert Mercer, an American hedge-fund manager who supports many politically conservative causes. The firm maintained offices in London, New York City, and Washington, DC. CEO Alexander Nix has said CA was involved in 44 US political races in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, it performed data analysis services for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. In 2016, CA worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign as well as for Leave.EU (one of the organisations campaigning in the United Kingdom's referendum on European Union membership). CA's role in those campaigns has been controversial and is the subject of ongoing criminal investigations in both countries. Political scientists question CA's claims about the effectiveness of its methods of targeting voters.\n\nIn March 2018, multiple media outlets broke news of Cambridge Analytica's business practices. \"The New York Times\" and \"The Observer\" reported that the company had acquired and used personal data about Facebook users from an external researcher who had told Facebook he was collecting it for academic purposes. Shortly afterwards, Channel 4 News aired undercover investigative videos showing Nix boasting about using prostitutes, bribery sting operations, and honey traps to discredit politicians on whom it conducted opposition research, and saying that the company \"ran all of (Donald Trump's) digital campaign\". In response to the media reports, the Information Commissioner of the UK pursued a warrant to search the company's servers. Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from advertising on its platform, saying that it had been deceived. On 23 March 2018, the British High Court granted the Information Commissioner's Office a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's London offices.\n\nThe personal data of approximately 87 million Facebook users were acquired via the 270,000 Facebook users who used a Facebook app called \"This Is Your Digital Life.\" By giving this third-party app permission to acquire their data, back in 2015, this also gave the app access to information on the user's friends network; this resulted in the data of about 87 million users, the majority of whom had not explicitly given Cambridge Analytica permission to access their data, being collected. The app developer breached Facebook's terms of service by giving the data to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nOn 1 May 2018, Cambridge Analytica and its parent company filed for insolvency proceedings and closed operations. Alexander Taylor, a former director for Cambridge Analytica, was appointed director of Emerdata on 28 March 2018.\n\nCambridge Analytica (SCL USA) was incorporated in January 2015 with its registered office in Westferry Circus, London and just one staff member, its director and CEO Alexander James Ashburner Nix (also appointed in January 2015). Nix is also the director of nine similar companies sharing the same registered offices in London, including Firecrest technologies, Emerdata and six SCL Group companies including \"SCL elections limited\". Nigel Oakes founded SCL Group, which is the parent company of Cambridge Analytica.\nPublicly, SCL Group called itself a \"global election management agency\", \"Politico\" reported it was known for involvement \"in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting\". SCL's involvement in the political world has been primarily in the developing world where it has been used by the military and politicians to study and manipulate public opinion and political will. \"Slate\" writer Sharon Weinberger compared one of SCL's hypothetical test scenarios to fomenting a coup.\n\nCambridge Analytica was founded by conservative businessmen Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer. A minimum of 15 million dollars has been invested into the company by Mercer, according to \"The New York Times\". Bannon's stake in the company was estimated at 1 to 5 million dollars, but he divested his holdings in April 2017 as required by his role as White House Chief Strategist. In March 2018, Jennifer Mercer and Rebekah Anne Mercer became directors of Emerdata limited.\nIn March 2018 it became public by Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, that Cambridge Analytica's first activities where founded on a data set, which its parent company SCL bought 2014 from a company named Global Science Research founded by Aleksandr Kogan who worked as an psychologist at Cambridge.\n\nPer the Associated Press, Data Propria, a data analysis firm launched May 2018, is run by former officials at Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIn July 2018, several former Cambridge Analytica staff launched Auspex International, a company intended to influence politics and society in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nCA's data analysis methods were to a large degree based on the academic work of Michal Kosinski. In 2008, Kosinski had joined the Psychometrics Centre of Cambridge University where he then developed with his colleagues a profiling system using general online data, Facebook-likes, and smartphone data. He showed that with a limited number of \"likes\", people can be analysed better than friends or relatives can do and that individual psychological targeting is a powerful tool to influence people.\n\nCA would collect data on voters using sources such as demographics, consumer behaviour, internet activity, and other public and private sources. According to \"The Guardian\", CA used psychological data derived from millions of Facebook users, largely without users' permission or knowledge. Another source of information was the \"Cruz Crew\" mobile app that tracked physical movements and contacts and according to the Associated Press, invaded personal data more than previous presidential campaign apps.\n\nThe company claimed to use \"data enhancement and audience segmentation techniques\" providing \"psychographic analysis\" for a \"deeper knowledge of the target audience\". The company uses the Big Five model of personality Using what it calls \"behavioral microtargeting\" the company indicates that it can predict \"needs\" of subjects and how these needs may change over time. Services then can be individually targeted for the benefit of its clients from the political arena, governments, and companies providing \"a better and more actionable view of their key audiences.\" According to Sasha Issenberg, CA indicates that it can tell things about an individual he might not even know about himself.\n\nCA derived much of its personality data on online surveys which it conducts on an ongoing basis. For each political client, the firm would narrow voter segments from 32 different personality styles it attributes to every adult in the United States. The personality data would inform the tone of the language used in ad messages or voter contact scripts, while additional data is used to determine voters' stances on particular issues.\n\nThe data would get updated with monthly surveys, asking about political preferences and how people get the information they use to make decisions. It also covered consumer topics about different brands and preferred products, building up an image of how someone shops as much as how they vote.\n\n\"Channel 4 News\", a news programme broadcast by the British public service Channel 4, conducted a four-month investigation into Cambridge Analytica starting in November 2017. An undercover reporter posed as a potential customer for Cambridge Analytica, hoping to help Sri Lankan candidates get elected. Video footage from this operation was published on 19 March 2018. From the footage, Cambridge Analytica executives say they worked on over 200 elections across the world. Alexander Nix was recorded in this investigation, talking \"unguardedly about the company's practices\". Nix said that his company uses honey traps, bribery stings, and prostitutes, for opposition research. For example, Nix offered to discredit political opponents in Sri Lanka with suggestive videos using \"beautiful Ukrainian girls\" and offers of bribes, even if the opponents did not accept the offers. Cambridge Analytica said that the video footage was \"edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent\" the recorded conversations and company's business practices. Nix said that he had \"entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios\", but insisted his company does not engage in entrapment or bribery.\n\nIn the third part of the series, Nix also said that Cambridge Analytica \"ran all the digital campaign\" for Trump. Nix stated they used communications that would be self-destructive, leaving no incriminating evidence. After the news segment was broadcast, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix as chief executive officer. The company also released a statement that the allegations did not represent the ethics of the company, and an independent entity would investigate Nix's statements.\n\nThe investigation also raised questions regarding campaign finance law. During the 2016 election, the company was employed both by Trump's campaign and Robert Mercer's Make America Number 1 Super PAC which supported Trump. While PACs are not limited in the amount of funds they can spend on behalf of a candidate, they are not allowed to coordinate strategy with the campaigns they are supporting. Nix's statements in the recorded video describe how the Trump campaign itself could \"take the high road\" and \"stay clean\", while the negative attacks were handled by the firm and the Super PAC, in a way which makes it \"unattributable, untrackable\". These statements potentially suggested unlawful coordination between Trump's campaign and the PAC, although Cambridge Analytica has denied this.\n\nPolitical scientists have been highly skeptical of claims made by Cambridge Analytica about the effectiveness of its microtargeting of voters (microtargeting refers to the process of \"analyzing data to predict the behavior, interests, and opinions held by specific groups of people and then serving them the messages they're most likely to respond to\"). Political scientists note that access to digital data is not going to provide significantly more information than from public voter databases, and the digital data has limited value over time as the preferences of voters change. Political scientists also note that it is hard to infer political values from personality traits, which means that it is easy to mistarget the messages that are sent to voters with specific personality traits. Research discussed by Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College showed that it is extremely hard to alter voters' preferences because many likely voters are already committed partisans; as a result, it is easier to simply mobilize partisan voters. Tufts University political scientist Eitan Hersh, who has published on microtargeting in campaigns, has expressed strong skepticism about Cambridge Analytica's methods and their purported effectiveness, saying \"Every claim about psychographics etc made by or about [Cambridge Analytica] is BS.\"\n\nIn 2017, CA claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million US citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets. In March 2017, \"The New York Times\" reported that CA had exaggerated its capabilities: \"Cambridge executives now concede that the company never used psychographics in the Trump campaign.\" Trump aides have also disputed CA's role in the campaign, describing it as \"modest\" and noting that none of the company's efforts involved psychographics.\n\nAccording to an aide and consultant for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, their campaign stopped using CA after its psychographic models failed to identify likely Cruz supporters. The Cruz campaign ceased access to all of Cambridge's data after the South Carolina Republican primary on 20 February 2016 when Cruz came in third after Trump and Rubio.\n\nThe use of personal data collected without knowledge or permission to establish sophisticated models of user's personalities raises ethical and privacy issues. CA operated out of the United States; its operations would be illegal in Europe with its stricter privacy laws. While Cruz was outspoken about protecting personal information from the government, his database of CA has been described as \"political-voter surveillance\".\n\nRegarding CA's use of Facebook users, a speaker for CA indicated that these users gave permission when signing up with the provider, while Facebook declared that \"misleading people or misusing information\" is in violation of Facebook's policies. In 2015, Facebook indicated that it was investigating the matter. In March 2018, Facebook announced that it had suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories for failing to delete data on Facebook users that had been improperly collected.\n\nAlexander Nix suggested that data collection and microtargeting benefits the voters – because they receive messages about issues they care about. However, digital rights protection groups raised concerns that private information is collected, stored, and shared while individuals are \"left in the dark about [it]\" and have no control.\n\nSignificant backlash against Facebook came to light in March 2018, resulting in controversy as well as a $37 billion drop in the market capitalization of Facebook, as of 20 March. Due to the scandal of enabling monetization of Facebook personal data, one assessment was that only 41% of Facebook users trust the company. On 26 March, the US Federal Trade Commission announced it is \"conducting an open investigation of Facebook Inc's privacy practices following the disclosure that 50 million users' data got into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\"\n\nIn India, Cambridge Analytica had been used by the two largest political parties, BJP and Congress (INC) to carry out \"in-depth electorate analysis\" and influence voters, including in the 2010 elections to the Bihar Legislative Assembly. 355 Indian Facebook users installed a Cambridge Analytica app, exposing the data of 562,455 users. In addition, Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, alleged that the company has offices and staff in India, and that the Indian National Congress party was a major client. A BBC documentary clip showing a poster of the Indian National Congress in the office of former Cambridge Analytica expert Christopher Wylie went viral in India, sparking accusations that the company was manipulating both mainstream and social media in order to subvert Indian voters away from the Bharatiya Janata Party and towards the INC as part of a neocolonial effort to undermine Indian politics in favor of vested interests. In early 2018 Cambridge Analytica made a 50-page proposal for the INC for both the upcoming 2019 general election in India and their upcoming electoral campaign for the Indian states of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh state elections in 2018.\n\nCA ran campaigns in secret during Kenya's 2013 and 2017 elections. In 2018, a CA employee said that his predecessor at the company had been found dead in his hotel room in Kenya while working on Uhuru Kenyatta's 2013 campaign. The company claimed on its website to have conducted a survey of 47,000 Kenyans during the 2013 elections in order to understand \"key national and local political issues, levels of trust in key politicians, voting behaviours/intentions, and preferred information channels\". According to verified sources, CA worked with 360 Media a company formed by Simon Gicharu founder of Mount Kenya University and Tom Mshindi Editor in Chief of Nation Media Group. Gicharu's 360 developing online campaigns in the 2017 Kenyan elections portraying \"Raila Odinga as a blood-thirsty individual who is also sympathetic to Al-Shabaab and having no development agenda,\" whilst portraying the incumbent President Kenyatta as \"tough on terrorism, and being good for the economy.\"\nAfter the revelations in March 2018, where CA staff boasted of their power in Kenya, opposition figures called for an investigation. Norman Magaya, an official of the National Super Alliance, accused CA and the ruling Jubilee Party of committing a crime and called for an investigation.<ref name=\"BBC_News_3/20/2018\"></ref> The ruling Jubilee Party downplayed CA's role, saying it had hired the firm's parent company, to assist with branding.\n\nIn its Disinformation and 'fake news' inquiry, published on 29 July 2018, the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee noted that it is believed that CA, or its associated companies, worked with the Labour Party in Malta, on the 2013 general election campaign. Several sources claim, including assassinated journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, that CA had close relationships with Henley & Partners who would immediately after the election introduce and run a lucrative Citizenship by Investment Program in Malta. The Maltese Government issued a press release denying the claims and calling the report and its sources \"fake news\". Henley & Partners denied any wrongdoing. According to Henley & Partners, there was never a formal working relationship with CA.\n\nAfter the Facebook scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, \"Forbes\" published that the British news program Channel 4 News had mentioned the existence of proof revealing ties between the PRI and Cambridge Analytica, suggesting a \"modus operandi\" similar to the one in the United States. According to Channel 4 News' Guillermo Galdos, CA worked for the PRI at least until January 2018. An investigation was requested.\n\nIn 2017 the company had reached out to PRI, Mexico's ruling political party, in order to bolster the party's presidential campaign during the largest-ever political elections of 2018. The party decided that it was sufficiently equipped to mess with the election on its own, but still paid Cambridge Analytica to prevent it from working with rival parties.\n\nMany donors to the UK Conservative Party reportedly have connections to the parent company of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCA became involved in the 2016 Brexit referendum supporting \"persuadable\" voters to vote for leaving the European Union. Articles by Carole Cadwalladr in \"The Observer\" and \"Guardian\" newspapers, respectively published in February and May 2017, speculated in detail that CA had influenced both the Brexit/Vote Leave option in the UK's 2016 EU membership referendum and Trump's 2016 US presidential campaign with Robert Mercer's backing of Donald Trump being key. They also discuss the legality of using the social data farmed. CA is pursuing legal action over the claims made in Cadwalladr's articles.\n\nNo campaign contributions, in cash or in kind, by Cambridge Analytica were reported to the UK electoral authorities. Both CA and Leave.eu refused to comment on any donation of services. On 23 March 2018, it was reported that a former employee, Brittany Kaiser, who was the company's former director of business development, has revealed that the company misled the public and MPs over its links with Leave.EU and the analysis of data which had been provided by UKIP. She said she felt she had lied by supporting Cambridge Analytica's company line that it had done \"no paid or unpaid work\" for Leave.EU. \"In my opinion, I was lying. In my opinion I felt like we should say, 'this is exactly what we did'\". The following day, it was reported that the company claimed that it would be able to affect the outcome of the Referendum and that it had produced a 10-page document headed \"Big Data Solutions for the EU Referendum\", claiming it could single out 'Brexiteers' among voters, donors, politicians and journalists.\n\nDW reported in March 2018 that \"Whistleblower Christopher Wylie told UK lawmakers during a committee hearing on Tuesday that a firm linked to Cambridge Analytica helped the official Vote Leave campaign [the official pro-Brexit group headed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove] circumvent campaign financing laws during the Brexit referendum.\"\n\nLaurence Levy, a lawyer with the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, advises Rebekah Mercer, Steve Bannon, and Alexander Nix on the legality of their company, Cambridge Analytica, being involved in U.S. elections. He advises that Nix and any foreign nationals without a green card working for the company must not be involved in any decision making regarding any work the company performs for any clients related to U.S. elections. He further advises Nix to recuse himself from any involvement with the company's U.S. election work because he is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nCA had entered the US market in 2012 (or 2013), and was involved in 44 US congressional, US Senate and state-level elections in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nThe company worked with the John Bolton Super PAC on a major digital and TV campaign focused on senate races in Arkansas, North Carolina and New Hampshire and helped turn out voters for the Republican candidates in those states. Two of the Republican candidates backed by the Bolton Super PAC, Thom Tillis in North Carolina and Tom Cotton in Arkansas, won their Senate bids, while Scott Brown lost in New Hampshire. The PAC ran 15 different spots each in North Carolina and Arkansas and 17 in New Hampshire, mostly online with some targeted directly to households using Dish and DirecTV. All were intended to push Bolton's national security agenda.\n\nCA also supported Thom Tillis's successful campaign to oust Kay Hagan as a senator for North Carolina. The firm was credited for its role in identifying a sizeable cluster of North Carolinians who prioritised foreign affairs, which encouraged Tillis to shift the conversation from state-level debates over education policy to charges that incumbent Kay Hagan had failed to take ISIS's rise seriously. Tillis's campaign and the North Carolina Republican Party paid Cambridge Analytica $345,000 for these services.\n\nCA sent dozens of non-U.S. citizens to provide campaign strategy and messaging advice to Republican candidates in 2014, opening the firm and individuals to prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, for being foreign agents having not registered through the United States Department of Justice as such.\n\nCA's involvement in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries became known in July 2015. As of December 2015, CA claimed to have collected up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans. At that time Robert Mercer was a major supporter of Ted Cruz. The Mercer family funded CA directly and indirectly through several super-PACs as well as through payments via Cruz's campaign.\n\nTed Cruz became an early major client of CA in the 2016 presidential campaign. Just prior to the Iowa caucuses, the Cruz campaign had spent $3 million for CA's services, with additional money coming from allied Super-PACs. After Cruz's win at the Iowa caucus CA was credited with having been able to identify and motivate potential voters. Ultimately the Cruz campaign spent $5.8 million on work by CA.\n\nBen Carson was a second client of CA; his campaign had paid $220,000 for \"data management\" and \"web service\" as reported in October 2015. Marco Rubio's campaign was supported by Optimus Consulting. Meanwhile, the third competitor, Governor John Kasich, was supported by rivalling firm Applecart.\n\nAfter Cruz dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination in May 2016, Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer started to support Trump. In August, it became known that CA followed their allegiance and worked for Trump's presidential campaign. Trump's campaign also worked with digital firm Giles Parscale. In September, the Trump campaign spent $5 million to purchase television advertising. The Trump campaign spent less than $1 million in data work.\n\nIn 2016, the company said that it had not used psychographics in the Trump presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica targeted potential voters with bespoke messages. Cambridge Analytica's data head, Alexander Tayler said, \"When you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3m votes but won the electoral college vote, [t]hat's down to the data and the research.\"\n\nThe head of Cambridge Analytica said he asked WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, for help finding Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails.\n\nOn 18 May 2017, \"Time\" reported that the US Congress was investigating CA in connection with Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. The report alleges that CA may have coordinated the spread of Russian propaganda using its microtargetting capabilities. According to the Trump campaign's digital operations chief, CA worked \"side-by-side\" with representatives from Facebook, Alphabet Inc. and Twitter on Trump's digital campaign activities.\n\nOn 4 August 2017, Michael Flynn, who is under investigation by US counterintelligence for his contacts with Russian officials, amended a public financial filing to reflect that he had served in an advisory role in an agreement with CA during the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nOn 8 October 2017, Brad Parscale, who was the digital media director for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, stated in an interview with Lesley Stahl from CBS News on \"60 Minutes\" that Parscale was able to utilize Facebook advertising to directly target individual voters in swing states. Parscale cited the example in which he was able to target specific universes (audiences) who care about infrastructure and promote Trump and his message to build back up the crumbling American infrastructure. Although he hired Cambridge Analytica to assist with microtargeting, and Cambridge Analytica stated that it was the key to Trump's victory, Parscale denied that he gained assistance from the firm, stating that he thought Cambridge Analytica's use of psychographics doesn't work. He also denied any assistance with links to Russia. According to Parscale, the Clinton Campaign turned down assistance from these platforms.\n\nOn 25 October 2017, Julian Assange said that on Twitter that he had been approached by Cambridge Analytica, but said he had rejected its proposal. Assange's tweet followed a story in \"The Daily Beast\" alleging that Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had proposed a collaboration with Wikileaks to find the 33,000 emails that had been deleted from Clinton's private server. CNN said it had been told by several unnamed sources that Nix intended to turn the Clinton email archive released to the public by the State Department into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee.\n\nOn 14 December 2017, it was revealed that Robert Mueller had requested during the fall of 2017 that Cambridge Analytica turn over the emails of any of its employees who worked on the Trump campaign, as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.\n\nIn 2018, following disclosures that the company had inappropriately acquired the personal information of over 50 million Facebook users while working on Trump's presidential campaign, the \"Times of Israel\" reported that the company had used what Nix had called \"intelligence gathering\" from British and Israeli companies as part of their efforts to influence the election results in Trump's favor.\n\nCambridge Analytica's executives said in 2018 that the company had worked in more than 200 elections around the world, including in Nigeria, the Czech Republic and Argentina.\n\n\n"}

The term was coined by Emil Kraepelin in his 1906 monograph titled \"Über Sprachstörungen im Traume\" (\"On Language Disturbances in Dreams\"). The text discussed various forms of dream speech, outlining 286 examples. Dream speech is not to be confounded with the 'language of dreams', which refers to the visual means of representing thought in dreams.\n\nThree types of dream speech were considered by Kraepelin: disorders of word-selection (also called paraphasias), disorders of discourse (e.g. agrammatisms) and thought disorders. The most frequent occurring form of dream speech is a neologism.\n\nKraepelin studied dream speech because it provided him with clues to the analogous language disturbances of patients with schizophrenia. Still in 1920 he stated that \"dream speech in every detail corresponds to schizophrenic speech disorder.\"\n\nWhile Kraepelin was interested in the psychiatric as well as the psychological aspects of dream speech, modern researchers have been interested in speech production in dreams as illuminating aspects of cognition in the dreaming mind. They have found that during dream speech, Wernicke's area is functioning well, but Broca's area is not, leading to proper grammar but little meaning.\n\nDream speech opens up a new perspective on the psychiatrist Kraepelin, usually seen as the spiritual father of the DSM system of classification of psychiatric diseases, and of biological psychiatry. However Kraepelin, one of the first disciples of Wilhelm Wundt, took a lifelong interest in psychology, and even edited a journal \"Psychologische Arbeiten\". One of the booklets of this journal, a 104-page article on dream speech, appeared early in 1906, before the 105-page monograph was published at the end of 1906.\n\nIn his monograph Kraepelin presented 286 examples of dream speech, mainly his own. After 1906 he continued to collect samples of dream speech until his death in 1926. This time the dream speech specimens were almost exclusively his own and the original hand written dream texts are still available today at the Archive of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich. These new dream speech specimens have been published in 1993 in Heynick (in part in English translation) and in 2006 in the original German, with numerous valuable notes added. The second dream corpus has not been censored and dates are added to the dreams. As Kraepelin in 1906 had been collecting dream speech for more than 20 years, he jotted down his dream speech specimens for more than 40 years, with a scientific viewpoint in mind.\n\nKraepelin's dream speech started during a period (1882–1884) of personal crisis and depression. In 1882 Kraepelin was fired after working only a few weeks at the Leipzig psychiatric clinic and two months later his father died.\n\nAlready in the early years of his career Kraepelin had been confronted with schizophrenic speech disorder - called first \"Sprachverwirrtheit\" then \"schizophrene Sprachverwirrtheit\" and finally Schizophasie - produced by his patients. But —as Kraepelin states— we can hardly study the schizophasia, because we do not know what the patient is trying to express.\n\nHowever using the classical dream-psychosis analogy, he tried to first study dream speech in the hope that this would lead to insights into schizophrenic speech disorder. And so Kraepelin got used to recording his dreams, not to interpret them for personal use as in psychanalysis, but to use them for a scientific study. Kraepelin was not only able to record the deviant speech in his dreams, but also the intended utterance (which was lacking in the deviant speech of his patients, who clearly cannot cross the boundary from psychosis to reality). For example, most neologisms (the deviant utterance) in Kraepelin's dreams have a meaning (the intended utterance).\n\nKraepelin pointed out two fundamental disturbances underlying dream speech: a diminished functioning of the Wernicke area, and a diminished functioning of those frontal areas in which abstract reasoning is localized. Therefore, individual ideas (\"Individualvorstellungen\") get expressed in dreams instead of general ideas. Among these individual ideas he included proper names in their widest sense.\n\nKraepelin's dream speech specimens range from rather simple to extremely intricate. Kraepelin's own analysis is limited in scope. The monograph (available on Google) shows his approach. Several of his dreams can however be analysed in depth. Two examples - one from the second corpus and one from the first and both not analysed by Kraepelin himself - illustrate this.\n\nOn August 13, 1923 Kraepelin jotted down the following example of dream speech:\nThis is, as Kraepelin informs us, an order to the grave digger, named Vi, to bring the coffin for the body during a funeral. Kraepelin notes, that the neologism \"tafalk\" is a shortcut for German \"Katafalk\" (catafalque). Obviously Vi—in the utterance \"Vi, tafalk\"—replaces the syllable Ka.\n\nWhile \"Vi, tafalk!\" is quite easy to analyze, in the same article (p. 1290) the authors demonstrate how the associative paths leading to the complex neologism \"nsens\" (in dream specimen no. 107 of Kraepelin's first corpus) can be reconstructed from its origin \"Firmenschild\" (= \"company sign\").\n\n\"Nsens\" derives from the English word \"nonsense\", once the letters of the word \"one\" have been deleted. Literally \"nsens\" is \"nonsense - one\". This in its turn links to \"crap a ace\" (\"crap\" meaning \"nonsense\", Greek prefix \"a\" meaning \"without\" and \"ace\" meaning \"one\" in dice games). \"Crap a ace\" is derived from a metathesis of \"carapace\", a typical \"Kraepelin\"-word for German \"Schild\" in \"Firmenschild\". In short four association steps link \"Schild\" to \"nsens\":\n\n\"Schild\"= (1) carapace - (2) crap ace= (3) nonsense without one - (4) \"nsens\".\n\nThe chain shows an alternation of conceptual associations (e.g. synonyms) and word form associations (character and sound associations).\n\n(1) and (3) are conceptual associations, (2) and (4) are word form associations.\n\nKraepelin himself — ignorant of the code governing his dream speech — termed \"nsens\" an example of \"syllable combinations jumbled in a completely arbitrary way.\" He thinks \"nsens\" is Russian. Kraepelin's false assertion, according to the authors, originates from the associative network in his dreaming brain during the production of \"nsens\". It is Russian \"krepkea\" (\"крепкая\" ['krep.kə.jə]), meaning \"firm\" and so an association to the first part of \"Firmenschild\", that provokes the transformation of \"carapace\" to \"crap a ace\". \"Krepkea\" as well as \"crap\" are \"Kraepelin\"-words.\n\nIn terms of cryptography (1) and (3) are code-type associations, emphasizing meaning, whereas (2) and (4) are cipher-type associations, emphasizing characters (cf. Pincock & Fary, 2007, p. 13).\n\nWords like 'carapace', 'krapkea', and 'crap' constitute the 'Kraepelin' code, a set of words that sound like parts of the proper name Kraepelin and influence/direct associational processes. The key role of the proper name can be explained by referring to the so-called cocktail party effect, which states that during a cocktail party we tune in on our discussion partner, neglecting background noise. However, we notice when someone in the background pronounces our name. This cocktail party effect has been replicated in an experimental set up using the dichotic listening technique. It has been shown that only our proper name tends to break through the attentional barrier, i.e. breaks through amidst other, neglected, sounds offered to the unattended ear. Thus it follows that our proper name is detected even under conditions of low attention. What happens within outer speech during a cocktail-party, likewise occurs within inner speech in dreams. Code words - linked in sound to our proper name - will be detected in the set of potential associations during thinking. The ongoing thinking process will then deviate because code words will act as priming-words, influencing the direction in which associations will go (Engels, 2005, p. 187).\n\nAs Kraepelin likened dream speech to schizophasia, what is the current view on the last disorder? While in the famous debate during the '70s between the linguists Elaine Chaika and Victoria Fromkin on schizophrenic speech, Chaika long held the position that schizophasia was sort of an intermittent aphasia while Fromkin stated that schizophrenic speech errors could also occur in \"normals,\" the debate has now been ended because according to Chaika (1995)\nShe also thinks that\nChaika compares schizophrenic speech errors with intricate speech errors, difficult to analyze. The current Chaika position comes close to Kraepelin's position (1920), who noted that errors as in schizophasia can also occur in normals in dreams.\n\nAt first sight dream speech plays only a marginal role in dream theory. However the important connection of dream and speech is very well illustrated by the following statement of David Foulkes: \"However visual dreaming may seem, it may be planned and regulated by the human speech production system.\" (see e.g. Kilroe, 2001).\n\nRecent research has confirmed one of Kraepelin's fundamental disturbances. In the book The Committee of Sleep, Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett describes examples of dreamed literature—in which the dreamers heard or read words which they awakened later wrote and published. She observes that almost all the examples are of poetry rather than prose or fiction, the only exceptions being one- or several-word phrases such as the Book title \"Vanity Fair\" which came to Thackeray in a dream, or similarly Katherine Mansfield's \"Sun and Moon\". Barrett suggests that the reason poetry fares better in dreams is that grammar seems to be well preserved in dream language while meaning suffers and rhyme and rhythm are more prominent than when awake—all characteristics which benefit poetry but not other forms.\n\nIn other work, Barrett has studied verbatim language in college students' dreams and found them similar in these characteristics—intact grammar, poor meaning, rhythm and rhyme—to the literary examples. She observes that this is suggestive that of the two language centers in the brain, \"Wernicke’s area must not be functioning well\", but Broca's area seems to be as this language resembles that of patients with Wernicke's aphasia. Essentially the same conclusion Kraepelin reached in 1906.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14919963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14919963", "title": "EIAJ-1", "text": "EIAJ-1\n\nEIAJ-1 was a standard for video tape recorders (VTRs) developed by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan with the cooperation and assistance of several Japanese electronics manufacturers in 1969. It was the first standardized format for industrial/non-broadcast VTRs using a Helical scan system employing open reel tape. Previously, each manufacturer of machines in this market used a different proprietary format, with differing tape speeds, scanner drum diameters, bias frequencies, tracking head placement, and so on, although most used 1/2\" wide tape. As a result, video tapes recorded on one make and/or model of VTR could only be interchanged with other machines using that specific format, hampering compatibility. For example, a reel of tape recorded on a Panasonic machine would not play on a Sony machine, and vice versa. The EIAJ-1 standard ended this incompatibility, giving those manufacturers a standardized format, interchangeable with almost all VTRs subsequently brought to market around that time. The format offered black-and-white (and later colour) video recording and playback on 1/2\" magnetic tape on a 7\" diameter open reel, with portable units using smaller 5\" diameter reels.\n\nThe EIAJ-1 standard paved the way for consumer oriented non-professional analog video recording technology to become more affordable and widespread, with many businesses, schools, government agencies, hospitals, and even some consumers adopting the format in the early 1970s. Some of the first public-access television cable stations that started up around that time used EIAJ-1 equipment extensively, due to its portability, low cost, and versatility. The original Sony Portapak, model CV-2000, used a proprietary format, but was later superseded by an EIAJ-1 compatible version, the AV-3400.\n\nWhen EIAJ-1 was standardized, no videocassette recorders had yet been introduced. One of the main drawbacks to the format was the need to carefully thread the end of the tape around the head drum, through a gap between the capstan and pinch roller, and around a variety of guides and tensioners. If the user made any errors in doing this, the machine would malfunction and the tape could become damaged. So, another version, EIAJ-2, was released later on that used a single-reel cartridge (with the take-up reel being built into the VTR) instead of an open take up reel. Otherwise, the recording specifications were exactly the same.\n\nBy 1971, Sony introduced the first successful videocassette system, the U-matic format. The U-Matic system offered many advantages over EIAJ-1, including color recording as standard, stereo sound, and automatic tape threading. However, EIAJ-1 equipment remained popular for a number of years as it was less expensive than U-Matic machines or tape, EIAJ-1 equipment was lighter and more compact, and portable battery operated EIAJ-1 machines with companion video cameras were already available (such as the AV-3400, mentioned above). It wasn't until the mid 1970s that portable U-Matic machines and compatible portable color cameras were introduced.\n\nNeither the EIAJ-1 nor the U-Matic format were ever used in a Camcorder (one piece) camera recorder unit, because of the size and weight of the mechanism involved. The recorder and camera were always separate units, connected by a multi conductor cable. The advent of the camcorder did not occur until the introduction of smaller, lighter cassette formats, such as Betamax and VHS.\n\n"}

She was the first person to study speech therapy from Queensland.\n\nElizabeth Catherine Molphy (later Usher) was born on 16 November 1911 in Lilydale, Victoria. Her father Thomas Molphy, his wife Ella and family moved to Queensland and their daughter, Usher attended Merrimac Primary School and Warwick State High School. Elizabeth won a scholarship to train as a teacher attending the Teacher’s Training College in Brisbane. After taking her license, Elizabeth taught at a number of schools, including Kaimkillenbun, Maclagan, Elbow Valley and Central School, Warwick from 1928 to 1945. She took her teaching licence in elocution. She also took flying lessons at Archerfield before gaining her pilot’s licence in 1936.\n\nDuring World War II, Elizabeth Molphy trained as a signals and cipher officer with the WAAAF and later in rehabilitation services. She became engaged to Leon Lyons, a pilot, but he was killed during the War. At the conclusion of the war, she entered a training course offered by the Victorian Council of Speech Therapists. Within two years she had completed her Licentiate at the Australian College of Speech Therapists, becoming the first Queenslander to study to become a speech therapist.\n\nElizabeth Molphy returned to Warwick, Queensland to live with her parents after completing her course and a position as a speech therapist became available with Dr Basil Stafford’s Psychiatric Clinic, a division of the Brisbane Mental Hospital, in George St, Brisbane. Usher travelled to Brisbane weekly to take on patients at the Psychiatric Clinic and the nearby Spastic Centre (now Cerebral Palsy Alliance).\n\nElizabeth travelled to England in 1952 to undertake continuing education, working as a supply teacher to support this training. She took a Bobath therapy course for the treatment of the Cerebral Palsy. Following her studies, Elizabeth was appointed a speech therapist to the Royal Oxford Hospitals in 1953. While performing her duties, she worked as a therapist at Headington Hill Hall, a hostel for returned soldiers of World War II and the Korean conflict, who had serious injuries and rehabilitation issues. She met Ken Usher at Headington Hil Halll. He was a former soldier who had suffered significant injuries during World War II. After undertaking further training at Syracuse University in New York during 1953-1954, for patients with hearing impairment and other conditions of the larynx, she returned to Oxford, England and married Ken Usher on 31 July 1954. Now taking her married name, Elizabeth Usher worked as a speech therapist with the London Education Authority.\n\nKen and Elizabeth Usher moved back to Australia in 1956 and she became the first speech therapist to work full-time at the Queensland Spastic Centre (Cerebral Palsy Alliance). She also resumed her work at the Psychiatric Centre. She saw patients at the Mater Hospital and Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. The workload was considerable and Usher and three other therapists continued to take on new patients including those at the Subnormal Children’s Centre (now Endeavour Foundation). Usher petitioned for the establishment of a speech therapy course at the University of Queensland, to help provide a facility to train future speech therapists. After a number of years of negotiation, and with the support of the Vice Chancellor, Sir Fred Schonell, a university course was established in 1962. Usher taught part-time as a lecturer in the course. By 1964, the first group of students had completed the diploma and she was promoted to a full-time lecturer. The course was upgraded to a degree program in 1967.\n\nUsher was awarded an honorary Bachelor of Speech Therapy from the University in 1969. She took her B.A. in 1969. She was made Head of the Department and Senior Lecturer from 1971 and Reader in 1973. Usher retired from the University in 1977 as an Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Speech and Hearing. She returned to private practice.\n\n\nUsher was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1990 for her services to persons with communication disabilities.\n\nUsher died on 23 December 1996. A travelling scholarship is awarded in her name to a student undertaking speech therapy studies at the University of Queensland. An annual lecture also commemorates her legacy in the profession. A statue was cast in her honour and resides in the Therapies Building at the University of Queensland.\n\n"}

The theory is that the Gospel of Mark was written first, followed by the Gospel of Matthew and then by the Gospel of Luke. \n\nIt has mainly been advocated by English biblical scholars. It is named for Austin Farrer, who wrote \"On Dispensing With Q\" in 1955, but it has been picked up by other scholars including Michael Goulder and Mark Goodacre. \n\nThe Farrer theory has the advantage of simplicity, as there is no need for hypothetical sources to be created by academics. Instead, advocates of the Farrer theory argue, the Gospel of Mark was used as source material by the author of Matthew. Lastly, Luke used both of the previous gospels as sources for his Gospel.\n\nFarrer set out his argument in an essay \"On dispensing with Q\". He says that the two-source hypothesis, as set out by Dr B H Streeter thirty years earlier, \"wholly depends on the incredibility [i.e., disbelief] of St Luke having read St Matthew's book\", since otherwise the natural assumption would be that one was dependent on the other, rather than that they were both dependent on a further source.\n\nThis assumption could be displaced by, for example, identifying material appearing in both Matthew and Luke that was very different from either of them, which, when extracted, appears to be a work in its own right, with a beginning, middle and end. Neither of these factors are found in Q, as reconstructed by scholars. He also says (writing before the publication of the Gospel of Thomas) that \"we have no reason to believe that documents of the Q type were plentiful\", which would have made the hypothesis that Matthew and Luke drew on one more likely.\n\nNor is it obvious, Farrer says, that a book like Q was likely to be produced as a written manual of the teaching of Christ, since the reconstruction of it requires it to also have significant narrative elements interspersed with the teaching, and to have an interest in symbolism from the Old Testament.\n\nIn his 1955 paper \"On Dispensing with Q\", Austin Farrer made the case that if Luke had been acquainted with the gospel of Matthew, there would be no need to postulate a lost Q gospel. Farrer's case rested on the following points:\n\n\nThe most notable argument for the Farrer hypothesis is that there are many passages where the text of Matthew and Luke agree in making small changes to that of Mark (what is called the double tradition). This would follow naturally if Luke was using Matthew and Mark, but is hard to explain if he is using Mark and Q. Streeter divides these into six groups and finds separate hypotheses for each. \n\nFarrer comments that \"[h]is argument finds its strength in the fewness of the instances for which any one hypothesis needs to be invoked; but the opposing counsel will unkindly point out that the diminution of the instances for each hypothesis is in exact proportion to the multiplication of the hypotheses themselves. One cannot say that Dr. Streeter's plea is incapable of being sustained, but one must concede that it is a plea against apparent evidence\".\n\nGoodacre puts forth an additional argument from \"fatigue\", meaning cases where a derivative passage begins to make changes to its source but fails to sustain them and lapses back into the original version. For example, the parable of the talents is more coherent in Matthew, but less so in Luke, who attempted to increase the number of servants from three to ten. The several instances where this is observed point to Luke using Matthew rather than contrariwise.\n\nFive arguments are given by Streeter for the impossibility of Luke relying on Matthew.\n\n\n\n"}

The term was coined in the early 2000s from the 'sea' of empty asphalt that often accompanies these sites. \"Greyfield\" is a relative neologism as compared to more commonly known terms such as brownfield or greenfield.\n\nThe term has historically been applied to formerly-viable retail and commercial shopping sites (such as regional malls and strip centers) that have suffered from lack of reinvestment and have been \"outclassed\" by larger, better-designed, better-anchored malls or shopping sites. These particular greyfield sites are also referred to as \"dead malls\" or \"ghostboxes\" if the anchor or other major tenants have vacated the premises leaving behind empty shells.\n\nUnlike brownfields, which feature actual or perceived levels of environmental contamination, greyfields typically do not require remediation in order to unlock value to an investor. The hidden value, in many cases, comes from underlying infrastructure (such as plumbing and sewerage, electrical systems, foundations, etc.) the presence of which allows a developer to improve the site efficiently through capital expenditures (sometimes quite minor) that may easily lead to increased rents and greater value. Other important potential qualities include parking, a central location, etc. may also be leveraged in a well-executed redevelopment of the site.\n\nSome greyfields may also be considered favorable to investors because even if they are outclassed or physically in disrepair, they have revenue in place through long- or short-term leases. Greyfields with short-term leases may work well for an investor/developer who has a strategy involving intensive real estate asset management. By actively managing the greyfield in a short-term lease environment, rents may be increased after improvements are made.\n\nThe \"greyfield\" term may also be applied more broadly to urban infill or commercial locations where underuse or outdated (non-retail) uses hamper an otherwise valuable real estate asset. An example would be a formerly industrial waterfront site that is potentially valuable as a mixed use/residential site as it is being encroached upon by residential sprawl, or other economic or redevelopment pressures. In this example, the revitalization of the greyfield may require zoning changes and/or a public-private partnership of some kind to achieve the highest and best use.\n\nIn 2001 the Congress for the New Urbanism coined the term \"greyfield,\" which refers to aging strips of development that once served as vital commercial corridors during the post-World War II suburban exodus but have today fallen on harder times. In contrast to contaminated brownfields and undeveloped greenfields, greyfields refer to \"so-called 'dead malls,' often characterized by the vast empty asphalt parking lots that surround them.\"\n\nThe most conservative calculations in 1999 estimated that there would be no fewer than 203 American greyfield malls with a combined outstanding debt of over $2 billion and projected redevelopment costs of over $11 billion by 2004. In 2001, of the 2,000 American regional malls, it was estimated that nearly 20% were greyfield malls or in danger of becoming one.\n\nThe Central City Mall in San Bernardino, California; the Prestonwood Town Center in Dallas, Texas; the Maple Hill Pavilion in Kalamazoo, Michigan and the Lafayette Plaza in Bridgeport, Connecticut are all examples of greyfields in American cities.\n\nAn average site size of . These sites are both smaller and less connected to the regional transportation system than those housing America's best-performing malls, which average over in size, with freeway visibility and direct ramp access.\n\nLocated in established neighborhoods and shopping districts and on suburban arterials with bus service, many are already bus hubs.\n\nThey have formidable competition; on average, greyfield malls have 2.3 million square feet () million square feet of competing retail space in 22 other centers within . They are often older and smaller than the most successful malls in their region.\n\nConventional renovations will not be sufficient to breathe new life into many properties. A facelift will do little to help. A new anchor store, depending on the center's position in the market, may not do much either.\n\nCritical factors necessary for the redevelopment of a greyfield site include the following:\n\n\nLessons from successful greyfield transformations are based on the case studies of the Paseo Colorado development in Pasadena, California, the City Place development in Long Beach, California, the Belmar development in Lakewood, Colorado, the Downtown Park Forest development in Park Forest, Illinois, the Mizner Park development in Boca Raton, Florida, and the Winter Park Village development in Winter Park, Florida conducted by the Congress for New Urbanism:\n\n"}

{"id": "586611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=586611", "title": "House show", "text": "House show\n\nA house show or live event is a professional wrestling event produced by a major promotion that is not televised, though they can be recorded. Promotions use house shows mainly to cash in on the exposure that they and their wrestlers receive during televised events, as well as to test reactions to matches, wrestlers, and gimmicks that are being considered for the main televised programming.\nHouse shows are often used to promote upcoming televised events, especially pay-per-views, and will then feature matches between wrestlers who are scheduled to work a match at the pay-per-view. This allows them to secure a 'feel' for each other's style and test out specific parts of matches planned for pay-per-view.\n\nFrom the 1950s to late 1980s, most major matches and title changes happened at house shows, largely due to the costs to produce a TV show at the time, plus the lack of more modern technology making it significantly harder to tape a TV show. TV shows were taped in small studios, and featured squash matches, run-ins, and promos which revolved around feuds to be settled at the house show. Some of these big matches later aired, often scheduled \"for TV time remaining\", which usually ran out as the match built to a finish, hopefully making fans regret missing it and buy tickets to the next show. This changed in the 1990s as the formula for TV shows had changed completely by the time, largely due to the advent of \"Monday Night Raw\" and the then-new \"Monday Nitro\" which changed the way TV shows were taped and proved to be a huge success for the WWF. \n\nHouse shows are similar to dark matches with both being untelevised events. The only difference is that dark matches are untelevised matches in TV programs which were already being televised.\n\nHouse shows are also often designed to make the face wrestlers to win most matches, largely to send the crowd home happy. Though, if a heel defends a title, the face may win by disqualification if this is the case.\n\nSince house shows are not televised, promotions do not usually deploy the setup for staging or pyrotechnics used for their television counterparts. In the past, a WWE house show would consist mainly of a ring, essential lighting, and a crowd. In late 2011, WWE invested US$1.5 million in production improvements, which included three LED-lit entrance stages (one for \"Raw\", one for \"SmackDown\" and one backup) featuring a ramp and video display. They also began utilizing the arena's multimedia equipment to play wrestler entrance and promo videos.\n\nBecause house shows are not televised, sometimes controversial things occur during them (although this is rare) which might not happen on a televised show. For example, on May 19, 1996, the \"MSG incident\", which was also a rare example of a shoot, occurred at a house show taped at Madison Square Garden. At the same show, The Bodydonnas lost their WWF Tag Team Championship to The Godwinns.\n\nMost major promotions try to develop their angles only during televised shows and will rarely book a major development (such as a title change) for house shows. If there is a title change, the title usually changes back during the same show or at another show on the loop before another televised event. These changes are usually not mentioned on television and happen more frequently during tours in areas that get shows rarely.\n\nSome notable house show title changes include an August 10, 1987 match where The Rougeau Brothers (Raymond and Jacques) went over the champion Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) to take the WWF Tag Team championship in the Rougeau's home town of Montreal. This change (and the eventual \"decision reversal\") was only ever mentioned during segments taped specifically for and shown in the Montreal market. \n\nA similar incident occurred in 1990 when The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) took the title from the Hart Foundation. During the match a problem with the ring ropes meant the match could not air on television as originally planned, so kayfabe President Jack Tunney \"reversed the decision\" in print media which had reported the change before the decision not to air it was made. The match was not acknowledged on television at the time.\n\nEven rarer is the top title of a promotion changing hands. This has occurred relatively few times, a notable occurrence including Diesel winning the then WWF Championship from Bob Backlund in 1994 at a live event in Madison Square Garden.\n\nOn January 17, 1992, The Mountie beat Bret Hart in Springfield, MA for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. The reason this was done is because Hart was going through contract negotiations. He lost the title two days later to Roddy Piper at the 1992 Royal Rumble.\n\nShawn Michaels won his second Intercontinental title in Albany, NY from Marty Jannetty with help from his debuting bodyguard Diesel on June 6, 1993.\n\nOn May 19, 1995, Razor Ramon beat Jeff Jarrett in a ladder match at the Montreal Forum for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Then Jarrett beat Ramon to regain the belt in a regular match two days later on May 21, in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. Although neither one of these house show matches was taped, the title changes are officially recognized by WWE on its website. On the \"Monday Night Raw\" following the Sunday night match in Trois-Rivieres, Vince McMahon informed the audience about the title changes from that weekend, and they were referenced several times in the weeks that followed on WWF television whenever Jarrett appeared on TV with the championship belt.\n\nHouse show title changes can occur both to test the reaction of the win or as a \"special treat\" for a specific audience. Edge was given his first Intercontinental Championship win over Jeff Jarrett in Toronto to excite the fans in Edge's hometown. As per usual, he dropped the belt back to Jarrett the following evening at Fully Loaded. \n\nOn August 10, 2003 in Des Moines, Iowa, Christian defeated Booker T to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship as Booker had suffered an injury.\n\nOn July 7, 2017, AJ Styles defeated Kevin Owens to win the WWE United States Championship at a house show at Madison Square Garden.\n\nTitle changes at house shows most commonly occur when a promotion is overseas promoting their brand. For example, Nunzio won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship from Juventud Guerrera in Rome on November 15, 2005.\n\nAt a French house show on April 24, 2007, Mickie James pinned Victoria to win Melina's WWE Women's Championship in a triple threat match. Two matches later, Melina had a one on one rematch with James and pinned her to recapture the title after. On its website WWE recognized both title changes, making James a three time Women's Champion and Melina a two-time Women's Champion.\n\nExamples include La Résistance defeating William Regal and Jonathan Coachman (Eugene's Substitute) to win the World Tag Team Championship on January 16, 2005 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nTwo years later, at a house show in Cape Town, South Africa on September 5, 2007, Paul London and Brian Kendrick defeated Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch to win Cade and Murdoch's World Tag Team Championship, but went on to lose the titles back to Cade and Murdoch just three days later at another house show on that South African tour. \n\nThe World Tag Team Championship changed hands again at a house show on December 13, 2008 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, when John Morrison and The Miz defeated CM Punk and Kofi Kingston. \n\nOn January 15, 2012 in Oakland, CA, Air Boom (Evan Bourne) & Kofi Kingston (Air Boom) on the January 15th 2012 dropped the Tag Team Titles to Primo & Epico (due to a suspension to Evan Bourne) at a House Show in Oakland, CA\n\nDue to its 24/7 rule, the Hardcore Championship changed hands a total of 128 times at house shows, making up more than half of its total reigns at 240.\n\nOn April 21, 2016, Samoa Joe defeated Finn Bálor for the NXT Championship at a live event in Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nOn December 3, 2016, Shinsuke Nakamura defeated Samoa Joe for the NXT Championship at a live event in Osaka, Japan.\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling's house shows occasionally featured title changes which were never officially recognized. Recordings of certain house shows were occasionally televised by TBS midweek, including one in which Diamond Dallas Page used his Diamond Cutter finisher on the hosts of the network's \"Dinner and a Movie\".\n\nBooker T and Chris Benoit traded the WCW World Television Championship back-and-forth on several house shows, with Booker (the official champion) always having the title back in time for \"Nitro\".\n\nTerry Funk once defeated Lance Storm for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship in Funk's hometown of Amarillo, Texas; this title change remained unrecognized until the World Wrestling Federation bought out WCW in 2001.\n\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) has also featured title changes at house shows.\n\nOn January 27, 2010 in Cardiff, Wales, when Rob Terry defeated Eric Young to win the TNA Global Championship.\n\nIn September 2010 the TNA X Division Championship changed hands twice at house shows, when first Amazing Red defeated Jay Lethal at a house show in his hometown of New York City on September 23 to win the title and two days later Lethal regained it in Rahway, New Jersey, near his hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey.\n\nOn October 5, 2005 in Springfield, Tennessee, The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas) had to vacate the NWA World Tag Team Championship after a match with Cassidy Riley and Eric Young. \n\nOn February 23, 2014 in Morgantown, West Virginia, The Wolves (Eddie Edwards and Davey Richards) defeated The BroMans (Robbie E and Jessie Godderz) to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship for the first time.\n\n"}

Arguably, this was true of the Roman Empire, which was strong and effective in the first and early second centuries CE, despite a few setbacks (Germany in 9CE; Scotland in the 80s CE) but lost territories (e.g. Dacia and Mesopotamia) after that and could not keep the Saxons, Huns and other 'barbarians' out in the 4th and 5th centuries. \n\nClearly, this was true of the Napoleonic Empire, which made rapid gains by conquest in the first decade after Napoleon became dictator of France, but became over-extended militarily when it attempted to conquer Russia in 1812. Likewise the German reich in 1942.\n\nThe idea was popularised by Yale University historian Paul Kennedy in his 1987 book \"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\".\n\nPaul Kennedy's view has been criticised from many directions, including the postmodern historiographer Hayden White, economic historian Niall Ferguson and from Marxist writers such as Perry Anderson and Alex Callinicos.\n\n"}
{"id": "15907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15907", "title": "Jabberwocky", "text": "Jabberwocky\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" is a nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll about the killing of a creature named \"the Jabberwock\". It was included in his 1871 novel \"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\", the sequel to \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". The book tells of Alice's adventures within the back-to-front world of Looking-Glass Land.\n\nIn an early scene in which she first encounters the chess piece characters White King and White Queen, Alice finds a book written in a seemingly unintelligible language. Realizing that she is travelling through an inverted world, she recognises that the verses on the pages are written in mirror-writing. She holds a mirror to one of the poems and reads the reflected verse of \"Jabberwocky\". She finds the nonsense verse as puzzling as the odd land she has passed into, later revealed as a dreamscape.\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" is considered one of the greatest nonsense poems written in English. Its playful, whimsical language has given English nonsense words and neologisms such as \"galumphing\" and \"chortle\".\n\nA decade before the publication of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and the sequel \"Through the Looking-Glass\", Carroll wrote the first stanza to what would become \"Jabberwocky\" while in Croft on Tees, close to Darlington, where he lived as a child. It was printed in 1855 in \"Mischmasch\", a periodical he wrote and illustrated for the amusement of his family. The piece was titled \"Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\" and read:\n\n<poem>\nTwas bryllyg, and \"y\" slythy toves\nDid gyre and gymble in \"y\" wabe:\nAll mimsy were \"y\" borogoves;\nAnd \"y\" mome raths outgrabe.\n</poem>\n\nCarroll wrote the letter-combination \"y\" throughout the poem instead of the word \"the\", using the letter Y in place of the letter þ (Thorn) in combination with the superscript E, as in \"þ\", a common abbreviation for the word \"the\" in middle and early modern English, presumably to create a pseudo-archaic impression.\n\nThe rest of the poem was written during Carroll's stay with relatives at Whitburn, near Sunderland. The story may have been partly inspired by the local Sunderland area legend of the Lambton Worm, and the tale of the Sockburn Worm while writing in Croft on Tees and Whitburn in Sockburn.\n\nThe concept of nonsense verse was not original to Carroll, who would have known of chapbooks such as \"The World Turned Upside Down\" and stories such as \"The Great Panjundrum\". Nonsense existed in Shakespeare's work and was well-known in the Brothers Grimm's fairytales, some of which are called lying tales or \"lügenmärchen\". Roger Lancelyn Green suggests that \"Jabberwocky\" is a parody of the old German ballad \"The Shepherd of the Giant Mountains\" in which a shepherd kills a griffin that is attacking his sheep. The ballad had been translated into English in blank verse by Carroll's cousin Menella Bute Smedley in 1846, many years before the appearance of the Alice books. Historian Sean B. Palmer suggests that Carroll was inspired by a section from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", citing the lines: \"The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead/Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets\" from Act I, Scene i.\nJohn Tenniel reluctantly agreed to illustrate the book in 1871, and his illustrations are still the defining images of the poem. The illustration of the Jabberwock may reflect the contemporary Victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of palaeontology and geology. Stephen Prickett notes that in the context of Darwin and Mantell's publications and vast exhibitions of dinosaurs, such as those at the Crystal Palace from 1854, it is unsurprising that Tenniel gave the Jabberwock \"the leathery wings of a pterodactyl and the long scaly neck and tail of a sauropod.\"\n\nMany of the words in the poem are playful nonce words of Carroll's own invention, without intended explicit meaning. When Alice has finished reading the poem she gives her impressions:\n\n\"It seems very pretty,\" she said when she had finished it, \"but it's rather hard to understand!\" (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) \"Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate.\"\n\nThis may reflect Carroll's intention for his readership; the poem is, after all, part of a dream. In later writings he discussed some of his lexicon, commenting that he did not know the specific meanings or sources of some of the words; the linguistic ambiguity and uncertainty throughout both the book and the poem may largely be the point.\n\nIn \"Through the Looking-Glass\", the character of Humpty Dumpty, in response to Alice's request, explains to her the non-sense words from the first stanza of the poem; however, Carroll's personal commentary on several of the words differ from Humpty's. For example, following the poem, a \"rath\" is described by Humpty as \"a sort of green pig\". Carroll's notes for the original in \"Mischmasch\" suggest a \"rath\" is \"a species of Badger\" that \"lived chiefly on cheese\" and had smooth white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag. The appendices to certain \"Looking Glass\" editions, however, state that the creature is \"a species of land turtle\" that lived on swallows and oysters. Later critics added their own interpretations of the lexicon, often without reference to Carroll's own contextual commentary. An extended analysis of the poem and Carroll's commentary is given in the book \"The Annotated Alice\" by Martin Gardner.\n\nIn 1868 Carroll asked his publishers, Macmillan, \"Have you any means, or can you find any, for printing a page or two in the next volume of Alice in reverse?\" It may be that Carroll was wanting to print the whole poem in mirror writing. Macmillan responded that it would cost a great deal more to do, and this may have dissuaded him.\n\nIn the author's note to the Christmas 1896 edition of \"Through the Looking-Glass\" Carroll writes, \"The new words, in the poem Jabberwocky, have given rise to some differences of opinion as to their pronunciation, so it may be well to give instructions on \"that\" point also. Pronounce 'slithy' as if it were the two words, 'sly, thee': make the 'g' \"hard\" in 'gyre' and 'gimble': and pronounce 'rath' to rhyme with 'bath.'\"\n\nIn the Preface to \"The Hunting of the Snark\", Carroll wrote, \"[Let] me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce \"slithy toves.\" The \"i\" in \"slithy\" is long, as in \"writhe\", and \"toves\" is pronounced so as to rhyme with \"groves.\" Again, the first \"o\" in \"borogoves\" is pronounced like the \"o\" in \"borrow.\" I have heard people try to give it the sound of the \"o\" in \"worry.\" Such is Human Perversity.\"\n\n\nThough the poem contains many nonsensical words, English syntax and poetic forms are observed, such as the quatrain verses, the general ABAB rhyme scheme and the iambic meter. Linguist Peter Lucas believes the \"nonsense\" term is inaccurate. The poem relies on a distortion of sense rather than \"non-sense\", allowing the reader to infer meaning and therefore engage with narrative while lexical allusions swim under the surface of the poem.\n\nMarnie Parsons describes the work as a \"semiotic catastrophe\", arguing that the words create a discernible narrative within the structure of the poem, though the reader cannot know what they symbolise. She argues that Humpty tries, after the recitation, to \"ground\" the unruly multiplicities of meaning with definitions, but cannot succeed as both the book and the poem are playgrounds for the \"carnivalised aspect of language\". Parsons suggests that this is mirrored in the prosody of the poem: in the tussle between the tetrameter in the first three lines of each stanza and trimeter in the last lines, such that one undercuts the other and we are left off balance, like the poem's hero.\n\nCarroll wrote many poem parodies such as \"Twinkle, twinkle little bat\", \"You Are Old, Father William\" and \"How Doth the Little Crocodile?\" Some have become generally better known than the originals on which they are based, and this is certainly the case with \"Jabberwocky\". The poems' successes do not rely on any recognition or association of the poems that they parody. Lucas suggests that the original poems provide a strong container but Carroll's works are famous precisely because of their random, surreal quality. Carroll's grave playfulness has been compared with that of the poet Edward Lear; there are also parallels with the work of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the frequent use of soundplay, alliteration, created-language and portmanteau. Both writers were Carroll's contemporaries.\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" has been translated into numerous languages, as the novel has been translated into 65 languages. The translation might be difficult because the poem holds to English syntax and many of the principal words of the poem are invented. Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the morphology of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, \"'Twas brillig\" becomes \"Il brilgue\". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's lexicon, but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. Douglas Hofstadter noted in his essay \"Translations of Jabberwocky\", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to lubricate) to give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks \"what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps 'huilasse' would be better than 'lubricilleux'? Or does the Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)? \".\n\nHofstadter also notes that it makes a great difference whether the poem is translated in isolation or as part of a translation of the novel. In the latter case the translator must, through Humpty Dumpty, supply explanations of the invented words. But, he suggests, \"even in this pathologically difficult case of translation, there seems to be some rough equivalence obtainable, a kind of rough isomorphism, partly global, partly local, between the brains of all the readers\".\n\nIn 1967, D.G. Orlovskaya wrote a popular Russian translation of \"Jabberwocky\" entitled \"Barmaglot\" (\"Бармаглот\"). She translated \"Barmaglot\" for \"Jabberwock\", \"Brandashmyg\" for \"Bandersnatch\" while \"myumsiki\" (\"мюмзики\") echoes \"mimsy\". Full translations of \"Jabberwocky\" into French and German can be found in \"The Annotated Alice\" along with a discussion of why some translation decisions were made. Chao Yuen Ren, a Chinese linguist, translated the poem into Chinese by inventing characters to imitate what Rob Gifford of National Public Radio refers to as the \"slithy toves that gyred and gimbled in the wabe of Carroll's original\". Satyajit Ray, a film-maker, translated the work into Bengali and concrete poet Augusto de Campos created a Brazilian Portuguese version. There is also an Arabic translation by Wael Al-Mahdi, and at least two into Serbo-Croatian. Multiple translations into Latin were made within the first weeks of Carroll's original publication. In a 1964 article, M. L. West published two versions of the poem in Ancient Greek that exemplify the respective styles of the epic poets Homer and Nonnus.\n\nSources:\n\nAccording to Chesterton and Green and others, the original purpose of \"Jabberwocky\" was to satirise both pretentious verse and ignorant literary critics. It was designed as verse showing how not to write verse, but eventually became the subject of pedestrian translation or explanation and incorporated into classroom learning. It has also been interpreted as a parody of contemporary Oxford scholarship and specifically the story of how Benjamin Jowett, the notoriously agnostic Professor of Greek at Oxford, and Master of Balliol, came to sign the \"Thirty-Nine Articles\", as an Anglican statement of faith, to save his job. The transformation of audience perception from satire to seriousness was in a large part predicted by G. K. Chesterton, who wrote in 1932, \"Poor, poor, little Alice! She has not only been caught and made to do lessons; she has been forced to inflict lessons on others.\"\n\nIt is often now cited as one of the greatest nonsense poems written in the English language, the source for countless parodies and tributes. In most cases the writers have changed the nonsense words into words relating to the parodied subject, as in Frank Jacobs's \"If Lewis Carroll Were a Hollywood Press Agent in the Thirties\" in \"Mad for Better or Verse\". Other writers use the poem as a form, much like a sonnet, and create their own words for it as in \"Strunklemiss\" by S. K. Azoulay or the poem \"Oh Freddled Gruntbuggly\" recited by Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz in Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", a book which contains numerous other references and homages to Carroll's work.\n\n<poem>\nOh freddled gruntbuggly thy micturations are to me\nAs plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.\nGroop I implore thee my foonting turlingdromes\nAnd hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,\nOr I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my\nblurglecruncheon, see if I don't!\n</poem>\n\nSome of the words that Carroll created, such as \"chortled\" and \"galumphing\", have entered the English language and are listed in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". The word \"jabberwocky\" itself has come to refer to nonsense language.\n\nIn American Sign Language, Eric Malzkuhn invented the sign for \"chortled\" and it subsequently, and unintentionally, caught on and became a part of American Sign Language's lexicon as well.\n\nA song called \"Beware the Jabberwock\" was written for Disney's \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1951). The British group Boeing Duveen and The Beautiful Soup released a single (1968) called \"Jabberwock\" based on the poem.\n\nThe poem was a source of inspiration for Jan Švankmajer's 1971 short film \"Jabberwocky\", and Terry Gilliam's 1977 film of the same name. In 1972, the American composer Sam Pottle put the poem to music. The stage musical \"Jabberwocky\" (1973) by Andrew Kay, Malcolm Middleton and Peter Phillips, follows the basic plot of the poem.\n\nThe Jabberwock is a central character in Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010), voiced by Christopher Lee. An abridged version of the poem is spoken by the Mad Hatter (played by Johnny Depp).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The original Jargon File was a collection of terms from technical cultures such as the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL) and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities, including Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Carnegie Mellon University, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. It was published in paperback form in 1983 as The Hacker's Dictionary (edited by Guy Steele), revised in 1991 as The New Hacker's Dictionary (ed. Eric S. Raymond; third edition published 1996).\n\nThe Jargon File (referred to here as \"Jargon-1\" or \"the File\") was made by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975. From that time until the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was named \"AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC]\" (\"[UP,DOC]\" was a system directory for \"User Program DOCumentation\" on the WAITS operating system). Some terms, such as \"frob\", \"foo\" and \"mung\" are believed to date back to the early 1950s from the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and documented in the 1959 \"Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" compiled by Peter Samson. The revisions of Jargon-1 were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered \"version 1\". Note that it was always called \"AIWORD\" or \"the Jargon file\", never \"the File\"; the latter term was coined by Eric Raymond.\n\nIn 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on the SAIL computer, FTPed a copy of the File to the MIT AI Lab. He noticed that it was hardly restricted to \"AI words\" and so stored the file on his directory, named as \"AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON\" (\"AI\" lab computer, directory \"MRC\", file \"SAIL JARGON\").\n\nRaphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic resynchronizations).\n\nThe File expanded by fits and starts until 1983. Richard Stallman was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and ITS-related coinages. The Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) was named to distinguish it from another early MIT computer operating system, The Compatible Timesharing System.\n\nIn 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of the File published in Stewart Brand's \"CoEvolution Quarterly\" (issue 29, pages 26–35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele (including a couple of Steele's Crunchly cartoons). This appears to have been the File's first paper publication.\n\nA late version of Jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as \"The Hacker's Dictionary\" (Harper & Row CN 1082, ). It included all of Steele's Crunchly cartoons. The other Jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and Mark Crispin) contributed to this revision, as did Stallman and Geoff Goodfellow. This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as \"Steele-1983\" and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors.\n\nShortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively stopped growing and changing. Originally, this was due to a desire to freeze the file temporarily to ease the production of Steele-1983, but external conditions caused the \"temporary\" freeze to become permanent.\n\nThe AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported hardware and associated proprietary software instead of homebrew whenever possible. At MIT, most AI work had turned to dedicated Lisp machines. At the same time, the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in Massachusetts and out west in Silicon Valley. The startups built Lisp machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a TWENEX system rather than a host for the AI hackers' beloved ITS.\n\nThe Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although the SAIL computer continued as a computer science department resource until 1991. Stanford became a major TWENEX site, at one point operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems, but by the mid-1980s, most of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD Unix standard.\n\nIn May 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the File were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at DEC. The File's compilers, already dispersed, moved on to other things. Steele-1983 was partly a monument to what its authors thought was a dying tradition; no one involved realized at the time just how wide its influence was to be.\n\nAs mentioned in some editions:\nA new revision was begun in 1990, which contained nearly the entire text of a late version of Jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after consultation with the editors of Steele-1983). It merged in about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and a very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now only of historical interest.\n\nThe new version cast a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim was to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all of the technical computing cultures in which the true hacker-nature is manifested. More than half of the entries now derived from Usenet and represent jargon then current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts were made to collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC programmers, Amiga fans, Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe world.\n\nEric Raymond maintained the new File with assistance from Guy Steele, and is the credited editor of the print version of it, \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\" (published by MIT Press in 1991); hereafter Raymond-1991. Some of the changes made under his watch were controversial; early critics accused Raymond of unfairly changing the file's focus to the Unix hacker culture instead of the older hacker cultures where the Jargon File originated. Raymond has responded by saying that the nature of hacking had changed and the Jargon File should report on hacker culture, and not attempt to enshrine it. After the second edition of \"NHD\" (MIT Press, 1993; hereafter Raymond-1993), Raymond was accused of adding terms reflecting his own politics and vocabulary, even though he says that entries to be added are checked to make sure that they are in live use, not \"just the private coinage of one or two people\".\n\nThe Raymond version was revised again, to include terminology from the nascent subculture of the public Internet and the World Wide Web, and published by MIT Press as \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\", Third Edition, in 1996 (hereafter Raymond-1996).\n\n, no updates have been made to the official Jargon File since 2003. A volunteer editor produced two updates, reflecting later influences (mostly excoriated) from text messaging language, LOLspeak, and Internet slang in general; the last was produced in January 2012.\n\nDespite its tongue-in-cheek approach, multiple other style guides and similar works have cited \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\" as a reference, and even recommended following some of its \"hackish\" best practices. The Oxford English Dictionary has used the \"NHD\" as a source for computer-related neologisms. \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", the leading American academic and book-publishing style guide, beginning with its 15th edition (2003) explicitly defers, for \"computer writing\", to the quotation punctuation style \"logical quotation\" recommended by the essay \"Hacker Writing Style\" in \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\" (and cites \"NHD\" for nothing else). The 16th edition (2010, and the current issue ) does likewise. The \"National Geographic Style Manual\" lists \"NHD\" among only 8 specialized dictionaries, out of 22 total sources, on which it is based. That manual is the house style of NGS publications, and has been available online for public browsing since 1995. The \"NGSM\" does not specify what, in particular, it drew from the \"NHD\" or any other source.\n\nAside from these guides and the \"Encyclopedia of New Media\", the Jargon file, especially in print form, is frequently cited for both its definitions and its essays, by books and other works on hacker history, cyberpunk subculture, computer jargon and online style, and the rise of the Internet as a public medium, in works as diverse as the 20th edition of \"A Bibliography of Literary Theory, Criticism and Philology\" edited by José Ángel García Landa (2015); \"Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age\" by Constance Hale and Jessie Scanlon of \"Wired\" magazine (1999); \"Transhumanism: The History of a Dangerous Idea\" by David Livingstone (2015); Mark Dery's \"Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture\" (1994) and \"Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century\" (2007); \"Beyond Cyberpunk! A Do-it-yourself Guide to the Future\" by Gareth Branwyn and Peter Sugarman (1991); and numerous others.\n\n\"Time\" magazine used \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\" (Raymond-1993) as the basis for an article about online culture in the November 1995 inaugural edition of the \"Time Digital\" department. \"NHD\" was cited by name on the front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\". Upon the release of the second edition, \"Newsweek\" used it as a primary source, and quoted entries in a sidebar, for a major article on the Internet and its history. The MTV show \"This Week in Rock\" used excerpts from the Jargon File in its \"CyberStuff\" segments. \"Computing Reviews\" used one of the Jargon File's definitions on its December 1991 cover.\n\nOn October 23, 2003, \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\" was used in a legal case. SCO Group cited the Raymond-1996 definition of \"FUD\" (fear, uncertainty and doubt), which dwelt on questionable IBM business practices, in a legal filing in the civil lawsuit \"SCO Group, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp.\". (In response, Raymond added SCO to the entry in a revised copy of the \"Jargon File\", feeling that SCO's own practices deserved similar criticism.)\n\nThe book is particularly noted for helping (or at least trying) to preserve the distinction between a hacker (a consummate programmer) and a cracker (a computer criminal); even though not reviewing the book in detail, both the \"London Review of Books\" and \"MIT Technology Review\" remarked on it in this regard. In a substantial entry on the work, the \"Encyclopedia of New Media\" by Steve Jones (2002) observed that this defense of the term \"hacker\" was a motivating factor for both Steele's and Raymond's print editions:\n\n\"PC Magazine\" in 1984, stated that \"The Hacker's Dictionary\" was superior to most other computer-humor books, and noted its authenticity to \"hard-core programmers' conversations\", especially slang from MIT and Stanford. Reviews quoted by the publisher include: William Safire of \"New York Times\" referring to the Raymond-1991 \"NHD\" as a \"sprightly lexicon\" and recommending it as a nerdy gift that holiday season (this reappeared in his \"On Language\" column again in mid-October 1992); Hugh Kenner in \"Byte\" suggesting that it was so engaging that one's reading of it should be \"severely timed if you hope to get any work done\"; and \"Mondo 2000\" describing it as \"slippery, elastic fun with language\", as well as \"not only a useful guidebook to very much un-official technical terms and street tech slang, but also a de facto ethnography of the early years of the hacker culture.\" Positive reviews were also published in academic as well as computer-industry publications, including \"IEEE Spectrum\", \"New Scientist\", \"PC Magazine\", \"PC World\", \"Science\", and (repeatedly) \"Wired\".\n\nUS game designer Steve Jackson, writing for \"bOING bOING\" magazine in its pre-blog, print days, described \"NHD\"'s essay \"A Portrait of J. Random Hacker\" as \"a wonderfully accurate pseudo-demographic description of the people who make up the hacker culture.\" He was nevertheless critical of Raymond's tendency to editorialize, even \"flame\", and of the Steele cartoons, which Jackson described as \"sophomoric, and embarrassingly out of place beside the dry and sophisticated humor of the text.\" He wound down his review with some rhetorical questions: \"where else will you find, for instance, that one attoparsec per microfortnight is approximately equal to one inch per second? Or an example of the canonical use of \"canonical\"? Or a definition like 'A cuspy but bogus raving story about N random broken people'?\"\n\nThe third print edition garnered additional coverage, in the usual places like \"Wired\" (August 1996), and even in mainstream venues like \"People\" magazine (October 21, 1996).\n\n\n"}

At 16, he began to broadcast football matches for Antena 3 Radio. He also collaborated on the sow \"Arús con leche\", directed by his brother-in-law Alfonso Arús. From 1990 to 1995 he broadcast football matches, both on Radio Club 25 and M80 Radio (on Cadena SER).\n\nIn 1997 he directed and presented Segundos Fuera, on Radio España. There were a multitude of radio sketches, with the voices of the main characters of this country. Something similar would later on the program On the attack, Onda Rambla, where he made an acid review, and humor, on the most important news of the week.\n\nSince 2006 he gas directed and presented the program Atrévete, in Cadena Dial, together with MJ Aledón, Isidro Montalvo, Roberto Alcaraz, Luis Rollán and others. According to the General Media Study (EGM), the Atrévete program was the second fastest growing morning in Spain.\n\nIn 2008 he was awarded the Ondas Award for radio innovation for combining information, humor and entertainment, organizing a cruise during which a live radio was held over the weekend, with musical performances and competitions, with live participation from the listeners, and the coexistence of communicators and artists with the audience.\n\nOn March 7, 8 and 9, 2008, it creates a precedent in the history of Spanish radio by giving all its listeners a Cruise to the Principality of Monaco through the program Atrévete de Cadena Dial. Cruise artists as important as Sergio Dalma, Conchita, Carlos Baute, Merche and Andy and Lucas join the cruise.\n\nIn November 2009, Javier Cárdenas is once again a pioneer with the Cruise of the Daredoes, taking 2,000 boat listeners to Nice over a weekend with artists such as Chenoa, Manuel Carrasco or Effecto Mariposa.\n\nThroughout 2009, the program directed and presented by Javier Cárdenas Atrévete was the only one that grew in all the general EGM media studies among the more than 15,000 programs that exist in Spain. The morning radio program Atrévete, directed and presented by Javier Cárdenas, achieved a record audience in Cadena DIAL in 2009, reaching 960,000 daily listeners, a figure never achieved in the history of the radio network by such renowned professionals like Javier Sardá, Andreu Buenafuente or Alfonso Arús.\n\nOn July 15, 2010, it finally becomes his last appearance on the \"Atrévete\" program of Cadena Dial, coinciding with the end of the season of the program, leaving it with another historical record when placing it, according to the second wave of the EGM 2010, with more than 1,070,000 daily listeners, something not previously achieved by anyone except the Top 40.\n\nIn 2015, he was awarded the \"Antena de Oro\" award for the best radio presenter in the whole of Spain, achievement achieved by having done a remarkable and exceptional work.\n\nHe is currently in the Europa FM chain presenting and directing the morning show Levántate y Cárdenas, along with collaborators such as Jorge Salvador, Sergi Más, Carlos Sobera, and Albert Lesan. According to the last EGM of the year 2010, Levántate y Cárdenas becomes the morning program of the music radios with more growth, increasing a 25% audience, reaching 594,000 listeners a day. But that audience rise was only a harbinger of what would come next. In just a year and a half, the morning of Europe fm is among the most powerful in the country, from the 486 thousand inherited to haunt the million listeners as in its dial chain stage, being the program that grew the most in the Spanish musical radio, as he did in his day in Cadena Dial where they have never repeated the figures that Cardenas left when he left. In the third EGM 2012 \"Rise and Cardenas\" exceeded one million listeners, becoming the program that grew most in the Spanish music radio. Like the weekends where he exceeded 400,000 listeners. During the last 6 consecutive years \" Levántate y Cárdenas\"It has been the radio program with the most increase in radio listeners, with which they have been proclaimed at present, as the absolute leader with the highest Share in all of Spain. Currently it is estimated that the number of listeners for the program \"Levántate y Cárdenas\" during the weekend is around two million.\n\nHe started in the world of television also with his brother- in- law Alfonso Arús in the Força Barça program, which was broadcast in 1989 on TVE2.\n\nIn the 1992 - 1993 season he follows Arús in his passage through Antena 3, and becomes a reporter of the humor program \"Al ataque\". His peculiar interviews, especially to a clairvoyant named Carlos Jesus, who claimed to be the reincarnation of another person and have a parallel existence on another planet, reached great public repercussion and Cárdenas went on to become one of the most famous personalities in the world. television with characters like the lighter boy and Tristanbraker, the ghost hunter.\n\nIt is thanks to this new way of doing journalism, what Cárdenas is worth to be a point of reference in programs like \"Sal y pimienta\" and \"No estamos locos\" between 1994 and 1997 in the regional channels and that same year he returns to TVE to drive, along with Alonso Caparrós and Asunción Embodies the program Videos de Primera becoming the most watched program of the summer on national television.\n\nCárdenas uses a caustic and ironic tone with his interviewees, with which he tries to expose the eccentricities of the character in question. This would be the style that would mark part of his later career, his boastful epithet, helped him to achieve not only good radio rankings and his own prestige, but also embarrassing and embarrassing moments for his guests.\n\nAfter collaborating in La Parodia Nacional (1996 and 1997) and receiving different awards for the best television program on Antena 3 together with Constantino Romero, in 1997 he presented first-rate videos, being one of the most watched during the summer. Later, he participates in the summer space El candelabro (1999), directed by Tinet Rubira for Telecinco together with the children of the prestigious morning program SI Amanece Nos vamos de la Cadena SER. Substituted Jesús Vázquezin the mythical Gente con chispa program (2000 - 2001) becoming once again the leading program of regional television and receiving the prestigious Minuto de Oro award for being the most watched program and Nunca seremos a cult program, both of Telemadrid, and Shortly after it is added to the Martian Chronicles by Javier Sardà. During this stage he directed one of the sections that focused on interviewing, in an acid and even humiliating way, television characters such as Tamara, Paco Porras or Leonardo Dantes.\n\nIn that stage in Telecinco, he recovers the way of doing that he used in the attack, interviewing quirky and sometimes grotesque characters. In this way, he makes famous figures such as Carmen de Mairena, El Pozí or La Pantoja de Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 2005 he was tried in Arona for lack of dignity of a disabled person interviewed. The appeal to the case was not made wait and through the resolution on 01-19-2010 absolution of the case is given to all involved, because before the interview, the aforementioned had given his approval to make use of it what was not It implied no abuse of their rights. In that instance, the court appointed the accusers to pay for the securities that involved the first confrontation. The fight did not end there and the accusing party, imputed to stronger instances, reaching the case to the Constitutional Court where finally, the ruling was in favor of the accusing party, giving the final opinion ofperjury and derision to the interviewee.\n\nAfter finishing Crónicas Marcianas, he collaborated again with his brother Alfonso Arús and his sister Angie Cárdenas on Tan a gustito (2006) on TVE, making challenges with celebrities, such as the one he made with Carlos Baute making a dive with sharks in the aquarium of Barcelona.\n\nIn 2007 he presented the most important gala of the Cadena Dial music awards in Spanish for artists such as Chayanne, Paulina Rubio, Laura Pausini, Carlos Baute, Alejandro Sanz, Miguel Bosé... for Cuatro y Autonómicas.\n\nIn February 2008 he returns to repeat presentation of the gala of the most important awards of music in Spanish with artists such as Gloria Estefan, Juan Luis Guerra, Juanes, The 5th Station, Alejandro Fernández, Chambao...\n\nAlso in February 2008 he went on to direct and present on Localia TV The Eighth Commandment accompanied by Santiago Urrialde, Joaquín Prat Jr., MJ Aledón and Beatriz Jarrín, complemented by the reports of Urrialde himself and Miguel Martín, doing something unprecedented and having 400% more audience than the average of the chain with 90% less national coverage.\n\nIn June 2009, Antena 3 hired Cárdenas to co-present the afternoon program \"Tal cual\" with Cristina Lasvignes. On the third broadcast, he abandoned the program in the middle of the show, renouncing the multimillion-dollar contract he signed, since he did not accept to deal with issues related to the world of the heart. He also declined to present the end of year gala of 2009 in the regional channels.\n\nSince October 2016, he has hosted the daily \"Hora punta\" (\"Rush Hour\") in La 1 of TVE. In July 2018 it was announced that \"Hora punta\" will move to showing one program per week.\n\nIn 1999, he participated in the short film by Aure Roces entitled \"Rondadores Nocturnos 2\".\n\nCárdenas has published the books Benditos seáis todos (2000), in which he narrates his television experiences and the novel Acariciando un sueño (2002) with Martínez Roca.\n\nIn 2004, he writes, directs, produces and stars in the movie FBI: Frikis Wanna Incordiar (2004), which pretended to be an acid critique of certain characters who live off what is known as telebasura, and it was one of the 20 highest-grossing Spanish films of that year (€928098.74) (the ministry) occupying position 19 of the Spanish productions, also being one of the lowest budget (200,000 €), (According to statements by another producer) although it was not in the reviews. This film has the peculiarity of being the first film in which reality and fiction are combined in equal parts. The film was nominated for the Godoy Awards, by itself was nominated in many categories and won in 8 of them (the Godoy Awards are the antithesis of the Goya Awards), Cárdenas won 4 of them.\n\nIn 2004 he recorded his first album: Siéntelo.\n\nIn February 2007 he presented the 2006 Dial Awards of the Cadena Dial radio station from the auditorium of Tenerife, delivering the most important awards of Latin music to Chayanne, Alejandro Sanz, Miguel Bosé, Paulina Rubio, Laura Pausini, Luis Fonsi, David Bisbal, Manuel Carrasco, Diego Martin, Álex Ubago, Yahir, Carlos Baute, David DeMaria, Malú,Nauzet and Antonio Carmona. Retransmitted for Spain by Cuatro y Autonómicas and live for all of Latin America.\n\nIn March 2008 he presented the 2007 Cadena Dial awards gala again from the auditorium of Tenerife for Spain for Cuatro y autonómicas, and live for all of Latin America where he once again presented the most important music awards in Spanish to Gloria Estefan, Juan Luis Guerra, Juanes, The Fifth Station, Chambao and Alejandro Fernandez, Andy & Lucas, David Bustamante, Conchita, Kiko & Shara, Luz Casal, Malú, Merche,Pastora Soler and Shaila Dúrcal.\n\nOn December 5, 2009 Javier Cárdenas presents the prestigious 10-year gala of Rolling Stone magazine, awarding the best artists of Spanish music such as Alejandro Sanz, Miguel Rios, Miguel Bosé, Marta Sánchez, Pereza, Loquillo, Manolo García, Leonor Watling, Macaco, Joan Manuel Serrat, etc.\n\nIn April 2010, the program directed by Javier Cárdenas has managed to pass the million listeners, practically doubling the best results of his previous predecessors. Placing the program Dare among the top 4 with the most audience in its time slot.\n\nIn May 2010, he received the Honorary Professor Diploma from the ESERP Business School, which reads as follows: \"It expires Mr. Javier Cárdenas Pérez and his brilliant career, highlighting his work in the media and his analytical, executive and innovation capacity. journalistic that have enabled it to achieve the highest level of standing and professional projection. it is granted by unanimous agreement of the governing board the corresponding Honorary Professor.\n\nIn 2013, the Spanish Supreme Court condemns him for considering his attitude towards a disabled person interviewed in a TV5 report as burlesque. Despite the fact that, 11 years earlier, the case had been filed without penalty.\n\nIn 2016 he started working on a documentary about close encounters with death. This topic is passionate It is about explaining, aseptically, the experience of being with people who have experienced clinical death and have come back to life. Interview doctors who believe in this type of experience and others who say that everything is the product of imagination.\n\nOn October 26, 2016, he presented the project \"A house, a life\", a campaign that consisted of raffling his house to raise funds with the aim of contributing to the research of Idic15, a little-known disease in medicine.\n\nThe project focused on the study of Mara's disease - a Valencian girl who suffers from the Idic15 syndrome. His father took a degree in medicine to investigate his daughter's illness, and after Cardenas had interviewed the man, he decided to draw his home in favor of the project, to finance a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Valencia.\n\nThe draw, organized by Lotteries State, took place in December 2016. As a result, the campaign has achieved the 123,000 euros needed to fund research idic15.\n\n"}

Pike to help with the teaching of translation techniques.\n\nEach sentence in Kalaba-X has a fixed structure, consisting of three sentence parts: verb, object, subject, or more exactly, predicate (affirmation or assertion of a general status fact or occurring event), object (that indicates or restricts where the action applies or takes place, or allows qualifying it more precisely), subject (any triggering condition under which the fact can occur, and without which the predicate would not have occurred).\n\nUnder such definition, the grammatical structure of other languages can be more easily compared to each other, using Kalaba-X as a formal intermediate language for studying the language semantic (for example, this theoretical model does not define a grammatical difference between a noun and a verb, or between a verb and an adjective, as it is found in most European languages, because most nouns or adjectives of European languages can also be a predicate by themselves).\n\nEach of these three parts, which are linked semantically rather than grammatically, can be modified. By focusing on the semantic rather than the grammatical structure of the source or target language, this constructed language can be used as an intermediate tool for producing better translations, notably between languages that have very different grammatical structures and where the semantic is organized differently into one or more subordinated sentences.\n\nFor example, the English sentence \"This picture is very beautiful.\" would be structured in Kalaba-X as if it were written \"Beautiful very, picture this, me.\" where the subject (me) is explicitly given in Kalaba-X rather than being subjectively implied by the context. Under such translation, the effective semantic of the sentence is \"I (find that) this picture is very beautiful.\" where the author of the sentence is responsible for this affirmation. The English grammar may hide the fact that the \"beautiful\" adjective translates the concept of \"enjoying\", a true verb, so a simpler Kalaba-X sentence would be better \"Enjoy a lot, picture this, me.\" But the analysis does not stop there, because Kalaba-X features no pronouns, i.e. no ambiguous substitutes; a more exact analysis would give \"Enjoy a lot, picture here, speaker.\"\n\nBut other translations would be possible to indicate whether the opinion is personal or admitted more generally, by adding modifiers (considered adjectives in Kalaba-X) to the subject part (considered a noun) to condition the sentence, or to the object part (also considered a noun) to extend the scope of the predicate. Adding more modifiers in Kalaba-X to the initial verb part of such sentence can make the semantic more precise by including various modes (including tense, variability, recurrence, progress, negation...) but also logical composition relations like unions, intersections and exclusions).\n\n"}

It is part of a wider English Creole Language spoken throughout the Caribbean region in the countries of Antigua ad Barbuda, Belize, Montserrat, and Jamaica Saint Kitts and Nevis\n\nThere are subtle differences in the language's usage by different speakers, and islanders often use it in combination with Standard English. The tendency to switch back and forth from Creole to Standard English often seems to correlate with the class status of the speaker. Persons of higher social status tend to switch between Standard English and Creole more readily, due to their more extensive formal education in the English-language school system. Creole usage is more common, and is less similar to Standard English, as speakers descend the socioeconomic ladder.\n\nMany Creole words are derived from English or African origins. The creole was formed when slaves owned by English planters imitated the English of their enslavers but pronounced it with their own inflections. This can be easily seen in phrases such as \"Me nah go,\" meaning \"I am not going,\" or in \"Ent it?,\" presumably a cognate of \"Ain't it?\"\n\nVocabulary is widely influenced by British vocabulary, due to centuries of association with Great Britain. Examples:\n\n\nHowever, in other cases the American form prevails over the British one, due to the islands' close proximity to the United States:\n\n\nBecause of the influx of other Caribbean nationals to Antigua, due to natural migration and to the CSME, Antigua's everyday vocabulary is being influenced by Jamaican Creole, Bajan Creole, Guyanese Creole and Trinidadian Creole. This is even more common among the youth. Examples:\n\n\n\nAntiguan is pronounced very similarly to Jamaican. This has led some to surmise that the slaves of these countries came from the same place in Africa. Below are a few ways in which some language blends are fused or changed completely.\n\n\nAntiguan Creole is used in almost every aspect of life in Antigua. In all schools, during class hours, it is required of students to speak Standard English. This policy is especially exercised in private owned schools. Most media and mainstream communication is written and spoken in Standard English, although Antiguan Creole is sometimes used humorously or as a way of identifying with the local public.\n\nUse of Antiguan Creole varies depending on socio-economic class. In general, the higher and middle classes use it amongst friends and family but switch to Standard English in the public sphere. The lower class tend to use Antiguan Creole in almost every sector of life.\n\n\nI, me = me;\nyou, you (thou, thee) = yu;\nhe, him = he;\nshe, her = she; \nwe, us = ah-we;\nthey, them = dem;\n\nTo form the possessive form of the pronoun add \"fu-\" to the above.

{"id": "30498023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30498023", "title": "Mental toughness", "text": "Mental toughness\n\nMental toughness is a measure of individual resilience and confidence that may predict success in sport, education and the workplace. As a broad concept, it emerged in the context of sports training, in the context of a set of attributes that allow a person to become a better athlete and able to cope difficult training and difficult competitive situations and emerge without losing confidence. In recent decades, the term has been commonly used by coaches, sport psychologists, sports commentators, and business leaders.\n\nThere are several factors as to why a positive mentality or mental toughness is a huge benefactor to success. An elite athlete must be able to handle pressure, have self-belief and avoid any lifestyle distractions. They must have that urge to win and know that they have all the capabilities to do anything they desire. This separate's the good athletes from the elite athletes (Jones et al.,2002). \n\n\"Mental toughness\" is frequently used colloquially to refer to any set of positive attributes that helps a person to cope with difficult situations. Coaches and sport commentators freely use the term mental toughness to describe the mental state of athletes who persevere through difficult sport circumstances to succeed. In support of this, a number of studies have linked mental toughness to sporting success or achievement. However, it is often simply applied as a default explanation for any victory, which is highly problematic as an attribution. Criticisms about the use of this imprecise approach abound (for example, Moran (2012)).\n\nHowever, within the past fifteen years, scientific research has attempted a formal definition of mental toughness as a psychological construct with clear measurement criteria, allowing robust analyses and comparisons to be made.\n\nIn particular, three research teams have produced both a definition and a construct definition for mental toughness:\n\nGraham Jones, Sheldon Hanton, and Declan Connaughton of the United States used personal construct psychology in interviews with elite athletes, as well as elite-level coaches and sport psychologists, to arrive at the following definition of mental toughness:\n\n\nThese same researchers published a second paper in 2007, which provided four dimensions (categories) for mental toughness attributes. One general dimension was outlined: a performer's attitude or mindset (specifically, the performer's focus and self-belief). Three time-specific dimensions were outlined: training, competition, and post-competition. These time-specific dimensions contain attributes of mental toughness (such as handling pressure, handling failure and pushing yourself to your physical limit in training) that pertain to their use at these times.\n\nPeter Clough et al. (2002) proposed a model of mental toughness, conceptualising it more like a personality trait. Their model has four components: confidence; challenge; control and commitment. In initially conceptualising mental toughness and developing the MTQ48 questionnaire measurement tool, the approach taken by Clough et al. (2002) was to combine existing psychological theory and applied sport psychology in an attempt to bridge the gap between research and practice. Clough et al. saw clear comparisons between their emerging mental toughness data and the concept of hardiness, a key individual difference and resistance resource that helps buffer stress and has become an accepted concept in health psychology within the study of the stress-illness relationship. Clough et al. are clear that mental toughness is concept with broad application and should not be limited to the sports domain. They feel that sports specific measures are unlikely to move the field forward in any meaningful ways. The development work relating to their model is fully described and discussed in their book on mental toughness.\n\nDaniel Gucciardi, Sandy Gordon, and James Dimmock of Australia have proposed a different definition and framework of mental toughness, based primarily on their work with Australian footballers. Using personal construct psychology, these authors proposed the following definition of mental toughness:\n\nAlthough this definition was produced through work with Australian footballers, it has been generalized to other sports, including cricket and soccer. This definition conceives of mental toughness as having both reactive \"and\" proactive qualities, meaning that mentally tough players can use mental toughness attributes to help endure and perform well during adverse situations, but can also employ other attributes of mental toughness when the game is going well, to keep them playing at their best.\n\nSome psychologists have argued that a separate, sport-specific definitions of mental toughness should be developed. They have highlighted that the attributes of a mentally tough athlete in one sport may differ greatly from the attributes of a mentally tough athlete in a different sport. Differences have been hypothesized between male and female athletes, as well as between \"team sport\" and \"individual sport\" athletes, but to date, little empirical evidence has shown what these differences are.\n\nSport-specific studies of mental toughness have been conducted in cricket, soccer, gymnastics, and Australian football. \nThese studies have not employed a common framework, although many have used the definition of mental toughness provided by either the Jones et al. study, or the Gucciardi \"et al.\" study.\n\nMany sports focussed studies have employed the Clough model of mental toughness. They have, using samples of athletes, shown a link between toughness, coping, emotional reactivity, psychological skills and performance.\n\nOne of the few published studies that takes mental toughness out of the sporting domain is based on the 4 'C's model. In this study it was shown that senior managers are tougher than their junior colleagues. Clough and his team are working in a number of areas outside of sport – education, health, social as well as occupational to explore the relevance of mental toughness in these areas.\n\nThere is an active debate about whether mental toughness is primarily a developed characteristic, or has a genetic basis. Two studies suggest that foundational processes occur during development that allow a person to build mental toughness throughout life. For instance, a study of American soccer players, parents, and coaches found that parents provide a \"generalized form\" of mental toughness upon which coaches can build a sport-specific form of mental toughness. A similar study suggested that mental toughness development proceeds first through the development of a tough attitude (strong focus and strong self-belief); upon a tough attitude, an athlete learns how to develop mental toughness attributes needed for training, then for competition. Another study examined the developmental experiences of ten super-elite athletes and found that coaches and significant adults played an important role in mental toughness development through all stages of talent development.\n\nConversely, the work of Horsburgh et al. (2009) demonstrates that genetic and non-shared environmental factors contribute to the development of mental toughness (as measured by the MTQ48), and that mental toughness behaves \"in the same manner as virtually every personality trait that has ever been investigated in behavioural genetic study\". In establishing significant relationships with the big five personality factors of Costa and McCrae (1992), these researchers have also provided evidence to support Clough et al.’s conceptualisation of mental toughness. Whilst clearly embracing the importance of genetics, Clough clearly acknowledges that mental toughness can be developed.\n\nMental toughness has been equated with better understood constructs from psychology such as resilience and hardiness. The term resilience is often incorrectly used interchangeably with mental toughness, and researchers have found the two constructs are positively associated with one another. However, psychologists define resilience as a positive adaptive \"process\" of coping with stress and adversity, as opposed to a collection of psychological attributes or personality traits. Hardiness has been suggested as a similar construct to mental toughness. Hardiness has typically been constructed as a personality trait, which is generally seen as stable throughout the lifetime. This differs from the conceptions of mental toughness offered by both Jones et al. and Gucciardi et al. These authors both conceive of mental toughness as unstable, arising in development, fluctuating over time, and varying for an individual performer between different sport and life scenarios. This definitional dilemma plagues the use of the term mental toughness and if mental toughness exists as a valid construct it may on occasion be maladaptive. Evidence to support this contention is derived from a study of overtraining behaviors and mental toughness by Tibbert (2013). She reported that \"the MT attributes of mental self-concept and task familiarity displayed moderate curvilinear correlations with sport-specific recovery scales of the RESTQ-Sport. The curvilinear correlations reflect decreasing recovery at the highest levels of MT. The results suggest that some attributes of MT may relate to increased ability to recover whereas other attributes are associated with lower recovery (p.2-3). Arguably mental toughness is more closely linked with goal fixedness rather than adaptability and a flexible mindset, attributes which are central to resilience.\n\nTwo instruments have been developed and validated since 2009. Gucciardi and colleagues validated the American Football Mental Toughness Inventory (AFMTI), while Sheard and Golby validated the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ). The MTQ48 pre dates these by some seven years. The factor structure of the MTQ48 has been supported by an independent research grouping led by Horsburgh (2009). Dr Lee Crust, University of Lincoln, compared the SMTQ with the MTQ 48 and concluded \"Both instruments appear to tap the core components of MT but the MTQ48 seemingly provides a more comprehensive measure\".\n\nThe MTQ48 questionnaire has demonstrable criterion related, construct and content validity. Reliability has been assessed by numerous independent researchers and it has clearly demonstrable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. All component scales exceed 0.70 and the overall measure has a reliability in excess of 0.90. Nevertheless both the construct validity and the psychometric properties of this test have been questioned by Andersen (2011).\n\nSeveral other instruments have purported to measure mental toughness, but research has called their validity into question. For example, the Performance Profile Inventory (PPI) developed by Jim Loehr used seven subscales to compute a mental toughness score. The Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI) developed by Middleton and colleagues measures mental toughness using twelve subscales and appears to show strong theoretical evidence for its formation. However, construct validation has only been performed with a narrow sample of athletes, leaving its psychometric properties up for debate.\n\n"}
{"id": "2484804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2484804", "title": "Moa Martinson", "text": "Moa Martinson\n\nMoa Martinson, born Helga Maria Swarts sometimes spelt Swartz, (2November 18905August 1964) was one of Sweden's most noted authors of proletarian literature. Her ambition was to change society with her authorship and to portray the conditions of the working class, and also the personal development of women. Her works were about motherhood, love, poverty, politics, religion, urbanization and the hard living conditions of the working-class woman.\n\nMartinson was born on 2November 1890 in Vårdnäs, Linköping Municipality. Her mother was Kristina Swartz (sometimes spelt Christina Schwartz) who served as a maid wherever jobs were available. There are no legal records stating who her father was, but according to researchers Annika Johansson and Bonnie Festin, he was probably Anders Teodor Andersson, a farmhand who served at the Kärr farm in Motala at the same time as Swartz. Since she carried, what in those days was referred to as an illegitimate child, she had to go to her parents home for the birth. Swartz' father, Nils Peter Swartz, was a poor soldier who lived with his wife, Carin Olofsdotter, in a derelict croft in Vårdnäs. On 17February 1891, Swartz sued Andersson for child support at the Motala district court, where two witnesses testified that they had seen her and Andersson in the same bed around the time the child would have been conceived. Andersson failed to appear in court in February as well as on the two following hearings. Swartz finally said that he had gone to America and the proceedings were stayed.\nThe identity of her father was unknown to Martinson her entire life, but her speculations about who it could be were an inspiration for her work. In her book \"Pigmamma\" (\"Maid Mother\") she portrays her mother's situation, pregnant with a married man's child. At one point she thought that her father was a married man, whom her mother had worked for. Her romantic view of her mysterious father decreased as time went by. In her book \"Mor gifter sig\" (\"My Mother Gets Married\"), written twelve years later, it became clear how much Martinson despised her absent father. In \"Fjäderbrevet\" (\"The Feather Letter\"), written another six years later, there is no mentioning of him at all.\n\nDuring the first years of her life, Martinson lived with her paternal grandparents and their youngest daughter Hulda while Swartz worked as a maid or in the textile mills in Norrköping. There are many discrepancies in the timeline of Martinson's early year between official records and her books. These are most likely due to that her stories built on the oral traditions of the family. In 1892, her grandfather became ill and died and her grandmother could no longer take care of Martinson so she went to live with her mother. There is no record of where they lived until 1894, when they moved to Norrköping. Swartz earned very little money. In 1894–1896, she worked at Norrköping's wool weaving mills, where working conditions were extremely bad and wages low. During her early school years, Martinson had a stepfather, Alfred Karlsson, who she described as an alcoholic. He was a sometime statare who worked odd jobs in the countryside outside Norrköping. He married Swartz on 11March 1896, and they had three more daughters, but they all died within days of being born. After the years at the textile mill, the family moved several times to different locations in Östergötland, settling down for a time wherever work was available. This affected Martinson's schooling since they only stayed in one place for a couple of months. Despite this, she left school with high marks after six years in 1903. She was confirmated in 1905 in Risinge Church, Finspång Municipality, after which she got her first job at a farm in Vikbolandet.\n\nIn Martinson's book \"Kvinnor och äppleträd\" (\"Women and Apple Trees\"), which is set in Norrköping, she described the hard and ruthless situation that she and her mother was in during the 1890s. Because of the book, Martinson was accused for denigration by right-wing critics, but Martinson said that what she did was the opposite. The different run-down lodgings the family moved in and out of are described in the books \"Kyrkbröllop\" (\"Church wedding\") and (\"My Mother Gets Married\") as well as in a couple of the short stories in \"Jag möter en diktare\" (\"I meet a poet\").\n\nAt the age of fifteen, she trained to become a pantry chef; at the time, she was the youngest in that profession in Sweden. During the summer of 1906, she worked as a kitchen maid in the main restaurant at the Norrköping Exhibition of Art and Industry. Situated at the top of \"Syltberget\" (\"Sylt Hill\"), the restaurant was accessed by an 80-steps stairway. In \"Kungens rosor\" (\"The King's Roses\"), Martinsson recounts her work in the restaurant and mentions the stairs. The novel got its name from a conversation that she had at the exhibition with King Oscar II of Sweden on 3July 1906. The conversation revolved around flowers, which the King said that he felt had souls. , the stairs remain and have been named \"Moa Martinson's Stairs\".\n\nIn 1906, Martinson moved to Stockholm in the hope of getting a job, but this turned out to be harder than she expected. During the financial depression of 1907–1909, she had to move back to Norrköping. At this time, she followed events related to concerns about the labour market. This period of Martinson's life had a significant impact on her political engagement. She also wrote poems and sent a collection to a notary interested in literature, but her work was rejected. She later described the poems as \"lofty\", since that was how she thought such texts should be written.\n\nIn 1908–1909, Martinson worked as a pantry chef at restaurants and hotels in Sweden. In the winter of 1909, she met Karl Johansson in Ösmo. He was nine years older than her, and was a stone worker who lived with his brother Valfrid and their father Johan Petter in a torp called Johannesdal, in the woods between Ösmo and Sorunda. She became pregnant in March 1909 and Johansson proposed, but Martinson was doubtful about marrying him. Despite this, she and Karl moved to Johannesdal and in her book \"Den osynlige älskaren\" (\"The Invisible Lover\") she wrote about her first year as mother and wife, the hard life in Johannesdal and how she desperately wanted to get away.\n\nIn 1910, her first son Olof was born, and in 1922 she and Johansson were married. The reason she hesitated for such a long time to marry him, was partly due to Johansson's drinking and partly because she did not want to live in the dark forest.\nAfter the birth of Olof, the family soon expanded. In 1911, their second son Tore was born, followed by three more sons: Erik in 1913, Manfred in 1914 and Knut in 1916. The birth of Knut was especially hard, since she had to deliver him all alone on the kitchen floor in the torp. Martinson recounted the birth in \"Kvinnor och äppelträd\", which has been called \"one of Swedish literature's most powerful depictions of a childbirth\".\n\nLife on Johannesdal was poor and hard but the upbringing of her sons was important to Martinson. She was opposed to spanking children and disliked the militant nationalistic romanticism taught in schools at the time.\n\nMartinson's political interest started to develop in 1921, when unemployment in Sweden was higher than ever before, and in 1922 she and Johansson joined the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden where Martinson became very active. To further educate herself, she read the works of authors like Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Émile Zola, Maxim Gorky and Martin Andersen Nexø. Because of her political interest in better pay and conditions for workers and her ability to speak in any context, she was elected to the municipal council in Sorunda where she represented the labour party. She resigned from office in 1926.\nIn November 1922, Martinsson wrote her first article for the syndicalist paper \"Arbetaren\"'s (\"\"The Worker's\") page for women. She continued writing for the paper and in 1923 she had articles published weekly in \"Arbetaren\". In her articles she wrote about how men and women should work together for a better world. She engaged in many debates, especially those involving women's issues.\n\nWith her work for \"Arbetaren\" she developed her writing skills, but even though she often pushed the boundaries in her articles, she went too far in 1924, when she wrote that women and men should receive equal pay for equal work. Quarrels started at the magazine, resulting in Martinson resigning from the paper, but due to her contributions in \"Arbetaren\" she was now known to the public although mostly in syndicalistic circles.\n\nOne author who had significant impact on Martinson was Martin Andersen Näxö. It was the first time she recognized her own experiences in a literary work. She wrote a letter to him, telling him about her own life and also sent an article she had written for \"Arbetaren\". Näxö responded positively, telling her she should write a book about her life. Shortly afterwards Martinson started writing the book \"Pigmamman\" (\"The Maid Mother\"). In 1925, she worked for a new magazine called \"Vi kvinnor\" (\"We women\"), where she contributed with articles, novels and causeries.\n\nIn April 1925, Martinson's two youngest sons, Manfred and Knut, went through the ice and drowned in the lake Styran by the torp and she was devastated. She worked incessantly to keep her grief at bay.\n\nIn September 1925, \"Vi Kvinnor\" was discontinued and soon after Martinson started working for \"Arbetaren\" again. She also worked for the paper \"Brand\" in April 1925, and became part of the political circles in Stockholm. She wrote her first story \"Pigmamma\" (\"Maid Mother\"\") in 1924–25, and it was published as a serial in \"Brand\" in 1927. In June 1926, her first article for \"Arbetarekuriren\" was published and in 1927 her work was published in \"Templar-kuriren\" (\"\"The Templars Courier\"), \"Arbetaren\" and \"Nynäshamns-posten\" (\"The Nynäshamn Post\"\"). In October that year, she was also writing for \"Tidevarvet\" (\"The Epoch\") which was a politically radical magazine for women published by the Fogelstad Citizen School for Women with Elin Wägner as editor. Her first contribution was an article about unemployed men's women. She wrote it under a new signature, Moa, because she did not want the syndicalistic circles she moved in to see that she worked for a liberal magazine. However, her work for \"Tidevarvet\" was mostly novels and stories and her political articles were still published in the syndicalistic press. She had found the name \"Moa\" in the novel \"Jökeln\" (\"Bræen\") by Danish author Johannes V. Jensen, where the character \"Moa\" was described as the first mother of humanity.\n\nIn November 1927, Martinson traveled to Gothenburg at the request of chief editor Welinder at the \"Arbetare-kuriren\". She was hoping to be offered a job at the paper, but instead Welinder wanted her to work as a housemaid for him and do some writing for the magazine in exchange for food and shelter in his house. Martinson turned down the offer. While she was at the editorial office, she met Harry Martinson for the first time. He was a former sailor, now hobo writer who had been published in \"Brand\" and \"Arbetare-kuriren\" so she had heard of him and read some of his works.\n\nShortly after Martinson's return to Johannesdal, her husband was afflicted by a nervous disorder. He started hallucinating and could not eat or sleep. She tried to get him to a doctor but he refused. On 14January 1928, Johansson committed suicide by putting a stick of dynamite in his mouth and lighting the fuse. By then, Martinson had considered divorcing him for a long time since theirs had not been an easy marriage. After Johansson's death her economic situation was difficult. Martinson's friends in Stockholm started a fund-raising and manage to collect SEK 3,300 to ease her financial situation. Having lost two sons and one husband, she became very depressed. In March 1928, she took a typing course at the Fogelstad Citizen School for Women and when she left the school it was as \"Moa\".\nDuring her stay at Fogelstad, she received a letter from Harry Martinson, who asked if he could come and stay for a while at the torp in Johannesdal so he could work. He arrived in the summer of 1928.\n\nDuring the summer of 1928, Martinson and Harry fell in love. However, in 1928–1929 she became more depressed and in March 1929, she was hospitalized at Södertälje hospital. During Martinson's stay in the hospital, Harry lived at Johannesdal and they communicated through letters. On 3October 1929, they got married. Shortly thereafter, in May 1930, Harry was diagnosed with tuberculosis leaving Martinson devastated.\nThe couple had very little money so in 1932, Martinson sent a draft called \"En man byggde\" (\"A man built\") to publisher Tor Bonnier. She continued to develop the draft during the following year and when it was finalized into a book, the title was changed to \"Kvinnor och Äppleträd\". It was published in 1933, and the author was named as \"Moa Martinson\". Because of the timing and the theme, the book was categorized as \"modernist literature\". This became Martinson's literary debut and it gained a lot of attention. Simultaneously, Harry was diagnosed with neurosis and Martinson was deeply concerned for him. He was fourteen years younger than she, and their marriage had not been easy. As writers, they also had very different styles. While Martinson was characterized as an unpolished realist, Harry was a refined modernist.\n\nDuring the winter of 1933, their financial situation improved and they rented an apartment in Saltsjöbaden in the hope of solving their marriage problems. At the beginning of 1934 Harry suffered from depression. Up until then, he had never stayed in one place for such a long time as he had done with Martinson at Johannesdal. He started to leave the apartment now and then without any explanation of why or where he was going, and would be gone for days. Harry's friends blamed Martinson for his disappearance, and there were even those who believed that she was to blame for both his physical and mental pain. Not knowing where her husband was, Martinson soon became desperate with despair and jealousy. She even hired a private detective, but when this yielded nothing, she soon gave up. Unknown to Martinson, Harry had started to see a new woman during his time away from home. According to Engman, the name of the woman was Karin L., and another source, Söderberg, speaks of a love affair with poet Karin Boye and several other women. In the summer of 1934, Harry confessed that he had been seeing another woman but said that he had ended the affair. Martinson became furious, but she forgave him.\n\nHowever, Harry's affair with Karin was not over and the same summer they traveled to Tällberg in Dalarna. Harry told Martinson that he needed to be alone and that it would be good for them to be apart for a while. After a couple of weeks, Harry grew tired of Karin and returned to Johannesdal. During the last years of their marriage, he continued to wander off now and then from Martinson and Johannesdal.\n\nOn 6June 1934, Harry abruptly left Martinson and the house in Johannesdal and took to the road again, leaving behind the manuscript for \"Flowering Nettle\" (\"Nässlorna blomma\"). When he had been gone ten days, Martinson posted a personal telegram on the Swedish radio urging him to come home. With the announcement, Harry's flight became public and the story circulated in the newspapers. The couple kept in contact indirectly through their publishers and friends. On 2August, Martinsson wrote to Harry that she was going to commit suicide and that the manuscript was going to follow her to the grave. She had buried the manuscript in the woods. The letter reached Harry while he worked his passage aboard a ship to Rottedam. A week later, he was back home in Johannesdal and he, Martinson and one of their sons dug up the manuscript.\n\nIn August 1934, the couple were invited to the first All Union Congress of Soviet Writers in Moscow as part of the Swedish delegation. Gorky became the first chairman of the congress during which the new doctrine of Socialist realism was formed. Martinson became fascinated by the communist society, while Harry was appalled by Stalin's cult of personality.\n\nIn the autumn of 1935, the tension between Martinson and Harry seemed to have disappeared. She was working on \"Mor gifter sig\". In 1937, she decided to leave the Bonnier publishing company. Instead she joined the Tidens publisher which was owned by the Swedish social democratic party. Martinson decided to leave because she had been having disagreements with Tor Bonnier since 1934. He was one of the Bonnier-founder's two grandsons who jointly ran the company at the time. Her choice of Tidens was also partly due to political reasons. Starting with a collection of poems called \"Motsols\" (\"Counterclockwise\"), Martinson's works were now published by Tidens. She had been working on \"Motsols\" for ten years. It consisted of poems about politics, love and nature.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Martinson experienced severe stomach pains. Despite several diagnoses made by different doctors, no remedy could be found and the pain continued. In June 1937, she was hospitalized at the Södertälje hospital where it was discovered that buckshots had accumulated in her appendix. She had an operation on 16June and during her stay at the hospital, she and Harry kept in contact through letters. Harry's were love letters, while Martinson still found it difficult to trust him after his extramarital affairs. Her letters were not as affectionate as his and their relationship was crumbling. On 8February 1939, Harry experienced pain in one of his knees and was hospitalized. He stayed in the hospital during spring and was discharged on 13June, after which he went to Stockholm and stayed with friends. He broke contact with Martinson and after Midsummer 1939, he filed for divorce and never returned to her or Johannesdal. They were granted legal separation on 4March 1940, and divorced in 1941. By then Harry was already engaged to his second wife Ingrid Lagercrantz. They were married until Harry committed suicide on 11February 1978 at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm by cutting his stomach open with a pair of scissors in what has been described as a \"hara-kiri-like manner\", due to a depression following a controversy regarding the Nobel Prize in Literature he received in 1974.\n\nThe marriage between Martinson and Harry is recounted in the memoirs \"Tröskeln\" (\"The Threshold\") (1982) by their friend Swedish writer Ivar Lo-Johansson. She also relied on Lo-Johansson to deliver messages to Harry when he was out on his wanderings and his whereabouts were unknown to her.\n\nOver six years Martinson had published eight books and had gained most critics' respect. In September 1939, World War II broke out, which she saw as the biggest threat to the working class. In her opinion, the non-socialist ruling countries were sending out workers to fight for values they did not share. When it came to Soviet participation in the war, Martinson had a different opinion and believed that Russian workers were defending their revolution.\n\nIn order to make more money and avoid loneliness Martinson entered a new area, the film industry. She had help from her friend Naima Wifstrand, who was an actress. Martinson wrote a lengthy screenplay that she sent to director Per Lindberg, who became interested. She proposed that they would contact AB Svensk Filmindustri (SF). However, Martinson's ambitions were too big and when she demanded an advance and an answer straight away, SF showed no interest.\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, she met Karl Gunnarsson, whom she had first encountered in 1910 when she worked as a pantry chef at the Elfkarleö Hotel, south of Gävle. Gunnarsson was a writer too and the meeting with him reminded Martinson of her youth during the 1910s and the move to Johannesdal. Her memories were given shape in a love novel called \"Den osynlige älskaren\" (\"The Invisible Lover\").\n\nDuring the 1940s, Martinson became known in Sweden as \"the Mother of the People\". Her books were reaching a wide audience and she now had readers who could identify with the environment she was portraying, instead of people being shocked by her naturalistic scenes. She wrote diligently and had causerie and debate articles published in many daily and weekly papers. She was also frequently hired to give lectures and traveled the country on different tours. In 1944, she made her radio debut. Because of her strong personality, what she said and did caused attention, and she became a role model for many women in Sweden and most of all for women in the working class.\n\nIn November 1954, Martinson's mother Kristina Swartz died at the age of 83. Their relationship had been very strong, and Martinson's mother had been a big influence and inspiration for her work. In \"My Mother Gets Married\", she characterized Swartz as her best and most trusted friend. At that time, Martinson's literary reputation was low as it had decreased throughout the years. When her health became worse in the 60s, she stopped writing. However, despite her low reputation as a writer, Martinson still meant a lot to working class women. Even though her health was deteriorating, she still enjoyed debating and never stopped expressing her feelings.\n\nOn 5August 1964, Martinson died at 73 years of age in Sorunda, Strängnäs. She is buried at Sorunda Church.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Martinson became a role model for female writers during the femimist movement in the Nordic countries. Earlier, during the 1960s, she had been labeled \"the cheerful chronicler of misery\" by Swedish author Erik Hjalmar Linder.\n\nIn 1989, a literary award named after Martinson was instituted by the Workers' Educational Association (\"Arbetarnas bildningsförbund\", ABF) and the Moa Martinson Society. The Moa Award (\"Moa-priset\") is an annual prize awarded to a person who writes in the spirit of Martinson.\n\n\nWorks by Martinson:\n\n\n\n"}

A replacement can also involve multiple consecutive symbols, as viewed in one encoding, when the same binary code constitutes one symbol in the other encoding. This is either because of differing constant length encoding (as in Asian 16-bit encodings vs European 8-bit encodings), or the use of variable length encodings (notably UTF-8 and UTF-16).\n\nFailed rendering of glyphs due to either missing fonts or missing glyphs in a font is a different issue that is not to be confused with mojibake. Symptoms of this failed rendering include blocks with the code point displayed in hexadecimal or using the generic replacement character �. Importantly, these replacements are \"valid\" and are the result of correct error handling by the software.\n\n\"Mojibake\" means \"character transformation\" in Japanese. The word is composed of (moji, ), \"character\" and (bake, , pronounced \"bah-keh\"), \"transform\".\n\nTo correctly reproduce the original text that was encoded, the correspondence between the encoded data and the notion of its encoding must be preserved. As mojibake is the instance of non-compliance between these, it can be achieved by manipulating the data itself, or just relabeling it.\n\nMojibake is often seen with text data that have been tagged with a wrong encoding; it may not even be tagged at all, but moved between computers with different default encodings. A major source of trouble are communication protocols that rely on settings on each computer rather than sending or storing metadata together with the data.\n\nThe differing default settings between computers are in part due to differing deployments of Unicode among operating system families, and partly the legacy encodings' specializations for different writing systems of human languages. Whereas Linux distributions mostly switched to UTF-8 in 2004, Microsoft Windows still uses codepages for text files that differ between languages.\n\nFor some writing systems, an example being Japanese, several encodings have historically been employed, causing users to see mojibake relatively often. As a Japanese example, the word \"mojibake\" \"文字化け\" stored as EUC-JP might be incorrectly displayed as \"ﾊｸｻ�ｽ､ｱ\", \"ﾊｸｻ嵂ｽ､ｱ\" (MS-932), or \"ﾊｸｻ郾ｽ､ｱ\" (Shift JIS-2004). The same text stored as UTF-8 is displayed as \"譁�蟄怜喧縺�\" if interpreted as Shift JIS. This is further exacerbated if other locales are involved: the same UTF-8 text appears as \"æ–‡å—åŒ–ã‘\" in software that assumes text to be in the Windows-1252 or ISO-8859-1 encodings, usually labelled Western, or (for example) as \"鏂囧瓧鍖栥亼\" if interpreted as being in a GBK (Mainland China) locale.\n\nIf the encoding is not specified, it is up to the software to decide it by other means. Depending on the type of software, the typical solution is either configuration or charset detection heuristics. Both are prone to mis-prediction in not-so-uncommon scenarios.\n\nThe encoding of text files is usually governed by the OS-level setting, which depends on brand of operating system and possibly the user's language. Therefore, the assumed encoding is systematically wrong for files that come from a computer with a different setting, for example when transferring files between Windows and Linux. One solution is to use a byte order mark, but for source code and other machine readable text, many parsers don't tolerate this. Another is storing the encoding as metadata in the file system. File systems that support extended file attributes can store this as codice_1. This also requires support in software that wants to take advantage of it, but does not disturb other software.\n\nWhile a few encodings are easy to detect, in particular UTF-8, there are many that are hard to distinguish (see charset detection). A web browser may not be able to distinguish a page coded in EUC-JP and another in Shift-JIS if the coding scheme is not assigned explicitly using HTTP headers sent along with the documents, or using the HTML document's meta tags that are used to substitute for missing HTTP headers if the server cannot be configured to send the proper HTTP headers; see character encodings in HTML.\n\nMojibake also occurs when the encoding is wrongly specified. This often happens between encodings that are similar. For example, the Eudora email client for Windows was known to send emails labelled as ISO-8859-1 that were in reality Windows-1252. The Mac OS version of Eudora did not exhibit this behaviour. Windows-1252 contains extra printable characters in the C1 range (the most frequently seen being the typographically correct quotation marks and dashes), that were not displayed properly in software complying with the ISO standard; this especially affected software running under other operating systems such as Unix.\n\nOf the encodings still in use, many are partially compatible with each other, with ASCII as the predominant common subset. This sets the stage for human ignorance:\n\nWhen there are layers of protocols, each trying to specify the encoding based on different information, the least certain information may be misleading to the recipient.\nFor example, consider a web server serving a static HTML file over HTTP. The character set may be communicated to the client in any number of 3 ways:\n\nMuch older hardware is typically designed to support only one character set and the character set typically cannot be altered. The character table contained within the display firmware will be localized to have characters for the country the device is to be sold in, and typically the table differs from country to country. As such, these systems will potentially display mojibake when loading text generated on a system from a different country. Likewise, many early operating systems do not support multiple encoding formats and thus will end up displaying mojibake if made to display non-standard text- early versions of Microsoft Windows and Palm OS for example, are localized on a per-country basis and will only support encoding standards relevant to the country the localized version will be sold in, and will display mojibake if a file containing a text in a different encoding format from the version that the OS is designed to support is opened.\n\nApplications using UTF-8 as a default encoding may achieve a greater degree of interoperability because of its widespread use and backward compatibility with US-ASCII. UTF-8 also has the ability to be directly recognised by a simple algorithm, so that well written software should be able to avoid mixing UTF-8 up with other encodings.\n\nThe difficulty of resolving an instance of mojibake varies depending on the application within which it occurs and the causes of it. Two of the most common applications in which mojibake may occur are web browsers and word processors. Modern browsers and word processors often support a wide array of character encodings. Browsers often allow a user to change their rendering engine's encoding setting on the fly, while word processors allow the user to select the appropriate encoding when opening a file. It may take some trial and error for users to find the correct encoding.\n\nThe problem gets more complicated when it occurs in an application that normally does not support a wide range of character encoding, such as in a non-Unicode computer game. In this case, the user must change the operating system's encoding settings to match that of the game. However, changing the system-wide encoding settings can also cause Mojibake in pre-existing applications. In Windows XP or later, a user also has the option to use Microsoft AppLocale, an application that allows the changing of per-application locale settings. Even so, changing the operating system encoding settings is not possible on earlier operating systems such as Windows 98; to resolve this issue on earlier operating systems, a user would have to use third party font rendering applications.\n\nMojibake in English texts generally occurs in punctuation, such as em dashes (—), en dashes (–), and curly quotes (“,”,‘,’), but rarely in character text, since most encodings agree with ASCII on the encoding of the English alphabet. For example, the pound sign \"£\" will appear as \"Â£\" if it was encoded by the sender as UTF-8 but interpreted by the recipient as CP1252 or ISO 8859-1. If iterated, this can lead to \"Ã‚Â£\", \"Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£\", \"ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£\", etc.\n\nSome computers did, in older eras, have vendor-specific encodings which caused mismatch also for English text.\nCommodore brand 8-bit computers used PETSCII encoding, particularly notable for \"inverting\" the upper and lower case compared to standard ASCII. PETSCII printers worked fine on other computers of the era, but flipped the case of all letters. IBM mainframes use the EBCDIC encoding which does not match ASCII at all.\n\nUsers of Central and Eastern European languages can also be affected. Because most computers were not connected to any network during the mid- to late-1980s, there were different character encodings for every language with diacritical characters (see ISO/IEC 8859 and KOI-8), often also varying by operating system.\n\nMojibake may be colloquially called \"krakozyabry\" (кракозя́бры, IPA:) in Russian, which was and remains complicated by several systems for encoding Cyrillic. The Soviet Union and early Russian Federation developed KOI encodings (Kod Obmena Informatsiey, Код Обмена Информацией, which translates to \"Code for Information Exchange\"). This began with Cyrillic-only 7-bit KOI7, based on ASCII but with Latin and some other characters replaced with Cyrillic letters. Then came 8-bit KOI8 encoding that is an ASCII extension which encodes Cyrillic letters only with high-bit set octets corresponding to 7-bit codes from KOI7. It is for this reason that KOI8 text, even Russian, remains partially readable after stripping the eighth bit, which was considered as a major advantage in the age of 8BITMIME-unaware email systems. For example, words \"Школа русского языка\" \"shkola russkogo yazyka\", encoded in KOI8 and then passed through the high bit stripping process, end up rendered as \"[KOLA RUSSKOGO qZYKA\". Eventually KOI8 gained different flavors for Russian/Bulgarian (KOI8-R), Ukrainian (KOI8-U), Belarusian (KOI8-RU) and even Tajik (KOI8-T).\n\nMeanwhile, in the West, Code page 866 supported Ukrainian and Belarusian as well as Russian/Bulgarian in MS-DOS. For Microsoft Windows, Code Page 1251 added support for Serbian and other Slavic variants of Cyrillic.\n\nMost recently, the Unicode encoding includes code points for practically all the characters of all the world's languages, including all Cyrillic characters.\n\nBefore Unicode, it was necessary to match text encoding with a font using the same encoding system. Failure to do this produced unreadable gibberish whose specific appearance varied depending on the exact combination of text encoding and font encoding. For example, attempting to view non-Unicode Cyrillic text using a font that is limited to the Latin alphabet, or using the default (\"Western\") encoding, typically results in text that consists almost entirely of vowels with diacritical marks. (KOI8 \"Библиотека\" (\"biblioteka\", library) becomes \"âÉÂÌÉÏÔÅËÁ\".) Using Windows codepage 1251 to view text in KOI8 or vice versa results in garbled text that consists mostly of capital letters (KOI8 and codepage 1251 share the same ASCII region, but KOI8 has uppercase letters in the region where codepage 1251 has lowercase, and vice versa). In general, Cyrillic gibberish is symptomatic of using the wrong Cyrillic font. During the early years of the Russian sector of the World Wide Web, both KOI8 and codepage 1251 were common. As of 2017, one can still encounter HTML pages in codepage 1251 and, rarely, KOI8 encodings, as well as Unicode. (An estimated 1.7% of all web pages worldwide – all languages included – are encoded in codepage 1251.) Though the HTML standard includes the ability to specify the encoding for any given web page in its source, this is sometimes neglected, forcing the user to switch encodings in the browser manually.\n\nIn Bulgarian, mojibake is often called \"majmunica\" (маймуница), meaning \"monkey's [alphabet]\". In Serbian, it is called \"đubre\" (ђубре), meaning \"trash\". Unlike the former USSR, South Slavs never used something like KOI8, and Code Page 1251 was the dominant Cyrillic encoding there before Unicode. Therefore, these languages experienced fewer encoding incompatibility troubles than Russian. In the 1980s, Bulgarian computers used their own MIK encoding, which is superficially similar to (although incompatible with) CP866.\n\nPrior to the creation of ISO 8859-2 in 1987, users of various computing platforms used their own character encodings such as AmigaPL on Amiga, Atari Club on Atari ST and Masovia, IBM CP852, Mazovia and Windows CP1250 on IBM PCs. Polish companies selling early DOS computers created their own mutually-incompatible ways to encode Polish characters and simply reprogrammed the EPROMs of the video cards (typically CGA, EGA, or Hercules) to provide hardware code pages with the needed glyphs for Polish—arbitrarily located without reference to where other computer sellers had placed them.\n\nThe situation began to improve when, after pressure from academic and user groups, ISO 8859-2 succeeded as the \"Internet standard\" with limited support of the dominant vendors' software (today largely replaced by Unicode). With the numerous problems caused by the variety of encodings, even today some users tend to refer to Polish diacritical characters as \"krzaczki\" ([kshach-kih], lit. \"little shrubs\").\n\nSlovenian, Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, the variants of the Yugoslav Serbo-Croatian language, add to the basic Latin alphabet the letters š, đ, č, ć, ž, and their capital counterparts Š, Đ, Č, Ć, Ž (only č/Č, š/Š and ž/Ž in Slovenian; officially, although others are used when needed, mostly in foreign names, as well). All of these letters are defined in Latin-2 and Windows-1250, while only some (š, Š, ž, Ž, Đ) exist in the usual OS-default Windows-1252, and are there because of some other languages.\n\nAlthough Mojibake can occur with any of these characters, the letters that are not included in Windows-1252 are much more prone to errors. Thus, even nowadays, \"šđčćž ŠĐČĆŽ\" is often displayed as \"šðèæž ŠÐÈÆŽ\", although ð, è, æ, È, Æ are never used in Slavic languages.\n\nWhen confined to basic ASCII (most user names, for example), common replacements are: š→s, đ→dj, č→c, ć→cj, ž→z (capital forms analogously, with Đ→Dj or Đ→DJ depending on word case). All of these replacements introduce ambiguities, so reconstructing the original from such a form is usually done manually if required.\n\nThe Windows-1252 encoding is important because the English versions of the Windows operating system are most widespread, not localized ones. The reasons for this include a relatively small and fragmented market, increasing the price of high quality localization, a high degree of software piracy (in turn caused by high price of software compared to income), which discourages localization efforts, and people preferring English versions of Windows and other software .\n\nThe drive to differentiate Croatian from Serbian, Bosnian from Croatian and Serbian, and now even Montenegrin from the other three creates many problems. There are many different localizations, using different standards and of different quality. There are no common translations for the vast amount of computer terminology originating in English. In the end, people use adopted English words (\"kompjuter\" for \"computer\", \"kompajlirati\" for \"compile,\" etc.), and if they are unaccustomed to the translated terms may not understand what some option in a menu is supposed to do based on the translated phrase. Therefore, people who understand English, as well as those who are accustomed to English terminology (who are most, because English terminology is also mostly taught in schools because of these problems) regularly choose the original English versions of non-specialist software.\n\nWhen Cyrillic script is used (for Macedonian and partially Serbian), the problem is similar to other Cyrillic-based scripts.\n\nNewer versions of English Windows allow the ANSI codepage to be changed (older versions require special English versions with this support), but this setting can be and often was incorrectly set. For example, Windows 98/Me can be set to most non-right-to-left single-byte codepages including 1250, but only at install time.\n\nHungarian is another affected language, which uses the 26 basic English characters, plus the accented forms á, é, í, ó, ú, ö, ü (all present in the Latin-1 character set), plus the two characters ő and ű, which are not in Latin-1. These two characters can be correctly encoded in Latin-2, Windows-1250 and Unicode. Before Unicode became common in e-mail clients, e-mails containing Hungarian text often had the letters ő and ű corrupted, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It is common to respond to an e-mail rendered unreadable (see examples below) by character mangling (referred to as \"betűszemét\", meaning \"garbage lettering\") with the phrase \"Árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép\", a nonsense phrase (literally \"Flood-resistant mirror-drilling machine\") containing all accented characters used in Hungarian.\n\nThe alphabets of the North Germanic languages, Catalan, Finnish, German, French, Portuguese and Spanish are all extensions of the Latin alphabet. The additional characters are typically the ones that become corrupted, making texts only mildly unreadable with mojibake:\n... and their uppercase counterparts, if applicable.\n\nThese are languages for which the iso-8859-1 character set (also known as \"Latin 1\" or \"Western\") has been in use. However, iso-8859-1 has been obsoleted by two competing standards, the backward compatible windows-1252, and the slightly altered iso-8859-15. Both add the Euro sign € and the French œ, but otherwise any confusion of these three character sets does not create mojibake in these languages. Furthermore, it is always safe to interpret iso-8859-1 as windows-1252, and fairly safe to interpret it as iso-8859-15, in particular with respect to the Euro sign, which replaces the rarely used currency sign (¤). However, with the advent of UTF-8, mojibake has become more common in certain scenarios, e.g. exchange of text files between UNIX and Windows computers, due to UTF-8's incompatibility with Latin-1 and Windows-1252. But UTF-8 has the ability to be directly recognised by a simple algorithm, so that well written software should be able to avoid mixing UTF-8 up with other encodings, so this was most common when many had software not supporting UTF-8. Most of these languages were supported by MS-DOS default CP437 and other machine default encodings, except ASCII, so problems when buying an operating system version were less common. Windows and MS-DOS are not compatible however.\n\nIn Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and German, vowels are rarely repeated, and it is usually obvious when one character gets corrupted, e.g. the second letter in \"kÃ⁠¤rlek\" (', \"love\"). This way, even though the reader has to guess between å, ä and ö, almost all texts remain legible. Finnish text, on the other hand, does feature repeating vowels in words like ' (\"wedding night\") which can sometimes render text very hard to read (e.g. ' appears as \"hÃ⁠¤Ã⁠¤yÃ⁠¶\"). Icelandic and Faroese have ten and eight possibly confounding characters, respectively, which thus can make it more difficult to guess corrupted characters; Icelandic words like ' (\"outstanding hospitality\") become almost entirely unintelligible when rendered as \"Ã¾jÃ³Ã°lÃ¶Ã°\".\n\nIn German, ' (\"letter salad\") is a common term for this phenomenon, and in Spanish, ' (literally deformation).\n\nSome users transliterate their writing when using a computer, either by omitting the problematic diacritics, or by using digraph replacements (å → aa, ä/æ → ae, ö/ø → oe, ü → ue etc.). Thus, an author might write \"ueber\" instead of \"über\", which is standard practice in German when umlauts are not available. The latter practice seems to be better tolerated in the German language sphere than in the Nordic countries. For example, in Norwegian, digraphs are associated with archaic Danish, and may be used jokingly. However, digraphs are useful in communication with other parts of the world. As an example, the Norwegian football player Ole Gunnar Solskjær had his name spelled \"SOLSKJAER\" on his back when he played for Manchester United.\n\nAn artifact of UTF-8 misinterpreted as ISO-8859-1, \"Ring meg nÃ¥\" (\"\"), was seen in an SMS scam raging in Norway in June 2014.\nThe writing systems of certain languages of the Caucasus region, including the scripts of Georgian and Armenian, may produce mojibake. This problem is particularly acute in the case of ArmSCII or ARMSCII, a set of obsolete character encodings for the Armenian alphabet which have been superseded by Unicode standards. ArmSCII is not widely used because of a lack of support in the computer industry. For example, Microsoft Windows does not support it.\n\nAnother type of mojibake occurs when text is erroneously parsed in a multi-byte encoding, such as one of the encodings for East Asian languages. With this kind of mojibake more than one (typically two) characters are corrupted at once, e.g. \"k舐lek\" (\"kärlek\") in Swedish, where \"är\" is parsed as \"舐\". Compared to the above mojibake, this is harder to read, since letters unrelated to the problematic å, ä or ö are missing, and is especially problematic for short words starting with å, ä or ö such as \"än\" (which becomes \"舅\"). Since two letters are combined, the mojibake also seems more random (over 50 variants compared to the normal three, not counting the rarer capitals). In some rare cases, an entire text string which happens to include a pattern of particular word lengths, such as the sentence \"Bush hid the facts\", may be misinterpreted.\n\nIn Japanese, the phenomenon is, as mentioned, called . It is a particular problem in Japan due to the numerous different encodings that exist for Japanese text. Alongside Unicode encodings like UTF-8 and UTF-16, there are other standard encodings, such as Shift-JIS (Windows machines) and EUC-JP (UNIX systems). Mojibake, as well as being encountered by Japanese users, is also often encountered by non-Japanese when attempting to run software written for the Japanese market.\n\nIn Chinese, the same phenomenon is called \"Luàn mǎ\" (Pinyin, Simplified Chinese , Traditional Chinese , meaning chaotic code), and can occur when computerised text is encoded in one Chinese character encoding but is displayed using the wrong encoding. When this occurs, it is often possible to fix the issue by switching the character encoding without loss of data. The situation is complicated because of the existence of several Chinese character encoding systems in use, the most common ones being: Unicode, Big5, and Guobiao (with several backward compatible versions), and the possibility of Chinese characters being encoded using Japanese encoding.\n\nIt is easy to identify the original encoding when \"luanma\" occurs in Guobiao encodings: \nAn additional problem is caused when encodings are missing characters, which is common with rare or antiquated characters that are still used in personal or place names. Examples of this are Taiwanese politicians Wang Chien-shien ()'s \"煊\", Yu Shyi-kun ()'s \"堃\" and singer David Tao ()'s \"喆\" missing in Big5, ex-PRC Premier Zhu Rongji ()'s \"镕\" missing in GB2312, copyright symbol \"©\" missing in GBK.\n\nNewspapers have dealt with this problem in various ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters; using a picture of the personality; or simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference.\n\nA similar effect can occur in Brahmic or Indic scripts of South Asia, used in such Indo-Aryan or Indic languages as Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi, and others, even if the character set employed is properly recognized by the application. This is because, in many Indic scripts, the rules by which individual letter symbols combine to create symbols for syllables may not be properly understood by a computer missing the appropriate software, even if the glyphs for the individual letter forms are available.\n\nA particularly notable example of this is the old Wikipedia logo, which attempts to show the character analogous to \"wi\" (the first syllable of \"Wikipedia\") on each of many puzzle pieces. The puzzle piece meant to bear the Devanagari character for \"wi\" instead used to display the \"wa\" character followed by an unpaired \"i\" modifier vowel, easily recognizable as mojibake generated by a computer not configured to display Indic text. The logo as redesigned has fixed these errors.\n\nThe idea of Plain Text requires the operating system to provide a font to display Unicode codes. This font is different from OS to OS for Singhala and it makes orthographically incorrect glyphs for some letters (syllables) across all operating systems. For instance, the 'reph', the short form for 'r' is a diacritic that normally goes on top of a plain letter. However, it is wrong to go on top of some letters like 'ya' or 'la' but it happens in all operating systems. This appears to be a fault of internal programming of the fonts. In Macintosh / iPhone, the muurdhaja l (dark l) and 'u' combination and its long form both yield wrong shapes.\n\nSome Indic and Indic-derived scripts, most notably Lao, were not officially supported by Windows XP until the release of Vista. However, various sites have made free-to-download fonts.\n\nIn certain writing systems of Africa, unencoded text is unreadable. Texts that may produce mojibake include those from the Horn of Africa such as the Ge'ez script in Ethiopia and Eritrea, used for Amharic, Tigre, and other languages, and the Somali language, which employs the Osmanya alphabet. In Southern Africa, the Mwangwego alphabet is used to write languages of Malawi and the Mandombe alphabet was created for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but these are not generally supported. Various other writing systems native to West Africa present similar problems, such as the N'Ko alphabet, used for Manding languages in Guinea, and the Vai syllabary, used in Liberia.\n\nAnother affected language is Arabic (see below). The text becomes unreadable when the encodings do not match.\n\nThe examples in this article do not have UTF-8 as browser setting, because UTF-8 is easily recognisable, so if a browser supports UTF-8 it should recognise it automatically, and not try to interpret something else as UTF-8.\n\n\n\n"}

Her tales, described as “reminiscent in their fantastic blend of realism, myth, and superstition of writers like Rulfo, Garcia Marquez, even Tutuola,” frequently take as their setting the small, remote village in southern Iran where she was born. Nahid Mozaffari, editor of Strange Times, My Dear: The International PEN Anthology of Contemporary Iranian Literature, writes that Ravanipour “has been successful in the treatment of the complex subjects of tradition and modernity, juxtaposing elements of both, and exposing them in all their contradictions without idealizing either.” Ms. Ravanipour was among seventeen activists to face trial in Iran for their participation in the 2000 Berlin Conference, accused of taking part in anti-Iran propaganda. Copies of her current work were recently stripped from bookstore shelves in Iran in a countrywide police action. She is a former Brown University International Writers Project Fellow.\n\nMoniro Ravanipour was born on 1952, in Bushehr, South of Iran. Lived in Bushehr till she was 17, and moved to Shiraz for Pahlavi Private High school. \nJoined Shiraz Pahlavi University in 1972 and studied Chemistry, and then changed major and took a degree in Psychology.\nShe started theatre in Bushehr and joined the Theater and Literary Society of Bushehr.\n\nMoniro joined a theatre group in Bushehr called The Theatre and Literary Society of Bushehr. In 1967 Moniro acted in Mother, A play by Manouchehr Atashi. She then continued to act and participated in the production of several plays in Shiraz. Moniro worked with a group of college students for a play called Abazar Ghafari which was banned later. In 1975 she joined Shiraz Theatre Group for producing a play named Moalem, by Shapour Jowrkesh, and in 1976 participated in Tous Theatre Festival, and worked with Shapour Jowrkesh again, for a play named Khoubchehr.\n\nIn early post revolution years she was involved in political activities and was banned from studying. During these years, her brother was executed, all her sister were banned from education in elementary and high school, one of her sisters and her husband were sentenced to death penalty and escaped Iran, one of her brothers-in-law got arrested several times. For a decade, she couldn't have a stable place of residence due to the mentioned situation, and she moved from one place to another. She wrote her first short story collection in 1977 named \"The Sparrow and Mr. President\" which was immediately banned from publishing and collected from shelves. After their house was attacked and pillaged in Bushehr, her family moved to Shiraz, and then Moniro moved to Tehran and using a fake name, worked as a worker in Daroupakhsh Factory. After her true identity was revealed using another fake name she worked for another six months in Amidi Factory. Later she worked the grave yard shift nurse in a private hospital, again using a fake name. In 1983 Moniro went back to Shiraz to visit her parents, and she got arrested on the street, when the regime was doing the random arrest of the citizens. It was during the terrible prison days that she decided to become a writer of big fame and success when she is free again, so she would not get killed and forgotten like many others were.\n\nMoniro started writing again from 1965, and wrote children's books and screen plays. \nA year after Iran-Iraq War she went to the City Khanaqin boundaries, for writing a novel about war using the identity of a Martyr's mother. \nAfter 1988 Moniro published her works using her real name and in 1994 for the first time she was invited the Women's studies Organization of Vienna. Later she was invited for speeches to 21 countries, and then she was invited by: Khaneh Farhanghaye Jahan, Goethe-Institut, Literary Center of Gumusluk, Bodrum, Gothenburg expo in Sweden, Heinrich Böll Foundation, in Germany, France, U.S., and ...\n\nShe is famous for using magic realism, but the truth is that she uses the bitter reality she found in the happenings and real life in her homeland. Despite the bold use of surrealism and magical realism, she uses realism too.

From 1979–85, there was a nativist agitation in Assam against the influx of alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, and several camps were attacked by the activists. Borgohain's investigation into these attacks resulted in essays that led to her controversial sacking from the magazine.\n\nBorgohain began publishing short stories under the pseudonym Neelima Devi in the journal \"Ramdhenu\". Some of her works are \"Anek Akas\" (\"Many Skies\", 1961), \"Jalachabi\" (\"Movie\", 1966), \"Sunyatar Kavya\" (\"Poems of Emptiness\", 1969).\n\nBorgohain's first novel \"Sei Nadi Niravadhi\" (\"The River Keeps Flowing\") was published in 1963. This intertwined the story of a woman with the fate of a river, while \"Ejan Budha Manuh\" (\"An Old Man\", 1966) centred on the relationship between a father and son, laying bare the tensions fraying it owing to an inter-caste marriage.\n\nHer feminist novels \"Dinor Pisot Dinor\" (1968), \"Anya Jivan\" (1986) and \"Champavati\" were noted for their sympathetic portrayals of women facing up to oppressive social mores and the patriarchy. Meanwhile, the degradation faced by the indigent, owing to rural migration as well as the breakdown of the old established social orders, was acutely described in her \"Dinor Pisot Dinor\" as well as \"Bhabhishat Rongat Surya\" (1980). \"Iparor Ghor Siparor Ghor\" (\"Houses of This Side and That\", 1979) again depicted the migration of rural folks to urban areas in search of a better life; the tale was told in a naturalistic form, realistic but suffused with pessimism.\n\nBorgohain's \"Abhiyatri\" (1995) was a biographical novel of the life of an Assamese freedom fighter, feminist and social activist, Chandraprava Saikiani. This won her the Sahitya Akademi literary award the following year, and is considered one of her finest novels.\n\n\n\nBorgohain has received numerous accolades for her literary achievements.\n\n"}

His works were written in Romansch and German, and comprised epic novels, short stories, and drama. He was also well known for his Ladin-German dictionary.\n\nOscar Peer was born on 23 April 1928 in Lavin, in the Lower Engadine, Switzerland. His father, Jon Peer, was a one-time lumberjack, while his mother Silva Wieser belonged to a farming family. He was the fourth of five children.\n\nPeer began his training as a machinist before abandoning his apprenticeship to join a teachers' training school in Chur. He taught in Tschierv and Felsberg as a primary school teacher. He then proceeded to study German and Romance language at the University of Zurich and Sorbonne. He obtained his PhD with a dissertation on Gian Fontana, a writer in Surselva. He worked as a middle-school teacher in Winterthur, and finally as a lecturer at the Chur teachers' training college.\n\nPeer met his wife, Monica, at the training college - he was a substitute teacher and she, a student. They had two children, Simon and Leta.\n\nPeer died from a long illness on 22 December 2013 in Chur.\n\nOscar Peer was encouraged to take up writing by his older brother Andri Peer, who was also a novelist. His first published piece of narrative, \"A Wedding in Winter\", came out in 1972. His Vallader story \"Accord\" was published in 1978; it was made into a film in 1985. He wrote often in the Vallader dialect, and in German. His later books came out in both languages, but were not mere translations of each other. Instead, both language versions contained their own nuances and often deviated from each other; they could be considered significant works in their own right.\n\nPeer rewrote his works several times and republished them in new editions. He would be satisfied with a book only when he \"could re-read it with a good conscience\". One of his earliest works was the short story \"Chasa Veglia\", published in his brother's collection \"Chalender Ladin\". He continued to rework this piece until the most recent version was published in 2010, both in German and Romansch.\n\nThe world of rural Lower Engadine, where Peer was born, influenced both him and his work. His motifs were of a person excluded in a small country, of loners and rule-breakers. But he was not overtly a political writer, and in most of his prose works, history and politics are subsumed under the narrative. An exception is his memoir \"Das Raunen des Flusses\" in which the reader is introduced to the characters and places of Peer's formative years, and the events of the 1930s and 1940s in the Lower Engardine are reported.\n\nPeer's philological career culminated in the compilation of the \"Rumantsch Dicziunari, ladin-tudais-ch\", a multilingual dictionary. With this, he was able to establish a solid base for the Romansch language. Peer was a strong advocate of the importance of local idiom over standardised language.\n\nWith the decline in the number of speakers of the Romansch dialects in Switzerland, the readership of works in the language has also reduced. Peer's efforts to sustain the tradition complement those of his peers - Ruth Plouda, GIon Deplazes, Clo Dori Bezzola, Andri Peer and Cla Biert.\n\n\n\n\nPeer won the Swiss Schiller prize in 1996 for his entire oeuvre.\n\nIn 2014, Peer will posthumously receive the Bündner Literature prize.\n"}
{"id": "22641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22641", "title": "Oxford English Dictionary", "text": "Oxford English Dictionary\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is the principal historical dictionary of the English language, published by Oxford University Press. It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world. The second edition, comprising 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, was published in 1989.\n\nWork began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was only in 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project, under the name of \"A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society\". In 1895, the title \"The Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, the title \"The Oxford English Dictionary\" fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published. Since 2000, compilation of a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately half of which is complete.\n\nThe first electronic version of the dictionary was made available in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will most likely only appear in electronic form: the Chief Executive of Oxford University Press has stated that it is unlikely that it will ever be printed.\n\nAs a historical dictionary, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" explains words by showing their development rather than merely their present-day usages. Therefore, it shows definitions in the order that the sense of the word began being used, including word meanings which are no longer used. Each definition is shown with numerous short usage quotations; in each case, the first quotation shows the first recorded instance of the word that the editors are aware of and, in the case of words and senses no longer in current usage, the last quotation is the last known recorded usage. This allows the reader to get an approximate sense of the time period in which a particular word has been in use, and additional quotations help the reader to ascertain information about how the word is used in context, beyond any explanation that the dictionary editors can provide.\n\nThe format of the \"OED\"'s entries has influenced numerous other historical lexicography projects. The forerunners to the \"OED\", such as the early volumes of the \"Deutsches Wörterbuch\", had initially provided few quotations from a limited number of sources, whereas the \"OED\" editors preferred larger groups of quite short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications. This influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works.\n\nAccording to the publishers, it would take a single person 120 years to \"key in\" the 59 million words of the \"OED\" second edition, 60 years to proofread them, and 540 megabytes to store them electronically. As of 30 November 2005, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" contained approximately 301,100 main entries. Supplementing the entry headwords, there are 157,000 bold-type combinations and derivatives; 169,000 italicized-bold phrases and combinations; 616,500 word-forms in total, including 137,000 pronunciations; 249,300 etymologies; 577,000 cross-references; and 2,412,400 usage quotations. The dictionary's latest, complete print edition (second edition, 1989) was printed in 20 volumes, comprising 291,500 entries in 21,730 pages. The longest entry in the \"OED2\" was for the verb \"set\", which required 60,000 words to describe some 430 senses. As entries began to be revised for the \"OED3\" in sequence starting from M, the longest entry became \"make\" in 2000, then \"put\" in 2007, then \"run\" in 2011.\n\nDespite its considerable size, the \"OED\" is neither the world's largest nor the earliest exhaustive dictionary of a language. Another earlier large dictionary is the Grimm brothers' dictionary of the German language, begun in 1838 and completed in 1961. The first edition of the \"Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca\" is the first great dictionary devoted to a modern European language (Italian) and was published in 1612; the first edition of \"Dictionnaire de l'Académie française\" dates from 1694. The official dictionary of Spanish is the \"Diccionario de la lengua española\" (produced, edited, and published by the Real Academia Española), and its first edition was published in 1780. The Kangxi dictionary of Chinese was published in 1716.\n\nThe dictionary began as a Philological Society project of a small group of intellectuals in London (and unconnected to Oxford University): Richard Chenevix Trench, Herbert Coleridge, and Frederick Furnivall, who were dissatisfied with the existing English dictionaries. The Society expressed interest in compiling a new dictionary as early as 1844, but it was not until June 1857 that they began by forming an \"Unregistered Words Committee\" to search for words that were unlisted or poorly defined in current dictionaries. In November, Trench's report was not a list of unregistered words; instead, it was the study \"On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries\", which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries:\n\nThe Society ultimately realized that the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the English dictionaries of the 19th century, and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in English dictionaries to a larger project. Trench suggested that a new, truly \"comprehensive\" dictionary was needed. On 7 January 1858, the Society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary. Volunteer readers would be assigned particular books, copying passages illustrating word usage onto quotation slips. Later the same year, the Society agreed to the project in principle, with the title \"A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles\" (\"NED\").\n\nRichard Chenevix Trench (1807–1886) played the key role in the project's first months, but his Church of England appointment as Dean of Westminster meant that he could not give the dictionary project the time that it required. He withdrew and Herbert Coleridge became the first editor.\n\nOn 12 May 1860, Coleridge's dictionary plan was published and research was started. His house was the first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon-hole grid. In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of tuberculosis, aged 30.\n\nFurnivall then became editor; he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but temperamentally ill-suited for the work. Many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project, as Furnivall failed to keep them motivated. Furthermore, many of the slips were misplaced.\n\nFurnivall believed that, since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the Early English Text Society in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts. Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.\n\nIn the 1870s, Furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both Henry Sweet and Henry Nicol to succeed him. He then approached James Murray, who accepted the post of editor. In the late 1870s, Furnivall and Murray met with several publishers about publishing the dictionary. In 1878, Oxford University Press agreed with Murray to proceed with the massive project; the agreement was formalized the following year. The dictionary project finally had a publisher 20 years after the idea was conceived. It was another 50 years before the entire dictionary was complete.\n\nLate in his editorship, Murray learned that a prolific reader named W. C. Minor was a criminal lunatic. Minor was a Yale University-trained surgeon and military officer in the American Civil War, and was confined to Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane after killing a man in London. Minor invented his own quotation-tracking system, allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors' requests. The story of Murray and Minor later served as the central focus of \"The Surgeon of Crowthorne\" (US title: \"The Professor and the Madman\"), a popular book about the creation of the \"OED\".\n\nDuring the 1870s, the Philological Society was concerned with the process of publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope. They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the Cambridge University Press and the Oxford University Press were approached. The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the Philological Society president. The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four volumes, totalling 6,400 pages. They hoped to finish the project in ten years.\n\nMurray started the project, working in a corrugated iron outbuilding called the \"Scriptorium\" which was lined with wooden planks, book shelves, and 1,029 pigeon-holes for the quotation slips. He tracked and regathered Furnivall's collection of quotation slips, which were found to concentrate on rare, interesting words rather than common usages. For instance, there were ten times as many quotations for \"abusion\" as for \"abuse\". He appealed, through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries, for readers who would report \"as many quotations as you can for ordinary words\" and for words that were \"rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar or used in a peculiar way\". Murray had American philologist and liberal arts college professor Francis March manage the collection in North America; 1,000 quotation slips arrived daily to the Scriptorium and, by 1880, there were 2,500,000.\n\nThe first dictionary fascicle was published on 1 February 1884—twenty-three years after Coleridge's sample pages. The full title was \"A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society\"; the 352-page volume, words from \"A\" to \"Ant\", cost 12s 6d. (or about $668.24 in 2013) The total sales were only 4,000 copies.\n\nThe OUP saw that it would take too long to complete the work with unrevised editorial arrangements. Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray. The first was that he move from Mill Hill to Oxford, which he did in 1885. Murray had his Scriptorium re-erected on his new property.\nMurray resisted the second demand: that if he could not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor to work in parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned out not to be so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.\n\nGell continued harassing Murray and Bradley with his business concerns—containing costs and speeding production—to the point where the project's collapse seemed likely. Newspapers reported the harassment, particularly the \"Saturday Review\", and public opinion backed the editors. Gell was fired, and the university reversed his cost policies. If the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger, it would; it was an important work, and worth the time and money to properly finish.\n\nNeither Murray nor Bradley lived to see it. Murray died in 1915, having been responsible for words starting with \"A–D\", \"H–K\", \"O–P\", and \"T\", nearly half the finished dictionary; Bradley died in 1923, having completed \"E–G\", \"L–M\", \"S–Sh\", \"St\", and \"W–We\". By then, two additional editors had been promoted from assistant work to independent work, continuing without much trouble. William Craigie started in 1901 and was responsible for \"N\", \"Q–R\", \"Si–Sq\", \"U–V\", and \"Wo–Wy.\" The OUP had previously thought London too far from Oxford but, after 1925, Craigie worked on the dictionary in Chicago, where he was a professor. The fourth editor was Charles Talbut Onions, who compiled the remaining ranges starting in 1914: \"Su–Sz\", \"Wh–Wo\", and \"X–Z\".\n\nIn 1919–1920, J. R. R. Tolkien was employed by the \"OED\", researching etymologies of the \"Waggle\" to \"Warlock\" range; later he parodied the principal editors as \"The Four Wise Clerks of Oxenford\" in the story \"Farmer Giles of Ham\".\n\nBy early 1894, a total of 11 fascicles had been published, or about one per year: four for \"A–B\", five for \"C\", and two for \"E\". Of these, eight were 352 pages long, while the last one in each group was shorter to end at the letter break (which eventually became a volume break). At this point, it was decided to publish the work in smaller and more frequent instalments; once every three months beginning in 1895 there would be a fascicle of 64 pages, priced at 2s 6d. If enough material was ready, 128 or even 192 pages would be published together. This pace was maintained until World War I forced reductions in staff. Each time enough consecutive pages were available, the same material was also published in the original larger fascicles. Also in 1895, the title \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") was first used. It then appeared only on the outer covers of the fascicles; the original title was still the official one and was used everywhere else.\n\nThe 125th and last fascicle covered words from \"Wise\" to the end of \"W\" and was published on 19 April 1928, and the full dictionary in bound volumes followed immediately.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare is the most-quoted writer in the completed dictionary, with \"Hamlet\" his most-quoted work. George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) is the most-quoted female writer. Collectively, the Bible is the most-quoted work (but in many different translations); the most-quoted single work is \"Cursor Mundi\".\n\nBetween 1928 and 1933, enough additional material had been compiled to make a one-volume supplement, so the dictionary was reissued as the set of 12 volumes and a one-volume supplement in 1933.\n\nIn 1933, Oxford had finally put the dictionary to rest; all work ended, and the quotation slips went into storage. However, the English language continued to change and, by the time 20 years had passed, the dictionary was outdated.\n\nThere were three possible ways to update it. The cheapest would have been to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places. The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and retypeset, with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.\n\nRobert Burchfield was hired in 1957 to edit the second supplement; Onions turned 84 that year but was still able to make some contributions as well. The work on the supplement was expected to take about seven years. It actually took 29 years, by which time the new supplement \"(OEDS)\" had grown to four volumes, starting with \"A\", \"H\", \"O\", and \"Sea\". They were published in 1972, 1976, 1982, and 1986 respectively, bringing the complete dictionary to 16 volumes, or 17 counting the first supplement.\n\nBurchfield emphasized the inclusion of modern-day language and, through the supplement, the dictionary was expanded to include a wealth of new words from the burgeoning fields of science and technology, as well as popular culture and colloquial speech. Burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in English-speaking regions beyond the United Kingdom, including North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean. Burchfield also removed, for unknown reasons, many entries that had been added to the 1933 supplement. In 2012, an analysis by lexicographer Sarah Ogilvie revealed that many of these entries were in fact foreign loanwords, despite Burchfield's claim that he included more such words. The proportion was estimated from a sample calculation to amount to 17% of the foreign loan words and words from regional forms of English. Some of these had only a single recorded usage, but many had multiple recorded citations, and it ran against what was thought to be the established \"OED\" editorial practice and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to \"World English\".\n\nBy the time the new supplement was completed, it was clear that the full text of the dictionary would need to be computerized. Achieving this would require retyping it once, but thereafter it would always be accessible for computer searching – as well as for whatever new editions of the dictionary might be desired, starting with an integration of the supplementary volumes and the main text. Preparation for this process began in 1983, and editorial work started the following year under the administrative direction of Timothy J. Benbow, with John A. Simpson and Edmund S. C. Weiner as co-editors. In 2016, Simpson published his memoir chronicling his years at the OED. See \"The Word Detective: Searching for the Meaning of It All at the Oxford English Dictionary – A Memoir.\" Basic Books, New York.\nThus began the \"New Oxford English Dictionary (NOED)\" project. In the United States, more than 120 typists of the International Computaprint Corporation (now Reed Tech) started keying in over 350,000,000 characters, their work checked by 55 proof-readers in England. Retyping the text alone was not sufficient; all the information represented by the complex typography of the original dictionary had to be retained, which was done by marking up the content in SGML. A specialized search engine and display software were also needed to access it. Under a 1985 agreement, some of this software work was done at the University of Waterloo, Canada, at the \"Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary\", led by Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet; this search technology went on to become the basis for the Open Text Corporation. Computer hardware, database and other software, development managers, and programmers for the project were donated by the British subsidiary of IBM; the colour syntax-directed editor for the project, LEXX, was written by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM. The University of Waterloo, in Canada, volunteered to design the database. A. Walton Litz, an English professor at Princeton University who served on the Oxford University Press advisory council, was quoted in \"Time\" as saying \"I've never been associated with a project, I've never even heard of a project, that was so incredibly complicated and that met every deadline.\"\n\nBy 1989, the \"NOED\" project had achieved its primary goals, and the editors, working online, had successfully combined the original text, Burchfield's supplement, and a small amount of newer material, into a single unified dictionary. The word \"new\" was again dropped from the name, and the second edition of the \"OED,\" or the \"OED2,\" was published. The first edition retronymically became the \"OED1\".\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary 2\" was printed in 20 volumes. For the first time, there was no attempt to start them on letter boundaries, and they were made roughly equal in size. The 20 volumes started with \"A\", \"B.B.C.\", \"Cham\", \"Creel\", \"Dvandva\", \"Follow\", \"Hat\", \"Interval\", \"Look\", \"Moul\", \"Ow\", \"Poise\", \"Quemadero\", \"Rob\", \"Ser\", \"Soot\", \"Su\", \"Thru\", \"Unemancipated\", and \"Wave\".\n\nThe content of the \"OED2\" is mostly just a reorganization of the earlier corpus, but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long-needed format changes. The headword of each entry was no longer capitalized, allowing the user to readily see those words that actually require a capital letter. Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the \"OED2\" adopted the modern International Phonetic Alphabet. Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were transliterated.\n\nThe British quiz show \"Countdown\" has awarded the leather-bound complete version to the champions of each series since its inception in 1982.\n\nWhen the print version of the second edition was published in 1989, the response was enthusiastic. Author Anthony Burgess declared it \"the greatest publishing event of the century\", as quoted by the \"Los Angeles Times\". \"Time\" dubbed the book \"a scholarly Everest\", and Richard Boston, writing for \"The Guardian\", called it \"one of the wonders of the world\".\n\nThe supplements and their integration into the second edition were a great improvement to the \"OED\" as a whole, but it was recognized that most of the entries were still fundamentally unaltered from the first edition. Much of the information in the dictionary published in 1989 was already decades out of date, though the supplements had made good progress towards incorporating new vocabulary. Yet many definitions contained disproven scientific theories, outdated historical information, and moral values that were no longer widely accepted. Furthermore, the supplements had failed to recognize many words in the existing volumes as obsolete by the time of the second edition's publication, meaning that thousands of words were marked as current despite no recent evidence of their use.\n\nAccordingly, it was recognized that work on a third edition would have to begin to rectify these problems. The first attempt to produce a new edition came with the \"Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series,\" a new set of supplements to complement the \"OED2\" with the intention of producing a third edition from them. The previous supplements appeared in alphabetical installments, whereas the new series had a full A–Z range of entries within each individual volume, with a complete alphabetical index at the end of all words revised so far, each listed with the volume number which contained the revised entry.\n\nHowever, in the end only three \"Additions\" volumes were published this way, two in 1993 and one in 1997, each containing about 3,000 new definitions. The possibilities of the World Wide Web and new computer technology in general meant that the processes of researching the dictionary and of publishing new and revised entries could be vastly improved. New text search databases offered vastly more material for the editors of the dictionary to work with, and with publication on the Web as a possibility, the editors could publish revised entries much more quickly and easily than ever before. A new approach was called for, and for this reason it was decided to embark on a new, complete revision of the dictionary.\n\nBeginning with the launch of the first \"OED Online\" site in 2000, the editors of the dictionary began a major revision project to create a completely revised third edition of the dictionary (\"OED3\"), expected to be completed in 2037 at a projected cost of about £34 million.\n\nRevisions were started at the letter \"M\", with new material appearing every three months on the \"OED Online\" website. The editors chose to start the revision project from the middle of the dictionary in order that the overall quality of entries be made more even, since the later entries in the \"OED1\" generally tended to be better than the earlier ones. However, in March 2008, the editors announced that they would alternate each quarter between moving forward in the alphabet as before and updating \"key English words from across the alphabet, along with the other words which make up the alphabetical cluster surrounding them\". With the relaunch of the \"OED Online\" website in December 2010, alphabetical revision was abandoned altogether.\n\nThe revision is expected to roughly double the dictionary in size. Apart from general updates to include information on new words and other changes in the language, the third edition brings many other improvements, including changes in formatting and stylistic conventions to make entries clearer to read and enable more thorough searches to be made by computer, more thorough etymological information, and a general change of focus away from individual words towards more general coverage of the language as a whole. While the original text drew its quotations mainly from literary sources such as novels, plays, and poetry, with additional material from newspapers and academic journals, the new edition will reference more kinds of material that were unavailable to the editors of previous editions, such as wills, inventories, account books, diaries, journals, and letters.\n\nJohn Simpson was the first chief editor of the \"OED3\". He retired in 2013 and was replaced by Michael Proffitt, who is the eighth chief editor of the dictionary.\n\nThe production of the new edition takes full advantage of computer technology, particularly since the June 2005 inauguration of the whimsically named \"Perfect All-Singing All-Dancing Editorial and Notation Application\", or \"Pasadena\". With this XML-based system, the attention of lexicographers can be directed more to matters of content than to presentation issues such as the numbering of definitions. The new system has also simplified the use of the quotations database, and enabled staff in New York to work directly on the dictionary in the same way as their Oxford-based counterparts.\n\nOther important computer uses include internet searches for evidence of current usage, and email submissions of quotations by readers and the general public.\n\n\"Wordhunt\" was a 2005 appeal to the general public for help in providing citations for 50 selected recent words, and produced antedatings for many. The results were reported in a BBC TV series, \"Balderdash and Piffle\". The \"OED\"s small army of devoted readers continue to contribute quotations: the department currently receives about 200,000 a year.\n\n\"OED\" currently contains over 600,000 entries. They update the OED on a quarterly basis to make up for its Third Edition revising their existing entries and adding new words and senses.\n\nIn October 2018, more than 1,400 new words, senses, and sub-entries have been added to the OED including \"idiocracy\", \"nothingburger\" and \"bummock\". Words related to film terms were also joined. Additionally, Filipino words were listed in the dictionary like \"bongga\" and \"trapo\". \n\nIn 1971, the 13-volume \"OED1\" (1933) was reprinted as a two-volume \"Compact Edition\", by photographically reducing each page to one-half its linear dimensions; each compact edition page held four \"OED1\" pages in a four-up (\"4-up\") format. The two volume letters were \"A\" and \"P\"; the first supplement was at the second volume's end. The \"Compact Edition\" included, in a small slip-case drawer, a magnifying glass to help in reading reduced type. Many copies were inexpensively distributed through book clubs. In 1987, the second supplement was published as a third volume to the \"Compact Edition\".\n\nIn 1991, for the 20-volume \"OED2\" (1989), the compact edition format was re-sized to one-third of original linear dimensions, a nine-up (\"9-up\") format requiring greater magnification, but allowing publication of a single-volume dictionary. It was accompanied by a magnifying glass as before and \"A User's Guide to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\"\", by Donna Lee Berg. After these volumes were published, though, book club offers commonly continued to sell the two-volume 1971 \"Compact Edition\".\n\nOnce the text of the dictionary was digitized and online, it was also available to be published on CD-ROM. The text of the first edition was made available in 1987. Afterward, three versions of the second edition were issued. Version 1 (1992) was identical in content to the printed second edition, and the CD itself was not copy-protected. Version 2 (1999) included the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" \"Additions\" of 1993 and 1997.\n\nVersion 3.0 was released in 2002 with additional words from the \"OED3\" and software improvements. Version 3.1.1 (2007) added support for hard disk installation, so that the user does not have to insert the CD to use the dictionary. It has been reported that this version will work on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows, using emulation programs. Version 4.0 of the CD has been available since June 2009 and works with Windows 7 and Mac OS X (10.4 or later). This version uses the CD drive for installation, running only from the hard drive.\n\nOn 14 March 2000, the \"Oxford English Dictionary Online\" (\"OED Online\") became available to subscribers. The online database contains the entire \"OED2\" and is updated quarterly with revisions that will be included in the \"OED3\" (see above). The online edition is the most up-to-date version of the dictionary available. The \"OED\" web site is not optimized for mobile devices, but the developers have stated that there are plans to provide an API that would enable developers to develop different interfaces for querying the \"OED\".\n\nThe price for an individual to use this edition is £195 or US$295 every year, even after a reduction in 2004; consequently, most subscribers are large organizations such as universities. Some public libraries and companies have subscribed, as well, including public libraries in the United Kingdom, where access is funded by the Arts Council, and public libraries in New Zealand. Individuals who belong to a library which subscribes to the service are able to use the service from their own home without charge.\n\nThe \"OED\"'s utility and renown as a historical dictionary have led to numerous offspring projects and other dictionaries bearing the Oxford name, though not all are directly related to the \"OED\" itself.\n\nThe \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary,\" originally started in 1902 and completed in 1933, is an abridgement of the full work that retains the historical focus, but does not include any words which were obsolete before 1700 except those used by Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and the King James Bible. A completely new edition was produced from the \"OED2\" and published in 1993, with revisions in 2002 and 2007.\n\nThe \"Concise Oxford Dictionary\" is a different work, which aims to cover current English only, without the historical focus. The original edition, mostly based on the \"OED1\", was edited by Francis George Fowler and Henry Watson Fowler and published in 1911, before the main work was completed. Revised editions appeared throughout the twentieth century to keep it up to date with changes in English usage.\n\n\"The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English\" was originally conceived by F. G. Fowler and H. W. Fowler to be compressed, compact, and concise. Its primary source is the Oxford English Dictionary, and it is nominally an abridgment of the Concise Oxford Dictionary. It was first published in 1924.\n\nIn 1998 the \"New Oxford Dictionary of English\" (\"NODE\") was published. While also aiming to cover current English, \"NODE\" was not based on the \"OED\". Instead, it was an entirely new dictionary produced with the aid of corpus linguistics. Once \"NODE\" was published, a similarly brand-new edition of the \"Concise Oxford Dictionary\" followed, this time based on an abridgement of \"NODE\" rather than the \"OED\"; \"NODE\" (under the new title of the \"Oxford Dictionary of English\", or \"ODE\") continues to be principal source for Oxford's product line of current-English dictionaries, including the \"New Oxford American Dictionary\", with the \"OED\" now only serving as the basis for scholarly historical dictionaries.\n\nThe \"OED\" lists British headword spellings (e.g., \"labour\", \"centre\") with variants following (\"labor\", \"center\", etc.). For the suffix more commonly spelt \"-ise\" in British English, OUP policy dictates a preference for the spelling \"-ize\", e.g., \"realize\" vs. \"realise\" and \"globalization\" vs. \"globalisation\". The rationale is etymological, in that the English suffix is mainly derived from the Greek suffix \"-ιζειν\", (\"-izein\"), or the Latin \"-izāre\". However, \"-ze\" is also sometimes treated as an Americanism insofar as the \"-ze\" suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong, as with \"analyse\" (British English), which is spelt \"analyze\" in American English.\n\nBritish prime minister Stanley Baldwin described the \"OED\" as a \"national treasure\". Author Anu Garg, founder of Wordsmith.org, has called it a \"lex icon\". Tim Bray, co-creator of Extensible Markup Language (XML), credits the \"OED\" as the developing inspiration of that markup language.\n\nHowever, despite, and at the same time precisely because of, its claims of authority, the dictionary has been criticised since at least the 1960s from various angles. It has become a target precisely \"because\" of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes, its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence. The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement, University of Oxford linguist Roy Harris writes that criticizing the \"OED\" is extremely difficult because \"one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution\", one that \"has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle\". He further notes that neologisms from respected \"literary\" authors such as Samuel Beckett and Virginia Woolf are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less \"respectable\" sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the \"OED\"'s \"[b]lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage\", faulting the dictionary's prescriptive rather than descriptive usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as \"erroneous\" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the \"social bias[es]\" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of \"erroneous and catachrestic\" usages is being removed from third edition entries, sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.\n\nHarris also faults the editors' \"donnish conservatism\" and their adherence to prudish Victorian morals, citing as an example the non-inclusion of \"various centuries-old 'four-letter words'\" until 1972. However, no English dictionary included such words, for fear of possible prosecution under British obscenity laws, until after the conclusion of the \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" obscenity trial in 1960. The first dictionary to include the word \"fuck\" was the \"Penguin English Dictionary\" of 1965. Joseph Wright's \"English Dialect Dictionary\" had included \"shit\" in 1905.\n\nThe \"OED\"s claims of authority have also been questioned by linguists such as Pius ten Hacken, who notes that the dictionary actively strives towards definitiveness and authority but can only achieve those goals in a limited sense, given the difficulties of defining the scope of what it includes.\n\nFounding editor James Murray was also reluctant to include scientific terms, despite their documentation, unless he felt that they were widely enough used. In 1902, he declined to add the word \"radium\" to the dictionary.\n\n\n\n"}

He performed many stage, television, radio and film roles. On television, he played David Lloyd George in \"The Life and Times of David Lloyd George\" and the lead role in the detective series \"A Mind to Kill\". His guest roles included multiple appearances in the cult series \"The Avengers\" and \"Doctor Who\", as well as a famous episode of the sitcom \"Dad's Army\". He was also known to be an accomplished linguist.\n\nMadoc was born Philip Arvon Jones near Merthyr Tydfil and attended Cyfarthfa Castle Grammar School, where he was a member of the cricket and rugby teams, and displayed talent as a linguist. He then studied languages at the University of Wales and the University of Vienna. He eventually spoke seven languages, including Russian and Swedish, and had a working knowledge of Huron Indian, Hindi and Mandarin. He worked as an interpreter, but became disenchanted with having to translate for politicians: \"I did dry-as-dust jobs like political interpreting. You get to despise politicians when you have to translate the rubbish they spout.\" He then switched to acting and won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).\n\nMadoc acted on stage with the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing the roles of Iago, Othello and Dr Faust. As a television actor he first gained widespread recognition in two serials, first as the relentless SS Officer Lutzig in the Second World War serial \"Manhunt\" (1969), and then as the vicious Huron warrior Magua in a serialisation of \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1971). He played a character resembling Lutzig, but for comic effect, in \"The Deadly Attachment\", an episode of the comedy \"Dad's Army\" in which he played a U-boat captain held prisoner by the Walmington-on-Sea platoon of the Home Guard. He records names on his \"list\" for the day of reckoning after the war is won, prompting Captain Mainwaring's famous line \"Don't tell him, Pike!\" Madoc's ability to give life to German villains also surfaced in the TV series \"The Fortunes of War\", directed by James Cellan Jones.\n\nHe also appeared in five episodes of the TV series \"The Avengers\" between 1963 and 1969 (\"The Decapod\", \"Six Hands Across a Table\", \"Death of a Batman\", \"The Correct Way to Kill\", \"My Wildest Dream\").\n\nIn 1974 he played a corrupt and lecherous priest, Vicar Davyd, in the BBC Wales serial \"Hawkmoor\".

This series was made simultaneously in Welsh and English from 1994 to 2002. He appeared in episodes of the BBC sitcoms \"The Good Life\" and \"Porridge\" (\"Disturbing The Peace\"), and in a controversial episode of \"The Goodies\" (\"South Africa\"), which satirised Apartheid. He took the lead role in the BBC Wales drama \"The Life and Times of David Lloyd George\".\n\nFilms in which Madoc appeared included \"Operation Crossbow\" (1965), \"The Quiller Memorandum\" (1966), \"Berserk!\" (1967), \"Doppelgänger\" (1969), \"Hell Boats\" (1970), \"Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde\" (1971), \"Soft Beds, Hard Battles\" (1974) and \"Operation Daybreak\" (1975). His later film performances included Leon Trotsky in \"Zina\" (1985), and Jimmy Murphy in the football movie \"Best\" (2000).\n\nMadoc presented an educational 1960s BBC television series, \"Komm mit! Wir sprechen Deutsch: German by television\".\n\nMadoc appeared in the second \"Doctor Who\" film, \"Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.\" (1966) and later in the BBC series itself. He appeared in two Second Doctor serials — \"The Krotons\" where he played Eelek, a high-ranking member of Gond Society, and \"The War Games\", where he played the villainous alien War Lord. In the 1970s he appeared in two Fourth Doctor serials — \"The Brain of Morbius\" and \"The Power of Kroll\". He recorded DVD commentaries for \"The Krotons\", \"The War Games\" and \"The Brain of Morbius\" and was interviewed about his roles in \"Doctor Who\" in the short film \"Philip Madoc - a Villain for All Seasons\", which appeared as an extra on the DVD for \"The Power of Kroll\". In 2003, he guest-starred in the \"Big Finish\" \"Doctor Who\" audio adventure, \"Master\", and returned to Big Finish in the 2008 Sixth Doctor story \"Return of the Krotons\". He voiced the War King in the \"Faction Paradox\" audio series.\n\nHe appeared twice in the drama series \"UFO\", once as the partner of Ed Straker's estranged wife and once as the captain of a British warship under attack by the aliens. In the pilot episode of \"\" (1975) he had a brief appearance as Commander Anton Gorski, who was replaced by Commander John Koenig for the remainder of the series. In addition to his minor role of Anton Gorski, his likeness later appeared in the comic book adaptation of the \"Space 1999\" saga, where his character's previously minor role was expanded upon. He also made a guest appearance in \"Survivors\".\n\nMadoc's voice can be heard reading Bible quotations on a variant of the VoCo alarm clock. He also starred as Ellis Peters's medieval detective Brother Cadfael in the BBC Radio 4 Adaptations of \"Monk's Hood\", \"The Virgin in the Ice\" and \"Dead Man's Ransom\".

He made many contributions to Sikh theology and Sikh literature, he discovered Hemkunt, and he became the \"Sri Mahant\" (head) of the Nirmal Pachchayati Akhara at Kankhal.\n\nPundit Tara Singh was born into a Sikh family who were originally Brahmins. At the age of twenty he left his village, which was near Qadian, and he arrived at the Niramala \"dera\" of Sant Gulab Singh at Kurala, Hoshiarpur. Here he was initiated into the Niramala order and taught the Sikh texts and scriptures. For further learning he went to Amritsar and also to Kashi where he studied Sanskrit and Vedic literature. He then spent some time in the Bengali city of Shantipur. He also attended the Arddha Kumbha 1861 at Haridwar.\n\nHe was now a renowned scholar and had accumulated some fame throughout the region. The Maharaja of Patiala, Maharaja Narinder Singh (1824–1862) gave patronage to him after which Tara Singh came to Patiala and established his own Nirmala dera by the name of Dharam Dhuja and began doing scholarly work. Pundit Tara Singh taught a large group of scholars which include the famous Sikh historian Giani Gain Singh (1822–1921) and Bishan Singh Ji Muralewale of the Damdami Taksal. Sant Attar Singh (1822–1927) also studied from a Nirmala sect during this time. In 1875 Pundit Tara Singh was made the \"Sri Mahant\" (head) of the Nirmal Pachchayati Akhara (Kankhal), the central organisation of the Nirmala sect.\n\nMaharaja Narinder Singh of Patiala commissioned to Pandit Tara Singh Narotam to compile a comprehensive list of all the gurudwaras commemorating the life and work of the Gurus. This work was entitled Sri Gur Tirath Sangrah and published in 1884. Pundit Tara Singh provided the descriptions of 508 different locations and Hemkunt was of one of these.\n\nPundit Tara Singh was the first Sikh to trace the geographical location of Hemkunt Sahib. Using clues from the Bachitar Natak to reveal Guru Gobind Singh's \"tap asthan\" (place of meditation) such as the place was named Sapatsring (seven peaks) and was on or near \"Hemkunt Parbat\" (lake of ice mountain) he set out to explore the Garhwal Himalayas and his search took him to Badrinath and to the nearby village of Pandukeshwar, near the present-day Gobind Ghat. It seems, however, that Narotam's discovery \nwas not heeded by the Sikh community until the twentieth century, when Hemkunt was rediscovered Sohan Singh and Modan Singh.\n\nPundit Tara Singh conforms to the Nirmala school of thought. He presents Sikhism from a Vedantic orientation, and it being a blend of Sankara and Ramanuja. He believed that Guru Nanak Dev was an incarnation of Vishnu and that Waheguru was another name of Vishnu and could not refer to the nirguna concept of God. He wrote extensively about the meaning of Waheguru in his book Waheguru Shabad-Arth Tika. In the Mahan Kosh it is written that Pandit Tara Singh believes that the Sarbloh Granth was produced by Bhai Sukha Singh the head Granthi of Patna Sahib from a manuscript given by an Udasi from Jagannath (Orissa) who said it was Guru Gobind Singh's writing. Pandit Tara Singh also believes that the entire Dasam Granth was written by Guru Gobind Singh.\n\nHe may have written an commentary on the entire SGGS but it is assumed to be lost. His more famous works are Gurmat Nirnay Sagar, Sri Gur Tirath Sangrah and Guru Girarath Kos. Other notable works include a commentary on Bani of the Bhagats included in the Guru Granth Sahib.\n\n"}

{"id": "27698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27698", "title": "Sanskrit", "text": "Sanskrit\n\nSanskrit (; , Sanskrit: संस्कृतम्, also ) is a language of ancient India with a documented history of about 3,500 years. It is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism; the predominant language of most works of Hindu philosophy as well as some of the principal texts of Buddhism and Jainism. Sanskrit, in its various variants and dialects, was the \"lingua franca\" of ancient and medieval India. In the early 1st millennium CE, along with Buddhism and Hinduism, Sanskrit migrated to Southeast Asia, parts of East Asia and Central Asia, emerging as a language of high culture and of local ruling elites in these regions.\n\nSanskrit is an Old Indo-Aryan language. As one of the oldest documented members of the Indo-European family of languages, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. It is related to Greek and Latin, as well as Hittite, Luwian, Old Avestan and many other extinct languages with historical significance to Europe, West Asia and Central Asia. It traces its linguistic ancestry to the Proto-Indo-Aryan language, Proto-Indo-Iranian and the Proto-Indo-European languages.\n\nSanskrit is traceable to the 2nd millennium BCE in a form known as the Vedic Sanskrit, with the \"Rigveda\" as the earliest surviving text. A more refined and standardized grammatical form called the Classical Sanskrit emerged in mid-1st millennium BCE with the \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" treatise of Pāṇini. Sanskrit, though not necessarily Classical Sanskrit, is the root language of many Prakrit languages. Examples include numerous modern daughter Northern Indian subcontinental languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Punjabi and Nepali.\n\nThe body of Sanskrit literature encompasses a rich tradition of philosophical and religious texts, as well as poetry, music, drama, scientific, technical and other texts. In the ancient era, Sanskrit compositions were orally transmitted by methods of memorisation of exceptional complexity, rigour and fidelity. The earliest known inscriptions in Sanskrit are from the 1st-century BCE, such as the few discovered in Ayodhya and Ghosundi-Hathibada (Chittorgarh). Sanskrit texts dated to the 1st millennium CE were written in the Brahmi script, the Nāgarī script, the historic South Indian scripts and their derivative scripts. Sanskrit is one of the 22 languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. It continues to be widely used as a ceremonial and ritual language in Hinduism and some Buddhist practices such as hymns and chants.\n\nThe Sanskrit verbal adjective \"\" is a compound word consisting of \"sams\" (together, good, well, perfected) and \"krta-\" (made, formed, work). It connotes a work that has been \"well prepared, pure and perfect, polished, sacred\". According to Biderman, the perfection contextually being referred to in the etymological origins of the word is its tonal qualities, rather than semantic. Sound and oral transmission were highly valued quality in ancient India, and its sages refined the alphabet, the structure of words and its exacting grammar into a \"collection of sounds, a kind of sublime musical mold\", states Biderman, as an integral language they called Sanskrit. From late Vedic period onwards, state Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus, resonating sound and its musical foundations attracted an \"exceptionally large amount of linguistic, philosophical and religious literature\" in India. The sound was visualized as \"pervading all creation\", another representation of the world itself, the \"mysterious magnum\" of the Hindu thought. The search for perfection in thought and of salvation was one of the dimensions of sacred sound, and the common thread to weave all ideas and inspirations became the quest for what the ancient Indians believed to be a perfect language, the \"phonocentric episteme\" of Sanskrit.\n\nSanskrit as a language competed with numerous less exact vernacular Indian languages called Prakritic languages (\"\"). The term \"prakrta\" literally means \"original, natural, normal, artless\", states Franklin Southworth. The relationship between Prakrit and Sanskrit is found in the Indian texts dated to the 1st millennium CE. Patanjali acknowledged that Prakrit is the first language, one instinctively adopted by every child with all its imperfections and later leads to the problems of interpretation and misunderstanding. The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections. The early Sanskrit grammarian Dandin states, for example, that much in the Prakrit languages is etymologically rooted in Sanskrit but involve \"loss of sounds\" and corruptions that result from a \"disregard of the grammar\". Dandin acknowledged that there are words and confusing structures in Prakrit that thrive independent of Sanskrit. This view is found in the writing of Bharata Muni, the author of the ancient \"Natyasastra\" text. The early Jain scholar Namisadhu acknowledged the difference, but disagreed that the Prakrit language was a corruption of Sanskrit. Namisadhu stated that the Prakrit language was the \"purvam\" (came before, origin) and they came naturally to women and children, that Sanskrit was a refinement of the Prakrit through a \"purification by grammar\".\n\nSanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:\n\nOther Indo-European languages related to Sanskrit include archaic and classical Latin (c. 600 BCE – 100 CE, old Italian), Gothic (archaic Germanic language, c. 350 CE), Old Norse (c. 200 CE and after), Old Avestan (c. late 2nd millennium BCE) and Younger Avestan (c. 900 BCE). The closest ancient relatives of Vedic Sanskrit in the Indo-European languages are the Nuristani language found in the remote Hindu Kush region of the northeastern Afghanistan and northwestern Himalayas, as well as the extinct Avestan and Old Persian – both Iranian languages.\n\nColonial era scholars familiar with Latin and Greek were struck by the resemblance of the Sanskrit language, both its vocabulary and grammar, to the classical languages of Europe. It suggested a common root and historical links between some of the major distant ancient languages of the world. William Jones remarked:\n\nIn order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the Indo-Aryan migration theory states that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the north-west sometime during the early second millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the Baltic and Slavic languages, vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European Uralic languages, and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna. The pre-history of Indo-Aryan languages which preceded Vedic Sanskrit is unclear and various hypotheses place it over a fairly wide limit. According to Thomas Burrow, based on the relationship between various Indo-European languages, the origin of all these languages may possibly be in what is now Central or Eastern Europe, while the Indo-Iranian group possibly arose in Central Russia. The Iranian and Indo-Aryan branches separated quite early. It is the Indo-Aryan branch that moved into eastern Iran and the south into the Indian subcontinent in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. Once in ancient India, the Indo-Aryan language underwent rapid linguistic change and morphed into the Vedic Sanskrit language.\n\nThe pre-Classical form of Sanskrit is known as Vedic Sanskrit. The earliest attested Sanskrit text is the Rigveda, a Hindu scripture, from the mid-to-late second millennium BCE. No written records from such an early period survive if they ever existed. However, scholars are confident that the oral transmission of the texts is reliable: they were ceremonial literature where the exact phonetic expression and its preservation were a part of the historic tradition.\n\nThe \"Rigveda\" is a collection of books, created by multiple authors from distant parts of ancient India. These authors represented different generations, and the mandalas 2 to 7 are the oldest while the mandalas 1 and 10 are relatively the youngest. Yet, the Vedic Sanskrit in these books of the \"Rigveda\" \"hardly presents any dialectical diversity\", states Louis Renou – an Indologist known for his scholarship of the Sanskrit literature and the \"Rigveda\" in particular. According to Renou, this implies that the Vedic Sanskrit language had a \"set linguistic pattern\" by the second half of the 2nd-millennium BCE. Beyond the \"Rigveda\", the ancient literature in Vedic Sanskrit that has survived into the modern age include the \"Samaveda\", \"Yajurveda\", \"Atharvaveda\" along with the embedded and layered Vedic texts such as the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and the early Upanishads. These Vedic documents reflect the dialects of Sanskrit found in the various parts of the northwestern, northern and eastern Indian subcontinent.\n\nVedic Sanskrit was both a spoken and literary language of ancient India. According to Michael Witzel, Vedic Sanskrit was a spoken language of the semi-nomadic Aryas who temporarily settled in one place, maintained cattle herds, practiced limited agriculture and after some time moved by wagon train they called \"grama\". The Vedic Sanskrit language or a closely related Indo-European variant was recognized beyond ancient India as evidenced by the \"Mitanni Treaty\" between the ancient Hittite and Mitanni people, carved into a rock, in a region that are now parts of Syria and Turkey. Parts of this treaty such as the names of the Mitannian princes and technical terms related to horse training, for reasons not understood, are in early forms of Vedic Sanskrit. The treaty also invokes the gods Varuna, Mitra, Indra and Nasatya found in the earliest layers of the Vedic literature.\nThe Vedic Sanskrit found in the \"Rigveda\" is distinctly more archaic than other Vedic texts, and in many respects, the Rigvedic language is notably more similar to those found in the archaic texts of Old Avestan Zoroastrian \"Gathas\" and Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\". According to Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton – Indologists known for their translation of the \"Rigveda\", the Vedic Sanskrit literature \"clearly inherited\" from Indo-Iranian and Indo-European times, the social structures such as the role of the poet and the priests, the patronage economy, the phrasal equations and some of the poetic meters. While there are similarities, state Jamison and Brereton, there are also differences between Vedic Sanskrit, the Old Avestan, and the Mycenaean Greek literature. For example, unlike the Sanskrit similes in the \"Rigveda\", the Old Avestan \"Gathas\" lack simile entirely, and it is rare in the later version of the language. The Homerian Greek, like Rigvedic Sanskrit, deploys simile extensively, but they are structurally very different.\n\nThe early Vedic form of the Sanskrit language was far less homogenous, and it evolved over time into a more structured and homogeneous language, ultimately into the Classical Sanskrit by about the mid-1st-millennium BCE. According to Richard Gombrich – an Indologist and a scholar of Sanskrit Pāli and Buddhist Studies, the archaic Vedic Sanskrit found in the \"Rigveda\" had already evolved in the Vedic period, as evidenced in the later Vedic literature. The language in the early Upanishads of Hinduism and the late Vedic literature approaches Classical Sanskrit, while the archaic Vedic Sanskrit had by the Buddha's time become unintelligible to all except ancient Indian sages, states Gombrich.\n\nThe formalization of the Sanskrit language is credited to , along with Patanjali's \"Mahabhasya\" and Katyayana's commentary that preceded Patanjali's work. Panini composed \"\" (\"Eight-Chapter Grammar\"). The century in which he lived is unclear and debated, but his work is generally accepted to be from sometime between 6th and 4th centuries BCE.\n\nThe was not the first description of Sanskrit grammar, but it is the earliest that has survived in full. Pāṇini cites ten scholars on the phonological and grammatical aspects of the Sanskrit language before him, as well as the variants in the usage of Sanskrit in different regions of India. The ten Vedic scholars he quotes are Apisali, Kashyapa, Gargya, Galava, Cakravarmana, Bharadvaja, Sakatayana, Sakalya, Senaka and Sphotayana. The of Panini became the foundation of Vyākaraṇa, a Vedanga. In the , language is observed in a manner that has no parallel among Greek or Latin grammarians. Pāṇini's grammar, according to Renou and Filliozat, defines the linguistic expression and a classic that set the standard for the Sanskrit language. Pāṇini made use of a technical metalanguage consisting of a syntax, morphology and lexicon. This metalanguage is organised according to a series of meta-rules, some of which are explicitly stated while others can be deduced.\nPāṇini's comprehensive and scientific theory of grammar is conventionally taken to mark the start of Classical Sanskrit. His systematic treatise inspired and made Sanskrit the preeminent Indian language of learning and literature for two millennia. It is unclear whether Pāṇini wrote his treatise on Sanskrit language or he orally created the detailed and sophisticated treatise then transmitted it through his students. Modern scholarship generally accepts that he knew of a form of writing, based on references to words such as \"lipi\" (\"script\") and \"lipikara\" (\"scribe\") in section 3.2 of the \" Aṣṭādhyāyī\".\n\nThe Classical Sanskrit language formalized by Panini, states Renou, is \"not an impoverished language\", rather it is \"a controlled and a restrained language from which archaisms and unnecessary formal alternatives were excluded\". The Classical form of the language simplified the \"sandhi\" rules but retained various aspects of the Vedic language, while adding rigor and flexibilities, so that it had sufficient means to express thoughts as well as being \"capable of responding to the future increasing demands of an infinitely diversified literature\", according to Renou. Panini included numerous \"optional rules\" beyond the Vedic Sanskrit's \"bahulam\" framework, to respect liberty and creativity so that individual writers separated by geography or time would have the choice to express facts and their views in their own way, where tradition followed competitive forms of the Sanskrit language.\n\nThe phonetic differences between Vedic Sanskrit and Classical Sanskrit are negligible when compared to the intense change that must have occurred in the pre-Vedic period between Indo-Aryan language and the Vedic Sanskrit. The noticeable differences between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit include the much-expanded grammar and grammatical categories as well as the differences in the accent, the semantics and the syntax. There are also some differences between how some of the nouns and verbs end, as well as the \"sandhi\" rules, both internal and external. Quite many words found in the early Vedic Sanskrit language are never found in late Vedic Sanskrit or Classical Sanskrit literature, while some words have different and new meanings in Classical Sanskrit when contextually compared to the early Vedic Sanskrit literature.\n\nArthur Macdonell was among the early colonial era scholars who summarized some of the differences between the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit. Louis Renou published in 1956, in French, a more extensive discussion of the similarities, the differences and the evolution of the Vedic Sanskrit within the Vedic period and then to the Classical Sanskrit along with his views on the history. This work has been translated by Jagbans Balbir.\n\nThe earliest known use of the word \"samskrta\" (Sanskrit), in the context of a language, is found in verses 3.16.14 and 5.28.17–19 of the \"Ramayana\". Sanskrit co-existed with numerous other Prakrit languages of ancient India. The Prakrit languages of India also have ancient roots and some Sanskrit scholars have called these \"Apabhramsa\", literally \"spoiled\". The Vedic literature includes words whose phonetic equivalent are not found in other Indo European languages but which are found in the regional Prakrit languages, which makes it likely that the interaction, the sharing of words and ideas began early in the Indian history. As the Indian thought diversified and challenged earlier beliefs of Hinduism, particularly in the form of Buddhism and Jainism, the Prakrit languages such as Pali in Theravada Buddhism and Ardhamagadhi in Jainism competed with Sanskrit in the ancient times. However, states Paul Dundas – a scholar of Jainism, these ancient Prakrit languages had \"roughly the same relationship to Sanskrit as medieval Italian does to Latin.\" The Indian tradition states that the Buddha and the Mahavira preferred Prakrit language so that everyone could understand it. However, scholars such as Dundas have questioned this hypothesis. They state that there is no evidence for this and whatever evidence is available suggests that by the start of the common era, hardly anybody other than learned monks had the capacity to understand the old Prakrit languages such as Ardhamagadhi.\n\nColonial era scholars questioned whether Sanskrit was ever a spoken language, or was it only a literary language? Scholars disagree in their answers. A section of Western scholars state that Sanskrit was never a spoken language, while others and particularly most Indian scholars state the opposite. Those who affirm Sanskrit to have been a vernacular language point to the necessity of Sanskrit being a spoken language for the oral tradition that preserved the vast number of Sanskrit manuscripts from ancient India. Secondly, they state that the textual evidence in the works of Yaksa, Panini and Patanajali affirms that the Classical Sanskrit in their era was a language that is spoken (\"bhasha\") by the cultured and educated. Some \"sutras\" expound upon the variant forms of spoken Sanskrit versus written Sanskrit. The 7th-century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang mentioned in his memoir that official philosophical debates in India were held in Sanskrit, not in the vernacular language of that region.\n\nAccording to Sanskrit linguist Madhav Deshpande, Sanskrit was a spoken language in a colloquial form by the mid 1st millennium BCE which coexisted with a more formal, grammatical correct form of literary Sanskrit. This, states Deshpande, is true for modern languages where colloquial incorrect approximations and dialects of a language are spoken and understood, along with more \"refined, sophisticated and grammatically accurate\" forms of the same language being found in the literary works. The Indian tradition, states Moriz Winternitz, has favored the learning and the usage of multiple languages from the ancient times. Sanskrit was a spoken language in the educated and the elite classes, but it was also a language that must have been understood in a more wider circle of society because the widely popular folk epics and stories such as the \"Ramayana\", the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", the \"Panchatantra\" and many other texts are all in the Sanskrit language. The Classical Sanskrit with its exacting grammar was thus the language of the Indian scholars and the educated classes, while others communicated with approximate or ungrammatical variants of it as well as other natural Indian languages. Sanskrit, as the learned language of Ancient India, thus existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits. Many Sanskrit dramas indicate that the language coexisted with the vernacular Prakrits. Centres in Varanasi, Paithan, Pune and Kanchipuram were centers of classical Sanskrit learning and public debates until the arrival of the colonial era.\n\nAccording to Étienne Lamotte – an Indologist and Buddhism scholar, Sanskrit became the dominant literary and inscriptional language because of its precision in communication. It was, states Lamotte, an ideal instrument for presenting ideas and as knowledge in Sanskrit multiplied so did its spread and influence. Sanskrit was adopted voluntarily as a vehicle of high culture, arts, and profound ideas. Pollock disagrees with Lamotte, but concurs that Sanskrit's influence grew into what he terms as \"Sanskrit Cosmopolis\" over a region that included all of South Asia and much of southeast Asia. The Sanskrit language cosmopolis thrived beyond India between 300 and 1300 CE.\n\nSanskrit has been the predominant language of Hindu texts encompassing a rich tradition of philosophical and religious texts, as well as poetry, music, drama, scientific, technical and others. It is the predominant language of one of the largest collection of historic manuscripts. The earliest known inscriptions in Sanskrit are from the 1st-century BCE, such as the Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana and Ghosundi-Hathibada (Chittorgarh).\n\nThough developed and nurtured by scholars of orthodox schools of Hinduism, Sanskrit has been the language for some of the key literary works and theology of heterodox schools of Indian philosophies such as Buddhism and Jainism. The structure and capabilities of the Classical Sanskrit language launched ancient Indian speculations about \"the nature and function of language\", what is the relationship between words and their meanings in the context of a community of speakers, whether this relationship is objective or subjective, discovered or is created, how individuals learn and relate to the world around them through language, and about the limits of language? They speculated on the role of language, the ontological status of painting word-images through sound, and the need for rules so that it can serve as a means for a community of speakers, separated by geography or time, to share and understand profound ideas from each other. These speculations became particularly important to the Mimamsa and the Nyaya schools of Hindu philosophy, and later to Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism, states Frits Staal – a scholar of Linguistics with a focus on Indian philosophies and Sanskrit. Though written in a number of different scripts, the dominant language of Hindu texts has been Sanskrit. It or a hybrid form of Sanskrit became the preferred language of Mahayana Buddhism scholarship. One of the early and influential Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna (~200 CE), for example, used Classical Sanskrit as the language for his texts. According to Renou, Sanskrit had a limited role in the Theravada tradition (formerly known as the Hinayana) but the Prakrit works that have survived are of doubtful authenticity. Some of the canonical fragments of the early Buddhist traditions, discovered in the 20th-century, suggest the early Buddhist traditions did use of imperfect and reasonably good Sanskrit, sometimes with a Pali syntax, states Renou. The Mahāsāṃghika and Mahavastu, in their late Hinayana forms, used hybrid Sanskrit for their literature. Sanskrit was also the language of some of the oldest surviving, authoritative and much followed philosophical works of Jainism such as the \"Tattvartha Sutra\" by Umaswati.\nThe Sanskrit language has been one of the major means for the transmission of knowledge and ideas in Asian history. Indian texts in Sanskrit were already in China by 402 CE, carried by the influential Buddhist pilgrim Faxian who translated them into Chinese by 418 CE. Xuanzang, another Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, learnt Sanskrit in India and carried 657 Sanskrit texts to China in the 7th-century where he established a major center of learning and language translation under the patronage of Emperor Taizong. By the early 1st millennium CE, Sanskrit had spread Buddhist and Hindu ideas to Southeast Asia, parts of the East Asia and the Central Asia. It was accepted as a language of high culture and the preferred language by some of the local ruling elites in these regions. According to the Dalai Lama, the Sanskrit language is a parent language that is at the foundation of many modern languages of India and the one that promoted Indian thought to other distant countries. In Tibetan Buddhism, states the Dalai Lama, Sanskrit language has been a revered one and called \"legjar lhai-ka\" or \"elegant language of the gods\". It has been the means of transmitting the \"profound wisdom of Buddhist philosophy\" to Tibet.\n\nThe Sanskrit language created a pan-Indic accessibility to information and knowledge in the ancient and medieval times, in contrast to the Prakrit languages which were understood just regionally. It created a cultural bond across the subcontinent. As local languages and dialects evolved and diversified, Sanskrit served as the common language. It connected scholars from distant parts of the Indian subcontinent such as Tamil Nadu and Kashmir, states Deshpande, as well as those from different fields of studies, though there must have been differences in its pronunciation given the first language of the respective speakers. The Sanskrit language brought Indic people together, particularly its elite scholars. Some of these scholars of Indian history regionally produced vernacularized Sanskrit to reach wider audiences, as evidenced by texts discovered in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. Once the audience became familiar with the easier to understand vernacularized version of Sanskrit, those interested could graduate from colloquial Sanskrit to the more advanced Classical Sanskrit. Rituals and the rites-of-passage ceremonies have been and continue to be the other occasions where a wide spectrum of people hear Sanskrit, and occasionally join in to speak some Sanskrit words such as \"namah\".\n\nClassical Sanskrit is the standard register as laid out in the grammar of , around the fourth century BCE. Its position in the cultures of Greater India is akin to that of Latin and Ancient Greek in Europe. Sanskrit has significantly influenced most modern languages of the Indian subcontinent, particularly the languages of the northern, western, central and eastern Indian subcontinent.\n\nSanskrit declined starting about and after the 13th-century. This coincides with the beginning of Islamic invasions of the Indian subcontinent to create, thereafter expand the Muslim rule in the form of Sultanates and later the Mughal Empire. With the fall of Kashmir around the 13th-century, a premier center of Sanskrit literary creativity, Sanskrit literature there disappeared, perhaps in the \"fires that periodically engulfed the capital of Kashmir\" or the \"Mongol invasion of 1320\" states Sheldon Pollock. The Sanskrit literature which was once widely disseminated out of the northwest regions of the subcontinent, stopped after the 12th-century. As Hindu kingdoms fell in the eastern and the South India, such as the great Vijayanagara Empire, so did Sanskrit. There were exceptions and short periods of imperial support for Sanskrit, mostly concentrated during the reign of the tolerant Mughal emperor Akbar. Muslim rulers patronized the Middle Eastern language and scripts found in Persia and Arabia, and the Indians linguistically adapted to this Persianization to gain employment with the Muslim rulers. Hindu rulers such as Shivaji of the Maratha Empire, reversed the process, by re-adopting Sanskrit and re-asserting their socio-linguistic identity. After Islamic rule disintegrated in the Indian subcontinent and the colonial rule era began, Sanskrit re-emerged but in the form of a \"ghostly existence\" in regions such as Bengal. This decline was the result of \"political institutions and civic ethos\" that did not support the historic Sanskrit literary culture.\n\nScholars are divided on whether or when Sanskrit died. Western authors such as John Snelling state that Sanskrit and Pali are both dead Indian languages. Indian authors such as M Ramakrishnan Nair state that Sanskrit was a dead language by the 1st millennium BCE. Sheldon Pollock states that in some crucial way, \"Sanskrit is dead\". After the 12th-century, the Sanskrit literary works were reduced to \"reinscription and restatements\" of ideas already explored, and any creativity was restricted to hymns and verses. This contrasted with the previous 1,500 years when \"great experiments in moral and aesthetic imagination\" marked the Indian scholarship using Classical Sanskrit, states Pollock.\n\nOther scholars state that Sanskrit language did not die, only declined. Hanneder disagrees with Pollock, finding his arguments elegant but \"often arbitrary\". According to Hanneder, a decline or regional absence of creative and innovative literature constitutes a negative evidence to Pollock's hypothesis, but it is not positive evidence. A closer look at Sanskrit in the Indian history after the 12th-century suggests that Sanskrit survived despite the odds. According to Hanneder,\n\nThe Sanskrit language, states Moriz Winternitz, was never a dead language and it is still alive though its prevalence is lesser than ancient and medieval times. Sanskrit remains an integral part of Hindu journals, festivals, Ramlila plays, drama, rituals and the rites-of-passage. Similarly, Brian Hatcher states that the \"metaphors of historical rupture\" by Pollock are not valid, that there is ample proof that Sanskrit was very much alive in the narrow confines of surviving Hindu kingdoms between the 13th and 18th-century, and its reverence and tradition continues.\n\nHanneder states that modern works in Sanskrit are either ignored or their \"modernity\" contested. According to Robert Goldman and Sally Sutherland, Sanskrit is neither \"dead\" nor \"living\" in the conventional sense. It is a special, timeless language that lives in the numerous manuscripts, daily chants and ceremonial recitations, a heritage language that Indians contextually prize and some practice.\n\nWhen the British introduced English to India in the 19th century, knowledge of Sanskrit and ancient literature continued to flourish as the study of Sanskrit changed from a more traditional style into a form of analytical and comparative scholarship mirroring that of Europe.\n\nThe relationship of Sanskrit to the Prakrit languages, particularly the modern form of Indian languages, is complex and spans about 3,500 years, states Colin Masica – a linguist specializing in South Asian languages. A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency of anachronistic errors. Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE-600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE-1000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE-current), each can further be subdivided in early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.\n\nVedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions – archaic and more formalized – that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE-1000 CE period. Two literary Indic languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are Apabhramsa and Elu (a form of literary Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.\n\nThere is an extensive overlap in the vocabulary, phonetics and other aspects of these New Indo-Aryan languages with Sanskrit, but it is neither universal nor identical across the languages. They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins. Prakrit languages do have a grammatical structure, but like the Vedic Sanskrit, it is far less rigorous than Classical Sanskrit. The roots of all Prakrit languages may be in the Vedic Sanskrit and ultimately the Indo-Aryan language, their structural details vary from the Classical Sanskrit. It is generally accepted by scholars and widely believed in India that the modern Indic languages, such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi are descendants of the Sanskrit language. Sanskrit, states Burjor Avari, can be described as \"the mother language of almost all the languages of north India\".\n\nThe Sanskrit language's historic presence is attested across a wide geography beyond the Indian subcontinent. Inscriptions and literary evidence suggests that Sanskrit language was already being adopted in Southeast Asia and Central Asia in the 1st-millennium CE, through monks, religious pilgrims and merchants.\n\nThe Indian subcontinent has been the geographic range of the largest collection of the ancient and pre-18th century Sanskrit manuscripts and inscriptions. Beyond ancient India, significant collections of Sanskrit manuscripts and inscriptions have been found in China (particularly the Tibetan monasteries), Myanmar, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. Sanskrit inscriptions, manuscripts or its remnants, including some of the oldest known Sanskrit written texts, have been discovered in dry high deserts and mountainous terrains such as in Nepal, Tibet, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan. Some Sanskrit texts and inscriptions have also been discovered in Korea and Japan.\n\nSanskrit is a studied school subject in contemporary India, but scarce as a first language. In the 2001 Census of India, 14,135 Indians reported Sanskrit to be their first language. In the 2011 census, 24,821 people out of about 1.21 billion reported Sanskrit to be their first language.\nAccording to the 2011 national census of Nepal, 1,669 people use Sanskrit as their first language.\nHowever, on investigation, none of these claims have been verified.\n\nIn India, Sanskrit is among the 22 official languages of India in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. The state of Uttarakhand in India lists Sanskrit as its second official language.\n\nSanskrit shares many Proto-Indo-European phonological features, although it features a larger inventory of distinct phonemes. The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated \"Th\", to the voiceless \"T\", voiced \"D\" and voiced aspirated \"Dh\" found in PIE languages.\n\nThe most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel-merger, states Stephanie Jamison – an Indo-European linguist specializing in Sanskrit literature. The short ∗e, ∗o and *a, all merge as \"a\" (अ) in Sanskrit, while long ∗ē, ∗ō and *ā, all merge as long \"ā\" (आ). These mergers occurred very early and significantly impacted Sanskrit's morphological system. Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. However, the secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit, states Jamison. A series of retroflex dental stops were innovated in Sanskrit to more thoroughly articulate sounds for clarity. For example, unlike the loss of the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed ∗y, ∗w, and ∗s intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.\n\nThe cardinal vowels (\"svaras\") \"i\" (इ), \"u\" (उ), \"a\" (अ) distinguish length in Sanskrit, states Jamison. The short \"a\" (अ) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than ā, equivalent to schwa. The mid vowels ē (ए) and ō (ओ) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs ∗ai and ∗au. The Old Iranian language preserved *ai and ∗au. In contrast, in Sanskrit, they are inherently long. The vocalic liquid r̥ in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE ∗r̥ and ∗l̥. The long r̥ is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.\n\nAccording to Masica, Sanskrit has four traditional semivowels, with which were classed, \"for morphophonemic reasons, the liquids: y, r, l, and v; that is, as y and v were the non-syllabics corresponding to i, u, so were r, l in relation to r̥ and l̥\". The northwestern, the central and the eastern Sanskrit dialects have had a historic confusion between \"r\" and \"l\". The Paninian system that followed the central dialect preserved the distinction, likely out of reverence for the Vedic Sanskrit that distinguished the \"r\" and \"l\". However, the northwestern dialect only had \"r\", while the eastern dialect probably only had \"l\", states Masica. Thus literary works from different parts of ancient India appear inconsistent in their use of \"r\" and \"l\", resulting in doublets that is occasionally semantically differentiated.\n\nSanskrit possesses a symmetric consonantal phoneme structure based on how the sound is articulated, though the actual usage of these sounds conceals the lack of parallelism in the apparent symmetry possibly from historical changes within the language. The glides and liquids regularly alternate with vowels in Sanskrit, for example, i ≈ y; u ≈ v ([w]); r̥ ≈ r ; l̥ ≈ l, states Jamison.\n\nSanskrit had a series of retroflex stops. All the retroflexes in Sanskrit are in \"origin conditioned alternants of dentals, though from the beginning of the language they have a qualified independence\", states Jamison.\n\nThe palatals are affricates in Sanskrit, not stops. The palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents. The \"anusvara\" that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of postvocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions. Its \"visarga\" is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.\nThe voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is significantly rarer than the other three series.\n\nWhile the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three, states Jamison, is the retroflex sibilant .s being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k (mnemonically \"ruki\").\n\nSanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through \"sandhi\" rules (literally, the rules of \"putting together, union, connection, alliance\"). This is similar to the English alteration of \"going to\" as \"gonna\", states Jamison. The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the \"sandhi\" of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external \"sandhi\" rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization. Among the consonants, most external \"sandhi\" rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. According to Jamison, these rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries. In Vedic Sanskrit, the external \"sandhi\" rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.\n\nThe internal \"sandhi\" rules are more intricate and account for the root and the canonical structure of the Sanskrit word. These rules anticipate what are now known as the Bartholomae's law and Grassmann's law. For example, states Jamison, the \"voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated obstruents of a positional series regularly alternate with each other (p ≈ b ≈ bh; t ≈ d ≈ dh, etc.; note, however, c ≈ j ≈ h), such that, for example, a morpheme with an underlying voiced aspirate final may show alternants with all three stops under differing internal sandhi conditions\". The velar series (k, g, gh) alternate with the palatal series (c, j, h), while the structural position of the palatal series is modified into a retroflex cluster when followed by dental. This rule create two morphophonemically distinct series from a single palatal series.\n\nVocalic alternations in the Sanskrit morphological system is termed \"strengthening\", and called \"guna\" and \"vriddhi\" in the preconsonantal versions. There is an equivalence to terms deployed in Indo-European descriptive grammars, wherein Sanskrit's unstrengthened state is same as the zero-grade, \"guna\" corresponds to normal-grade, while \"vriddhi\" is same as the lengthened-state. The qualitative ablaut is not found in Sanskrit just like it is absent in Iranian, but Sanskrit retains quantitative ablaut through vowel strengthening. The transformations between unstrengthened to \"guna\" is prominent in the morphological system, states Jamison, while \"vriddhi\" is a particularly significant rule when adjectives of origin and appurtenance are derived. The manner in which this is done slightly differs between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit.\n\nSanskrit grants a very flexible syllable structure, where they may begin or end with vowels, be single consonants or clusters. Similarly, the syllable may have an internal vowel of any weight. The Vedic Sanskrit shows traces of following the Sievers-Edgerton Law, but Classical Sanskrit doesn't. Vedic Sanskrit has a pitch accent system, states Jamison, which were acknowledged by Panini, but in his Classical Sanskrit the accents disappear. Most Vedic Sanskrit words have one accent. However, this accent is not phonologically predictable, states Jamison. It can fall anywhere in the word and its position often conveys morphological and syntactic information. According to Masica, the presence of an accent system in Vedic Sanskrit is evidenced from the markings in the Vedic texts. This is important because of Sanskrit's connection to the PIE languages and comparative Indo-European linguistics.\n\nSanskrit, like most early Indo-European languages, lost the so-called \"laryngeal consonants (cover-symbol ∗H) present in the Proto-Indo-European\", states Jamison. This significantly impacted the evolutionary path of the Sanskrit phonology and morphology, particularly in the variant forms of roots.\n\nThe basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, \"a morpheme bearing lexical meaning\". The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the \"three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively\".\n\nA Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:\n\nThe root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a \"root\" is that it does not end in a short \"a\" (अ) and that it is monosyllabic. In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment \"a-\" added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the \"-na/n-\" infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.\n\nA verb in Sanskrit has the following canonical structure:\n\nAccording to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English. Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to \"who is doing it\" (person or persons), \"when it is done\" (tense) and \"how it is done\" (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.\n\nBoth verbs and nouns in Sanskrit are either thematic or athematic, states Jamison. \"Guna\" (strengthened) forms in the active singular regularly alternate in athematic verbs. The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.\n\nThese elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the \"Rigveda\" preverbs regularly occur in tmesis, states Jamison, which means they are \"separated from the finite verb\". This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit's attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, \"preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms\".\n\nWhile roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure. A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as \"mātar-\" (mother), \"nas-\" (nose), \"śvan-\" (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.\n\nThe Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison. Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.\n\nStems, that is \"root + affix\", appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, \"Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions\". Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types. The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four Paninian components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the \"Astadhyaayi\", a comprehensive system of 4000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; \"Sivasutras\", an inventory of \"anubandhas\" (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the \"pratyharas\" technique; \"Dhatupatha\", a list of 2000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the \"Ganapatha\", an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems. There are peripheral adjuncts to these four, such as the \"Unadisutras\", which focus on irregularly formed derivatives from the roots.\n\nSanskrit morphology is generally studied in two broad fundamental categories: the nominal forms and the verbal forms. These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context. Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and \"nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings\".\n\nThe Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past aorist and past perfect. It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle. The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as \"parasmaipada\" (word for another) and \"atmanepada\" (word for oneself).\n\nThe paradigm for the tense-aspect system in Sanskrit is the three-way contrast between the \"present\", the \"aorist\" and the \"perfect\" architecture. Vedic Sanskrit is more elaborate and had several additional tenses. For example, the \"Rigveda\" includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the \"present\" system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the \"aorist\" stems retain the aorist tense and the \"perfect\" stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect. The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-apsect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.\n\nSanskrit recognizes three numbers – singular, dual, and plural. The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition. Illustrations include \"dyāvā\" (literally, \"the two heavens\" for heaven-and-earth), \"mātarā\" (literally, \"the two mothers\" for mother-and-father). A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of \"I\", \"you\", \"he/she/it\", \"we\" and \"they\".\n\nThere are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third. Sanskrit uses the 3x3 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.\n\nThe Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter. All nouns have inherent gender, but with some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns. Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the \"-ā-\" (आ, Rādhā) and \"-ī-\" (ई, Rukmīnī). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional. Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.\n\nPronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives. Examples of the former include \"ahám\" (first singular), \"vayám\" (first plural) and \"yūyám\" (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric. Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the \"sá/tám\" pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.\n\nIndicative, potential and imperative are the three mood forms in Sanskrit. \n\nThe Sanskrit language formally incorporates poetic metres. By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study and it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature including the later Vedic texts. This study of Sanskrit prosody is called \"chandas\" and considered as one of the six Vedangas, or limbs of Vedic studies.\n\nSanskrit prosody includes linear and non-linear systems. The system started off with seven major metres, according to Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus, called the \"seven birds\" or \"seven mouths of Brihaspati\", and each had its own rhythm, movements and aesthetics wherein a non-linear structure (aperiodicity) was mapped into a four verse polymorphic linear sequence. A syllable in Sanskrit is classified as either \"laghu\" (light) or \"guru\" (heavy). This classification is based on a \"matra\" (literally, \"count, measure, duration\"), and typically a syllable that ends in a short vowel is a light syllable, while those that end in consonant, \"anusvara\" or \"visarga\" are heavy. The classical Sanskrit found in Hindu scriptures such as the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and many texts are so arranged that the light and heavy syllables in them follow a rhythm, though not necessarily a rhyme.\n\nSanskrit metres include those based on a fixed number of syllables per verse, and those based on fixed number of morae per verse. The Vedic Sanskrit employs fifteen metres, of which seven are common, and the most frequent are three (8-, 11- and 12-syllable lines). The Classical Sanskrit deploys both linear and non-linear metres, many of which are based on syllables and others based on diligently crafted verses based on repeating numbers of morae (matra per foot).\nMeter and rhythm is an important part of the Sanskrit language. It may have played a role in helping preserve the integrity of the message and Sanskrit texts. The verse perfection in the Vedic texts such as the verse Upanishads and post-Vedic Smriti texts are rich in prosody. This feature of the Sanskrit language led some Indologists from the 19th century onwards to identify suspected portions of texts where a line or sections are off the expected metre.\n\nThe meter-feature of the Sanskrit language embeds another layer of communication to the listener or reader. A change in metres has been a tool of literary architecture and an embedded code to inform the reciter and audience that it marks the end of a section or chapter. Each section or chapter of these texts uses identical metres, rhythmically presenting their ideas and making it easier to remember, recall and check for accuracy. Authors coded a hymn's end by frequently using a verse of a metre different than that used in the hymn's body. However, The Hindu tradition does not use the Gayatri metre to end a hymn or composition, possibly because it has enjoyed a special level of reverence in Hinduism.\n\nThe early history of writing Sanskrit and other languages in ancient India is a problematic topic despite a century of scholarship, states Richard Salomon – an epigraphist and Indologist specializing in Sanskrit and Pali literature. The earliest script from the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley Civilization (3rd/2nd millennium BCE), but this script remains undeciphered. Of the Vedic period that appeared after the Indus Valley Civilization, if any scripts for Vedic Sanskrit existed, they have not survived. Scholars generally accept that Sanskrit originated in an oral society, and that an oral tradition preserved the extensive Vedic and Classical Sanskrit literature. Other scholars such as Jack Goody state that the Vedic Sanskrit texts are not the product of an oral society, basing this view by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek, Serbian and other cultures, then noting that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations, without being written down.\n\n\"Lipi\" is the term in Sanskrit which means \"writing, letters, alphabet\". It contextually refers to scripts, the art or any manner of writing or drawing. The term, in the sense of a writing system, appears in some of the earliest Buddhist, Hindu and Jaina texts. Pāṇini's \"Astadhyayi\" composed sometime around the 5th- or 4th-century BCE, for example, mentions \"lipi\" in the context of a writing script and education system in his times, but he does not name the script. Several early Buddhist and Jaina texts, such as the \"Lalitavistara Sūtra\" and \"Pannavana Sutta\" include lists of numerous writing scripts in ancient India. However, the reliability of these lists has been questioned and the empirical evidence of writing systems in the form of Sanskrit or Prakrit inscriptions dated prior to the 3rd-century BCE has not been found. If the ancient surface for writing Sanskrit was palm leaves, tree bark and cloth – the same as those in later times, these have not survived. According to Salomon, many find it difficult to explain the \"evidently high level of political organization and cultural complexity\" of ancient India without a writing system for Sanskrit and other languages.\n\nThe oldest datable writing systems for Sanskrit are the Brāhmī script, the related Kharoṣṭhī script and the Brahmi derivatives. The Kharosthi was used in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent and it became extinct, while the Brahmi was used in all over the subcontinent along with regional scripts such as Old Tamil. Of these, the earliest records in the Sanskrit language are in Brahmi, a script that later evolved into numerous related Indic scripts for Sanskrit, along with Southeast Asian scripts (Burmese, Thai, Lao, Khmer, others) and many extinct Central Asian scripts such as those discovered along with the Kharosthi in the Tarim Basin of western China and in Uzbekistan. The most extensive inscriptions that have survived into the modern era are the rock edicts and pillar inscriptions of the 3rd-century BCE Mauryan emperor Ashoka, but these are not in Sanskrit.\n\nSanskrit is written very precisely, states Ruppel. For every sound, it has one sign only, and each Sanskrit sign always represents the same sound. This phonetic aspect of Sanskrit distinguishes it from many of the world's languages. The basic graphic unit of Sanskrit is the \"aksara\", or syllable. All consonants are equal in Sanskrit and it does not have capital and small letters, such as the \"A\" and \"a\" in English. However, vowels do not have an independent status in Sanskrit, unlike English and several other Indo-European languages. In Sanskrit, vowels co-exist with the consonants in order to achieve phonetic clarity. The Vedic Sanskrit hymn II.2.4 of the \"Aitereya Aranyaka\" explains the consonants to be the body of a verse, the vowels to be its soul (voice), and the sibilants as its breath. This intimate relationship between the vowels and the consonants are embedded in the numerous writing scripts for the Sanskrit language.\n\nThe Brahmi script for writing Sanskrit is a \"modified consonant-syllabic\" script. The graphic syllable is its basic unit, and this consists of a consonant with or without diacritic modifications. Since the vowel is an integral part of the consonants, and given the efficiently compacted, fused consonant cluster morphology for Sanskrit words and grammar, the Brahmi and its derivative writing systems deploy ligatures, diacritics and relative positioning of the vowel to inform the reader how the vowel is related to the consonant and how it is expected to be pronounced for clarity. This feature of Brahmi and its modern Indic script derivatives makes it difficult to classify it under the main script types used for the writing systems for most of the world's languages, namely logographic, syllabic and alphabetic.\n\nThe Brahmi script evolved into \"a vast number of forms and derivatives\", states Richard Salomon, and in theory, Sanskrit \"can be represented in virtually any of the main Brahmi-based scripts and in practice it often is\". Sanskrit does not have a native script. Being a phonetic language, it can be written in any precise script that efficiently maps unique human sounds to unique symbols. From the ancient times, it has been written in numerous regional scripts in South and Southeast Asia. Most of these are descendants of the Brahmi script. The earliest datable \"varnamala\" Brahmi alphabet system, found in later Sanskrit texts, is from the 2nd-century BCE, in the form of terracotta plaques found in Haryana. It shows a \"schoolboy's writing lessons\", states Salomon.\n\nMany modern era manuscripts are written and available in the Nagari script, whose form is attestable to the 1st millennium CE. The Nagari script is the ancestor of Devanagari (north India), Nandinagari (south India) and other variants. The Nāgarī script was in regular use by 7th century CE, and had fully evolved into Devanagari and Nandinagari scripts by about the end of the first millennium of the common era. The Devanagari script, states Banerji, became more popular for Sanskrit in India since about the 18th-century. However, Sanskrit does have special historical connection to the Nagari script as attested by the epigraphical evidence. \nThe Nagari script has been thought as a north Indian script for Sanskrit as well as the regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi and Nepali. However, it has had a \"supra-local\" status as evidenced by 1st-millennium CE epigraphy and manuscripts discovered all over India and as far as Sri Lanka, Burma, Indonesia and in its parent form called the Siddhamatrka script found in manuscripts of East Asia. The Sanskrit and Balinese languages Sanur inscription on Belanjong pillar of Bali (Indonesia), dated to about 914 CE, is in part in the Nagari script.\n\nThe Nagari script used for Classical Sanskrit has the fullest repertoire of characters consisting of fourteen vowels and thirty three consonants. For the Vedic Sanskrit, it has two more allophonic consonantal characters (the intervocalic ळ \"ḷa\", and ळ्ह \"ḷha\"). To communicate phonetic accuracy, it also includes several modifiers such as the \"anusvara\" dot and the \"visarga\" double dot, punctuation symbols and others such as the \"halanta\" sign.\n\nOther scripts such as Gujarati, Bangla, Odia and major south Indian scripts, states Salomon, \"have been and often still are used in their proper territories for writing Sanskrit\". These and many Indian scripts look different to the untrained eye, but the differences between Indic scripts is \"mostly superficial and they share the same phonetic repertoire and systemic features\", states Salomon. They all have essentially the same set of eleven to fourteen vowels and thirty-three consonants as established by the Sanskrit language and attestable in the Brahmi script. Further, a closer examination reveals that they all have the similar basic graphic principles, the same \"varnamala\" (literally, \"garland of letters\") alphabetic ordering following the same logical phonetic order, easing the work of historic skilled scribes writing or reproducing Sanskrit works across the Indian subcontinent. The Sanskrit language written in some Indic scripts exaggerate angles or round shapes, but this serves only to mask the underlying similarities. Nagari script favours symmetry set with squared outlines and right angles. In contrast, Sanskrit written in the Bangla script emphasizes the acute angles while the neighbouring Odia script emphasizes rounded shapes and uses cosmetically appealing \"umbrella-like curves\" above the script symbols.\n\nIn the south, where Dravidian languages predominate, scripts used for Sanskrit include the Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Grantha alphabets.\n\nSince the late 18th century, Sanskrit has been transliterated using the Latin alphabet. The system most commonly used today is the IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration), which has been the academic standard since 1888. ASCII-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing Sanskrit characters in computer systems. These include Harvard-Kyoto and ITRANS, a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of Unicode-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online. It is also possible to type using an alphanumeric keyboard and transliterate to Devanagari using software like Mac OS X's international support.\n\nEuropean scholars in the 19th century generally preferred Devanagari for the transcription and reproduction of whole texts and lengthy excerpts. However, references to individual words and names in texts composed in European Languages were usually represented with Roman transliteration. From the 20th century onwards, because of production costs, textual editions edited by Western scholars have mostly been in Romanised transliteration.\n\nThe earliest known stone inscriptions in Sanskrit are in the Brahmi script from the first century BCE. These include the Ayodhyā (Uttar Pradesh) and Hāthībādā-Ghosuṇḍī (near Chittorgarh, Rajasthan) inscriptions. Both of these, states Salomon, are \"essentially standard\" and \"correct Sanskrit\", with a few exceptions reflecting an \"informal Sanskrit usage\". Other important Hindu inscriptions dated to the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, in relatively accurate classical Sanskrit and Brahmi script are the Yavanarajya inscription on a red sandstone slab and the long Naneghat inscription on the wall of a cave rest stop in the Western Ghats.\n\nBesides these few examples from the 1st century BCE, the earliest Sanskrit and hybrid dialect inscriptions are found in Mathura (Uttar Pradesh). These date to the 1st and 2nd-century CE, states Salomon, from the time of the Saka Ksatrapas of the early Kushan Empire. These are also in the Brahmi script. The earliest of these, states Salomon, are attributed to Ksatrapa Sodasa from the early years of 1st-century CE. Of the Mathura inscriptions, the most significant is the Mora Well Inscription. In a manner similar to the Hathibada inscription, the Mora well inscription is a dedication inscription and is linked to the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. It mentions a stone shrine (temple), pratima (murti, images) and calls the five Vrishnis as \"bhagavatam\". There are many other Mathura Sanskrit inscriptions in Brahmi script overlapping the era of Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps and early Kushanas. Other significant 1st-century inscriptions in reasonably good classical Sanskrit in the Brahmi script include the Vasu Doorjamb Inscription and the Mountain Temple inscription. The early ones are related to the Brahmanical, except for the inscription from Kankali Tila which may be Jaina, but none are Buddhist. A few of the later inscriptions from the 2nd-century CE include Buddhist Sanskrit, while others are in \"more or less\" standard Sanskrit and related to the Brahmanical tradition.\nIn Maharashtra and Gujarat, Brahmi script Sanskrit inscriptions from the early centuries of the common era exist at the Nasik Caves site, near the Girnar mountain of Junagadh and elsewhere such as at Kanakhera, Kanheri, and Gunda. The Nasik inscription dates to the mid 1st century CE, is a fair approximation of standard Sanskrit and has hybrid features. The Junagadh rock inscription of Western Satraps ruler Rudradaman I (c. 150 CE, Gujarat) is the first long poetic-style inscription in \"more or less\" standard Sanskrit that has survived into the modern era. It represents a turning point in the history of Sanskrit epigraphy, states Salomon. Though no similar inscriptions are found for about two hundred years after the Rudradaman reign, it is important because its style is the prototype of the eulogy-style Sanskrit inscriptions found in the Gupta Empire era. These inscriptions are also in the Brahmi script. \n\nThe Nagarjunakonda inscriptions are the earliest known substantial South Indian Sanskrit inscriptions, probably from the late 3rd-century or early 4th-century CE, or both. These inscriptions are related to Buddhism and the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism. A few of these inscriptions from both traditions are verse-style in the classical Sanskrit language, while some such as the pillar inscription is written in prose and a hybridized Sanskrit language. An earlier hybrid Sanskrit inscription found on Amaravati slab is dated to the late 2nd-century, while a few later ones include Sanskrit inscriptions along with Prakrit inscriptions related to Hinduism and Buddhism. After the 3rd-century CE, Sanskrit inscriptions dominate and many have survived. Between the 4th and 7th-century CE, south Indian inscriptions are exclusively in the Sanskrit language. In the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, scholars report minor Sanskrit inscriptions from the 2nd-century, these being fragments and scattered. The earliest substantial true Sanskrit language inscription of Susuniya (West Bengal) is dated to the 4th-century. Elsewhere, such as Dehradun (Uttarakhand), inscriptions in more or less correct classical Sanskrit inscriptions are dated to the 3rd-century. \n\nAccording to Salomon, the 4th-century reign of Samudragupta was the turning point when the classical Sanskrit language became established as the \"epigraphic language par excellence\" of the Indian world. These Sanskrit language inscriptions are either \"donative\" or \"panegyric\" records. Generally in accurate classical Sanskrit, they deploy a wide range of regional Indic writing systems extant at the time. They record the donation of a temple or stupa, images, land, monasteries, pilgrim's travel record, public infrastructure such as water reservoir and irrigation measures to prevent famine. Others praise the king or the donor in lofty poetic terms. The Sanskrit language of these inscriptions is written on stone, various metals, terracotta, wood, crystal, ivory, shell and cloth.\n\nThe evidence of the use of the Sanskrit language in Indic writing systems appears in southeast Asia in the first half of the 1st-millennium CE. A few of these in Vietnam are bilingual where both the Sanskrit and the local language is written in the Indian alphabet. Early Sanskrit language inscriptions in Indic writing systems are dated to the 4th-century in Malaysia, 5th to 6th-century in Thailand near Si Thep and the Sak River, early 5th-century in Kutai (east Borneo) and mid 5th-century in west Java (Indonesia). Both major writing systems for Sanskrit, the North Indian and South Indian scripts, have been discovered in southeast Asia, but the Southern variety with its rounded shapes are far more common. The Indic scripts, particularly the Pallava script prototype, spread and ultimately evolved into Mon-Burmese, Khmer, Thai, Laos, Sumatran, Celebes, Javanese and Balinese scripts. From about the 5th-century, Sanskrit inscriptions become common in many parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia, with significant discoveries in Nepal, Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nSanskrit has been written in various scripts on a variety of media such as palm leaves, cloth, paper, rock and metal sheets, from ancient times.\nFor nearly 2,000 years, Sanskrit was the language of a cultural order that exerted influence across South Asia, Inner Asia, Southeast Asia, and to a certain extent East Asia. A significant form of post-Vedic Sanskrit is found in the Sanskrit of Indian epic poetry—the \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\". The deviations from in the epics are generally considered to be on account of interference from Prakrits, or innovations, and not because they are pre-Paninian. Traditional Sanskrit scholars call such deviations \"ārṣa\" (आर्ष), meaning 'of the ṛṣis', the traditional title for the ancient authors. In some contexts, there are also more \"prakritisms\" (borrowings from common speech) than in Classical Sanskrit proper. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit is a literary language heavily influenced by the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, based on early Buddhist Prakrit texts which subsequently assimilated to the Classical Sanskrit standard in varying degrees.\n\nSanskrit has greatly influenced the languages of India that grew from its vocabulary and grammatical base; for instance, Hindi is a \"Sanskritised register\" of Hindustani. All modern Indo-Aryan languages, as well as Munda and Dravidian languages have borrowed many words either directly from Sanskrit (\"tatsama\" words), or indirectly via middle Indo-Aryan languages (\"tadbhava\" words). Words originating in Sanskrit are estimated at roughly fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages, as well as the literary forms of Malayalam and Kannada. Literary texts in Telugu are lexically Sanskrit or Sanskritised to an enormous extent, perhaps seventy percent or more. Marathi is another prominent language in Western India, that derives most of its words and Marathi grammar from Sanskrit. Sanskrit words are often preferred in the literary texts in Marathi over corresponding colloquial Marathi word.\n\nBuddhist Sanskrit has had a considerable influence on East Asian languages such as Chinese, state William Wang and Chaofen Sun. Many words have been adopted from Sanskrit into the Chinese, both in its historic religious discourse and everyday use. This process likely started about 200 CE and continued through about 1400 CE, with the efforts of monks such as Yuezhi, Anxi, Kangju, Tianzhu, Yan Fodiao, Faxian, Xuanzang and Yijing. Further, as the Chinese language and culture influenced the rest of East Asia, the ideas in Sanskrit texts and some of its linguistic elements migrated further.\n\nSanskrit has also influenced Sino-Tibetan languages, mostly through translations of Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. Many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary. Chinese words like \"chànà\" (Devanagari: क्षण \"\" 'instantaneous period') were borrowed from Sanskrit. Many Sanskrit texts survive only in Tibetan collections of commentaries to the Buddhist teachings, the Tengyur.\n\nSanskrit was a language for religious purposes and for the political elite in parts of medieval era Southeast Asia, Central Asia and East Asia. In Southeast Asia, languages such as Thai and Lao contain many loanwords from Sanskrit, as do Khmer. For example, in Thai, Ravana, the emperor of Lanka, is called \"Thosakanth\", a derivation of his Sanskrit name \"Dāśakaṇṭha\" \"having ten necks\".\n\nMany Sanskrit loanwords are also found in Austronesian languages, such as Javanese, particularly the older form in which nearly half the vocabulary is borrowed. Other Austronesian languages, such as traditional Malay and modern Indonesian, also derive much of their vocabulary from Sanskrit. Similarly, Philippine languages such as Tagalog have some Sanskrit loanwords, although more are derived from Spanish. A Sanskrit loanword encountered in many Southeast Asian languages is the word \"bhāṣā\", or spoken language, which is used to refer to the names of many languages. English also has words of Sanskrit origin.\n\nSanskrit has also influenced the religious register of Japanese mostly through transliterations.These were borrowed from Chinese transliterations. In particular, the Shingon (lit. \"True Words\") sect of esoteric Buddhism has been relying on Sanskrit and original Sanskrit mantras and writings, as a means of realizing Buddhahood.\n\nSanskrit is the sacred language of various Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. It is used during worship in Hindu temples. In Newar Buddhism, it is used in all monasteries, while Mahayana and Tibetan Buddhist religious texts and sutras are in Sanskrit as well as vernacular languages. Some of the revered texts of Jainism including the Tattvartha sutra, Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra, the Bhaktamara Stotra and the Agamas are in Sanskrit. Further, states Paul Dundas, Sanskrit mantras and Sanskrit as a ritual language was commonplace among Jains throughout their medieval history.\n\nMany Hindu rituals and rites-of-passage such as the \"giving away the bride\" and mutual vows at weddings, a baby's naming or first solid food ceremony and the goodbye during a cremation invoke and chant Sanskrit hymns. Major festivals such as the \"Durga Puja\" ritually recite entire Sanskrit texts such as the \"Devi Mahatmya\" every year particularly amongst the numerous communities of eastern India. In the south, Sanskrit texts are recited at many major Hindu temples such as the Meenakshi Temple. According to Richard H. Davis, a scholar of Religion and South Asian studies, the breadth and variety of oral recitations of the Sanskrit text \"Bhagavad Gita\" is remarkable. In India and beyond, its recitations include \"simple private household readings, to family and neighborhood recitation sessions, to holy men reciting in temples or at pilgrimage places for passersby, to public Gita discourses held almost nightly at halls and auditoriums in every Indian city\".\n\nMore than 3,000 Sanskrit works have been composed since India's independence in 1947. Much of this work has been judged of high quality, in comparison to both classical Sanskrit literature and modern literature in other Indian languages.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi has given an award for the best creative work in Sanskrit every year since 1967. In 2009, Satya Vrat Shastri became the first Sanskrit author to win the Jnanpith Award, India's highest literary award.\n\nSanskrit is used extensively in the Carnatic and Hindustani branches of classical music. Kirtanas, bhajans, stotras, and shlokas of Sanskrit are popular throughout India. The samaveda uses musical notations in several of its recessions.\n\nIn Mainland China, musicians such as Sa Dingding have written pop songs in Sanskrit.\n\nNumerous loan Sanskrit words are found in other major Asian languages. For example, Filipino, Cebuano, Lao, Khmer Thai and its alphabets, Malay, Indonesian (old Javanese-English dictionary by P.J. Zoetmulder contains over 25,500 entries), and even in English.\n\nOver 90 weeklies, fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit. Sudharma, a daily newspaper in Sanskrit, has been published out of Mysore, India, since 1970, while Sanskrit Vartman Patram and Vishwasya Vrittantam started in Gujarat during the last five years. Since 1974, there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run All India Radio. These broadcasts are also made available on the internet on AIR's website. Sanskrit news is broadcast on TV and on the internet through the DD National channel at 6:55 AM IST.\n\nSanskrit is one the 15 languages of the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.\nThe Central Board of Secondary Education of India (CBSE), along with several other state education boards, has made Sanskrit an alternative option to the state's own official language as a second or third language choice in the schools it governs. In such schools, learning Sanskrit is an option for grades 5 to 8 (Classes V to VIII). This is true of most schools affiliated with the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) board, especially in states where the official language is Hindi. Sanskrit is also taught in traditional gurukulas throughout India.\n\nA number of colleges and universities in India have dedicated departments for Sanskrit studies.\n\nSt James Junior School in London, England, offers Sanskrit as part of the curriculum. In the United States, since September 2009, high school students have been able to receive credits as Independent Study or toward Foreign Language requirements by studying Sanskrit, as part of the \"SAFL: Samskritam as a Foreign Language\" program coordinated by Samskrita Bharati. In Australia, the Sydney private boys' high school Sydney Grammar School offers Sanskrit from years 7 through to 12, including for the Higher School Certificate.\n\nEuropean scholarship in Sanskrit, begun by Heinrich Roth (1620–1668) and Johann Ernst Hanxleden (1681–1731), is considered responsible for the discovery of an Indo-European language family by Sir William Jones (1746–1794). This research played an important role in the development of Western philology, or historical linguistics.\n\nThe 18th- and 19th-century speculations about the possible links of Sanskrit to ancient Egyptian language were later proven to be wrong, but it fed an orientalist discourse both in the form Indophobia and Indophilia, states Trautmann. Sanskrit writings, when first discovered, were imagined by Indophiles to potentially be \"repositories of the primitive experiences and religion of the human race, and as such confirmatory of the truth of Christian scripture\", as well as a key to \"universal ethnological narrative\". The Indophobes imagined the opposite, making the counterclaim that there is little of any value in Sanskrit, portraying it as \"a language fabricated by artful [Brahmin] priests\", with little original thought, possibly copied from the Greeks who came with Alexander or perhaps the Persians. \n\nScholars such as William Jones and his colleagues felt the need for systematic studies of Sanskrit language and literature. This launched the Asiatic Society, an idea that was soon transplanted to Europe starting with the efforts of Henry Thomas Colebrooke in Britain, then Alexander Hamilton who helped expand its studies to Paris and thereafter his student Friedrich Schlegel who introduced Sanskrit to the universities of Germany. Schlegel nurtured his own students into influential European Sanskrit scholars, particularly through Franz Bopp and Friedrich Max Muller. As these scholars translated the Sanskrit manuscripts, the enthusiasm for Sanskrit grew rapidly among European scholars, states Trautmann, and chairs for Sanskrit \"were established in the universities of nearly every German statelet\" creating a competition for Sanskrit experts.\n\nIn Nepal, India and Indonesia, Sanskrit phrases are widely used as mottoes for various national, educational and social organisations:\n\n\"Satyagraha\", an opera by Philip Glass, uses texts from the \"Bhagavad Gita\", sung in Sanskrit. The closing credits of \"The Matrix Revolutions\" has a prayer from the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\". The song \"Cyber-raga\" from Madonna's album \"Music\" includes Sanskrit chants, and \"Shanti/Ashtangi\" from her 1998 album \"Ray of Light\", which won a Grammy, is the ashtanga vinyasa yoga chant. The lyrics include the mantra Om shanti. Composer John Williams featured choirs singing in Sanskrit for \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and in \"\". The theme song of \"Battlestar Galactica 2004\" is the Gayatri Mantra, taken from the Rigveda. The lyrics of \"The Child In Us\" by Enigma also contains Sanskrit verses.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3224795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3224795", "title": "Scientific modelling", "text": "Scientific modelling\n\nScientific modelling is a scientific activity, the aim of which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to understand, define, quantify, visualize, or simulate by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted knowledge. It requires selecting and identifying relevant aspects of a situation in the real world and then using different types of models for different aims, such as conceptual models to better understand, operational models to operationalize, mathematical models to quantify, and graphical models to visualize the subject. Modelling is an essential and inseparable part of many scientific disciplines, each of which have their own ideas about specific types of modelling.\n\nThere is also an increasing attention to scientific modelling in fields such as science education, philosophy of science, systems theory, and knowledge visualization. There is growing collection of methods, techniques and meta-theory about all kinds of specialized scientific modelling.\n\nA scientific model seeks to represent empirical objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a logical and objective way. All models are \"in simulacra\", that is, simplified reflections of reality that, despite being approximations, can be extremely useful. Building and disputing models is fundamental to the scientific enterprise. Complete and true representation may be impossible, but scientific debate often concerns which is the better model for a given task, e.g., which is the more accurate climate model for seasonal forecasting.\n\nAttempts to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences use an interpretation to model reality, in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic. The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system that will not produce theoretical consequences that are contrary to what is found in reality. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.\n\nFor the scientist, a model is also a way in which the human thought processes can be amplified. For instance, models that are rendered in software allow scientists to leverage computational power to simulate, visualize, manipulate and gain intuition about the entity, phenomenon, or process being represented. Such computer models are \"in silico\". Other types of scientific models are \"in vivo\" (living models, such as laboratory rats) and \"in vitro\" (in glassware, such as tissue culture).\n\nModels are typically used when it is either impossible or impractical to create experimental conditions in which scientists can directly measure outcomes. Direct measurement of outcomes under controlled conditions (see Scientific method) will always be more reliable than modelled estimates of outcomes.\n\nWithin modelling and simulation, a model is a task-driven, purposeful simplification and abstraction of a perception of reality, shaped by physical, legal, and cognitive constraints. It is task-driven, because a model is captured with a certain question or task in mind. Simplifications leave all the known and observed entities and their relation out that are not important for the task. Abstraction aggregates information that is important, but not needed in the same detail as the object of interest. Both activities, simplification and abstraction, are done purposefully. However, they are done based on a perception of reality. This perception is already a \"model\" in itself, as it comes with a physical constraint. There are also constraints on what we are able to legally observe with our current tools and methods, and cognitive constraints which limit what we are able to explain with our current theories. This model comprises the concepts, their behavior, and their relations in formal form and is often referred to as a conceptual model. In order to execute the model, it needs to be implemented as a computer simulation. This requires more choices, such as numerical approximations or the use of heuristics. Despite all these epistemological and computational constraints, simulation has been recognized as the third pillar of scientific methods: theory building, simulation, and experimentation.\n\nA simulation is the implementation of a model. A steady state simulation provides information about the system at a specific instant in time (usually at equilibrium, if such a state exists). A dynamic simulation provides information over time. A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. Such a simulation can be useful for testing, analysis, or training in those cases where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by models.\n\nStructure is a fundamental and sometimes intangible notion covering the recognition, observation, nature, and stability of patterns and relationships of entities. From a child's verbal description of a snowflake, to the detailed scientific analysis of the properties of magnetic fields, the concept of structure is an essential foundation of nearly every mode of inquiry and discovery in science, philosophy, and art.\n\nA system is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. In general, a system is a construct or collection of different elements that together can produce results not obtainable by the elements alone. The concept of an 'integrated whole' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships which are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime. There are two types of system models: 1) discrete in which the variables change instantaneously at separate points in time and, 2) continuous where the state variables change continuously with respect to time.\n\nModelling is the process of generating a model as a conceptual representation of some phenomenon. Typically a model will deal with only some aspects of the phenomenon in question, and two models of the same phenomenon may be essentially different—that is to say, that the differences between them comprise more than just a simple renaming of components.\n\nSuch differences may be due to differing requirements of the model's end users, or to conceptual or aesthetic differences among the modellers and to contingent decisions made during the modelling process. Considerations that may influence the structure of a model might be the modeller's preference for a reduced ontology, preferences regarding statistical models versus deterministic models, discrete versus continuous time, etc. In any case, users of a model need to understand the assumptions made that are pertinent to its validity for a given use.\n\nBuilding a model requires abstraction. Assumptions are used in modelling in order to specify the domain of application of the model. For example, the special theory of relativity assumes an inertial frame of reference. This assumption was contextualized and further explained by the general theory of relativity. A model makes accurate predictions when its assumptions are valid, and might well not make accurate predictions when its assumptions do not hold. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the general theory of relativity works in non-inertial reference frames as well).\n\nThe term \"assumption\" is actually broader than its standard use, etymologically speaking. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and online Wiktionary indicate its Latin source as \"assumere\" (\"accept, to take to oneself, adopt, usurp\"), which is a conjunction of \"ad-\" (\"to, towards, at\") and \"sumere\" (to take). The root survives, with shifted meanings, in the Italian \"sumere\" and Spanish \"sumir\". In the OED, \"assume\" has the senses of (i) “investing oneself with (an attribute), ” (ii) “to undertake” (especially in Law), (iii) “to take to oneself in appearance only, to pretend to possess,” and (iv) “to suppose a thing to be.” Thus, \"assumption\" connotes other associations than the contemporary standard sense of “that which is assumed or taken for granted; a supposition, postulate,” and deserves a broader analysis in the philosophy of science.\n\nA model is evaluated first and foremost by its consistency to empirical data; any model inconsistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected. One way to modify the model is by restricting the domain over which it is credited with having high validity. A case in point is Newtonian physics, which is highly useful except for the very small, the very fast, and the very massive phenomena of the universe. However, a fit to empirical data alone is not sufficient for a model to be accepted as valid. Other factors important in evaluating a model include:\nPeople may attempt to quantify the evaluation of a model using a utility function.\n\nVisualization is any technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of man. Examples from history include cave paintings, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Greek geometry, and Leonardo da Vinci's revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes.\n\nSpace mapping refers to a methodology that employs a \"quasi-global\" modeling formulation to link companion \"coarse\" (ideal or low-fidelity) with \"fine\" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In engineering optimization, space mapping aligns (maps) a very fast coarse model with its related expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment process iteratively refines a \"mapped\" coarse model (surrogate model).\n\n\n\n\nOne application of scientific modelling is the field of modelling and simulation, generally referred to as \"M&S\". M&S has a spectrum of applications which range from concept development and analysis, through experimentation, measurement and verification, to disposal analysis. Projects and programs may use hundreds of different simulations, simulators and model analysis tools.\nThe figure shows how Modelling and Simulation is used as a central part of an integrated program in a Defence capability development process.\n\nModel–based learning in education, particularly in relation to learning science involves students creating models for scientific concepts in order to:\n\nDifferent types of model based learning techniques include:\n\nModel–making in education is an iterative exercise with students refining, developing and evaluating their models over time. This shifts learning from the rigidity and monotony of traditional curriculum to an exercise of students' creativity and curiosity. This approach utilizes the constructive strategy of social collaboration and learning scaffold theory. Model based learning includes cognitive reasoning skills where existing models can be improved upon by construction of newer models using the old models as a basis.\n\n\"Model–based learning entails determining target models and a learning pathway that provide realistic chances of understanding.\" Model making can also incorporate blended learning strategies by using web based tools and simulators, thereby allowing students to:\n\n\"A well-designed simulation simplifies a real world system while heightening awareness of the complexity of the system. Students can participate in the simplified system and learn how the real system operates without spending days, weeks or years it would take to undergo this experience in the real world.\" \n\nThe teacher's role in the overall teaching and learning process is primarily that of a facilitator and arranger of the learning experience. He or she would assign the students, a model making activity for a particular concept and provide relevant information or support for the activity. For virtual model making activities, the teacher can also provide information on the usage of the digital tool and render troubleshooting support in case of glitches while using the same. The teacher can also arrange the group discussion activity between the students and provide the platform necessary for students to share their observations and knowledge extracted from the model making activity.\n\nModel–based learning evaluation could include the use of rubrics that assess the ingenuity and creativity of the student in the model construction and also the overall classroom participation of the student vis-a-vis the knowledge constructed through the activity.\n\nIt is important, however, to give due consideration to the following for successful model–based learning to occur:\n\n\nNowadays there are some 40 magazines about scientific modelling which offer all kinds of international forums. Since the 1960s there is a strong growing number of books and magazines about specific forms of scientific modelling. There is also a lot of discussion about scientific modelling in the philosophy-of-science literature. A selection:\n\n"}

In 2016 she was awarded the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize for her first short story in the German language.\nSharon Otoo was born in Ilford, London. Her parents were both originally from Accra, Ghana, before moving to Ilford, London where Otoo was born and grew up. Otoo has two siblings. After completing her schooling, she travelled to Hanover in 1992 where she stayed for a year to work as an au pair and developed an interest in the German language.\n\nOn her return Otoo studied German and Management Studies at Royal Holloway, University of London, and graduated with a BA (Hons) in 1997. After graduating from Royal Holloway, Otoo returned to Germany where she has lived ever since, living in Berlin since 2006 with her four sons.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Guardian\" newspaper in 2016, Otoo described herself as a “Black British mother, activist, author and editor” and spoke of having mixed feelings towards Britain. “I have a British passport and London is my home,” she said, “but there was still this something in the background music that said: ‘You don’t really belong here’.”\n\nAs an activist Otoo has been involved with the Initiative for Black People in Germany (\"Initiative Schwarze Menschen in Deutschland (ISD-Bund)\"), serving on the board of directors between 2010 and 2013 as well as a number of other groups. She edits the English-language book series \"Witnessed\" and has published numerous politically engaged articles on the subjects of culture, diversity and feminism.\n\nIn her \"Guardian\" interview of 2016 she explained: “Politics can be very polarising and confrontational. With my writing, I would like to say: we can go out and demonstrate, but at the end of the day all we all want is to be understood and be treated with empathy.”\n\nSince 2014 she has worked as a project coordinator for the \"Regionale Arbeitsstelle Berlin\", an organisation which furthers the social integration and development of children of immigrant families from their early schooling up to professional training.\n\nOtoo’s first novella was entitled \"the things i am thinking while smiling politely\" [sic], published in February 2012 by Edition Assemblage, a small left-wing German publisher. This was followed in 2014 by another novella \"Synchronicity\". Both works were originally written in English and translated into German by Mirjam Nuenning.\n\nOtoo’s creative writing encompasses magical realism, Afrofuturism, identity issues, relationships and empowerment. She cites German-language writers such as Bertolt Brecht and Max Frisch as inspiration, for “combining sharp analysis of society with humour”, as well as Toni Morrison and Mildred D Taylor, “women writers who made the black experience in the US very tangible to me”.\n\nOtoo was invited to take part in the 2016 Ingeborg Bachmann Prize competition by \"Frankfurter Allgemeine\" editor Sandra Kegel. At the time Otoo said she was not aware of the prize’s significance in the German-speaking world. “That was probably a good idea,” she said , “otherwise I wouldn’t have submitted anything.”\n\nOtoo’s winning entry was “Herr Gröttrup setzte sich hin” (“Herr Gröttrup sat down”), the story of engineer and V2 rocket-scientist Helmut Gröttrup and his wife Irmgard sitting down to breakfast. Herr Gröttrup’s breakfast egg takes over the narration and rebels against the orderly household by remaining soft despite being boiled for the regulation seven and a half minutes: and so commences a story hailed for its ‘changeling’ character, gentle satire and humour.\n\nThe award was presented by the Mayor of Klagenfurt, Maria Luise Mathiasschitz, who praised Otoo as “a new voice for a new society”. When questioned by \"The Guardian\" whether the award represented the jury’s desire to make a stand against the growing xenophobia and right-wing populism in Europe, Otoo said it might have played a part, “but I think in the end they voted for the quality of the story”.\n\nThe award has a prize of 25,000 Euros and Otoo has said that she intends to use the opportunity to write her first full-length novel.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor's website: https://about.me/sharonotoo\n\nAt the Edition Assemblage website: http://www.edition-assemblage.de/sharon-dodua-otoo/\n\nAt the ORF website: http://bachmannpreis.orf.at/stories/2783570/\n"}
{"id": "3548370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3548370", "title": "Shiksha", "text": "Shiksha\n\nShiksha ( IAST: ) is a Sanskrit word, which means \"instruction, lesson, learning, study of skill\". It also refers to one of the six Vedangas, or limbs of Vedic studies, on phonetics and phonology in Sanskrit.\n\n\"Shiksha\" is the field of Vedic study of sound, focussing on the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, accent, quantity, stress, melody and rules of euphonic combination of words during a Vedic recitation. Each ancient Vedic school developed this field of \"Vedanga\", and the oldest surviving phonetic textbooks are the \"Pratishakyas\". The \"Paniniya-Siksa\" and \"Naradiya-Siksa\" are examples of extant ancient manuscripts of this field of Vedic studies.\n\n\"Shiksha\" is the oldest and the first auxiliary discipline to the Vedas, maintained since the Vedic era. It aims at construction of sound and language for synthesis of ideas, in contrast to grammarians who developed rules for language deconstruction and understanding of ideas. This field helped preserve the Vedas and the Upanishads as the canons of Hinduism since the ancient times, and shared by various Hindu traditions.\n\nShiksha literally means \"instruction, lesson, study, knowledge, learning, study of skill, training in an art\". It also refers to one of the six Vedangas, which studies sound, Sanskrit phonetics, laws of euphonic combination (\"sandhi\"), and the science of making language pleasant and understood without mistakes. \"Shiksha\" as a supplemental branch of the Vedas, included teaching proper articulation and pronunciation of Vedic texts. It was one of six fields of supplemental studies, others being grammar (Vyakarana), prosody (Chandas), ritual (Kalpa), etymology (Nirukta) and astrology (Jyotisha, calculating favorable time for rituals).\n\nThe roots of \"Shiksha\" can be traced to the Rigveda which dedicates two hymns 10.125 and 10.71 to revere sound as a goddess, and links the development of thought to the development of speech. The mid 1st-millennium BCE text Taittiriya Upanishad contains one of the earliest description of \"Shiksha\" as follows,\n\nAnnette Wilke and Oliver Moebus date the Shiksha text of the Taittiriya Vedic school to be from 600 BCE at the latest. Texts such as this established, among other things, a rational order of the Sanskrit alphabet, state Wilke and Moebus. Other texts, such as \"Vyasa-Siksa\" of the Krishna Yajurveda, were composed later.\n\nThe ancient Vedic schools developed major treatises analyzing sound, vowels and consonants, rules of combination and pronunciation to assist clear understanding, to avoid mistakes and for resonance (pleasing to the listener). These texts include \"Samhita-pathas\" and \"Pada-pathas\", and partially or fully surviving manuscripts include \"Paniniya Shiksha\", \"Naradiya Shiksha\", \"Bharadvaja Shiksha\", \"Yajnavalkya Shiksha\", \"Vasishthi Shiksha\", \"Parashari Shiksha\", \"Katyayani Shiksha\" and \"Manduki Shiksha\".\n\n\"Shiksha\", states Hartmut Scharfe, was the first branch of linguistics to develop as an independent Vedic field of study among the Vedangas. This is likely because Vedas were transmitted from one generation to the next by oral tradition, and the preservation and the techniques of preservation depended on phonetics, states Scharfe.\n\nThe earliest Brahmanas – a layer of text within the Vedas, include some terms of art in the Vedic phonetics, such as \"Varna\" and \"Avasana\". The \"Shiksha\" field was likely well developed by the time Aranyakas and Upanishads layer of the Vedas were being composed. The alphabet had been categorized by this time, into vowels (\"svara\"), stops (\"sparsa\"), semivowels (\"antastha\") and spirants (\"usman\"). The field was fundamental to the ancient study of linguistics, and it developed as an interest and inquiry into sounds rather than letters. \"Shiksha\", as described in these ancient texts, had six chapters - \"varna\" (sound), \"svara\" (accent), \"matra\" (quantity), \"bala\" (strength, articulation), \"saman\"(recital) and \"samtana\" (connection between preceding and following sounds).\n\nThe insights from this field, states Scharfe, \"without doubt was applied by Vedic scholars to the art of writing\". It also impacted the development of Indic scripts and evolution of language in countries that sought Indian texts or were influenced by Indian religions. According to Scharfe, and other scholars, the insights developed in this field, over time, likely also influenced phonetic scripts in parts of East Asia, as well as Arabic grammarian Halil in 8th-century CE.\n\nThe \"Shiksha\" field of Vedic studies arranged the Sanskrit alphabet in a rational order, state Wilke and Moebus, each mapped to the anatomical nature of human sounds, from the back to the front - throat (at the very back), palate, palatal ridge, teeth and lips. The letters of the Sanskrit alphabet were further organized by the Vedic scholars into a magic square, making symmetrical and resonant alternate readings of the letters possible, such as top to bottom in addition to left to right. Further, the \"Shiksha\" scholars added \"Mudra\" (hand signs) to go with each sound, thereby providing a visual confirmation and an alternate means to check the reading integrity by the audience, in addition to the audible means.\n\nThese Mudras continue to be part of the classical Indian dance tradition. This interplay of the gesture and sound in Sanskrit recital, state Wilke and Moebus, is similar to the gesture of a conductor and the sound produced by music players in any classical orchestra. In Sanskrit, the posture of the performer is an added dimension to those of pronunciation and gesture, together these empowered muscular memory with acoustic memory in the Hindu tradition of remembering and transmitting Sanskrit texts from one generation to the next, state Wilke and Moebus.\n\nThe methodical phonetic procedure developed by \"Shiksha\" helped preserve the Vedas without the slightest variants in the most faithful way possible. It made the Vedas and embedded Principal Upanishads the canonical scriptures of Hinduism. The rules and symmetric of Siksa helped the student to master enormous volumes of knowledge, and use the embedded codes and rules to self check his memory.\n\nHowever, state Wilke and Moebus, the Shiksha methodology has been not just highly technical, it has strong aesthetic \"sensuous, emotive\" dimension, which foster thinking and intellectual skills in a participatory fashion. The reciter's mind and body are engaged, making language and sound as an emotional performance. The study of phonetics functioned to transform a Vedic text, which traditionally was composed as language-music, into a musical performance. Individual sounds in the Sanskrit have independent personalities, and the reciter helps develop their character and their timbre, state Wilke and Moebus. Naradiya Siksa, a phonetics treatise on the Sama Veda explains this aspects of phonology with various similes, such as,\n\nPratisakhyas are the oldest \"Siksa\" textbooks of each branch of the Vedas. Later Siksa texts are more specialized and systematic, and often titled with suffix \"Siksa\", such as the Naradiya-Siksa, Vyasa-Siksa, Pari-Siksa and Sarvasammata-Siksa.\n\nThe Pratishakhyas, which evolved from the more ancient Vedic Texts padapathas (\") around 800 BCE, deal with the manner in which the Vedas are to be enunciated. There are separate Pratishakhyas for each Veda. They complement the books called Shiksha written by various authorities. Several Pratishakhyas have survived into the modern era, and these texts refine the structure of sound at different levels of nuance, some adding many more letters to the basic set in the Sanskrit alphabet:\n\nThe Shiksha Texts and the Pratishakhyas led to great clarity in understanding the surface structure of language. For clarity of pronunciation, they broke up the large Vedic compounds into word stems, prefixes, and suffixes. Certain styles of recitation (\"), such as the \",\" involved switching syllables, repeating the last word of a line at the beginning of the next, and other permutations. In the process, a considerable amount of morphology is discussed, particularly regarding the combination of sequential sounds, which leads to the modalities of sandhi. The Samaveda Pratishakhya, one of the earliest, organizes the stop consonant sounds into a 5x5 \"varga\" or square:\n\nThe alphabet is designed such that the difference between sounds is preserved whether you recite it horizontally or vertically. It was extended and completed with fricatives and sibilants, semi-vowels, and vowels, and was eventually codified into the Brahmi alphabet, which is one of the most systematic sound-to-writing mappings. Scholar Frits Staal has commented, \"Like Mendelejev’s Periodic System of Elements, the varga system was the result of centuries of analysis. In the course of that development the basic concepts of phonology were discovered and defined.\n\nThe Varga system and the Pratishakshyas, contributions of the Shiksha texts, are elaborate systems which deal with the generation and classification of sound.\n\nIn addition, several Shiksha texts exist, most of them in metrical verse form but a few in sutra form. The following list contains some of these surviving texts (English translation of Paniniya Siksa.pdf): Amoghanandini Shiksha, Apisali Shiksha (in sutra form), Aranya Shiksha, Atreya Shiksha, Avasananirnyaya Shiksha, Bharadvaja Shiksha, Chandra Shiksha of Chandragomin (sutra form), Charayaniya Shiksha, Galadrka Shiksha, Kalanirnya Shiksha, Katyayani Shiksha, Kaundinya Shiksha, Keshavi Shiksha, Kramakarika Shiksha, Kramasandhaana Shiksha, Laghumoghanandini Shiksha, Lakshmikanta Shiksha, Lomashi Shiksha, Madhyandina Shiksha, Mandavya Shiksha, Mallasharmakrta Shiksha, Manasvaara Shiksha, Manduki Shiksha, Naradiya Shiksha, Paniniya Shiksha (versified), Paniniya Shiksha (in sutra form), Paniniya Shiksha (with accents), Parashari Shiksha, Padyaatmika Keshavi Shiksha, Pari Shiksha, Pratishakhyapradipa Shiksha, Sarvasammata Shiksha, Shaishiriya Shiksha, Shamaana Shiksha, Shambhu Shiksha, Shodashashloki Shiksha, Shikshasamgraha, Siddhanta Shiksha, Svaraankusha Shiksha, Svarashtaka Shiksha, Svaravyanjana Shiksha, Vasishtha Shiksha, Varnaratnapradipa Shiksha, Vyaali Shiksha, Vyasa Shiksha, Yajnavalkya Shiksha\n\nAlthough many of these Shiksha texts are attached to specific Vedic schools, others are late texts.\n\nTraditionally syllables (not letters) in Sanskrit are called \"Akshara\", meaning \"imperishable (entity)\": \"atoms\" of speech, as it were. These aksharas are classified mainly into two types:\n\n\"Svara aksharas\" are also known as \"prana akshara\"; i.e., they are main sounds in speech, without which speech is not possible. Pāṇini referred to \"svara\" as \"ac pratyahara\". Later they became known as \"ac Akshara\".\n\n\"Vyanjana\" means embellishment, i.e., consonants are used as embellishment in order to yield sonorant vowels. They are also known as \"Prani akshara\"; that is, they are like a body to which life (\"svara\") is added. Pāṇini's name for \"vyanjana\" was \"Hal Pratyahara\", which were later referred to as \"Hal akshara\".\n\n\"Vyanjana aksharas\" are divided into three types:\nSparsa aksharas include syllables from \"ka\" to \"ma\"; they are 25 in number. Antastha aksharas include syllables \"ya\", \"ra\", \"la\" and \"va\". Usman aksharas include \"śa\", \"ṣa\", \"sa\" and \"ha\".\n\nEach vowel can be classified into three types based on the duration of pronunciation (\"morae\"):\nWe see that each vowel can be pronounced in three ways according to the duration of articulation.\nThe unit of time is a \"mātra\" (approx. 0.4 seconds).\n\nEach vowel can be further classified into two types based on the manner of pronunciation:\n\nEach vowel can also be classified into three types, that is, pronounced in three ways, based on accent of articulation. This feature was lost in Classical Sanskrit, but used in reciting Vedic and Upanishadic hymns and mantras.\n\nGenerally, in articulatory phonetics, the place of articulation (or \"point of articulation\") of a consonant is the point of contact, where an obstruction occurs in the vocal tract between an active (moving) articulator (typically some part of the tongue) and a passive (stationary) articulator (typically some part of the roof of the mouth).\n\nBut according to Indian linguistic tradition, there are five \"passive\" places of articulation:\n\nApart from that, other articulations are combinations of the above five places:\n\nThere are three \"active\" places of articulation:\n\nEffort (or manner) of articulation () is of two types for consonants,\n\nArticulation of consonants will be a logical combination of components in the two prayatnas. The below table gives a view upon articulation of consonants.\n\n\n\n"}

It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil.\nSome of the first Singspiele were miracle plays in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word \"Singspiel\" is found in print, and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations.\n\nIn the 18th century, some Singspiele were translations of English ballad operas. In 1736, the Prussian ambassador to England commissioned a translation of the ballad opera \"The Devil to Pay\". This was successfully performed in the 1740s in Hamburg and Leipzig. A further version of this was made by Johann Adam Hiller and C. F. Weiße in 1766 (\"Der Teufel ist los oder Die verwandelten Weiber\"), the first of a string of such collaborations which led to Hiller and Weisse being called \"the fathers of the German Singspiel.\"\n\nFrench operas with spoken dialogue (\"opéras comiques\") were frequently transcribed into the German and became very successful in Vienna in the late 1770s and early 1780s. By contrast, German translations of contemporary Italian \"opere buffe\", which were quite successful in England and France at the time, were significantly less frequent. Singspiele were considered middle-to-lower class entertainment – as opposed to the predominantly aristocratic genres of opera, ballet and stage play – and were usually performed by traveling s (such as the Koch, Döbbelin and Koberwein companies), rather than by established companies within metropolitan centers.\n\nMozart wrote several Singspiele: \"Bastien und Bastienne\" (1768), \"Zaide\" (1780), \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (1782), \"Der Schauspieldirektor\" (1786), and finally \"Die Zauberflöte\" (1791). E. T. A. Hoffmann, who admired him, composed Singspiele, such as \"Liebe und Eifersucht\" in 1807.\n\nIn 1927, Kurt Weill created a new word, \"Songspiel\", to describe his work \"Mahagonny-Songspiel\".\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

Tactical urbanism is also commonly referred to as guerilla urbanism, pop-up urbanism, city repair, or D.I.Y. urbanism.\n\nThe Street Plans Collaborative defines \"tactical urbanism\" as an approach to urban change that features the following five characteristics: \n\nThe term was coined circa 2010 to describe a range of existing techniques. It is attributed to New York-based urban planner Mike Lydon. The tactical urbanist movement takes inspiration from urban experiments including Ciclovía, Paris-Plages, and the introduction of plazas and pedestrian malls in New York city during the tenure of Janette Sadik-Khan as Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation.\n\nTactical urbanism formally emerged as a movement following a meeting of the Next Generation of New Urbanist (CNU NextGen) group in November 2010 in New Orleans. A driving force of the movement is to put the onus back on individuals to take personal responsibility in creating sustainable buildings, streets, neighborhoods, and cities. Following the meeting, an open source project called Tactical Urbanism: Short TermAction | Long Term Change was developed by a group from NextGen to define Tactical Urbanism and to promote various interventions to improve urban design and promote positive change in neighbourhoods and communities.\n\nIn 1984, the English translation of The Practice of Everyday Life by Frenchman Michel de Certeau did not use the term \"tactical urbanism\" to describe events that occurred in 1968 in Paris. Certeau described tactical urbanism in opposition to \"strategic urbanism\", although the modern usage tends not to make this distinction.\n\nThe Project for Public Spaces uses the phrase \"Lighter, Quicker, Cheaper,\" coined by urban designer Eric Reynolds, to describe the same basic approach expressed by tactical urbanism.\n\nTactical urbanism projects vary significantly in scope, size, budget, and support. Projects often begin as grassroots interventions and spread to other cities and are in some cases adopted by municipal governments as best practices. A list of common interventions are listed below.\n\nTemporarily transforming retail streets using cheap or donated materials and volunteers. Spaces are transformed by introducing food carts, sidewalk tables, temporary bike lanes and narrowing of streets.\n\nThe act of removing salvageable materials and using it to build public seating. The chairs are placed in areas that either are quiet or lack comfortable places to sit.\n\nThe act of removing unnecessary fences to break down barriers between neighbours, beautify communities, and encourage community building.\n\nThe act of removing unnecessary pavement to transform driveways and parking into green space so that rainwater can be absorbed and neighbourhoods beautified.\n\nFood carts and trucks are used to attract people to underused public spaces and offer small business opportunities for entrepreneurs.\n\nGuerrilla gardening is the act of gardening on land that the gardeners do not have the legal rights to utilize, such as abandoned sites, areas not being cared for, or private property.\n\nTo temporarily provide safe spaces for walking, bicycling, skating, and social activities; promote local economic development; and raise awareness about the impact of cars in urban spaces. 'Open Streets' is an anglicized term for the South American 'Ciclovia', which originated in Bogota.\n\nAn annual event where on street parking is converted into park-like spaces. Park(ing) Day was launched in 2005 by Rebar art and design studio.\n\nPopularized in New York City, pavement plazas involve converting space on streets to usable public space. The closure of Times Square to vehicular traffic and its low-cost conversion to a pedestrian plaza is a primary example of a pavement plaza.\n\nPop-up cafes are temporary patios or terraces built in parking spots to provide overflow seating for a nearby cafe or for passersby. Most common in cities where sidewalks are narrow and where there otherwise is not room for outdoor sitting or eating areas.\n\nPop Up Parks temporarily or permanently transform underused spaces into community gathering areas through beautification.\n\nPop-up shops are temporary retail stores that are set up in vacant stores or property.\n\nThe Street Plans Collaborative, in collaboration with Ciudad Emergente and Codesign studio, produces a series of free tactical urbanism e-books. Volumes 1 and 2 focus on North American case studies, Volume 3 is a Spanish-language guide to Latin American projects, and Volume 4 covers Australia and New Zealand, including responses to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\n\nStreet Plans' Mike Lydon and Anthony Garcia published a tactical urbanism book in March 2015.\n"}

He worked to develop his mother tongue and promote Buddhism in the face of repression by the Rana rulers.\n\nKansakar was the guru and inspiration of Chittadhar Hridaya, one of the greatest literary figures of 20th-century Nepal.\n\nKansakar was born at Kel Tol, Kwachhen Nani, Kathmandu. His father was Chaityabir Singh and his mother was Laxmi Nani. The family owned a cloth shop. As a young man in 1905, Kansakar got involved in the social reformist activities of an organization known as Arya Samaj. He was fined and jailed by the Ranas for promoting an unorthodox religion. Out of prison, a dejected Kansakar went to Kolkata, India where he was inspired by the activity in Bengali language publication and love of literature among Bengalis.\n\nReturning to Kathmandu, Kansakar took to writing poetry, and his cloth shop was turned into a gathering place for poets. Each week, they would bring a copybook filled with their compositions and discuss each other's works. When the Bada Guruju (chief royal priest) came to know about it, he had all the copybooks confiscated.\n\nInspired by Tulsi Meher's homespun movement, Kansakar campaigned to popularize homespun and encouraged people to install handlooms in their homes. In 1927, he established a company named Vastrakala Bhavan to produce textiles. Kansakar was an advocate of female education, and he sent his daughter Vidyabati Kansakar to India among the first batch of students to receive nurse training.\n\nIn 1929, Kansakar headed a committee which petitioned the prime minister to be allowed to open a library. Kansakar and the rest of the signers of the appeal were arrested and fined. In 1934, all the Newar authors were summoned before the prime minister and warned to stop writing in Nepal Bhasa.\n\nKansakar also worked to promote Theravada Buddhism which aroused the anger of the government. In 1931, he was fined and jailed with 11 other people including Buddhist teacher Dhammalok Mahasthavir, poet Chittadhar Hridaya and trader Dharma Man Tuladhar for trying to spread an \"unorthodox religion\". He was also harassed and flogged for his activities.\n\nHis wife Shobha Laxmi died in 1937, and he married Buddha Maya. In 1940, the government mounted a clampdown against political workers, writers and anybody it saw as a threat to the state. Kansakar was arrested and held for 85 days.\n\nAn anthology of Kansakar's poems entitled \"Yog-Sudha\" was published by Nepal Bhasa Parisad in 1951.\n\nA street in central Kathmandu was named Yogbir Singh Marg in his honor by Kathmandu Metropolitan City.\n"}
