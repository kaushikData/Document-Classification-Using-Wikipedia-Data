Various definitions of alay are offered when one types it on a search engine. One theory that is widely accepted is that \"Alay\" is a portmanteau of the term \" (Indonesian: Kiteflyer), a pejorative describing someone having certain physical attributes from spending most of their time outside and getting sunburnt (e.g. reddened hair and skin). Also kite is considered as cheap entertainment to the middle and lower class in modern Indonesia, stereotyping alay as a part of that class. Alay is also consider as people who have these traits; Throwing garbage not in the trash can and also love to creates commotion.\n\n\" (Indonesian: Tulisan alay) is a form of the Indonesian language that has undergone \"excessive leet transformation\". Contrary to the popular belief that it is \"destroying\" the national language, grammatical standards are met in contrast to the modern Indonesian slang language. Similar to the jejebets, alay texts offer an alternative in compressing words so that they are under the 160 character-limit in text messages, often to the point that they are impossible to read. Rules in capitalization are mostly ignored.\n\nAlay text may have originated from the method of making strong passwords for internet accounts, which requires combinations of small and capital letters, numbers, as well as special characters. Normally, to keep the password meaningful and easy to remember, the password would consist of normal words, where some letters are capitalized or substituted with numbers (e.g. the letter a with 4, the letter o with 0). Soon this becomes a habit in writing text in general, and improved with mixing English and Indonesian in one sentence.\n\nConfusing text that could not be understood properly and probably has no meaning (except for the writer), is also considered as Alay Text. This type of text usually contains information of the writer's mood and feeling, it is also common for the text to contain the writer's own philosophy on a certain topic such as : love, heart break, and relationship. \nAccording to \"The Jakarta Post\", a high school student from East Java initiated the trend and shot to fame after her writings were discussed in forums and blogs not because they were great, but they were in \"code\". Her approach in writing attracted a lot of attention, with some people reproducing her writing in forums and blogs.\n\n"}

He was one of a handful of Goan Hindus to have used Portuguese as his literary language, though he wrote also in Marathi. He was perhaps the only dedicated fictionist in Portuguese to have operated in Goa throughout the Estado Novo. 'His idiosyncratic language, raw provocative themes, and the great ambiguity with which he treats his subjects, make Sar Dessai one of the more interesting Goan writers to have worked in Portuguese'.\n\nHe was born in 1910 and practised medicine in the town of Mardol, Goa. He drew on his experience as a clinician for many of his plays and short narratives, such as \"Um Cavalheiro Amável\" [A Pleasant Gentleman] and \"Vaxina, dá-me um pouco de Vaxina também\" [Vacshin, give me some vacshin too].\n\nSau Dessai penned over 30 radio plays, some of which were broadcast, for example via the former \"Emissora de Goa\". Others were published in the now-defunct Portuguese-language press of Goa, in papers such as \"O Heraldo\" and \"A Luta\". He also wrote in Marathi, but little work has been done to establish his corpus in this language.\n\nSar Dessai's short stories are often about poverty and the lack of social justice. Indeed, in some of his stories, Sar Dessai is the closest Goa had in the Portuguese-language to an explicitly anti-colonial literary stance towards Salazar's Estado Novo. Rare for a writer of his time, several of his narratives take place in the hinterland of Goa known as the Novas Conquistas, where Hindus have always formed the majority of the population and where the effects of Portuguese colonialism were rather different than in the coastal strip of Goa.\n\nAn anthology of Sar Dessai's short stories and radio plays was prepared by the Portuguese critic Manuel de Seabra in the mid 1970s. It was submitted to the Agência Geral do Ultramar, the Portuguese government agency dedicated to publishing work from the Portuguese overseas territories, but never commissioned and the manuscript never returned. The likelihood is that the manuscript was discarded when the dictatorship fell. Unless a copy of these texts has been retained in Goa - Seabra did not keep a copy for his personal records - it seems that at least half the author's oeuvre has unfortunately been lost.\n\nSar Dessai's few poems in Portuguese were written after 1961 and mostly concern Indian nationalist themes.\n\n"}

In 1933 while searching for a suitable consultant in the Hanis Coos language from among the eight or ten elderly Coos Indians who were still fluent at that time, Jacobs discovered that Peterson was fluent not only in Hanis, but also in Miluk Coos, a Penutian language thought to have been extinct for at least fifteen years. Through the summers of 1933 and 1934, Jacobs interviewed Peterson in those two languages, collecting 32 Coos myth texts in Miluk, eight in Hanis, and two in both Hanis and Miluk for comparison of the two languages. Wax-cylinder phonograph recordings were also taken of the myths and songs during both years. In addition, Jacobs collected from Peterson a large number of narrative and ethnologic texts in Miluk, a smaller number in Hanis, and eight texts in both Hanis and Miluk. The narrative and ethnologic texts were published in 1939; the myth texts in 1940.\n\nAnnie was born in 1860 of a Coos Indian mother and a white father, James Miner, whom she never met, at the native village of Willanch (Wu'læ'ænch, meaning good-weather-place) at the present-day Cooston, on the east shore of upper Coos Bay on the southern Oregon Coast. She was one of the last Coos Indians to grow up in the traditional Coos culture. As an infant she was taken by her mother to the Coastal Indian Reservation at Yaquina Bay, and later removed to the sub-agency at Yachats where she grew up and married, first to an abusive older Hanis man, and later to William Jackson, an Alsea Indian her own age. Through their daughter, Nellie (Aason), there are descendants to the present day. Annie married three more times, unhappily, but her last marriage was a happy and compatible relationship with a Swedish logger named Carl Peterson. They both died of tuberculosis in 1939 at their home on lower Coos Bay.\n\nAnnie Miner Peterson was an accomplished basketmaker, storyteller, and repository of indigenous Coos languages and traditional culture.

{"id": "3541992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3541992", "title": "Arawakan languages", "text": "Arawakan languages\n\nArawakan (\"Arahuacan, Maipuran Arawakan, \"mainstream\" Arawakan, Arawakan proper\"), also known as Maipurean (also \"Maipuran, Maipureano, Maipúre\"), is a language family that developed among ancient indigenous peoples in South America. Branches migrated to Central America and the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean and the Atlantic, including what is now the Bahamas. Only present-day Ecuador, Uruguay, and Chile did not have peoples who spoke Arawakan languages. Maipurean may be related to other language families in a hypothetical Macro-Arawakan stock.\n\nThe name \"Maipure\" was given to the family by Filippo S. Gilij in 1782, after the Maipure language of Venezuela, which he used as a basis of his comparisons. It was renamed after the culturally more important Arawak language a century later. The term \"Arawak\" took over, until its use was extended by North American scholars to the broader Macro-Arawakan proposal. At that time, the name \"Maipurean\" was resurrected for the core family. See Arawakan \"vs\" Maipurean for details.\n\nClassification of Maipurean is difficult because of the large number of Arawakan languages that are extinct and poorly documented. However, apart from transparent relationships that might constitute single languages, several groups of Maipurean languages are generally accepted by scholars. Many classifications agree in dividing Maipurean into northern and southern branches, but perhaps not all languages fit into one or the other. The three classifications below are accepted by all:\n\nAn early contrast between \"Ta-Arawak\" and \"Nu-Arawak\", depending on the prefix for \"I\", is spurious; \"nu-\" is the ancestral form for the entire family, and \"ta-\" is an innovation of one branch of the family.\n\nThe following (tentative) classification is from Kaufman (1994: 57-60). Details of established branches are given in the linked articles. In addition to the family tree detailed below, there are a few languages that are \"Non-Maipurean Arawakan languages or too scantily known to classify\" (Kaufman 1994: 58), which include these:\n\n\nAnother language is also mentioned as \"Arawakan\":\n\nIncluding the unclassified languages mentioned above, the Maipurean family has about 64 languages. Out of them, 29 languages are now extinct: Wainumá, Mariaté, Anauyá, Amarizana, Jumana, Pasé, Cawishana, Garú, Marawá, Guinao, Yavitero, Maipure, Manao, Kariaí, Waraikú, Yabaána, Wiriná, Aruán, Taíno, Kalhíphona, Marawán-Karipurá, Saraveca, Custenau, Inapari, Kanamaré, Shebaye, Lapachu, and Morique.\n\n\nKaufman does not report extinct Magiana of the Moxos group.\n\nApart from minor decisions on whether a variety is a language or a dialect, changing names, and not addressing several poorly attested languages, Aikhenvald departs from Kaufman in breaking up the \"Southern Outlier\" and \"Western\" branches of Southern Maipurean. She assigns Salumã and Lapachu ('Apolista') to what is left of Southern Outlier ('South Arawak'); breaks up the \"Maritime\" branch of Northern Maipurean, though keeping Aruán and Palikur together; and is agnostic about the sub-grouping of the \"North Amazonian\" branch of Northern Maipurean.\n\nThe following breakdown uses Aikhenvald's nomenclature followed by Kaufman's: \n\nAikhenvald classifies Kaufman's unclassified languages apart from Morique. She does not classify 15 extinct languages which Kaufman had placed in various branches of Maipurean.\n\nAikhenvald (1999:69) classifies Mawayana with Wapishana together under a Rio Branco branch, giving for Mawayana also the names \"Mapidian\" and \"Mawakwa\" (with some reservations for the latter).\n\nWalker & Ribeiro (2011), using Bayesian computational phylogenetics, classify the Arawakan languages as follows.\n\nThe internal structures of each branch is given below. Note that the strictly binary splits are a result of the Bayesian computational methods used.\n\n\nIn 1783, the Italian priest Filippo Salvatore Gilii recognized the unity of the Maipure language of the Orinoco and Moxos of Bolivia; he named their family \"Maipure\". It was renamed \"Arawak\" by Von den Steinen (1886) and Brinten (1891) after Arawak in the Guianas, one of the major languages of the family. The modern equivalents are \"Maipurean\" or \"Maipuran\" and \"Arawak\" or \"Arawakan\".\n\nThe term \"Arawakan\" is now used in two senses. South American scholars use \"Aruák\" for the family demonstrated by Gilij and subsequent linguists. In North America, however, scholars have used the term to include a hypothesis adding the Guajiboan and Arawan families. In North America, scholars use the name \"Maipurean\" to distinguish the core family, which is sometimes called \"core Arawak(an)\" or \"Arawak(an) proper\" instead.\n\nKaufman (1990: 40) relates the following:\n[The Arawakan] name is the one normally applied to what is here called Maipurean. Maipurean used to be thought to be a major subgroup of Arawakan, but all the \"living\" Arawakan languages, at least, seem to need to be subgrouped with languages already found within Maipurean as commonly defined. The sorting out of the labels Maipurean and Arawakan will have to await a more sophisticated classification of the languages in question than is possible at the present state of comparative studies.\n\nThe languages called Arawakan or Maipurean were originally recognized as a separate group in the late nineteenth century. Almost all the languages now called Arawakan share a first-person singular prefix \"nu-\", but Arawak proper has \"ta-\". Other commonalities include a second-person singular \"pi-\", relative \"ka-\", and negative \"ma-\".\n\nThe Arawak language family, as constituted by L. Adam, at first by the name of Maypure, has been called by Von den Steinen \"Nu-Arawak\" from the prenominal prefix \"nu-\" for the first person. This is common to all the Arawak tribes scattered along the coasts from Dutch Guiana to British Guiana.\n\nUpper Paraguay has Arawakan-language tribes: the \"Quinquinaos\", the \"Layanas\", etc. (This is the \"Moho-Mbaure\" group of L. Quevedo). In the islands of Marajos, in the middle of the estuary of the Amazon, the \"Aruan\" people spoke an Arawak dialect. The peninsula of Goajira (north of Venezuela) is occupied by the Goajires tribe, also Arawakan speakers. In 1890–95, De Brette estimated a population of 3,000 persons in the Goajires.\n\nC. H. de Goeje's published vocabulary of 1928 outlines the Lokono/Arawak (Dutch and Guiana) 1400 items, mostly morphemes (stems, affixes) and morpheme partials (single sounds) – rarely compounded, derived, or otherwise complex sequences; and from Nancy P. Hickerson's \"British Guiana\" manuscript vocabulary of 500 items. However, most entries which reflect acculturation are direct borrowings from one or another of three model languages (Spanish, Dutch, English). Of the 1400 entries in de Goeje, 106 reflect European contact; 98 of these are loans. Nouns which occur with the verbalizing suffix described above number 9 out of the 98 loans.\n\nThough a great deal of variation can be found from language to language, the following is a general composite statement of the consonants and vowels typically found in Arawak languages, according to Aikhenvald (1999):\n\nFor more detailed notes on specific languages see Aikhenvald (1999) pp. 76–77.\n\nArawakan languages are polysynthetic and mostly head-marking. They have fairly complex verb morphology. Noun morphology is much less complex and tends to be similar across the family. Arawakan languages are mostly suffixing, with just a few prefixes.\n\nArawakan languages tend to distinguish alienable and inalienable possession. A feature found throughout the Arawakan family is a suffix (whose reconstructed Proto-Arawakan form is /*-tsi/) that allows the inalienable (and obligatorily possessed) body-part nouns to remain unpossessed. This suffix essentially converts inalienable body-part nouns into alienable nouns. It can only be added to body-part nouns and not to kinship nouns (which are also treated as inalienable). An example from the Pareci language is given below:\n\nMany Arawakan languages have a system of classifier morphemes that mark the semantic category of the head noun of a noun phrase on most other elements of the noun phrase. The example below is from the Tariana language, in which classifier suffixes mark the semantic category of the head noun on all elements of a noun phrase other than the head noun (including adjectives, numerals, demonstratives, possessives) and on the verb of the clause:\n\nMost Arawakan languages have split-intransitive alignment systems of subject and object cross-referencing on the verb. The agentive arguments of both transitive and intransitive verbs are marked with prefixes, whereas the patientive arguments of both transitive and intransitive verbs are marked with suffixes. The following example from Baniwa of Içana shows a typical Arawakan split-intransitive alignment:\n\nThe prefixes and suffixes used for subject and object cross-referencing on the verb are stable throughout the Arawakan languages, and can therefore be reconstructed for Proto-Arawakan. The table below shows the likely forms of Proto-Arawakan:\n\nThe Arawak word for maize is \"marisi,\" and various forms of this word are found among the related tribal languages:\n\nArawak is the largest family in the Americas with the respect to number of languages. The Arawakan languages are spoken by peoples occupying a large swath of territory, from the eastern slopes of the central Andes Mountains in Peru and Bolivia, across the Amazon basin of Brazil, northward into Suriname, Guyana, French Guyana, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago and Colombia on the northern coast of South America, and as far north as Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize and Guatemala. The languages used to be found in Argentina and Paraguay as well.\n\nArawak-speaking peoples migrated to islands in the Caribbean, settling the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. It is possible that some poorly attested extinct languages in North America, such as the Cusabo and Congaree in South Carolina, were members of this family.\n\nTaíno, commonly called Island Arawak, was spoken on the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. A few Taino words are still used by English or Spanish-speaking descendants in these islands. The Taíno language was scantily attested but its classification within the Arawakan family is uncontroversial. Its closest relative among the better attested Arawakan languages seems to be the Goajiro language, spoken in Colombia. Scholars have suggested that the Goajiro are descended from Taíno refugees, but the theory seems impossible to prove or disprove.\n\nGarífuna (or Black Carib) is another interesting Arawakan language originating on the islands. It developed as the result of forced migration among people of mixed Arawak, Carib, and African descent. It is estimated to have about 195,800 speakers in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Belize combined.\n\nToday the Arawakan languages with the most speakers are among the more recent \"Ta-\"Arawakan (\"Ta-\"Maipurean) groups: Wayuu [Goajiro], with about 300,000 speakers; and Garifuna, with about 100,000 speakers. The Campa group is next; Asháninca or Campa proper has 15–18,000 speakers; and Ashéninca 18–25,000. After that probably comes Terêna, with 10,000 speakers; and Yanesha' [Amuesha] with 6–8,000.\n\n\n\n"}

It was found in 1996 in the Dutch town of Bergakker, near Tiel (in the Betuwe, once the habitat of the Batavi). There is consensus that the find dates from the period 425-475 and that the inscription is either the singular direct attestation of Frankish (Franconian) or the earliest attestation of Old Dutch (Old Low Franconian).\n\nRunic writing at the time was used along the North Sea coast, in Frisia, but there are very few other known inscriptions from Francia. The inscription can be read as \n\nwhere V is a non-standard rune, apparently a vowel (variously read as \"e\" or \"u\", or as \"any vowel\"). \n\nSeveral readings have been presented in literature. There seems to be a consensus that the \"ann\" means \"give/bestow/grant\". Several authors read the first word as a personal name in the genitive (indicating property), and the last word as meaning \"flame, brand\", a kenning for swords. The third word is read either as \"kusjam\", meaning \"chooser\" or \"chosen\", or as \"ke(i)sjam\" meaning \"cut\" or \"cutter\", also referring to swords or sword wielders.\n\n\nThere is a possibility that the text refers to the Dutch-Flemish folk tale which survives in folk ballad 'Van Here Halewijn' (in English: The Song of Lord Halewijn).

{"id": "8754687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8754687", "title": "Berrichon dialect", "text": "Berrichon dialect\n\nBerrichon is an Oïl language very closely related to French or a dialect of it traditionally spoken in the historical area of the French province of Berry. The word is also used as a demonym and as an adjective meaning \"pertaining to Berry\".\n\nThe dialect evolved out of the langues d'oïl which evolved during the Middle Ages out of the Vulgar Latin spoken in northern Gaul. Its general use in the Berry region began to decline in the sixteenth century as the local aristocracy and bourgeoisie began to adopt standard French, leaving Berrichon as a \"patois\" used by the peasantry in the countryside. Subsequent developments, such as the French Revolution, which created a sense of nationalism, and the establishment of free, mandatory, primary education under the Minister of Public Instruction, Jules Ferry, which greatly expanded the teaching of French, further undermined the position of Berrichon.\n\nThe decline of Berrichon has virtually led to it being regarded as a sub-standard dialect of French rather than a separate language. Additionally, as most speakers in its region now speak standard French, it is no longer possible to say that a Berrichon \"patois\" exists, but rather that a regional version of French does. Nevertheless, traces of Berrichon and its regional varieties remain today. This is exemplified in the continued use of Berrichon terms in spoken French among speakers in the region.\n\nAlthough Berrichon does not have an official grammar or pronunciation, there are general rules as to how it differs from French. Berrichon differentiates between closed and open \"a\". \"R\"s are rolled and emphatic. Words which have the \"o\" sound in standard French are pronounced with a close back rounded vowel, resulting in, for example, \"un houmme\" (man), \"une poumme\" (apple). The \"oi\" [wa] sound becomes \"oé\" [oe]. The suffix -\"eur\" becomes -\"eux\" in Berrichon, and -\"eau\" becomes -\"iau\"; therefore, \"leurs\" (theirs) is \"ieux\" and \"un seau d'eau\" (a bucket of water) is \"un siau d'iau\".\n\nConjugation is also different. The present indicative of the first-person singular, the third-person singular and the third-person plural are all conjugated in the same manner, which results in phrases of the type, \"j'menons les oies\" (\"I lead the geese\"). There is also frequent truncation: \"i m'nons les oies\" (\"they lead the geese\"). Tense endings are also different from standard French, as in the third person plural imperfect ending \"-aient\" is replaced by \"-aint\", e.g., \"\"i's étaint\" instead of \"ils étaient\"\" (\"They used to be\").\n\nIn Berry, it is customary to precede given names with articles: \"la\" for women's names and \"eul\" for men's names.\n\nWhen referring to weather terms, the pronoun \"ça\" is used in place of the French \"il\". For example, \"Il pleut\" (\"It is raining.\") would be \"Ça pleut\" in Berrichon.\n\nExamples of Berrichon vocabulary being used instead of their French counterparts include:\n\n"}
{"id": "2401265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2401265", "title": "Carrier language", "text": "Carrier language\n\nThe Carrier language is a Northern Athabaskan language. It is named after the Dakelh people, a First Nations people of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada, for whom Carrier is the usual English name. People who are referred to as Carrier speak two related languages. One, Babine-Witsuwit'en is sometimes referred to as \"Northern Carrier\". The other, Carrier proper, includes what are sometimes referred to as \"Central Carrier\" and \"Southern Carrier\".\n\nAll dialects of Carrier have essentially the same consonant system, which is shown in this chart.\n\nThere are three series of stops and affricates: aspirated, unaspirated (written voiced in the practical orthography), and ejective.\n\nCarrier once had a dental/alveolar (or laminal/apical) distinction, attested in the earliest grammatical treatise of the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. However, by 1976 this had been leveled to the present alveolar series among younger speakers, and in 1981 the dental/laminal series (marked by underlining the consonant) was said to be found in only the \"very oldest speakers\". Poser (2005) states that it is found in only the most conservative speech. In even the earliest description, there is evidence of the distinction being neutralized.\n\nCarrier has six surface-phonemic vowels: and . The first four are tense in open syllables and lax in closed syllables. The reduced vowel is quite variable in its realization: it approaches immediately preceding and approaches when either or both adjacent consonants are laryngeal. Unlike in some related languages, there is no distinctive nasalization; that is, Carrier does not contrast oral and nasal vowels.\n\nThe great majority of instances of are predictable from the phonotactics, introduced in order to create an acceptable syllable structure. The remaining instances are all found in certain forms of the verb where the morphology requires some vowel to be present.\n\nIn most if not all dialects there are surface-phonemic distinctions of vowel length. However, all of the long vowels that create such distinctions are morphophonemically derived. There is no need to represent vowel length in lexical representations.\n\nCarrier has a very simple tone system of the type often described as pitch accent—it is in fact very similar to the prototypical pitch-accent language, Japanese. In Carrier, a word may or may not have a tonic syllable. If it does not, the pitch rises gradually across the phonological word. If it does have a tonic syllable, then that syllable has a high pitch, the following syllable downsteps to a low pitch, and subsequent syllables until the end of the prosodic unit are also low pitched. Any syllable in the word may carry the accent; if it is the final syllable, then the first syllable of the following word is low pitched, even if it would otherwise be tonic. Representing this phonemic drop in pitch with the downstep symbol , there is a contrast between the surface tone following an unaccented word \"xoh\" \"goose\" compared with the accented word \"yesꜜ\" \"wolf\":\n\nHowever, after a tonic syllable, the high pitch of \"yesꜜ\" \"wolf\" is lost:\n\nIn general the Carrier syllable is maximally CVC. All consonants other than the extremely rare are found in syllable-initial position. The possible coda consonants, on the other hand, are restricted. All of the sonorants except for the extremely rare palatal nasal may occur in the coda, but of the obstruents only the pulmonic unaspirated series occur. Affricates are not found in the coda with the exception of a few instances of . Palatals are also absent from the coda.\n\nWord-internally consonant clusters occur only at the juncture between two syllables. Tautosyllablic clusters are found only word-initially, where any of the onset consonants may be preceded by or .\n\nNasals at all points of articulation are syllabic word-initially preceding a consonant.\n\nThe writing system in general use today is the Carrier Linguistic Committee writing system, a Roman-based system developed in the 1960s by Summer Institute of Linguistics missionaries and a group of Carrier people with whom they worked. The CLC writing system was designed to be typed on a standard English typewriter. It uses numerous digraphs and trigraphs to write the many Carrier consonants not found in English, e.g. for and for , with an apostrophe to mark glottalization, e.g. for the ejective alveolar affricate. Letters generally have their English rather than European values. For example, represents while represents .\n\nThe only diacritic it uses in its standard form is the underscore, which is written under the sibilants (, , , and ) to indicate that the consonant is laminal denti-alveolar rather than apical alveolar. An acute accent is sometimes used to mark high tone, but tone is not routinely written in Carrier.\n\nCarrier was formerly written in a writing system inspired by the Cree Syllabics known variously as the Carrier syllabics or Déné Syllabics. This writing system was widely used for several decades from its inception in 1885 but began to fade in the 1930s. Today only a few people can read it.\n\nA good deal of scholarly material, together with the first edition of the \"Little Catechism\" and the Third Edition of the Prayerbook, is written in the writing system used by Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice in his scholarly work. This writing system is a somewhat idiosyncratic version of the phonetic transcription of the time. It is subphonemic and was never used by Carrier people themselves, though many learned to read the Prayerbook in it.\n\nCarrier nouns are inflected for possession, including the person and number of the possessor. Possession is marked by prefixation as well, in some cases, as changes in the noun stem. Number is marked only on nouns denoting human beings and dogs, and these distinguish only singular and plural. Some dialects of Carrier have no number distinctions in nouns at all.\n\nA noun has six basic personal possessive forms:\n\nPossessive Paradigm of \"stick\"\nReading row-wise, these mean \"my stick\", \"our stick\", \"your (1 person) stick\", \"your (two or more people) stick\", \"his/her/its stick\", and \"their stick\".\n\nHowever, in some dialects, such as that of Stony Creek, there is a distinction between first person dual and first person plural possessors:\n\nPossessive Paradigm of \"stick\" (Stoney Creek dialect)\nIn such dialects, while the 1d and 1p are distinct, the 1d is the same as the 2dp.\n\nThere are five additional third person possessive forms:\n\nThe areal form is used when the possessor is saliently areal, spatial, or an extent of time. The reflexive is used when the subject of the clause and the possessor are the same, whether singular or plural. The disjoint form is used when both subject and possessor are third person singular and are not the same. The plural disjoint form is used when the subject is third person plural, the possessor is third person singular, and the possessor is not one of the individuals in the subject group. The reciprocal form, meaning \"each other's\", was used into the early twentieth century but has since fallen out of use.\n\nThe twelfth possessive form is almost always found on inalienably possessed nouns. These are nouns that may not occur as words in their own right. In Carrier, the great majority of such nouns are either body parts or kinship terms. For example, although we can abstract the stem from forms for \"foot\" such as ('my foot'), ('our feet'), and ('his foot'), by itself is not a word. It must either occur with a possessive prefix or as part of a compound, such as ('sock'). To refer to an inalienably possessed noun without specifying its owner, the indefinite possessive prefix is used. The approximate equivalent of \"a foot\" is therefore .\n\nTo describe alienable possession of an inalienably possessed noun, the regular possessive forms are used with the indefinite form as a base rather than the bare stem. Thus, to say \"my foot\" if the foot is not your own foot but is, for example, a rabbit's foot, you would say . (The fact that the vowel is rather than is the result of a phonological rule that changes to immediately preceding in noun prefixes and in the disjunct zone of the verb.)\n\nMost Dakelh nouns do not have distinct singular and plural forms.\nHow many items are under discussion may be inferred from context\nor may be specified by using a number or quantifier; otherwise, it\nremains ambiguous. With very limited exceptions, only nouns denoting\nhuman beings and dogs have distinct plural forms.\n\nThe most common way of forming the plural is by adding the suffix . Thus, we have \"man\", \"men\", \"Dakelh person\", \"Dakelh people\".\n\nNouns derived from verbs by adding the suffix form their plurals by replacing with . Thus we have \"teacher\", \"teachers\".\n\nA smaller but nonetheless considerable number of nouns take the plural suffix , e.g. \"dog\", \"dogs\". This is the usual way of making the plural of kinship terms, e.g. \"our mother\", \"our mothers\". The plural suffix is occasionally heard on kinship terms, but the suffix is more widely used and generally considered to be more correct. The plural of \"dog\" is invariably , never .\n\nIn addition, there are a handful of nouns with irregular\nplurals:\n\nThe exceptions to the statement that only nouns denoting human beings and dogs have distinct plurals are all nouns derived from verbs. The form of the underlying verb may vary with number in such a way as to create distinct number forms for the derived noun.\n\nWhere the deverbal noun is derived by means of the agentive suffix the verb is almost invariably in the third person singular form, which is to say, not marked for number. Plurality in these forms is normally marked only by the use of the duo-plural agentive suffix in place of singular . Zero-derived agentive nouns may show plurality by means of subject markers. For example, \"shaman\" may be either , with an overt agentive suffix, but the zero-marked is more common. There are two plural forms: , with the duo-plural agentive suffix, and , in which the zero-marked form is based on the plural form of the verb.\n\nThere are two other cases in which the underlying verb may lead to a number distinction in the derived nouns. One is when the verb is restricted in the number of its absolutive argument. For example, there are two verbs \"to kill\", one that takes a singular or dual object, another that takes a strictly plural object. Since the word \"prey\" is derived from \"kill\", there\nare a singular-dual form , based on the stem\nbased on the stem \"kill three or more\".\n\nThe other case in which the underlying verb induces a number distinction in the derived noun is when the verb contains a prefix such as distributive . For example, \"cross-road\" has the duo-plural\n. Similarly, \"rabbit trail\" has the duo-plural . Such examples arise because the \"noun\"\nprefix.\n\nEven if a noun possesses a plural form, it is not necessary for it to take on the plural form in order to have a plural meaning. Indeed, there is a strong tendency to avoid overt marking of the plural if plurality is indicated in other ways, in particular, by an immediately following possessed noun. For example, the full form of \"Dakelh language\" is , literally \"the words of the Dakelh people\". Here consists of \"Dakelh person with the plural suffix , and is the third person plural possessed form of \"words\". The plurality of the possessor is indicated by the use of the third person duo-plural possessive prefix instead of the third person singular . The form , in which is not overtly plural-marked, is much preferred.\n\nMost postpositions are inflected for their object in a manner closely resembling the marking of possession on nouns. The inflected forms are used when the object is not a full noun phrase. Here is the paradigm of \"for\":\n\nObject Paradigm of \"for\"\n\nThe postposition \"by means of\" is unusual in being uninflectable. At the other extreme, the postposition \"together with\" is always inflected, even when its object is an overt noun phrase.\n\nWhereas the reciprocal possessive form of nouns is obsolete, the reciprocal object of postpositions remains in common use. The form , for example, may be used in roughly the same contexts as the English phrase \"for each other\".\n\nThe Carrier verb is extremely complex. A single verb may have hundreds of thousands of forms. Verbs are marked for the person and number of the subject, object, and indirect object, tense, mood, numerous aspectual categories, and negation. The subjects of verbs, and in some dialects objects and indirect objects, distinguish singular, dual, and plural numbers. Verbs are also marked for numerous \"derivational\" categories. For example, a basic motion verb, such as \"walk\" has derivatives meaning \"walk into water\", \"walk into a hole\", \"walk ashore\", \"walk around\" and \"walk erroneously\" (that is, \"get lost walking\").\n\nThe basic paradigm of a verb consists of three persons in three numbers, with the tenses and modes Imperfective, Perfective, Future, and Optative, in both affirmative and negative forms. Notice how the stem of the verb changes with tense/aspect/mode and negation, e.g. in the Imperfective Affirmative but in the Imperfective Negative and in the Perfective Affirmative. In addition to the stem, the forms below contain the prefix \"around, in a loop\".\n\n<br>\nGo Around By Boat\nCarrier has multiple systems of noun classification, several of which are realized on the verb. One of these, the system of absolutive or \"gender\" classifiers, consists of the prefixes , , and , which indicate that the absolutive argument (the subject of an intransitive verb or the object of a transitive verb) is round, stick-like, or areal/spatial, respectively. Some verbs can take any or none of these prefixes. Others can take only a subset or none at all. For example, the verb \"to be white\" has the forms:\nIn general terms, Carrier is a head-final language: the verb comes at the end of the clause, adpositions are postpositions rather than prepositions, and complementizers follow their clause. However, it is not consistently head-final: in head-external relative clauses, the relative clause follows the head noun. Carrier has both head-internal and head-external relative clauses. The subject usually precedes the object if one is present.\n\nCarrier is an \"everything drop\" language. A verb can form a grammatical sentence by itself. It is not in general necessary for the subject or object to be expressed overtly by a noun phrase or pronoun.\n\nVerb-internal negation has low scope, meaning that, with certain exceptions, the scope of negation is restricted to the verb itself. Thus, a sentence like:\n\nis acceptable since the object marker (underlyingly just , with epenthetic changed to because it immediately precedes in the disjunct zone) is part of the verb, but\n\nis bizarre because the object \"tobacco\" is a separate noun phrase. The bizarreness results from the fact that the negative morphology of the verb does not have scope over the NP object. In order to bring the object within the scope of negation, it must follow the negative particle :\n\nCarrier is generally regarded as one of three members of the central British Columbia subgroup of Athabascan, the other two being Babine-Witsuwit'en and Chilcotin. As noted above, the term \"Carrier\" has often been applied to both Carrier proper and Babine-Witsuwit'en but this identification is now rejected by specialists. The Ethnologue treats Carrier proper as consisting of two languages, Carrier (code: crx) and Southern Carrier (code: caf), where the latter consists of the dialects of the Ulkatcho, Kluskus, Nazko, and Red Bluff bands. More recent research disputes the treatment of \"Southern Carrier\" as a distinct language and in fact classifies this dialect group as one of two parts of a larger \"Southern Carrier\" dialect group that contains all of Carrier proper except for the Stuart/Trembleur Lake dialect. Southern Carrier in the sense of the Ethnologue, that is, the Blackwater dialect group, is mutually comprehensible with all other Carrier dialects.\n\nCurrent research divides Carrier into two major dialect groups, a \"Stuart-Trembleur\" Lake group, and a \"Southern\" group. The Southern group, in turn, is divided into two subgroups, the \"Fraser-Nechako\" group, comprising the communities of Cheslatta, Stellako, Nadleh, Saik'uz, and Lheidli, and the \"Blackwater\" group, comprising the communities of Lhk'acho (Ulgatcho), Lhoosk'uz (Kluskus), Nazko, and Lhtakoh (Red Bluff).\n\nMuch of the literature distinguishes \"Central Carrier\" from \"Southern Carrier\". Unfortunately, the usage of these terms is quite variable. Almost all material in or about \"Central Carrier\" is in the Stuart Lake dialect. However, Central Carrier cannot be taken to be a synonym for Stuart-Trembleur Lake dialect because some of the more northerly of the Southern Carrier dialects, particularly Saik'uz dialect, are sometimes included in Central Carrier.\n\nAlthough all speakers of all varieties of Carrier can communicate with each other with little difficulty, the dialects are quite diverse. They differ from each other not only in phonological details and lexicon but in morphology and even syntax.\n\nCarrier is neighbored on the west by Babine-Witsuwit'en and Haisla, to the north by Sekani, to the southeast by Shuswap, to the south by Chilcotin, and to the southwest by Nuxalk. Furthermore, in the past few centuries, with the westward movement of the Plains Cree, there has been contact with the Cree from the East. Carrier has borrowed from some of these languages, but apparently not in large numbers. Loans from Cree include ('cow') from Cree (which originally meant \"buffalo\" but extended to \"cow\" already in Cree) and ('money, precious metal'). There are also loans from languages that do not directly neighbor Carrier territory. A particularly interesting example is ('berry, fruit'), a loan from Gitksan, which has been borrowed into all Carrier dialects and has displaced the original Athabascan word.\n\nEuropean contact has brought loans from a number of sources. The majority of demonstrable loans into Carrier are from French, though it is not generally clear whether they come directly from French or via Chinook Jargon. Loans from French include ('chicken') (from French \"le coq\" 'rooster'), (from \"le sel\" 'salt'), and ('angel'). As these examples show, the French article is normally incorporated into the Carrier borrowing. A single loan from Spanish is known: ('canvas, tarpaulin'), apparently acquired from Spanish-speaking packers.\n\nThe trade language Chinook Jargon came into use among Carrier people as a result of European contact. Most Carrier people never knew Chinook Jargon. It appears to have been known in most areas primarily by men who had spent time freighting on the Fraser River. Knowledge of Chinook Jargon may have been more common in the southwestern part of Carrier country due to its use at Bella Coola. The southwestern dialects have more loans from Chinook Jargon than other dialects. For example, while most dialects use the Cree loan described above for \"money\", the southwestern dialects use , which is from Chinook Jargon. The word ('chief') is a loan from Chinook Jargon.\n\nEuropean contact brought many new objects and ideas. The names for some were borrowed, but in most cases terms have been created using the morphological resources of the language, or by extending or shifting the meaning of existing terms. Thus, now means not only \"rope\" but also \"wire\", while has shifted from its original meaning of \"arrow\" to mean \"cartridge\" and has shifted from \"bow\" to \"rifle\". , originally \"leeches\" now also means \"pasta\".\nA microwave oven is referred to as ('that by means of which things are warmed quickly'). \"Mustard\" is ('children's feces'), presumably after the texture and color rather than the flavor.\n\nLike most of the languages of British Columbia, Carrier is an endangered language. Only about 10% of Dakelh people now speak the Carrier language, hardly any of them children. Members of the generation following that of the last speakers can often understand the language but they do not contribute to its transmission.\n\nCarrier is taught as a second language in both public and band schools throughout Carrier territory. This instruction provides an acquaintance with the language but has not proven effective in producing functional knowledge of the language. Carrier has also been taught at the University of Northern British Columbia, the College of New Caledonia, and the University of British Columbia.\n\nThe Yinka Dene Language Institute (YDLI) is charged with the maintenance and promotion of Carrier language and culture. Its activities include research, archiving, curriculum development, teacher training, literacy instruction, and production of teaching and reference materials.\n\nPrior to the founding of YDLI in 1988 the Carrier Linguistic Committee, a group based in Fort Saint James affiliated with the Summer Institute of Linguistics, produced a number of publications in Carrier, literacy materials for several dialects, a 3000-entry dictionary of the Stuart Lake dialect, and various other materials.\n\nThe Carrier Linguistic Committee is largely responsible for literacy among younger speakers of the language. The \"Carrier Bible Translation Committee\" produced a translation of the New Testament that was published in 1995. An adaptation to Blackwater dialect appeared in 2002.\n\nHere are the Carrier names for some of the major places in Carrier territory, written in the Carrier Linguistic Committee writing system:\n\n\nThe earliest record of the language consists of a list of 25 words recorded by Alexander MacKenzie on June 22, 1793. This is followed by a few Carrier words mentioned in the journal of Simon Fraser for the year 1806 and by a list of over 300 words given in an appendix to his journal by Daniel Harmon, published in 1820. The first known text by native speakers of Carrier is the Barkerville Jail Text of 1885.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3809278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3809278", "title": "Chaha language", "text": "Chaha language\n\nChaha or Cheha (in Chaha and Amharic: ቸሃ \"čehā\" or \"čexā\") is a Gurage language spoken in central Ethiopia, mainly within the Gurage Zone in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region. It is also spoken by Gurage settlers in Ethiopian cities, especially Addis Ababa. Chaha is known to many phonologists and morphologists for its very complex morphophonology.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, the dialects of SBG (Sebat Bet Gurage) are Chaha (\"čäxa\"), Ezha (\"äža\"), Gumer (or Gwemare, \"gʷämarä\"), Gura, Gyeto (or Gyeta, \"gʸäta\"), and Muher (or Mwahr, \"mʷäxǝr\"). However, some of these are sometimes considered languages in their own right. In particular, Muher diverges so much from the other dialects that it is not necessarily even treated as a member of the Western Gurage group to which SBG belongs.\n\nThis article focuses on the Chaha dialect, which has been studied more than the others.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all examples are Chaha.\n\nSBG has a fairly typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. There is the usual set of ejective consonants as well as plain voiceless and voiced consonants. However, the Chaha language also has a larger set of palatalized and labialized consonants than most other Ethiopian Semitic languages. Besides the typical seven vowels of these languages, SBG has open-mid front () and back vowels (). Some of the dialects have both short and long vowel phonemes, and some have nasalized vowels.\n\nThe charts below show the phones of the Chaha dialect; exactly how many phonemes there are is a matter of controversy because of the complexity of SBG morphophonology.\nFor the representation of SBG sounds, this article uses a modification of a system that is common (though not universal) among linguists who work on Ethiopian Semitic languages, but it differs somewhat from the conventions of the International Phonetic Alphabet. When the IPA symbol is different, it is indicated in brackets in the\ncharts.\n\nIn addition to the complexity in verb morphology characteristic of all Semitic languages, SBG exhibits another level of complexity because of the intricate relationship between the set of consonants in the root of a verb and how they are realized in a particular form of that verb or a noun derived from that verb.\nFor example, the verb meaning 'open' has a root consisting of the consonants {\"kft\"} (as it does in most other Ethiopian Semitic languages).\nIn some forms we see all of these consonants.\nFor example, the third person singular masculine perfective Chaha form meaning 'he opened' is \"käfätä-m\".\nHowever, when the impersonal of this same verb is used, meaning roughly 'he was opened', two of the stem consonants are changed: 'käfʷäč-i-m'.\n\nAt least three different phonological processes play a role in SBG morphophonology.\n\nIn most Ethiopian Semitic languages, gemination, that is, consonant lengthening, plays a role in distinguishing words from one another and in the grammar of verbs.\n\nFor example, in Amharic, the second consonant of a three-consonant verb root is doubled in the perfective: {\"sdb\"} 'insult', \"säddäbä\" 'he insulted'. In Chaha and some other SBG dialects (but not Ezha or Muher), gemination is replaced by devoicing. For example, the verb root meaning 'insult' is the same in SBG as in Amharic (with \"b\" replaced by \"β\"), but in the perfective the second consonant becomes \"t\" in the non-geminating dialects: \"sätäβä-m\" 'he insulted'.\n\nOnly voiced consonants can be devoiced: \"b/β\" → \"p\", \"d\" → \"t\", \"g\" → \"k\", \"bʷ\" → \"pʷ\", \"ǧ\" → \"č\", \"gʸ\" → \"kʸ\", \"gʷ\" → \"kʷ\", \"z\" → \"s\", \"ž\" → \"š\".\n\nThe \"devoiced/geminated\" form of \"r\" is \"n\".\nOther voiced consonants are not devoiced.\n\nSeveral morphological processes cause consonants to be labialized (rounded).\nFor example, from the three-consonant verb root {\"gkr\"} 'be straight', there is the derived adjective \"gʷǝkʷǝr\" 'straight'.\n\nLabial and velar consonants can be labialized: \"p\" → \"pʷ\", \"b\" → \"bʷ\", \"β\" → \"w\", \"f\" → \"fʷ\", \"k\" → \"kʷ\", \"ḳ\" → \"ḳʷ\", \"g\" → \"gʷ\", \"x\" → \"xʷ\".\n\nSeveral morphological processes cause consonants to be palatalized.\nFor example, the second-person feminine singular form of verbs in the imperfective and jussive/imperative palatalizes one of the root consonants (if one is palatalizable): {\"kft\"} 'open', \"tǝkäft 'you (m.) open', \"tǝkäfč 'you (f.) open'.\n\nDental and velar consonants can be palatalized: \"t\" → \"č\", \"ṭ\" → \"č̣\", \"d\" → \"ǧ\", \"s\" → \"š\", \"z\" → \"ž\", \"k\" → \"kʸ\", \"ḳ\" → \"ḳʸ\", \"g\" → \"gʸ\", \"x\" → \"xʸ\".\n\n\"r\" palatalizes to \"y\".\n\nIn one morphological environment the reverse process takes place.\nIn the imperative/jussive form of one class of verbs, the first consonant in the root is depalatalized if this is possible.\nFor example, the verb meaning 'return' (transitive) has the stem consonants {\"žpr\"} in other forms, for example, žäpärä-m\" 'he returned', but the \"ž\" is depalatalized to \"z\" in the imperative zäpǝr\" 'return! (m.)'.\n\nThe relationship among \"n\", \"r\", and \"l\" is complex. At least within verb stems, and may be treated as allophones of a single phoneme. The consonant is realized as at the beginning of the word, when this is a \"gemination\" environment, and when it ends the penultimate syllable of the word. appears otherwise.\n\nBanksira also argues that \"k\" is an allophone of \"x\" and \"b\" an allophone of \"β\".\n\nChaha is transcribed using the Ge'ez (Ethiopic) writing system. It was originally developed for the now-extinct Ge'ez language, and now serves as the orthography for Amharic and Tigrinya. Although there are still relatively few texts in the language, three novels have appeared in the Chaha dialect (by Sahlä and Gäbräyäsus Haylämaryam).\n\nTo represent the palatalized consonants not found in Ge'ez, Amharic, or Tigrinya, modified characters were introduced to the script, such as using wedges on the tops. The original use of this was done in the New Testament published by the Ethiopian Bible Society, then for the entire Bible; it has now become generally adopted.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "539541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=539541", "title": "Congressional Debate", "text": "Congressional Debate\n\nCongressional Debate (also known as Student Congress, Legislative Debate) is a form of interscholastic high school debate in the United States. The National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA), National Catholic Forensic League (NCFL), many state associations and national invitational tournaments offer Congressional Debate as an event. Each organization and tournament offers its own rules, although the National Forensic League has championed standardization since 2007, when it began to ask its districts to use one of a number of procedures for qualification to its National Tournament. The Pakistan Student Congress event is a conference, and not interscholastic competition.\n\nIn Congressional Debate, high school students emulate members of the United States Congress by debating bills and resolutions. Before the event, each school submits mock legislation to each tournament. After the legislation has been compiled, it is distributed to each participating team. Each team attempts to research as many topics as possible, with the goal of being able to speak on both sides of every legislation.\n\nUnlike other debate events, students drive the topics for discussion by drafting their own legislation for submission to tournaments. The bills and resolutions must be national in scope, and must either fall within jurisdiction for lawmaking by the United States Congress as a bill, or express a specific position and/or recommendation for further action outside of Congress' jurisdiction as a resolution. A popular type of resolution is to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, which requires action by state legislatures.\n\nTournaments may review legislation submitted before sharing the overall docket with all participating schools. Contestants from each school will research and prepare arguments both in favor and against each legislation in the docket before arriving at the tournament.\n\nStudents attending each tournament are divided up into sections of 10-30 (usually 15-20). These individual rooms are called chambers, and sometimes labeled as a \"House\", or \"Senate,\" depending on the region and the tournament.\n\nDuring each phase of a tournament (preliminary and elimination), there is at least one round, often referred to as a \"session.\" The National Forensic League defines a session as having:\n\nWhile larger tournaments may have preliminary rounds that precede elimination rounds (semifinals, finals, etc.), smaller tournaments may not have elimination rounds and may recognize and award students in individual chambers.\n\nRounds usually begin with a method for determining which bills will be debated and in which order, referred to as the agenda. This most commonly happens with a nominated agenda at the tournament, although some areas have a system of informal caucusing or highly organized committees, which convene to review legislation that has been subdivided by the tournament to address a specific topic area, such as is done in the National Catholic Forensic League and Illinois Congressional Debate Association. A common committee structure includes: \"Public welfare\", \"Economics,\" and \"Foreign Affairs.\"\n\nCongressional Debate speeches last up to three minutes. The first speech on each legislation, known as the \"authorship,\" goes to a debater who wrote the legislation, or from the same school of the author. If nobody from the author's school is present, another debater gives a sponsorship speech, which is functionally identical to an authorship. This first speech is followed by a two-minute questioning period. One three-minute speech in opposition (negation) follows it, with another mandatory two minutes of questioning. After these initial speeches, debate alternates in favor and opposition to the legislation with three-minute speeches and one minute of questioning. Within each speech, contestants develop two or three organized, logical arguments supported by credible evidence for why the chamber should vote for or against the given legislation. The general format of a speech is as follows:\n\nQuestioning, traditionally, has been the standard set by the debate rules. One speaker at a time has an opportunity to ask one question at a time, moderated by the presiding officer. Typically, questions attempt to expose faults in the speech given. Sometimes speakers upholding the same side as the current speaker will ask a \"friendly question,\" seeking agreement, although in some regions, this is discouraged. Questions, and their respective answers, are to be short and to the point, as delays will unfairly cut into other speakers' questioning time.\n\nRules do not allow for \"prefacing,\" where students formulate a statement or argument as part of their question; rather, they must simply ask a question, and only a question.\n\nThe debate rules also provides for direct questioning, if the standing rules of the organization allow for it, where the speaker and questioner can engage in direct dialogue without moderation from the chair. This is done in 30- or 60-second blocks of time, allowing the questioner to engage the floor speaker to greater depth. This is used to sometimes build arguments that the questioner uses in a later speech, similar to cross-examination in other competitive debate events. At tournaments where this is practiced, the presiding officer is either required or strongly advised to keep a separate questioning priority, to ensure equal opportunity for questioners. Several tournaments have piloted this method since the National Forensic League suggested this as a result of discussions with its Congressional Debate Rules and Recommendations Committee in 2009.\n\nSome leagues and tournaments still use a protocol where the balanced of unused speaking time is reserved for questioning, rather than having a specific period.\n\nWhile some student questioners feel the need to ask if the speaker yields, this is unnecessary under procedure, because the standing rules of the organizations and tournaments provide specific parameters for questioning periods that already establish when questioning begins.\n\nWhile all Congressional Debate competition rely upon parliamentary procedure as practiced in Congress (i.e. the Standing Rules of the United States Senate or the Procedures of the United States House of Representatives) as the underpinning for how sessions are conducted, there may be slight variations in how the competition itself is run. Each chamber has a presiding officer (PO) or chair. At the beginning of each session, contestants in the chamber nominate candidates. Usually, each nominee gives a brief candidacy speech introducing themselves and stating their qualifications. Contestants then elect a presiding officer by majority via individual, secret balloting.\n\nThe presiding officer's job is to facilitate fair, balanced, and efficient debate during the session in which they have been elected, primarily through recognition of speakers and questioners (see section below). At the end of many tournaments students in the chamber vote on which presiding officer was the best, and some tournaments have a separate means for judge recognition of presiding officers.\n\nThe most common duties of the presiding officer are:\n\nThe presiding officer always calls for an author or sponsor for the first legislation in order, and the author always gets first right of refusal. When a session starts, there usually are not predetermined methods for selecting contestants for their first speech. Once speakers have been recognized, the universal rule in all leagues and tournaments is to first recognize those who have not spoken, or those who have spoken least (referred to as \"precedence\"). Beyond that, the National Forensic League and common practice have dictated that students also consider who spoke earlier (referred to as \"recency\"). Before precedence and recency are established, the presiding officer must recognize speakers fairly and equitably. The National Forensic League and many tournaments have (as of 2012) ruled the use of methods that tie the number of questions asked or motions made to speaker recognition, as well as how many times a student has stood, out of order, because they result in competitors simply \"playing the game\".\n\nOften, coaches will instruct students who preside to call on contestants for early speeches that they do not know, and/or who are less experienced. Additionally, since debate becomes more complex after more arguments have been introduced, later speakers bear a higher burden for clash and refutation.\n\nIn some areas, before precedence and recency are established, priority cards are distributed or numbers are designated to each student, giving the presiding officer a clear and objective directive as to whom to recognize. This has been criticized by longtime National Forensic League Congress Coordinator Harold Keller for entirely removing the dynamism of the activity from students' hands.\n\nThe National Forensic League's Table of Parliamentary Motions is in use by almost every organization that conducts Congressional Debate competition, including the National Catholic Forensic League. The motions are similar, if not usually identical to those used in Congress with a few exceptions, including the one-thirds second required to amend a motion or legislation, to prevent abuse of that protocol.\n\nThe presiding officer never should call for motions; rather, contestants should rise and say \"motion,\" and then that they move a specific motion.\n\nThe following motions are used at almost all Congressional Debate tournaments:\n\nThese motions are allowed at some Congressional Debate tournaments, depending on the region and the style of debate:\n\nThis requires a suspension of the rules.*\n\nThe term \"main motion\" refers to the primary question before the assembly; in Congressional Debate, this is the legislation as presented on the agenda, so it is never necessary for a contestant to specifically move the main motion. Main motions can be changed or affected by a variety of subsidiary motions.\n\nThe following motions end debate on the pending main motion:\n\nOnly one main motion is in order at any given time. If the chamber wishes to change to another legislation while another is still being considered, the chamber must end debate (which could include pausing debate by laying on the table) before changing to the desired item. Some tournaments establish a minimum time before the previous question can be moved; others limit how long each legislation may be debated. When debate gets one-sided, or \"stale,\" often a contestant will rise and move the previous question, which requires two-thirds of the chamber concurring. If this motion fails, the presiding officer should rule any immediate subsequent motion to \"lay on the table\" (requiring a simple majority vote) out of order, since that is an abusive way to circumvent the spirit of the rules to allow the minority a voice before majority rules.\n\nAfter the previous question has been moved, the presiding officer calls for a vote on the legislation, and after counting votes, announces whether the ayes or noes have it, and the motion carries or is defeated. Note that \"yay\" and \"nay\" are archaic modes of voting expression that are no longer used in parliamentary parlance.\n\nIt is commonplace for students to move a recess following voting.\n\nAmendments are an important tool that can add nuance and perspective to debate on a particular issue, even though they are not practiced as often as they once were. To amend, a student will submit the amendment in writing to the head table (often rising to a point of personal privilege and seeking permission to approach the rostrum). The presiding officer (often in consultation with the parliamentarian) will first determine if the amendment is germane; or if it changes the original intent of the legislation, it is ruled dilatory. The author of the amendment then moves to amend, and if the presiding officer rules it germane, they read it aloud to the chamber and calls for a one-thirds second (usually by voice vote). If one-third of the chamber concurs to consider the amendment, the presiding officer then calls for a speech in support of the amendment. At most tournaments, the speech introducing or sponsoring the amendment is not guaranteed to its author, and in fact, it is common practice in some areas for a contestant to immediately move the previous question on the amendment. If that happens, it is not debated before the chamber passes or defeats the amendment. If the amendment passes, subsequent debate on the legislation must consider the legislation as amended.\n\nJudges either serve as a scorers or parliamentarians. Scorers judge individual sessions\n\nWhile judging a speech is clearly, to a certain extent, subjective, there are certain key standards that distinguish effectiveness:\n\nThe presiding officer always is taken into consideration for recognition in the chamber by judges (usually through ranking at the end of the session), and some tournaments have both the scorers and parliamentarian evaluate the presiding officer, while others just have one or the other do so. The following key standards distinguish effectiveness:\n\nIn addition to judges who score speeches, most tournaments have a parliamentarian in each chamber. Unlike scorers, who generally rotate each session, the parliamentarian remains in one chamber for all sessions (preliminary, semifinal or final). The parliamentarian's role is a fairly passive one; their main purpose is to serve as a reference on parliamentary procedure in case there is confusion or a dispute the presiding officer cannot resolve. Unless either the presiding officer makes (or fails to correct) a major error in procedure or else the debate gets bogged down the parliamentarian will generally not intervene in the proceedings unless asked by someone in the chamber.\n\nIn Utah, the presiding officer appoints a member of the chamber to act as parliamentarian. This student keeps record of speaking priority/recency for the chair. The student parliamentarian is considered a member of the body and continues to participate, and because of the appointed nature of the office, it is not counted as a speech. The parliamentarian serves at the chair's pleasure, and there are often occasions the chair will not appoint a parliamentarian, rather, handling duties her/himself.\n\nThe first high school Congress was held in 1938 by the National Forensic League. Like other forms of debate, it emphasizes clash of ideas, and consideration of questions of policy (bills) and value (resolutions). It operates like a forensic speech event with sectioning of multiple entries per section and comparative ranking and rating by points (as opposed to pairing just two entries and wins/losses). Since 2000, the event has been growing nationwide, added by several states as State Tournament event, and added to numerous large invitational tournaments.\n\nIn the past decade, Congressional Debate has spread widely across the debate community. The first major tournament outside of NFL and NCFL nationals to hold Congressional Debate was the Harvard University Tournament traditionally held near President's Day weekend in February. Other major tournaments which host congress competitions include The Barkley Forum for High Schools at Emory University, The University of Florida Blue Key, Yale, Princeton, the Villiger tournament in Philadelphia, the Glenbrooks tournament in Chicago, the Crestian Classic in Florida, Pennsbury, Princeton, George Mason, the Minneapple Debate Tournament in Minnesota, Stanford, the California Invitational at UC Berkeley, and the Sunvitational in Florida. In addition, Congress is now one of the official events at the debate Tournament of Champions, hosted by the University of Kentucky. Students who achieve a high level of competitive success at other national tournaments qualify to compete at the TOC, which brings together some of the best congresspersons from across the nation. The nomenclature of \"congressional debate\" is also the result of a shift in recent times toward a more debate-oriented category. In the past, the category focused more on simulating the Congress through oratory skills, hence the name \"student congress.\" The trend is to strike a balance between eloquent speech and reasoned debate.\n\n\n"}

Crossing was used to create eth (ð), but eth has an uncial as its base whereas \"đ\" is based on the straight-backed roman \"d\". Crossed \"d\" is a letter in the alphabets of several languages and is used in linguistics as a phonetic symbol.\n\nIn the lowercase, the crossbar is usually drawn through the ascender, but when used as a phonetic symbol it may be preferred to draw it through the bowl, in which case it is known as a barred \"d\". In some African languages' orthographies, such as that of Moro, the barred \"d\" is preferred.\n\nIn the uppercase, the crossbar normally crosses just the left stem, but in Vietnamese and Moro it may sometimes cross the entire letter.\nThe \"DE\" ligature should not be confused with the \"Đ\". That ligature was used stylistically in pre-19th century Spanish as a contraction for \"de\", as a D with an E superimposed. For example, \"Universidad DE Guadalajara\".\n\nA lowercase \"đ\" appeared alongside a lowercase retroflex D in a 1982 revision of the African reference alphabet. This revision of the alphabet eliminated uppercase forms, so there was no conflict between \"ɖ\" and \"đ\".\n\n\"Đ\" was used in Medieval Latin to mark abbreviations of words containing the letter \"d\". For example, could stand for \"of the heirs\". Similar crossbars were added to other letters to form abbreviations.\n\nThe crossed \"d\" was introduced by Serbian philologist Đuro Daničić in 1878 for use in Serbo-Croatian in his \"Dictionary of the Croatian or Serbian Language\", replacing the older digraphs \"dj\" and \"gj\". Daničić modeled the letter after the Icelandic or Anglo-Saxon letter eth, albeit representing a different sound, the affricate . In 1892 it was officially introduced in Croatian and Slavonian schools (in the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia where the Croatian language was official) and so definitively added to Gaj’s Latin alphabet. The letter thereafter gradually entered daily use, spreading throughout Serbo-Croatian and then to Macedonian (its Latin transliterations heavily influenced by Serbo-Croatian from the Yugoslav period).\n\nThe crossed \"d\" is today considered a distinct letter, and is placed between Dž and E in alphabetical order. Its Cyrillic equivalent is Ђ ђ. Its partial equivalent in Macedonian is Ѓ ѓ (because only some dialects contain the sound). When a true \"đ\" is not available or desired, it is transcribed as \"dj\" in modern Serbo-Croatian, and as \"gj\" in Macedonian. The use of \"dj\" in place of \"đ\" used to be more common in Serbo-Croatian texts, but is now considered obsolete and discouraged by style guides.\n\nIn the present-day orthographies of Northern Sami, Inari Sami and Skolt Sami, \"đ\" represents the fricative . It is considered a distinct letter and placed between D and E in alphabetical order.\n\n\"Đ\" is the seventh letter of the Vietnamese alphabet, after \"D\" and before \"E\". Traditionally, digraphs and trigraphs like \"CH\" and \"NGH\" were considered letters as well, making \"Đ\" the eighth letter. \"Đ\" is a letter in its own right, rather than a ligature or letter-diacritic combination; therefore, \"đá\" would come after \"dù\" in any alphabetical listing.\n\n\"Đ\" represents a voiced alveolar implosive () or, according to Thompson (1959), a preglottalized voiced alveolar stop (). Whereas \"D\" is pronounced as some sort of dental or alveolar stop in most Latin alphabets, an unadorned \"D\" in Vietnamese represents either (Hanoian) or (Saigonese).\n\nThe Vietnamese alphabet was formally described for the first time in the 17th-century text , attributed to a Portuguese Jesuit missionary, possibly Francisco de Pina or Filipe Sibin. This passage about the letter \"Đ\" was later incorporated into Alexandre de Rhodes' seminal :\n\nOn older typewriters, was located where would be in the French AZERTY layout. Alternatively, a hyphen can be overstruck onto a D.\n\nOn computers without support for a Vietnamese character set or Unicode, \"Đ\" is encoded as codice_1 and \"đ\" as codice_2 according to the Vietnamese Quoted-Readable standard. Vietnamese computer users typically input \"Đ\" as in the Telex and VIQR input methods or as in the VNI input method. In the absence of an input method, the and Microsoft Windows Vietnamese keyboard layouts map ZA0-09 ( on a U.S. keyboard) to \"đ\", or \"Đ\" when holding down . The Windows layout also maps ZA0-11 () to ₫.\n\nOther modes of communication also have dedicated representations of \"Đ\". In Vietnamese Braille, it is , which corresponds to \"D\" in French Braille. In the Vietnamese manual alphabet, \"Đ\" is produced by touching the thumb to the index finger. In Morse code, it is rendered – · · – · ·, corresponding to Telex's \"DD\".\n\nThe lowercase \"đ\" is used in some phonetic transcription schemes to represent a voiced dental fricative (English \"th\" in \"this\"). Eth (ð) is more commonly used for this purpose, but the crossed \"d\" has the advantage of being able to be typed on a standard typewriter, by overlaying a hyphen over a \"d\".\n\nA minuscule form of the letter, đ, is the symbol of the đồng, the currency of Vietnam, by a 1953 decree by Ho Chi Minh. The South Vietnamese đồng, on the other hand, was symbolized \"Đ.\", in majuscule. In Unicode, the Vietnamese đồng symbol is properly represented by , but is often used instead. In Vietnamese, the đồng sign is written after the amount in superscript, often underlined.\n\nThe uppercase eth (Ð) is also now used to symbolize the cryptocurrency Dogecoin. The idea originated in December 2013 on the website Reddit when a user realized that the symbol wasn't currently being used for any other currency, and the community believed it was fitting for Dogecoin.\n\nDispersity is represented by the symbol Đ, and is a measure of the heterogeneity of sizes of molecules or particles in a mixture, referring to either molecular mass or degree of polymerization.\n\n\"Đ\" and \"đ\" are encoded in Unicode as U+0110 and U+0111 ; in Latin-2, Latin-4 and Latin-10 as D0 and F0 respectively; and, in Latin-6 as A9 and B9 respectively. In PostScript they are Dcroat, Dmacron, Dslash, dcroat, dmacron and dslash. In Unicode, both crossed \"d\" and barred \"d\" are considered glyph variants of U+0111.\n\nUnicode has a distinct code point for the visually very similar capital eth, Ð, U+00D0, which can lead to confusion.\n\nAs part of WGL4, \"Đ\" and \"đ\" can be expected to display correctly even on older Windows systems.\n\n"}

{"id": "161708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161708", "title": "Endangered language", "text": "Endangered language\n\nAn endangered language, or moribund language, is a language that is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers and becomes a \"dead language\". If no one can speak the language at all, it becomes an \"extinct language\". A dead language may still be studied through recordings or writings, but it is still dead or extinct unless there are fluent speakers. Although languages have always become extinct throughout human history, they are currently dying at an accelerated rate because of globalization, neocolonialism and linguicide (language killing).\n\nLanguage shift most commonly occurs when speakers switch to a language associated with social or economic power or spoken more widely, the ultimate result being language death. The general consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages currently spoken and that between 50% and 90% of them will have become extinct by the year 2100. The 20 most common languages, each with more than 50 million speakers, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, but most languages are spoken by fewer than 10,000 people.\n\nThe first step towards language death is \"potential endangerment\". This is when a language faces strong external pressure, but there are still communities of speakers who pass the language to their children. The second stage is \"endangerment\". Once a language has reached the endangerment stage, there are only a few speakers left and children are, for the most part, not learning the language. The third stage of language extinction is \"seriously endangered\". During this stage, a language is unlikely to survive another generation and will soon be extinct. The fourth stage is \"moribund\", followed by the fifth stage \"extinction\".\n\nMany projects are under way aimed at preventing or slowing language loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages, often involving joint projects between language communities and linguists. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation aimed at protecting and stabilizing the language of indigenous speech communities. Recognizing that most of the world's endangered languages are unlikely to be revitalized, many linguists are also working on documenting the thousands of languages of the world about which little or nothing is known.\n\nThe total number of contemporary languages in the world is not known, and it is not well defined what constitutes a separate language as opposed to a dialect. Estimates vary depending on the extent and means of the research undertaken, and the definition of a distinct language and the current state of knowledge of remote and isolated language communities. The number of known languages varies over time as some of them become extinct and others are newly discovered. An accurate amount of languages in the world was not yet known until the use of universal, systematic surveys in the later half of the twentieth century. The majority of linguists in the early twentieth century refrained from making estimates. Before then, estimates were frequently the product of guesswork and very low.\n\nOne of the most active research agencies is SIL International, which maintains a database, Ethnologue, kept up to date by the contributions of linguists globally.\n\nEthnologue's 2005 count of languages in its database, excluding duplicates in different countries, was 6,912, of which 32.8% (2,269) were in Asia, and 30.3% (2,092) in Africa. This contemporary tally must be regarded as a variable number within a range. Areas with a particularly large number of languages that are nearing extinction include: Eastern Siberia, Central Siberia, Northern Australia, Central America, and the Northwest Pacific Plateau. Other hotspots are Oklahoma and the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nAlmost all of the study of language endangerment has been with spoken languages. A UNESCO study of endangered languages does not mention sign languages. However, some sign languages are also endangered, such as Alipur Village Sign Language (AVSL) of India, Adamorobe Sign Language of Ghana, Ban Khor Sign Language of Thailand, and Plains Indian Sign Language. Many sign languages are used by small communities; small changes in their environment (such as contact with a larger sign language or dispersal of the deaf community) can lead to the endangerment and loss of their traditional sign language. Methods are being developed to assess the vitality of sign languages.\n\nWhile there is no definite threshold for identifying a language as endangered, UNESCO's 2003 document entitled \"Language vitality and endangerment\" outlines nine factors for determining language vitality:\nMany languages, for example some in Indonesia, have tens of thousands of speakers but are endangered because children are no longer learning them, and speakers are shifting to using the national language (e.g. Indonesian) in place of local languages. In contrast, a language with only 500 speakers might be considered very much alive if it is the primary language of a community, and is the first (or only) spoken language of all children in that community.\n\nAsserting that \"Language diversity is essential to the human heritage\", UNESCO's Ad Hoc Expert Group on Endangered Languages offers this definition of an endangered language: \"... when its speakers cease to use it, use it in an increasingly reduced number of communicative domains, and cease to pass it on from one generation to the next. That is, there are no new speakers, adults or children.\"\n\nUNESCO operates with four levels of language endangerment between \"safe\" (not endangered) and \"extinct\" (no living speakers), based on intergenerational transfer: \"vulnerable\" (not spoken by children outside the home), \"definitely endangered\" (children not speaking), \"severely endangered\" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and \"critically endangered\" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often semi-speakers).\nUNESCO's \"Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger\" categorises 2,473 languages by level of endangerment. More than 200 languages have become extinct around the world over the last three generations.\n\nUsing an alternative scheme of classification, linguist Michael E. Krauss defines languages as \"safe\" if it is considered that children will probably be speaking them in 100 years; \"endangered\" if children will probably not be speaking them in 100 years (approximately 60–80% of languages fall into this category) and \"moribund\" if children are not speaking them now.\n\nMany scholars have devised techniques for determining whether languages are endangered. One of the earliest is GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) proposed by Joshua Fishman in 1991. In 2011 an entire issue of \"Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development\" was devoted to the study of ethnolinguistic vitality, Vol. 32.2, 2011, with several authors presenting their own tools for measuring language vitality. A number of other published works on measuring language vitality have been published, prepared by authors with varying situations and applications in mind.\n\nAccording to the Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages, there are four main types of causes of language endangerment:\n\nCauses that put the populations that speak the languages in physical danger, such as:\n\nCauses which prevent or discourage speakers from using a language, such as:\n\nOften multiple of these causes act at the same time. Poverty, disease and disasters often affect minority groups disproportionately, for example causing the dispersal of speaker populations and decreased survival rates for those who stay behind.\n\nAmong the causes of language endangerment cultural, political and economic marginalization accounts for most of the world's language endangerment. Scholars distinguish between several types of marginalization: Economic dominance negatively affects minority languages when poverty leads people to migrate towards the cities or to other countries, thus dispersing the speakers. Cultural dominance occurs when literature and higher education is only accessible in the majority language. Political dominance occurs when education and political activity is carried out exclusively in a majority language.\n\nHistorically, in colonies, and elsewhere where speakers of different languages have come into contact, some languages have been considered superior to others: often one language has attained a dominant position in a country. Speakers of endangered languages may themselves come to associate their language with negative values such as poverty, illiteracy and social stigma, causing them to wish to adopt the dominant language which is associated with social and economical progress and modernity. Immigrants moving into an area may lead to the endangerment of the autochthonous language.\n\nLanguage endangerment affects both the languages themselves and the people that speak them.\n\nAs communities lose their language they often also lose parts of their cultural traditions which are tied to that language, such as songs, myths and poetry that are not easily transferred to another language. This may in turn affect their sense of identity, producing a weakened social cohesion as their values and traditions are replaced with new ones. This is sometimes characterized as anomie. Losing a language may also have political consequences as some countries confer different political statuses or privileges on minority ethnic groups, often defining ethnicity in terms of language. That means that communities that lose their language may also lose political legitimacy as a community with special collective rights. Language can also be considered as scientific knowledge in topics such as medicine, philosophy, botany, and many more. It reflects a communities practices when dealing with the environment and each other. When a language is lost, this knowledge is lost as well.\n\nIn contrast, language revitalization is correlated with better health outcomes in indigenous communities.\n\nDuring language loss—sometimes referred to as \"obsolescence\" in the linguistic literature—the language that is being lost generally undergoes changes as speakers make their language more similar to the language that they are shifting to. For example, gradually losing grammatical or phonological complexities that are not found in the dominant language.\n\nGenerally the accelerated pace of language endangerment is considered to be a problem by linguists and by the speakers. However, some linguists, such as the late phonetician Peter Ladefoged, have argued that language death is a natural part of the process of human cultural development, and that languages die because communities stop speaking them for their own reasons. Ladefoged argued that linguists should simply document and describe languages scientifically, but not seek to interfere with the processes of language loss. A similar view has been argued at length by linguist Salikoko Mufwene, who sees the cycles of language death and emergence of new languages through creolization as a continuous ongoing process.\nA majority of linguists do consider that language loss is an ethical problem, as they consider that most communities would prefer to maintain their languages if given a real choice. They also consider it a scientific problem, because language loss on the scale currently taking place will mean that future linguists will only have access to a fraction of the world's linguistic diversity, therefore their picture of what human language is—and can be—will be limited.\n\nSome linguists consider linguistic diversity to be analogous to biological diversity, and compare language endangerment to wildlife endangerment.\n\nLinguists, members of endangered language communities, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations such as UNESCO and the European Union are actively working to save and stabilize endangered languages. Once a language is determined to be endangered, there are three steps that can be taken in order to stabilize or rescue the language. The first is language documentation, the second is language revitalization and the third is language maintenance.\n\nLanguage documentation is the documentation in writing and audio-visual recording of grammar, vocabulary, and oral traditions (e.g. stories, songs, religious texts) of endangered languages. It entails producing descriptive grammars, collections of texts and dictionaries of the languages, and it requires the establishment of a secure archive where the material can be stored once it is produced so that it can be accessed by future generations of speakers or scientists.\n\nLanguage revitalization is the process by which a language community through political, community, and educational means attempts to increase the number of active speakers of the endangered language. This process is also sometimes referred to as language revival or reversing language shift. Vocabulary and courses are available online for a number of endangered languages.\n\nLanguage maintenance refers to the support given to languages that need for their survival to be protected from outsiders who can ultimately affect the number of speakers of a language. UNESCO's strides towards preventing language extinction involves promoting and supporting the language in aspects such as education, culture, communication and information, and science.\n\nAnother option is \"post-vernacular maintenance\": the teaching of some words and concepts of the lost language, rather than revival proper.\n\nAs of June 2012 the United States has a \"J-1 specialist visa, which allows indigenous language experts who do not have academic training to enter the U.S. as experts aiming to share their knowledge and expand their skills\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39095", "title": "Extension (semantics)", "text": "Extension (semantics)\n\nIn any of several studies that treat the use of signs—for example, in linguistics, logic, mathematics, semantics, and semiotics—the extension of a concept, idea, or sign consists of the things to which it applies, in contrast with its comprehension or intension, which consists very roughly of the ideas, properties, or corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.\n\nIn philosophical semantics or the philosophy of language, the 'extension' of a concept or expression is the set of things it extends to, or applies to, if it is the sort of concept or expression that a single object by itself can satisfy. Concepts and expressions of this sort are monadic or \"one-place\" concepts and expressions.\n\nSo the extension of the word \"dog\" is the set of all (past, present and future) dogs in the world: the set includes Fido, Rover, Lassie, Rex, and so on. The extension of the phrase \"Wikipedia reader\" includes each person who has ever read Wikipedia, including \"you\".\n\nThe extension of a whole statement, as opposed to a word or phrase, is defined (since Frege 1892) as its truth value. So the extension of \"Lassie is famous\" is the logical value 'true', since Lassie is famous.\n\nSome concepts and expressions are such that they don't apply to objects individually, but rather serve to relate objects to objects. For example, the words \"before\" and \"after\" do not apply to objects individually—it makes no sense to say \"Jim is before\" or \"Jim is after\"—but to one thing in relation to another, as in \"The wedding is before the reception\" and \"The reception is after the wedding\". Such \"relational\" or \"polyadic\" (\"many-place\") concepts and expressions have, for their extension, the set of all sequences of objects that satisfy the concept or expression in question. So the extension of \"before\" is the set of all (ordered) pairs of objects such that the first one is before the second one.\n\nIn mathematics, the 'extension' of a mathematical concept is the set that is specified by that concept.\n\nFor example, the extension of a function is a set of ordered pairs that pair up the arguments and values of the function; in other words, the function's graph. The extension of an object in abstract algebra, such as a group, is the underlying set of the object. The extension of a set is the set itself. That a set can capture the notion of the extension of anything is the idea behind the axiom of extensionality in axiomatic set theory.\n\nThis kind of extension is used so constantly in contemporary mathematics based on set theory that it can be called an implicit assumption.\n\nIn computer science, some database textbooks use the term 'intension' to refer to the schema of a database, and 'extension' to refer to particular instances of a database.\n\nThere is an ongoing controversy in metaphysics about whether or not there are, in addition to actual, existing things, non-actual or nonexistent things. If there are—if, for instance, there are possible but non-actual dogs (dogs of some non-actual but possible species, perhaps) or nonexistent beings (like Sherlock Holmes, perhaps)—then these things might also figure in the extensions of various concepts and expressions. If not, only existing, actual things can be in the extension of a concept or expression. Note that \"actual\" may not mean the same as \"existing\". Perhaps there exist things that are merely possible, but not actual. (Maybe they exist in other universes, and these universes are other \"possible worlds\"—possible alternatives to the actual world.) Perhaps some actual things are nonexistent. (Sherlock Holmes seems to be an \"actual\" example of a fictional character; one might think there are many other characters Arthur Conan Doyle \"might\" have invented, though he actually invented Holmes.)\n\nA similar problem arises for objects that no longer exist. The extension of the term \"Socrates\", for example, seems to be a (currently) non-existent object. Free logic is one attempt to avoid some of these problems.\n\nSome fundamental formulations in the field of general semantics rely heavily on a valuation of extension over intension. See for example extension, and the extensional devices.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50897", "title": "French grammar", "text": "French grammar\n\nFrench grammar is the set of rules by which the French language creates statements, questions and commands. In many respects, it is quite similar to that of the other Romance languages.\n\nFrench is a moderately inflected language. Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); adjectives, for number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns and a few other pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for tense, aspect, mood, and the person and number of their subjects. Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions, while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs.\n\nVerbs in French are conjugated to reflect the following information:\n\nSome of these features are combined into seven tense–aspect–mood combinations. The simple (one-word) forms are commonly referred to as the present, the simple past or preterite (past tense, perfective aspect), the imperfect (past tense, imperfective aspect), the future, the conditional, the present subjunctive, and the imperfect subjunctive. However, the simple past is rarely used in informal French, and the imperfect subjunctive is rarely used in modern French at all.\n\nVerbs in the finite moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and conditional) are also conjugated to agree with their subjects in person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or plural). As in English, the subject must be included (except in the imperative mood); in other words, unlike other Romance languages, French is neither a null-subject language nor a pro-drop language.\n\nAuxiliary verbs are combined with past participles of main verbs to produce compound tenses, including the compound past \"(passé composé)\". For most main verbs the auxiliary is (the appropriate form of) \"avoir\" (\"to have\"), but for reflexive verbs and certain intransitive verbs the auxiliary is a form of \"être\" (\"to be\"). The participle agrees with the subject when the auxiliary is \"être\", and with a preceding direct object (if any) when the auxiliary is \"avoir\". Forms of \"être\" are also used with the past participles of transitive verbs to form the passive voice.\n\nThe imperative mood, which only has first-person plural and second-person singular and plural forms, usually has forms similar or identical to the corresponding ones in the present indicative.\n\nEvery French noun has a grammatical gender, either masculine or feminine. The grammatical gender of a noun referring to a human usually corresponds to the noun's natural gender (i.e., its referent's sex or gender). For such nouns, there will very often be one noun of each gender, with the choice of noun being determined by the natural gender of the person described; for example, a male singer is a \"chanteur\", while a female singer is a \"chanteuse\". A plural noun that refers to both males and females is masculine. In some cases, the two nouns are identical in form, with the difference only being marked in neighbouring words (due to gender agreement; see below); a Catholic man is \"un catholique\", while a Catholic woman is \"une catholique\". Nonetheless, there are some such nouns that retain their grammatical gender regardless of natural gender; \"personne\" 'person' is always feminine, while (at least in \"standard\" French) \"professeur\" 'teacher' is always masculine. In Canadian French, \"une professeure\" is the standard feminine form, which is becoming more and more common in European French.\n\nA noun's gender is not perfectly predictable from its form, but there are some trends. As a very broad trend, nouns ending in \"-e\" tend to be feminine, while the rest tend to be masculine. More consistently, some endings, such as \"-sion\", \"-tion\", \"-aison\" and \"-ité\" occur almost exclusively with feminine nouns, while others, such as \"-aire\" and \"-isme\" occur almost exclusively with masculine ones. Nonetheless, a noun that seems masculine judging by its ending might actually be feminine (e.g., \"la peau\" 'skin') or vice versa (e.g., \"un squelette\" 'skeleton').\n\nNoun clauses are masculine.\n\nA very small number of nouns can be used either in masculine or feminine gender with the same meaning (e.g., \"après-midi\" 'afternoon'). Often one gender is preferred over the other. Some (very rare) nouns change gender according to the way they are used: the words \"amour\" 'love' and \"délice\" 'pleasure' are masculine in singular and feminine in plural; the word \"orgue\" 'organ' is masculine, but when used emphatically in plural to refer to a church organ it becomes feminine (\"les grandes orgues\"); the plural noun \"gens\" 'people' changes gender in a very unusual way, being usually masculine but triggering feminine agreement when certain adjectives precede the word.\n\nThe vocabulary of French includes many homophones, i.e., pairs of words with different spellings but the same pronunciation. Grammatical gender, however, may serve to distinguish some of these. For example, \"le pot\" 'pot' and \"la peau\" 'skin' are both pronounced but disagree in gender.\n\nAs in English, nouns inflect for number. In terms of spelling, the plural is usually formed from the singular by adding the letter \"-s\" (cf. \"maison > maisons\" 'houses'). Nouns ending in \"-au, -eu,\" and \"-ou\" often take the ending \"-x\" instead (cf. \"jeu > jeux\" 'games'). However, the endings \"-s\" and \"-x\" are mute outside of liaison contexts, so the plural form of a noun generally has the same pronunciation as the singular. Nouns which end in \"-s, -x\" or \"-z\" in the singular are left unchanged in the plural in both pronunciation and spelling (cf. \"croix > croix\" 'crosses', both pronounced [kʁwa]).\n\nIn spoken French, therefore, the plurality of a noun generally cannot be determined from the pronunciation of the noun, but it is commonly marked by the form of a preceding article or determiner (cf. \"la maison\" [la mɛzɔ̃] 'the house' > \" les maisons\" [le mɛzɔ̃] 'the houses'; \"mon frère\" [mɔ̃ fʁɛːʁ] 'my brother' > \" mes frères\" [me fʁɛːʁ] 'my brothers').\n\nLiaison between a plural noun and a following adjective is only common in careful speech, for example, by newsreaders. In this case the plural ending \"-s\" or \"-x\" may be pronounced: \"des fenêtres ouvertes\" (\"open windows\"). In common speech this is almost never done, so singular and plural forms of most nouns are homophonous in all contexts.\n\nHowever, some French nouns have distinguishable spoken plural forms. This includes most of those ending in \"-al\", whose plural form is \"-aux\" (cf. \"cheval\" > \"chevaux\" 'horses'), as well as a few nouns ending in \"-ail\" which also follow this pattern (cf. \"travail\" [tʁavaj] > \"travaux\" [tʁavo] 'works'). Three nouns form completely irregular plurals: \"aïeul\" [ajœl] > \"aïeux\" [ajø] 'ancestors'; \"ciel\" [sjɛl] > \"cieux\" [sjø] 'heavens'; and \"œil\" [œj] > \"yeux\" [jø] 'eyes'. Three other nouns have regular plurals in spelling but have irregular pronunciations: \"bœuf\" > \"bœufs\" 'oxen, cattle'; \"œuf\" > \"œufs\" 'eggs'; and \"os\" > \"os\" 'bones'.\n\nAs with English, most uncountable nouns are grammatically treated as singular, though some are plural, such as \"les mathématiques\" 'mathematics'; some nouns that are uncountable in English are countable in French, such as \"une information\" 'a piece of information'.\n\nNouns in French are not inflected for any other grammatical categories. (However, personal pronouns are inflected for case and person; see below.)\n\nArticles and determiners agree in gender and number with the noun they determine; unlike with nouns, this inflection is made in speech as well as in writing.\n\nFrench has three articles: definite, indefinite, and partitive. The difference between the definite and indefinite articles is similar to that in English (definite: \"the\"; indefinite: \"a\", \"an\"), except that the indefinite article has a plural form (similar to \"some\", though English normally doesn't use an article before indefinite plural nouns). The partitive article is similar to the indefinite article but used for uncountable singular nouns.\n\nAn adjective must agree in gender and number with the noun it modifies. French adjectives therefore have four forms: masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine plural, and feminine plural.\n\nThe masculine singular, an adjective's basic form, is listed in dictionaries. The feminine singular is normally formed by adding \"-e\" to the basic form. This \"-e\" is mute, which makes many masculine and feminine forms homophonous (cf. \"civil > civile\" 'civil', both pronounced /sivil/). However, the ending causes \"mute\" final sounds to be pronounced, whereby masculine-feminine pairs become distinguishable in pronunciation if the masculine form ends in a mute consonant, which is the case with a great deal of adjectives (cf. \"lourd\" \"> lourde\" 'heavy'). Under certain circumstances, other minor changes occur in the formation of feminine forms, such as the placement of an accent, the doubling of a consonant, or its replacement with another, changes that often reflect the pronunciation of such endings (cf. \"bon\" [bɔ̃] > \"bonne\" [bɔn] 'good'; \"heureux\" [øʁø] > \"heureuse\" [øʁøːz] 'happy'). Irregular feminine forms include \"beau > belle\" 'beautiful', \"blanc > blanche\" 'white', and a limited number of others. If an adjective's basic form ends in \"-e\", it is left unchanged in the feminine (cf. \"riche > riche\" 'rich').\n\nThe plural is normally formed by adding \"-s\" to the singular (masculine and feminine). This \"-s\" is usually mute, but pronounced in liaison with a following noun that begins with a vowel. Unlike liaison after plural nouns, liaison after plural adjectives is common and even obligatory in standard usage. If the basic form ends in \"-s, -x\", or \"-z\", an adjective is left unchanged in the masculine plural (cf. \"doux > doux\" 'soft, gentle'). A few adjectives take the (also mute) ending \"-x\" in the masculine plural (cf. \"nouveau > nouveaux\" 'new'). Plural forms that are distinguishable from the singular outside of liaison environments occur only with adjectives ending in \"-al\". These normally have \"-aux\" in the masculine plural (cf. \"central\" \"> centraux\" 'central'). By contrast, the feminine plural is formed according to the general rule: \"centrale > centrales\".\n\nDue to the aforementioned rules, French adjectives might have four distinguished written forms which are all pronounced the same. This is the case if an adjective's masculine and feminine forms are homophonous and if there is no liaison between the adjective and a following noun.\n\nOn the other hand, if the masculine and feminine forms have different pronunciations and liaison does occur, all four forms can be distinguishable in pronunciation. Adjective declension is therefore important in spoken French, though to a lesser extent than in writing. (All forms distinguished in pronunciation are also distinguished in writing, but not vice versa.)\n\nDue to the peculiar orthography of French, which denotes mute final consonants, most feminine forms seem regular in terms of their spelling because they are formed by adding \"-e\" to the masculine form, e.g., \"grand > grande, lent > lente, persan > persane\". However, if we put this etymologic orthography aside and consider only current pronunciation, the formation of French female forms becomes quite irregular with several possible \"endings\": > , > , > .\n\nMost adjectives, when used attributively, appear after their nouns: \"le vin rouge (\"the \"red\" wine\"). A number of adjectives (often having to do with beauty, age, goodness, or size, a tendency summarized by the acronym \"BAGS\"), come before their nouns: \"une belle femme\" (\"a \"beautiful\" woman\"). With a few adjectives of the latter type, there are two masculine singular forms: one used before consonants (the basic form), and one used before vowels. For example, the adjective \"beau\" (\"beautiful\") changes form from \"un beau garçon\" (\"a \"handsome\" boy\") to \"un bel homme\" (\"a \"handsome\" man\"). Some adjectives change position depending on their meaning, sometimes preceding their nouns and sometimes following them. For example, \"ancien\" means \"former\" when it precedes its noun, but \"ancient\" when it follows it. To give another example, \"un homme grand means \"a \"tall\" man\", whereas \"un grand homme\" means \"a \"great\" man\".\n\nMany compound words contain an adjective, such as belle-mère\" \"mother-in-law\", which is distinct from belle mère\" \"beautiful mother\". Some of them use an archaic form of the feminine adjective that lacks the final \"-e\" and sometimes show an apostrophe instead of a hyphen, such as grand' route\" \"main country road\", which is distinct from grande route\" \"long way\", and grand-mère\" \"grandmother\", which is distinct from grande mère\" \"tall mother\".\n\nAs in English, adverbs in French are used to modify adjectives, other adverbs, verbs, or clauses. Most adverbs are derived from an adjective by adding the suffix \"-ment\" to its feminine form (\"-ment\" is analogous to the English suffix \"-ly\"), though some adverbs are derived irregularly and others do not derive from adjectives at all.\n\nAdverbs themselves are generally invariable. Exceptions to this are a handful of adverbs exhibiting syncretic comparative forms (e.g. \"bien\" \"well\" → \"mieux\" \"better\") and the adverb \"tout\" \"wholly, very\" which agrees in gender and number with the adjective it modifies (e.g. \"tout petit\" \"very small, m.\" → \"toute petite\" \"very small, f.\").\n\nFrench prepositions link two related parts of a sentence. In word order, they are placed in front of a noun in order to specify the relationship between the noun and the verb, adjective, or other noun that precedes it. Some common French prepositions are: \"à\" (to, at, in), \"à côté de\" (next to, beside), \"après\" (after), \"au sujet de\" (about, on the subject of), \"avant\" (before), \"avec\" (with), \"chez\" (at the home/office of, among), \"contre\" (against), \"dans\" (in), \"d'après\" (according to), \"de\" (from, of, about), \"depuis\" (since, for), \"derrière\" (in back of, behind), \"devant\" (in front of), \"durant\" (during, while), \"en\" (in, on, to), \"en dehors de\" (outside of), \"en face de\" (facing, across from), \"entre\" (between), \"envers\" (toward), \"environ\" (approximately), \"hors de\" (outside of), \"jusque\" (until, up to, even), \"loin de\" (far from), \"malgré\" (despite), \"par\" (by, through), \"parmi\" (among), \"pendant\" (during), \"pour\" (for), \"près de\" (near), \"quant à\" (as for, regarding), \"sans\" (without), \"selon\" (according to), \"sous\" (under), \"suivant\" (according to), \"sur\" (on), \"vers\" (toward).\n\nIn French pronouns can be inflected to indicate their role in a clause (subject, direct object, etc.), as well as the person, gender, and number of their referent. Not all of these inflections may be present at once; for example, the relative pronoun \"que\" (\"that\", \"which\", \"whom\") may have any referent, while the possessive pronoun \"le mien\" (\"mine\") may have any role in a clause.\n\nAs noted above, French (like English) is a non-pro-drop (\"pronoun-dropping\") language; therefore, pronouns feature prominently in the language. Impersonal verbs (e.g., \"pleuvoir\" – \"to rain\") use the impersonal pronoun \"il\" (analogous to English \"it\").\n\nFrench object pronouns are all clitics. Some appear so consistently – especially in everyday speech — that some have commented that French could almost be considered to demonstrate polypersonal agreement.\n\nFrench usually expresses negation in two parts, with the particle \"ne\" attached to the verb, and one or more negative words (connegatives) that modify the verb or one of its arguments. Negation encircles a conjugated verb with \"ne\" after the subject and the connegative after verb, if the verb is finite or a gerund. However, both parts of the negation come before the targeted verb when it is in its infinitive form. For example:\n\nOther negative words used in combination with \"ne\" are:\n\nExamples:\n\nThe negative adverbs (and \"rien\") follow finite verbs but precede infinitives (along with \"ne\"):\n\nMoreover, it is possible for \"rien\" and \"personne\" to be used as the subject of a sentence, which moves them to the beginning of the sentence (before the \"ne\"):\n\nSeveral negative words (other than \"pas\") can appear in the same sentence, but the sentence is still usually interpreted as a simple negation. When another negative word occurs with \"pas\", a double negation interpretation usually arises, but this construction is criticised.\n\nIn colloquial French, it is common to drop the \"ne\", although this can create some ambiguity with the \"ne … plus\" construction when written down, as \"plus\" could mean either \"more\" or \"not anymore\". Generally when \"plus\" is used to mean \"more\", the final \"s\" is pronounced ([plys]) whereas it is never pronounced when used to mean \"not anymore\" ([ply]).\n\nAs an example, the informal sentence \"Il y en a plus\" could be pronounced with the final [s] ([il i ɑ̃n a plys, jɑ̃n a plys]) to mean \"There is more\". Or it could be pronounced without it ([il i ɑ̃n a ply, jɑ̃n a ply]) to mean \"There is none left\".\n\nIn certain, mostly literary constructions, \"ne\" can express negation by itself (without \"pas\" or another negative word). The four verbs that can use this construction are \"pouvoir\" (\"to be able to\"), \"savoir\" (\"to know\"), \"oser\" (\"to dare\"), and \"cesser\" (\"to cease\").\n\nIn certain cases in formal French, the word \"ne\" can be used without signifying negation; the \"ne\" in such instances is known as expletive \"ne\" (French: \"ne explétif):\n\nExpletive \"ne\" is found in finite subordinate clauses (never before an infinitive). It is characteristic of literary rather than colloquial style. In other registers French tends to not use any negation at all in such clauses, e.g., \"J'ai peur que cela se reproduise\".\n\nThe following contexts allow expletive \"ne\"\n\nIn French, the equivalent of the English existential clause \"there is\" is expressed with \"il y a\", literally, \"it there has\" or \"it has to it\". The verb may be conjugated to indicate tense, but always remains in the third person singular. For example\n\nThis construction is also used to express the passage of time since an event occurred, like the English \"ago\" or \"it has been\":\n\nIn informal speech, \"il y\" is typically reduced to [j], as in:\n\nThe components of a declarative clause are typically arranged in the following order (though not all components are always present):\n\nFrench basic word order is thus subject–verb–object (\"Je lisais un livre\": I was reading a book) although, if the object is a clitic pronoun, it precedes the verb (\"Je le lisais\": I was reading it). Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular inversion of the subject and verb. For example, some adverbial expressions placed at the beginning of a sentence trigger inversion of pronominal subjects: \"Peut-être est-elle partie\" (Maybe she has left).\n\nWord order can be an indicator of stylistic register. For instance, inversion of nominal subjects is possible in many relative clauses.\nThe second version of the sentence, with inversion, is more formal.\n\n\n"}

The company was founded towards the end of 2007 by Yael Karov and Avner Zangvil. Ginger Software differentiates itself by recognizing words in the context of complete sentences. In December 2011, Ginger Software was one of nine projects approved by the Board of Governors of the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation for a funding of $8.1 million. The company also raised $3 million from private Israeli and US investors in 2009.\n\nIn May, 2014 Intel acquired one of Ginger's business units and the rights to use the company's patented technology. \n\nBefore founding Ginger Software, Yael Karov had worked with Rosetta Genomics as its Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Research and Development from 2003 to 2006, and with ClickSoftware Technologies as a Director of Research and Development from 1990 to 1994. Karov also founded Agentics, a company specializing in free-text classification of e-commerce product information based on natural language processing, in 1996. \n\nAvner Zangvil is the co-founder of Ginger Software and the husband of Yael Karov. Zangvil co-founded Menta Software in 1996 with his brother Arnon Zangvil to develop a product that transforms any Windows-based application into a Web-enabled application usable from any remote computer running a Web browser. Menta was acquired by GraphOn Corporation in 2001.\n\nGinger Software uses patented software algorithms that deal with natural language processing. The company claims that the algorithm allows it to correct the written sentences with relatively high accuracy (eliminating up to 95 percent of writing errors), compared to standard spell checkers. Its unique algorithm allows the software to understand the context of the sentence rather than correcting based solely on a word. According to its founder, Karov, the software operates on the logic of sentence context in addition to the memory of a database of words. The company is at the heart of a growing revolution in the world of assistive technology.\n\nGinger claims that the benefits of the software have been leveraged by native English and non-native speakers alike, and have also found value in niche markets like dyslexia management. They further claim that ESL users derive great benefit from the use of the software, as it lets them write error-free English text. Its use also extends to native English speaking business professionals and students who use it as a 'safety net' for their email edits, as well as international students writing in English.\n\nMore recently, the company has focused on implementing its technology in mobile devices as an integral component of its mobile keyboard products.\n\nGinger Software products include Ginger Page, a cross-platform writing enhancement app, and Ginger Keyboard which is available for Android devices.\n\nGinger Page operates as an online service and supports MS-Word, MS-Outlook, MS-PowerPoint, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox, and functions as a writing enhancement app for Android and iOS mobile devices. Its main feature is the grammar and spelling checker that runs seamlessly with the different user interfaces. It also has an advanced paraphrasing tool, contextual synonyms and definitions, multi-language translation and a text-to-speech function that enables users to hear sentences before and after correction.\n\nGinger Keyboard for Android replaces the stock keyboard and functions as a productivity boosting keyboard app. Featuring a full set of advanced keyboard features like Stream (swipe-like) typing, adaptive word prediction, a wide variety of customizable themes and emoji, Ginger Keyboard is the only 3rd party keyboard to offer proofreading and other writing tools via one tap access to Ginger Page.\n\nGinger Software started off with people with dyslexia as its primary target segment. The mathematical algorithm underlying the software studies a vast pool of proper sentences in English and builds a model of proper language. The software does not analyze the text at the level of the word, but of the whole sentence. Dyslectics can have trouble choosing the right word – hence the attention to the sentence as a whole. From 2010, Ginger Software included a new target segment in its marketing outreach – users of English as a second language (ESL). Its contextual-based writing correction tool could benefit those who are not proficient at the English language.\n\nWith the launch of Ginger Page and Ginger Keyboard, Ginger expanded its target audience to include anyone who writes in English, be they native or ESL.\n\nOriginally the company’s business model was a free 2-day trial followed by an option to purchase the user license after the trial expired. On 15 January 2012, the company changed its business model by releasing its freemium version. The freemium version consists of the contextual-based grammar and spelling checker which users could download and keep for free. The premium version was also available for purchase. Its features include Ginger Text Reader and Personal Trainer a progress report analysis tool, along with unlimited access to Grammar Checker, the grammar and spelling checker, and Sentence Rephraser the rephrasing tool.\n\nGinger Keyboard is completely free to download and use, although it does offer in-app purchases like themes and theme packs.

{"id": "1154896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154896", "title": "Hemachandra", "text": "Hemachandra\n\nAcharya Hemachandra was a Jain scholar, poet, and polymath who wrote on grammar, philosophy, prosody, and contemporary history. Noted as a prodigy by his contemporaries, he gained the title \"kalikālasarvajña\", \"the all-knowing of the Kali Yuga\".\n\nHemachandra was born in Dhandhuka, in present-day Gujarat, on Kartika Sud Purnima (the full moon day of Kartika month). His date of birth differs according to sources but 1088 is generally accepted. His father, Chachiga-deva was a Modh Bania Vaishnava. His mother, Pahini, was a Jain. Hemchandra's original given name was Changadeva. In his childhood, the Jain monk Devachandra Suri visited Dhandhuka and was impressed by the young Hemachandra's intellect. His mother and maternal uncle concurred with Devachandra, in opposition to his father, that Hemachandra be a disciple of his. Devachandra took Hemachandra to Khambhat, where Hemachandra was placed under the care of the local governor Udayana. Chachiga came to Udayana's place to take his son back, but was so overwhelmed by the kind treatment he received, that he decided to willingly leave his son with Devachandra.\n\nSome years later, Hemachandra was initiated a Jain monk on Magha Sud Chauth (4th day of the bright half of Magha month) and was given a new name, Somchandra. Udayana helped Devchandra Suri in the ceremony. He was trained in religious discourse, philosophy, logic and grammar and became well versed in Jain and non–Jain scriptures. At the age of 21, he was ordained an acharya of the Śvētāmbara school of Jainism at Nagaur in present-day Rajasthan. At this time, he was named Hemachandra Suri.\n\nAt the time, Gujarat was ruled by the Chaulukya dynasty from Anhilavada (Patan). It is not certain when Hemachandra visited Patan for the first time. As Jain monks are mendicants for eight months and stay at one place during Chaturmas, the four monsoon months, he started living at Patan during these periods and produced the majority of his works there.\n\nProbably around 1125, he was introduced to the Jayasimha Siddharaja (fl. 1092–1141) and soon rose to prominence in the Chaulukya royal court. According to the \"Prabhavaka Charita\" of Chandraprabha, the earliest biography of Hemachandra, Jayasimha spotted Hemachandra while passing through the streets of his capital. The king was impressed with an impromptu verse uttered by the young monk.\n\nIn 1135, when the Siddharaja conquered Malwa, he brought the works of Bhoja from Dhar along with other things. One day Siddhraja came across the manuscript of \"Sarasvati-Kanthabharana\" (also known as the \"Lakshana Prakash\"), a treatise on Sanskrit grammar. He was so impressed by it that he told the scholars in his court to produce a grammar that was as easy and lucid. Hemachandra requested Siddharaja to find the eight best grammatical treatises from Kashmir. He studied them and produced a new grammar work in the style of Pāṇini's \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\". He named his work \"Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāśana\" after himself and the king. Siddharaja was so pleased with the work that he ordered it to be placed on the back of an elephant and paraded through the streets of Anhilwad Patan. Hemachandra also composed the \"Dvyashraya Kavya\", an epic on the history of the Chaulukya dynasty, to illustrate his grammar.\n\nAccording to the \"Prabhachandra\", there was an incident where Siddharaja wanted to kill his nephew Kumarapala because it was prophesied that the kingdom would meet its demise at Kumarapala's hands. Hemachandra hid Kumarapala under a pile of manuscripts to save him. However, such motifs are common in Indian folk literature, so it is unlikely it was an actual historical event. Also, many sources differ on Siddharaja's motives.\n\nHemachandra became the advisor to Kumarapala. During Kumarapala's reign, Gujarat became a center of culture. Using the Jain approach of \"Anekantavada\", Hemchandra is said to have displayed a broad-minded attitude, which pleased Kumarapala. Kumarapala was a Shaiva and ordered the rebuilding of Somnath at Prabhas Patan. Some people who were jealous of Hemachandra's rising popularity with the Kumarapala complained that Hemachandra was a very arrogant person, that he did not respect the devas and that he refused to bow down to Shiva. When called upon to visit the temple on the inauguration with Kumarapala, Hemachandra readily bowed before the lingam but said: Ultimately, the king became a devoted follower of Hemachandra and a champion of Jainism.\n\nStarting in 1121, Hemachandra was involved in the construction of the Jain temple at Taranga. His influence on Kumarapala resulted in Jainism becoming the official religion of Gujarat and animal slaughter was banned in the state. The tradition of animal sacrifice in the name of religion was completely uprooted in Gujarat. As a result, even almost 900 years after Hemchandra, Gujarat still continues to be a predominantly lacto-vegetarian state, despite having an extensive coastline.\n\nHe announced about his death six months in advance and fasted in his last days, a Jain practice called \"sallekhana\". He died at Anhilavad Patan. The year of death differs according to sources but 1173 is generally accepted.\n\nA prodigious writer, Hemachandra wrote grammars of Sanskrit and Prakrit, poetry, prosody, lexicons, texts on science and logic and many branches of Indian philosophy. It is said that Hemachandra composed 3.5 crore verses in total, many of which are now lost.\n\nHis systematic exposition of the Jain path in the Yogaśāstra and its auto-commentary is a very influential text in Jain thought. According to Olle Quarnström it is \"the most comprehensive treatise on Svetambara Jainism known to us\".\n\nThis Sanskrit grammar was written in the style of Pāṇini. It has seven chapters with each chapter having four sections, similar to that of the grammar of Bhoja. The \"Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāśana\" also includes six Prakrit languages: the \"standard\" Prakrit (virtually Maharashtri Prakrit), Shauraseni, Magahi, Paiśācī, the otherwise-unattested Cūlikāpaiśācī and Apabhraṃśa (virtually Gurjar Apabhraṃśa, prevalent in the area of Gujarat and Rajasthan at that time and the precursor of Gujarati language). He gave a detailed grammar of Apabhraṃśa and also illustrated it with the folk literature of the time for better understanding. It is the only known Apabhraṃśa grammar.\n\nTo illustrate the grammar, he produced the epic poetry \"Dvyashraya Kavya\" on the history of Chaulukya dynasty. It is an important source of history of region of the time.\n\nThe epic poem \"Trīṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacharitra\" or \"Lives of Sixty-Three Great Men\" is a hagiographical treatment of the twenty four tirthankaras and other important persons instrumental in defining the Jain philosophical position, collectively called the \"śalākāpuruṣa\", their asceticism and eventual liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth, as well as the legendary spread of the Jain influence. It still serves as the standard synthesis of source material for the early history of Jainism. The appendix to this work, the \"Pariśiṣṭaparvan\" or \"Sthavirāvalīcarita\", contains his own commentary and is in itself a treatise of considerable depth It has been translated into English as \"The Lives of the Jain Elders\".\n\nHis \"Kavyanuprakasha\" follows the model of Kashmiri rhetorician Mammata's \"Kavya-prakasha\". He quoted other scholars like Anandavardhana and Abhinavagupta in his works.\n\n\"Abhidhan-Chintamani\" (IAST abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi-kośa) is a lexicon while \"Anekarth Kosha\" is a lexicon of words bearing multiple meanings. \"Deshi-Shabda-Sangraho\" or \"Desi-nama-mala\" is the lexicon of local or non-Sanskrit origin. \"Niganthu Sesa\" is a botanical lexicon.\n\nHe composed the \"Chandonushasana\", a work on prosody, with commentary.\n\nHemachandra, following the earlier Gopala, described Fibonacci sequence before Fibonacci. The work was presented around 1150, about fifty years before Fibonacci (1202).

{"id": "15584148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15584148", "title": "Japanese script reform", "text": "Japanese script reform\n\nThe Japanese script reform is the attempt to correlate standard spoken Japanese with the written word, which began during the Meiji period. This issue is known in Japan as the . The reforms led to the development of the modern Japanese written language, and explain the arguments for official policies used to determine the usage and teaching of kanji rarely used in Japan.\n\nA misconception is held that Japanese script reform originated from the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers during the Occupation of Japan, but in fact, a plan had already been put into place prior to the occupation. Reform efforts date back to at least 1900, and proposals to reform kanji usage had been developed in the 1920s.\n\nIn the 1900 spelling reforms, hentaigana (old variant forms of kana) were eliminated, though historical kana orthography (dating to the Heian period, a millennium before) was retained. A separate character for ん was also prescribed; previously it had been written as む ('mu') and ん was a hentaigana for both these sounds. A proposal to eliminate certain kanji from use was implemented in a number of regions and overseas territories in the 1920s, near the end of the Taishō period.\n\nIn November 1922, the , the precursor to the Japanese Language Council, now the Japanese Language subdivision of the Agency for Cultural Affairs, selected and approved a list of 1,962 kanji characters for daily use. This group of characters formed the basis for the \"tōyō kanji\" list, which eventually developed into the modern \"jōyō kanji\" list. In December 1923, the committee approved a set of reforms for kana usage; the prototype for the modern kana system.\n\nThe reforms made after the Second World War have had a particularly significant impact on accepted kanji usage in the modern Japanese language.\n\nOn 12 November 1945, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper published an editorial concerning the abolition of kanji, and on 31 March 1946, the first American Education Delegation arrived in Japan at the invitation of the SCAP and issued its first report. The report pointed out the difficulties concerning kanji use, and advocated the use of rōmaji, which they considered more convenient. As a result, the gradual abolition of kanji became official policy for the SCAP, and the \"tōyō kanji\" list and modern kana usage proposals were drawn up in accordance with this policy.\n\nThe \"tōyō kanji\" list, containing 1850 characters, was published by the cabinet on 16 November 1946 with the intention of completely abolishing the use of kanji in the future. The list reduced the number of kanji deemed appropriate for daily use, and categorized certain kanji for specific use in official publications and documents.\n\nPrior to this reform, an attempt had already been made to simplify several older complex kanji, the \"kyūjitai\", with new simpler variants, the \"shinjitai\", but was not conducted with a systematic simplification of elements and radicals the way China would develop its simplified writing system a decade later, though some \"shinjitai kanji\" have even served as the basis for several simplified Chinese characters. In Japan, changes were only made to complex characters that needed to be abbreviated.\n\nAnother separate attempt was made to limit the number of kanji readings, but the first list proved much too restrictive. For instance, the character had its readings limited to \"gyo\" and \"uo\" when the most common reading, \"sakana,\" was not officially recognized by the list. These shortcomings were acknowledged in the revised list of \"tōyō kanji,\" published on 28 June 1972.\n\nOn 5 July 1956, the Japanese Language Council announced a list of substitute characters for words that contained characters not on the official list in an effort to ease the implementation of \"tōyō kanji\". This use of alternative, common kanji in place of rarer ones was called .\n\nDifferent spellings for words were unified using characters from the \"tōyō kanji\" list. The list below shows some examples, with the non-\"tōyō kanji\" placed in brackets.\n\n\nJargon and other specialized words that could be written in more than one way were generally written using characters from the list.\n\nOther words that used kanji that were not included in the list were given phonetic substitutes.\n\nFor kanji compounds with characters that could not be reasonably substituted, the recommendation was to write the \"missing\" kanji in kana instead, a practice known as .\n\nHowever, the recent prevalence of computers has made it easier for Japanese speakers to identify and use rarer characters, and the idea of having a list of approved characters has come under reconsideration. The Japanese media has increasingly used non-approved kanji with furigana to aid the reader in place of \"mazegaki\".\n\nOn 16 February 1948, 881 of the \"tōyō kanji\" were designated to be taught during primary education, and became known as the \"kyōiku kanji\" (education kanji).\n\nIn the same year, Article 50 of the family register law made it illegal to name a child using characters not on the official list. When this law first came into effect, the Ministry of Justice declared that all newborn babies must be registered in the \"koseki\" (the Japanese family registry) with a name that used only hiragana, katakana or \"tōyō kanji\". However, in 1951, an additional 92 characters were approved by the government as \"jinmeiyō kanji\"; kanji acceptable for use in names. This list was modified in 1997 to increase to a total of 285 characters. At the time, eight characters from the original \"jinmeiyō kanji\" list were added to the \"jōyō kanji\" (daily use) list, and were removed from the group of \"jinmeiyō kanji\".\n\nOn 27 September 2004, another 488 kanji were approved for use in names, partly as a result of the ruling by the Sapporo High Court that it was unacceptable for so many common characters to be excluded from use in names simply because they were not part of the official list. 578 characters were initially added, though some characters unsuitable for names such as 怨 (grudge, resent), 痔 (haemorrhoids) and 屍 (corpse) were removed as a result of public feedback.\n\nThe \"tōyō kanji\" list, which was created as a step towards the abolition of kanji, has undergone frequent criticism by scholars. In 1958, Tsuneari Fukuda wrote an article in the magazine \"Koe\" pointing out that it was impossible to restrict kanji use, and in 1961, several prominent anti-reformists walked out of the Japanese Language Council general meeting in protest of the dominance of the phoneticists, who were always re-elected to their positions on the council.\n\nThe following year, Japanese Language Council member Tomizō Yoshida argued that the council should base their reforms on standardising the current writing system using a mixture of kanji and kana, and in 1965, Morito Tatsuo, the then chairman of the council, announced that the complete abolition of kanji was now inconceivable and that Yoshida's suggestion would become official policy.\n\nOn 16 November 1946, historical kana usage underwent official reform to reflect modern pronunciation as . In addition, two kana, ゐ/ヰ \"wi\" and ゑ/ヱ \"we\", were officially declared obsolete, as the pronunciations they represented had dropped from the language many centuries before.\n\nSome reformers wished to eliminate kanji altogether, and have a phonetic written language only using kana, but this was decided against, and further reforms were halted.\n\nModern kana usage still has one or two incongruities, as reform was halted at an intermediate stage. On 1 July 1985, the government confirmed that no further reforms would be made in the near future.\n\n\nWhen reporting the lawsuits against Minamata disease in 1970, the non-tōyō kanji 怨 \"on\", \"grudge\", was used to refer to the feelings of the bereaved families. As a result of this widespread coverage, this kanji was reintroduced into popular usage, which opened the door for many more kanji to be rehabilitated.\n\nThe \"jōyō kanji\" list, consisting at that time of 1945 characters, was published by the Japanese government in 1981 to serve as a replacement for the \"tōyō kanji\" list. This newer list was based on the older \"tōyō kanji\" list, though \"jōyō kanji\" was more of a guide to kanji usage while \"tōyō kanji\" was created to gradually eliminate kanji usage.\n\nAround the same time, the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JIS) also attempted to create a standardised kanji character set for use in computing and word processing, and to assign a unique character code to each kanji for data processing. This character set was, like the \"jōyō kanji\", merely a subset of the thousands of documented kanji, and became known colloquially as the JIS kanji set. The character set has undergone several revisions since its inception. The first of these, officially known as JIS C 6226, or more commonly as the old JIS kanji set, was published in 1978 and contained 6802 characters. After the creation of the \"jōyō kanji\" list in 1983, the old set was expanded to contain 6877 characters, including some non-kanji characters. This is known as the new JIS kanji set, and was designated as JIS X 0208 in 1987.\n\nApproximately 200 characters were changed from their traditional form to their simplified form in the change from the old JIS to the new JIS set, meaning that word documents written on computers using the old character set would not display the same characters when displayed on a computer that used the new character set.\n\nThe JIS character set makes no distinction between the forms of characters, so it is not possible to distinguish between traditional and simplified forms. However, some characters, such as 剣, 劒, and 劍, are distinguished within the character set, despite being variations of the same character.\n\nIncreased use of kana to kanji conversion on word processors and computers during the mid-1980s brought drastic changes to the amount of Japanese written by hand. As a result, the use of kanji outside the \"jōyō kanji\" increased, reversing the prior trend of using fewer kanji. These characters were called \"gaiji\" (lit. \"outside characters\")\n\nThe preface to the Japanese Language Council internal report on the \"jōyō kanji\" states that the council's decision on the forms of characters not on the approved list is pending, and will await research from each field. The new JIS character set extends kanji simplification to \"gaiji\", creating a discrepancy between the standard forms of characters used in literature and materials produced on a computer or word processor. There is pressure for the Japanese publishing industry to adopt the new JIS character set abbreviations, and the resulting variation in \"gaiji\" led the Japanese Language Council, in their final report in December 2000, to produce a list of standard forms for many of these kanji to be used as a guideline. This list is called the in Japan.\n\nThis list was compiled by researching the various gaiji forms used in printed materials, and 1022 major characters were given standard forms to be used in print type face. 22 of these characters were simplified common forms, and the abbreviated forms of three radicals were acknowledged as permissible alternatives for these characters. However, the general policy of the list was to use traditional forms for all gaiji.\n\nThough newspaper publishers had been firm advocates for reducing the number of kanji, the release of the \"gaiji\" list forced them to reduce \"mazegaki\" in newspaper print. Subsequent issues of the tended to increase the number of permissible characters, so that former \"mazegaki\" words could be written as kanji (for example, the use of \"拉致\" in place of \"ら致\" or \"危惧\" in place of \"危ぐ\"). As newspapers began to use computerised typesetting, some newspapers reintroduced ruby characters to indicate the reading of uncommon kanji. Though not a unified movement, there was a general trend towards increased kanji use. Other mass media organizations followed suit, and the also reduced the amount of \"mazegaki\" used.\n\nThere were substantial discrepancies between the \"gaiji\" list and JIS forms, but these discrepancies were corrected in 2004 with the release of JIS X 0213, which brought the JIS in line with the Japanese Language Council. The changes in jinmeiyō kanji made by the Ministry of Justice during the same year also conformed to this standard printed form, with 芦 being an exception. Computers have also moved towards a standard form following the printed character forms. However, JIS X 0213 subsumes personal place names and other proper nouns that were excluded from the \"gaiji\" list, so confusion may still result for characters like 辻, where the character form differs between the printed standard and naming standard.\n\n\"Jōyō kanji\" and \"jinmeiyō kanji\" (list as of 2000) were not included on the \"gaiji\" list, so the standards for those characters are the forms used in the jinmeiyō kanji list. Similarly, 曙 and 蓮, which were added to the jinmeiyō kanji list in 1990, remain the standards forms for the same reason, even though traditional forms exist for those characters (a dot in the middle of 者 for 曙, and a double-dotted radical for 蓮). These kanji remained unchanged in the alterations made to the list in 2004. On the other hand, the characters 堵 and 逢, which were added to the jinmeiyō kanji list in 2004, do have a standard printed form with a dot in the middle of 者 and two dots on the radical, and were amended accordingly in JIS X 0213.\n\nThe use of kanji as part of Japanese orthography has been a matter of debate since at least the end of the Edo period. The use of kanji has been criticised for various reasons, the main criticisms being:\n\nThese criticisms led to arguments that reduction or eradication of kanji was a matter of national interest. The idea of abolishing kanji is often referenced to Maejima Hisoka's report titled , which was submitted to the \"shōgun\" Tokugawa Yoshinobu in 1866. The report argued that kanji should be abolished because the process of learning kanji was inefficient; however, in recent years the existence of this report has come into question, and further investigation was made into the subject in a graduation thesis for the department of literary history at Risshō University in 1999. Other advocates of kanji reform include the following:\n\n\nThe romaji issue is still occasionally pushed by fringe writers, for example the 2011 book by Katsuhiko Tanaka ().\n\nCurrent opinion favors the inclusion of the character 碍 under the Jōyō Kanji list in order to promote the more positive word for handicapped person, 障碍者, because the current word for handicapped, 障害者, uses the character 害, which has a secondary derogatory meaning of \"harm or evil influence\".\n\nThe current issue of \"mazegaki,\" mixing kanji and kana to write a single word, originated with the modern reforms, particularly the introduction of the \"tōyō kanji\" list. Though the intention was to have words requiring characters that were not included on the list to be substituted with a suitable synonym, in reality, the rule was circumvented by writing these kanji in kana and making \"mazegaki\" commonplace. One of the most commonly seen examples is 宝くじ (\"takara-kuji\" lottery), which is traditionally written 宝籤. Foods commonly written either just in kana or in mazegaki include 醤油／しょう油 (\"shōyu\" soya sauce) and 味噌 (\"miso\"). Other words commonly written as \"mazegaki\" include 改ざん, 破たん, 隠ぺい, 漏えい, 覚せい剤, and 団らん where the traditional forms are 改竄, 破綻, 隠蔽, 漏洩, 覚醒剤, and 団欒 respectively. Note that in some cases the unused kanji is very complicated (欒 has 23 strokes), while in other cases the character may be relatively simple but not on the official list (e.g. 洩 has only 9 strokes). This is also common for medical terms, which often use rare kanji, as in 骨粗しょう症 for 骨粗鬆症.\n\n\"Mazegaki\" is not enforced and is rarely used in literature, where traditional forms are often used, although it is common in media outlets such as newspapers and television broadcasts, since non-Jōyō kanji are not supposed to be used in these contexts. In extreme cases, \"jōyō kanji\" may be written in this way in television programmes or manga aimed at younger children or language learners – for example 友達 (\"tomodachi\" \"friend\") may be written as 友だち. \"Mazegaki\" may also be used in signs, possibly as katakana – for example, 皮膚科 (\"hifuka\" dermatologist) may be written as 皮フ科 to improve legibility from a distance.\n\nAt the time of the introduction of the \"tōyō kanji\" list, the use of ruby characters, also known as furigana, led to high printing costs for newspaper companies due to difficulties in typesetting, and \"mazegaki\" eliminated the need for furigana. The resulting reduction in printing costs gave the restriction or abolition of kanji serious economic advantages for newspaper companies, and they became heavily involved in decisions made by the Japanese Language Council.\n\nThe use of common kanji in place of uncommon ones with the same reading is known as \"kakikae\" (\"changed writing\"). One of the most common examples is the use of 才 instead of 歳, both pronounced \"sai,\" when writing ages, as in 10才 rather than 10歳. Another common example is 抽籤 \"chūsen\" (lottery), which is often written as 抽選, in addition to the mazegaki 抽せん mentioned above. A rarer example is the word 沈澱 \"chinden\" 'settlement (of sediment)', which is a combination of the characters 沈 'to sink' and 澱 'sediment', so the meaning is evident from the kanji. However, in modern writing the uncommon character 澱 has been substituted with 殿 'Mr, lord' (omitting the 3-stroke water radical on the left), a similar character with the same pronunciation but a different meaning, yielding the combination 沈殿, which could now be construed to mean 'sinking lord'.\n\nVarious hybrid simplifications also exist, using simpler non-standard characters. This is generally used in handwriting instead of print, and these characters are known as \"ryakuji\" (\"abbreviated characters\"). For example, replacing 闘 with 斗, both pronounced \"to,\" is \"kakikae,\" as these are both standard characters, but replacing 闘 with the non-standard character 閗 (門斗: 斗 contained in 門) is a \"ryakuji\".\n\nAdvocates of the method explain that it makes content easier to read and will attract a wider audience, while critics argue that it is sloppy and erodes traditional culture. Further, mazegaki is criticized because in some respects it makes the text more difficult to read, as it is not clear that the hiragana are part of a content word, and not okurigana or performing a grammatical function (inflection or particles).\n\nAs they are phonetic substitutions, one of the problems with using \"mazegaki\" and \"kakikae\" is that the original meaning of the word is not clear from the characters. Kanji have both sound and meaning, and most compounds are created by combining both (ateji use only sound, however). For example, the 破 of 破たん \"hatan\" means 'rip', but the たん is kana \"tan\" and does not carry any meaning. Furthermore, \"mazegaki\" may cause problems in discerning the intended reading; for example, the word 真摯 \"shinshi\" (\"sincerity\"), when written as 真し, may be misconstrued as *\"mashi\" or *\"masashi\", causing momentary confusion.\n\nAlthough there are some examples where \"kakikae\" uses a simpler character with a similar or related meaning and is generally not criticized, for the most part the substitutions have been purely phonetic and the practices of \"mazegaki\" and \"kakikae\" have been criticised for legitimising sloppy Japanese and eroding part of Japanese culture.\n\nIn 2005, Microsoft announced that the fonts Meiryo, MS Gothic, and MS Mincho in the Windows Vista operating system would comply with JIS X 0213:2004. Though this removed incompatibilities with the accepted \"gaiji\" forms in the Windows environment, it did raise concerns that the characters would be displayed differently depending on the version of Windows system used, re-creating the problems that occurred in the shift from the old to new JIS character set. Microsoft allayed these fears by announcing that the standard Japanese fonts on Vista would be OpenType compatible, and old character forms could also be used by converting between variant forms. In actuality, the Adobe Systems applications InDesign, Illustrator and the JustSystems application Ichitaro allow conversion of variant forms in software that have full support for OpenType. However, there are few other applications released for Windows Vista that support OpenType, and Office 2007 does not support conversion of variant kanji forms.\n\n\n\n"}

Nkafa is well understood by all and is widely spoken, being the main language of administration and commerce, and having a literary tradition. It is natively spoken by the clans of Kwache, Kwaga, Kwabe, Kwaya and Kwaghe. The other Nkafa clans are Kwaha and Kwabuggi.

Kwada Kwakaa was said to be a warrior hunter who could hunt lions and leopards just by himself.

{"id": "667884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=667884", "title": "Literacy test", "text": "Literacy test\n\nA literacy test assesses a person's literacy skills: their ability to read and write. Literacy tests have been administered by various governments to immigrants. In the United States, between the 1850s and 1960s, literacy tests were administered to prospective voters, and this had the effect of disenfranchising African Americans and others.\n\nFrom the 1890s to the 1960s, many state governments in the United States administered literacy tests to prospective voters purportedly to test their literacy in order to vote. In practice, these tests were intended to disenfranchise racial minorities. Southern state legislatures employed literacy tests as part of the voter registration process starting in the late 19th century. Literacy tests, along with poll taxes, residency and property restrictions and extra-legal activities (violence, intimidation) were all used to deny suffrage to African Americans. The first formal voter literacy tests were introduced in 1890. At first, whites were generally exempted from the literacy test if they could meet alternate requirements that in practice excluded blacks, such as a grandfather clause or a finding of \"good moral character\"\n\nIn \"Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections\" (1959), the U.S. Supreme Court held that literacy tests were not necessarily violations of Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor of the Fifteenth Amendment. Southern states abandoned the literacy test only when forced to do so by federal legislation in the 1960s. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided that literacy tests used as a qualification for voting in federal elections be administered wholly in writing and only to persons who had completed six years of formal education.\n\nIn part to curtail the use of literacy tests, Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Act prohibited jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attained a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico. The Supreme Court upheld this provision in \"Katzenbach v. Morgan\" (1966). Although the Court had earlier held in \"Lassiter\" that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in \"Morgan\" the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such as the right to vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional.\n\nAs originally enacted, the Voting Rights Act also suspended the use of literacy tests in all jurisdictions in which less than 50% of voting-age residents were registered as of November 1, 1964, or had voted in the 1964 presidential election. In 1970, Congress amended the Act and expanded the ban on literacy tests to the entire country. The Supreme Court then upheld the ban as constitutional in \"Oregon v. Mitchell\" (1970), but just for federal elections. The Court was deeply divided in this case, and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.\n\nThe literacy test was a device to restrict the total number of immigrants while not offending the large element of ethnic voters. The \"old\" immigration (British, Irish, German, Scandinavian) had fallen off and was replaced by a \"new\" immigration from Italy, Russia and other points in Southern and eastern Europe. The \"old\" immigrants were voters and strongly approved of restricting the \"new\" immigrants. All groups of American voters strongly opposed Chinese and Asian immigration. The 1896 Republican platform called for a literacy test.\n\nThe American Federation of Labor took the lead in promoting literacy tests that would exclude illiterate immigrants, primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe. A majority of the labor union membership were immigrants or sons of immigrants from Germany, Scandinavia and Britain, but the literacy test would not hinder immigration from those countries.\n\nCorporate industry however, needed new workers for its mines and factories and opposed any restrictions on immigration. In 1906, the House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon, a conservative Republican, worked aggressively to defeat a proposed literacy test for immigrants. A product of the western frontier, Cannon felt that moral probity was the only acceptable test for the quality of an immigrant. He worked with Secretary of State Elihu Root and President Theodore Roosevelt to set up the \"Dillingham Commission,\" a blue ribbon body of experts that produced a 41-volume study of immigration. The Commission recommended a literacy test and the possibility of annual quotas. Presidents Cleveland and Taft vetoed literacy tests in 1897 and 1913.

It is also the first language of nearly 10,000 people on the island of Minicoy in the Union territory of Lakshadweep, India, where the Mahl dialect of the Maldivian language is spoken.\n\nMaldivian is closely related to the Sinhalese language of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe ethnic autonym for the language, \"Divehi\", is occasionally found in English as \"Dhivehi\" (spelled according to the locally used Malé Latin for romanization of the Maldivian language), which is the official spelling as well as the common usage in the Maldives. Maldivian is written in the Thaana script.\n\nThe major dialects of Maldivian are \"Malé\", \"Huvadhu\", \"Mulaku\", \"Addu\", \"Haddhunmathee\", and \"Maliku\". The standard form of Maldivian is Malé, which is spoken in the Maldivian capital of the same name. The Maliku dialect spoken in Minicoy is officially referred to as \"Mahl\" by the Lakshadweep administration. This has been adopted by many authors when referring to Maldivian spoken in Minicoy.\n\nMaldivian is a descendent of Elu Prakrit and is closely related to the Sinhalese language, but not mutually intelligible with it. Many languages have influenced the development of the Maldivian language through the ages, most importantly Arabic. Others include French, Persian, Portuguese, Hindustani, and English. The English words \"atoll\" (a ring of coral islands or reefs) and \"dhoni\" (a vessel for inter-atoll navigation) are anglicised forms of the Maldivian words ' and '.\n\nThe origin of the word \"Divehi\" is \"Div\"+\"vehi\" meaning \"Islanders\" (from Sanskrit Dvīpa). \"Bas\" means \"language\" (from Sanskrit Bhāṣā), so \"\" means \"Islanders' language\". Harry Charles Purvis Bell, one of the first Dhivehi linguists, called it \"Divehi\". This was consistent with \"Maldives\", the name of the country, for the \"-dives\" of \"Maldives\" and the word \"Divehi\" have the same root, Old Indo-Aryan \"dvīpa\" \"island\".\n\nWilhelm Geiger, a German linguist who undertook the first research on Maldivian linguistics in the early 20th century, also called the language \"Divehi\". An \"h\" was added to the name of the language— \"Dhivehi\"— in 1976, when the semi-official transliteration called Malé Latin was developed. Today the spelling with an \"h\" is both common and official usage in the Maldives.\n\nMaldivian is an Indo-Aryan language closely related to the Sinhalese language of Sri Lanka. Maldivian represents the southernmost Indo-Aryan language. Together with Sinhala, Maldivian represents a subgroup within the Modern Indo-Aryan languages which is called Insular Indo-Aryan. However, Sinhala and Maldivian are not mutually intelligible.\n\nMaldivian is descended from the Maharashtri Prakrit of ancient and medieval India. These Prakrits were originally derived from Old Indo-Aryan vernaculars related to Vedic Sanskrit.\n\nWhereas earlier it was believed that Maldivian was a descendant of the Sinhalese language, in 1969 Sinhalese philologist M. W. S. de Silva for the first time proposed that Maldivian and Sinhalese have branched off from a common mother language.\n\nMaldivian has a continuous written history of about eight hundred years. The earliest writings were on the \" (copper-plate grants) of the 12th and 13th centuries. Early inscriptions on coral stone have also been found. The oldest inscription found to date is an inscription on a coral stone, which is estimated to be from around the 7th or 8th century.\n\nMaldivian is an Indo-Aryan language of the Sinhalese-Maldivian subfamily. It developed in relative isolation from other languages until the 12th century. Since the 16th century, Maldivian has been written in a unique script called Thaana which is written from right to left, like those of Aramaic and Arabic (with which it shares several common diacritics for vowel sounds).\n\nThe foundation of the historical linguistic analysis of both Maldivian and Sinhalese was laid by Wilhelm Geiger (1856–1943). In Geiger's comparative study of Maldivian and Sinhalese, he assumes that Maldivian is a dialectal offspring of Sinhalese and therefore is a \"daughter language\" of Sinhalese. However, the material he collected was not sufficient to judge the \"degree of relationship\" of Maldivian and Sinhalese.\n\nGeiger concludes that Maldivian must have split from Sinhalese not earlier that the 10th century CE. However, there is nothing in the history of these islands or Sinhalese chronicles, even in legendary form, that alludes to a migration of Sinhalese people which results such a connection.\n\nVitharana suggests that Maldivian did not evolve as a separate language to Sinhalese until the 12th century CE. But Reynolds and others have suggested that Maldivian started showing indications of divergence as early as the 4th century CE.\n\nDe Silva proposes that Maldivian and Sinhalese must have branched off from a common mother language. He says that \"the earliest Indic element in Maldivian is not so much a result of branching off from Sinhalese as a result of a simultaneous separation with Sinhalese from the Indic languages of the mainland of India\", referring to Dravidian influences seen in the Maldivian language, such as in old place names.\n\nDe Silva's theory is supported by the legend of Prince Vijaya as told in the \"Mahavamsa\", because if this legend is to be believed, the migration of Indo-Aryan colonists to the Minicoy, Maldives and Sri Lanka from the mainland (India) must have taken place simultaneously. This means that Maldivian and Sinhalese must be \"sister languages\" that developed from a common Prakrit.\n\nWhatever the origin of Maldivian, linguists agree that Maldivian is an Indo-Aryan language which also has older Indic elements in it.\n\nA rare Maliku Thaana primer written in Maldivian published by Lakshadweep's administration during the time of Rajiv Gandhi's rule was reprinted by Spanish researcher Xavier Romero-Frias in 2003.\n\nThere is a holiday, the \"Dhivehi Language Day\", which is celebrated in the Maldives on 14 April, the birthday of the writer Husain Salaahuddin.\n\nMost speakers of Maldivian live in the Maldives, where it is the national language of the island-nation. Maldivian is also spoken in Minicoy Island in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, India, while a few have migrated to Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and elsewhere in the state of Kerala.\n\nMaldivian is the official language of Maldives and a semi-official language in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, India.\n\nDue to the wide distribution of the islands, differences in pronunciation and vocabulary have developed during the centuries. The mainstream form of Maldivian is known as \"Malé Bas\" and is based on the dialect spoken in the capital of the Maldives.\n\nThe most divergent dialects of the language are to be found in the southern atolls, namely Huvadhu, Fuvahmulah and Addu. Slighter variants are spoken in Haddhunmathi and in Minicoy (Maliku) where \"Haddhunmathee Bas\" and \"Maliku Bas\" (\"Mahl\") are spoken respectively. The dialect spoken in Minicoy has fewer differences from the standard Maldivian than other dialects. Among the dialects, \"Malé Bas\" and \"Maliku Bas\" are most similar. The other variants show much difference including the dialects spoken in a few islands in Kolhumadulu, which are hardly recognised and known.\n\n\"Mulaku Bas\" is a dialect of Maldivian spoken by the people of Fuvahmulah. \"Mulaku Bas\" has word-final 'l' (\"laamu sukun\" ), which is absent from the other dialects of Maldivian. Another characteristic is the 'o' sound at the end of words, instead of the final 'u' common in all other forms of Maldivian; e.g. 'fanno' instead of 'fannu'. Regarding pronunciation, the retroflex 'ṣ' (IPA [ʂ]), which has almost a slight 'r' sound in mainstream Maldivian, becomes 'š' (IPA [ʃ]) in \"Mulaku Bas\", sounding like \"shīn\". One of the most unusual features of \"Mulaku Bas\" is that, unlike other dialects, it distinguishes gender. Also, there are many remarkable differences in the dialect in place of the \"Sukun\" system as well as the vowel or diacritical system following a distinctive set of rules.\n\n\"Huvadhu Bas\", spoken by the inhabitants of the large atoll of Huvadhu, is another distinctive form of Maldivian. Because of the isolation from the Northern Atolls, and the capital of Malé, \"Huvadhu Bas\" compared to other variants makes more use of the retroflex /ʈ/. \"Huvadhu Bas\" also retains old Sinhala words and is sometimes considered to be linguistically closer to Sinhala than the other dialects of Maldivian.\n\n\"Addu Bas\" is also quite different from the official form of the Maldivian language and has some affinities with \"Mulaku Bas\". In the past, Addu Atoll being a centre of Education, the islanders from the three atolls of the south who acquired education from the atoll used the \"Addu Bas\" as their lingua franca. Hence, when for example one of these islanders of any of the Huvadhu islands met with someone from Fuvahmulah, they would use \"Addu Bas\" to talk to each other. \"Addu Bas\" is the most widespread of the dialects of Maldivian. However, the secessionist government of the Suvadives (1959–1963) used \"Malé Bas\" in its official correspondence.\n\nThe lesser known dialect in the Madifushi island of Kolhumadulu locally known as \"Madifushi Bas\" has some similarities with \"Huvadhu Bas\". Word-final 'a' is often replaced with 'e' or 'o', and some final consonants also differ.\n\nThe letter Ṇaviyani (different from the letter Ñaviyani), which represented the retroflex \"n\" sound common to many Indic languages (Gujarati, Hindi, etc.), was abolished from official documents in 1950 by Muhammad Amin, the ruler of Maldives. It is not known why this particular letter representing a retroflex sound was abolished while others, like Ḷaviyani, Ḍaviyani, and Ṭaviyani, were not. Ṇaviyani's former position in the Thaana alphabet, between the letters Gaafu and Seenu, is today occupied by the palatal nasal Ñ or Ñyaviyani ޏ. It is still seen in reprints of traditional old books like the \"Bodu Tarutheebu\" and official documents like \"Rādavaḷi\". It is also used by people of southern atolls when writing songs or poetry in their language variant.\n\nAccording to Sonja Fritz, \"the dialects of Maldivian represent different diachronial stages in the development of the language. Especially in the field of morphology, the amount of archaic features steadily increase from the north to the south. Within the three southernmost atolls (of the Maldives), the dialect of the Addu islands which form the southern tip of the whole archipelago is characterized by the highest degree of archaicity\".\n\nFritz puts forward this theory based on research into the dialects of Addu and Fuvahmulah. She is yet to do research on the dialect of Huvadhu Atoll, and has to do more research on both Addu and Fuvahmulah dialect. Only then can she determine whether the dialects Fuvahmulah and Huvadhu or that of Addu is more archaic. However, from Malé (Maldives) to the south up to Huvadhu Atoll (Maldives) the amount of archaic features increase but from Huvadhu Atoll the amount of archaic features decrease towards south. And the dialect of Huvadhu is characterized by the highest degree of archaicity.\n\nFritz also adds that \"the different classes of verb conjugation and nominal inflection are best preserved there, morphological simplifications and, as a consequence increasing from atoll to atoll towards north (in the Maldives)\".\n\nMaldivian presents another aspect with which English speakers are not too familiar: the distinction between what is spoken and what is written. Every language that has a written idiom has this distinction to a greater or lesser degree. But Asian languages such as Maldivian seem to exhibit major differences between the two varieties of language. Malé Bas and Maliku Bas are the only dialects commonly used in writing.\n\nSpoken Maldivian, for instance, has twenty seven consonants. In contrast, written or literary Maldivian contains these sounds and some Arabic sounds as well. Though these sounds are also used in speaking, their phonetics are not strictly observed. This results in pronouncing it as close as possible to the Maldivian sounds when speaking.\n\nTo make things simpler it may be said that every sentence in written Maldivian ends with the addition of ‘ve’, which is never used to end a sentence in spoken Maldivian. In using ‘ve’ a strict word-order also has to be maintained. But in spoken Maldivian word-order is not considered to be very rigid.\n\nOne of the very important things one has to take into account in written Maldivian which is not so important in spoken Maldivian is the ‘sukun’ on the letters ‘alif’ and ‘shaviyani’. ‘Sukun’ in general is a mark to indicate an abrupt stop on the sound of the letter on which it is placed. However, if it comes within the word, the letter is repeated; if it comes on a ‘shaviyani’ or ‘alif’ at the end of a word, it signifies the sound ‘h’; if it comes on a ‘thaa’, the sound is replaced by ‘iy’.\n\nThe Maldivian language has had its own script since very ancient times, most likely over two millennia, when Maldivian Buddhist monks translated and copied the Buddhist scriptures.\n\nIt used to be written in the earlier form (Evēla) of the Dhives Akuru (\"Dhivehi/Maldivian letters\") which are written from left to right. Dhives Akuru were used in all of the islands between the conversion to Islam and until the 18th century. These ancient Maldivian letters were also used in official correspondence with Addu Atoll until the early 20th century. Perhaps they were used in some isolated islands and rural communities until the 1960s, but the last remaining native user died in the 1990s. Today Maldivians rarely learn the Dhives Akuru alphabet, for Arabic is being favoured as second script.\n\nMaldivian is now written using a different script, called Taana or Thaana, written from right to left. This script is relatively recent.\n\nThe literacy rate of the Maldives is very high (98%) compared to other South Asian countries. Since the 1960s English has become the medium of education in most schools although they still have Maldivian language classes, but Maldivian is still the language used for the overall administration.\n\nMaldivian uses mainly the Thaana script for writing. It is an alphabet, with obligatory vowels derived from the vowel diacritics of the Arabic abjad. It is a largely phonemic script: With a few minor exceptions, spelling can be predicted from pronunciation, and pronunciation from spelling.\n\nThe origins of Thaana are unique among the world's alphabets: The first nine letters (h–v) are derived from the Arabic numerals, whereas the next nine (m–d) were the local Indic numerals. (See Hindu-Arabic numerals.) The remaining letters for loanwords (t–z) and Arabic transliteration are derived from phonetically similar native consonants by means of diacritics, with the exception of y, which is of unknown origin. This means that Thaana is one of the few alphabets not derived graphically from the original Semitic alphabet – unless the Indic numerals were (see Brahmi numerals). The Thaana alphabet (hā, shaviyani, nūnu, rā, bā, ...) does not follow the ancient order of the other Indic scripts (like Sinhala or Tamil) or the order of the Arabic alphabet.\n\nThaana, like Hebrew and Arabic, is written right to left. It indicates vowels with diacritic marks derived from Arabic. Each letter must carry either a vowel or a \"sukun\", which indicates \"no vowel\". The only exception to this rule is \"noonu\" which, when written without a diacritic, indicates prenasalisation of a following stop.\n\nThe vowels are written with diacritical signs called \"fili\". There are five \"fili\" for short vowels (a, i, u, e, o), where the first three look identical to the Arabic vowel signs (\"fatha\", \"kasra\" and \"damma\"). Long vowels (aa, ee, oo, ey, oa) are denoted by doubled \"fili\" (except oa, which is a modification of the short \"obofili\").\n\nThe letter \"alifu\" has no sound value of its own and is used for three different purposes:\nIt can act as a carrier for a vowel with no preceding consonant, that is, a word-initial vowel or the second part of a diphthong; when it carries a \"sukun\", it indicates gemination (lengthening) of the following consonant; and if \"alifu\"+\"sukun\" occurs at the end of a word, it indicates that the word ends in /eh/. Gemination of nasals, however, is indicated by \"noonu\"+sukun preceding the nasal to be geminated.\n\nMaldivian is also written in Roman script and Devanāgarī script.\n\nTowards the mid-1970s, during President Ibrahim Nasir's tenure, the Maldivian government introduced telex machines in the local administration. This was viewed as great progress, but the local Thaana script was deemed to be an obstacle because messages on the telex machines could only be written in the Latin script.\n\nFollowing this, in 1976 the government approved a new official Latin transliteration, Dhivehi Latin, which was quickly implemented by the administration. Booklets were printed and dispatched to all Atoll and Island Offices, as well as schools and merchant liners. This was seen by many as the effective demise of the Thaana script.\nClarence Maloney, an American anthropologist who was in the Maldives at the time of the change, lamented the inconsistencies of the \"Dhivehi Latin\" which ignored all previous linguistic research on the Maldivian language done by H.C.P. Bell and Wilhelm Geiger. He wondered why the modern Standard Indic transliteration had not been considered. Standard Indic is a consistent script system that is well adapted to writing practically all languages of South Asia.\n\nThe government reinstated the Thaana script shortly after President Maumoon took power in 1978. There was widespread relief in certain places, especially rural areas, where the introduction of Latin had been regarded with suspicion. However, the substandard Latin transcription of 1976 continues to be widely used.\n\nThe 412-page hard-back English-Maldivian dictionary, \"A Maldivian Dictionary\", written by Christopher Hanby Baillie Reynolds, was published on 22 July 2003 by Routledge and contains about 5000 individual entries.\n\nThe sound system of Maldivian is similar to that of south Indian languages. Like other modern Indo-Aryan languages the Maldivian phonemic inventory shows an opposition of long and short vowels, of dental and retroflex consonants, and of single and geminate consonants.\n1 ‘Abafili’ is the vowel sign denoting “a”.\n\n2. ‘Ibifili’ is the vowel sign denoting “i”.\n\n3. ‘Ubufili’ is the vowel sign denoting “u”.\n\n4. ‘Sukun’ is the signdenoting absence of a vowel.\n\nThe short open back vowel is phonetically central .\n\nMaldivian, like English, has intonation, but its patterns are very different from those of English. In Maldivian, the general tendency is to stress the first syllable of a word.\n\nMaldivian has geminate consonants. For example, the two 's' sounds in \"vissaara\" (rain) fall into adjoining syllables: \"vis-saa-ra\". Similarly \"feth-thun\" (to swim), \"dhek-kun\" (to show).\n\nNative Maldivian (\"mabbas\") words do not allow initial consonant clusters; the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Maldivian restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using loan words, thus \"iskūl\" (VC.CVC) for \"skūl\" (CCVC) \"school\".\n\nThe old sequence of letters used to be:\n\nThe letters are now ordered:\n\nThe letter was replaced by , and the letter was regarded as a letter from the set of \"\" (pointed Thaana) during the rule of Mohamed Ameen Didi.\n\nNouns in Maldivian inflect for definiteness, number and case. Definiteness may be one of \"definite\", \"indefinite\" or \"unspecified\". Number may be \"singular\" or \"plural\". Case may be one of \"nominative\", \"dative\", \"ablative\", \"genitive\", \"locative\", \"instrumental\" or \"emphatic\".\n\nThe nominal system of Maldivian comprises nouns, pronouns, adjectives and numerals as parts of speech.\n\nMaldivian uses two numeral systems. Both of them are identical up to 30. After 30, however, one system places the unit numeral stem before the decade, for example, \"eh-thirees\" '31' ( \"one and thirty\") while the other combines the stem of the decade with the unit numeral, for example, \"thirees-ekeh\" '31' (\"thirty + one\"). The latter system also has numerals multiplied by ten for decades 70, 80 and 90. The decade \"fas dholhas\" '60' (\"five twelves\"), comes from a much older duodecimal, or dozen-based, system which has nearly disappeared.\n\nThe Maldivian verbal system is characterised by a derivational relationship between active, causative and involitive/intransitive verb forms.\n\nThe word order in Maldivian is not as rigid as in English, though changes in the order of words in a sentence may convey subtle differences in meaning. To ask for some fish in a market, one uses the following words: ‘mashah’ (to me) ‘mas’ (fish) ‘vikkaa’ (sell), which may be put in any of the following orders without a change in meaning:\n\nThe word ‘mashah’ (to me) may be dropped wherever the context makes it obvious.\n\nSpeakers of Maldivian use a great many loan words from many languages in their everyday conversation (see § Vocabulary). The extent to which loan words are used varies between speakers, depending on their contacts with that language. Thus, those who have had an English education will tend to use a larger number of English words, while an average speaker with little or no contact with English will tend to use just a few. Some of these adopted words have now become so much part of the Maldivian language that there seem to be no other words that could replace them.\n\nThere are different ways by which loan words are naturalised in Maldivian. This depends on whether the loan word refers to a person, a thing, or some kind of action.\n\nIf the loan word refers to a person, the following suffixes can be used: \n\nAmong some of the most common words of this kind are the following:\n\nactor (ektaru), \nagent (ejentu), \nambassador (embesedaru), \narchitect (aakitektu), \nbodyguard (bodeegaadu),\ncashier (keyshiyaru),\ndirector (direktaru, dairektaru), \ndoctor (daktaru), \ndriver (duraivaru), \nguard (gaadu), \ninspector (inispektaru), \nmanager (meneyjaru), \nminister (ministaru), \noperator (opareytaru), \nproducer (purodiusaru), \nsergeant (saajentu),\nservant (saaventu)\n\nIf the loan word refers to a thing, the suffixes are\n\nSome of the most commonly used words of this kind are the following:\n\nbicycle (baisikalu), \nbill (bilu), \ncable (keybalu), \ncake (keyku), \ncoat (koatu), \ncounter (kauntaru), \nparcel (paarisalu/paarusalu), \nticket (tiketu)\n\nIf the loan word refers to some kind of action, the Maldivian word 'kure' (present), ‘kuranee’ (present continuous), ‘koffi’ (present perfect), \"kuri\" (past) or ‘kuraane’ (future) is added after it, if it is done intentionally, and 've' (present),‘vanee’ (present continuous), ‘vejje’ (present perfect), 'vi' (past) and ‘vaane’ (future) is added after it, if it happens to be unintentional or passive. For example, using 'kensal' \"cancel\":\n\nSome examples:\n\nInherent in the Maldivian language is a form of elaborate class distinction expressed through three levels: The first level, the \"enme maaiy goiy\" (known colloquially as \"reethi bas\"), is used to address members of the upper class and of royal blood, but is now more often used on national radio and TV. To show respect for elders, officials and strangers the second level, \"maaiy goiy\" is used. People use the more informal third level \"aadhaige goiy\" in everyday life and to talk about themselves. Even a nobleman or a high official does not use the high level to talk about himself.\n\nRegarding salutations, there is no direct translation of the English \"hello\" or \"good-bye\" in Maldivian. Instead, islanders greet each other with a smile or the raising of the eyebrow and just ask \"where are you going?\", followed by \"what for?\". Goodbyes were not traditionally expressed, except in highly formal speech or in poetry\n\nMaldivian contains many loan words from other languages.\n\nAfter the arrival of Islam in South Asia, Persian and Arabic made a significant impact on Maldivian. It borrowed extensively from both languages, especially terms related to Islam and the judiciary. Some examples follow:\n\nPortuguese influence in the language can be seen from the period of Portuguese colonial power in the region. Some examples follow:\n\nMaldivian has also borrowed words from Urdu, Hindi and more recently, English (in particular many scientific and technological terms).\n\nEnglish words are also commonly used in the spoken language, for example \"phone\", \"note\", \"radio\", and \"\" (\"shorts\").\n\nThe following is a sample text in Maldivian, Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (by the United Nations):\nTransliteration (SAMT):\n\nGloss (word-for-word):\n\nTranslation (grammatical):\n\nFounded in 1984, the Mahal Unit Press at Minicoy prints texts in Maldivian, among other languages. The press also publishes the \"Lakshadweep Times\" in three languages on a regular basis: Maldivian, English and Malayalam. This unit is based in the main building, constructed in 1998. For the first time in the history of Lakshadweep, Maldivian was brought into the field of typography.\n\nActivities:\n\nFreely downloadable open-source Unicode typefaces featuring Thaana letters include FreeSerif and MPH 2B Damase.\n\nFthaana, Universal Word, Accent Express, Accent Special Edition are the most common word processors used. However now most of the people use MS Word to write Maldivian.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21794", "title": "Nostratic languages", "text": "Nostratic languages\n\nNostratic is a macrofamily, or hypothetical large-scale language family, which includes many of the indigenous language families of Eurasia, although its exact composition and structure vary among proponents. It typically comprises Kartvelian, Indo-European, and Uralic languages; some languages from the disputed Altaic family; the Afroasiatic languages spoken in North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East; and the Dravidian languages of the Indian Subcontinent (sometimes also Elamo-Dravidian, which connects India and the Iranian Plateau).\n\nThe hypothetical ancestral language of the Nostratic family is called Proto-Nostratic. Proto-Nostratic would have been spoken between 15,000 and 12,000 BCE, in the Epipaleolithic period, close to the end of the last glacial period.\n\nThe Nostratic hypothesis originates with Holger Pedersen in the early 20th century. The name \"Nostratic\" is due to Pedersen (1903), derived from the Latin \"nostrates\" \"fellow countrymen\". The hypothesis was significantly expanded in the 1960s by Soviet linguists, notably Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky, termed the \"Moscovite school\" by Bomhard (2008, 2011, and 2014), and it has received renewed attention in English-speaking academia since the 1990s.\n\nThe hypothesis is controversial and has varying degrees of acceptance amongst linguists worldwide. In Russia, it is endorsed by a minority of linguists, such as Vladimir Dybo, but is not a generally accepted hypothesis. Allan Bomhard is a supporter, Lyle Campbell a critic. Some linguists take an agnostic view. Eurasiatic, a similar grouping, was proposed by Joseph Greenberg (2000) and endorsed by Merritt Ruhlen: it is taken as a subfamily of Nostratic by Bomhard (2008).\n\nThe last quarter of the 19th century saw various linguists putting forward proposals linking the Indo-European languages to other language families, such as Finno-Ugric and Altaic.\n\nThese proposals were taken much further in 1903 when Holger Pedersen proposed \"Nostratic\", a common ancestor for the Indo-European, Finno-Ugric, Samoyed, Turkish, Mongolian, Manchu, Yukaghir, Eskimo, Semitic, and Hamitic languages, with the door left open to the eventual inclusion of others.\n\nThe name \"Nostratic\" derives from the Latin word \"nostrās\", meaning 'our fellow-countryman' (plural: \"nostrates\") and has been defined, since Pedersen, as consisting of those language families that are related to Indo-European. Merritt Ruhlen notes that this definition is not properly taxonomic but amorphous, since there are broader and narrower degrees of relatedness, and moreover, some linguists who broadly accept the concept (such as Greenberg and Ruhlen himself) have criticised the name as reflecting the ethnocentrism frequent among Europeans at the time. Martin Bernal has described the term as distasteful because it implies that speakers of other language families are excluded from academic discussion. Even so, the concept arguably transcends ethnocentric associations. (Indeed, Pedersen's older contemporary Henry Sweet attributed some of the resistance by Indo-European specialists to hypotheses of wider genetic relationships as \"prejudice against dethroning [Indo-European] from its proud isolation and affiliating it to the languages of yellow races\".) Proposed alternative names such as \"Mitian\", formed from the characteristic Nostratic first- and second-person pronouns \"mi\" 'I' and \"ti\" 'you' (exactly 'thee'), have not attained the same currency.\n\nAn early supporter was the French linguist Albert Cuny—better known for his role in the development of the laryngeal theory—who published his \"Recherches sur le vocalisme, le consonantisme et la formation des racines en « nostratique », ancêtre de l'indo-européen et du chamito-sémitique\" ('Researches on the Vocalism, Consonantism, and Formation of Roots in \"Nostratic\", Ancestor of Indo-European and Hamito-Semitic') in 1943. Although Cuny enjoyed a high reputation as a linguist, the work was coldly received.\n\nWhile Pedersen's Nostratic hypothesis did not make much headway in the West, it became quite popular in what was then the Soviet Union. Working independently at first, Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky elaborated the first version of the contemporary form of the hypothesis during the 1960s. They expanded it to include additional language families. Illich-Svitych also prepared the first dictionary of the hypothetical language.\n\nA principal source for the items in Illich-Svitych's dictionary was the earlier work of Alfredo Trombetti (1866–1929), an Italian linguist who had developed a classification scheme for all the world's languages, widely reviled at the time and subsequently ignored by almost all linguists. In Trombetti's time, a widely held view on classifying languages was that similarity in inflections is the surest proof of genetic relationship. In the interim, the view had taken hold that the comparative method—previously used as a means of studying languages already known to be related and without any thought of classification—is the most effective means to establish genetic relationship, eventually hardening into the conviction that it is the only legitimate means to do so. This view was basic to the outlook of the new Nostraticists. Although Illich-Svitych adopted many of Trombetti's etymologies, he sought to validate them by a systematic comparison of the sound systems of the languages concerned.\n\nThe chief events in Nostratic studies in 2008 were the posting online of the latest version of Dolgopolsky's \"Nostratic Dictionary\" and the publication of Allan Bomhard's comprehensive treatment of the subject, \"Reconstructing Proto-Nostratic\", in 2 volumes. 2008 also saw the opening of a website, \"Nostratica\", devoted to providing important texts in Nostratic studies online, which is now offline. Also significant was Bomhard's partly critical review of Dolgopolsky's dictionary, in which he argued that only those Nostratic etymologies that are strongest should be included, in contrast to Dolgopolsky's more expansive approach, which includes many etymologies that are possible but not secure.\n\nIn early 2014, Allan Bomhard published his latest monograph on Nostratic, \"A Comprehensive Introduction to Nostratic Comparative Linguistics\".\n\nThe language families proposed for inclusion in Nostratic vary, but all Nostraticists agree on a common core of language families, with differences of opinion appearing over the inclusion of additional families.\n\nThe three groups universally accepted among Nostraticists are Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic; the validity of the Altaic family, while itself controversial, is taken for granted by Nostraticists. Nearly all also include the Kartvelian and Dravidian language families.\n\nFollowing Pedersen, Illich-Svitych, and Dolgopolsky, most advocates of the theory have included Afroasiatic, though criticisms by Joseph Greenberg and others from the late 1980s onward suggested a reassessment of this position.\n\nA fairly representative grouping, arranged in rough geographical order (and probable order of phylogenetic branching, following Starostin), would include:\n\n\nThe Sumerian and Etruscan languages, usually regarded as language isolates, are thought by some to be Nostratic languages as well. Others, however, consider one or both to be members of another macrofamily called Dené–Caucasian. Another notional isolate, the Elamite language, also figures in a number of Nostratic classifications. It is frequently grouped with Dravidian as Elamo-Dravidian.\n\nIn 1987 Joseph Greenberg proposed a similar macrofamily which he called Eurasiatic. It included the same \"Euraltaic\" core (Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic), but excluded some of the above-listed families, most notably Afroasiatic. At about this time Russian Nostraticists, notably Sergei Starostin, constructed a revised version of Nostratic which was slightly broader than Greenberg's grouping but which similarly left out Afroasiatic.\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, a consensus emerged among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian). The American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic alongside other branches: Kartvelian, Afroasiatic, and Elamo-Dravidian. Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to anything else. Sergei Starostin's school has now re-included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic, while reserving the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Kartvelian and Dravidian.\n\nAccording to Greenberg, Eurasiatic and Amerind form a genetic node, being more closely related to each other than either is to \"the other families of the Old World\". There are a number of hypotheses incorporating Nostratic into an even broader linguistic 'mega-phylum', sometimes called Borean, which would also include at least the Dené–Caucasian and perhaps the Amerind and Austric superfamilies. The term SCAN has been used for a group that would include Sino-Caucasian, Amerind, and Nostratic.\n\nAllan Bomhard and Colin Renfrew are in broad agreement with the earlier conclusions of Illich-Svitych and Dolgopolsky in seeking the Nostratic Urheimat (original homeland) within the Mesolithic (or Epipaleolithic) in the Fertile Crescent, the stage which directly preceded the Neolithic and was transitional to it.\n\nLooking at the cultural assemblages of this period, two sequences in particular stand out as possible archeological correlates of the earliest Nostratians or their immediate precursors. Both hypotheses place Proto-Nostratic within the Fertile Crescent at around the end of the last glacial period.\n\n\nIt has been proposed that the broad spectrum revolution of Kent Flannery (1969), associated with microliths, the use of the bow and arrow, and the domestication of the dog, all of which are associated with these cultures, might have been the cultural \"motor\" that led to their expansion. Certainly cultures which appeared at Franchthi Cave in the Aegean and Lepenski Vir in the Balkans, and the Murzak-Koba (9100–8000 BC) and Grebenki (8500–7000 BC) cultures of the Ukrainian steppe, all displayed these adaptations. \n\nBomhard (2008) suggests a differentiation of Proto-Nostratic by 8,000 BCE, the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution in the Levant, over a territory spanning the entire Fertile Crescent and beyond into the Caucasus (Proto-Kartvelian), Egypt and along the Red Sea to the Horn of Africa (Proto-Afroasiatic), the Iranian Plateau (Proto-Elamo-Dravidian) and into Central Asia (Proto-Eurasiatic, to be further subdivided by 5,000 BCE into Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Uralic and Proto-Altaic).\n\nAccording to some scholarly opinion the Kebaran is derived from the Levantine Upper Palaeolithic in which the microlithic component originated, although microlithic cultures were earlier found in Africa.\n\nOuchtata retouch is also a characteristic of the Late Ahmarian Upper Palaeolithic culture of the Levant and may not indicate African influence.\n\nThe following data is taken from Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988) and Bengtson (1998) and transcribed into the .\n\nThe phonemes tabulated below are commonly reconstructed for the Proto-Nostratic language (Kaiser and Shevoroshkin 1988). Allan Bomhard (2008), who relies more heavily on Afroasiatic and Dravidian than on Uralic, as do members of the \"Moscow School\", reconstructs a different vowel system, with three pairs of vowels represented as: , as well as independent /i/, /o/, and /u/. In the first three pairs of vowels, Bomhard is attempting to specify the subphonemic variation involved, inasmuch as that variation led to some of the vowel gradation (ablaut) and vowel harmony patterning found in various daughter languages.\n\nThe reconstructed consonants of Nostratic are shown in the table below. Every distinction is supposed to be contrastive by the Nostraticists who reconstruct them.\n\nThe following table is compiled from data given by Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988) and Starostin. They follow Illich-Svitych's correspondences in which Nostratic voiceless stops give (traditional) PIE voiced ones, and Nostratic glottalized stops give (traditional) PIE voiceless stops, in contradiction with the PIE glottalic theory, which makes traditional PIE voiced stops appeared like glottalized ones. To correct this anomaly, linguists such as Manaster Ramer and Bomhard have proposed to correlate Nostratic voiceless and glottalized stops with PIE ones, so this is done in the table.\n\nBecause linguists working on Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Uralic, and Proto-Dravidian do not usually use the IPA, the transcriptions used in those fields are also given where the letters differ from the IPA symbols. The IPA symbols are between slashes because this is a phonemic transcription. The exact values of the phoneme \"*p₁\" in Proto-Afroasiatic and Proto-Dravidian are unknown. \"∅\" indicates disappearance without a trace. Hyphens indicate different developments at the beginning and in the interior of words; no consonants ever occurred at the ends of word roots. (Starostin's list of affricate and fricative correspondences does not mention Afroasiatic or Dravidian, and Kaiser and Shevoroshkin don't mention these sounds much; hence the holes in the table.)\n\nNote that, due to lack of research, there are at present several different mutually incompatible reconstructions of Proto-Afroasiatic (see for two recent reconstructions). The one used here has been said to be based too strongly on Proto-Semitic (Yakubovich 1998).\n\nSimilarly, the paper by Kaiser and Shevoroshkin is much older than the newest \"Altaic Etymological Dictionary\" (2003; see Altaic languages article) and therefore assumes a somewhat different phonological system for Proto-Altaic.\n\nBecause grammar is less easily borrowed than words, grammar is usually considered stronger evidence for language relationships than vocabulary. The following correspondences (slightly modified to account for the reconstruction of Proto-Altaic by Starostin et al. [2003]) have been suggested by Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988). /N/ could be any nasal consonant. /V/ could be any vowel. (The above cautionary notes on Afroasiatic and Dravidian apply.)\n\nIn addition, Kaiser and Shevoroshkin write the following about Proto-Nostratic grammar (two asterisks are used for reconstructions based on reconstructions; citation format changed):\n\nThe verb stood at the end of the sentence (SV and SOV type). The 1st p[er]s[on] was formed by adding the 1st ps. pronoun **mi to the verb; similarly, the 2nd ps. was formed by adding **ti. There were no endings for the 3rd ps. present [\"or at least none can be reconstructed\"], while the 3rd ps. preterit ending was **-di (Illich-Svitych 1971, pp. 218–19). Verbs could be active and passive, causative, desiderative, and reflective; and there were special markers for most of these categories. Nouns could be animate or inanimate, and plural markers differed for each category. There were subject and object markers, locative and lative enclitic particles, etc. Pronouns distinguished direct and oblique forms, animate and inanimate categories, notions of the type 'near':'far', inclusive:exclusive [...], etc. Apparently there were no prefixes. Nostratic words were either equal to roots or built by adding endings or suffixes. There are some cases of word composition...\n\nAccording to Dolgopolsky Proto-Nostratic language had analytic structure, which he argues by diverging of post- and prepositions of auxiliary words in descendant languages.\nDolgopolsky states three lexical categories to be in Proto-Nostratic language:\nWord order was subject–object–verb when the subject was a noun, and object–verb–subject when it was a pronoun. Attributive (expressed by a lexical word) preceded its head. Pronominal attributive ('my', 'this') might follow the noun. Auxiliary words are considered to be postpositions.\n\nThe list of etymologies of lexical words reconstructed by Dolgopolsky that are considered by Bomhard to be well-founded (noted as \"strong\") includes the following:\n\n\n\nPersonal pronouns are seldom borrowed between languages. Therefore the many correspondences between Nostratic pronouns are rather strong evidence for the existence of a Proto-Nostratic language. The difficulty of finding Afroasiatic cognates is, however, taken by some as evidence that Nostratic has two or three branches, Afroasiatic and Eurasiatic (and possibly Dravidian), and that most or all of the pronouns in the following table can only be traced to Proto-Eurasiatic.\n\nNivkh is a living (if moribund) language with an orthography, which is given here. /V/ means that it is not clear which vowel should be reconstructed.\n\nFor space reasons, Etruscan is not included, but the fact that it had /mi/ 'I' and /mini/ 'me' seems to fit the pattern reconstructed for Proto-Nostratic ideally, leading some to argue that the Aegean or Tyrsenian languages were yet another Nostratic branch.\n\nThere is no reconstruction of Proto-Eskimo–Aleut, although the existence of the Eskimo–Aleut family is generally accepted.\n\nBelow are selected reconstructed etymologies from Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988) and Bengtson (1998). Reconstructed ( = unattested) forms are marked with an asterisk. /V/ means that it is not clear which vowel should be reconstructed. Likewise, /E/ could have been any front vowel and /N/ any nasal consonant. Only the consonants are given of Proto-Afroasiatic roots (see above).\n\n\nVladislav Illich-Svitych using his version of Proto-Nostratic composed a brief poem. (Compare Schleicher's fable for similar attempts with several different reconstructions of Proto-Indo-European.)\n\nThe value of K̥ or is uncertain—it could be or . H could similarly be at least or . V or is an uncertain vowel.\n\nWhile the Nostratic hypothesis is not endorsed by the mainstream of comparative linguistics, Nostratic studies by nature of being based on the comparative method remain within the mainstream of contemporary linguistics from a methodological point of view; it is the scope with which the comparative method is applied rather than the methodology itself that raises eyebrows.\n\nNostraticists tend to refuse to include in their schema language families for which no proto-language has yet been reconstructed. This approach was criticized by Joseph Greenberg on the ground that genetic classification is necessarily prior to linguistic reconstruction, but this criticism has so far had no effect on Nostraticist theory and practice.\n\nCertain critiques have pointed out that the data from individual, established language families that is cited in Nostratic comparisons often involves a high degree of errors; Campbell (1998) demonstrates this for Uralic data. Defenders of the Nostratic theory argue that were this to be true, it would remain that in classifying languages genetically, positives count for vastly more than negatives (Ruhlen 1994). The reason for this is that, above a certain threshold, resemblances in sound/meaning correspondences are highly improbable mathematically.\n\nPedersen's original Nostratic proposal synthesized earlier macrofamilies, some of which, including Indo-Uralic, involved extensive comparison of inflections. It is true the Russian Nostraticists and Bomhard initially emphasized lexical comparisons. Bomhard recognized the necessity to explore morphological comparisons and has since published extensive work in this area (see especially Bomhard 2008:1.273–386). According to him the breakthrough came with the publication of the first volume of Joseph Greenberg's Eurasiatic work, which provided a massive list of possible morphemic correspondences that has proved fruitful to explore. Other important contributions on Nostratic morphology have been published by John C. Kerns and Vladimir Dybo.\n\nCritics argue that were one to collect all the words from the various known Indo-European languages and dialects which have at least one of any 4 meanings, one could easily form a list that would cover any conceivable combination of two consonants and a vowel (of which there are only about 20×20×5 = 2000). Nostraticists respond that they do not compare isolated lexical items but reconstructed proto-languages. To include a word for a proto-language it must be found in a number of languages and the forms must be relatable by regular sound changes. In addition, many languages have restrictions on root structure, reducing the number of possible root-forms far below its mathematical maximum. These languages include, among others, Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic—all the core languages of the Nostratic hypothesis. To understand how the root structures of one language relate to those of another has long been a focus of Nostratic studies. For a highly critical assessment of the work of the Moscow School, especially the work of Illich-Svitych, cf. Campbell and Poser 2008:243-264.\n\nIt has also been argued that Nostratic comparisons mistake Wanderwörter and cross-borrowings between branches for true cognates.\n\n\n\n"}

He received his education at the Armenian school in Kadıköy, then continued at the Getronagan Armenian High School, but financial constraints forced him to quit school and work as a clerk to a merchant. His first articles appeared in the daily Surhantak (Messenger) in 1900. The following year he was invited by Arpiar Arpiarian (1852-1907) and Krikor Zohrab (1861-1915) to contribute to the Massis newspaper, where his first short stories were published. In 1902-03 he traveled through Italy, Switzerland, France, and England, acquainting himself with the literary trends of the region, and returned home with new impressions. There followed a fertile creative period. He became a regular contributor to a number of periodicals in addition to Massis such as \"Tsaghig\" (Flower), \"Arevelyan Mamul\" (Eastern Press), \"Shirak\", \"Hay Kraganutyun\" (Armenian Literature), \"Byuzantium\", Teotig's \"Amenuyn Daretyutsi\" (Everyone's Almanac), and others. He also served as an elected member of the Armenian National Assembly. At the start of the First World War he was drafted into the Turkish army and thus spared the horrible fate met by most of his writer colleagues during the Armenian Genocide.\n\nIn 1919 he founded a weekly paper \"Hay Mitk\" (Armenian Mind), which, though it had only a brief life, reflected at length and in depth upon the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide. In one article he says: \"As the tattered remnants of six hundred years of slavery and suffering, what we lived through these four horrendous years was the sum total of the misery of that entire period. Now our generation, beheaded of its intellectuals, dismembered, stricken at heart, humpbacked and aged, is left like a paralyzed and stunned invalid.\" In the same year he was teaching in an Armenian orphanage that sheltered hundreds of children retrieved from deportation camps. He was so closely associated with these children that in 1920, when the orphanage moved to the Greek island of Corfu, he moved with them. The literature he produced the following years was strongly influenced by the psychological devastation cause by the Armenian Genocide. At this time he signed his works Hovhannes Aspet.\n\nIn 1923 he was in Marseille, as principal of the local Armenian National School, and in 1928 in Geneva, as a teacher, where remained for the rest of his life.\n\nRealism was the dominant trend when he started his literary career, and Krikor Zohrab was the undisputed master. \"His name has a gravitational attraction,\" he wrote in 1901. \"There is charm in the way he writes, the way he thinks, and the way he lives.\" Zohrab's influence on Chifte-Saraf's earlier stories is particularly strong. His own aesthetic principle, however, is that nature and life conceal such a wealth of unequaled beauties in their depths that even the strongest poetic imagination cannot rival them. There are few characters and little action in his short stories, but plenty of love, emotion, and passion. His heroes are compassionate lovers of good, beauty, and harmony, and always of a lyrical disposition. Because he was an admirer of Émile Zola, some critics also claimed to detect a trace of naturalism in his realism.\n\nAlthough Chifte-Saraf wrote a great number of articles, reports, travel notes, meditations, and sketches, he made his fame with short stories, of which some of the best known are \"Jermaknerov\" (Clothed in White), \"Metz Ayon\" (The Big Yes), \"Hokineru Prgutyun\" (Salvation of Souls), \"Pajanumi Kisheri\" (The Night of Separation), \"Speghani\" (Healing Ointment), \"Zeytuntsi Patanin\" (The Youth of Zeytun), and \"Khachelutyun\" (Crucifixion). His best known work is \"Miamiti me Argatsneri\" (The Adventures of a Naive Young Man, 1908), his only novel, which depicts the prodigal life of a youth who inherits considerable wealth from his Scrooge-like uncle.\n"}

Sometimes the same producers would start a new studio when the old one failed, such as Harry S. Webb and Bernard B.

{"id": "97812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97812", "title": "Richard's paradox", "text": "Richard's paradox\n\nIn logic, Richard's paradox is a semantical antinomy of set theory and natural language first described by the French mathematician Jules Richard in 1905. The paradox is ordinarily used to motivate the importance of distinguishing carefully between mathematics and metamathematics. Kurt Gödel specifically cites Richard's antinomy as a semantical analogue to his syntactical incompleteness result in the introductory section of \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\". The paradox was also a motivation of the development of predicative mathematics.\n\nThe original statement of the paradox, due to Richard (1905), is strongly related to Cantor's diagonal argument on the uncountability of the set of real numbers.\n\nThe paradox begins with the observation that certain expressions of natural language define real numbers unambiguously, while other expressions of natural language do not. For example, \"The real number the integer part of which is 17 and the \"n\"th decimal place of which is 0 if \"n\" is even and 1 if \"n\" is odd\" defines the real number 17.1010101... = 1693/99, while the phrase \"the capital of England\" does not define a real number, also, the phrase \"the smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters\" does not define a real number (see Berry's paradox).\n\nThus there is an infinite list of English phrases (such that each phrase is of finite length, but lengths vary in the list) that define real numbers unambiguously. We first arrange this list of phrases by increasing length, then order all phrases of equal length lexicographically (in dictionary order, e.g. we can use the ASCII code, the phrases can only contain codes 32 to 126), so that the ordering is canonical. This yields an infinite list of the corresponding real numbers: \"r\", \"r\", ... . Now define a new real number \"r\" as follows. The integer part of \"r\" is 0, the \"n\"th decimal place of \"r\" is 1 if the \"n\"th decimal place of \"r\" is not 1, and the \"n\"th decimal place of \"r\" is 2 if the \"n\"th decimal place of \"r\" is 1.\n\nThe preceding two paragraphs are an expression in English that unambiguously defines a real number \"r\". Thus \"r\" must be one of the numbers \"r\". However, \"r\" was constructed so that it cannot equal any of the \"r\" (thus, \"r\" is an undefinable number). This is the paradoxical contradiction.\n\nRichard's paradox results in an untenable contradiction, which must be analyzed to find an error.\n\nThe proposed definition of the new real number \"r\" clearly includes a finite sequence of characters, and hence it seems at first to be a definition of a real number. However, the definition refers to definability-in-English itself. If it were possible to determine which English expressions actually \"do\" define a real number, and which do not, then the paradox would go through. Thus the resolution of Richard's paradox is that there is not any way to unambiguously determine exactly which English sentences are definitions of real numbers (see Good 1966). That is, there is not any way to describe in a finite number of words how to tell whether an arbitrary English expression is a definition of a real number. This is not surprising, as the ability to make this determination would also imply the ability to solve the halting problem and perform any other non-algorithmic calculation that can be described in English.\n\nA similar phenomenon occurs in formalized theories that are able to refer to their own syntax, such as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). Say that a formula φ(\"x\") \"defines a real number\" if there is exactly one real number \"r\" such that φ(\"r\") holds. Then it is not possible to define, by ZFC, the set of all (Gödel numbers of) formulas that define real numbers. For, if it were possible to define this set, it would be possible to diagonalize over it to produce a new definition of a real number, following the outline of Richard's paradox above. Note that the set of formulas that define real numbers may exist, as a set \"F\"; the limitation of ZFC is that there is not any formula that defines \"F\" without reference to other sets. This is related to Tarski's indefinability theorem.\n\nThe example of ZFC illustrates the importance of distinguishing the metamathematics of a formal system from the statements of the formal system itself. The property D(φ) that a formula φ of ZFC defines a unique real number is not itself expressible by ZFC, but must be considered as part of the metatheory used to formalize ZFC. From this viewpoint, Richard's paradox results from treating a construction of the metatheory (the enumeration of all statements in the original system that define real numbers) as if that construction could be performed in the original system.\n\nA variation of the paradox uses integers instead of real-numbers, while preserving the self-referential character of the original. Consider a language (such as English) in which the arithmetical properties of integers are defined. For example, \"the first natural number\" defines the property of being the first natural number, one; and \"divisible by exactly two natural numbers\" defines the property of being a prime number. (It is clear that some properties cannot be defined explicitly, since every deductive system must start with some axioms. But for the purposes of this argument, it is assumed that phrases such as \"an integer is the sum of two integers\" are already understood.) While the list of all such possible definitions is itself infinite, it is easily seen that each individual definition is composed of a finite number of words, and therefore also a finite number of characters. Since this is true, we can order the definitions, first by length and then lexicographically.\n\nNow, we may map each definition to the set of natural numbers, such that the definition with the smallest number of characters and alphabetical order will correspond to the number 1, the next definition in the series will correspond to 2, and so on. Since each definition is associated with a unique integer, then it is possible that occasionally the integer assigned to a definition \"fits\" that definition. If, for example, the definition \"not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself\" happened to be 43rd, then this would be true. Since 43 is itself not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, then the number of this definition has the property of the definition itself. However, this may not always be the case. If the definition: \"divisible by 3\" were assigned to the number 58, then the number of the definition does \"not\" have the property of the definition itself. Since 58 is itself not divisible by 3. This latter example will be termed as having the property of being \"Richardian\". Thus, if a number is Richardian, then the definition corresponding to that number is a property that the number itself does not have. (More formally, \"\"x\" is Richardian\" is equivalent to \"\"x\" does \"not\" have the property designated by the defining expression with which \"x\" is correlated in the serially ordered set of definitions\".) Thus in this example, 58 is Richardian, but 43 is not. \n\nNow, since the property of being Richardian is itself a numerical property of integers, it belongs in the list of all definitions of properties. Therefore, the property of being Richardian is assigned some integer, \"n\". For example, if the definition: \"being Richardian\" were assigned to the number 92. Finally, the paradox becomes: Is 92 Richardian? Suppose 92 is Richardian. This is only possible if 92 does not have the property designated by the defining expression which it is correlated with. In other words, this means 92 is not Richardian, contradicting our assumption. However, if we suppose 92 is not Richardian, then it does have the defining property which it corresponds to. This, by definition, means that it is Richardian, again contrary to assumption. Thus, the statement \"92 is Richardian\" cannot consistently be designated as either true or false.\n\nAnother opinion concerning Richard's paradox relates to mathematical predicativism. By this view, the real numbers are defined in stages, with each stage only making reference to previous stages and other things that have already been defined. From a predicative viewpoint it is not valid to quantify over \"all\" real numbers in the process of generating a new real number, because this is believed to result in a circularity problem in the definitions. Set theories such as ZFC are not based on this sort of predicative framework, and allow impredicative definitions.\n\nRichard (1905) presented a solution to the paradox from the viewpoint of predicativisim. Richard claimed that the flaw of the paradoxical construction was that the expression for the construction of the real number \"r\" does not actually define a real number unambiguously, because the statement refers to the construction of an infinite set of real numbers, of which \"r\" itself is a part. Thus, Richard says, the real number \"r\" will not be included as any \"r\", because the definition of \"r\" does not meet the criteria for being included in the sequence of definitions used to construct the sequence \"r\". Contemporary mathematicians agree that the definition of \"r\" is invalid, but for a different reason. They believe the definition of \"r\" is invalid because there is no well-defined notion of when an English phrase defines a real number, and so there is no unambiguous way to construct the sequence \"r\".\n\nAlthough Richard's solution to the paradox did not gain favor with mathematicians, predicativism is an important part of the study of the foundations of mathematics. Predicativism was first studied in detail by Hermann Weyl in \"Das Kontinuum\", wherein he showed that much of elementary real analysis can be conducted in a predicative manner starting with only the natural numbers. More recently, predicativism has been studied by Solomon Feferman, who has used proof theory to explore the relationship between predicative and impredicative systems.\n\n\n\n"}

The handshake is made with the hand nearest to the heart and is offered as a token of friendship. In most situations, the handshake is made firmly, without interlocking fingers, and many organizations only use this handshake when both people are in uniform. There are some variations of the handshake between national Scouting organizations and also within some program sections.\n\nThe 1935 Boy Scout Handbook says that \"By agreement of the Scout Leaders throughout the world, Boy Scouts greet Brother Scouts with a warm left hand clasp.\"\n\nAll World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts members share the left handshake, and when meeting other Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, it may be used in conjunction with the Scout sign done with the right hand.\n\nVarious sources have attributed the origin of the handshake, as an ancient sign of bravery and respect, to Lord Baden-Powell's encounter after battle with Prempeh I, or to earlier published works by Ernest Thompson Seton. There exist various versions of the Prempeh story, all centering on African warriors using the left hand to hold their shields and to lower it and shake the left hand of the person was to show they trusted each other.\n\nAccording to the Ashanti warrior version of the story, then-Colonel Baden-Powell saluted them with his right hand, but the Ashanti chiefs offered their left hands and said, \"In our land only the bravest of the brave shake hands with the left hand, because to do so we must drop our shields and our protection.\" The Ashantis knew of Baden-Powell's bravery because they had fought against him and with him, and they were proud to offer the left hand of bravery.\n\nAnother version of the story is that the left-handed handshake was a homage paid to Chief Kweku Andoh who was left-handed and had the tendency to shake hands with his left. Baden-Powell dedicated his account 'The Downfall of Prempeh' to him: \"(Without His Permission). To Chief Andoh of Elmina. My Guide, Adviser and Friend\". Chief Kweku Andoh was the officer in the British Army that led the troops to Kumase when they captured Prempeh I and purportedly taught Baden-Powell how to scout in the jungle.\n\nThe term itself was used as the title of a work by Hilary Saint George Saunders, \"The Left Handshake: The Boy Scout Movement during the War, 1939-1945\", because of the extraordinary courage shown during those times. According to the foreword by British Chief Scout Lord Rowallan,\n\nWhen Colonel Baden-Powell entered the capital city of the Ashanti people in 1890 he was met by one of the Chiefs who came to him holding out his left hand. B.-P. held out his right in return but the Chief said: \"No, in my country the bravest of the brave shake with the left hand.\" So began the \"left handshake\" of the world-wide brotherhood of Scouts. In this book are told some of the stories of courage and endurance shown by Scouts in many different countries during the war of 1939-45. There would not be room even in many books to tell them all. Many, indeed, can never be told; some for political reasons, some because the actors died unknown. They remembered their Promise, to do their best to do their duty to God, and their Country; to think of other people and not themselves. So, when the time came, they were prepared in body and in spirit to render their service. Their record is unsurpassed; they were \"the bravest of the brave.\"\n\nThe left hand is also closer to the heart, with that attendant symbolism.\n\n\n"}

Since Hebrew is the original language of the Hebrew Bible (known as the Torah and Tanakh), it is therefore a language that has always been central to Judaism and valued by the Jewish people for over three thousand years and later by Christian scholars as well.\n\nThe beginnings of the study of Hebrew are found in the Talmud and Midrash, which have some grammatical notes. The Masoretes continued the study as they fixed the text and vocalization of the Hebrew Bible. Under the influence of the Arab grammarians, Rabbi Saadia Gaon (tenth century) made the Jewish study of Hebrew grammar almost scientific. Later Jewish grammarians include David Qimhi (known as the Radak), Abraham ibn Ezra, and Judah ben David Hayyuj.\n\nEliezer Ben Yehuda is credited by many as being almost single-handedly responsible for the Zionist movement's revitalization of Hebrew as a modern spoken language, although in his book \"Language in Time of Revolution\" the Israeli linguist and literature researcher Benjamin Harshav diminishes Ben-Yehuda's role and attributes the success of the revival to a wider movement in the Jewish society.\n\nThe first major non-Jewish grammarian was John Reuchlin (16th century), but it was not until the early 19th century that Hebrew linguistics was studied on a secular, scientific level. The pioneer of this movement was Wilhelm Gesenius, who published thirteen editions of his \"Hebräische Grammatik\". After Gesenius' death in 1842, the 14th through 21st editions were published by E. Rödiger, and the 22nd through 28th editions were published by Emil Kautzsch. Many of these editions were translated into English; the 28th edition was done in 1910 by A. E. Cowley and is known today simply as \"\". It became the standard Hebrew reference grammar and although it is somewhat outdated by newer works, it is still widely used in the field in the 21st century.\n\nThe largest compendium of Hebrew grammatical material is König's \"Historisch-Kritisches Lehrgebäude der Hebräischen Sprache\" (1881-97).\n\nPaul Joüon's \"Grammaire de l'hébreu biblique\" (1923) was recently edited and translated into English by Muraoka as \"A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew\" (1991; revised edition 2006). Muraoka made this into the most complete and up-to-date reference grammar. Also quite modern is Rudolf Meyer's \"Hebräische Grammatik\" (1966-72), but it is not quite as thorough as Joüon-Muraoka. Of note as well is Mayer Lambert's \"Traité de grammaire hébraïque\" (1931).\n\nThe most thorough, well-organized, and analytically incisive Hebrew grammar is the 29th edition of Gesenius' grammar by Gotthelf Bergsträsser. However, the author only managed to complete the sections on Phonology (1918) and the Verb (1929) before his untimely death. Although other grammars are more current, Bergsträsser's is unsurpassed due to its depth and insight. Another excellent grammar is Hans Bauer and Pontus Leander's \"Historische Grammatik der Hebräischen Sprache des Alten Testaments\" (1917-22) although it, too, lacks syntax. Neither grammar has been translated into English, although Bergsträsser's has been translated into Hebrew (Jerusalem, 1972).\n\nOne must note the contributions, in recent years, of Israeli scholars to the field of Hebrew linguistics, most notably Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai, Chaim Menachem Rabin, E. Y. Kutscher, Shelomo Morag, Joshua Blau, Ze'ev Ben-Hayyim, Elisha Qimron and Moshe Bar-Asher.\n\nThe Academy of the Hebrew Language\n(האקדמיה ללשון העברית) in modern Israel is the \"Supreme Foundation for the Science of the Hebrew Language\" founded by the Israeli Government in 1953. This academy is responsible for creating new Hebrew words to keep up with today's rapidly changing society. In addition, the academy has the \"final say\" concerning matters of spelling and grammar.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26009616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26009616", "title": "Teaching writing in the United States", "text": "Teaching writing in the United States\n\nTeaching writing in the United States has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States.\n\nAt its most basic level, writing is how people keep track of the thoughts that are important to them. From the ancient Egyptians, to the monks of the Middle Ages, to Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, writing has been used to capture thought, from the mundane to the profound. In schools, writing serves not only to record and convey thoughts, but to refine and synthesize thinking. As school effectiveness researcher Doug Reeves discovered, \"The association between writing and performance in other academic disciplines [is] striking, and gets to the heart of the curriculum choices teachers must make.\"\n\nEarly academic instruction in writing centered almost exclusively on mechanics, commonly referred to today as conventions. Emphasis was placed on handwriting, grammar, punctuation and spelling. Papers were more likely to be graded on conformity to these conventions and accuracy of content than on style or creative expression of ideas. Historically, instruction in writing has focused on a narrow pool of concrete, easily definable skills.\n\nResearch conducted in the late 1970s by Donald Graves, Janet Emig and others led to a focus on the process, rather than solely the product, of writing. The writing process approach rests on the premise that writing is a complex and individualized task which can be described through a series of recursive stages. These stages, commonly including pre-writing, writing, editing and revision, and the concepts of craft within them, can be modeled and taught to students. This allows the teacher to identify the difficulties students are having with writing and to provide appropriate instruction and support. The writing process approach helps students to understand what writers actually do when they write, providing multiple models and individual feedback on writing pieces in progress. Students are encouraged to choose their own topics and purposes for writing, and to write to real audiences. This approach has been widely adopted in schools throughout the United States.\n\nA new way to have students write is to work together – known as collaborative writing. There are many criticisms against collaborative writing and many people are uncomfortable with it. Darolyn Jones, author of \"Collaborative Writing: Priority, Practice and Process\", says that many people work alone for several reasons. The first one is that many people cannot find time to meet with the rest of the group. Another reason is that each writer has their organization and own process of writing. When students are forced to work with others, they must adjust to the style of the group and get rid of their own. Many times there is a misunderstanding of what is expected of the students. The last reason, and the biggest one, is the fear of being criticized. Many writers do not feel comfortable sharing their work because they are afraid it will be torn down and disliked by readers and their audience.\n\nDespite these issues, there are several benefits to collaborative writing. Collaboration results in a stronger finished product. Each member can contribute their own strengths for the assignment. Working together allows students to mentor each other and practice working with one another, which will help them in the real world when they go out for their job. While the project may seem daunting, working together allows the burden to be shared and there are more eyes for editing the final project.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, new approaches to teaching writing emerged, as teachers realized that in order to be effective, a piece of writing should be tailored to a specific purpose and audience. Prominent among these was the British-based movement which came to be known as Writing Across the Curriculum. This approach rests on the premise that all teachers, not just language arts teachers, must be teachers of writing. Designed to ease the separation between literacy and content knowledge, this approach emphasizes the connection between writing and cognitive development, teaching students to write in a variety of genres, specific to purpose and discipline. Writing Across the Curriculum teachers often emphasize two basic pedagogical strands: Writing to Learn, informal writing done to prompt students to more deeply understand concepts; and Writing in the Disciplines, in which students are taught writing skills and conventions necessary to participate in specific academic discourse.\n\n\"Writing for understanding\", a 21st-century approach, adapts the principles of backward design to teach students to write effectively. Writing for Understanding grew out of a recognition that most students require explicit instruction in both the knowledge and the structures that they need to construct meaning in writing. Oral processing and the extensive use of models and modeling are core teaching methodologies in this approach. The Writing for Understanding Approach rests on three pillars: Backward Design, Understanding and Direct Instruction. Students are given focused, intentional instruction and practice in:\n\n\nWriting for understanding teachers intentionally design instruction to enable students to appropriately generalize and transfer their skills to multiple contexts. The Vermont Writing Collaborative serves as a clearinghouse for information about Writing for Understanding and provides professional development, instructional materials and support for educators.\n\nAccording to some writing theorists, reading for pleasure provides a more effective way of mastering the art of writing than does a formal study of writing, language, grammar, and vocabulary.\"Studies that sought to improve writing by providing reading experiences in place of grammar study or additional writing practice found that these experiences were as beneficial as, or more beneficial than, grammar study or extra writing practice.\"The apprenticeship approach provides one variant of the reading connection, arguing that the composition classroom should resemble pottery or piano workshops—minimizing dependence on excessive self-reflection, preoccupation with audience, and explicit rules. By watching the master, according to Michael Polanyi, an “apprentice unconsciously picks up the rules of the art, including those which are not explicitly known to the master himself.” Writing instructors, according to this approach, serve as models and coaches, providing explicit feedback in response to the learner's compositions. Students focus their attention on the task at hand, and not on \"an inaccessible and confusing multitude of explicit rules and strategies.\" \n\nIn 2009, the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) assumed the coordination of a state led effort called The Common Core State Standards Initiative. In this initiative, \"Governors and state commissioners of education from 48 states, 2 territories and the District of Columbia committed to developing a common core of state standards in English-language arts.\" The Common Core State Standards Initiative's focus, with regard to writing, is to prepare America's students for college and career writing. These standards indicate key points in English Language Arts Writing through outlining the following main categories: Text Types and Purposes; Production and Distribution of Writing; Research to Build and Present Knowledge; and Range of Writing. These main categories are divided into 10 concepts and skills which are introduced to students in Kindergarten and then built upon in every subsequent grade level. Complexity and rigor increase each year so students develop and master each concept and skill. This effort is ongoing and is certain to have a profound effect nationwide on writing curriculum and pedagogical practice over the next decade. The National Commission on Writing has challenged American public educators \"to teach all students to write effectively, clearly and thoughtfully.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4456711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4456711", "title": "The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs", "text": "The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs\n\n\"To kill the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs\" is an idiom used of an unprofitable action motivated by greed. It refers to one of Aesop's Fables, numbered 87 in the Perry Index, a story that also has a number of Eastern analogues. Many other stories contain geese that lay golden eggs though certain versions change them for hens that lay golden eggs.\n\nAvianus and Caxton tell different stories of a goose that lays a golden egg, where other versions have a hen, as in Townsend: \"A cottager and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every day. They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed [her]. Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen differed in no respect from their other hens. The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by day.\"\n\nIn early tellings, there is sometimes a commentary warning against greed rather than a pithy moral. This is so in Jean de La Fontaine's fable of \"La Poule aux oeufs d'or\" (Fables V.13), which begins with the sentiment that 'Greed loses all by striving all to gain' and comments at the end that the story can be applied to those who become poor by trying to outreach themselves. It is only later that the morals most often quoted today began to appear. These are 'Greed oft o’er reaches itself' (Joseph Jacobs, 1894) and 'Much wants more and loses all' (Samuel Croxall, 1722). It is notable also that these are stories told of a goose rather than a hen.\n\nThe English idiom \"Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg\", sometimes shortened to \"Killing the golden goose\", derives from this fable. It is generally used of a short-sighted action that destroys the profitability of an asset. Caxton's version of the story has the goose's owner demand that it lay two eggs a day; when it replied that it could not, the owner killed it. The same lesson is taught by Ignacy Krasicki's different fable of \"The Farmer:\"\nThere is another variant on the story, recorded by Syntipas (Perry Index 58) and appearing in Roger L'Estrange's 1692 telling as \"A Woman and a Fat Hen\" (Fable 87): \"A good Woman had a Hen that laid her every day an Egg. Now she fansy’d to her self, that upon a larger Allowance of Corn, this Hen might be brought in time to lay twice a day. She try’d the Experiment; but the Hen grew fat upon’t, and gave quite over laying\". His comment on this is that 'we should set Bounds to our Desires, and content our selves when we are well, for fear of losing what we had.' Another of Aesop's fables with the moral of wanting more and losing everything is \"The Dog and the Bone\".\n\nAn Eastern analogue is found in the \"Suvannahamsa Jataka\", which appears in the fourth section of the Buddhist book of monastic discipline (\"Vinaya\"). In this the father of a poor family is reborn as a swan with golden feathers and invites them to pluck and sell a single feather from his wings to support themselves, returning occasionally to allow them another. The greedy mother of the family eventually plucks all the feathers at once, but they then turn to ordinary feathers; when the swan recovers its feathers they too are no longer gold. The moral drawn there is:\n\nNorth of India, in the formerly Persian territory of Sogdiana, it was the Greek version of the story that was known. Among the 8th-century murals in Panjakent, in the western Sugdh province of Tajikistan, there is a panel from room 1, sector 21, representing a series of scenes moving from right to left where it is possible to recognize the same person first in the act of checking a golden egg and later killing the animal in order to get more eggs, only to understand the stupidity of his idea at the very end of the sequence. A local version of the story still persists in the area but ends differently with the main character eventually becoming a king.\n\nIn the \"Mahabharata\" a story is recounted of wild birds that spit gold, and were discovered by a man who soon strangled them \"out of greed\".\n\nThe French text was set as the fourth of ' \"Vijf fabels van La Fontaine\" for children’s choir and orchestra (Op. 25 1968). Yassen Vodenitcharov (1964-) has created a chamber opera from the story (2004).\n\nThe majority of illustrations of \"The Goose that laid the Golden Eggs\" picture the farmer despairing after discovering that he has killed the goose to no purpose. It was also one of several fables applied to political issues by the American illustrator Thomas Nast. Captioned \"Always killing the goose that lays the golden eggs\", it appeared in \"Harpers Weekly\" for March 16, 1878. There the picture of the baffled farmer, advised by a 'Communistic Statesman', referred to the rail strike of 1877.

Her most acclaimed novel is \"La Ruta de su Evasión\" (1948). Her 40 years of life were markedly divided into two phases: the first 20 years, filled with youth, beauty and happiness, contrasted sharply with the following years of tragedy, loneliness and sickness.\n\nYolanda Oreamuno was the only child of Carlos Oreamuno Pacheco and Margarita Unger Salazar. Her father died before her first birthday, so she was mainly raised by her maternal grandmother, Eudoxia Salazar Salazar, whose husband Unger was deceased by then. She obtained her secondary education in the Colegio Superior de Señoritas. She then studied bookkeeping and worked at the Costa Rican Post Office headquarters.\n\nAt the age of 20 she published her first two stories, \"La lagartija de la panza blanca\" and \"Para Revenar, no para Max Jiménez\".\n\nShe was working in the Chilean embassy when she met the diplomat Jorge Molina Wood. They were married, and moved to that country. She recounted life during that time in her stories \"La mareas vuelven de noche\" and \"Don Junvencio\" (which remained unpublished until 1971). Her time in Chile was prolific; her stories appeared in \"Repertorio Americano\", including \"40º sobre cero\", \"18 de setiembre\", \"Misa de ocho\", \"Vela urbana\", \"El espíritu de mi tierra\", \" Insomnio\" and \"El negro, sentido de la alegría\". Their marriage, however, fell apart in 1936; her husband, weakened by an incurable disease, committed suicide. She returned to Costa Rica at the end of 1936.\n\nIn 1937 she married a lawyer, Óscar Barahona Streber, who was involved with the Costa Rican communist movement. They both participated in opposition activities. Their son, Sergio Barahona Oreamuno, was born 8 December 1942. Their marriage did not last; after their divorce, her ex-husband migrated to Guatemala.\n\nShe wrote her first novel, \"Por tierra firme\", in 1938. In 1940 she submitted it to a writing contest, winning a three-way first prize. However, she declined to share the honor with the others, and decided against sending the manuscript for publication; eventually the manuscript was lost.\nOreamuno moved to Mexico, then decided to become a permanent Guatemalan citizen. However, by 1949 she was gravely ill, and she dwelt four months in a Washington D. C. hospital. She left the hospital to travel to Mexico City, to stay in the house of Costa Rican poet Eunice Odio. She died there in 1956. She was buried in a mausoleum in San Joaquín, D.F. In 1963 her remains were moved to San José. On the 55th anniversary of her death (8 July 2011), a commemorative plaque was installed over her tomb.\n\n\n\n\nHer most renowned novel is La Ruta de su Evasión (1948). Oreamuno draws on narrative techniques that were uncommon in other Costa Rican writers. It is believed that authors like Thomas Mann and Marcel Proust influenced her literary creation. Costa Rican critic Abelardo Bonilla wrote that \"In this as in all works of Yolanda Oreamuno there is boldness of conception and form, but there is a lack of internal unity\".\n\n"}
