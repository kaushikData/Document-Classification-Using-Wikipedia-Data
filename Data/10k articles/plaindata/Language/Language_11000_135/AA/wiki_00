This is particularly used in the representation of text in computer languages, which are generally stored in a tree structure as an abstract syntax tree. Abstract syntax, which only consists of the structure of data, is contrasted with concrete syntax, which also includes information about the representation. For example, concrete syntax includes features like parentheses (for grouping) or commas (for lists) which are not included in the abstract syntax, as they are implicit in the structure.\n\nAbstract syntaxes are classified as first-order abstract syntax (FOAS), if the structure is abstract but names (identifiers) are still concrete (and thus requires name resolution), and \"higher-order abstract syntax,\" if the names themselves are abstract.\n\nTo be implemented either for computation or communications, a mapping from the abstract syntax to specific machine representations and encodings must be defined; these may be called the \"concrete syntax\" (in language implementation) or the \"transfer syntax\" (in communications).\n\nA compiler's internal representation of a program will typically be specified by an abstract syntax in terms of categories such as \"statement\", \"expression\" and \"identifier\". This is independent of the source syntax (concrete syntax) of the language being compiled (though it will often be very similar). A parse tree is similar to an abstract syntax tree but it will typically also contain features such as parentheses which are syntactically significant but which are implicit in the structure of the abstract syntax tree.\n\nAlgebraic data types are particularly well-suited to the implementation of abstract syntax.\n\n"}

Unlike many universal language schemes of the period, it was meant merely as an auxiliary to—not a replacement of—existing natural languages.\n\nOne of the aims of the \"Essay\" was to provide a replacement for the Latin language, which had been the international language of scholars in Western Europe by then for 1000 years. Comenius and others interested in international languages had criticisms of the arbitrary features of Latin that made it harder to learn, and Wilkins also made such points. A scheme for a \"lingua franca\" based on numerical values had been published by John Pell (1630); and in his 1640 work \"Mercury or the Secret Messenger\" (1640) Wilkins had mentioned the possibility of developing a trade language.\n\nSeth Ward was author with Wilkins of \"Vindiciae academiarum\" (1654), a defence of the Commonwealth period of the Oxbridge university system against outsider reformers. In it Ward put forward a related language scheme, though differing from the \"Essay\" of Wilkins in some significant ways. Ward's ideas derived from a number of sources, such as Cyprian Kinner who was a follower of Comenius, Ramon Lull, and Georg Ritschel. They went on to influence George Dalgarno as well as Wilkins.\n\nThere was immediate interest in the \"Essay\"; Wilkins is said to have regarded his work only in terms of a proof of concept. But in the medium term enthusiasm for this kind of constructed language declined. The problem of a universal language remained as a topic of debate.\n\nThe stimulus for Wilkins to write the \"Essay\" came from the Council of the Royal Society, in 1662. The work was delayed by the Great Fire of London of 1666, which destroyed some of it in draft.\n\nThe book was written by Wilkins, assisted by John Ray, Francis Willughby, and others. An influence was the \"Ars Signorum\" of George Dalgarno. Also influential, as Wilkins acknowledged, was \"The Ground-Work or Foundation Laid ... for the Framing of a New Perfect Language\" (1652) by Francis Lodwick.\n\nThe work is in five parts, of which the fourth contains the discussion of the \"real character\" and \"philosophical language\". The third deals with \"philosophical grammar\" (universal grammar). The last part is the \"alphabetical dictionary\". It was compiled by William Lloyd.\n\nWilkin's \"Real Character\" is a constructed family of symbols, corresponding to a classification scheme developed by Wilkins and his colleagues. It was intended as a pasigraphy, in other words, to provide elementary building blocks from which could be constructed the universe's every possible thing and notion. The Real Character is not an orthography: i.e. it is not a written representation of spoken language. Instead, each symbol represents a concept directly, without (at least in the early parts of the \"Essay's\" presentation) there being any way of vocalizing it. Inspiration for this approach came in part from contemporary European accounts of the Chinese writing system, which were somewhat mistaken.\n\nLater in the \"Essay\" Wilkins introduces his \"Philosophical Language\", which assigns phonetic values to the Real Characters. For convenience, the following discussion blurs the distinction between Wilkins' Character and his Language.\n\nConcepts are divided into forty main \"Genera\", each of which gives the first, two-letter syllable of the word; a Genus is divided into \"Differences\", each of which adds another letter; and Differences are divided into \"Species\", which add a fourth letter. For instance, \"Zi\" identifies the Genus of \"beasts\" (mammals); \"Zit\" gives the Difference of \"rapacious beasts of the dog kind\"; \"Zitα\" gives the Species of dogs. (Sometimes the first letter indicates a supercategory—e.g. Z always indicates an animal—but this does not always hold.) The resulting Character, and its vocalization, for a given concept thus captures, to some extent, the concept's semantics.\n\nThe \"Essay\" also proposed ideas on weights and measure similar to those later found in the metric system.\nThe botanical section of the essay was contributed by John Ray;\nRobert Morison's criticism of Ray's work began a prolonged dispute between the two men.\n\nThe \"Essay\" has received a certain amount of academic and literary attention, usually casting it as brilliant but hopeless.\n\nOne criticism (among many) is that \"words expressing closely related ideas have almost the same form, differing perhaps by their last letter only...[I]t would be exceedingly difficult to remember all these minute distinctions, and confusion would arise, in rapid reading and particularly in conversation.\"\n\nGeorge Edmonds sought to improve Wilkins' Philosophical Language by reorganizing its grammar and orthography while keeping its taxonomy.\nMore recent \"a priori\" languages (among many others) are Solresol and Ro. \n\nJorge Luis Borges discusses Wilkins' philosophical language in his essay \"El idioma analítico de John Wilkins\" (\"The Analytical Language of John Wilkins\"), comparing Wilkins’ classification to the fictitious Chinese encyclopedia \"Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge\" and expressing doubts about any attempt at a universal classification.\n\nIn Neal Stephenson's \"Quicksilver\", character Daniel Waterhouse spends considerable time supporting the development of Wilkins' classification system. \n\n\n\n"}

It is not a defect of the ear or \"hearing\", but a neurological inability of the brain to process sound meaning. It is a disruption of the \"what\" pathway in the brain. Persons with auditory agnosia can physically hear the sounds and describe them using unrelated terms, but are unable to recognize them. They might describe the sound of some environmental sounds, such as a motor starting, as resembling a lion roaring, but would not be able to associate the sound with \"car\" or \"engine\", nor would they say that it \"was\" a lion creating the noise. Auditory agnosia is caused by damage to the secondary and tertiary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe of the brain.\n\nThere are three primary distinctions of auditory agnosia that fall into two categories.\n\nThis type of auditory agnosia is caused by lesions to the left hemisphere of the brain, specifically the temporal lobes and Wernicke's area.\n\n\"Linguistic (or verbal information or Wernicke's) agnosia\" indicates that the subject can't comprehend words, although they can understand words using sign language and words from reading books, and are themselves capable of speech (and even of deriving meaning from non-linguistic communication e.g. body language) the particular sounds associated to each word are meaningless.\n\nThis type of auditory agnosia is caused by lesions to the right hemisphere of the brain.\n\n\"Classical (or pure) auditory agnosia\" is an inability to process environmental sounds, such as animal noises, industrial noises, or the like. An airplane roaring overhead would not be understood to be related to the idea of \"airplane\"—indeed, the person would not even think to look up.\n\n\"Interpretive or receptive agnosia (amusia)\" is an inability to understand music. The term \"amusia\" covers a broad spectrum: from those with a mere deficit of rhythmic ability (mild dysrhythmia), to those with heavy all-encompassing amusia, including the recently coined \"distimbria\"; sufferers regard music as simply \"noise\", often compared to drainpipes or drills, or other invasive forms of background noise. Vocal singing can be understood, but is simply seen as \"odd tone of voice\". The standard is considered to be that amusics with a \"normal\" intensity of amusia are cortically unable to distinguish pitch changes of less than three semitones (when it includes a pitch-deficit; it is contentious whether without this symptom it can be considered amusia). They may appreciate or enjoy listening to or performing music, but some can not tolerate it or find it irritating.\n\nIn this test subjects are presented with two consecutive synthetic noises (usually with a two-second interval) and asked whether the noises are the same or different. Those with damage to the right hemisphere have significantly lower scores on this test than those of controls and those with left hemisphere damage.\n\nIn this test subjects are presented a natural sound followed by four pictures. The subject is then asked to point to the picture that best represents the sound they just heard. Those with damage to the left hemisphere do significantly poorer on this test than controls and those with right hemisphere damage.\n\nA seventy-four-year-old man named \"M\" had a special case of auditory agnosia. \"M\" had \"unilateral left posterior temporal and parietal damage\" (Saygin, Leech, & Dick, 2010, p. 107), including Wernicke's area. These areas of the brain are associated with language processing. He had a stroke when he was 62 and went through intensive speech therapy for twelve weeks to help him recover. He was able to regain his language capacity, but when tested at age 74, he had great difficulty in recognizing non-verbal environmental sounds. He did not have either verbal comprehension deficits nor peripheral hearing problems (p. 107). His condition was very rare because auditory agnosia for nonverbal sounds is usually associated with the right side of the brain. \"M\" was able to identify familiar Christmas songs and some animal sounds. When he heard music, he couldn't distinguish individual instruments or voices, but he knew it was music. fMRI scans show that after the stroke, his brain re-wired itself through neuronal compensation to account for the damage.\n\n\n"}

Peel island was settled in the early nineteenth century by speakers of eighteen European and Austronesian languages, including American English and Hawaiian.

The islanders became bilingual, and during the early twentieth century Bonin English incorporated elements of Japanese (Long 2007). Throughout the 20th century, most islanders used Bonin English at home. During the US occupation of 1946–68, the so-called \"Navy Generation\" learned American English at school. While Bonin English vocabulary skewed toward English during this period, a trend towards Japanese resumed after the occupation ended.

{"id": "2418429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2418429", "title": "Categorical proposition", "text": "Categorical proposition\n\nIn logic, a categorical proposition, or categorical statement, is a proposition that asserts or denies that all or some of the members of one category (the \"subject term\") are included in another (the \"predicate term\"). The study of arguments using categorical statements (i.e., syllogisms) forms an important branch of deductive reasoning that began with the Ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Ancient Greeks such as Aristotle identified four primary distinct types of categorical proposition and gave them standard forms (now often called \"A\", \"E\", \"I\", and \"O\"). If, abstractly, the subject category is named \"S\" and the predicate category is named \"P\", the four standard forms are:\nSurprisingly, a large number of sentences may be translated into one of these canonical forms while retaining all or most of the original meaning of the sentence. Greek investigations resulted in the so-called square of opposition, which codifies the logical relations among the different forms; for example, that an \"A\"-statement is contradictory to an \"O\"-statement; that is to say, for example, if one believes \"All apples are red fruits,\" one cannot simultaneously believe that \"Some apples are not red fruits.\" Thus the relationships of the square of opposition may allow immediate inference, whereby the truth or falsity of one of the forms may follow directly from the truth or falsity of a statement in another form.\n\nModern understanding of categorical propositions (originating with the mid-19th century work of George Boole) requires one to consider if the subject category may be empty. If so, this is called the \"hypothetical viewpoint\", in opposition to the \"existential viewpoint\" which requires the subject category to have at least one member. The existential viewpoint is a stronger stance than the hypothetical and, when it is appropriate to take, it allows one to deduce more results than otherwise could be made. The hypothetical viewpoint, being the weaker view, has the effect of removing some of the relations present in the traditional square of opposition.\n\nArguments consisting of three categorical propositions — two as premises and one as conclusion — are known as categorical syllogisms and were of paramount importance from the times of ancient Greek logicians through the Middle Ages. Although formal arguments using categorical syllogisms have largely given way to the increased expressive power of modern logic systems like the first-order predicate calculus, they still retain practical value in addition to their historic and pedagogical significance.\n\nSentences in natural language may be translated into standard form. In each row of the following chart, \"S\" corresponds to the subject of the example sentence, and \"P\" corresponds to the predicate.\n\nNote that \"All \"S\" is not \"P\"\" (e.g., \"All cats do not have eight legs\") is not classified as an example of standard form. This is because the translation to natural language is ambiguous. In common speech, the sentence \"All cats do not have eight legs\" could be used informally to indicate either (1) \"At least some, and perhaps all, cats do not have eight legs\" or (2) \"No cats have eight legs\".\n\nCategorical propositions can be categorized into four types on the basis of their \"quality\" and \"quantity\", or their \"distribution of terms\". These four types have long been named \"A\", \"E\", \"I\", and \"O\". This is based on the Latin ' (I affirm), referring to the affirmative propositions \"A\" and \"I\", and ' (I deny), referring to the negative propositions \"E\" and \"O\".\n\nQuantity refers to the number of members of the subject class that are used in the proposition. If the proposition refers to all members of the subject class, it is \"universal\". If the proposition does not employ all members of the subject class, it is \"particular\". For instance, an \"I\"-proposition (\"Some \"S\" is \"P\"\") is particular since it only refers to some of the members of the subject class.\n\nQuality It is described as whether the proposition affirms or denies the inclusion of a subject within the class of the predicate. The two possible qualities are called \"affirmative\" and \"negative\". For instance, an \"A\"-proposition (\"All \"S\" is \"P\"\") is affirmative since it states that the subject is contained within the predicate. On the other hand, an \"O\"-proposition (\"Some \"S\" is not \"P\"\") is negative since it excludes the subject from the predicate.\n\nAn important consideration is the definition of the word \"some\". In logic, \"some\" refers to \"one or more\", which could mean \"all\". Therefore, the statement \"Some S is P\" does not guarantee that the statement \"Some S is not P\" is also true.\n\nThe two terms (subject and predicate) in a categorical proposition may each be classified as distributed or undistributed. If all members of the term's class are affected by the proposition, that class is \"distributed\"; otherwise it is \"undistributed\". Every proposition therefore has one of four possible \"distribution of terms\".\n\nEach of the four canonical forms will be examined in turn regarding its distribution of terms. Although not developed here, Venn diagrams are sometimes helpful when trying to understand the distribution of terms for the four forms.\n\nAn \"A\"-proposition distributes the subject to the predicate, but not the reverse. Consider the following categorical proposition: \"All dogs are mammals\". All dogs are indeed mammals, but it would be false to say all mammals are dogs. Since all dogs are included in the class of mammals, \"dogs\" is said to be distributed to \"mammals\". Since all mammals are not necessarily dogs, \"mammals\" is undistributed to \"dogs\".\n\nAn \"E\"-proposition distributes bidirectionally between the subject and predicate. From the categorical proposition \"No beetles are mammals\", we can infer that no mammals are beetles. Since all beetles are defined not to be mammals, and all mammals are defined not to be beetles, both classes are distributed.\n\nBoth terms in an \"I\"-proposition are undistributed. For example, \"Some Americans are conservatives\". Neither term can be entirely distributed to the other. From this proposition, it is not possible to say that all Americans are conservatives or that all conservatives are Americans.\n\nIn an \"O\"-proposition, only the predicate is distributed. Consider the following: \"Some politicians are not corrupt\". Since not all politicians are defined by this rule, the subject is undistributed. The predicate, though, is distributed because all the members of \"corrupt people\" will not match the group of people defined as \"some politicians\". Since the rule applies to every member of the corrupt people group, namely, \"All corrupt people are not some politicians\", the predicate is distributed.\n\nThe distribution of the predicate in an \"O\"-proposition is often confusing due to its ambiguity. When a statement such as \"Some politicians are not corrupt\" is said to distribute the \"corrupt people\" group to \"some politicians\", the information seems of little value, since the group \"some politicians\" is not defined. But if, as an example, this group of \"some politicians\" were defined to contain a single person, Albert, the relationship becomes clearer. The statement would then mean that, of every entry listed in the corrupt people group, not one of them will be Albert: \"All corrupt people are not Albert\". This is a definition that applies to every member of the \"corrupt people\" group, and is, therefore, distributed.\n\nIn short, for the subject to be distributed, the statement must be universal (e.g., \"all\", \"no\"). For the predicate to be distributed, the statement must be negative (e.g., \"no\", \"not\").\n\nPeter Geach and others have criticized the use of distribution to determine the validity of an argument. It has been suggested that statements of the form \"Some A are not B\" would be less problematic if stated as \"Not every A is B,\" which is perhaps a closer translation to Aristotle's original form for this type of statement.\n\nThere are several operations (e.g., conversion, obversion, and contraposition) that can be performed on a categorical statement to change it into another. The new statement may or may not be equivalent to the original. [In the following tables that illustrate such operations, rows with equivalent statement shall be marked in green, while those with inequivalent statements shall be marked in red.]\n\nSome operations require the notion of the \"class complement\". This refers to every element under consideration which is \"not\" an element of the class. Class complements are very similar to set complements. The class complement of a set P will be called \"non-P\".\n\nThe simplest operation is conversion where the subject and predicate terms are interchanged. \n\nFrom a statement in \"E\" or \"I\" form, it is valid to conclude its converse. This is not the case for the \"A\" and \"O\" forms.\n\nObversion changes the \"quality\" (that is the affirmativity or negativity) of the statement and the predicate term. For example, a universal affirmative statement would become a universal negative statement.\n\nCategorical statements are logically equivalent to their obverse. As such, a Venn diagram illustrating any one of the forms would be identical to the Venn diagram illustrating its obverse.\n\n\n\n"}

Throughout the entire exhibition tour, a reversal of roles is created: hearing visitors lose their usual routines of articulating themselves and discover a new repertoire of non-verbal expression. They experience a different openness and empathy towards \"the other\".\n\nIn 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 278 million people worldwide having moderate to profound hearing loss in both ears or are born deaf. \n\n\"The impact of hearing impairment on a child's speech, language, education and social integration depends on the level and type of hearing impairment, and the age of onset, especially if it begins before the age when speech normally develops.\" \nThe prototype of Dialogue in Silence was called “Schattensprache”. Focusing on silent communication it was presented for the first time 1998 in Frankfurt. Orna Cohen and Andreas Heinecke then developed this model further into the large exhibition format of today. In 2003 they introduced the new concept with great success to the public in Paris at the “Cité des Sciences et l’Industrie”. In 2006 the exhibition was established as first permanent exhibition at the Children’s Museum in Holon, Israel. In 2008 and 2009 Mexico hosted the exhibition at the Children Museum in Papalote. In Germany, the Museum für Kommunikation in Frankfurt presented the exhibition in 2010 and 2011. So did the DASA Museum in Dortmund in 2009. In September 2014 Dialogue in Silence became the second permanent exhibition at the Dialoghaus in Hamburg, next to Dialogue in the Dark. In 2015, the exhibition Dialogue in Silence also became a permanent exhibition in Istanbul, Turkey. In August 2017, a 30-days-trial will run in Japan, preparing for a longer exhibition in 2020.\n\nCorporate learning workshops are offered as a spin off from the actual exhibition. All Dialogue in Silence exhibitions and corporate learning workshops are handled by Dialogue Social Enterprise GmbH, Hamburg.\n\n»Dialogue in Silence« is an exhibition that invites visitors into a world of silence. Different forms of expression are used here and language must be visible in order to be understood. Hearing-impaired guides lead visitors through the exhibition, which is totally soundproof. It is the encounter which lies at the heart of the experience. At the same time, a reversal of roles is created: hearing people are torn out of social routine and familiar perception. They discover their repertoire of non-verbal expression in order to communicate creatively by gestures and body language. Hearing-impaired people, who by virtue of their experience and ability to sign are more competent, support the visitors and become ambassadors of a world without sound which is no way poorer – but different.\n\nThe exhibition consists of a series of circular rooms dedicated to different aspects of non-verbal communication. All walls are specially constructed with a fabric absorbing sound to the best of effects, while providing a monochromatic background.

{"id": "45099781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45099781", "title": "Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus", "text": "Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus\n\nThe Hindus of the Kashmir Valley, a large majority of whom were Kashmiri Pandits, were forced to flee the Kashmir valley as a result of being targeted by JKLF and Islamic insurgents during late 1989 and early 1990. Of the approximately 300,000 to 600,000 Hindus living in the Kashmir Valley in 1990 only 2,000–3,000 remain there in 2016.\n\nAccording to the Indian government, more than 62,000 families are registered as Kashmiri refugees including some Sikh families. Most families were resettled in Jammu, National Capital Region surrounding Delhi and other neighbouring states.\n\nUnder the 1975 accord, Sheikh Abdullah agreed to measures previously undertaken by the central government in Jammu and Kashmir to integrate the state into India. Sociologist Farrukh Faheem states that it was met with of hostility among people of Kashmir and laid the groundwork for the future insurgency. Those opposed to it included Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir and People's League in Indian Jammu and Kashmir, and Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) based in Azad Kashmir. Since the mid-1970s, communalist rhetoric was being exploited in the state for votebank politics. This fit together with the plan of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) which was trying to Islamise Kashmir and replace its prevalent Sufi culture with Wahhabism in order to create an atmosphere of religious unity with Pakistan.\n\nISI's initial attempts to create unrest in Kashmir against the Indian government were unsuccessful until it started growing in late-1980s. The Afghan jihad against the Soviets, the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the armed struggle of the Sikhs in Punjab against the Indian state became sources of inspiration for large numbers of Kashmiri Muslim youth. Both the pro-Independence JKLF and the pro-Pakistan Islamist groups including Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir mobilised the fast growing anti-Indian sentiments among the Kashmiri population. The year of 1984 saw a pronounced rise in terrorist violence in Kashmir. When the JKLF militant Maqbool Bhat was executed in February 1984, strikes and protests by Kashmiri nationalists broke out in the region, where large number of Kashmiri youth participated in widespread anti-India demonstrations, which faced heavy handed reprisals by the state forces.\n\nCritics of the then Chief Minister, Farooq Abdullah, charged that Abdullah was losing control. His visit to Pakistan administered Kashmir during then became an embarrassment, where according to Hashim Qureshi, he shared a platform with JKLF . Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of Indira Gandhi and his father, so that sentiments there could \"be known first hand\", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed Khalistan terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On July 2, 1984, G. M. Shah, who had support from Indira Gandhi, replaced his brother-in-law Farooq Abdullah and became the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, after Abdullah was dismissed, in what was termed as a political \"coup\". \n\nG. M. Shah's administration, which did not have people's mandate, turned to Islamists and opponents of India, notably the Molvi Iftikhar Hussain Ansari, Mohammad Shafi Qureshi and Mohinuddin Salati, to gain some legitimacy through religious sentiments. This gave political space to Islamists who previously lost overwhelmingly in the 1983 state elections. In 1986, Shah decided to construct a mosque within the premises of an ancient Hindu temple inside the New Civil Secretariat area in Jammu to be made available to the Muslim employees for 'Namaz'. People of Jammu took to streets to protest against this decision, which led to a Hindu-Muslim clash. In February 1986, Gul Shah on his return to Kashmir valley retaliated and incited the Kashmiri Muslims by saying \"Islam khatrey mein hey\" (trans. Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Pandits were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged. An investigation of Anantnag riots revealed that members of the 'secular parties' in the state, rather than the Islamists, had played a key role in organising the violence to gain political mileage through religious sentiments. Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on March 12, 1986, by the then Governor Jagmohan following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly. The political fight was hence being portrayed as a conflict between \"Hindu\" New Delhi (Central Government), and its efforts to impose its will in the state, and \"Muslim\" Kashmir, represented by political Islamists and clerics.\n\nThe Islamists had organised under a banner named Muslim United Front, with manifesto to work for Islamic unity and against political interference from the centre, and contested the 1987 state elections, in which they lost again. However, the 1987 elections were widely believed to be rigged so as to bring the secular parties (NC and INC) in Kashmir at the forefront, and this caused the insurgency in Kashmir. The Kashmiri militants killed anyone who openly expressed pro-India policies. Kashmiri Pandits were targeted specifically because they were seen as presenting Indian presence in Kashmir because of their faith. Though the insurgency had been launched by JKLF, groups rose over the next few months advocating for establishment of \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\" (Rule of Allah). The Islamist groups proclaimed the Islamicisation of socio-political and economic set-up, merger with Pakistan, unification of \"ummah\" and establishment of an \"Islamic Caliphate\". Liquidation of central government officials, Pandits, liberal and nationalist intellectuals, social and cultural activists was described as necessary to rid the valley of un-Islamic elements. The relations among the semi-secular and Islamists groups were generally poor and often hostile. The JKLF had also utilized Islamic formulations in its mobilization strategies and public discourse, using Islam and independence interchangeably. It demanded equal rights for everyone however this had a distinct Islamic flavor as it sought to establish an Islamic democracy, protection of minority rights per Quran and Sunnah and an economy of Islamic socialism. The pro-separatist political practices at times deviated from their stated secular position.\n\nIn July 1988, the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) began a separatist insurgency for independence of Kashmir from India. The group targeted a Kashmiri Hindu for the first time on September 14, 1989, when they killed Pandit Tika Lal Taploo, an advocate and a prominent leader of Bharatiya Janata Party in Jammu & Kashmir in front of several eyewitnesses. This instilled fear in the Kashmiri Pandit community especially as Taploo's killers were never caught which also emboldened the terrorists. The Pandits felt that they weren't safe in the valley and could be targeted any time. The killings of Kashmiri Hindus continued that included many of the prominent ones. On January 4, 1990, a local Urdu newspaper, \"Aftab\", published a press release issued by Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, asking all Pandits to leave the Valley immediately. Another local paper, \"Al Safa\", repeated this expulsion order. Explosive and inflammatory speeches were broadcast from the public address systems of the mosques frequently. The sense of vulnerabity and insecurity was exacerbated by attacks on prominent Hindu politicians, postings of hit lists with names of specific Hindu individuals and various violent episodes in Srinagar and other places.\n\nIn order to undermine his political rival Farooq Abdullah who at that time was the Chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, the Minister of Home Affairs Mufti Mohammad Sayeed convinced Prime Minister V.P. Singh to appoint Jagmohan as the governor of the state. Abdullah resented Jagmohan who had been appointed as the governor earlier in April 1984 as well and had recommended Abdullah's dismissal to Rajiv Gandhi in July 1984. Mufti was convinced that such a move will irritate Abdullah and make him quit. Abdullah had earlier declared that he would resign if Jagmohan was made the Governor. However, the Central government went ahead and appointed him as Governor on 19 January 1990. In response, Abdullah resigned on the same day and Jagmohan suggested the dissolution of the State Assembly. On 21 January 1990, two days after Jagmohan took over as governor, the Gawkadal massacre took place in Srinagar, in which the Indian security forces had opened fire on protesters, leading to the death of at least 50 people, and likely over 100. These events led to chaos. Lawlessness took over the valley and the crowd with slogans and guns started roaming around the streets. News kept coming of violent incidents and those Hindus who survived the night saved their lives by traveling out of the valley.\n\nMost of the Kashmiri Hindus left Kashmir valley and moved to other parts of the country, majorly to the refugee camps in Jammu region of the state.\n\nOn September 14, 1989, Pandit Tika Lal Taploo, who was a lawyer and a BJP member, was murdered by the JKLF in his home in Srinagar. Soon after Taploo's death, Nilkanth Ganjoo, a judge of Srinagar High court who had sentenced Maqbul Bhat to death, was shot dead. In December 1989, members of JKLF kidnapped Dr. Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of the-then Union Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed demanding release of five militants, which was subsequently fulfilled.\n\nOn January 04, 1990, Srinagar based newspaper \"Aftab\" released a message, threatening all Hindus to leave Kashmir immediately, sourcing it to the militant organization Hizbul Mujahideen. On 14th April 1990, another Srinagar based newspaper named \"Al-safa\" republished the same warning. The outfit though did not own the statement and subsequently issued a clarification. Walls were pasted with posters with threatening messages to all Kashmiris to harshly follow the Islamic rules which included abidance by the Islamic dress code, a prohibition on alcohol, cinemas, and video parlors and strict restrictions on Kashmiri women. Unknown masked men with Kalashnikovs used to force people to reset their time to Pakistan Standard Time. All offices buildings, shops, and establishments were colored green as a sign of Islamic rule. Shops, factories, temples and homes of Kashmiri Hindus were burned or destroyed. Threatening posters were posted on doors of Hindus asking them to leave Kashmir immediately. During the middle of the night of 18th and 19th January, a blackout took place in the Kashmir Valley where electricity was cut except in mosques which broadcast divisive and inflammatory messages, asking for a purge of Kashmiri pundits.\n\nOn 29 April, 1990, Sarwanand Kaul Premi, a veteran Kashmiri poet was gruesomely murdered. Several intelligence operatives were assassinated, over the course of January. On February 2, 1990, Satish Tikoo, a young Hindu Pandit social-worker was murdered near his own house in Habba Kadal, Srinagar. On February 13th, 1990, Lassa Kaul, Station Director of Srinagar Doordarshan, was shot dead. Many Kashmiri Hindu women were kidnapped, raped and murdered, throughout the time of exodus.\n\nHriday Nath Wanchoo, a trade union leader and human rights activist, was murdered in December 1992 with Ashiq Hussain Faktoo being convicted for the murder.\n\nThe militancy in Kashmir had increased after the exodus. The militants had targeted the properties of Kashmiri Pandits after their exodus. In 2009 Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to recognise 14 September 2007, as Martyrs Day to acknowledge ethnic cleansing and campaigns of terror inflicted on non-Muslim minorities of Jammu and Kashmir by militant seeking to establish an Islamic state.\n\nKashmiri Hindus continue to fight for their return to the valley and many of them live as refugees. The exiled community had hoped to return after the situation improved. They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Pandit families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Pandits faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Pandits to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question. Later the Indian Government has taken up the issue of education of the displaced students from Kashmir, and helped them get admissions in various Kendriya Vidyalayas and major educational institutions & universities across the country. In 2010, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir noted that 808 Pandit families, comprising 3,445 people, were still living in the Valley and that financial and other incentives put in place to encourage others to return there had been unsuccessful. According to a Jammu and Kashmir government report, 219 members of the Pandit community out of total 1400 Hindus, had been killed in the region between 1989 and 2004 but none thereafter.\n\nThe local organisation of Pandits in Kashmir, Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti (KPSS) after carrying out a survey in 2008 and 2009, said that 399 Kashmiri Pandits were killed by insurgents from 1990 to 2011 with 75% of them being killed during the first year of the Kashmiri insurgency, and that during the last 20 years, about 650 Pandits have been killed in the valley. Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, estimates 357 pandits were killed in Kashmir in 1990. \n\nPanun Kashmir, a political group representing the Pandits who fled Kashmir, has published a list of about 1,341 Pandits killed since 1990. An organisation called Roots of Kashmir filed a petition in 2017 to reopen 215 cases of more than 700 alleged murders of Kashmiri Pandits, however the Supreme Court of India refused its plea.\n\nWhilst some Pandit organisations such as Panun Kashmir etc. have accused Kashmiri Muslims of genocide and mass-rape, during the times of exodus, authors have labeled the claims as \"exaggerated\". Scholars Mridu Rai and A. Evans have outright rejected the claims of genocide.\n\nSome scholars have also accused the Indian state and Media of utilizing the experience of Pandits as a tool of propaganda. In February 1993, a notable Indian magazine launched an investigation upon a list of 23 shrines provided by Bharatiya Janata Party and found that the claims of alleged desecration of scores of Hindu shrines in Kashmir, widely perpetuated by the Indian media and right-wing Hindu politicians, were \"false\".\n\nFurther, whilst significantly higher figures of death, in thousands, have been reported by certain Pandit-organisations, scholars have rejected the claims, instead choosing to roughly rely upon the official figures. According to the government of Jammu and Kashmir 219 Kashmiri Pandits were killed and 24,202 families migrated out of the valley.\n\nThe Indian Government has tried to rehabilitate the Pandits and the separatists have also invited the Pandits back to Kashmir. Tahir, the commander of a separatist Islamic group, ensured full protection to the Kashmiri Pandits.\n\nThe apathy on the part of the government and the sufferings of the Kashmiri Pandits have been highlighted in a play titled 'Kaash Kashmir'. Such efforts or claims have lacked political will as journalist Rahul Pandita writes in a memoir.\n\nSome consider Article 370 as a roadblock in the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandits as the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir does not allow those living in India outside Jammu and Kashmir to freely settle in the state and become its citizens.\n\nSanjay Tickoo, president of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), says that the 'Article 370' affair is different from the issue of exodus of Kashmiri Hindus and both should be dealt with separately. He remarks that, linking both the affairs is an \"utterly insensitive way to deal with a highly sensitive and emotive issue\".\n\nAs of 2016, a total of 1,800 Kashmiri Pandit youths have returned to the Valley since the announcing of Rs. 1,168-crore package in 2008 by the UPA government. R.K. Bhat, president of Youth All India Kashmiri Samaj criticised the package to be a mere eyewash and claimed that most of the youths were living in cramped prefabricated sheds or in rented accommodation. He also said that 4,000 vacancies have been lying vacant since 2010 and alleged that the BJP government was repeating the same rhetoric and was not serious about helping them. In an interview with NDTV on January 19, Farooq Abdullah commented that the onus was on Kashmiri Pandits to come back themselves and nobody would beg them to do so. His comments were met with disagreement by Kashmiri Pandit authors Neeru Kaul, Siddhartha Gigoo, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and retired General Syed Ata Hasnain. He also said that during his tenure as Chief Minister in 1996, he had asked them to return but they refused to do so. He reiterated his comments on January 23 and said that the time had come for them to return.\n\nThe issue of separate townships for Kashmiri Pandits has been a source of contention in Kashmir with separatists as well as mainstream political parties opposing it. Hizbul Mujahideen militant, Burhan Muzaffar Wani, had threatened of attacking the \"Pandit composite townships\" which were meant to be built for the rehabilitation of the non-Muslim community. In a 6-minute long video clip, Wani described the rehabilitation scheme as resembling Israeli designs.\n\nHowever, Burhan Wani welcomed the Kashmiri Pandits to return and promised to guard them. He also promised a safe Amarnath Yatra. Kashmiri Pandits residing in the Valley also mourned Burhan Wani's death. Burhan Wani's successor in the Hizbul Mujahideen, Zakir Rashid Bhat, also asked the Kashmiri Pandits to return and ensured them protection.\n\nDuring the 2016 Kashmir unrest, transit camps housing Kashmir Pandits in Kashmir were attacked by mobs. About 200–300 Kashmiri Pandit employees fled the transit camps in Kashmir during night time on 12 July due to the attacks by protesters on the camps and have held protests against the government for attacks on their camp and demanded that all Kashmiri Pandit employees in Kashmir valley be evacuated immediately. Over 1300 government employees belonging to the community have fled the region during the unrest. Posters threatening the Pandits to leave Kashmir or be killed were put up near transit camps in Pulwama allegedly by the militant organisation Lashkar-e-Islam. There were doubts as to who put up the poster with speculations being raised as to whether other groups had put up the poster using the name of Lashkar-e-Islam.\n\nThe employment package was also extended to Pandits who did not migrate out of the valley with an amendment to \"J&K Migrants (Special Drive) Recruitment Rules, 2009\" in October 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1935496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935496", "title": "Film poster", "text": "Film poster\n\nA film poster is a poster used to promote and advertise a film. Studios often print several posters that vary in size and content for various domestic and international markets. They normally contain an image with text. Today's posters often feature photographs of the main actors. Prior to the 1980s, illustrations instead of photos were far more common. The text on film posters usually contains the film title in large lettering and often the names of the main actors. It may also include a tagline, the name of the director, names of characters, the release date, etc.\n\nFilm posters are displayed inside and on the outside of movie theaters, and elsewhere on the street or in shops. The same images appear in the film exhibitor's pressbook and may also be used on websites, DVD (and historically VHS) packaging, flyers, advertisements in newspapers and magazines, etc.\n\nFilm posters have been used since the earliest public exhibitions of film. They began as outside placards listing the programme of (short) films to be shown inside the hall or movie theater. By the early 1900s, they began to feature illustrations of a film scene or an array of overlaid images from several scenes. Other posters have used artistic interpretations of a scene or even the theme of the film, represented in a wide variety of artistic styles.\n\nThe first film poster was based on an illustration by Marcellin Auzolle to promote the showing of the Lumiere Brothers film \"L'Arroseur arrosé\" at the Grand Café in Paris on December 26, 1895.\n\nOriginally, film posters were produced for the exclusive use by the theaters exhibiting the film the poster was created for, and were required to be returned to the distributor after the film left the theater. In the United States, film posters were usually returned to a nationwide operation called the National Screen Service (NSS) which printed and distributed most of the film posters for the studios between 1940 and 1984. As an economy measure, the NSS regularly recycled posters that were returned, sending them back out to be used again at another theater. During this time, a film could stay in circulation for several years, and so many old film posters were badly worn before being retired into storage at an NSS warehouse (most often, they were thrown away when they were no longer needed or had become too worn to be used again). Those posters which were not returned were often thrown away by the theater owner or damaged by being outside.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the American film studios began taking over direct production and distribution of their posters from the National Screen Service and the process of making and distributing film posters became decentralized in that country.\n\nAfter the National Screen Service ceased most of its printing and distribution operations in 1985, some of the posters which they had stored in warehouses around the United States ended up in the hands of private collectors and dealers. Today there is a thriving collectibles market in film posters; some have become very valuable. The first auction by a major auction house solely of film posters occurred on December 11, 1990, when proceeds of a sale of 271 vintage posters run by Bruce Hershenson at Christie's totaled US $935,000. The record price for a single poster was set on November 15, 2005 when $690,000 was paid for a poster of Fritz Lang's 1927 film \"Metropolis\" from the Reel Poster Gallery in London. Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring extremely high prices as well, with an example from \"The Mummy\" realizing $452,000 in a 1997 Sotheby's auction, and posters from both \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and \"The Black Cat\" selling for $334,600 in Heritage auctions, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.\nOccasionally, rare film posters have been found being used as insulation in attics and walls. In 2011, 33 film posters, including a \"Dracula\" Style F one-sheet (shown right), from 1930-1931 were discovered in an attic in Berwick, Pennsylvania and auctioned for $502,000 in March 2012 by Heritage Auctions.\n\nOver the years, old Bollywood posters, especially with hand-painted art, have become collectors items.\n\nAs a result of market demand, some of the more popular older film posters have been reproduced either under license or illegally. Although the artwork on reproductions is the same as originals, reproductions can often be distinguished by size, printing quality, and paper type. Several websites on the Internet offer \"authentication\" tests to distinguish originals from reproductions.\n\nOriginal film posters distributed to theaters and other poster venues (such as bus stops) by the movie studios are never sold directly to the public. However, most modern posters are produced in large quantities and often become available for purchase by collectors indirectly through various secondary markets such as eBay. Accordingly, most modern posters are not as valuable. However some recent posters, such as the \"Pulp Fiction\" \"Lucky Strike\" U.S. one sheet poster (recalled due to a dispute with the cigarette company), are quite rare.\n\nLobby cards are similar to posters but smaller, usually , also before 1930. Lobby cards are collectible and values depend on their age, quality, and popularity. Typically issued in sets of eight, each featuring a different scene from the film. In unusual circumstances, some releases were promoted with larger (12 cards) or smaller sets (6 cards). The set for \"The Running Man\" (1963), for example, had only six cards, whereas the set for \"The Italian Job\" (1969) had twelve. Films released by major production companies experiencing financial difficulties often lacked lobby sets, such as \"Manhunter\" (1986).\n\nA Jumbo Lobby Card is larger, 14 in x 17 in (36 cm x 45 cm) and also issued in sets. Prior to 1940 studios promoted major releases with the larger card sets. In addition to the larger size, the paper quality was better (glossy or linen). The title card displays the movie title and top stars prominently.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, sets of lobby cards are known as \"Front of House\" cards. These, however, also refer to black-and-white press photographs, in addition to the more typical 8 × 10 inch promotional devices resembling lobby cards.\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University holds a collection of lobby cards from silent western films that date between 1910 and 1930.\n\nA teaser poster or advance poster is an early promotional film poster, containing a basic image or design without revealing too much information such as the plot, theme, and characters. The purpose is to incite awareness and generate hype for the film. A tagline may be included. There are some instances when teaser posters are issued long in advance before the film goes into production (teasers for cancelled projects are historically informative), although they are issued during the film development. Notable styles for teaser poster include:\n\nFor a film with an ensemble cast there may be a set of character posters, each featuring an individual character from the film. Usually it contains the name of the actor or the name of the character played. It may also include a tagline that reflects the quality of the character.\n\nFilm posters come in different sizes and styles depending on the country. The most common are listed below.\n\n\nThe following sizes were in common use in the United States prior to the mid-1980s, but have since been phased out of production:\n\n\n\n\nThe \"billing block\" is the list of names that adorn the bottom portion of the official poster (or 'one sheet', as it is called in the movie industry) of the movie\". A billing block can be seen at the bottom of Reynold Brown's poster from \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\" (1958), which is reproduced below. In the layout of film posters and other film advertising copy, the billing block is usually set in a highly condensed typeface (one in which the height of characters is several times the width). By convention, the point size of the billing block is 25 or 35 percent of the average height of each letter in the title logo. Inclusion in the credits and the billing block is generally a matter of detailed contracts between the artists and the producer. Using a condensed typeface allows the heights of the characters to meet contractual constraints while still allowing enough horizontal space to include all the required text.\n\nNormally, the artist is not identified on the film poster and, in many cases, the artist is anonymous. However, several artists have become well known because of their outstanding illustrations on film posters. Some artists, such as Drew Struzan, often sign their poster artwork and the signature is included on distributed posters.\n\n\nThe annual Key Art Awards, sponsored by \"The Hollywood Reporter\", include awards for best film poster in the categories of comedy, drama, action adventure, teaser, and international film. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" defines the term \"key art\" as \"the singular, iconographic image that is the foundation upon which a movie's marketing campaign is built.\" In 2006, the original poster for \"The Silence of the Lambs\" was named best film poster \"of the past 35 years\".\n\n"}

In 2001, Marinaj founded the Albanian-American Writers Association and served as president until 2009.\n\nWhile pursuing his new life in America, Marinaj continued working as a freelance journalist for the Albanian media; his freelance work included interviews with President George Herbert Walker Bush, the ninth and current President of the State of Israel Shimon Peres, and world-renowned soccer player Pelé.\n\nMarinaj published his poem entitled \"Horses\" in the Albanian paper of record, \"Drita\", which at first glance it read like a simple poem about farm animals, but was actually a satirical social and political commentary about the Albanian people being herded and corralled by an oppressive communist regime. \"Horses\" appeared in \"Drita\" on August 19, 1990, and the response was immediate and overwhelming. The sheer audacity of publishing such a clearly subversive poem in a national publication amazed the Albanians (and soon after the international community as well). \" Within hours, copies of \"Drita sold\" out across the country, so people took to scrawling the poem on scraps of paper and passing it to one another in the subways and on the streets and months later, protesters chanted the poem through megaphones during anti-government demonstrations. Seen from this point of view, \"Marinaj's words inspired freedom, helped defeat communism in Albania.\" Nevertheless, \"having seen other poets hanged in the city's center for voicing similar notions of freedom and liberty, Marinaj knew that he had to leave the country immediately; packed a few of his favorite books, told his friends and family that he was going on vacation, and set off on an eight-hour hike over the mountains and into Yugoslavia.\"\n\nAfter his education in Albania, Marinaj earned an associate degree in science from Brookhaven College, in 2001. He continued his education at the University of Texas at Dallas where he graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2006 with a bachelor's in literary studies, and a master's degree in the same subject in 2008. Three years later, he received a certificate in Holocaust Studies from the Ackerman Center for Holocaust Studies.\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas awarded Marinaj a PhD in 2012. His dissertation which focus on the history and philosophy of oral poetry in the Balkans and on the Translation Theory is titled \"Oral Poetry in Albanian and Other Balkan Cultures: Translating the Labyrinths of Untranslatability\".\n\nAccording to The Dallas Morning News, Marinaj's \"Protonism Theory\" seeks to \"promote peace and positive thinking\" through literary criticism. Protonism Theory proposes that there are strong and weak points in every piece of literature but argues that a critic's personal interests and biases influence how much focus those points receive. Marinaj founded the Protonism Theory in 2005 as a response to the flood of unduly negative criticism in East European academia following the collapse of communism and as a response, he developed Protonism to provide a common ground from which critics could evaluate a literary work more objectively. Protonism works along five central principles: truth, inquiry, restitution, protonismiotics, and ethics.\n\nMarinaj teaches English and Communications, among other courses, at Richland College, since 2001.\n\nMarinaj has published several books of poetry, journalism, and literary criticism. His three books of poetry include (\"Do Not Depart From Me\"), (\"Infinite\"), and (\"Prayer on the Eighth Day of the Week\"). In addition, he has published a book of author interviews titled (\"The Other Side of the Mirror\"), a book of selected articles and essays titled (\"Some things can't be kept secret\"), and one book of literary criticism titled (\"Protonism: theory into practice\").\n\nMarinaj, who has served as guest editor of the Translation Review, has translated several books from English to Albanian, and two from Albanian to English, including a collection of Albanian oral epic poetry (with Frederick Turner) and has edited more than a dozen books in both languages.\n\nMarinaj is a recipient of the Pjetër Arbnori Prize for literature from QNK, part of the Albanian Ministry of Culture, in 2008.\n\n"}

Most categories reconstructed for the Proto-Germanic verb system are preserved in Gothic. Note, however, that our knowledge of the Proto-Germanic verb is itself to a large degree based on Gothic, meaning that its reconstruction may be fragmentary.\n\nThe following is a table of all the different types and subtypes of strong verbs.\n\nThe following strong verbs are extant in Gothic:\n\n\nThe following is a sample paradigm of a strong verb, niman \"to take\".\n\nThe following is a sample paradigm of three class I weak verbs, nasjan \"to save\" (short stem-syllable), stōjan \"to judge\" (long open stem-syllable), and sōkjan \"to seek\" (long closed stem-syllable).\n\nNote that verbs with a polysyllabic root behave like sōkjan regardless of the nature of the last syllable of the root; hence, glitmunjan \"to shine\" behaves like sōkjan and is conjugated in the present indicative glitmunja, glitmuneis, glitmuneiþ, ...\n\nNote stōjan changes to stauida in the past in accordance with general phonetic rules. Other verbs with similar changes are\n\nSome class I verbs have an irregular past due to the fact that the -i- in the past was lost in Proto-Germanic:\n\nNote:\n\nThe following is a sample paradigm of a class II weak verb, salbōn \"to anoint\".\n\nThe following is a sample paradigm of a class III weak verb, haban \"to have\".\n\nClass III is apparently a closed class, containing only the following verbs: áistan \"to reverence\", ana-silan \"to be silent\", and-staúrran \"to murmur against\", arman \"to pity\", bauan \"to dwell\", fastan \"to fast, hold firm\", fijan \"to hate\", ga-geigan \"to gain\", ga-kunnan \"to recognize\", haban \"to have\", hatan \"to hate\", jiukan \"to contend\", leikan \"to please\", liban \"to live\", liugan \"to marry\", maúrnan \"to mourn\", munan \"to consider\", reiran \"to tremble\", saúrgan \"to sorrow\", sifan \"to rejoice\", skaman (sik) \"to be ashamed\", slawan \"to be silent\", trauan \"to trust\", swēran \"to honour\", þahan \"to be silent\", witan \"to watch, observe\". Possibly also *bnauan \"to rub\" belongs here—only the present participle occurs, which is not enough to tell whether this is a Class III weak verb or Class VII strong verb.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe following is a sample paradigm of a class IV weak verb, fullnan \"to become full\".\n\nSo-called \"preterite-present verbs\" are a feature of Germanic languages that have a present tense formed like the past tense (or \"preterite\") of strong verbs. The verbs often have the semantics of modal verbs, and in fact the present-day English modal verbs \"can, could, may, might, shall, should, must\" are descended from Old English preterite-present verbs. The past tense of these verbs is a new formation and has the endings of weak verbs. Arguably, all seven classes of strong verbs are represented in Gothic by at least one preterite-present verb.\n\nThe following table presents substantially all extant forms of each of the existing preterite-present verbs in Gothic. In some cases, extant forms are not given when another closely related extant form appears. For example, third plural present indicative skulun is doubtless extant, but is not given because it is easily derivable from the extant first plural form skulum. Note that many of the missing forms can be derived from existing forms as the number of principal parts is small—in fact, three is usually enough: First/third person singular present indicative, first (or third) person plural present indicative, first/third person singular past indicative. However, occasional small irregularities may occur, and the table below errs on the side of under-generalization.\n\nThe forms given are:\n\nThis highly irregular verb derives from two different Proto-Indo-European roots by suppletion; see Indo-European copula for more.\nThis irregular verb derives from the fossilized optative mood of a Proto-Indo-European verb (not to be confused with the Gothic mood known as optative, which corresponds to the subjunctive mood of PIE and other Germanic languages).\n\n"}
{"id": "8531275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8531275", "title": "Hamer language", "text": "Hamer language\n\nHamer or Hamer-Banna is a language within the South Omotic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. It is spoken primarily in southern Ethiopia by the Hamar people, Banna people, and by speakers of Karo.\n\nThis is a sketch of the phonology of the non-Karo branch of Hamer.\n\nHamer has six places of articulation for consonants, and eleven manners of articulation, though the system is not entirely orthogonal.\n\nConsonants marked with parentheses are surface forms only, appearing predictably due to phonotactics or morphophonemic processes.\n\nConsonant length is distinctive non-initially. Long /ɾ/ is realized as a trilled /r/.\n\nThere are five basic vowels\n\nThe vowels are further subdivided into two main categories (with a third being a surface \"umlaut\" phenomenon (see below)). Category I vowels are shorter, pharyngealized, and have retracted tongue root. Category II vowels are longer, glottalized, and have advanced tongue root.\n\nVowel Harmony exists in that every root word and every suffix belongs to either category I or II. When the category of a root and its suffix do not agree, a kind of umlauting takes place. An umlauted vowel retains its basic place of articulation, and is pronounced between the corresponding category I and II vowels, i.e. of medium length, and unmarked for pharyngealization, glottalization or tongue root position. Generally, the vowel(s) of the suffix undergo umlauting, but there is a set of \"strong\" suffixes which retain their category, and cause the vowels of the root to undergo umlauting.\n\nThere is a sixth non-phonemic vowel, /ə/, which appears in speech epenthetically to \"break up\" otherwise invalid consonant clusters. There is no need to consider this a phoneme, and no definitive reason for it to require a grapheme, as it occurs entirely predictably as part of what is essentially an allophonic process.\n\nSyllable structure is simply (C)V(C), though syllable-final consonants are rare. Strings of at least three vowels are documented. Strings of more than two consonants are not documented. There are a large number of (mostly very simple) rules governing metathesis and epenthesis when consonant clusters appear. In summary, there are three sorts of consonant cluster: \"valid\", \"special\", and \"invalid\". Valid clusters undergo no change between their underlying and surface forms. Special clusters undergo some kind of (generally metathetic) transformation in their surface forms. Invalid clusters insert a non-phonemic /ə/ between the two consonants to create their surface forms.\n\nThere is no official writing system for Hamer, though several romanization schemes have been proposed, along with a Gə'əz orthography. As yet, there is no movement for official recognition of any of these systems.\n\nThis is the romanization used by Jean Lydall. It is perhaps the \"de facto\" standard, simply by being the one in which the majority of the existing corpus is presented.\n\nVowels which have been umlauted are written using the letter for their original sound, combined with an underline.\n\nNo marking of stress occurs.\n\nThis romanization will be used in this article to present grammar examples. The advantages of this scheme are that it allows capitalization (e.g. of proper nouns), and that it should be more familiar to the general linguist (especially one familiar with African studies).\n\nWithin roots, the stressed vowel is marked with an acute (for Category I), a grave (for Category II), a circumflex (for Umlauted Category I) or a caron (for Umlauted Category II). Within \"harmonic\" suffixes (i.e. where no umlauting takes place), or suffixes which have caused Umlauting, no diacritic is used on the suffix. Within Umlauted suffixes, a circumflex or caron is used as appropriate on the first vowel of the suffix.\n\nLetters are provided below with their traditional Amharic names. Rows marked in dark red have special meanings that cannot fully be explained in the table: the ʾÄlf row is used for Category II vowels without a preceding consonant, while the ʿÄyn row is used for Category I vowels without a preceding consonant.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25231518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25231518", "title": "Himariote dialect", "text": "Himariote dialect\n\nHimariote Greek ( \"Kheimarrioutiki dialektos\" or \"Kheimarrioutika\") is a dialect of the Greek language that is mainly spoken by ethnic Greeks in the Himarë region of Albania. Despite the small distances between the towns in the region, there exists some dialectal variation, most prominently in accent.\n\nDespite the fact that the Greek community in Himara resides at the northern end of the Greek-speaking world, in a region known among Greeks as Northern Epirus, the Himariote dialect is a southern dialect of the Greek language, a trait shared by most other dialects in Northern Epirus and Greek prefecture of Thesprotia. Although links with the Greek dialects spoken in Apulia and Mani have been suggested, the exact provenance of Northern Epirote dialects remains obscure. According to Greek linguist Vayacacos, Himariote, as a subbranch of the Northern Epirote dialects, is classified as a southern dialect, but the two towns next to Himarë, Dhërmi and Palasë, speak semi-northern dialects.\n\nBecause of the region's geography and isolation, the local dialect in the Himarë region became separated from the surrounding dialects and underwent a slower evolution, preserving a more conservative and faithful picture of the medieval Greek vernacular. According to Greek professor Anagnostopoulos, this dialect, like other conservative forms of modern Greek, such as the Maniot dialect, was spoken by populations that lived in virtual autonomy during Ottoman rule. Another linguistic analysis suggests that Himarë was colonised by Apulian Italiots after the Turkish raid on Otranto in 1480, but this position is vigorously questioned. Some scholars have argued that there are parallels with the local idioms spoken in Crete as well as in nearby Corfu. In particular, these scholars argue that the dialect of Himarë has parallels with dialects in Crete, whereas the dialect of Dhërmi and Palasë has parallels with those in Corfu.\n\nIn spite of the short distances between these towns, there are differences in the accents of the dialect in every town. Himariote has been affected by language contact, and uses some borrowed words from the Lab Albanian dialect. Some Greek words have also been partially influenced by their Albanian counterparts, such as the local pronunciation of for Standard Greek (\"engineer\"), under the influence of Albanian \"mehaniku\".\n\nContrary to the nearby Albanian idioms that are spoken both inland (Kurvelesh) and in the coastal region in Himara, Slavic influence in Himariote Greek is limited.\n\nA common characteristic of local Greek dialects including Himariote is the use of the archaic disyllabic -ea form. Moreover, the phoneme /s/ is pronounced in a slightly different way, depending on the town: in Dhërmi as a soft /ś/; in Palasa as a half-hard /š’/ while in the town of Himarë as a hard /š/. The people who originate from Himarë sometimes also pronounce /k/ as /ts/. Many younger members do not use \"hard accentuations\" anymore, due to the widespread influence by standard modern Greek in the context of migratory patterns to Greece.\n\nThe Himarriots were multi-lingualis at least since the 16th century. This was very common to the region and the period. They were writing in the Greek dialect of the region in their \"in-group\" communication, mixed with Albanian, Turkish, Italian and some Arabic words. They used Greek in their correspondence with the Pope and other representatives of western countries, as well as with the Russian Empire. When they communicated in Italian, they used a translator, but signed in Greek with Greek conferments of their names. \nDuring the communist era in Albania, the country's borders were sealed for 45 years (1945–1990), while Himarë remained outside of the so-called Greek minority zone, which the Albanian state recognized as Greek populated regions. In accordance with the communist Albanian policy of unification and homogenization, the use of the Greek language in Himarë was forbidden in public, and many Greek-speaking people were forced to move to places in northern or central Albania. As a consequence, Greek schools in the Himarë area were closed, and the local communities stuck to their language, which slowly became archaic when they started to emigrate to Greece (1991) in the aftermath of the communist regime's collapse.\n\nAfter the fall of communism, a considerable number of the population from Himarë migrated to Greece where it largely adopted standard Greek. At present they are still not considered as part of the recognized Greek minority by the Albanian state, while on the other hand they are counted as ethnic Greeks according to the Greek migration policy.\n\n"}
{"id": "80818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80818", "title": "IANAL", "text": "IANAL\n\nIANAL is a Usenet and chat abbreviation (initialism) for the expansion \"I am not a lawyer\". The expansion may be used by non-lawyers who are seeking to avoid accusations of unauthorized practice of law and are not making any recommendation to the particular addressee of their remarks.\n\nA related abbreviation, TINLA, stands for \"This is not legal advice.\" One or both of these expansions often precede opinions about law. The use of these expansions serves as a warning for the reader not to take the opinion as professional legal advice. Many jurisdictions have legal restrictions on actually giving or even appearing to give legal advice, or otherwise practicing as a lawyer without legal qualifications and official registration. Rendition of legal advice by a person who is not licensed to do so can be the basis for a charge of unauthorized practice of law.\n\nThe term appears to be inspired by a 1980s commercial for Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup, in which two spokesmen successively pitched the over-the-counter medication with the line: \"I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.\" The spokesmen were soap opera actors Chris Robinson (who played Dr. Rick Webber on \"General Hospital\") and Peter Bergman (who played Dr. Cliff Warner on \"All My Children\"). The transfer from \"doctor\" to \"lawyer\" is an example of a snowclone. The term IANAL is reported to have been common on Usenet by the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nA variant of IANAL is IANYL (\"I am not \"your\" lawyer\"). The term may be used by a lawyer posting comments on a message board to indicate that the commentator is, in fact, a lawyer, but to emphasize that the commentator does not represent the reader, and to indicate that the comments are not protected by attorney–client privilege and that the commenter disclaims any malpractice or other tort liability should the suggestion be followed with undesirable results. IAAL (\"I am a lawyer\") is sometimes used as well, usually with an explicit disclaimer such as \"IAAL, but I'm not your lawyer\".\n\nThe case law standard for determining what comments cross the line is generally \"the application of law to facts specific to an individual seeking legal advice\". Attorneys may use a disclaimer to reduce confusion, and \"I am not your lawyer\" is part of a typical disclaimer. There are \"weighty obligations\" that go along with the creation of a lawyer–client relationship, particularly if an \"online exchange includes legal advice relating to the client's specific facts\". Courts have held that (in the case of 900 numbers) boilerplate disclaimers without clear actions to indicate assent may not avoid the creation of a lawyer–client relationship.\n\nVariations of IANAL can be applied to different fields, such as IANAMD for \"I am not a Medical Doctor\" or IANAP for \"I am not a physicist\" These expansions serve the same general purpose as IANALto discourage the use of the information as professional advice.\n\n\n"}

This \"Limburgish Dutch\" is confusingly also often referred to simply as \"Limburgish\", although in Belgium such intermediate idiolects tend to be called (\"in-between language\"), no matter the exact dialect/language with which standard Dutch is combined.\n\nThe name \"Limburgish\" (and variants of it) derives only indirectly from the now Belgian town of Limbourg (\"Laeboer\" in Limburgish, IPA: ), which was the capital of the Duchy of Limburg during the Middle Ages. More directly it is derived from the more modern name of the Province of Limburg (1815–39) in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which has been split today into a Belgian Limburg and a Dutch Limburg. In the area around the old Duchy of Limburg the main language today is French, but there is also a particular Limburgish (or Limburgish like, depending on definitions) language which is sometimes referred to as \"Low Dietsch dialects\".\n\nPeople from Limburg usually call their language \"Plat\", the same as Low German speakers do. This \"plat\" refers simply to the fact that the language is spoken in the low plains country, as opposed to the use of \"High\" in High German languages, which are derived from dialects spoken in the more mountainous southerly regions. The word can also be associated with \"platteland\" (Dutch: \"countryside\"). The general Dutch term for the language of ordinary people in former ages was \"Dietsch\" or \"Duutsch\", as it still exists in the term Low Dietsch (\"Plattdütsch\"). This term is originally derived from Proto-Germanic \"þiudiskaz\", meaning \"of the people\" (this word has also been preserved in the Italian word for German, which is \"Tedesco\", and the English word \"Dutch\").\n\nIn Dutch the word \"plat\" means \"flat\", but also refers to the way a language is spoken: \"plat\" means \"slang\" in that case.\n\nLimburgish has partially overlapping definition areas, depending on the criteria used:\n\nExcept for the Southeast Limburgish dialect, Modern Limburgish descends from some of the dialects that formed the offspring of Old Dutch in the Early Middle Ages, its history being at least as long as that of other Low Franconian languages, of which some eventually yielded Standard Dutch. Being a variety of Franconian descent, Limburgish can today be considered as a regional language overarched by two succeeding \"Dachsprachen\", which are Dutch in Belgium and the Netherlands and German in Germany.\n\nUnder the influence of the Merovingian and especially the Carolingian dynasty, Eastern Low Franconian underwent much influence from the neighbouring High German languages. This resulted among other things in the partial participation of Eastern Low Franconian in the High German consonant shift in the 10th and especially the 11th century, which makes the Limburgish-speaking area also part of the so-called Rhenish fan. It is especially this trait which distinguishes Limburgish from Western Low Franconian.\n\nIn the past, all Limburgish dialects were therefore sometimes seen as West Central German, part of High German. This difference is caused by a difference in definition: the latter stance defines a High German variety as one that has taken part in any of the first three phases of the High German consonant shift. It is nevertheless most common in linguistics to consider Limburgish as Low Franconian.\n\nFrom the 13th century on, however, the Duchy of Brabant extended its power. As a consequence, at first the western (i.e. spoken until Genk) and then also the eastern variants of Limburgish underwent great influence of Brabantian. When Standard Dutch was formed out of elements of different Low Franconian dialects in the 16th century, the Limburgish dialects spoken in the Low Countries had little or no influence on this process. As a result, Limburgish – although being essentially a variety of Low Franconian – still has a considerable distance from Standard Dutch with regards to phonology, morphology and lexicon today. Moreover, being of East Low Franconian origin, it also has many distinctive features in comparison with the West Low Franconian varieties such as the Hollandic dialect, the Brabantian dialect and South Guelderish.\n\nIn German sources, the dialects linguistically counting as Limburgish spoken to the east of the river Rhine are called \"Bergish\" (named after the former Duchy of Berg). West of the river Rhine (the former Duchy of Jülich) they are called \"Low Rhenish\", which is considered a transitional zone between Low Franconian and Ripuarian. Thus, formerly German linguists tended to call these dialects Low German.\n\nLimburgish is spoken in a considerable part of the German Lower Rhine area, in what linguistically (though not in any sense politically) could be called German Limburg. This area extends from the border regions of Cleves, Aachen, Viersen and Heinsberg, stretching out to the Rhine river. Modern linguists, both in the Netherlands and in Germany, now often combine these distinct varieties with the Cleves dialects (Kleverländisch). This superordinating group of Low Franconian varieties (between the rivers Meuse and Rhine) is called Meuse-Rhenish (Dutch: \"Maas-Rijnlands\", Welschen 2002), or in German: \"Rheinmaasländisch\".\n\nBoth Limburgish and Low Rhenish belong to this greater Meuse-Rhine area, building a large group of southeastern Low Franconian dialects, including areas in Belgium, the Netherlands and the German Northern Rhineland. The northwestern part of this triangle came under the influence of the Dutch standard language, especially since the founding of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. At the same time, the southeastern portion became part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and was subject to High German language domination. At the dialectal level however, mutual understanding is still possible far beyond both sides of the national borders (Welschen 2002).\n\nThe Meuse-Rhenish dialects can be divided into Northern and Southern varieties. Hence, Limburgish is Southwestern Meuse-Rhenish as spoken in Belgium, the Netherlands and the German Lower Rhine. The Northeastern Meuse-Rhenish dialects as spoken in the Netherlands and in Germany (a little eastward along the Rhine) are unambiguously Low Franconian and can be considered as Dutch. As discussed above, Limburgish straddles the borderline between \"Low Franconian\" and \"Middle Franconian\" varieties. These Southwestern Meuse-Rhenish dialects are more-or-less mutually intelligible with the Ripuarian dialects, but have been influenced less by the High German consonant shift (R. Hahn 2001).\n\nLimburgish is far from being homogeneous. In other words, it has numerous varieties instead of one single standard form. Between 1995 and 1999, a uniform standard form called AGL (\"Algemein Gesjreve Limburgs\", \"Generally written Limburgish\") was developed and proposed, but found too little support. Today the so-called \"Veldeke-spelling\" which was first applied in the 1940s is most of the time used to write in a specific Limburgish dialect. In 2000 the parliament of the province of East-Limburg enacted a measure establishing the Limburgish Language Council (Raod veur 't Limburgs), a committee which advises the East Limburgish parliament on measures in relation to Limburgish. In 2003 the Limburgish Language Council adopted a standard orthography for Limburgish. On the basis of this standard orthography the Limburgish Academy Foundation (\"Stiechting Limbörgse Academie\") is creating Limburgish-Dutch, Limburgish-English, Dutch-Limburgish and English-Limburgish dictionaries.\n\nLimburgish is spoken by approximately 1.6 million people in the Low Countries and by many hundreds of thousands in Germany. It is especially in the Dutch province of Limburg that Limburgish is used not only in everyday speech, but also often in more formal situations and on the local and regional radio. According to a recent study by Geert Driessen, in 2011 Limburgish was spoken by 54 percent of the adults and 31 percent of the children. Limburgish has no real written tradition, except for its early beginnings. Hendrik van Veldeke wrote in a Middle Limburgish dialect. Especially in the Netherlands, the cultural meaning of the language is also important. Many song texts are written in a Limburgish dialect, for example during Carnival. Jack Poels writes most of his texts for Rowwen Hèze in Sevenums, a local dialect within the Northern Limburgish dialects, which is often wrongly assumed to be part of the Limburgish dialect, since the Northern Limburgs dialect is classified in the greater group of South Guelderish dialects and not in the Limburgish dialects.\n\nTo what degree Limburgish actually is spoken in Germany today remains a matter of debate. Depending on the city in these parts of Germany, 50% to 90% of the population speak a local or regional form of Meuse-Rhenish, which is either Limburgish or Bergish, according to A. Schunck 2001. However, this percentage seems to be a clear overestimation, as far as the German situation is concerned. The same holds true for his estimation of the Belgian situation. Moreover, research into some specific variants seems to indicate a gradual process of development towards the national standardised Dutch, especially amongst younger generations. In Belgium, the Limburgish dialects are more endangered than in the Netherlands.\n\nIn a decree dated December 24, 1990, the Belgian Flemish regional government was the first to officially recognise Limburgish, as spoken in West Limburg, as a regional, indigenous language. In March 1997 the Dutch government recognised Limburgish as a regional language (Dutch: \"streektaal\") in the Netherlands. As such, it receives moderate protection under chapter 2 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nIt has been argued, however, that this recognition was highly politically motivated and done more on sociolinguistic than purely linguistic grounds. In 1999, the Dutch Language Union, the \"de facto\" language authority which asserted that it had not been asked for advice, opposed the recognition. From the Limburgish side it has been argued that the arguments put forth against the recognition of Limburgish were not based on linguistic considerations, but rather a concern for maintaining the dominance of the Dutch language.\n\nOn the other hand, Limburgish has not been recognised by the German and Belgian national governments as an official language so far. An attempt at recognition, made after Limburgish had been recognised in the Netherlands, failed in the Belgian parliament due to Flemish opposition. Because in Belgium political power is divided according to linguistic lines, recognizing Limburgish as an official language would have had considerable constitutional implications and undermine the small majority Flemish speakers hold over Walloon speakers in the Belgian State.\n\n\nThe dialect of Venlo is generally considered a transition dialect between East Limburgish and Kleverlandish.\n\n' is a concept used in Germany to describe the Limburgish language (\"South Low Franconian\") of Germany. It is a group spoken in a part of the Bergisches Land Region near Düsseldorf east of the Rhine and in the lower Rhine area between the rivers Rhine and Maas, the latter (called ' or \"\" \"Southeast Low Franconian\") shortly behind the Dutch–German border in the vicinity of Heinsberg and Nettetal. These languages are predominantly seen as belonging to the Limburgish language group.\n\nThey were also referred to as the \"East Limburgish\" group. It encompasses the varieties of Limburgish spoken in Germany. They are also seen as part of the Meuse-Rhenish language group. Population using one of the languages in the group either name their local variety \"Bergish\" (in the Region only), or \"\", or after their village, town, or city \"place\"er . People from outside the Rhineland often make less distinctions and use the term Rhinelandic for large set of varieties of languages.\n\nThe Limburgish group belongs to the Continental West Germanic dialect continuum. As usual inside dialect continua, neighboring languages have a maximum of similarities, and speakers being used to the rather small individual lingual differences in their immediate neighborhood perceive them as close, and familiar, while more distant ones become gradually harder to understand with distance. That ends, in the Dutch–German continuum at least, most often with incomprehensible dialects. Isoglosses are so dense in this area that practically every village or town has its own distinct dialect of Limburgish. Large cities such as Mönchengladbach, Krefeld, and Düsseldorf have several local dialect varieties. The named cities have in common, that they are large enough to in part extend outside the area of the dialect group. Thus each has one or more quarters outside, having vernacular languages belonging to adjacent groups, such as Cleverlands or Ripuarian.\n\nA few sample South Low Franconian dialects are: of near , of in , of central , of , of , of in Krefeld, of central , of in , of northern and central , of , of , of , of , of , and many more.\n\nThe group combines Low Franconian properties with some Ripuarian properties, such as tonal accents, the pronoun \"I\" translates as ' or ', the word \"but\" most often as ', all like Ripuarian. Contrasting, \"time\" is translated as ', \"to have\" mostly as ', \"today\" as ', all typical for Low Franconian.\n\nAn area close to Westphalia called \"\" is considered to be the area where is spoken. This area is limited roughly by a line . For a more encompassing view, see the article on Low Rhenish.\n\n' (also called ') is the Dutch term for a group of dialects spoken north of the Uerdingen line, i.e. from just south of Venlo upward to the North in the Dutch province of Limburg. These dialects share many features with both the and Brabantian dialects and are closer to Standard Dutch than the more southern language varieties (see e.g. Hoppenbrouwers 2001). The term is used by Jo Daan for the entire province north of the Uerdingen line, whereas other linguists use it only for the part that has tonality, the language north of this region then being considered Kleverlandish.\n\nThe north border of the Limburgish tonality zone lies a little north of Arcen and Horst aan de Maas and just above the \"meej/mich\" isogloss, also known as the \"mich-kwartier\". This makes this Limburgish isogloss the northernmost of all. Venlo lies between the \"meej/mich\" isogloss and the Uerdingen line, so the Venlo dialect is the only one with both forms \"ik\" and \"mich/dich\". All dialects in the Dutch province of Limburg spoken north of the tonality border are South Guelderish in linguistic respect.\n\nThe dialects spoken in the most southeastern part of the Dutch province of North Brabant (i.e. in and around Budel and Maarheeze) also have many Limburgish characteristics. An important difference between these dialects and the adjacent ones in the Dutch province of Limburg is, however, that the second-person pronoun \"gij\" is here used instead of \"doe\", as in \"purely\" Brabantian dialects.\n\n\"Centraal-Limburgs\" includes the area around Maastricht, Sittard, Roermond, the eastern half of Belgian Limburg, and the Belgian Voeren area, and stretches further Northeast. Belgian linguists use a more refined classification. Dutch linguists use the term \"Oost-Limburgs\" for the form of Limburgish spoken in an area from Belgian Voeren south of Maastricht in the Netherlands to the German border. For them, \"West-Limburgs\" is the variety of Limburgish spoken in Belgium in the area east of the Uerdingen line, for example in and around Hasselt and Tongeren. It includes areas in Dutch Limburg (like Ool, Maria Hoop and Montfort) and Dutch Brabant. The border of \"West-Limburgs\" and \"Oost-Limburgs\" starts a little south of the area between the villages of 's-Gravenvoeren and Sint-Martens-Voeren in the Belgian municipality of Voeren.\n\nSoutheast Limburgish (') is spoken in and around Kerkrade, Simpelveld, Bocholtz and Vaals in the Netherlands, Aachen in Germany and Raeren and Eynatten in Belgium. Especially in Germany these dialects are usually considered as variants of Ripuarian, not of Limburgish. According to a more contemporary vision, however, all varieties in a wider half circle some 15 to 20 km around Aachen, including 2/3 of Dutch South Limburg and also the so-called Low Dietsch area between Voeren and Eupen in Belgium, can be taken as a group of its own, which recently has been named \"Limburgish of the \"Three Countries Area\"\" (Dutch: ', German: \"\"), referring to the place where the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany meet.\n\nIts concept was introduced by Ad Welschen, mainly based on research by Jean Frins (2005, 2006). This variety still possesses interesting syntactic idiosyncrasies, probably dating from the period in which the old Duchy of Limburg existed. Jan Goossens defines the northwest boundary of South East Limburgish at the \"lijk-lich\" isogloss. The area between this line and the Benrath line is called Ripuarian-Limburgish. The area between the Benrath line and the \"aat-alt\" isogloss is then called Aachens or Limburgish-Ripuarian.\n\nIf only tonality is to be taken as to define this variety, it stretches well across the river Rhine into Germany (see Fournier et al). In Germany, it is consensus to class it as belonging to High German varieties. In order to include this variety properly a more encompassing concept is needed. The combination of Meuse-Rhenish and Ripuarian, including their overlapping transitional zones of Southeast Limburgish and Low Dietsch, will do.\n\nThe sound inventory below is based on the variety of West-Limburgs spoken in Montfort.\n\n\nOverall, Limburgish dialects tend to have more consonants than Dutch. They also tend to have more vowels. According to Peter Ladefoged, the vowel inventory of the dialect of Weert is perhaps the richest in the world. It has 28 vowels, among which there are 9 long monophthongs, 10 short monophthongs and 9 diphthongs (three of which pattern with the long monophthongs, rather than the other diphthongs).\n\nIn most of the Limburgish dialects spoken to the southeast of Panningen—for example those of Roermond, Sittard and Heerlen— appears at the beginning of words in the consonant clusters \"sp\", \"st\", \"sl\", \"sm\", \"sn\" and \"zw\". The same sound is realized as elsewhere (e.g. \"sjtraot\"/\"straot\", \"street\"). This is not the case, however, in the dialects of for example Venlo, Weert, Maastricht, Echt, Montfort and Posterholt.\n\n\nThe diphthongs occur, as well as combinations of + . only occurs in French loanwords and interjections.\n\nIn about 50 Belgian Limburgish dialects, the rounded front vowels are unrounded to in most native words. They are retained in French loanwords such as \"dzjuus\" .\n\nMany dialects of Limburgish (and of Ripuarian) have a pitch accent, having two different accents used in stressed syllables. The difference between these two accents is used for differentiating both various grammatical forms of a single lexeme and minimal tone pairs one from the other.\n\nWith specific regards to Limburgish, these two accents are traditionally known as \"sjtoettoen\" (\"push tone\") and \"sjleiptoen\" (\"dragging tone\"). The dragging tone is lexical while the push tone is not. For example, \"daãg\" with a dragging tone means \"a day\" in Limburgish, while in many Limburgish dialects \"daàg\" with a push tone is the plural form, \"days\" (in addition, can also be articulated in a neutral tone as a third possibility. In this case, it means \"bye-bye\").\n\nThis difference is grammatical, but not lexical. An example of a lexical difference caused by dragging tone is the word \"biè\" which is articulated with a push tone and means \"bee\", forming a tonal minimal pair with \"biẽ\", which is articulated with a dragging tone and means \"at\".\n\nHowever, this feature cannot be compared to the \"real\" tone systems such as for example that of Chinese, Vietnamese or some African languages such as Yoruba, the number of tone contours and their division being far more restricted in Limburgish than in these languages. Other Indo-European languages with a pitch accent include Lithuanian, Latvian, Swedish, Norwegian, Standard Slovene (only some speakers), and Serbo-Croatian.\n\nMost of these languages being spoken at the borders of Europe, it has been suggested that tonality once was present in Proto-Indo-European, and that its disappearance would have spread from the center of the European continent. However, it is generally accepted that this system was already lost in Proto-Germanic. A more plausible explanation of the origin of the Limburgish/Ripuarian tone system is that it originated in the Middle Ages from the apocope of plural schwas in the dialect of Cologne (Kölsch). This change necessitated at its turn a somewhat different articulation of the preceding vowel in the singular form, which was lengthened as in German but only to a limited extent, in order to keep on distinguishing the singular from the plural forms. This specific way of vowel lengthening may finally have resulted in the dragging tone.\n\nIt has been proven by speech analysis that in the Belgian Limburgish dialect of Borgloon, the dragging tone itself is bitonal, while it has also been proved that this is not the case in the adjacent Limburgish dialects of Tongeren and Hasselt.\n\nOther research has indicated that the push tone has a steeper fall in the eastern dialects of Limburgish (e.g. those of Venlo, Roermond and Maasbracht) than it has in western dialects. In addition, both the phonetic realisation and the syllable-based distribution of the contrasts between push and dragging tone seem to be mora-bound in the eastern dialects only. This has been examined especially by Jörg Peters.\n\nMoreover, in some dialects such as that of Sittard and Maastricht, especially the mid and high vowels tend to diphthongize when they have a push tone. So in the dialect of Sittard \"keize\" means \"to choose\" while in the dialect of Maasbracht no diphthongization takes place, so \"keze\" means the same here. This difference has been examined in particular by Ben Hermans and Marc van Oostendorp.\n\nOther examples include plural\nand lexical\n\nVerbs distinguish mood with tone:\n\nThe difference between push tone and dragging tone may also purely mark grammatical declension without there being any difference in meaning, as in the dialect of Borgloon: \"gieël\" (\"yellow\", with dragging tone) as opposed to \"en gieël peer\" (\"a yellow pear\", with push tone). This tonal shift also occurs when the adjective gets an inflectional ending, as in \"nen gieëlen appel (\"a yellow apple\").\n\nIn some parts of Limburg, the tonal plural is being replaced with the Dutch forms among the younger generation, so that the plural for \"daag\" becomes \"dage\" ().\n\nUnlike Dutch, Limburgish has three grammatical genders. In Dutch, for nouns of common gender the determinative particle is \"de\", while neutral nouns use \"het\" as the definite article. In some of the dialects however, similar to most Belgian-Dutch dialects, \"den\" is used before masculine words beginning with \"b\", \"d\", \"h\", \"t\" or with a vowel and in many other dialects \"der\" is used before all masculine words. In most dialects, the indeterminative particle is \"eine(n)\" for masculine nouns, \"ein\" for feminine nouns and \"ei\" or \"'n\" for neuter nouns. Without stress, these forms are most of the time realized as \"ne(n)\", \"n\" and \"e\".\n\nFor some nouns, Limburgish uses simulfixes (i.e. umlaut) to form the plural:\n\n\nPlural and diminutive nouns based on Umlaut start to prevail east towards Germany. However, towards the west, the phonemic distinction between dragging and pushing tone will stop just before Riemst.\n\nThis way of forming plurals is also known in other Germanic languages, in particular German and also, to a lesser degree, English (e.g. \"man\" – \"men\" ; \"goose\" – \"geese\"). However, it does not exist in modern Dutch. (The Dutch pair \"stad\" – \"steden\" \"cities\" is the only case where Dutch has preserved the original umlaut, although it is now just an additional feature along with the standardized ending \"-en\").\n\nThe diminutive suffix is most often \"-ke\", as in Brabantian, or \"-je\"/\"-sje\" after a dental consonant.\n\nAccording to their declension, Limburgish adjectives can be grouped into two classes. Adjectives of the first class get the ending \"-e\" in their masculine and feminine singular forms and always in plural, but no ending in their neuter singular form. When combined with a masculine noun in singular adjectives may also end on \"-en\", under the same phonological conditions which apply to articles. To this class belong most adjectives ending on a \"-ch[t]\", \"-d\", \"-k\", \"-p\", \"-t\" or \"-s\" preceded by another consonant or with one of the suffixes \"-eg\", \"-ig\" and \"-isch\". The other declension class includes most adjectives ending on \"-f\", \"-g\", \"-j\", \"-l\",\"-m\",\"-n\", \"-ng\", \"-r\", \"-w\" or \"-s\" preceded by a vowel; these adjectives only get the ending \"-e(n)\" in their masculine singular form.\n\nWhen used as a predicate, Limburgish adjectives never get an ending: \"Dee mins is gek\" (Maastrichtian: \"That man is crazy\"). Except for neuter adjectives which sometimes get -t: \"'t Eint of 't angert\", though this is dying out.\n\nIn the masculine singular forms of \"mien\", \"dien\", \"zien\" and \"oos\", final \"-n\" is added under the same phonological conditions which apply to articles and adjectives. Deletion of the final \"-n\" in the neuter forms of \"mien\", \"dien\", \"zien\" no longer occurs in the dialect of Venlo and is also disappearing in the dialect of Roermond.\n\nThe most common demonstrative pronouns in Limburgish are:\n\nMost of the Limburgish vocabulary is very similar to that of Standard Dutch or to that of Standard German. However, the more basic words of the language clearly have their grounds in Central German Dialects. For Example, personal pronouns are overwhelmingly similar to German.\n\nHistorically, the vocabulary of the varieties of Limburgish spoken within Flemish (Belgian) territory has been more influenced by French than that of the Limburgish dialects spoken on Dutch and German soil, as appears form words such as \"briquet\" (\"cigarette-lighter\"), \"camion\" (\"truck\") and \"crevette\" (\"shrimp\"). The language has similarities with both German and Dutch, and Hendrik van Veldeke, a medieval writer from the region, is referred to as both one of the earlier writers in German and one of the earliest writers in Dutch.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2448403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2448403", "title": "Neo (constructed language)", "text": "Neo (constructed language)\n\nNeo is an artificially constructed international auxiliary language created by Arturo Alfandari, a Belgian diplomat of Italian descent. The language combines features of Esperanto, Ido, Novial and Volapük. The root base of the language and grammar (in contrast to that of Esperanto and Ido) are closely related to that of the French language, with some English influences.\n\nThe first Neo draft was published in 1937 by Arturo Alfandari but attracted wider attention in 1961 when Alfandari published his books \"Cours Pratique de Neo\" and \"The Rapid Method of Neo\". The works included both brief and complete grammar, learning course of 44 lectures, translations of literary works (poetry and prose), original Neo literature, scientific and technical texts, idioms, detailed bidirectional French and English dictionaries. The total volume of the publications was 1304 pages, with dictionaries numbering some 75 000 words. Such a degree of details was unprecedented among constructed languages of the time.\n\nThe language stands in the tradition of international auxiliary languages such as Esperanto or Ido, with the same goal: a simple, neutral and easy to learn second language for everybody.\n\nNeo attracted the interest of the circle around the \"International Language Review\", a periodical for IAL proponents whose publishers co-founded the international Friends of Neo (\"Amikos de Neo\") with Alfandari; the organization also published its bulletin, the \"Neo-bulten\". For a few years it looked like Neo could give some serious competition to Esperanto and Interlingua.\n\nAs Alfandari's health worsened, to avoid disappearance of his language, he founded a second, more serious organization: the Academy of Neo (\"Akademio de Neo\"), with the task of regulating, nurturing and spreading the language; but the organization turned out to not to be very successful. Progress was cut short by Alfandari's death in 1969 and the language was mostly forgotten.\n\nGrammatically, the language is mostly influenced by Ido and Esperanto; but also, in some characteristics such as a plural \"-s\" and natural-appearing pronouns, by the naturalistic IALs like Interlingua and Occidental.\n\nThe way of forming the vocabulary and the preference for short, monosyllabic words show a substantial Volapük influence but, unlike the latter's roots which are often changed and mutilated beyond recognition, the Neo roots are easily recognizable as Romance.\n\nIt is also notable for its terseness, which exceeds that of English or any International auxiliary language (IAL) of the \"a priori\" type, which makes it very compact and brief in expression, and for the facility of its grammar whose overview occupies only two pages.\n\nNeo uses the 26 letters of the standard Roman alphabet: five vowels and 21 consonants.

In 1899, he was hired by antiquarian bookstore Bertrand Jensen, where he remained until 1910.\n\nThough born and raised in Oslo, Braaten joined the mostly rural landsmål-movement.\nBraaten is best known for his popular plays and novels depicting the life of factory workers alongside Akerselva in Oslo. He published seven novels between 1917 and 1925. Braaten convey a new image of the Oslo not seen before in literature. Braaten was able to provide vivid and richly nuanced images of working-class life on the east side of Oslo during a historical period of industrialization. Criticism of injustice and inequality arises, but there is relatively little political tendency in his literary works. .\n\nHe served as an advisor and theater manager at the Det Norske Teatret in Oslo from its start in 1915 until his death.

In the digital era, significant outtakes have been appended to CD and DVD reissues of many albums and films as bonus tracks or features, in film often, but not always, for the sake of humor. In terms of photos, an outtake may also mean the ones which are not released in the original set of photos (i.e. photo shoots and digitals).\n\nAn outtake is any take of a movie or a television program that is removed or otherwise not used in the final cut. Some of these takes are humorous mistakes made in the process of filming (commonly known to American audiences as bloopers). Multiple takes of each shot are always taken, for safety. Due to this, the number of outtakes a film has will always vastly outnumber the takes included in the edited, finished product.\n\nAn outtake may also be a complete version of a recording that is dropped in favor of another version.\n\nOften outtakes can be found as special features on DVDs. Outtakes can also be found playing over credits at the end of a film or TV program. Well known examples of this are Jackie Chan and Pixar movies, almost all of which play outtakes at the end of the movie. Pixar films, being computer-generated, do not feature \"real\" outtakes, but rather staged ones in which the animation features \"mistakes.\"\n\nOuttakes may also enter stock footage libraries and appear in future productions. For example, \"Don't Tell Everything\" (1921) started as an outtake from \"The Affairs of Anatol\" (1921) and was then expanded with additional footage.\n\nIt is generally considered that the inclusion of outtakes in a film's finished product started with \"Hooper\" (1978), helmed by stunt-man-turned-director Hal Needham and starring Burt Reynolds. Needham decided to include outtakes in the film's end credit scrawl to highlight alternate camera angles for the impressive stunts performed for the movie. Needham also interspersed comedic outtakes of the actors as well.\n\nThe inclusion was so successful with fans that Needham continued to insert comedic outtakes in his future directorial efforts such as \"Smokey & The Bandit 2\" (1980), \"The Cannonball Run\" (1981), \"Stroker Ace\" (1983) and \"Cannonball Run 2\" (1984).\n\nFilm critic Gene Siskel has been critical of outtakes being played over a film's credits, saying of the film \"Liar Liar\":\n\nThis picture ends over the credits with outtakes. I hate that. I don't even care if they're funny, I still hate it because to me it's almost like an act of desperation from the filmmakers saying \"Well we're not sure if we made a funny picture, but we're gonna throw this stuff in and we'll leave you laughing on the way out.\"\n\nThe British programme \"It'll be Alright on the Night\", has been running on ITV since 1977 featuring outtakes. The BBC's answer to this was \"Auntie's Bloomers\", eventually replaced by \"Outtake TV\". Prior to these series, production errors were rarely seen for pre-recorded programmes, since these were edited out before transmission. Nowadays, it is common to see outtakes at the end of films, or compiled into programmes like these.\n\nJust like a movie outtake, music outtakes are recordings that are not used in a final version of an album. Collections of this sort of material are often compiled and distributed illegally by fans, and known as a bootlegged recording. Sometimes, artists release collections of outtakes, sometimes grouped with other rarities such as demos and unreleased songs.\n\nOccasionally collections of outtakes become recognized as part of an artist's major creative output, especially in cases where an artist is unusually prolific or dies young. One example would be \"The Lillywhite Sessions\" by Dave Matthews Band, an album that was considered unfinished and not ready to be distributed, yet is widely considered part of the discography of the band by their fans. An example of the former is the eleven-volume \"Bootleg Series\" from Bob Dylan, which contains many important Dylan songs omitted from his albums, some of which were made famous by other artists. An example of the latter is the CD \"Time of No Reply\" by Nick Drake, a British singer-songwriter who died almost unknown at the age of 26 in 1974, but whose music became highly influential on other artists in subsequent decades.\n\nIn a similar vein as a music outtake, video game outtakes are elements (characters, levels, items, cutscenes, etc.) that weren't used in a game's final version. These can be unlocked via hacking or officially through demos.\n\nExamples include \"Crash Bandicoot\", whose notable abandoned level \"Stormy Ascent\" can be unlocked through hacking. Similarly, Donkey Kong, Silver the Hedgehog, Cream the Rabbit, Jet the Hawk, Espio the Chameleon, Big the Cat and a Goomba can be unlocked via hacking on \"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games\".\n\n"}

Some authors, however, reserve the term for more restricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy: context-sensitive grammars or context-free grammars. In a broader sense, phrase structure grammars are also known as \"constituency grammars\". The defining trait of phrase structure grammars is thus their adherence to the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation of dependency grammars.\n\nIn linguistics, phrase structure grammars are all those grammars that are based on the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation associated with dependency grammars; hence, phrase structure grammars are also known as constituency grammars. Any of several related theories for the parsing of natural language qualify as constituency grammars, and most of them have been developed from Chomsky's work, including\n\nFurther grammar frameworks and formalisms also qualify as constituency-based, although they may not think of themselves as having spawned from Chomsky's work, e.g.\n\nThe fundamental trait that these frameworks all share is that they view sentence structure in terms of the constituency relation. The constituency relation derives from the subject-predicate division of Latin and Greek grammars that is based on term logic and reaches back to Aristotle in antiquity. Basic clause structure is understood in terms of a binary division of the clause into subject (noun phrase NP) and predicate (verb phrase VP).\n\nThe binary division of the clause results in a one-to-one-or-more correspondence. For each element in a sentence, there are one or more nodes in the tree structure that one assumes for that sentence. A two word sentence such as \"Luke laughed\" necessarily implies three (or more) nodes in the syntactic structure: one for the noun \"Luke\" (subject NP), one for the verb \"laughed\" (predicate VP), and one for the entirety \"Luke laughed\" (sentence S). The constituency grammars listed above all view sentence structure in terms of this one-to-one-or-more correspondence.\n\nBy the time of Gottlob Frege, a competing understanding of the logic of sentences had arisen. Frege rejected the binary division of the sentence and replaced it with an understanding of sentence logic in terms of predicates and their arguments. On this alternative conception of sentence logic, the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate was not possible. It therefore opened the door to the dependency relation (although the dependency relation had also existed in a less obvious form in traditional grammars long before Frege). The dependency relation was first acknowledged concretely and developed as the basis for a comprehensive theory of syntax and grammar by Lucien Tesnière in his posthumously published work \"Éléments de syntaxe structurale\" (Elements of Structural Syntax).\n\nThe dependency relation is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (word or morph) in a sentence, there is just one node in the syntactic structure. The distinction is thus a graph-theoretical distinction. The dependency relation restricts the number of nodes in the syntactic structure of a sentence to the exact number of syntactic units (usually words) that that sentence contains. Thus the two word sentence \"Luke laughed\" implies just two syntactic nodes, one for \"Luke\" and one for \"laughed\". Some prominent dependency grammars are listed here:\n\nSince these grammars are all based on the dependency relation, they are by definition NOT phrase structure grammars.\n\nOther grammars generally avoid attempts to group syntactic units into clusters in a manner that would allow classification in terms of the constituency vs. dependency distinction. In this respect, the following grammar frameworks do not come down solidly on either side of the dividing line:\n\n"}

Although the first example of written Romani dates from 1542, it is not until the twentieth century that vernacular writing by native Romani people arose.\n\nPrinted anthologies of Romani folktales and poems began in the 20th century in Eastern Europe, using the respective national scripts (Latin or Cyrillic).\nWritten Romani in the 20th century used the writing systems of their respective host societies, mostly Latin alphabets (Romanian, Czech, Croatian, etc.).\n\nCurrently there is no one single standard orthography used by both scholars and native speakers. Efforts of language planners have been hampered by the significant dialectal divisions in Romani: the absence of a standard phonology in turn makes the selection of a single written form problematic.\n\nIn an effort to overcome this, during the 1980s and 1990s Marcel Courthiade proposed a model for orthographic unification based on the adoption of a meta-phonological orthography, which \"would allow dialectal variation to be accommodated at the phonological and morpho-phonological level\". This system was presented to the International Romani Union in 1990, who adopted it as the organization's \"official alphabet\". This recognition by the International Romani Union allowed Courthiade's system to qualify for funding from the European Commission.\n\nDespite being used in several publications, such as the grammar of Romani compiled by Gheorghe Sarău and the Polish publication \"Informaciaqo lil\", the IRU standard has yet to find a broad base of support from Romani writers. One reason for the reluctance to adopt this standard, according to Canadian Rom Ronald Lee, is that the proposed orthography contains a number of specialised characters not regularly found on European keyboards, such as θ and ʒ.\n\nInstead, the most common pattern among native speakers is for individual authors to use an orthography based on the writing system of the dominant contact language: thus Romanian in Romania, Hungarian in Hungary and so on. A currently observable trend, however, appears to be the adoption of a loosely English-oriented orthography, developed spontaneously by native speakers for use online and through email.\n\nDescriptive linguistics has, however, a long and established tradition of transcription. Despite small differences between individual linguists in the representation of certain phonemes, most adhere to a system which Hancock terms \"Pan-Vlax\".\n\nThe overwhelming majority of academic and non-academic literature produced currently in Romani is written using a Latin-based orthography. There are three main systems which are likely to be encountered: the \"Pan-Vlax\" system, the \"International Standard\" and various Anglicised systems.\n\nIn most recent descriptive literature, a variety of the orthography which Ian Hancock terms \"Pan-Vlax\" will likely be used. This orthography is not a single standardised form, but rather a set of orthographical practices which exhibit a basic \"core\" of shared graphemes and a small amount of divergence in several areas. The Pan-Vlax script is based on the Latin script, augmented by the addition of several diacritics common to the languages of eastern Europe, such as the caron.\n\nIn the following table, the most common variants of the graphemes are shown. The phonemes used in the table are somewhat arbitrary and are not specifically based on any one current dialect (for example, the phoneme denoted in the table can be realised as , or , depending on dialect):\n\nThe use of the above graphemes is relatively stable and universal, taking into account dialectal mergers and so on. However, in certain areas there is somewhat more variation. A typically diverse area is in the representation of sounds not present in most varieties of Romani. For example, the centralised vowel phonemes of several varieties of Vlax and Xaladitka, when they are indicated separately from the non-centralised vowels, can be represented using ə, ъ or ă. Another particularly variant area is the representation of palatalised consonants, which are absent from a number of dialects. Some variant graphemes for include tj, ty, ć, čj and t᾿. Finally, the representation of the phoneme (the reflex of the Sanskrit retroflex series), which in several dialects has been merged with , tends to vary between rr, ř and rh, and sometimes even gh, with the first two being the most frequently found variants.\n\nThe \"International Standard\" orthography, as devised by Marcel Courthiade and adopted by the International Romani Union, uses similar conventions to the Pan-Vlax system outlined above. Several of the differences are simply graphical, such as replacing carons with acute accents, transforming č š ž into ć ś ź. However, its most distinctive feature is the use of \"meta-notations\", which are intended to cover cross-dialectal phonological variation, particularly in degrees of palatalisation; and \"morpho-graphs\", which are used to represent the morphophonological alternation of case suffixes in different phonological environments.\n\nThe three \"morpho-graphs\" are ç, q and θ, which are used to represent the initial phonemes of a number of case suffixes, which are realised , and after a vowel and , and after a nasal consonant. The three \"meta-notations\" are ʒ, ŏ and ă, the realisation of which varies by dialect. The latter two, for example, are pronounced and in Lovaricka, but and in Kalderash.\n\nThe English-based orthography commonly used in North America is, to a degree, an accommodation of the Pan-Vlax orthography to English-language keyboards, replacing those graphemes with diacritics with digraphs, such as the substitution of ts ch sh zh for c č š ž. This particular orthography seems to have arisen spontaneously as Romani speakers have communicated using email, a medium in which graphemes outside the Latin-1 charset have until recently been difficult to type. In addition, it is this orthography which is recommended for use by Romani scholar and activist Ronald Lee.\n\nRomani in Macedonia is written with the following alphabet:\n\nThis alphabet is used in the educational system in Macedonia for Romani-speaking students.\n\nKepeski and Jusuf (1980) noted that the following alphabet is used by Romani people in Macedonia and Serbia (Kosovo):\n\nIn Greece, for instance, Romani is mostly written with the Greek alphabet (although very little seems to be written in Romani in Greece).\n\nThe Arabic script has also been used, for example, in Iran. More importantly, the first periodical produced by Roma for Roma was printed in the Arabic script in the 1920s in Edirne in Turkey. It was called \"Laćo\" which means \"good\".\n\n\n"}

He hears this as he is ejected from a parallel world that does not have many of the wars and injustices of the 20th century and returns to our world.\n\n"}
{"id": "5348896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5348896", "title": "Third place", "text": "Third place\n\nIn community building, the third place is the social surroundings separate from the two usual social environments of home (\"first place\") and the workplace (\"second place\"). Examples of third places would be environments such as churches, cafes, clubs, public libraries, or parks. In his influential book \"The Great Good Place\", Ray Oldenburg (1989, 1991) argues that third places are important for civil society, democracy, civic engagement, and establishing feelings of a sense of place.\n\nRobert Putnam addressed issues related to third place in \"Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital\" (1995, 2000).\n\nOldenburg calls one's \"first place\" the home and those that one lives with. The \"second place\" is the workplace — where people may actually spend most of their time. Third places, then, are \"anchors\" of community life and facilitate and foster broader, more creative interaction. In other words, \"your third place is where you relax in public, where you encounter familiar faces and make new acquaintances.\"\n\nOther scholars have summarized Oldenburg view of a third place with a similar eight characteristics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeffres et al. (2009) listed the following types of environments as possible third places, considered in their research: community centers, senior centers, coffee shops and cafes, bars and pubs, restaurants, shopping centers, stores, malls, markets, hair salons, barber and beauty shops, recreation centers, YM/WCA, pools, movie theaters, churches, schools, colleges and universities, clubs and organizations, libraries, parks and other places allowing for outdoor recreation, streets, neighbors’ yards, homes and apartments, and events like neighborhood parties, block parties, cookouts, barbecues, town meetings, bingo, and various media (online, newsletters, newspapers, phone, bulletin boards).\n\nThe concept of a \"third place\" has become popularized and has been picked up by various small businesses, including as a name for various locally owned coffee shops, and is commonly cited in urban planning literature on the issue of community-oriented business development and public space.\n\nAs \"third place\" becomes more popular, several coworking office spaces have embraced this concept as the basis of their interior design.\n\nVariant forms of the concept include the \"community coffee house\" and the \"community living room\", a term which has been adopted by several organizations to describe the model of a cooperatively-run \"third space\" which includes commercial or non-commercial functions with an emphasis on providing a free space for social interaction.\n\nThe general store or pub and occasionally bookstore or diner are traditional variants of the concept, provided in such cases there is an emphasis on expectation of socialization, and customers are invited to stay and \"hang out\" with or without making any (or additional) purchases. Institutions which traditionally provided some functions of a third place included shared leisure facilities such as a bowling alley or arcade, function halls, lodges or social clubs, when and if facilities were available for casual use.\n\nA church community fills this role for many people, including groups that focus on common interests and hobbies. Activities, events, and cell groups can build the connections that are necessary for authentic community.\n\nSince Oldenburg’s writings, there are people in the computer and internet industry that have declared that third places are observed or shifting to the virtual world or virtual third places. This descriptive practice is easily adopted because of the similarities in descriptive characteristics found between the virtual and physical worlds.\n\nIn combination with the Industrial Revolution and as media transitioned from the public space to more comfortable roles inside one's home, there was a large shift away from public activities because they could be enjoyed within the confines of one’s home. With the advent of online technologies these virtual third places have been observed in online communities. The characteristics observed in these communities vary from their physical application but meet the context of personalization, permeability, approachability, and comfortability.\n\nWith the increasing popularity of online multiplayer video games, individuals from across the world are becoming more connected with each other through these video games. The potential for social culture clashes is inherently high considering the large volume of interactions of users from different cultures. However, the online virtual communities constructed within these games share the same characteristics with traditional third places. One of the more prominent features of these communities is the social equalizing aspect. These games allow users to interact through their in-game character, or avatar, which serve as a medium for the player and removes the players's social identifiers. Avatars often interact via built-in text chat systems, allowing users to communicate without revealing their identity through their voice. Therefore, any type of social identification is dependent upon the avatar, not the actual player.\n\nWhile these online communities provide freedom from traditional social status, that is not to say there are no social hierarchies within the games; each game community constructs their own social norms that determine in-game social status. However, each player begins the game at an equal footing and must achieve social recognition through their in-game accomplishments. The concept of \"regulars\" within third spaces is also prominent in online gaming communities. These regulars are often identifiable through some type of special identifier; some games include special insignia or titles for accomplished users, making these users stand out to all users. The regulars set standards for accepted in-game behavior, serving as a type of social moderator (especially for new players). For instance, many of these games offer the opportunity for PvP (player vs player) combat, in which users battle against each other. However, this creates an opportunity for users to \"grief\" one another, which is intentional harassment meant to disrupt gameplay for other users. This type of behavior is often kept in check by the community regulars. \"Regular\" status is attainable for all users, which furthers the sense of community within the game. As users play more, they are accepted into the community by fellow regulars, forming new social bonds.\n\nAs online technologies advance, these online video games become more accessible to individuals across all backgrounds. While these games are often played on traditional video game consoles or on PCs (which often requires purchasing the video game software), there are many internet browser based games (such as \"RuneScape\" and \"Farmville\") that allow anyone with internet access to play for free. This widens the variety of individuals that are entering into the community.\n\nAn increasing percentage of American workers now telecommute, not from home, but from a third place. Workers cite isolation when telecommuting from home and find working in public spaces a happy medium between the home office and the corporate office. Availability of public wifi has been a major enabler of this trend, and an increasing number of retail chains are catering to it.\n\nA third place which provides internet access may create a hollow effect in that the patrons are physically present but do not make social contact with each other, being absorbed by their remote connections. This is similar to how patrons behave in learning commons environments like those in university libraries where the preponderance of socializing is among people who already know each other. Some businesses, like The Third Place coffeehouse in Arlington, VA, are trying to ameliorate this effect by staging performance art such as live jazz and hosting game nights to encourage audience engagement.\n\nPolitical geographer and urban planner Edward Soja also developed a theory of Thirdspace, in his 1996 book \"Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-And-Imagined Places\". His postmodern conception draws on and is influenced by Henri Lefebvre, Michel Foucault, and postcolonial thinkers Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, bell hooks, Edward Said, and Homi K. Bhabha. Soja's concept of Thirdspace \"breaks the Firstspace-Secondspace dualism and comprises such related concepts as ‘place, location, locality, landscape, environment, home, city, region, territory and geography’ (50) that attempts to come to terms with the representational strategies of real and imagined places. He proposes a ‘trialectics of spatiality’ (57) which is a process, a dynamic force and ‘recombinational and radically open’ (50).\"\n\nMorisson (2018) argues that places in the knowledge economy are evolving. He argues the existence of a Fourth Place. In the knowledge economy, the rise of new social environments is blurring the conventional separation between the first place (home), the second place (work), and the third place. New social environments in the knowledge city can combine elements of the first and second place (coliving); of the second and third place (coworking); and of the first and third place (comingling). Furthermore, the combination of elements of the first, second, and third place in new social environments implies the emergence of a new place, the fourth place.\n\n\n"}

It is only available in the Japanese language. Its name comes from the singing software Vocaloid, for which AH-Software also develops voicebanks. Both AH-Software's Vocaloids and Voiceroids went on sale on December 4, 2009.\n\nIt differs from regular Text to Speech programs in that it gives the user more control over settings like tempo, pitch, and intonation.\n\nVoiceroid uses an engine called \"AITalk\" developed by AI Inc. The user is able to adjust the tempo, pitch, and intonation to make the program sound more natural. The original two products Tsukuyomi Shouta and Tsukuyomi Ai were packaged with the animating software, Crazy Talk SE.\n\nOn October 22, 2010, a new version of the engine was introduced known as, \"Voiceroid+\". The first of this new engine featured a character from the children's anime \"Eagle Talon\", known as Yoshida-kun. Much like Shouta & Ai, he is aimed at young audiences. \n\nThe first three Voiceroids were targeted at younger audiences, so they were subject to censorship, and inappropriate words were filtered out. However, Maki Tsurumaki was designed specifically for a more older audience and is the first of the series to have no form of censorship. Yuzuki Yukari is also the first Vocaloid to have a Voiceroid voicebank as well as a Vocaloid voicebank. For Tohoku Zunko's release the software has been vastly improved compared to previous Voiceroid+ voices.The first two Voiceroids to come in one package are Kotonoha Akane・Aoi. In 2015, the software was upgraded to \"Voiceroid+ ex\".\n\nIn 2017, the newest version of the software \"Voiceroid 2\" was announced. This version has a number of new features and differences, though can still import the past Voiceroid and its variants into it. However, older engine versions will not be able to use any new features.\n\nVoiceroid\n\nVoiceroid+\n\nVoiceroid + Ex\n\n\n"}
