{"id": "293833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293833", "title": "Abaza language", "text": "Abaza language\n\nThe Abaza language (абаза бызшва, \"abaza byzšwa\"; ) is a Northwest Caucasian language in Russia and many of the exiled communities in Turkey. In fact the language has gone through several different orthographies based primarily on Arabic, Roman, and Cyrillic letters. The syntax and phonology are rather unique as its consonant to vowel ratio is remarkably high; making it quite similar to many other languages from the same parent chain. The language evolved during its popularity in the mid to late 1800s and eventually started to die out.\n\nAbaza is spoken by approximately 35,000 people in Russia, where it is written in a Cyrillic alphabet, as well as another 10,000 in Turkey, where the Latin script is used.\nIt consists of two dialects, the Ashkherewa dialect and the T'ap'anta dialect, which is the literary standard. The language also consists of five sub dialects known as Psyzh-Krasnovostok, Abazakt, Apsua, Kubin-Elburgan and Kuvin.\n\nAbaza, like its relatives in the family of Northwest Caucasian languages, is a highly agglutinative language. For example, the verb in the English sentence \"He couldn't make them give it back to her\" contains four arguments (a term used in valency grammar): \"he\", \"them\", \"it\", \"to her\". Abaza marks arguments morphologically, and incorporates all four arguments as pronominal prefixes on the verb. The Abaza language contains two dialects in accordance to the Tapanta and Shkaraua familial districts. The subdialects include Abazakt, Apsua, Kubin-Elburgan, Kuvin and Psyzh-Krasnovostok.\n\nIt has a large consonantal inventory (63 phonemes) coupled with a minimal vowel inventory (two vowels). It is very closely related to Abkhaz, but it preserves a few phonemes which Abkhaz lacks, such as a voiced pharyngeal fricative. Work on Abaza has been carried out by W. S. Allen, Brian O'Herin, and John Colarusso.\n\nThe Abaza language has slowly died out. Different forms of cultural annihilation contributed to its fall, in areas of Russia, and over time its overall endangerment. The language can be broken into 5 different dialects and has several unique grammatical approaches to languages. The Abaza Language was at its peak usage in the mid to late 1800s. \n\nAbaza speakers along the Greater and Lesser Laba, Urup, and Greater and Lesser Zelenchuk rivers are from a wave of migrants in the 17th to 18th centuries who represent the Abaza speakers of today. The end of the Great Caucasian War in 1864 provided Russia with power and control of the local regions and contributed to the decrease in the popularity of pre-existing local languages prior to the war.\n\nThe Abaza language is spoken in Russia and Turkey. Although it is endangered, it is still spoken in several regions across in Russia. These include Kara-Pago, Kubina, Psikh, El'burgan, Inzhich-Chukun, Koi-dan, Abaza-Khabl', Malo-Abazinka, Tapanta, Krasnovostochni, Novokuvinski, Starokuvinski, Abazakt and Ap-sua.\n\nThe vowels /o, a, u/ may have a /j/ in front of it.\n\nSince 1938, Abaza has been written with the version of the Cyrillic alphabet shown below.\n\nFor most mainstream languages the main clause is typically in the final part of the language. In the case of the Abaza language, it is the first clause that is there. Furthermore, within the clause the verbal complex is final. In the verbal structure for the usage of multiple pronouns certain pronouns are treated as nominal forms that a place makers. The existence of only two vowels makes it so that the main stressed syllables are highly important in differentiating verbiage. \n\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "183647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183647", "title": "Anthimeria", "text": "Anthimeria\n\nIn rhetoric, anthimeria, traditionally and more properly called antimeria (from the , \"antí\", \"against, opposite\" and μέρος, \"méros\", \"part\"), involves using one part of speech as another part of speech, such as using a noun as if it were a verb: \"The little old lady turtled along the road.\" Using a noun as a verb has become so common that many nouns have also become verbs. For example, the noun \"book\" is now often used as a verb, as in the example \"Let's book the flight\". Other noun-as-verb usages include \"I can keyboard that for you,\" \"We need to scissor expenses,\" and \"Desk him.\" Other substitutions could include an adjective used as a noun, as in \"She dove into the foaming wet,\" interjection as verb, as in \"Don't aha me!\" a verb as a noun, as in \"Help! I need some eat!\" and so on.\n\n\nThere are a number of examples throughout the English language that demonstrate the evolution of specific words from one lexical category to another. For example, the word 'chill' originated as a noun that could be substituted as a synonym for 'cold'. Throughout the years, 'chill' grew to transition into a verb ('to chill vegetables') and then, subsequently, an adjective ('a chilly morning'). Most recently, 'chill' has yet again transformed into another part of speech, an \"intransitive verb, meaning roughly 'to relax',\" as author Ben Yagoda explains. Yagoda then quotes what he determines to be the starting point of this lexical shift through referencing the lyrics of The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 hit 'Rapper's Delight': \"There's... a time to break and a time to chill/ To act civilized or act real ill\".\n\nA more unusual case of anthimeria is displayed not through a change in lexical category but a change in form altogether. The punctuation mark '/' was originally implemented to juxtapose two similarly related words or phrases, such as a 'friend/roommate', meaning that the referred person is both a friend and roommate to the speaker. However, younger generations have come to morph the symbol '/' into the written and spoken word of 'slash'. Anne Curzan, a professor of English at the University of Michigan, notes that the \"emergence of a new conjunction/conjunctive adverb (let alone one stemming from a punctuation mark) is like a rare-bird sighting in the world of linguistics: an innovation in the slang of young people embedding itself as a function word in the language\".\n\nThe form change from symbol to word also brought about a change in usage, as the situational context of '/' was completely modified to conform to the needs of this new word. The usage of 'slash', according to Curzan, has multiple contextual uses, including the \"distinguishing between (a) the activity that the speaker or writer was intending to do or should have been doing, and (b) the activity that the speaker or writer actually did or anticipated they would do...\". Curzan also finds that 'slash' has been used to \"link a second related thought or clause to the first\" as well as simply \"introduc[ing] an afterthought that is also a topic shift\". Dispersed throughout her blog post entitled \"Slash: Not Just a Punctuation Mark Anymore\", Curzan has compiled a list of the numerous cases in which 'slash' can be employed, a set of data that she obtained through contributions from students in her undergraduate history of English course. A few examples include:\n\n\nWhen classifying anthimeria, it is important to determine the difference between words that are popular for the time being as opposed to words that have become permanent fixtures in the English language. As noted above, the use of 'chill' has become a common occurrence in standard English, and the still-transitioning use of 'slash' seems to be well on its way to becoming a permanent conjunction. While still in the transformation stage of usage though, the majority of newly created words are revealed to be only fads, developed to serve a purpose only while the trend runs it course.\n\nHelen Sword, a professor at the University of Auckland, provides an example in the verb \"Eastwood\", a craze that swept the nation following Clint Eastwood's speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention. \"Within weeks, the fad for \"Eastwooding\" – talking to an empty chair – had already petered out\". Although relevant to the current time period, the distinction between temporary and permanent \"verbifications\" and their equivalents is necessary in noting the evolution of the English language.\n\n\n"}

One of the most successful novelists of Finland, he won a broad readership outside of Finland in a way few other Finnish authors have before. Translated into 27 languages, over seven million copies of his books have been sold worldwide, and he has been claimed as \"instrumental in generating the current level of interest in books from Finland\".\n\nPaasilinna is best known for his 1975 novel \"The Year of the Hare\" (\"Jäniksen vuosi\"), a best-seller in France and Finland, translated into 18 languages, awarded three international prizes, and adapted twice into feature films.\n\nArto Paasilinna's brothers are authors Erno Paasilinna, Reino Paasilinna and Mauri Paasilinna.\n\nArto Paasilinna was born on 20 April 1942 in the Alakylä part of the municipality of Kittilä, in Lapland, Finland. His parents were Väinö Paasilinna (1902–1950, born Gullstén, changed his surname in 1934 after a family conflict) and Hilda-Maria Paasilinna (1908–1983, born Niva). The Paasilinnas had seven children, five sons and two daughters, including the writer Erno Paasilinna; the author, MEP and TV personality Reino Paasilinna; the painter Sirpa Paasilinna-Schlagenwarth; and the writer Mauri Paasilinna.\n\nPaasilinna studied at the General and Elementary School Line at the Lapland Folk Academy. He initially worked as a journalist at \"Nuoren Voiman Liitto\", \"Nuori Voima-lehti\" and various newspapers as writer and editor. At the weekly magazine \"Apu\", he was an editor (1968–1970) and later a columnist (1975–1988).\n\nIn 1975, at the age of 33, Paasilinna found journalism growing \"more superficial and meaningless\" and desired a change; that summer, he sold his boat to fund the writing of \"The Year of the Hare\". The book was an immediate success and from 1975 on Paasilinna became an independent writer able to support himself with his novels, signed to Finnish publisher WSOY since 1977. He still wrote journalism articles and was a columnist on Finnish radio.\n\nIn 2000, Paasilinna was included in the 6th edition of literary critic Pekka Tarkka's dictionary \"Suomalaisia nykykirjailijoita\" (\"Finnish Literary Authors\", 1st ed. 1967).\n\nIn 2002, for Paasilinna's 60th anniversary, journalist Eino Leino published a biography of Paasilinna called \"Lentojätkä. Arto Paasilinnan elämä\"\" (\"The Flight Dude\"). The same year Paasilinna published his own autobiography called \"Yhdeksän unelmaa\" (\"Nine Night's Dream\").\n\nIn 2008 and 2009 while still living in Espoo, Paasilinna was featured in Finnish tabloids for his incoherent behaviour, including reckless driving. In October 2009 he was rushed to a hospital due to a stroke. In April 2010 he was moved to a convalescent home for recovery, and his son named as his treasurer.\n\nPaasilinna died on 15 October 2018 in a nursing home in Espoo, Finland.\n\n, Paasilinna had published about 12 non-fiction books and 35 novels, with almost one novel each year from 1972 to 2009 (except 1973, 1978, 2002): as his publishers say, \"The annual Paasilinna is as much an element of the Finnish autumn as falling birch leaves.\" He is \"constantly being translated into new languages\", and 18 of his books have been translated overall into at least 27 languages: the translations beyond neighboring Scandinavian countries include: 17 into Italian, 16 into German, 11 into French, 9 into Slovenian, 6 into Dutch, 5 into Spanish, 4 into Korean, and 2 into English, Ukrainian and Catalan. Described as \"The brightest star in the Finnish translated-literature firmament\" by Finnish newspaper \"Helsingin Sanomat\", his success is claimed as having been \"instrumental in generating the current level of interest in books from Finland\" by his publisher WSOY.\n\nPaasilinna's books reflect quite common Finnish life, usually from a middle-aged male perspective, and in rural Finland. Fast-paced, light and humorous in style, many of these narratives can be described as picaresque adventure stories with often a satirical angle towards modern life. Certain of his stories have been described as modern fables, such as \"The Year of the Hare\", which sets an ex-journalist's quest for authentic life and values in the Finnish backwoods against the emptiness and meaninglessness of modern consumer society. Vatanen, the hero of this novel, takes an injured young hare with him on his quest, nursing the animal back to health, while his own dissatisfaction with his former urban lifestyle becomes ever more evident.\n\nHis 1974 novel \"Paratiisisaaren Vangit\" appears as \"Prisonniers du Paradis\". This book is the humorous story of a UN charter that crashes on a deserted Pacific island. The passengers are lumberjacks and other forestry workers, midwives and nurses. As with \"The Year of the Hare\" (in French, \"Le lièvre de Vatanen\"), the narrator is a journalist. The multinational castaways (Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian and English) give Paasilinna ample opportunity to poke fun at issues of language domination and national stereotypes. The castaways set up a cashless society in which the only remuneration comes in the form of a cup of alcohol distilled in their jungle café in exchange for work for the collectivity. There is also a family planning clinic offering free IUDs. Soon, they find that they are not alone on the island and come up with a plan to get help.\n\nTwo of his novels, \"Lentävä kirvesmies\" and \"Rovasti Huuskosen petomainen miespalvelija\" were adapted to graphic novels by Hannu Lukkarinen.\n\nTitles in quotes are indicative for untranslated books.\n\n, his 35 novels are:\n\nHis other books include:\n\n\n\nMany books have been adapted into movies (some dubbed into English), including:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1257599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1257599", "title": "Basal reader", "text": "Basal reader\n\nBasal readers are textbooks used to teach reading and associated skills to schoolchildren. Commonly called \"reading books\" or \"readers\" they are usually published as anthologies that combine previously published short stories, excerpts of longer narratives, and original works. A standard basal series comes with individual identical books for students, a \"Teacher's Edition\" of the book, and a collection of workbooks, assessments, and activities.\n\nBasal readers are typically organized. Stories are chosen to illustrate and develop specific skills, which are taught in a pre-determined sequence. The teacher's editions are also tightly organized, containing much more than the answer key to the questions that usually appear at the end of each reading passage. The teacher's book also contains suggestions for pre-reading and post-reading activities and assessments, as well as scripted questions to ask students at specific points in a story.\n\nBasal readers have been in use in the United States since the mid-1860s, beginning with a series called the McGuffey Readers. This was the first reader published with the idea of having one text for each grade level. Since then, teaching methodologies in school basals have shifted regularly. The Scott Foresman Company published what is perhaps the most famous basal series, whose stories starred two children named Dick and Jane. Dick and Jane books emphasized memorizing words on sight, a method which came to be known as \"look and say.\" This philosophy came under attack in the late 1950s, largely due to Rudolf Flesch's book \"Why Johnny Can't Read\". This was a scathing condemnation of the \"look say\" method, and advocated a return to programs that stressed teaching phonics to beginning readers.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the pendulum did swing back toward a more phonics-based approach. During the latter part of the 1980s, basal usage declined as reading programs began to turn to whole language programs that relied more heavily on trade books, rather than textbooks. The 1990s and early years of the 21st century have seen a renewed interest in skills acquisition which has sparked a resurgence in basal dominance.\n\nThe highly planned nature of basal readers is seen as one of their strengths, as this eases the load on teachers, particularly those who are inexperienced. Specific skills can be easily targeted, tested, and remediated. Those with very controlled vocabulary usage may ease difficulties for beginner or weak readers. Students who are reading below grade level will receive some benefits from using the on-level basal. The exposure will prepare them for state testing. Using a basal reader as a starting point for grade level reading allows educators to quickly assess student reading level. Basals are not meant to be the only resource a student uses, just the starting point.\n\n"}

As a result, all of the vowels within a single word are either front or back, producing vowel harmony. An example of this contrast is between 'rat' (underlyingly ), which is non-palatalized, and (underlyingly ) 'turtle', which is palatalized. This process does not affect loanwords, e.g. 'oil' (from Fulfulde \"nebbam\") or 'school' (from French \"l'école\").

{"id": "40844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40844", "title": "Capture effect", "text": "Capture effect\n\nIn telecommunications, the capture effect, or FM capture effect, is a phenomenon associated with FM reception in which only the stronger of two signals at, or near, the same frequency or channel will be demodulated. \n\nThe capture effect is defined as the complete suppression of the weaker signal at the receiver limiter (if it has one) where the weaker signal is not amplified, but attenuated. When both signals are nearly equal in strength, or are fading independently, the receiver may switch from one to the other and exhibit picket fencing.\n\nThe capture effect can occur at the signal limiter, or in the demodulation stage, for circuits that do not require a signal limiter. Some types of radio receiver circuits have a stronger capture effect than others. The measurement of how well a receiver can reject a second signal on the same frequency is called the capture ratio for a specific receiver. It is measured as the lowest ratio of the power of two signals that will result in the suppression of the smaller signal. \n\nAmplitude modulation, or AM radio, transmission is not subject to this effect. This is one reason that the aviation industry, and others, have chosen to use AM for communications rather than FM, allowing multiple signals transmitted on the same channel to be heard. Phenomena similar to the capture effect are described in AM when offset carriers of different strengths are present in the passband of a receiver. For example, the aviation glideslope vertical guidance clearance beam is sometimes described as a \"capture effect\" system, even though it operates using AM signals.\n\nIn FM demodulation the receiver tracks the modulated frequency shift of the desired carrier while discriminating against any other signal since it can only follow the deviation of one signal at a time. In AM, the receiver tracks the signal strength of the AM signal as the basis for demodulation. This allows any other signal to be tracked as just another change in amplitude. So it is possible for an AM receiver to demodulate several carriers at the same time, resulting in an audio mix.\n\nIf the signals are close but not exactly on the same frequency, the mix will not only include the audio from both carriers, but depending on the carrier separation an audible tone (a beat signal) may be heard at a frequency equal to the difference in the carrier frequencies involved. For instance, if one carrier is at 1000.000 kHz, and the other is at 1000.150 kHz, then a 150 Hz \"beat frequency\" tone will result.\n\nThis mix can also occur when a second AM carrier is received on a channel that is adjacent to the desired channel if the receiver's ultimate bandwidth is wide enough to include the carriers of both signals. In the US AM broadcast bands this occurs at 10 kHz, which is the US channel spacing for the AM broadcast band. Elsewhere it can occur at 9 kHz, a commonly used channel spacing in many locales.\n\nModern SDR-based receivers can completely eliminate this by utilizing \"brick-wall\" filters narrower than the channel spacing that reduce signals outside the passband to inconsequential levels. Where such an overlap within the passband occurs, a high pitched whistle at precisely 9 or 10 kHz can be heard. This is particularly common at night when other carriers from adjacent channels are traveling long distances due to atmospheric bounce.\n\nBecause AM assumes short term changes in the amplitude to be information, any electrical impulse will be picked up and demodulated along with the desired carrier. Hence lightning causes crashing noises when picked up by an AM radio near a storm. In contrast, FM suppresses short term changes in amplitude and is therefore much less prone to noise during storms and during reception of electrical noise impulses. \n\nFor digital modulation schemes it has been shown that for properly implemented on-off keying/amplitude-shift keying systems, co-channel rejection can be better than for frequency-shift keying systems.\n\n\n"}

It is the only surviving member of the Oghur branch of Turkic languages. Because of this, Chuvash has diverged considerably from the other Turkic languages, which typically demonstrate mutual intelligibility among one another to varying degrees.\n\nThe writing system for the Chuvash language is based on the Cyrillic script, employing all of the letters used in the Russian alphabet and adding four letters of its own: Ӑ, Ӗ, Ҫ and Ӳ.\n\nChuvash is the native language of the Chuvash people and an official language of Chuvashia. It is spoken by 1,640,000 persons in Russia and another 34,000 in other countries. 86% of ethnic Chuvash and 8% of the people of other ethnicities living in Chuvashia claimed knowledge of Chuvash language during the 2002 census. Despite that, and although Chuvash is taught at schools and sometimes used in the media, it is considered endangered, because Russian dominates in most spheres of life, and few children learning the language are likely to become active users.\n\nA fairly significant production and publication of literature in Chuvash still continues. According to UNESCO's \"Index Translationum\", at least 202 books translated from Chuvash were published in other languages (mostly Russian) since ca. 1979. However, as with most other languages of the former USSR, most of the translation activity took place before the dissolution of the USSR: out of the 202 translations, 170 books were published in the USSR, and just 17, in the post-1991 Russia (mostly, in the 1990s). A similar situation takes place with the translation of books from other languages (mostly Russian) into Chuvash (the total of 175 titles published since ca. 1979, but just 18 of them in post-1991 Russia).\n\nChuvash is the most distinctive of the Turkic languages and cannot be understood by speakers of other Turkic tongues. Chuvash is classified, alongside the extinct language Bulgar, as the only remaining member of the Oghuric branch of the Turkic language family. Since the surviving literary records for the non-Chuvash members of Oghuric are scant, the exact position of Chuvash within the Oghuric family cannot be determined.\n\nThe Oghuric branch is distinguished from the rest of the Turkic family (the Common Turkic languages) by two sound changes: \"r\" corresponding to Common Turkic \"z\", and \"l\" corresponding to Common Turkic \"ş\".\n\nFormerly, scholars considered Chuvash not properly a Turkic language at all but, rather, a Turkicised Finno-Ugric (Uralic) language. Already the first scientific fieldwork mission to record Chuvash, by August Ahlqvist in 1856, however established its correct affiliation.\n\nThe modern Chuvash alphabet was devised in 1873 by school inspector Ivan Yakovlevich Yakovlev.\n\nIn 1938, the alphabet underwent significant modification which brought it to its current form.\n\nThe most ancient writing system, known as the Old Turkic alphabet, disappeared after the Volga Bulgars converted to Islam. Later, the Arabic script was adopted. After the Mongol invasion, writing degraded. After Peter the Great's reforms Chuvash elites disappeared, blacksmiths and some other crafts were prohibited for non-Russian nations, the Chuvash were educated in Russian, while writing in runes recurred with simple folks.\n\nThe consonants are the following (the corresponding Cyrillic letters are in brackets): The stops, sibilants and affricates are voiceless and fortes but become lenes (sounding similar to voiced) in intervocalic position and after liquids, nasals and semi-vowels. Аннепе sounds like \"annebe\", but кушакпа sounds like \"kuzhakpa\". However, geminate consonants do not undergo this lenition. Furthermore, the voiced consonants occurring in Russian are used in modern Russian-language loans. Consonants also become palatalized before and after front vowels.\n\nAccording to Krueger (1961), the Chuvash vowel system is as follows (the precise IPA symbols are chosen based on his description since he uses a different transcription).\n\nAndrás Róna-Tas (1997) provides a somewhat different description, also with a partly idiosyncratic transcription. The following table is based on his version, with additional information from Petrov (2001). Again, the IPA symbols are not directly taken from the works so they could be inaccurate.\n\nThe vowels ӑ and ӗ are described as reduced, thereby differing in quantity from the rest. In unstressed positions, they often resemble a schwa or tend to be dropped altogether in fast speech. At times, especially when stressed, they may be somewhat rounded and sound similar to and .\n\nAdditionally, (о) occurs in loanwords from Russian where the syllable is unstressed in Russian.\n\nThe usual rule given in grammars of Chuvash is that the last full (non-reduced) vowel of the word is stressed; if there are no full vowels, the first vowel is stressed. Reduced vowels that precede or follow a stressed full vowel are extremely short and non-prominent. One scholar, Dobrovolsky, however, hypothesises that there is in fact no stress in disyllabic words in which both vowels are reduced.\n\nThere are two dialects of Chuvash:\nThe literary language is based on both the Lower and Upper dialects. Both Tatar and the neighbouring Uralic languages such as Mari have influenced the Chuvash language, as have Russian, Mongolian, Arabic and Persian, which have all added many words to the Chuvash lexicon.\n\nAs characteristic of all Turkic languages, Chuvash is an agglutinative language and as such, has an abundance of suffixes but no native prefixes or prepositions, apart from the partly reduplicative intensive prefix, such as in: шурӑ - \"white\", шап-шурӑ - \"snow-white\", хура - \"black\", хуп-хура - \"jet black\", такӑр - \"flat\", так-такӑр - \"absolutely flat\", тулли - \"full\", тӑп-тулли - \"chock full\" (compare to Turkish beyaz - \"white\", bem-beyaz \"snow-white\", kara - \"black\", kap-kara - \"jet black\", düz - \"flat\", dümdüz - \"absolutely flat\", dolu - \"full\", dopdolu - \"chock full\"). One word can have many suffixes, which can also be used to create new words like creating a verb from a noun or a noun from a verbal root. See Vocabulary below. It can also indicate the grammatical function of the word.\n\nChuvash nouns can take endings indicating the person of a possessor. They can take case-endings. There are six noun cases in the Chuvash declension system:\n\nGrammatical case:\n\nPlural:\n\nAlso:\nAdjective:\nVerb:\n\nTaking кун (day) as an example:\n\nPossession is expressed by means of constructions based on verbs meaning \"to exist\" and \"not to exist\" (\"пур\" and \"ҫук\"). For example, to say, \"My cat had no shoes\":\n\nwhich literally translates as \"cat-mine-of foot-cover(of)-plural-his non-existent-was.\"\n\nChuvash verbs exhibit person and can be made negative or impotential; they can also be made potential. Finally, Chuvash verbs exhibit various distinctions of tense mood, and aspect: a verb can be progressive, necessitative, aorist, future, inferential, present, past, conditional, imperative or optative.\n\nVowel harmony is the principle by which a native Chuvash word generally incorporates either exclusively back or hard vowels (а, ӑ, у, ы) and exclusively front or soft vowels (е, ӗ, ӳ, и). As such, a notation for a Chuvash suffix such as -тен means either -тан or -тен, whichever promotes vowel harmony; a notation such as -тпӗр means either -тпӑр, -тпӗр, again with vowel harmony constituting the deciding factor.\n\nChuvash has two classes of vowels: \"front\" and \"back\" (see the table above). Vowel harmony states that words may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. Шупашкарта \"in Cheboksary\" but килте \"at home\".\n\nTwo vowels cannot occur in succession.\n\nCompound words are considered separate words with respect to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between members of the compound (so forms like сӗтел|пукан \"furniture\" are permissible). In addition, vowel harmony does not apply for loanwords and some invariant suffixes (such as -ӗ); there are also a few native Chuvash words that do not follow the rule (such as анне \"mother\"). In such words suffixes harmonize with the final vowel; thus Аннепе \"with the mother\".\n\nWord order in Chuvash is generally subject–object–verb.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is typically sold at a low price.\n\nCleanskin labels usually only show the grape variety and the year of bottling, as well as other information required by Australian law - alcohol content, volume, additives and standard drink information.\n\nCleanskin wines are typically sold cheaply in dozen lots for home consumption. They may be branded wines that were originally sold at a higher price and re-labelled as cleanskins, or they may be wines produced for the purpose of being sold as cleanskins. Consequently, the quality of various batches of cleanskin wine can vary significantly.\n\nCleanskin wine was introduced to Australia in the early 2000s as a way for the wine industry to cope with a massive oversupply of wine, and a resulting drop in prices. As a result, wine consumption in Australia has greatly increased as of 2006. Also, the price of cleanskin wine has dropped to around or below the price of beer or even bottled water.\n\nThe word \"cleanskin\" comes from the Australian term for unbranded cattle, and is also used to refer to undercover law enforcement agents.\n\n"}
{"id": "1874543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874543", "title": "Cut and fill", "text": "Cut and fill\n\nIn earthmoving, cut and fill is the process of constructing a railway, road or canal whereby the amount of material from cuts roughly matches the amount of fill needed to make nearby embankments, so minimizing the amount of construction labor.\n\nCut slopes are rarely created greater than a slope of two to one (horizontal to vertical dimensions).\nCut sections of roadway or rail are characterized by the roadway being lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. From an operational standpoint there are unique environmental effects associated with cut sections of roadway. For example, air pollutants can concentrate in the ‘'valleys'‘ created by the cut section. Conversely, noise pollution is mitigated by cut sections since an effective blockage of line of sight sound propagation is created by the depressed roadway design.\n\nFill sections manifest as elevated sections of a roadway or trackbed. Environmental effects of fill sections are typically favorable with respect to air pollution dispersal, but in the matter of sound propagation, exposure of nearby residents is generally increased, since sound walls and other forms of sound path blockage are less effective in this geometry.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons for creating fills, among them reduction of grade along a route or elevation of the route above water, swampy ground, or areas where snow drifts frequently collect. Fills can also be used to cover tree stumps, rocks, or unstable soil, in which case material with a higher bearing capacity is placed on top of the obstacle in order to carry the weight of the roadway or railway and reduce differential settlement.\n\nThe practice of cut-and-fill was widely utilized to construct tracks along rolling terrain across the British Isles. It was later performed on new dwellings for returned soldiers in Ireland at the end of World War II. This application was developed by Irish railway engineer Lachlan J. Boland, who saw the benefits of introducing railway practices to residential construction.\n\nA number of software products are available for calculating cut and fill. A simple approach involves defining different earthworks features in a software program and then adjusting elevations manually to calculate the optimal cut and fill. More sophisticated software is able to automatically balance cut and fill and take account of materials. Software that can do this falls under the broad category of earthworks estimation software.\n"}

{"id": "3095080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3095080", "title": "Data retention", "text": "Data retention\n\nData retention defines the policies of persistent data and records management for meeting legal and business data archival requirements; although sometimes interchangeable, not to be confused with the Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nThe different data retention policies weigh legal and privacy concerns against economics and need-to-know concerns to determine the retention time, archival rules, data formats, and the permissible means of storage, access, and encryption.\n\nIn the field of telecommunications, data retention generally refers to the storage of call detail records (CDRs) of telephony and internet traffic and transaction data (IPDRs) by governments and commercial organisations. In the case of government data retention, the data that is stored is usually of telephone calls made and received, emails sent and received, and websites visited. Location data is also collected.\n\nThe primary objective in government data retention is traffic analysis and mass surveillance. By analysing the retained data, governments can identify the locations of individuals, an individual's associates and the members of a group such as political opponents. These activities may or may not be lawful, depending on the constitutions and laws of each country. In many jurisdictions access to these databases may be made by a government with little or no judicial oversight.\n\nIn the case of commercial data retention, the data retained will usually be on transactions and web sites visited.\n\nData retention also covers data collected by other means (e.g., by Automatic number-plate recognition systems) and held by government and commercial organisations.\n\nA data retention policy is a recognized and proven protocol within an organization for retaining information for operational use while ensuring adherence to the laws and regulations concerning them. The objectives of a data retention policy are to keep important information for future use or reference, to organize information so it can be searched and accessed at a later date and to dispose of information that is no longer needed.\n\nThe data retention policies within an organization are a set of guidelines that describes which data will be archived, how long it will be kept, what happens to the data at the end of the retention period (archive or destroy) and other factors concerning the retention of the data.\n\nA part of any effective data retention policy is the permanent deletion of the retained data; achieving secure deletion of data by encrypting the data when stored, and then deleting the encryption key after a specified retention period. Thus, effectively deleting the data object and its copies stored in online and offline locations.\n\nIn 2015, the Australian government introduced mandatory data retention laws that allows data to be retained up to two years. The scheme is estimated to cost at least AU$400 million per year to implement, working out to at least $16 per user per year. It will require telecommunication providers and ISPs to retain telephony, Internet and email metadata for two years, accessible without a warrant, and could possibly be used to target file sharing. The Attorney-General has broad discretion on which agencies are allowed to access metadata, including private agencies.\n\nThe Greens were strongly opposed to the introduction of these laws, citing privacy concerns and the increased prospect of 'speculative invoicing' over alleged copyright infringement cases. The Labor Party initially opposed as well, but later agreed to passing the law after additional safeguards were put in place to afford journalists some protection.\n\nOn 15 March 2006, the European Union adopted the Data Retention Directive, on \"the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC\". It requires Member States to ensure that communications providers retain the necessary data as specified in the Directive for a period of between 6 months and 2 years in order to:\n\n\nThe data is required to be available to \"competent\" national authorities in specific cases, \"for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law\".\n\nThe Directive covers fixed telephony, mobile telephony, Internet access, email, and VoIP. Member States were required to transpose it into national law within 18 months—no later than September 2007. However, they may if they wish postpone the application of the Directive to Internet access, email, and VoIP for a further 18 months after this date. A majority of Member States exercised this option. All 28 EU States have notified the European Commission about the transposition of the Directive into their national law. Of these, however, Germany and Belgium have only transposed the legislation partially.\n\nA report evaluating the Directive was published by the European Commission in April 2011.\n\nIt concluded that data retention was a valuable tool for ensuring criminal justice and public protection, but that it had achieved only limited harmonisation. There were serious concerns from service providers about the compliance costs and from civil society organisations who claim that mandatory data retention was an unacceptable infringement of the fundamental right to privacy and the protection of personal data. The Commission is now reviewing the legislation.\n\nIn response to the report, on May 31, 2011, the European Data Protection Supervisor expressed some concerns on the European Data Retention Directive, underlining that the Directive \"does not meet the requirements imposed by the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection\".\n\nOn 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive 2006/24/EC invalid for violating fundamental rights. The Council's Legal Services have been reported to have stated in closed session that paragraph 59 of the European Court of Justice's ruling \"suggests that general and blanket data retention is no longer possible\". A legal opinion funded by the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament finds that the blanket retention data of unsuspicious persons generally violates the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, both in regard to national telecommunications data retention laws and to similar EU data retention schemes (PNR, TFTP, TFTS, LEA access to EES, Eurodac, VIS).\n\nThe Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act came into force in 2014. It is the answer by the United Kingdom parliament after a declaration of invalidity was made by the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to Directive 2006/ 24/EC in order to make provision, about the retention of certain communications data.\nIn addition, the purpose of the act is to:\n\n\nThe act is also to ensure that communication companies in the UK retain communications data so that it continues to be available when it is needed by law enforcement agencies and others to investigate committed crimes and protect the public.\nData protection law requires data that isn't of use to be deleted, this means that the intention of this Act could be using data retention to acquire further policing powers using, as the Act make data retention mandatory.\n\nAn element of this Act is the provision of the investigatory powers to be reported by 1 May 2015.\n\nThe Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 was referred to as the \"snooper’s charter\" communications data bill.\nThe then Home Secretary Theresa May (and now current Prime Minister), a strong supporter of the Parliament Act, in a speech said that “If we (parliament) do not act, we risk sleepwalking into a society in which crime can no longer be investigated and terrorists can plot their murderous schemes undisrupted.” \n\nThe United Kingdom parliament its new laws increasing the power of data retention is essential to tackling crime and protecting the public. However, not all agree and believe that the primary objective in the data retention by the government is mass surveillance.\n\nAfter Europe's highest court said the depth of data retention breaches citizens' fundamental right to privacy and the UK created its own Act, it has led to the British government being accused of breaking the law by forcing telecoms and internet providers to retain records of phone calls, texts and internet usage.\nFrom this information, governments can identify an individual's associates, location, group memberships, political affiliations and other personal information.\n\nIn a television interview, the EU Advocate General Pedro Cruz Villalón highlighted the risk that the retained data might be used illegally in ways that are \"potentially detrimental to privacy or, more broadly, fraudulent or even malicious\".\n\n\nThe bodies that are able to access retained data in the United Kingdom are listed in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). These are the following:\n\n\nHowever, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) also gives the Home Secretary powers to change the list of bodies with access to retained data through secondary legislation. The list of authorised bodies now includes:\n\n\nThe justifications for accessing retained data in the UK are set out in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). They include:\n\n\nImplementation of the directive was part of Act. No. 259/2010 Coll. on electronic communications as later amended. Under Art. 97 (3), telecommunication data are to be stored between 6 and 12 months. The Czech Constitutional Court has deemed the law unconstitutional and found it to be infringing on the peoples right to privacy.\n\nAs of July 2012, new legislation was on its way.\n\nIn July 2005 new legal requirements on data retention came into force in Italy.\n\n\nItaly already required the retention of telephony traffic data for 48 months, but without location data. Italy has adopted the EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2002 but with an exemption to the requirement to erase traffic data.\n\nDenmark has implemented the EU data retention directive and much more, by logging all internet flow or sessions between operators and operators and consumers.\n\n\nSweden implemented the EU's 2006 Data Retention Directive in May 2012, and it was fined €3 million by the Court of Justice of the European Union for its belated transposition (the deadline was 15 September 2007). The directive allowed member states to determine the duration data is retained, ranging from six months to two years; the Riksdag, Sweden's legislature, opted for six months.\n\nIn April 2014, however, the CJEU struck down the Data Retention Directive. PTS, Sweden's telecommunications regulator, told Swedish ISPs and telcos that they would no longer have to retain call records and internet metadata. But after two government investigations found that Sweden's data retention law did not break its obligations to the European Convention on Human Rights, the PTS reversed course. Most of Sweden's major telecommunications companies complied immediately, though Tele2 lodged an unsuccessful appeal. The one holdout ISP, Bahnhof, was given an order to comply by November 24 deadline or face a five million krona ($680,000) fine.\n\nThe German Bundestag had implemented the directive in \"Gesetz zur Neuregelung der Telekommunikationsüberwachung und anderer verdeckter Ermittlungsmaßnahmen sowie zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie 2006/24/EG\". The law became valid on 1 January 2008. Any communications data had to be retained for six months. On 2 March 2010, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled the law unconstitutional as a violation of the guarantee of the secrecy of correspondence. On 16 October 2015, a second law for shorter, up to 10 weeks long, data retention excluding email communication was passed by parliament. However, this act was ruled incompatible with German and European laws by an injunction of the Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia. As a result, on June 28, 2017, three days before the planned start of data retention, the Federal Network Agency suspended the introduction of data retention until a final decision in the principle proceedings.\n\nThe EU directive has been transposed into Romanian law as well, initially as Law 298/2008. However, the Constitutional Court of Romania subsequently struck down the law in 2009 as violating constitutional rights. The court held that the transposing act violated the constitutional rights of privacy, of confidentiality in communications, and of free speech. The European Commission has subsequently sued Romania in 2011 for non-implementation, threatening Romania with a fine of 30,000 euros per day. The Romanian parliament passed a new law in 2012, which was signed by president Traian Băsescu in June. The Law 82/2012 has been nicknamed \"Big Brother\" (using the untranslated English expression) by various Romanian non-governmental organizations opposing it. On July 8, 2014 this law too was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Romania.\n\nSlovakia has implemented the directive in Act No. 610/2003 Coll. on electronic communications as later amended. Telecommunication data are stored for six months in the case of data related to Internet, Internet email and Internet telephony (art. 59a (6) a)), and for 12 months in the case of other types of communication (art. 59a (6) b)).\n\nIn April 2014, the Slovak Constitutional Court preliminary suspended effectiveness of the Slovak implementation of Data Retention Directive and accepted the case for the further review. In April 2015 Constitutional court decided that some parts of Slovak laws implementing DR Directive are not in compliance with Slovak constitution and Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. According to now invalid provisions of the Electronic Communications Act, the providers of electronic communications were obliged to store traffic data, localization data and data about the communicating parties for a period of 6 months (in the case Internet, email or VoIP communication) or for a period of 12 months (in case of other communication).\n\nA 2016 anti-terrorist federal law 374-FZ known as Yarovaya Law requires all telecommunication providers to store phone call, text and email metadata, as well as the actual voice recordings for up to 6 months. Messaging services like Whatsapp are required to provide cryptographic backdoors to law-enforcement. The law has been widely criticized both in Russia and abroad as an infringement of human rights and a waste of resources.\n\nThe EU's Data Retention Directive has been implemented into Norwegian law in 2011, but this will not be in effect before 1 January 2015.\n\nOn 29 June 2010, the Serbian parliament adopted the Law on Electronic Communications, according to which the operator must keep the data on electronic communications for 12 months. This provision was criticized as unconstitutional by opposition parties and by Ombudsman Saša Janković.\n\nAs from 7 July 2016, the Swiss Federal Law about the Surveillance of the Post and Telecommunications entered into force, passed by the Swiss government on 18 March 2016.\n\nSwiss mobile phone operators have to retain the following data for six months according to the BÜPF:\n\n\nAll Internet service providers must retain the following data for six months:\n\n\nEmail application refers to SMTP-, POP3-, IMAP4, webmail- and remail-server.\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) commonly records Internet metadata for the whole planet for up to a year in its MARINA database, where it is used for pattern-of-life analysis. U.S. persons are not exempt because metadata are not considered data under US law (section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act). Its equivalent for phone records is MAINWAY. The NSA records SMS and similar text messages worldwide through DISHFIRE.\n\nVarious United States agencies leverage the (voluntary) data retention practised by many U.S. commercial organizations through programs such as PRISM and MUSCULAR.\n\nAmazon is known to retain extensive data on customer transactions. Google is also known to retain data on searches, and other transactions. If a company is based in the United States the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can obtain access to such information by means of a National Security Letter (NSL). The Electronic Frontier Foundation states that \"NSLs are secret subpoenas issued directly by the FBI without any judicial oversight. These secret subpoenas allow the FBI to demand that online service providers or ecommerce companies produce records of their customers' transactions. The FBI can issue NSLs for information about people who haven't committed any crimes.\n\nNSLs are practically immune to judicial review. They are accompanied by gag orders that allow no exception for talking to lawyers and provide no effective opportunity for the recipients to challenge them in court. This secret subpoena authority, which was expanded by the controversial USA PATRIOT Act, could be applied to nearly any online service provider for practically any type of record, without a court ever knowing\". The \"Washington Post\" has published a well researched article on the FBI's use of National Security Letters.\n\nThe United States does not have any Internet Service Provider (ISP) mandatory data retention laws similar to the European Data Retention Directive. Some attempts to create mandatory retention legislation have failed:\n\n\nIt is often argued that data retention is necessary to combat terrorism, and other crimes. Data retention may assist the police and security services to identify potential terrorists and their accomplices before or after an attack has taken place. For example, the authorities in Spain and the United Kingdom stated that retained telephony data made a significant contribution to police enquires into the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 2005 London bombings.\n\nThe opponents of data retention make the following arguments:\n\n\nThe current directive proposal (see above) would force ISPs to record the internet communications of its users. The basic assumption is that this information can be used to identify with whom someone, whether innocent citizen or terrorist, communicated throughout a specific timespan. Believing that such as mandate would be useful is ignoring that some very committed community of crypto professionals has been preparing for such legislation for decades. Below are some strategies available today to anyone to protect themselves, avoid such traces, and render such expensive and legally dubious logging operations useless.\n\nThere are anonymizing proxies that provide slightly more private web access. Proxies must use HTTPS encryption in order to provide any level of protection at all. Unfortunately, proxies require the user to place a large amount of trust in the proxy operator (since they see everything the user does over HTTP), and may be subject to traffic analysis.\n\nSome P2P services like file transfer or voice over IP use other computers to allow communication between computers behind firewalls. This means that trying to follow a call between two citizens might, mistakenly, identify a third citizen unaware of the communication.\n\nFor security conscious citizens with some basic technical knowledge, tools like I2P – The Anonymous Network, Tor, Mixmaster and the cryptography options integrated into any many modern mail clients can be employed.\n\nI2P is an international peer-to-peer anonymizing network, which aims at not only evading data retention, but also at making spying by other parties impossible. The structure is similar to the one TOR (see next paragraph) uses, but there are substantial differences. It protects better against traffic analysis and offers strong anonymity and for net-internal traffic end-to-end encryption. Due to unidirectional tunnels it is less prone to timing attacks than Tor. In I2P, several services are available: anonymous browsing, anonymous e-mails, anonymous instant messenger, anonymous file-sharing, and anonymous hosting of websites, among others.\n\nTor is a project of the U.S. non-profit Tor Project to develop and improve an onion routing network to shield its users from traffic analysis. Mixmaster is a remailer service that allows anonymous email sending.\n\nJAP is a project very similar to Tor. It is designed to route web requests through several proxies to hide the end user's Internet address. Tor support has been included into JAP.\n\nThe Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung (German Working Group on Data Retention) is an association of civil rights campaigners, data protection activists and Internet users. The Arbeitskreis coordinates the campaign against the introduction of data retention in Germany.\n\nAn analysis of federal Crime Agency (BKA) statistics published on 27 January 2010 by civil liberties NGO AK Vorrat revealed that data retention did not make a prosecution of serious crime any more effective.\n\nAs the EU Commission is currently considering changes to the controversial EU data retention directive, a coalition of more than 100 civil liberties, data protection and human rights associations, jurists, trade unions and others are urging the Commission to propose the repeal of the EU requirements regarding data retention in favour of a system of expedited preservation and targeted collection of traffic data.\n\nIn November 2012, answers to a parliamentary inquiry in the German Bundestag revealed plans of some EU countries including France to extend data retention to chats and social media. Furthermore, the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Germany's domestic intelligence agency) has confirmed that it has been working with the ETSI LI Technical Committee since 2003.\n\n\n"}

She graduated from secondary school in 1952, and in 1963 she became a licentiate of literary history, religious history, and practical philosophy with her thesis\" Kärlek och kön, en studie i Colettes diktning\" (English: \"Love and gender, a study of the poetry of Colette\"). She was editor of Fredrika-Bremer-Förbundet's periodical Hertha (1960-1962), culture editor in the weekly magazine Vi (1967-1976) and a columnist for Dagens Nyheter (1976-1992). She wrote about social issues, politics, and ethical questions. From 1968 to 1970 she held a position as a script writer for Sveriges Television, Sweden's national television network. There, she wrote a series of notable TV variety shows, and later several sitcoms.\n\nMoberg was an early participant in the gender equality debate in Sweden. In 1961 she published the article \"Kvinnans villkorliga frigivning\" (Woman's Conditional Release), which is considered a Swedish feminist classic. In that article she argued that equality between men and women was still far off, as women were still expected to see marrying and having children as their purpose in life. Her essay started an intense and long-lived debate on men's and women's roles in the family and the society at large. By the middle of the 1960s she became a member of Group 222, a loosely organized activist group for gender equality. Group 222's and Moberg's ideas of an equitable society criticized the traditional man's role; they claimed to seek not only women's but also men's emancipation. \"Men are better than the patriarchy\" was one of Moberg's important ideas - it also became the title of a lecture she later held abroad in the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1970s, Moberg also became involved in campaigns against nuclear power and later in questions of pollution and as a champion of animal rights.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1976, Moberg was married to TV producer Hans Hederberg, with whom she had a daughter in 1966. Eva Moberg later lived, until her death, with author Gottfried Grafström.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Scheb pointed out that in the United States, a majority of the states have initiated measures to make sure that the plea is entered into of the defendant's own accord, and that it is grounded in a factual basis. Scheb wrote, \"Most states have adopted similar rules of procedure to ensure that pleas are voluntary and comply with constitutional requirements.\" He explained that judges have some discretion in determining the voluntary nature of the plea given by the defendant, \"Rules concerning voluntariness and factual basis generally do not specify any precise method to be followed by the court. Judges employ various methods to determine voluntariness. Often these methods include interrogation of the defendant by the judge and sometimes by the prosecutor and defense counsel.\" Scheb noted that, \"The objective is to establish that no improper inducements have been made to secure a plea, that the defendant understands the basic constitutional rights incident to a trial, that these rights are being waived, and that he or she comprehends the consequences of the plea.\" Scheb discussed the manner in which the court determines the factual basis for the plea, \"In determining that a factual basis exists for the defendant's plea, judges often have the prosecutor briefly outline available proof to establish a \"prima facie\" case of the defendant's guilt. A more extensive inquiry is usually necessary for specific-intent crimes.\" Scheb emphasized the importance why it is necessary to establish a factual basis for the plea, before it is entered by the defendant: \"The thoroughness of the court's determination of voluntariness and factual basis becomes important if a defendant later moves to withdraw a plea and enter a plea of not guilty.\"\n\nAlford plea\n"}

{"id": "51118531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51118531", "title": "Gutmensch", "text": "Gutmensch\n\nUsers of the term believe that people or groups of people with a specific moral attitude show a wrong or problematic behaviour. Therefore, it was used as a popular term in the 1980s for people who valued humanistic, altruistic, but also religious and human goals in life higher than utilitarian ones. They organise their actions, politics as well as their lives accordingly.\n\nThe term \"Gutmensch\" is also connected to the term political correctness and has been used in a derogatory manner since the mid 1990s. In general language use it is always used as a negatively connotated foreign appellation. A use that is meant in \"a nice way\" can often be found only in face-to-face conversations, such as the saying \"to have a heart of gold\", in generosity or in an extreme form of altruism.\n\nThe term also hints at the possible difference between \"meant well\" and \"well done\". \"Gutmenschen\" have good intentions, want to solve specific problems or have the desire to create a better world. Those who use the term \"Gutmensch\" in a negative way evaluate the actions of \"Gutmenschen\" as not appropriate or unnecessary. This is how the term is used in everyday language. The German dictionary Duden, which included the term in 2000, defines \"Gutmensch\" as \"a naive person who acts in an uncritical, exaggerated or tedious way while fighting for political correctness.\"\n\nAccording to researcher Rembert Hüser, the term \"Gutmensch\" was coined as a joke made by German feuilleton writers of the \"generation 1989\", such as Matthias Horx and Klaus Bittermann. They were among the authors of dictionaries opposing the protests of 1968. These dictionaries were written in the style of \"Eckardt Henscheids Dummdeutsch\" dictionary (dealing with language criticism) and can be considered a combination of popular and political literature. They did not differentiate between the meaning of a word and how it is used. Bittermann explains in his epilogue of the \"Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen\" (dictionary of the \"Gutmensch\"):\n\nSince the mid 1990s, \"Gutmensch\" has been used alongside political correctness in political and ideological debates, in order to degrade political opponents as over-moralizing.\n\nFormer \"Merkur\" publisher Kurt Scheel once claimed to have used the term first in that sense. \"Gutmensch\" was considered the \"latest critical chic\" in the art sections of newspapers. Writers, like Klaus Bittermann, came up with a variety of neologisms referring to PC and accompanying the appearance of \"Gutmensch\". Some of them can roughly be translated as \"Gutmensch language\", \"bleeding-heart language\", \"attitudinal kitsch\", \"attitudinal language\" or \"chatter jargon\".\n\nIn 2006, the German Journalists Association claimed that the term \"Gutmensch\" had its origins in Nazi Germany. Following that claim, the association planned on including the term in a handbook on the sensitive use of language for journalists, which they wanted to publish in cooperation with the Duisburg Institute of Language and Social Studies. However, some time later the Institute explicitly objected to that claim made by the DJV. Having conducted their own research on this topic, the Institute concluded that there was no clear connection between \"Gutmensch\" and Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, in a pre-published sample of the above-mentioned handbook, it was stated that \"Gutmensch\" had been introduced by the Nazis to refer to followers of Cardinal von Galen, who had openly opposed the Nazi programme of forced euthanasia. According to the DJV, \"Gutmensch\" was derived from the Yiddish expression \"a gutt Mensch\" (a good human). Furthermore, they indicated that it was Adolf Hitler, who in his book \"Mein Kampf\" had repeatedly used the prefix \"gut\" (good) in a derogatory way, so as to accuse people who expressed goodwill and good-heartedness of collaborating with the German enemies.\n\nAnother widespread opinion on where \"Gutmensch\" originates, is that it was Friedrich Nietzsche who coined it. There are numerous disparaging remarks in Nietzsche's writings concerning the \"good human\", albeit not as a fixed expression. The Association for the German Language mentions as their first source a 1985 edition of the Forbes magazine, in which Franz Steinkühler, at that time co-chairman of Germany's biggest metalworker's union, is called a \"Gutmensch\".\n\nA more positive link may be Bertolt Brecht's play \"The Good Person of Szechwan\" () whose main theme is the difficulty of acting good in a world that is not good.\n\n\"Die Welt\" journalist Matthias Heine brings into play German pedagogical scientist Christian Oeser, who may have invented the term. In Oeser's book \"Letters to a Maiden on the most fundamental Topics of Aesthetics\", published in 1859, he writes about naive \"Gutmenschen\" as follows: \"Isn't it clear that in the end, such a gullible \"Gutmensch\" will be laughed at for his unconditional love towards humans, that the whole world will call him a fool and that he will eventually fall prey to his own weakness?\"\n\nIt is worth mentioning that similar terms can be found in other languages as well, for example the Italian \"buonismo\", with meanings all referring to the \"Gutmensch\".\n\nOccasionally, people who see themselves as critics of society ironically condemn would-be campaigners who criticize society without applying the same criteria to themselves. The term \"Gutmensch\" sees criticism of racism as symbolic when the speakers own racist behaviour is not reflected. That kind of criticism means that political utterances which don’t demand consequences are only made to allow the speaker to appear in a good light. Especially Sunday speeches of politicians will be criticized, if they pretend to be advocates for \"victims\". People who are concerned determinedly reject a locking up into a role as victim.\n\nThe \"friend of foreigners\", having good intentions, is a specific example. According to humanistic approaches, they think everyone is equal, but foreigners impose their \"own needs, ethical and moral ideas and goals\" on him (\"jemandem etwas aufzwingen, aufdrängen\") Sabine Forschner).\n\nNorbert Bolz (TU Berlin), an academic in media and communication, said in a radio station Deutschlandfunk on 11 August 2014:\n\nThe term is used with a different purpose and frequency in the overall political spectrum, i.e. as a polemic term in a discussion with (actual and would-be) representatives of a \"political correctness\", but mainly in the field of conservativeness, rightwing populism and rightwing totalitarianism.\n\nThe political right use the term more often in order to discrediting political opposites. By downgrading \"left\" ideals to \"do-goodism\", they emphasise the claim to argue in an own realistic way and on a factual level while the \"Gutmensch\" are implied to have lost touch with reality, to have a weak reflecting capacity, an unrealistic and high claim or utopian ideas. Michael Klonovsky, for example, chief executive at German news magazine \"Focus\", accused:\n\nPeople who are offended in such a way see this as a rhetoric trick, which ridicules their striving for humanism, solidarity and social equity. Seeing the counterpart as \"Gutmensch\" took the discussion to a personal (\"argumentum ad hominem\" = \"ad personam\") and emotional level, in order to avoiding a discussion on a content level.\n\nThe term is often used as an aggressive defense strategy against criticism on personal positions. Potential criticism on (factual or putative) racist, homophobic, anti-semitic (and increasing also anti-Islamic) or sexual violations taboos is debilitated by downgrading the person with those rhetoric strategies.\n\nIn political discussions the usage of the term \"Gutmensch\" gains a moral polarized shape, which is convenient to decrease the respect of the political opponent and to discredit them. There are strategies in political rhetoric to discuss political topics either on a factual level or on a moral level. Stigmatizations of political opponents by using terms like \"pc\" (political correctness) or \"Gutmensch\" moralize communications. Therefore, the position of the political opponent is discredited and he is forced to change position, if he doesn`t want to lose reputation. Especially obvious becomes the strategy, if there are actual or claimed taboos. The art of the rhetoric is working when terms like \"Gutmensch\" or \"moralizing prig\" bring the political opponent in discussions into situations where the reply is supposed to say \"my opinion or the tabooed view\". This rhetoric proves as effective, because only under difficult circumstances can factual matters be discussed analytically. Clemens Knobloch (Universität Siegen) refers to this relationship.\n\nAccording to a discourse analytical survey, which was published by political scientist Katrin Auer in the Österreichischen Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft (ÖZP), are especially topics placed by the political right under the cipher \"pc\" (the term coming up usually because of \"Gutmenschen\") of which the society was not able to talk openly without falling victim to the \"terror of \"Gutmenschen\"\". \"Gutmenschen\" thereby revealed were often pictured club swinging, in this context talking about \"moralizing prig\", \"racist prig\", \"fascist prig\", \"Auschwitz prig\" or similar, so Auer. Therefore, a concept of the enemy and a concept of the taboo came up, in which in particular misogynist, racist and anti-Semitic comments appeared rebellious and taboo breaking, it was said in the article. The term \"Gutmensch\" functioned here as code in order to being able to talk and being understood in this paradigm without having to expose one's own attitude, Auer adds. A well-known example was to replace the word \"Jew\" by the term \"Gutmensch\" in anti-Semitic speeches. Parts of the audience which understood themselves not as anti-Semitic, were allowed to agree without hesitation, concludes Katrin Auer.\n\n\"Gutmenschen\", then called bonhommes or boni homines, was a term used for members of the heretic movement in medieval times. They were also referred to as Cathars, but for themselves they used the name \"veri christiani\" (true Christians). Aside from the derogatory use, the French term \"bonhomme\" (good person) did carry a positive connotation at times, ascribing moral qualities just as the English term \"gentleman\" does. On the other hand, it was non other than Karl Marx who used \"bonhomme\" in a derisive manner. He polemically wrote about \"Jacque le bonhomme\", which was a disguise for mocking Max Stirner.\n\nGerman author and journalist Harald Martenstein developed his own definition of \"Gutmensch\" after repeatedly having dealt with the term \"shitstorm\" (in German exclusively referring to an internet meme) in his writings. In 2015, he proposed using \"Gutmensch\" to describe people who act aggressive and self-righteous when fighting for what they think is the \"good cause\", unmindfully considering themselves being excluded from any set of social rules. \"Gutmenschen\", in that sense, believe that it is ok to be offensive, humiliating and to even exert violence. Not even having publicized his proposal, Martenstein already received heavy criticism. Among the critics was Die Welt journalist Matthias Heine, who accused Martenstein of tempting the wrong people to over-use the word by putting too much of an emphasis on the term, therefore turning \"Gutmensch\" into an unusable word for those being of sound mind. Ironically, one year earlier, German writer Akif Pirinçci had called Martenstein a \"Gutmensch\" in his polemic \"Deutschland von Sinnen\" (Germany unhinged). At that time, Martenstein was still rather in favor of the term, polemically explaining in his book \"Die neuen Leiden des alten M.\" (The New Suffering of Old M.): \"As for good-doing and most things in general, it is a question of the dosage: when overdone it becomes totalitarian.\"\n\nIn 2014, Patrick Orth, manager of German rock band Die Toten Hosen, registered the wordmark \"Gutmensch\". Since then, the band has been selling print T-shirts labeled \"Gutmensch – No one likes us. We don't care!\". 10 Euros per T-shirt are donated to an organisation helping migrant crime victims.\n\nGermany annually nominates a populist word that has a bad connotation. It is called \"Unwort des Jahres\" (in German the prefix Un- can be added to certain nouns, denoting undesirability and depreciating the original meaning). The jury consists of four German linguists and one journalist, who are independent and change every year.\n\n\"Gutmensch\" was nominated in 2011 (second position) and 2015 (first position). In 2011 the jury stated:\nBy using the term the ethical idea of the good man is picked up maliciously in internet forums in order to vilify all dissidents without considering their arguments. The term \"Wutbürger\" (enraged people) is used in a similar way, although the term \"Gutmensch\" violates principles of democracy (...). The term has been used in that way for already 20 years. However, it has gained more influence in different socio-political contexts in 2011 and has therefore increased its potential of vilifying dissidents.\n\nThe statement in 2015 said that the term is connected to the refugee crisis. Here, especially those are insulted who voluntarily help refugees or stand against refugee asylums attacks. The choice was influenced by the refugee crisis in 2015. The term \"Gutmensch\" was selected because \"readiness to help others\" vilified everyone who helped as naive, stupid and unworldly. The criticism was not only against populists of the right, but also against journalists of important media channels who would use the term \"Gutmensch\".\n\n\n"}

The word also applies to the various methods by which the advantage is calculated. In principle, a more experienced participant is disadvantaged, or a less experienced or capable participant is advantaged, in order to make it possible for the less experienced participant to win whilst maintaining fairness. Handicapping is used in scoring many games and competitive sports, including go, shogi, chess, croquet, golf, bowling, polo, basketball, and track and field events. Handicap races are common in clubs which encourage all levels of participants, such as swimming or in cycling clubs and sailing clubs, or which allow participants with a variety of standards of equipment. Often races, contests or tournaments where this practice is competitively employed are known as \"Handicaps\".\n\nHandicapping also refers to the various methods by which spectators can predict and quantify the results of a sporting match. The term is applied to the practice of predicting the result of a competition, such as for purposes of betting against the point spread. A favored team that wins by less than the point spread still wins the game, but bets on that team lose.\n\nIn either case the handicapper is the person who sets the handicaps for the activity. \n\nThe term \"handicap\" derives from hand-in-cap, referring to a system wherein players placed bets or money into the cap of a neutral arbiter to reach an agreement as to the relative values of items sought to be traded.\n\nIn a 'result adjustment' style handicap event, the outcome may be adjusted by some factor determined by the handicap. Some forms of car or yacht racing. In this case, the winner, on elapsed time, may differ from the fastest competitor when the times have been adjusted for the different competitors' handicaps.\n\nIn a 'pursuit' style handicap race, all participants are clocked in a time trial before the race. When this takes place at the same event as the main race, it is known as the handicap. In the race itself, the participants do not all start at the same \"Go\"; the starts are staggered, based on the handicaps. The slowest swimmer, or cyclist, for example, starts first and the fastest starts last, making the end of the race (hopefully) close. An ideal handicap race is one in which all participants finish at the same time. The winner is the person who beats his or her own time.\n\nSimilarly, physically staggered starting positions can be used, for example, in greyhound racing a handicap race is where greyhounds (based on their ability) start from different starting traps set at different measurements from the finish line, and in human foot racing, for example, the Stawell Gift.\n\nSome motorsport events, especially in sports car racing, demand teams to stop the vehicle in the pitbox a fixed period of time depending on the drivers' classification, thus giving advantage to less skilled drivers. An example of a championship using this system is the International GT Open. The advantage of this system over ballast weight systems is that vehicles have the normal performance on track, so better drivers will be able to recover time and overtake slower drivers.\n\nContrarily, horse race handicaping is implemented using extra weight.\n\nA handicap race in horse racing is a race in which horses carry different weights, allocated by the handicapper. A better horse will carry a heavier weight, to give him or her a disadvantage when racing against slower horses. The handicapper's goal in assigning handicap weights is to enable all the horses to finish together (in a dead heat).\n\nThe skill in betting on a handicap horse race is in determining which horse can overcome its handicap.\n\nHandicapping in the game of golf is by manipulating the golfer's score (number of strokes).\n\nTypes of chess handicaps include:\n\nHandicapping in go includes the weaker player being given an advantage by placing a number of stones before the stronger player commences, and by final points adjustment.\n\nHandicapping in shogi is achieved by removing one or more pieces from the stronger player's side. Shogi (Japanese chess) and many of its variants have handicaps.\n\nThe polo handicap is an estimation of the player's worth to his or her team. It is an overall rating of a player's horsemanship, team play, knowledge of the game, strategy and horses. The difference between the total of the polo handicaps for the players on each team is then used to determine the minimum score difference for the better team to score to enable them to win.\n\nHandicaps for sailing vessels in sailing races have varied throughout history, and they also vary by country, and by sailing organisation. Sailing handicap standards exist internationally, nationally, and within individual sailing clubs.\n\nSailing race handicaps may be based on vessel capability and-or crew experience, and today typically adjust the time a vessel takes to reach the finish point of the race.\n\nCalculated Match Average is a handicap calculated for every motorcycle speedway rider.\n\nThere are strategies that involve differences in the lines on the same event at different books. One bet is called a \"middle\", which when a player finds two books that offer different point spreads for the same event. They will bet the more favorable spread at both books, and if the final score falls between the two, the bettor will win both bets. On the other hand, if the total falls outside the range of the \"middle\" the bettor only loses a small percentage of a bet (the \"juice\" or \"vig\" taken by the house).\n\nFor example, Book 1 has Team A as a 3-point favorite, and Book 2 has team B as a 3-point favorite. If a player bets Team B at Book 1, and Team A at Book 2, he will win both bets if either side wins by 2 or less points, and will win one bet and lose the other (known as a \"side\") if either team wins by 3 points.\n\nAnother strategy, known as arbitrage, or an \"arb\" or \"scalp\", involves finding different moneylines for the same event. In this case, the bettor will bet the more favorable line at both books, and have a guaranteed profit. For example, if Book 1 considers Team A to be worth +200 (2 to 1 underdog), and Book 2 considers Team B to be worth +200, a bettor can bet Team A at Book 1, and Team B at Book 2, and guarantee a 100% profit. This is a no-risk bet, as the player is guaranteed a profit no matter the result of the game.\n\nThe first very well known sports handicapper in American culture was Jimmy \"The Greek\" Snyder. During his career he worked for CBS on their Sunday morning show, \"The NFL Today\". Because sports betting had a social taboo at the time, Snyder was not allowed to mention betting on games specifically. Instead, he would predict the score. Over the years the attitude towards sports betting, and handicapping in general, has changed. Billy Walters was profiled by \"60 Minutes\" because of his handicapping abilities. Billy Walters, and other unknown members of the Computer Group, developed a system for handicapping games and beating Las Vegas sportsbooks. \"The Huffington Post\" covered Jon Price a reclusive sports bettor that hires Ph.D's and works off of algorithmic information for his predictions. ESPN wrote an article on Haralabos Voulgaris naming him as the one of the premier NBA handicappers in the world. He claims to have developed a system that uses advanced statistical analysis to predict the outcomes of games. In the past, very few people did any mathematical calculations when handicapping sporting events. Predictions were usually made from hunches or information not readily available to the public. However, with the advancement of technology computers powerful enough to run advanced simulation models now frequent homes and offices. Advanced statistics such as DVOA, Win Shares and Points per Possession are talked about in mainstream media. Brian Burke, author of The Fifth Down blog featured in the \"New York Times\", wrote a formula using advanced statistical techniques that has shown consistency correctly predicting NFL winners. Handicapping, as a profession, is very similar to being a stock analyst. Like Wall Street did in the 1970s, the sports handicapping industry is undergoing a quantitative revolution. Many successful handicappers also use money management systems similar to financial investment professionals. The most popular, and mathematically superior, system is the Kelly criterion. It is a formula for maximizing profits and minimizing losses based on payout odds and win probability of the underlying asset.\n\n\n"}

It is spoken in the nation's Los Lagos and Los Ríos regions; and mountain valleys, between the city of Valdivia and south toward Chiloé Archipelago.\n\nHuilliche is composed of at least two varieties, called Huillichesungun and Tsesungun by their speakers. Huillichesungun is spoken in Wequetrumao, on the island of Chiloé, and Tsesungun is spoken Choroy Traiguen, on the coast of Osorno province. Huilliche is closely related to Mapudungun, the language of the Mapuche, though more research is needed to determine the degree of mutual intelligibility between the two. The \"Enduring Voices\" project of National Geographic reports the following:\"They are to some degree hidden within the broader Mapuche ethnic group, yet consider themselves quite distinct in both language and identity [...] Though the two languages [Huillichesungun and Tsesungun] may share as many as 80% of basic words, we confirmed that they differ in their sounds and grammar, as well as in their ethno-linguistic identity [...] Unexpectedly, Tsesungun, though it is geographically closer to Mapudungun, is less similar to it.\"The Jesuit priest Luis de Valdivia reported in 1606 that there was linguistic unity in the territory between Coquimbo and Chiloé, from the Pacific to the Andes, and that this was composed of varieties whose differences were mostly in pronunciation and vocabulary. This analysis is supported by researchers at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, such as Félix de Augusta or Rodolfo Lenz, and by those in the second half of the 20th century, such as Robert Croese. The latter two noted that Huilliche was the most divergent of the varieties of Araucanian, as did Pilar Álvarez-Santullano, a researcher in the phonology and syntax of Chesungun on the Osorno coast.\n\nMost Huilliche speakers are older adults, and most ethnic Huilliche speak Spanish as their first language, making both Huilliche varieties highly endangered.\n\n\n"}

In late April 1943, when she had just turned two years old, her father, was killed, on the second day of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (Yiddish: varshever geto oyfshtand).\n\nEarlier in 1943, Klepfisz's father had smuggled Irena and her mother out of the ghetto; Irena was placed in a Catholic orphanage, while her mother, using false papers, worked as a maid for a Polish family. After the uprising, her mother retrieved her from the orphanage and fled with her into the Polish countryside, where they survived the Second World War by hiding and concealing their Jewish identities, aided by Polish peasants.

On 2 August, while labouring with his father Thomas near the new fort, he was taken prisoner by Maliseets in the Siege of Pemaquid (1689). His father was killed, one brother was taken by the Penobscot, and only one brother escaped. John was conveyed up the Penobscot River, across portages to the Chiputneticook Lakes, and on to the main Maliseet village Meductic.\nFor six years, Gyles was a slave to the Maliseets. He was forced to serve as drudge to one of the many small hunting parties that moved as far north as Gaspésie and endured harsh treatment.\n\nHis fortunes greatly improved in the summer of 1695 when he was sold to Louis D'Amours de Chauffours, who had a seigneury at Jemseg. John hunted and traded for D'Amours and worked in his store. In October 1696, the English came up the Saint John River to attack the capital of Acadia in the Siege of Fort Nashwaak (1696). D'Amours was in France at the time, but Gyles helped to save his master’s house from destruction. He posted on the door a statement, written by D'Amours’ wife, that English captives had been treated kindly there. After the Treaty of Ryswick, Gyles was delivered to the captain of an English vessel at the mouth of the Saint John and sailed for Boston, where he arrived on 19 June 1698.\n\nGyles’ knowledge of and fluency in the Indian dialects of Acadia made him invaluable to the governing authorities of New England when war broke out again in 1701. During Queen Anne's War, he was with March in the Northeast Coast Campaign (1703). He served as an interpreter under many flags of truce, sailed with Major Benjamin Church in 1704, and fought with Colonel John March at the Siege of Port Royal (1707).\n\nMost of his later life was given to military service and liaison with the Indians. In 1715 he helped construct Fort George at Brunswick; which was attacked in 1722. He remained to command the fort throughout Father Rale's War, until 1725. He finished his military career as commander of the New England garrison on Fort St. George (Thomaston, Maine).\n\nHe married his first wife, Ruth True, in 1703 and his second, Hannah Heath in 1722.\n\nIn 1736 Gyles published his memoirs of his adventures. First printed in Boston in 1736, it was reprinted in 1853 and in 1875, and used as the basis for a modern adaptation of the memoirs by Stuart Trueman in 1966.\n\nGyles Cove, north of Hillman in York County, New Brunswick was named for him.\n\nThe memoirs are considered a precursor to the frontier romances of James Fenimore Cooper, William Gilmore Simms, and Robert Montgomery Bird.\n\nA play was produced about his life called \"John Gyles: an Indian Experience\" by Theatre New Brunswick's Young Company in 1978.\n\n"}

Administratively, it is incorporated within Kamianske municipality as a city of oblast significance. Population: .\n\nOn 19 May 2016, the city was renamed back to historical name of Kamianske. According to the latest data, its population is 273,700. Along with the city's name change, there was renamed the city's hydroelectric station to Middle Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant.\n\nBeside the hydroelectric station, the city houses few other industrial enterprises Prydniprovsky Chemical Plant (closed down), Bahley Coke Factory, and Dnieper Metallurgical Combine.\n\nThe first written evidence of settlement in the territory of Kamianske appeared in 1750. At that time the villages of Romankovo and Kamianske, which make the modern city, were a part of the Nova (New) Sich of the Zaporizhian cossacks. The city was known as Kamianske, lit. \"Stony Place\" (, ) until 1936 when it was renamed to Dniprodzerzhynsk in honor of communist Felix Dzerzhynsky, the founder of the Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka. \n\nSoviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was born and raised in Kamianske.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six months period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of settlements with a name related to Communism.\n\nOn 19 May 2016, the Verkhovna Rada voted to rename a number of populated places in Ukraine including the city of Dniprodzerzhynsk, which was renamed back into Kamianske.\n\nOn July 2, 1996 a notorious traffic accident happened in Dniprodzerzhynsk. An overcrowded tram that was moving along a steep hill on Chapaeva Street began to slide rapidly downhill (because of a brake failure), causing it to derail and hit a concrete wall before coming to a stop very close to a school. A total of 34 people died and more than a 100 were injured as a result of that accident. Following a government inquiry into the causes of the accident the then mayor, Serhiy Shershnev, and his deputy, Ihor Laktionov, resigned.\n\nWhile mostly located on right bank of Dnieper, Kamianske stretches over the hydroelectric station onto the left bank where the portion of city is known as \"Livyi bereh\" neighborhood (literally \"Left bank\"). The neighborhood arches to the west of the Kamianske's suburb of Kurylivka.\n\nTo the east Kamianske municipality borders Dnipro city creating an urban sprawl.\n\n\nThe economic base of Kamianske is almost exclusively centered on heavy industry, with ferrous metallurgy being the backbone of the local economy. Around 57% of the total industrial production is metallurgy and metal working. The chemical industry comes second with ca. 17% share of the total industrial output. While the exceedingly industrialized nature of the local economy ensures a rather high employment rate (as of 01.11.2007, official unemployment stood at 1,40%), it also contributes to excessive pollution and radiation levels in the city.\n\n\nSeveral Eastern Orthodox churches, the largest being the Orthodox Church of Saint Nicholas, which dates from 1894, serve the faithful of the city. By 2008, there were 14 parishes of Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Kamianske.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church of Saint Nicholas built by the city's Polish community at the end of the nineteenth century, has become one of the centers of Roman Catholicism in Eastern Ukraine. The Catholic Parish of Saint Nicholas also includes a monastery run by the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin.\n\nThe town has an active Jewish community with a new synagogue and community center.\n\nKamianske is a city with a very difficult environmental conditions. There have been suggestions to assign the status of the ecological disaster city. Right-bank part of the city is mostly polluted, where the metallurgical, chemical industrial enterprises are located.\n\nKamianske is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

M. Munshi, was an Indian independence movement activist, politician, writer and educationist from Gujarat state. A lawyer by profession, he later turned to literature and politics. He was a well-known name in Gujarati literature. He founded Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, an educational trust, in 1938.\n\nK. M. Munshi was born on 30 December 1887 in the town of Bharuch in Gujarat. He had his school education in R.S Dalal High School in Bharuch. He was educated further in Vadodara (Baroda), where he excelled in academics. One of his teachers at Baroda College was Sri Aurobindo Ghosh who had a profound impression on him. Munshi was also greatly influenced by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel and Bhulabhai Desai.\n\nMunshi was a prolific writer in Gujarati and English, earning a reputation as one of Gujarat's greatest literary figures. He was also a barrister and an eminent jurist.\n\nMunshi was an active participant in the Indian Independence Movement ever since the advent of Mahatma Gandhi. He joined the Swaraj Party but returned to the Indian National Congress on Gandhiji's behest with the launch of the Salt Satyagraha in 1930. He was arrested several times, including during the Quit India Movement of 1942. A great admirer of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Munshi served in the Central Legislative Assembly in the 1930s.\n\nAs the demand for Pakistan gathered momentum, he gave up non-violence and supported the idea of a civil war to compel the Muslims to give up their demand. He believed that the future of Hindus and Muslims lay in unity in an \"Akhand Hindustan\". He was asked by Gandhi to leave Congress due to his lack of faith in non-violence, but was invited back in 1946.\n\n : He was a part of several committees including Drafting Committee, Advisory Committee, Sub- Committee on Fundamental Rights.. Munshi presented his draft on Fundamental Rights to the Drafting Committee and it sought for progressive rights to be made a part of Fundamental Rights.\n\nAfter the independence of India, Munshi was appointed diplomatic envoy and trade agent (Agent-General) to the princely state of Hyderabad, where he served until its accession to India in 1948. Munshi was on the ad hoc Flag Committee that selected the Flag of India in August 1947, and on the committee which drafted the Constitution of India under the chairmanship of B. R. Ambedkar. He was also the main driving force behind the renovation of the historically important Somnath Temple by the Government of India just after independence.\n\nMunshi served as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh from 1952 to 1957. In 1959, Munshi separated from the Nehru-dominated (socialist) Congress Party and started the Akhand Hindustan movement. He believed in a strong opposition, so along with Chakravarti Rajagopalachari he founded the Swatantra Party, which was right-wing in its politics, pro-business, pro-free market economy and private property rights. The party enjoyed limited success and eventually died out. Later, Munshi joined the Jan Sangh.\n\nIn August 1964, he chaired the meeting for the founding of the Hindu nationalist organisation Vishva Hindu Parishad at Sandipini ashram.\n\nBeing a prolific writer and a conscientious journalist, Munshi started a Gujarati monthly called Bhargava. He was joint-editor of Young India and in 1954, started the Bhavan's Journal which is published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan to this day. Munshi was President of the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad and the .\n\nApart from founding Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Munshi was instrumental in the establishment of Bhavan's College, Hansraj Morarji Public School, Rajhans Vidyalaya, Rajhans Balvatika and Panchgani Hindu School (1922). He was elected Fellow of the University of Bombay, where he was responsible for giving adequate representation to regional languages. He was also instrumental in starting the department of Chemical Technology.\n\nBesides being a politician and educator, Munshi was also an environmentalist. He initiated the Van Mahotsav in 1950, when he was Union Minister of Food and Agriculture, to increase area under forest cover. Since then Van Mahotsav a week-long festival of tree plantation is organised every year in the month of July all across the country and lakhs of trees are planted.\n\nMunshi was also a litterateur with a wide range of interests. He is well known for his historical novels in Gujarati, especially his trilogy \"Patan-ni-Prabhuta\" (The Greatness of Patan), \"Gujarat-no-Nath\" (The Ruler of Gujarat) and \"Rajadhiraj\" (The Emperor). His other works include \"Jay Somnath\" (on Somnath temple), \"Krishnavatara\" (on Lord Krishna), \"Bhagavan Parasurama\" (on Parshurama), and \"Tapasvini\" (The Lure of Power) a novel with a fictional parallel drawn from the Freedom Movement of India under Mahatma Gandhi. Munshi also wrote several notable works in English.\n\nMunshi has written mostly based on fictional historical themes namely\n\n\nK.M. Munshi's novel \"Prithvi Vallabh\" was made into a movie of the same name twice. The adaptation directed by Manilal Joshi in 1924 was very controversial in its day: Mahatma Gandhi criticised it for excessive sex and violence.

However, the program is now continued by Global Deaf Connection chaired by Nickson Kakiri. It is based at Machakos Teachers College.\n\nThe Kenya National Association of the Deaf (KNAD) is a national non-governmental organisation formed and managed by Deaf people.

He theorized that by separating the languages from the beginning, parents could prevent confusion and code-mixing in their bilingual children.\n\nGeorge Saunders wrote in his book \"Bilingual Children: From Birth to Teens\" that the “one person, one language” approach “ensures that the children have regular exposure to and have to make use of each language.

In 1924, he was transferred to the Eastern Circle and took part in the excavations at Paharpur. He took voluntary retirement in 1926. After teaching at the University of Calcutta, he later joined the Banaras Hindu University in 1928 and held the post till his premature death on 23 May 1930.\n\nBandyopadhyay's first major independent professional work was in the fields of palaeography and epigraphy. He won the Jubilee Research Prize of the Calcutta University for \"The Origin of the Bengali Script\" published in 1919 (and reprinted in 1973). He was the first to study the proto-Bangla script, the original form of Bangla script. He wrote the classic historical works on medieval Indian coins, and the standard works on the iconography of Indian art, in particular Gupta sculpture and architecture. His best known work was \"Eastern Indian Medieval School of Sculpture,\" published posthumously in 1933.\n\nBandyopadhyay is popular for unearthing pre-Buddhist artefacts at the ruins at Mohenjo-Daro; for noting similarities between the site at Mohenjo-Daro and Harrappa. Those discoveries lead to excavations at the two sites that established the existence of the then-unknown Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation. His interpretations of this civilisation were published in a number of articles and books: \"An Indian City Five Thousand Years Ago\" ; \"Mohenjo-Daro\" (in Bangla, Basumati, 1331 BS); \"Prehistoric, Ancient and Hindu India\" (posthumously published, 1934) and \"Mahenjo-Daro – A Forgotten Report\".\n\nBandyopadhyay wrote two textbooks for Calcutta University, namely, \"History of India\" (1924) and \"A Junior History of India\" (1928). His \"The Age of the Imperial Guptas\" (1933) is a collection of lectures delivered by him in 1924. His standard two-volume \"Bangalar Itihas\" (History of Bengal) in Bengali (1914 and 1917) was one of the first attempts at writing a scientific history of Bengal. He also wrote two volumes on the history of Orissa, titled \"History of Orissa from the Earliest Times to the British Period\" (1930 and 1931).\n\nHis other significant non-fiction works include, \"Prachin Mudra\" (1915), \"The Palas of Bengal\" (1915), \"The Temple of Siva at Bhumara\" (1924), \"The Paleography of Hati Gumpha and Nanaghat Inscriptions\" (1924), \"Bas Reliefs of Badami\" (1928) and \"The Haihayas of Tripuri and their Monuments\" (1931).\n\nHaving published three novels, \"Pakshantar\" (1924), \"Byatikram\" (1924) and \"Anukram\" (1931), his other literary works in Bengali language were historical fictions. The setting of his \"Pashaner Katha\" (1914) is Kushana period. His three other novels, namely, \"Dhruba\", \"Karuna\" (1917) and \"Shashanka\" (1914) are set in the different phases of the Gupta period. His \"Dharmapala\" (1915) narrates the story of the Pala emperor Dharmapala. \"Mayukh\" (1916) describes the Portuguese atrocities in Bengal during the reign of Shahjahan. \"Asim\" (1924) narrates the condition of Bengal during the reign of Farrukhsiyar. His last novel, \"Lutf-Ulla\" is set in Delhi at the time of the invasion by Nadir Shah. Another fictional work, \"Hemkana\" (incomplete) was published in \"Prabasi\" magazine from 1911–12. A number of his novels were translated into other Indian languages.\n\n"}

This happens only if, with every recursive call, the recursive algorithm changes its state and moves toward the base case. Cases that satisfy the definition, without being defined in terms of that definition, are called base cases. They are small enough to solve directly.\n\nThe Fibonacci function(fibonacci(n)), which takes integer n(n >= 0) as input, has three conditions\n\n1. If n is 0, returns 0.<br>\n2. If n is 1, returns 1.<br>\n3. Otherwise, return [fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)]\n\nThis recursive function terminates if either conditions 1 or 2 are satisfied. We see that the function's recursive call reduces the value of n(by passing n-1 or n-2 in the function) ensuring that n reaches either condition 1 or 2.\n\nIf we look at an example of this in Python we can see what's going on a bit more clearly:\nAn example in the programming language C++:\n\nHere we see that in the recursive call, the number passed in the recursive step is reduced by 1. This again ensures that the number will at some point reduce to 0 which in turn terminates the recursive algorithm since we have our base case where we know that the factorial of 0 is 1 (or 0! = 1).\n\nIn the C programing language we could similarly do something like this:\n"}

She is one of the three great pioneers of the organized women's rights movement in Sweden, alongside Fredrika Bremer and Sophie Adlersparre.\n\nRosalie Ulrika Roos was born into a wealthy family. She grew up in Stockholm and was among the first students at the \"Wallinska flickskolan\" in Stockholm, one of the oldest girls' school in Sweden dating to 1831. The family moved in 1839 to Sjogeris at the foot of the mountainous plateau, in Västergötland.\n\nOne of her friends, Hulda Hahr, was a teacher at a girls' school in Limestone, a town near Charleston, South Carolina, United States, and offered her a position on the school. She traveled to the United States in 1851, and stayed there for four years. Roos was first a teacher of French at the school in Limestone, then she became a governess at the plantation of two of her students, Eliza and Annie Peronneau. She later wrote a description of her stay and of the culture of the American South. She did not notice any abuse of the slaves herself, but she considered slavery to be unnatural and \"emotionally disgusting,\" and was convinced that its abolition was unavoidable, though it would meet with much resistance. She returned to Sweden in 1855.\n\nIn 1859, she founded the paper \"Tidskrift för hemmet\" (\"Journal for the Home\") in companionship with her friend Sophie Adlersparre with financial support of Fredrika Limnell. The paper was a feminist publication, which argued for women's rights, particularly the right to higher education and profession. They wrote many of the articles themselves. It was published in Stockholm from 1859 to 1885.\n\nIn 1861, Roos and Adlersparre made a journey through Germany, France, England, Scotland and Ireland to compare the difference within the feminist movements, and reported that the movement was little known in Germany and France in comparison to Great Britain.\n\nIn 1864, she took part in the founding of \"Svenska Röda Korset\" (Swedish Red Cross) with Adlersparre, General Major Rudebeck, and Dr. Lemchen.\n\nIn 1857 she married a widower, Swedish lawyer, statesman and professor, (1817–1905). Olivecrona was professor of law at Uppsala University (1852–1867) and Rector of Uppsala University (1861–1862). He was Supreme Court Justice (1868–1889) and became a member of the International Court of Justice at The Hague from 1902.\n\nRoos moved to Uppsala and became stepmother to her husband's son and three daughters. Their marriage also produced a daughter and a son.\n\n\n\n"}

A sentence can be viewed as expressing a proposition, something that \"must\" be true or false. The restriction of having no free variables is needed to make sure that sentences can have concrete, fixed truth values: As the free variables of a (general) formula can range over several values, the truth value of such a formula may vary.\n\nSentences without any logical connectives or quantifiers in them are known as atomic sentences; by analogy to atomic formula. Sentences are then built up out of atomic formulas by applying connectives and quantifiers.\n\nA set of sentences is called a theory; thus, individual sentences may be called theorems. To properly evaluate the truth (or falsehood) of a sentence, one must make reference to an interpretation of the theory. For first-order theories, interpretations are commonly called structures. Given a structure or interpretation, a sentence will have a fixed truth value. A theory is satisfiable when it is possible to present an interpretation in which all of its sentences are true. The study of algorithms to automatically discover interpretations of theories that render all sentences as being true is known as the satisfiability modulo theories problem.\n\nThe following example in first-order logic\n\nis a sentence, because of the presence of the free variable \"y\". In the structure of the real numbers, this formula is true if we substitute (arbitrarily) \"y\" = 2, but is false if \"y\" = –2. (It is the presence of a free variable, rather than the inconstant truth value, that matters; for example, even in the structure of the complex numbers, where the statement is always true, it is still not considered a sentence.) Such a formula may be called a predicate instead.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2657127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2657127", "title": "Total market coverage", "text": "Total market coverage\n\nA total market coverage, or TMC, is a piece of advertising that reaches all households in a market. Traditionally in most of North America newspapers provided total market coverage, as almost all households would subscribe to the main local paper. As subscription rates have fallen total market coverage products have emerged as a separate project, sometimes administered by newspapers, and sometimes separate businesses known as pennysavers or shoppers.\n\nToday many newspapers will distribute a supplement to free of charge to all households in the paper's market or a specific portion or portions of the market. Total Market Coverage products are meant to attract readers to subscribe or purchase copies of the main newspaper and also provide an additional outlet for advertisers. First appeared with the Dallas Morning News after long time employee Donald Ray Balser came up with the concept and led a large sales team which would become very successful. Some newspapers only deliver the TMC product to non-subscribers. This is accomplished using software that compares the newspaper's subscriber list to residential records, eliminating any duplicates. Some newspapers also choose to insert the TMC inside newspapers delivered to subscribers or sold at newsstands. TMCs are either mailed using special postal rates or delivered by newspaper carriers or motor route driver\n\nDifferent newspapers take different approaches to TMC products.Some are quite simple and even border on low-quality, while others are quite complex. Typically, a TMC product is rather small - perhaps 4 to 12 pages frequently with several pre-printed inserts. Many newspapers use syndicated news stories to fill these pages, But sometimes it is just a mailer with ads and no content. Some newspapers choose to focus on entertainment news while others include local or national news. However, most of the content is either syndicated or reprinted from the main newspaper; very rarely will a newspaper generate original content for a TMC product.\nCommon names for TMC products include \"Extra\", \"MVP\" and \"Plus\". Often the newspaper will tack on one of these words to its main publication's title and use that as its name. For example, the Anytown Tribune might call its TMC product the \"Anytown Tribune Plus\" or \"Anytown Tribune Extra.\" On the other hand, some newspapers develop entirely different names for their TMC products and may exclude or downplay their own name for fear their name might strike a negative chord with non-subscribers.\n\nTMC products often feature special promotions aimed specifically at non-subscribers, offering special rates for subscribing or other special offers. Most newspapers sell advertising in the TMC product. Usually businesses who advertise in the main publication can add an advertisement in the TMC product for a small additional fee, often just a few dollars per column inch, or purchase an advertisement just in the TMC.\n\nTMCs were quite popular in the newspaper industry for several years and were seen as an innovative way to reach non-subscribers (and to offer services that compete with direct mail companies). However, some newspapers have begun questioning the effectiveness of TMCs and are doing away with them or cutting back significantly. Many residents dislike TMC products because of their low quality and the fact they don't wish to have any newspaper delivered to their homes. Often these residents call newspapers and ask the product not be delivered to their home. Most newspapers will honor this request. Another problem with delivering a TMC product is, because of their small size, they can easily blow away in the wind, especially if the intended recipients don't bring them inside. There have been some cases of newspapers being accused of littering as a result of TMC products being found scattered around outdoors.\n"}
{"id": "629702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=629702", "title": "Ulf Lundell", "text": "Ulf Lundell\n\nUlf Lundell (born 20 November 1949 in Södermalm, Stockholm, Sweden, full name \"Ulf Gerhard Lundell\") is a Swedish writer, poet, songwriter, composer, musician and artist.\n\nHe made his debut in 1975 with the LP \"Vargmåne\" and was immediately hailed as \"Sweden's Bob Dylan\". In 1976 his first novel, the partly autobiographical \"Jack\" was published by Wahlström & Widstrand. Lundell was influenced by musicians such as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and writers such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and other beats. Ulf Lundell is one of the central figures in Swedish rock music and almost since his debut he has been one of the most important influences on rock musicians writing and singing in Swedish. Lundell is also somewhat controversial and has argued with everyone from neo-nazis, feminists and communists to colleagues and music journalists.\n\nLundell was known as a heavy drinker in the 1980s, but pulled out of overdrinking after serious bouts with alcoholism in 1985–87; he gave a vivid report of this time, his recovery and his struggle with the rocker myth in the autobiographical novel \"En varg söker sin flock\" (1989; \"A Wolf in Search of his Pack\")\n\n\"Öppna landskap\" (Open landscapes) from 1982, one of his most famous songs, has been playfully proposed as Sweden's new national anthem.\n\nUlf Lundell's father was Gerhard Lundell a blacksmith worker and mother Ingrid (née Lindström) worked among other things as school meal assistant and seamstress. The family first lived in Stockholm in 1958 but moved to Saltsjö-Boo, east of Stockholm. At the age of ten he got his first guitar. Lundell has an older sister named Inger, whose boyfriend taught him his first chords. During the years 1967–75 had Ulf Lundell had a variety of jobs, including postman. During these years he wrote songs and poems which he sent to record labels and publishers.\n\nHe sent a demo to MNW which they declined, telling him \"the material was not strong enough\". Later he sent two demos to Silence, which were also rejected. When he sent a demo to EMI in October 1974 they wanted to record an LP with him. In 1975 he made his debut with the album \"Vargmåne\" (\"Wolf Moon\"). The following year, 1976, came his first novel, \"Jack\", with which he made his breakthrough. The novel is about rebellion against \"medelsvensson\" (Average Joes) circumscribed life in the aftermath of the political uprising at the end of the 1960s. The book had an initial print run of 2,000 copies but ultimately sold 200,000 copies. Meanwhile, when his first work was released, he had already started recording the sequel to \"Vargmåne\". The second album would be called Törst (\"Thirst\") and released just three months after \"Jack\". After that floated on the writing of books and two more were released during the 1970s. \"Törst\" was followed by the live album \"Natten hade varit mild och öm\" (\"The night was mild and tender\") with Nature as backing band for years. The album \"Nådens år\" (\"Year of Grace\") in 1978 year would become his third studio album including a duet with Agnetha Fältskog, \"Snön faller och vi med den\" (\"Snow Falls And We With It\"). In 1979 Lundell released his fourth studio album \"Ripp rapp\" with songs like \"Rom i regnet\" and \"(Oh la la) Jag vill ha dej\". \"Ripp rapp\" was more rock than his previous albums.\n\nIn the fall of 1980 Lundell released the album \"Längre inåt landet\", which was recorded in England. The album includes songs like \"Glad igen\" (\"Happy Again\") and \"Stackars Jack\" (\"Poor Jack\"). The latter was a comment on the criticism Lundell got from his debut novel \"Jack\". Two years later, in 1982, he released the album \"Kär och galen\" (\"In love and crazy\") that contained his most famous work, the song \"Öppna landskap\" (\"Open landscapes\"). It made him one of the biggest artists, and sold four times platinum. Other songs that became popular from \"Kär och galen\" was the title track \"Kär och galen\" and \"När jag kysser havet\" (\"When I kiss the sea\").\n\nWhile waiting for a proper sequel to \"Kär och galen\" Lundell released two records, one in which he interpreted the English songs with Swedish lyrics (\"Sweethearts\") and a completely acoustic album (\"12 sånger\"). Ulf wrestled with severe alcohol problems during this time, which among other things, led to the postponing of his upcoming album several times. During the summer tour in 1985, he did a real disastrous gig in Borgholm drunk, which put him on some headlines in the newspapers. In the fall Lundell released \"Den vassa eggen\" (\"The Sharp Edge\"), an album heavily influenced by the divorce Lundell went through at the time of recording. \"Den vassa eggen\" was very critically acclaimed and was followed by yet another scandal tour in the fall of that year. In 1987 Lundell released the only book Lundell acknowledged writing intoxicated, \"Tårpilen\" and also the album \"Det ljuva livet\" (\"The Good Life\").\n\nLundell alcohol abuse got so bad that he joined Alcoholics Anonymous at this time. 1988 he stated that he had met God and was baptized shortly thereafter in the Ebeneser Church. His newfound Christian faith came to color in the album \"Evangeline\", which was released the same year. 1989 he released his autobiography \"En varg söker sin flock\" (\"A Wolf in Search of his Pack\") and the album \"Utanför murarna\" (\"Outside the Walls\"). He has also been active as a visual artist from 1989.\n\nIt took until 1992 for Lundell to release a new book or album with the novel \"Saknaden\". The book came to be the first installment of a trilogy. 1993 he released the album \"Måne över Haväng\", which contains songs that include \"Rött\" and \"Isabella\". This was the first album that Lundell produced entirely by himself. 1994 he formed his own production company \"Rockhead Studios AB\" and its subsidiaries \"Rockhead Productions\" and \"Rockhead Art\" and secondary name \"Rockhead Music\". That same year he released the acoustic album \"Xavante\". At this time Lundell invested more in music than on writing.\n\nIn 1995 Lundell celebrated 20 years as an artist. The following year he released double album \"På andra sidan drömmarna\" and the live album \"Bosnia\". At this time one can notice that he was inspired more by Neil Young than before Springsteen and Dylan. Especially with the album \"Fanzine\" (1999), which is a disc that is partially recorded in a studio and partly live. 1999 he released his first book in seven years, the sequel to the novel \"Saknaden\", called \"Friheten\".\n\nThe album \"I ett vinterland\" (2000) became his second best-selling album. The album was followed two years later with the double album \"Club Zebra\", an album that was number one in Sweden October 17, 2002. Then followed four studio albums until 2005, the acoustic \"En eld ikväll\" and album trilogy \"Ok Ok Baby\", \"Högtryck\" and \"Lazarus\". 2005 was a very productive year for Lundell with two albums and the novel \"Värmen\", the last part of a trilogy with \"Saknaden\" and \"Friheten\". This was the year he celebrated 30 years as an artist.\n\nIn the autumn of 2008, Lundell toured for the first time in over two years and also released his first studio album in three years. During the tour premiere of Gävle Lundell told the newspapers he was about to stop touring. The tour continued in 2009 with one in the spring and one in the summer. In connection with these he admits that he lied and will not stop touring. He explains that he is about to take farewell from his artistic career, but it's a long farewell. 2010 Lundell released a new book, \"En öppen vinter\", also containing a CD with 11 new songs.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Lundell another new tour in which he broke the audience record for a Swedish artist at Gröna Lund July 30. Audience numbers were 22 827 people and with that figure, he is only beaten by Bob Marley (32 000) and Lady Gaga (23 000).\n\nA concert tour that would have been implemented in the spring of 2011 was completely cancelled due to sickness.\n\nLundell were married the first time in 1977 to Barbro Zackrisson\n. They broke up in 1988. The year later, 1989, Lundell married Fredrika Stjärne, they broke up in 1991. He has three children from his first marriage, including the journalist Sanna Lundell, and one from the other. During the mid-1990s, he was dating the poet Isabella Nerman (whom he also wrote a song about, simply called \"Isabella\"). During a period in the 2000s he was living with Ulrika Rickfors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
