By 2012, the box office target had become \"a new benchmark for a film to be declared a hit\", and those affiliated with the 100 Crore Club were considered part of the \"elite strata\" within the Bollywood film community. It was succeeded by the 1000 Crore Club in 2017.\n\nThe first Indian film to cross worldwide was the 1982 Bollywood film \"Disco Dancer\", directed by Babbar Subhash, written by Rahi Masoom Raza, and starring Mithun Chakraborty, with over 90 crore grossed at the Soviet box office. The first Indian film to gross over 100 crore domestically in India was the Salman Khan and Madhuri Dixit starrer \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun\" (1994). The 100 Crore Club emerged more than a decade later, when the Aamir Khan starrer \"Ghajini\" (2008) became the first Indian film to net over 100 crore domestically in India, soon after which the term \"100 Crore Club\" was coined. The later Aamir Khan films \"3 Idiots\" (2009), \"Dhoom 3\" (2013), \"PK\" (2014) and \"Dangal\" (2016) expanded the club to 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 crore. Overseas, the first Indian film to gross 100 crore in international markets was the Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol starrer \"My Name is Khan\" (2010), followed by \"3 Idiots\" in 2011.\n\nWhen adjusted for inflation, the first Indian film to gross an adjusted 100 crore was the 1940 film \"Zindagi\", directed by P.C. Barua and written by Javed Hussain. The first Indian film to gross an adjusted 100 crore overseas was the 1951 film \"Awaara\", directed by Raj Kapoor, written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, and starring Raj Kapoor and Nargis, becoming a blockbuster in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn their annual awards for the year 2012, Zee Cine Awards added a category \"The Power Club Box Office\" to recognise directors whose films had reached the 100 crore mark. The 100Crore Club designation has replaced previous Bollywood indications of success which had included great music, the \"Silver Jubilee\" or the \"Diamond Jubilee\" (films that ran for 75 weeks in theatres). The concentration on reaching the club has been criticised, with actor and producer Arshad Warsi stating, \"I find this whole Rs. 100 crore club very stupid. How can every film releasing lately do a business of Rs. 100 crores all of a sudden? Instead of this, we need to concentrate on making good films.\"\n\nThe \"Hindustan Times\" claims that their magazine \"Brunch\" coined the term. Initially the term applied only to the lead male actor. Komal Nahta stated that \"excluding women from the group is characteristic of an industry which exercises gender discrimination more than other industries.\" By 2013, the usage had expanded to variously include the film itself, the director, and the lead female actor.\n\nThe 100 crore domestic box office became possible in part because of a steady rise in the ticket price, a tripling in the number of theaters and an increase in the number of prints of a film being released. However, DNA reported that \"Filmmakers and distributors too are known to leave no stone unturned in their attempt to cross over to the right side\" of the 100 crore mark.\" \"The Times of India\" cancelled its \"Box Office\" column in November 2013 because \"The stakes of filmmakers have increased so much that they are willing to go any distance to manipulate and jack up their numbers to beat each other's records.\" and the Times felt they were no longer able to provide accurate enough figures because \"Films that have not reached the '100 crore mark but are close will insist that they have reached the `100 crore figure as they can't resist being in the '100 crore club.'\"\n\nShahid Kapoor called the designation a \"fad\" which was leading to \"massy films which are very basic in their understanding and high on entertainment. But if we run only to achieve those figures then we will restrict ourselves as actors\" On the other hand, Dibakar Banerjee, while agreeing with Kapoor about the impact on content stated, \"I hope the club stays and grows to many more crores. Films as they do more business boost the confidence of audience and investors alike and everybody benefits.\" Priyanka Chopra said that being part of films in the 100 Crore Club allowed her to also do less commercial \"women oriented films\", and lamented that as of December 2013 no woman oriented films had achieved the 100 Crore Club designation.\n\nBeyond Bollywood, the first South Indian film to gross over 100 crore worldwide was 2007 Rajinikanth starring Tamil film \"Sivaji\". The first Telugu film to enter the \"100 Crore club\" was 2009 film by S.S Rajamouli, \"Magadheera\". In May 2016, \"Sairat\" become the first Marathi film to gross over worldwide. In 2016, \"Pulimurugan\" became the first Malayalam film to enter the club. \n\nVariations of the \"Bollywood 100 Crore Club\" came into use, such as the \"Bollywood 400 Crore Club\" when the Shah Rukh Khan film \"Chennai Express\" reported box office receipts of 400 crore in 2013, and the \"Tollywood 600 Crore Club\", which relates to Telugu films that have earned over in 2015 film \"\". They were eventually succeeded by the 1000 Crore Club, when \"\" and \"Dangal\" grossed over in 2017.\n\n"}

When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as limited in value due to a number of potential weaknesses, but may be considered within the scope of scientific method as some anecdotal evidence can be both empirical and verifiable, e.g. in the use of case studies in medicine. Other anecdotal evidence, however, does not qualify as scientific evidence, because its nature prevents it from being investigated by the scientific method.\n\nWhere only one or a few anecdotes are presented, there is a larger chance that they may be unreliable due to cherry-picked or otherwise non-representative samples of typical cases. Similarly, psychologists have found that due to cognitive bias people are more likely to remember notable or unusual examples rather than typical examples. Thus, even when accurate, anecdotal evidence is not necessarily representative of a typical experience. Accurate determination of whether an anecdote is typical requires statistical evidence. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an informal fallacy and is sometimes referred to as the \"person who\" fallacy (\"I know a person who...\"; \"I know of a case where...\" etc.) which places undue weight on experiences of close peers which may not be typical. Compare with hasty generalization.\n\nThe term is sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony which are uncorroborated by objective, independent evidence such as notarized documentation, photographs, audio-visual recordings, etc.\n\nWhen used in advertising or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal reports are often called a testimonial, which are highly regulated or banned in some jurisdictions.\n\nIn all forms of anecdotal evidence, its reliability by objective independent assessment may be in doubt. This is a consequence of the informal way the information is gathered, documented, presented, or any combination of the three. The term is often used to describe evidence for which there is an absence of documentation, leaving verification dependent on the credibility of the party presenting the evidence.\n\nIn science, definitions of anecdotal evidence include:\n\n\nAnecdotal evidence can have varying degrees of formality. For instance, in medicine, published anecdotal evidence by a trained observer (a doctor) is called a case report, and is subjected to formal peer review. Although such evidence is not seen as conclusive, it is sometimes regarded as an invitation to more rigorous scientific study of the phenomenon in question. For instance, one study found that 35 of 47 anecdotal reports of drug side-effects were later sustained as \"clearly correct.\"\n\nAnecdotal evidence is considered the least certain type of scientific information. Researchers may use anecdotal evidence for suggesting new hypotheses, but never as validating evidence.\n\nAnecdotal evidence is often unscientific or pseudoscientific because various forms of cognitive bias may affect the collection or presentation of evidence. For instance, someone who claims to have had an encounter with a supernatural being or alien may present a very vivid story, but this is not falsifiable. This phenomenon can also happen to large groups of people through subjective validation.\n\nAnecdotal evidence is also frequently misinterpreted via the availability heuristic, which leads to an overestimation of prevalence. Where a cause can be easily linked to an effect, people overestimate the likelihood of the cause having that effect (availability). In particular, vivid, emotionally charged anecdotes seem more plausible, and are given greater weight. A related issue is that it is usually impossible to assess for every piece of anecdotal evidence, the rate of people not reporting that anecdotal evidence in the population.\n\nA common way anecdotal evidence becomes unscientific is through fallacious reasoning such as the \"Post hoc ergo propter hoc\" fallacy, the human tendency to assume that if one event happens after another, then the first must be the cause of the second. Another fallacy involves inductive reasoning. For instance, if an anecdote illustrates a desired conclusion rather than a logical conclusion, it is considered a faulty or hasty generalization. For example, here is anecdotal evidence presented as proof of a desired conclusion:\n\nThere's abundant proof that drinking water cures cancer. Just last week I read about a girl who was dying of cancer. After drinking water she was cured.\n\nAnecdotes like this do not prove anything. In any case where some factor affects the probability of an outcome, rather than uniquely determining it, selected individual cases prove nothing; e.g. \"my grandfather smoked 40 a day until he died at 90\" and \"my sister never went near anyone who smoked but died of lung cancer\". Anecdotes often refer to the exception, rather than the rule: \"Anecdotes are useless precisely because they may point to idiosyncratic responses.\"\n\nMore generally, a statistical correlation between things does not in itself prove that one causes the other (a causal link). A study found that television viewing was strongly correlated with sugar consumption, but this does not prove that viewing causes sugar intake (or vice versa).\n\nIn medicine anecdotal evidence is also subject to placebo effects: it is well-established that a patient's (or doctor's) expectation can genuinely change the outcome of treatment. Only double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials can confirm a hypothesis about the effectiveness of a treatment independently of expectations.\n\nBy contrast, in science and logic, the \"relative strength of an explanation\" is based upon its ability to be tested or repeated, proven to be due to the stated cause, and verifiable under neutral conditions in a manner that other researchers will agree has been performed competently, and can check for themselves.\n\nWitness testimony is a common form of evidence in law, and law has mechanisms to test witness evidence for reliability or credibility. Legal processes for the taking and assessment of evidence are formalized. Some witness testimony may be described as anecdotal evidence, such as individual stories of harassment as part of a class action lawsuit. However, witness testimony can be tested and assessed for reliability. Examples of approaches to testing and assessment include the use of questioning to identify possible gaps or inconsistencies, evidence of corroborating witnesses, documents, video and forensic evidence. Where a court lacks suitable means to test and assess testimony of a particular witness, such as the absence of forms of corroboration or substantiation, it may afford that testimony limited or no \"weight\" when making a decision on the facts.\n\nIn certain situations, scientific evidence presented in court must also meet the legal requirements for evidence. For instance, in the United States, expert testimony of witnesses must meet the Daubert standard. This ruling holds that before evidence is presented to witnesses by experts, the methodology must be \"generally accepted\" among scientists. In some situations, anecdotal evidence may meet this threshold (such as certain case reports which corroborate or refute other evidence).\n\nAltman and Bland argue that the case report or statistical outlier cannot be dismissed as having no weight: \"With rare and uncommonly occurring diseases, a nonsignificant finding in a randomized trial does not necessarily mean that there is no causal association between the agent in question and the disease.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "491556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=491556", "title": "Apportionment paradox", "text": "Apportionment paradox\n\nAn apportionment paradox exists when the rules for apportionment in a political system produce results which are unexpected or seem to violate common sense.\n\nTo apportion is to divide into parts according to some rule, the rule typically being one of proportion. Certain quantities, like milk, can be divided in any proportion whatsoever; others, such as horses, cannot—only whole numbers will do. In the latter case, there is an inherent tension between the desire to obey the rule of proportion as closely as possible and the constraint restricting the size of each portion to discrete values. This results, at times, in unintuitive observations, or paradoxes.\n\nSeveral paradoxes related to apportionment, also called \"fair division\", have been identified. In some cases, simple \"post facto\" adjustments, if allowed, to an apportionment methodology can resolve observed paradoxes. However, as shown by examples relating to the United States House of Representatives, and subsequently proven by the Balinski–Young theorem, mathematics alone cannot always provide a single, fair resolution to the apportionment of remaining fractions into discrete equal whole-number parts, while complying fully with all the competing fairness elements.\n\nThe Alabama paradox was discovered in 1880, when census calculations found that if the total number of seats in the House of Representatives were hypothetically increased, this would decrease Alabama's seats from 8 to 7. An actual impact was observed in 1900, when Virginia lost a seat to Maine, even though Virginia's population was growing more rapidly: this is an example of the population paradox. In 1907, when Oklahoma became a state, New York lost a seat to Maine, thus the name \"the new state paradox\".\n\nThe method for apportionment used during this period, originally put forth by Alexander Hamilton, but vetoed by George Washington and not adopted until 1852, was as follows:\n\n\nThe Hamilton method replaced a rounding method proposed by Thomas Jefferson, and was itself replaced by the Huntington–Hill method in 1941. Under certain conditions, it too can give paradoxical results.\n\nThe Alabama paradox was the first of the apportionment paradoxes to be discovered. The US House of Representatives is constitutionally required to allocate seats based on population counts, which are required every 10 years. The size of the House is set by statute.\n\nAfter the 1880 census, C. W. Seaton, chief clerk of the United States Census Bureau, computed apportionments for all House sizes between 275 and 350, and discovered that Alabama would get eight seats with a House size of 299 but only seven with a House size of 300. In general the term \"Alabama paradox\" refers to any apportionment scenario where increasing the total number of items would decrease one of the shares. A similar exercise by the Census Bureau after the 1900 census computed apportionments for all House sizes between 350 and 400: Colorado would have received three seats in all cases, except with a House size of 357 in which case it would have received two.\n\nThe following is a simplified example (following the largest remainder method) with three states and 10 seats and 11 seats.\n\nObserve that state C's share decreases from 2 to 1 with the added seat.\n\nThis occurs because increasing the number of seats increases the fair share faster for the large states than for the small states. In particular, large A and B had their fair share increase faster than small C. Therefore, the fractional parts for A and B increased faster than those for C. In fact, they overtook C's fraction, causing C to lose its seat, since the Hamilton method examines which states have the largest remaining fraction.\n\nThe Alabama paradox is an example of violation of the resource monotonicity axiom.\n\nThe population paradox is a counterintuitive result of some procedures for apportionment. When two states have populations increasing at different rates, a small state with rapid growth can lose a legislative seat to a big state with slower growth.\n\nSome of the earlier Congressional apportionment methods, such as Hamilton, could exhibit the population paradox. In 1900, Virginia lost a seat to Maine, even though Virginia's population was growing more rapidly. However, divisor methods such as the current method do not.\n\nGiven a fixed number of total representatives (as determined by the United States House of Representatives), adding a new state would in theory \"reduce\" the number of representatives for existing states, as under the United States Constitution each state is entitled to at least one representative regardless of its population. Also, even if the number of members in the House of Representatives is increased by the number of Representatives in the new state, a pre-existing state could lose a seat because of how the particular apportionment rules deal with rounding methods. In 1907, when Oklahoma became a state, it was given a fair share of seats and the total number of seats increased by that number. The House increased from 386 to 391 members. A recomputation of apportionment affected the number of seats because of other states: New York lost a seat while Maine gained one.\n\nIn 1983, two mathematicians, Michel Balinski and Peyton Young, proved that any method of apportionment will result in paradoxes whenever there are three or more parties (or states, regions, etc.). The theorem shows that any possible method used to allocate the remaining fraction will necessarily fail to always follow quota. More precisely, their theorem states that there is no apportionment system that has the following properties (as the example we take the division of seats between parties in a system of proportional representation):\n\nMethods may have a subset of these properties, but can't have all of them:\n\nThe division of seats in an election is a prominent cultural concern. In 1876, the United States presidential election turned on the method by which the remaining fraction was calculated. Rutherford Hayes received 185 electoral college votes, and Samuel Tilden received 184. Tilden won the popular vote. With a different rounding method the final electoral college tally would have reversed. However, many mathematically analogous situations arise in which quantities are to be divided into discrete equal chunks. The Balinski–Young theorem applies in these situations: it indicates that although very reasonable approximations can be made, there is no mathematically rigorous way in which to reconcile the small remaining fraction while complying with all the competing fairness elements.\n\n\n"}

She had 3 brothers and 3 sisters. At the age of 13,[1893] she was married to Nathuji Khanderao Chaudhari. Following her husband's death,[1910] she led a very difficult life because of the economic, social, cultural, and emotional circumstances arising out of widowhood. She had a daughter named Kashi and two sons, Madhusudan and Sopandev (1907-1982).\n\nBahinabai composed her songs verbally in \"ovi\" (ओवी) metre in a mixture of two dialects: Khandesi and Varhadi. Her son Sopandev, who became a well-known poet, transcribed them. According to one account, Sopandev read the story of Savitri and Satyavan to his mother from his textbook, and by the next morning, she had composed a song of the tale. Impressed by her talent, he began writing down of her songs in a notebook. Her poetry is characterized as reflective and abstract with iconic and realist imagery. It captures the essence of her life, reflects the culture of village and farming life, and presents her wisdom.\n\nAfter his mother's death on 03 Decembar 1951, Sopandev found the notebook and shared one of her poems with Prahlād Keshav (Acharya) Atre's attention. Atre recounts calling the first of Bahinabai's poems he heard \"pure gold\" in his introduction to the collection published under the title \"Bahinabainchi gani\" [Bahinabai's Songs] in 1952 by Suchitra Prakashan.

The wife of the eldest brother is traditionally considered to have higher authority over the matters of the house, and is given the charge of running household affairs. The younger brothers’ wives traditionally seek her advice and permission in regards to many matters/decisions regarding the household, and the rearing of children. In popular culture, Hindi dramas typically display these relationships as contentious, as the \"bhabhi\" frequently abuses her position of power.\nThe term Bhabhi is also used to address a friend's wife, as a general term of respect. A bhabhi can also play the role of a mother, if both parents are dead, and in such cases the bhabhi often does raise her husband's younger siblings. She can be quite a pillar in a family. The relation between the bhabhi and the younger siblings of the husband is considered as one where a lot of humor is allowed, and the siblings, \"devar\" in case of a brother and \"nanad\" in case of a sister of the husband, may turn to the bhabhi to seek advice in personal matters, whereas they might feel shy in seeking the advice of their parents or elder\n\n"}

The catwalks provide easy access for theater personnel to perform common tasks. For example lights may need to be accessed for maintenance, position adjustment, or addition and removal of gels and gobos.\n\nTypically, catwalks are located in positions hidden from audience view or directly above an audience, and are considered \"behind-the-scenes\". For example, many proscenium theaters have a series of two or more catwalks running parallel to the proscenium arch above a false ceiling. Stairs or a ladder up to the catwalks is usually located somewhere backstage. In modern theatres, many architects design catwalks into the \"look\" of the theatre. In black box theatres, catwalks and pipe grids may be the only architectural feature.\n\nA catwalk may also be placed upstage of the proscenium as part of the fly system. These may be fixed, or they may be able to be raised and lowered.\n\nMost catwalks have several battens (pipes) that lighting fixtures may be attached to. Lights are usually attached by a C-Clamp or a hook clamp around the pipes. In addition to this primary attachment, fixtures generally have an additional safety cable attaching them to the catwalk, so that if the clamp or bolt gives way, the safety cable will catch the light. This is used because the lights are generally very expensive and heavy, but mainly to protect the audience members and performers from the possibility of fixtures falling down from the catwalks. Catwalks often include a platform for a spotlight operator to work from.\n\nA typical catwalk has a built in Electrical conduit to carry power for the lighting fixtures from the dimmers. They often hold other electrical wiring, for example standard sockets for tools, coaxial cable for projection and video monitors, built-in safety lighting to protect technicians, audio cables, and special cables for headset communications with other technicians.\n\nSince a catwalk is usually placed high above the floor, spaces where lighting instruments can go are usually chained or otherwise blocked off when a light is not present to prevent people and/or objects from falling through. The instruments themselves are attached by a safety chain to prevent them from falling. Technicians normally attach objects (such as wrenches) to themselves before going onto the catwalk, so that such objects cannot fall and possibly injure someone or damage something. This also prevents objects from falling into a place where they cannot be retrieved, such as between the catwalk floor and the ceiling, or into an HVAC vent.\n\nSometimes, to create better lighting positions or allow more flexibility, catwalks have minimal railings. Because of this, sometimes it is necessary for people working on them to wear fall arrest to satisfy safety requirements, as the railing cannot be considered sufficient.\n\n"}
{"id": "1999877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999877", "title": "Co-option", "text": "Co-option\n\nCo-option (also co-optation, sometimes spelled coöption or coöptation) has two common meanings. It may refer to the process of adding members to an elite group at the discretion of members of the body, usually to manage opposition and so maintain the stability of the group. Outsiders are ‘co-opted’ by being given a degree of power on the grounds of their élite status, specialist knowledge, or potential ability to threaten essential commitments or goals (\"formal co-optation\"). \n\nIn a classic 1979 article for \"Harvard Business Review\", consultants John Kotter and Leonard Schlesinger presented co-optation as a \"form of manipulation\" for dealing with employees who are resistant to new management programs: \n\nCo-opting an individual usually involves giving him or her a desirable role in the design or implementation of the change. Co-opting a group involves giving one of its leaders, or someone it respects, a key role in the design or implementation of a change. This is not a form of participation, however, because the initiators do not want the advice of the co-opted, merely his or her endorsement.\nCo-optation also refers to the process by which a group subsumes or acculturates a smaller or weaker group with related interests; or, similarly, the process by which one group gains converts from another group by replicating some aspects of it without adopting the full program or ideal (\"informal co-optation\"). Co-optation is associated with the cultural tactic of recuperation, and is often understood to be synonymous with it.\n\nTwo common uses of co-option are firstly, to recruit members who have specific skills or abilities needed by the group which are not available among existing members. Secondly, to fill vacancies which could not be filled by the usual process (normally election), e.g. if suitable candidates appear subsequently. Co-opted members may or may not have the same rights as the elected members of a group (such as the right to vote on motions), depending on the rules of the group. Sociologist William Gamson defined co-optation as \"challengers gaining access to the public policy process but without achieving actual policy changes.\" \n\nIf a group is elected or appointed based on its members representing specific constituencies, co-option to fill vacancies is inappropriate, as a member selected by existing members will not necessarily represent the interests of the group represented by the vacating member. In this case, vacancies may be filled via a mechanism specified in its rules, such as a by-election. Examples are:\n\nSociologist Philip Selznick, in the context of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), described this form as \"formal co-optation\" (he used the term \"cooptation\"). \n\nThis is arguably a derivation from the first sense. The outcome of such co-option will be specific to the individual case, and will depend on the relative strength of the co-opting and co-opted groups, the degree of alignment of their interests, and the vigour with which their members are prepared to pursue those interests. For example, when corporations greenwash their brands by co-opting the tone of environmentalism without any deep reform of their environmental impact, both environmental advocates and the general public must decide how to engage (or not) with the greenwashed result (accept it wholly, boycott it, apply pressure from another angle, ignore it, or some other path).\n\nSelznick, again in the context of the Tennessee Valley Authority, described this form as \"informal co-optation\", although the process he describes is almost indistinguishable from the corrupt sale of political influence.\n\n"}

He did his primary schooling at the Kodenchery Dars religious seminary before moving to Vazhakkad. After completing his studies at the Vazhakkad Darul Uloom Arabic college under the tutelage of Chalilakath Kunhahammad Haji, he joined the Indian National Movement from 1919 onwards. As a skilled orator and organizer, he was instrumental in drawing Mohammed Abdul Rahiman into the Indian Independence movement. He was the founding secretary of the \"Majlisul Ulema\", an organization formed for social reform amongst the Mappila community and to draw their participation in the Indian National Movement.

The development of eco-municipalities stems from changing systems in Sweden, where more than seventy municipal governments have accepted varying principles of sustainability in their operations as well as community-wide decision making processes. The purpose of these policies is to increase the overall sustainability of the community.\n\nThe distinction between an eco-municipality and other sustainable development projects (such as green building and alternative energy) is the focus on community involvement and social transformation in a public agency as well as the use of a holistic systems approach. An eco-municipality is one that recognizes that issues of sustainability are key to all decisions made by government. \n\nIn 1983 the Övertorneå community of Sweden first adopted an Eco-municipality framework followed by a formal organization in 1995 (SEKOM).\n\nIn becoming an eco-municipality, cities or towns typically adopt a resolution, based on the Natural Step framework (or Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD)), which sets the following objectives:\n\nCommunities in North America, Europe and Africa ranging in size from villages of 300 to cities of 700,000 have become eco-municipalities. In Sweden, over one hundred municipalities have officially become eco-municipalities. They have formed a national association of eco-municipalities to assist one another and work to influence national policy. Whistler, BC, was awarded first place in a United Nations-endorsed international competition for sustainable communities. Its long-term sustainability plan, Whistler 2020, is based on the Natural Step framework.\n\nIn Wisconsin, there is a growing eco-municipality movement which began in the Chequamegon Bay region. As of November 2007, twelve local communities had formally adopted eco-municipality resolutions. The resolutions state the community's intention to become an eco-municipality, endorsing the Natural Step sustainability principles and framework as a guide.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "947774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=947774", "title": "English phonology", "text": "English phonology\n\nLike many other languages, English has wide variation in pronunciation, both historically and from dialect to dialect. In general, however, the regional dialects of English share a largely similar (but not identical) phonological system. Among other things, most dialects have vowel reduction in unstressed syllables and a complex set of phonological features that distinguish fortis and lenis consonants (stops, affricates, and fricatives). Most dialects of English preserve the consonant (spelled ) and many preserve (spelled ), while most other Germanic languages have shifted them to and : compare English \"will\" and \"then\" with German ('want') and ('because').\n\nPhonological analysis of English often concentrates on or uses, as a reference point, one or more of the prestige or standard accents, such as Received Pronunciation for England, General American for the United States, and General Australian for Australia. Nevertheless, many other dialects of English are spoken, which have developed independently from these standardized accents, particularly regional dialects. Information about these standardized accents functions only as a \"limited\" guide to all of English phonology, which one can later expand upon once one becomes more familiar with some of the many other dialects of English that are spoken.\n\nA phoneme of a language or dialect is an abstraction of a speech sound or of a group of different sounds which are all perceived to have the same function by speakers of that particular language or dialect. For example, the English word \"through\" consists of three phonemes: the initial \"th\" sound, the \"r\" sound, and a vowel sound. The phonemes in this and many other English words do not always correspond directly to the letters used to spell them (English orthography is not as strongly phonemic as that of many other languages).\n\nThe number and distribution of phonemes in English vary from dialect to dialect, and also depend on the interpretation of the individual researcher. The number of consonant phonemes is generally put at 24 (or slightly more). The number of vowels is subject to greater variation; in the system presented on this page there are 20 vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation, 14–16 in General American and 20–21 in Australian English . The pronunciation keys used in dictionaries generally contain a slightly greater number of symbols than this, to take account of certain sounds used in foreign words and certain noticeable distinctions that may not be—strictly speaking—phonemic.\n\nThe following table shows the 24 consonant phonemes found in most dialects of English, in addition to , whose distribution is more limited. Fortis consonants are always voiceless, aspirated in syllable onset (except in clusters beginning with ), and sometimes also glottalized to an extent in syllable coda (most likely to occur with , see T-glottalization), while lenis consonants are always unaspirated and un-glottalized, and generally partially or fully voiced. The alveolars are usually apical, i.e. pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching or approaching the roof of the mouth, though some speakers produce them laminally, i.e. with the blade of the tongue.\n\n\nThe following table shows typical examples of the occurrence of the above consonant phonemes in words.\n\n\nIn most dialects, the fortis stops and affricate have various different allophones, and are distinguished from the lenis stops and affricate by several phonetic features.\n\nEnglish has a particularly large number of vowel phonemes, and on top of that the vowels of English differ considerably between dialects. Because of this, corresponding vowels may be transcribed with various symbols depending on the dialect under consideration. When considering English as a whole, lexical sets are often used, each named by a word containing the vowel or vowels in question. For example, the set consists of words which, like \"lot\", have in Received Pronunciation and in General American. The \" vowel\" then refers to the vowel that appears in those words in whichever dialect is being considered, or (at a greater level of abstraction) to a diaphoneme, which represents this interdialectal correspondence. A commonly used system of lexical sets, devised by John C. Wells, is presented below; for each set, the corresponding phonemes are given for RP and General American, using the notation that will be used on this page.\n\nFor a table that shows the pronunciations of these vowels in a wider range of English dialects, see IPA chart for English dialects.\n\nThe following tables show the vowel phonemes of three standard varieties of English. The notation system used here for Received Pronunciation (RP) is fairly standard; the others less so. The feature descriptions given here (front, close, etc.) are abstracted somewhat; the actual pronunciations of these vowels are somewhat more accurately conveyed by the IPA symbols used (see Vowel for a chart indicating the meanings of these symbols; though note also the points listed below the following tables).\n\n\nThe differences between these tables can be explained as follows:\n\nOther points to be noted are these:\n\nListed here are some of the significant cases of allophony of vowels found within standard English dialects.\n\nUnstressed syllables in English may contain almost any vowel, but in practice vowels in stressed and unstressed syllables tend to use different inventories of phonemes. In particular, long vowels are used less often in unstressed syllables than stressed syllables. Additionally there are certain sounds—characterized by central position and weakness—that are particularly often found as the nuclei of unstressed syllables. These include:\n\nVowel reduction in unstressed syllables is a significant feature of English. Syllables of the types listed above often correspond to a syllable containing a different vowel (\"full vowel\") used in other forms of the same morpheme where that syllable is stressed. For example, the first \"o\" in \"photograph\", being stressed, is pronounced with the vowel, but in \"photography\", where it is unstressed, it is reduced to schwa. Also, certain common words (\"a\", \"an\", \"of\", \"for\", etc.) are pronounced with a schwa when they are unstressed, although they have different vowels when they are in a stressed position (see Weak and strong forms in English).\n\nSome unstressed syllables, however, retain full (unreduced) vowels, i.e. vowels other than those listed above. Examples are the in ambition\" and the in \"finite\". Some phonologists regard such syllables as not being fully unstressed (they may describe them as having \"tertiary stress\"); some dictionaries have marked such syllables as having secondary stress. However linguists such as Ladefoged and regard this as a difference purely of vowel quality and not of stress, and thus argue that vowel reduction itself is phonemic in English. Examples of words where vowel reduction seems to be distinctive for some speakers include \"chickaree vs. \"chicory (the latter has the reduced vowel of , whereas the former has the vowel without reduction), and \"Pharaoh vs. \"farrow\" (both have the vowel, but in the latter word it may reduce to ).\n\nLexical stress is phonemic in English. For example, the noun increase\" and the verb \"increase are distinguished by the positioning of the stress on the first syllable in the former, and on the second syllable in the latter. (See initial-stress-derived noun.) Stressed syllables in English are louder than non-stressed syllables, as well as being longer and having a higher pitch.\n\nIn traditional approaches, in any English word consisting of more than one syllable, each syllable is ascribed one of three degrees of stress: \"primary\", \"secondary\" or \"unstressed\". Ordinarily, in each such word there will be exactly one syllable with primary stress, possibly one syllable having secondary stress, and the remainder are unstressed. For example, the word \"amazing\" has primary stress on the second syllable, while the first and third syllables are unstressed, whereas the word \"organization\" has primary stress on the fourth syllable, secondary stress on the first, and the second, third and fifth unstressed. This is often shown in pronunciation keys using the IPA symbols for primary and secondary stress (which are ˈ and ˌ respectively), placed before the syllables to which they apply. The two words just given may therefore be represented (in RP) as and .\n\nSome analysts identify an additional level of stress (\"tertiary\" stress). This is generally ascribed to syllables that are pronounced with less force than those with secondary stress, but nonetheless contain a \"full\" or \"unreduced\" vowel (vowels that are considered to be reduced are listed under above). Hence the third syllable of \"organization\", if pronounced with as shown above (rather than being reduced to or ), might be said to have tertiary stress. (The precise identification of secondary and tertiary stress differs between analyses; dictionaries do not generally show tertiary stress, although some have taken the approach of marking all syllables with unreduced vowels as having at least secondary stress.)\n\nIn some analyses, then, the concept of lexical stress may become conflated with that of vowel reduction. An approach which attempts to separate these two is provided by Peter Ladefoged, who states that it is possible to describe English with only one degree of stress, as long as unstressed syllables are phonemically distinguished for vowel reduction. In this approach, the distinction between primary and secondary stress is regarded as a phonetic or prosodic detail rather than a phonemic feature – primary stress is seen as an example of the predictable \"tonic\" stress that falls on the \"final\" stressed syllable of a prosodic unit. For more details of this analysis, see Stress and vowel reduction in English.\n\nFor stress as a prosodic feature (emphasis of particular words within utterances), see below.\n\nPhonotactics is the study of the sequences of phonemes that occur in languages and the sound structures that they form. In this study it is usual to represent consonants in general with the letter C and vowels with the letter V, so that a syllable such as 'be' is described as having CV structure. The IPA symbol used to show a division between syllables is the dot . Syllabification is the process of dividing continuous speech into discrete syllables, a process in which the position of a syllable division is not always easy to decide upon.\n\nMost languages of the world syllabify and sequences as and or , with consonants preferentially acting as the onset of a syllable containing the following vowel. According to one view, English is unusual in this regard, in that stressed syllables attract following consonants, so that and syllabify as and , as long as the consonant cluster is a possible syllable coda; in addition, preferentially syllabifies with the preceding vowel even when both syllables are unstressed, so that occurs as . This is the analysis used in the \"Longman Pronunciation Dictionary\". However, this view is not widely accepted, as explained in the following section.\n\nThe syllable structure in English is (C)V(C), with a near maximal example being \"strengths\" (, although it can be pronounced ). From the phonetic point of view, the analysis of syllable structures is a complex task: because of widespread occurrences of articulatory overlap, English speakers rarely produce an audible release of individual consonants in consonant clusters. This coarticulation can lead to articulatory gestures that seem very much like deletions or complete assimilations. For example, \"hundred pounds\" may sound like and \"jumped back\" (in slow speech, ) may sound like , but X-ray and electropalatographic studies demonstrate that inaudible and possibly weakened contacts or lingual gestures may still be made. Thus the second in \"hundred pounds\" does not entirely assimilate to a labial place of articulation, rather the labial gesture co-occurs with the alveolar one; the \"missing\" in \"jumped back\" may still be articulated, though not heard.\n\nDivision into syllables is a difficult area, and different theories have been proposed. A widely accepted approach is the maximal onset principle: this states that, subject to certain constraints, any consonants in between vowels should be assigned to the following syllable. Thus the word \"leaving\" should be divided rather than *, and \"hasty\" is rather than * or *. However, when such a division results in an onset cluster which is not allowed in English, the division must respect this. Thus if the word \"extra\" were divided * the resulting onset of the second syllable would be , a cluster which does not occur initially in English. The division is therefore preferred. If assigning a consonant or consonants to the following syllable would result in the preceding syllable ending in an unreduced short vowel, this is avoided. Thus the word \"comma\" (in RP) should be divided and not *, even though the latter division gives the maximal onset to the following syllable.\n\nIn some cases, no solution is completely satisfactory: for example, in British English (RP) the word \"hurry\" could be divided or , but the former would result in an analysis with a syllable-final (which is held to be non-occurring) while the latter would result in a syllable final (which is said not to occur in this accent). Some phonologists have suggested a compromise analysis where the consonant in the middle belongs to both syllables, and is described as ambisyllabic. In this way, it is possible to suggest an analysis of \"hurry\" which comprises the syllables and , the medial being ambisyllabic. \nWhere the division coincides with a word boundary, or the boundary between elements of a compound word, it is not usual in the case of dictionaries to insist on the maximal onset principle in a way that divides words in a counter-intuitive way; thus the word \"hardware\" would be divided by the M.O.P., but dictionaries prefer the division .\n\nIn the approach used by the \"Longman Pronunciation Dictionary\", Wells claims that consonants syllabify with the preceding rather than following vowel when the preceding vowel is the nucleus of a more salient syllable, with stressed syllables being the most salient, reduced syllables the least, and full unstressed vowels (\"secondary stress\") intermediate. But there are lexical differences as well, frequently but not exclusively with compound words. For example, in \"dolphin\" and \"selfish,\" Wells argues that the stressed syllable ends in , but in \"shellfish,\" the belongs with the following syllable: → , but → , where the is a little longer and the is not reduced. Similarly, in \"toe-strap\" Wells argues that the second is a full plosive, as usual in syllable onset, whereas in \"toast-rack\" the second is in many dialects reduced to the unreleased allophone it takes in syllable codas, or even elided: → ; likewise \"nitrate\" → with a voiceless (and for some people an affricated \"tr\" as in \"tree\"), vs \"night-rate\" → with a voiced . Cues of syllable boundaries include aspiration of syllable onsets and (in the US) flapping of coda \"(a tease\" → vs. \"at ease\" → ), epenthetic stops like in syllable codas (\"fence\" → but \"inside\" → ), and r-colored vowels when the is in the coda vs. labialization when it is in the onset \"(key-ring\" → but \"fearing\" → ).\n\nThe following can occur as the onset:\n\nNotes:\n\nCertain English onsets appear only in contractions: e.g. (\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>sblood\"), and or (\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>swounds\" or \"<nowiki>'</nowiki>dswounds\"). Some, such as (\"pshaw\"), (\"fwoosh\"), or (\"vroom\"), can occur in interjections. An archaic voiceless fricative plus nasal exists, (\"fnese\"), as does an archaic (\"snew\").\n\nSeveral additional onsets occur in loan words (with varying degrees of anglicization) such as (\"bwana\"), (\"moiré\"), (\"noire\"), (\"zwitterion\"), (\"zwieback\"), (\"Dvorak\"), (\"kvetch\"), (\"schvartze\"), (\"Tver\"), (\"Zwickau\"), (\"Kjell\"), (\"Kshatriya\"), (\"Tlaloc\"), (\"Vladimir\"), (\"zloty\"), (\"Tskhinvali\"), (\"Hmong\"), and (\"Khmer\").\n\nSome clusters of this type can be converted to regular English phonotactics by simplifying the cluster: e.g. (\"dziggetai\"), (\"Hrolf\"), (\"croissant\"), (\"Nguyen\"), (\"pfennig\"), (\"phthalic\"), (\"tsunami\"), (\"!kung\"), and (\"Xhosa\").\n\nOthers can be replaced by native clusters differing only in voice: (\"sbirro\"), and (\"sgraffito\").\n\nThe following can occur as the nucleus:\n\nMost (in theory, all) of the following except those that end with , , , , or can be extended with or representing the morpheme -s/-z. Similarly, most (in theory, all) of the following except those that end with or can be extended with or representing the morpheme -t/-d.\n\nNote: For some speakers, a fricative before is elided so that these never appear phonetically: becomes , becomes , becomes .\n\n\n\nThe prosodic features of English – stress, rhythm, and intonation – can be described as follows.\n\nProsodic stress is extra stress given to words or syllables when they appear in certain positions in an utterance, or when they receive special emphasis.\n\nAccording to Ladefoged's analysis (as referred to under above), English normally has prosodic stress on the final stressed syllable in an intonation unit. This is said to be the origin of the distinction traditionally made at the lexical level between primary and secondary stress: when a word like \"admiration\" (traditionally transcribed as something like ) is spoken in isolation, or at the end of a sentence, the syllable \"ra\" (the final stressed syllable) is pronounced with greater force than the syllable \"ad\", although when the word is not pronounced with this final intonation there may be no difference between the levels of stress of these two syllables.\n\nProsodic stress can shift for various pragmatic functions, such as focus or contrast. For instance, in the dialogue \"Is it brunch tomorrow? No, it's dinner tomorrow\", the extra stress shifts from the last stressed syllable of the sentence, \"tomorrow\", to the last stressed syllable of the emphasized word, \"dinner.\"\n\nGrammatical function words are usually prosodically unstressed, although they can acquire stress when emphasized (as in \"Did you find the cat? Well, I found a cat\"). Many English function words have distinct strong and weak pronunciations; for example, the word \"a\" in the last example is pronounced , while the more common unstressed \"a\" is pronounced . See Weak and strong forms in English.\n\nEnglish is claimed to be a \"stress-timed\" language. That is, stressed syllables tend to appear with a more or less regular rhythm, while non-stressed syllables are shortened to accommodate this. For example, in the sentence \"One make of car is better than another\", the syllables \"one\", \"make\", \"car\", \"bett-\" and ' will be stressed and relatively long, while the other syllables will be considerably shorter. The theory of stress-timing predicts that each of the three unstressed syllables in between \"bett-\" and ' will be shorter than the syllable \"of\" between \"make\" and \"car\", because three syllables must fit into the same amount of time as that available for \"of\". However, it should not be assumed that all varieties of English are stress-timed in this way. The English spoken in the West Indies, in Africa and in India are probably better characterized as syllable-timed, though the lack of an agreed scientific test for categorizing an accent or language as stress-timed or syllable-timed may lead one to doubt the value of such a characterization.\n\nPhonological contrasts in intonation can be said to be found in three different and independent domains. In the work of Halliday the following names are proposed:\n\n\nThese terms (\"the Three Ts\") have been used in more recent work, though they have been criticized for being difficult to remember. American systems such as ToBI also identify contrasts involving boundaries between intonation phrases (Halliday's \"tonality\"), placement of pitch accent (\"tonicity\"), and choice of tone or tones associated with the pitch accent (\"tone\").\n\nExample of phonological contrast involving placement of intonation unit boundaries (boundary marked by |):\nExample of phonological contrast involving placement of tonic syllable (marked by capital letters):\nExample of phonological contrast (British English) involving choice of tone (\\ = falling tone, \\/ = fall-rise tone)\nThere is typically a contrast involving tone between wh-questions and yes/no questions, the former having a falling tone (e.g. \"Where did you \\PUT it?\") and the latter a rising tone (e.g. \"Are you going /OUT?\"), though studies of spontaneous speech have shown frequent exceptions to this rule. Tag questions asking for information are said to carry rising tones (e.g. \"They are coming on Tuesday, /AREN'T they?\") while those asking for confirmation have falling tone (e.g. \"Your name's John, \\ISN'T it.\").\n\nThe pronunciation system of English has undergone many changes throughout the history of the language, from the phonological system of Old English, to that of Middle English, through to that of the present day. Variation between dialects has always been significant. Former pronunciations of many words are reflected in their spellings, as English orthography has generally not kept pace with phonological changes since the Middle English period.\n\nThe English consonant system has been relatively stable over time, although a number of significant changes have occurred. Examples include the loss (in most dialects) of the and sounds still reflected by the in words like \"night\" and \"taught\", and the splitting of voiced and voiceless allophones of fricatives into separate phonemes (such as the two different phonemes represented by). There have also been many changes in consonant clusters, mostly reductions, for instance those that produced the usual modern pronunciations of such letter combinations as , and .\n\nThe development of vowels has been much more complex. One of the most notable series of changes is that known as the Great Vowel Shift, which began around the late 14th century. Here the and in words like \"price\" and \"mouth\" became diphthongized, and other long vowels became higher: became (as in \"meet\"), became and later (as in \"name\"), became (as in \"goose\"), and became and later (in RP now ; as in \"bone\"). These shifts are responsible for the modern pronunciations of many written vowel combinations, including those involving a silent final.\n\nMany other changes in vowels have taken place over the centuries (see the separate articles on the low back, high back and high front vowels, short A, and diphthongs). These various changes mean that many words that formerly rhymed (and may be expected to rhyme based on their spelling) no longer do. For example, in Shakespeare's time, following the Great Vowel Shift, \"food\", \"good\" and \"blood\" all had the vowel , but in modern pronunciation \"good\" has been shortened to , while \"blood\" has been shortened and lowered to in most accents. In other cases, words that were formerly distinct have come to be pronounced the same – examples of such mergers include \"meet–meat\", \"pane–pain\" and \"toe–tow\".\n\n\n"}

The term has gained popularity in social media, and is mostly used by community activists and in higher education settings by students, faculty, staff, and some administrators who seek to advocate for individuals living on the borderlines of gender identity. According to Google Trends, interest in the term spiked in 2016. The term appears in print, also in 2016, in the context of LGBT studies.\n\nA 2016 NBC News report noted that it was \"difficult to pinpoint\" the origins of the term, but found \"anecdotal evidence\" that the term was in use in Latin America. The same report stated that usage of the term was \"without question on the rise at U.S. colleges\". Oberlin College, New York University, Central Washington University, and Colorado State University are among the academic institutions that have advertised events using the word \"Latinx\".\n\nAt Princeton University, a student group called the Princeton University Latinx Perspective Organization was founded in 2016 to \"unify Princeton's diverse Latinx community\". As of 2017, several student-run organizations at other institutions have utilized the word in their title.\n\nSalinas and Lozano (2017) stated that the term is influenced by Mexican indigenous communities. Scharrón-del Río and Aja (2015) have traced the use of Latinx in authors Beatriz Llenin Figueroa, Jaime Géliga Quiñones, Yuderkys Espinosa Miñoso and Adriana Gallegos Dextre. The term has also been discussed in publications by Pastrana (2016), Battle (2016) and Valdes (2017).\n\nThe term \"Latinx\" has been the subject of controversy. In an article for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Daniel Hernandez wrote \"Like many of its awkward predecessors, 'Latinx' does not work. Its experimental 'x' opens too many linguistic floodgates. And why is this kind of label necessary at all?\"\n\nAn article on \"HuffPost\" stated, \"Despite the growing popularity of the term, \"Latinx\" has been faced with criticism. Many opponents of the term have suggested that using an un-gendered noun like \"Latinx\" is disrespectful to the Spanish language and some have even called the term \"a blatant form of linguistic imperialism.\" Some refuse to use the term as \"\"Latinx\" doesn't roll off the tongue in the Spanish language.\"\n\nHowever, in defense of the term, Brooklyn College professors María R. Scharrón-del Río and Alan A. Aja argue that the Spanish language itself is a form of linguistic imperialism for Latin Americans.\n\nHector Luis Alamo wrote in an article for \"Latino Rebels\", \"If we dump \"Latino\" for \"Latinx\" because it offends some people, then we should go on dumping words forever since there will always be some people who find some words offensive. No word ever oppressed anybody (except maybe the word \"God\").\"\n\nNicole Trujillo-Pagán considers patriarchal bias is reproduced in ostensibly \"gender neutral\" language and asserts, \"Less clear in the debate (as it has developed since then) is how the replacement silences and erases long-standing struggles to recognize the significance of gender difference and sexual violence.\"\n\nAn alternative term is \"Latin@\" (pronounced \"Latínao\") where the postfixed is taken to represent a combination of and in a single character. This variant is somewhat older, in use since the 1990s. It has received criticism for adhering to a binary view of gender.\n\nAnother, more recent, variant is \"Latine\", where the vowel is taken as a \"neutral\" alternative to either or . Proponents of \"Latine\" say it sounds more natural and grammatical to native Spanish speakers.\n\n"}

They are generally available to buy in main post offices about two weeks prior to the release of each new set of stamps.\n\nThe 'PHQ' stands for Postal Headquarters. All items published by the Post Office are given a number which is prefixed by letters. The first card issued, on 16 May 1973, was numbered PHQ1, and the numbering sequence has continued to the present day.\n\nThere are however two gaps in the sequence, and two duplications. The number PHQ24 was originally set aside for the 9p Silver Jubilee card (issued after the rest of the set), but when it was issued the card was numbered PHQ22E. The next set (Wildlife cards, issued 5 October 1977) had already been allocated the number PHQ25, and so the number PHQ24 was never used.\n\nThe London 1980 Exhibition card, issued 9 April 1980 to commemorate the 1980 International Stamp Exhibition, and the set of five cards for London Landmarks, issued 7 May 1980, both had the reference number PHQ43.\n\nThe set of five cards for Gallantry, issued 11 September 1990, and the set of four cards for Astronomy, issued 16 October 1990, both had the reference number PHQ129. Consequently, the number PHQ130 was unused.\n\nThe first card issued was the 3p W.G. Grace stamp from the set of stamps commemorating County Cricket, issued on 16 May 1973, but not released until mid-July. Subsequent cards have been issued about two weeks prior to the release of the stamps. This enables collectors to obtain the cards before the issue of the stamps so that they can attach the relevant stamp and obtain First Day of Issue postmarks.\n\nWhen they were first issued, the PHQ cards were intended to be just an occasional picture postcard for sale to the public at Post Offices and Philatelic Counters. However, right from the first card issued, some enterprising Stamp Dealers realised that there was a potential new Stamp collecting area, and stamps were fixed either to the face of the card, or the back, and postmarks for various cricket matches played between July and September 1973 were obtained.\n\nIn August 1973 a second card was issued for one of the stamps in the set to mark the 400th anniversary of the birth of Inigo Jones, architect and designer. Over the next three years several more single cards, and a few sets were issued, from July 1976 onwards there has been a set of cards issued for every new set of commemorative stamps that has been issued.\n\nThe first two cards issued, 1973 Cricket and 1973 Inigo Jones, are larger than the current cards, measuring 120 mm x 172 mm in size, while all cards issued from PHQ3 onward are 104 mm x 148 mm in size. This can be confusing for new collectors coming across the first two issues for the first time, if they are not aware of the size difference, they tend to think they are worthless copies.\n\nThere are three main areas of collecting interest. Many collectors like to collect only the unused cards, but some like to obtain them with first day of issue postmarks. Others like to obtain them with special handstamps that have some connection to the stamp subject matter.\nAlso, stamp collectors will usually put the stamp on the back of the card, but a very popular variation is for the stamp to be applied to the face of the card, so that the postcard picture, stamp and postmark are all visible on the same face.\n\nThe first card was not put on sale until two months after the issue date of the stamps, so would not have been eligible for a First day of issue postmark. However the card is known to exist with 16 May 1973, Birmingham FDI cancellation (back-dated by favour), but it is much more collectable with the July and September pictorial cricket postmarks.\nThe cricket postmarks to look out for are 21 July, Benson & Hedges, and 1 September Gillette Cup.\n\nBelow are the issue dates of all the early cards, issued up until July 1976. Since this date a full set of cards has been issued for every commemorative set, and for some of the definitive issues.\n\nAll subsequent issues of British Commemorative Stamps had a set of PHQ Cards issued.\n\nLike the stamps they depict, because of the printing processes involved, errors and differences will occur in the printings. Some of the notable differences and errors are listed here.\n\nOccasionally the post office issues Stamp Cards of stamps that are not listed as PHQ. This also includes copies of Definitive Issues.\n\n"}

He wrote under a variety of \"noms de plume\": A. Cvingelis, Cezaris Petrėnas, J. K. Pavilionis, K. Cvirka, Kanapeikus, Kazys Gerutis, Klangis, Klangis Petras, Klangių Petras, L. P. Cvirka, Laumakys, P. Cvinglis, P. Cvirka-Rymantas, P. Gelmė, P. Veliuoniškis, Petras Serapinas, and S. Laumakys. His works have been translated into Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, English, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Polish, Romanian, and Uzbek.\n\nCvirka attended an art school in Kaunas between 1926 and 1930. However, after graduation he drifted away from visual arts to literature. He began publishing poetry in 1924 and studied literature in Paris during 1931 and 1932. He translated 9 books and 34 shorter works from French into Lithuanian. Later in the decade he travelled to Moscow, Leningrad, and western Europe. He joined the Communist Party in 1940 and supported Lithuania's incorporation into the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1941, following the outbreak of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, he moved to Alma-Ata and then Moscow, joining the Union of Writers of the USSR. Returning to Lithuania in 1944, he went on to serve as chairman of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic's Writer's Union and as editor of the journal \"Pergalė\" (Victory). After Cvirka's death in 1947, the Soviet authorities erected a monument to his memory in Vilnius. This monument became the object of controversy after the restoration of independence in 1990 due to Cvirka's pro-communist activities. There were calls for its removal.\n\nCvirka's works combine biting commentary on social issues with keen feelings for the natural world. His works are also known for their wit and strong dialogue. The novel \"Meisteris ir sūnūs\" depicts the folk art of Lithuania in a new way. It incorporates plentiful folkloric and ethnographic details of Lithuanian village life and attempts to translate rich oral traditions into the written medium. A prominent example of socialist realism, the novel \"Žemė maitintoja\" depicts an ideal new socialist man. The protagonist is a young, non-religious, determined farmer, who received his land as a result of the land reform when estates of former nobility were divided among the poor. He has no emotional attachment to his land, rather perceiving the economic benefits of collective farming. This is an example of a person who needs to be created by communism. The two-volume \"Frank Kruk\" is a satirical novel about Pranas Krukelis, a Lithuanian immigrant to the United States who Americanizes his name to Frank Kruk. Krukelis engages in criminal activity and exploits other Lithuanian immigrants. A theatrical adaptation was staged in Klaipėda in 2003; Vytautas Paukštė received the Lithuanian National Prize for his portrayal of Kruk. Cvirka was the first writer to address the Lithuanian partisans – anti-Soviet guerrilla fighters – in the short story \"Pabučiavimas\", one of his last works.\n\n"}

Informally, it says that all sufficiently long words in a regular language may be \"pumped\"—that is, have a middle section of the word repeated an arbitrary number of times—to produce a new word that also lies within the same language.\n\nSpecifically, the pumping lemma says that for any regular language formula_1 there exists a constant formula_2 such that any word formula_3 in formula_1 with length at least formula_2 can be split into three substrings, formula_6, where the middle portion formula_7 must not be empty, such that the words formula_8 constructed by repeating formula_7 zero or more times are still in formula_1. This process of repetition is known as \"pumping\". Moreover, the pumping lemma guarantees that the length of formula_11 will be at most formula_2, imposing a limit on the ways in which formula_3 may be split. Finite languages vacuously satisfy the pumping lemma by having formula_2 equal to the maximum string length in formula_1 plus one.\n\nThe pumping lemma is useful for disproving the regularity of a specific language in question. It was first proven by Michael Rabin and Dana Scott in 1959, and rediscovered shortly after by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, Micha A. Perles, and Eli Shamir in 1961, as a simplification of their pumping lemma for context-free languages.\n\nLet formula_1 be a regular language. Then there exists an integer formula_17 depending only on formula_1 such that every string formula_3 in formula_1 of length at least formula_2 (formula_2 is called the \"pumping length\") can be written as formula_6 (i.e., formula_3 can be divided into three substrings), satisfying the following conditions:\n\n\nformula_7 is the substring that can be pumped (removed or repeated any number of times, and the resulting string is always in formula_1). (1) means the loop formula_7 to be pumped must be of length at least one; (2) means the loop must occur within the first formula_2 characters. |\"x\"| must be smaller than formula_2 (conclusion of (1) and (2)), but apart from that, there is no restriction on formula_33 and formula_34.\n\nIn simple words, for any regular language formula_1, any sufficiently long word formula_3 (in formula_1) can be split into 3 parts.\ni.e. formula_6 , such that all the strings formula_39 for formula_40 are also in formula_1.\n\nBelow is a formal expression of the Pumping Lemma.\n\nformula_42\n\nThe pumping lemma is often used to prove that a particular language is non-regular: a proof by contradiction (of the language's regularity) may consist of exhibiting a word (of the required length) in the language that lacks the property outlined in the pumping lemma.\n\nFor example, the language formula_43 over the alphabet formula_44 can be shown to be non-regular as follows:\n\nLet formula_45, and formula_46 be as used in the formal statement for the pumping lemma above. We assume that there exists some constant formula_2. Let formula_3 in formula_1 be given by formula_50, which is a string longer than formula_2. By the pumping lemma, there must be some decomposition formula_6 with formula_53 and formula_54 such that\nformula_55 in formula_1 for every formula_57. Using formula_53, we know formula_7 only consists of instances of formula_60. Moreover, because formula_54, it contains at least one instance of the letter formula_60. We now pump formula_7 up: formula_64 has more instances of the letter formula_60 than the letter formula_66, since we have added some instances of formula_60 without adding instances of formula_66. Therefore, formula_64 is not in formula_1. We have reached a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that formula_1 is regular (i.e. there exists such a formula_2) must be incorrect. Hence formula_1 is not regular.\n\nThe proof that the language of balanced (i.e., properly nested) parentheses is not regular follows the same idea. Given formula_2, there is a string of balanced parentheses that begins with more than formula_2 left parentheses, so that formula_7 will consist entirely of left parentheses. By repeating formula_7, we can produce a string that does not contain the same number of left and right parentheses, and so they cannot be balanced.\n\nFor every regular language there is a finite state automaton (FSA) that accepts the language. The number of states in such an FSA are counted and that count is used as the pumping length formula_2. For a string of length at least formula_2, let formula_80 be the start state and let formula_81 be the sequence of the next formula_2 states visited as the string is emitted. Because the FSA has only formula_2 states, within this sequence of formula_84 visited states there must be at least one state that is repeated. Write formula_85 for such a state. The transitions that take the machine from the first encounter of state formula_85 to the second encounter of state formula_85 match some string. This string is called formula_7 in the lemma, and since the machine will match a string without the formula_7 portion, or with the string formula_7 repeated any number of times, the conditions of the lemma are satisfied.\n\nFor example, the following image shows an FSA.\n\nThe FSA accepts the string: abcd. Since this string has a length at least as large as the number of states, which is four, the pigeonhole principle indicates that there must be at least one repeated state among the start state and the next four visited states. In this example, only formula_91 is a repeated state. Since the substring bc takes the machine through transitions that start at state formula_91 and end at state formula_91, that portion could be repeated and the FSA would still accept, giving the string abcbcd. Alternatively, the bc portion could be removed and the FSA would still accept giving the string ad. In terms of the pumping lemma, the string abcd is broken into an formula_33 portion a, a formula_7 portion bc and a formula_34 portion d.\n\nIf a language formula_1 is regular, then there exists a number formula_17 (the pumping length) such that every string formula_99 in formula_1 with |\"w\"| ≥ \"p\" can be written in the form \nwith strings \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\" such that |\"xy\"| ≤ \"p\", |\"y\"| ≥ 1 and\nFrom this, the above standard version follows a special case, with both formula_105 and formula_106 being the empty string.\n\nSince the general version imposes stricter requirements on the language, it can be used to prove the non-regularity of many more languages, such as formula_107.\n\nWhile the pumping lemma states that all regular languages satisfy the conditions described above, the converse of this statement is not true: a language that satisfies these conditions may still be non-regular. In other words, both the original and the general version of the pumping lemma give a \"necessary\" but not \"sufficient\" condition for a language to be regular.\n\nFor example, consider the following language:\nIn other words, formula_1 contains all strings over the alphabet formula_110 with a substring of length 3 including a duplicate character, as well as all strings over this alphabet where precisely 1/7 of the string's characters are 3's. This language is not regular but can still be \"pumped\" with formula_111. Suppose some string \"s\" has length at least 5. Then, since the alphabet has only four characters, at least two of the first five characters in the string must be duplicates. They are separated by at most three characters.\n\nThe Myhill–Nerode theorem provides a test that exactly characterizes regular languages. The typical method for proving that a language is regular is to construct either a finite state machine or a regular expression for the language.\n\n\n"}

Led by the Akali Dal, it resulted in the formation of the Punjabi-majority Punjab state, the Haryanvi-Hindi-majority Haryana state and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Some Pahari majority parts of the East Punjab were also merged with Himachal Pradesh as a result of the movement.\n\nIn the 1950s, the linguistic groups across India sought statehood, which led to the establishment of the States Reorganisation Commission in dec 1953. At that time, the East Punjab state of India included present-day states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh (some parts) along with Chandigarh. East Punjab had a majority of Hindu religion followed by the Sikhs. \n\nThe Akali Dal, a Sikh-dominated political party active mainly in Punjab, sought to create a Punjabi Suba (\"Punjabi Province\"). The Sikh leaders such Fateh Singh tactically stressed the linguistic basis of the demand, while downplaying its religious basis — a state where the distinct Sikh identity could be preserved. \n\nThe Government of India was wary of carving out a separate Punjabi language state, because it effectively meant dividing the state along religious lines: Sikhs would form a 60% majority in the resulting Punjabi state. The case for creating a Punjabi Suba was presented to the States Reorganisation Commission. The States Reorganisation Commission, not recognising Punjabi as a language that was grammatically very distinct from Hindi, rejected the demand for a Punjabi-majority state. Another reason that the Commission gave in its report was that the movement lacked general support of the people inhabiting the region.\n\nHindi language movement of Punjab in the Hindi-speaking areas of Punjab started on 30 April 1957 and lasted till 27 December 1957, which paved the way for the demand for the formation of Haryana as a separate state for the Hindi speaking people of the united Punjab province. At the same time Punjab also had Punjabi suba & Punjabi language movement. Punjabi and gurmukhi were made official state language and script respectively, which was also made mandatory in schools of the whole of post-independence united Punjab. People of Hindi speaking areas of Punjab resisted this imposition in masses. Punjab government retaliated by mass arrests and imprisonments, some of arrested activists were tortured in the prison. Sumer Singh of Naya Bans in Rohtak district gave his life for this cause during this movement.\n\nAccording to the States Reorganisation Act, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) was merged with Punjab. However, the state still did not have a clear Punjabi majority, as it contained a large Hindi-speaking area.\n\nThe Akali Dal leaders continued their agitation for the creation of a \"Punjabi Suba\" after the merger of PEPSU to Punjab. Akali leader Sant Fateh Singh spearheaded the Punjabi Suba Morcha in 1966.\n\nIn September 1966, the Indira Gandhi-led Union Government accepted the demand. On September 7, 1966 Punjab Reorganisation Act was passed in Parliament. The Act was implemented with effect from November 1, 1966. Punjab was trifurcated creating Punjab, Haryana and transferring certain areas to Himachal Pradesh.\n\nAreas in the south of Punjab that spoke the Haryanvi dialect of Hindi formed the new state of Haryana, while the areas that spoke the Pahari dialects were merged to Himachal Pradesh (a Union Territory at the time). The remaining areas, except Chandigarh, formed the new Punjabi-majority state, which retained the name of Punjab. Until 1966, Punjab was a Hindu majority state (63.7%). But during the linguistic partition, the Hindu-majority districts were removed from the state. Chandigarh, the planned city built to replace Lahore, the capital of erstwhile Punjab, which became part of Pakistan during the partition. Chandigarh was claimed by both Haryana and Punjab. Pending resolution of the dispute, it was declared as a separate Union Territory which would serve as the capital of both the states.\n\nThe Akali Dal never accepted the Punjab in its existing form as of today. Akali Dal Opposed the implementation of the Punjab Reorganisation Act on 1 November 1966 and Akali leaders protested against it.\n\nA week after the implementation of the Act, Akali leader Fateh Singh initiated preparations for another long-drawn agitation to have Chandigarh and the Punjabi-speaking areas left in Haryana transferred to Punjab. He also sought seeking the control of Bhakra Dam and other hydro power projects and headworks. On November 16, 1966, the morcha was re-launched. Fateh started sending Jathas of Akali leaders to the countryside to mobilise support. December 12 was observed as Black Day. In the third week of December, Fateh started fast unto death at the Akal Takht. He then announced that he would immolate himself on December 27, 1966. The Union government was concerned at this announcement and continued negotiations on the demands. An hour before the scheduled time of 4 pm on December 27 for immolation, Fateh called off his immolation bid.\n\nThe prominent leaders of the movement included:\n"}

{"id": "28436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28436", "title": "Saint", "text": "Saint\n\nA saint is a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness or closeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \"in Christ\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Oriental Orthodox, and Lutheran doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nWhile the English word \"saint\" originated in Christianity, historians of religion now use the appellation \"in a more general way to refer to the state of special holiness that many religions attribute to certain people\", with the Jewish tzadik, the Islamic walī, the Hindu rishi or Sikh guru, and the Buddhist arhat or bodhisattva also being referred to as saints. Depending on the religion, saints are recognized either by official ecclesiastical declaration, as in the Catholic faith, or by popular acclamation (see Folk saint).\n\nThe English word \"\"saint\" comes from the Latin \"sanctus\". The word translated in Greek is \"ἅγιος\" (\"hagios\"), which means \"holy\". The word ἅγιος appears 229 times in the Greek New Testament, and its English translation 60 times in the corresponding text of the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nIn the New Testament, \"saint\" did not denote the deceased who had been recognized as especially holy or emulable, but rather the living faithful who had dedicated themselves to God.\n\nThe word \"sanctus\" was originally a technical one in ancient Roman religion, but due to its \"globalized\" use in Christianity the modern word \"saint\" in English and its equivalent in Romance languages is now also used as a translation of comparable terms for persons \"worthy of veneration for their holiness or sanctity\" in other religions.\n\nMany religions also use similar concepts (but different terminology) to venerate persons worthy of some honor. Author John A. Coleman (Society of Jesus, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California) wrote that saints across various cultures and religions have the following family resemblances:\n\n\nThe anthropologist Lawrence Babb in an article about Sathya Sai Baba asks the question \"Who is a saint?\", and responds by saying that in the symbolic infrastructure of some religions, there is the image of a certain extraordinary spiritual king's \"miraculous powers\", to whom frequently a certain moral presence is attributed. These saintly figures, he asserts, are \"the focal points of spiritual force-fields\". They exert \"powerful attractive influence on followers but touch the inner lives of others in transforming ways as well\".\n\nAccording to the Catholic Church, a \"saint\" is anyone in Heaven, whether recognized on Earth or not, who form the \"great cloud of witnesses\" (Hebrews 12:1). These \"may include our own mothers, grandmothers or other loved ones (cf. 2 Tim 1:5)\" who may have not always lived perfect lives but \"amid their faults and failings they kept moving forward and proved pleasing to the Lord\". The title \"Saint\" denotes a person who has been formally canonized, that is, officially and authoritatively declared a saint, by the Church as holder of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and is therefore believed to be in Heaven by the grace of God. There are many persons that the Church believes to be in Heaven who have not been formally canonized and who are otherwise titled \"saints\" because of the fame of their holiness. Sometimes the word \"saint\" also denotes living Christians.\n\nIn his book \"Saint of the Day\", editor Leonard Foley, OFM says this: the \"[Saints'] surrender to God's love was so generous an approach to the total surrender of Jesus that the Church recognizes them as heroes and heroines worthy to be held up for our inspiration. They remind us that the Church is holy, can never stop being holy and is called to show the holiness of God by living the life of Christ.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that it does not \"make\" or \"create\" saints, but rather recognizes them. Proofs of heroicity required in the process of beatification will serve to illustrate in detail the general principles exposed above upon proof of their \"holiness\" or likeness to God.\n\nOn 3 January 993, Pope John XV became the first pope to proclaim a person a \"saint\" from outside the diocese of Rome: on the petition of the German ruler, he had canonized Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg. Before that time, the popular \"cults\", or venerations, of saints had been local and spontaneous and were confirmed by the local bishop. Pope John XVIII subsequently permitted a cult of five Polish martyrs. Pope Benedict VIII later declared the Armenian hermit Symeon to be a saint, but it was not until the pontificate of Pope Innocent III that the Popes reserved to themselves the exclusive authority to canonize saints, so that local bishops needed the confirmation of the Pope. Walter of Pontoise was the last person in Western Europe to be canonized by an authority other than the Pope: Hugh de Boves, the Archbishop of Rouen, canonized him in 1153. Thenceforth a decree of Pope Alexander III in 1170 reserved the prerogative of canonization to the Pope, in so far as the Latin Church was concerned.\n\nOne source claims that \"there are over 10,000 named saints and beatified people from history, the Roman Martyrology and Orthodox sources, but no definitive head count\".\n\nAlban Butler published \"Lives of the Saints\" in 1756, including a total of 1,486 saints. The latest revision of this book, edited by the Jesuit Herbert Thurston and the British author Donald Attwater, contains the lives of 2,565 saints. Monsignor Robert Sarno, an official of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints of the Holy See, expressed that it is impossible to give an exact number of saints.\n\nThe veneration of saints, in Latin \"cultus\", or the \"cult of the Saints\", describes a particular popular devotion or entrustment of one's self to a particular saint or group of saints. Although the term \"worship\" is sometimes used, it is only used with the older English connotation of honoring or respecting (\"dulia\") a person. According to the Church, Divine worship is in the strict sense reserved only to God (\"latria\") and never to the Saints. One is permitted to ask the Saints to intercede or pray to God for persons still on Earth, just as one can ask someone on Earth to pray for him.\n\nA saint may be designated as a patron saint of a particular cause, profession, or locale, or invoked as a protector against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official declarations of the Church. Saints are not believed to have power of their own, but only that granted by God. Relics of saints are respected, or \"venerated\", similar to the veneration of holy images and icons. The practice in past centuries of venerating relics of saints with the intention of obtaining healing from God through their intercession is taken from the early Church. For example, an American deacon claimed in 2000 that Bl. John Henry Cardinal Newman interceded with God to cure him of a physical illness. The deacon, Jack Sullivan, asserted that after addressing Newman he was cured of spinal stenosis in a matter of hours. In 2009, a panel of theologians concluded that Sullivan's recovery was the result of his prayer to Newman. According to the Church, to be deemed a miracle, \"a medical recovery must be instantaneous, not attributable to treatment, disappear for good.\"\n\nOnce a person has been canonized, the deceased body of the saint is considered holy as a relic. The remains of saints are called holy relics and are usually used in churches. Saints' personal belongings may also be used as relics. Some of the saints have a special symbol by tradition, e.g., Saint Lawrence, deacon and martyr, is identified by a gridiron because he is believed to have been burned to death on one. This symbol is found, for instance, in the Canadian heraldry of the office responsible for the St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nFormal canonization is a lengthy process, often of many years or even centuries. The first stage in this process is an investigation of the candidate's life by an expert. After this, the official report on the candidate is submitted to the bishop of the pertinent diocese and more study is undertaken. The information is then sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints of the Holy See for evaluation at the universal level of the Church. If the application is approved the candidate may be granted the title \"Venerable\". Further investigation may lead to the candidate's beatification with the title \"Blessed\", which is elevation to the class of the \"Beati\". Next, and at a minimum, proof of two important miracles obtained from God through the intercession of the candidate are required for formal canonization as a saint. These miracles must be posthumous. Finally, after all of these procedures are complete, the Pope may canonize the candidate as a saint for veneration by the universal Church.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church a saint is defined as anyone who is in Heaven, whether recognized here on earth, or not. By this definition, Adam and Eve, Moses, the various prophets, except for the angels and archangels are all given the title of \"Saint\". Sainthood in the Orthodox Church does not necessarily reflect a moral model, but the communion with God: there are countless examples of people who lived in great sin and became saints by humility and repentance, such as Mary of Egypt, Moses the Ethiopian, and of course Dysmas, the repentant thief who was crucified. Therefore, a more complete definition of what a saint is, has to do with the way that saints, through their humility and their love of humankind, saved inside them the entire Church, and loved all people.\n\nOrthodox belief considers that god himself reveals his saints through answered prayers and other miracles. Saints are usually recognized by a local community, often by people who directly knew them. As their popularity grows they are often then recognized by the entire church. The formal process of recognition involves deliberation by a synod of bishops. If successful, this is followed by a service of Glorification in which the Saint is given a day on the church calendar to be celebrated by the entire church. This does not, however, make the person a saint; the person already was a saint and the Church ultimately recognized it.\n\nIt is believed that one of the ways the holiness (sanctity) of a person is revealed, is through the condition of their relics (remains). In some Orthodox countries (such as Greece, but not in Russia) graves are often reused after 3 to 5 years because of limited space. Bones are washed and placed in an ossuary, often with the person's name written on the skull. Occasionally when a body is exhumed something miraculous is reported as having occurred; exhumed bones are claimed to have given off a fragrance, like flowers, or a body is reported as having remained free of decay, despite not having been embalmed (traditionally the Orthodox do not embalm the dead) and having been buried for some years in the earth.\n\nThe reason relics are considered sacred is because, for the Orthodox, the separation of body and soul is unnatural. Body and soul both comprise the person, and in the end, body and soul will be reunited; therefore, the body of a saint shares in the \"Holiness\" of the soul of the saint. As a general rule only clergy will touch relics in order to move them or carry them in procession, however, in veneration the faithful will kiss the relic to show love and respect toward the saint. The altar in an Orthodox church usually contains relics of saints, often of martyrs. Church interiors are covered with the Icons of saints.\n\nBecause the Church shows no true distinction between the living and the dead (the saints are considered to be alive in Heaven), saints are referred to as if they were still alive. Saints are venerated but not worshipped. They are believed to be able to intercede for salvation and help mankind either through direct communion with God, or by personal intervention.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the title Ὅσιος, \"Hosios\" (f. Ὁσία \"Hosia\") is also used. This is a title attributed to saints who had lived a monastic or eremitic life, and it is equal to the more usual title of \"Saint\".\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox churches ‒ the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Tewahedo Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church ‒ follow a canonization process unique to each church. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, for example, has the requirement that at least 50 years must pass following a prospective saint's death before the Coptic Orthodox Church's pope can canonize the saint.\n\nIn the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a pious and holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be imitated, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey (). The saints are seen as elder brothers and sisters in Christ. Official Anglican creeds recognise the existence of the saints in heaven.\n\nIn high-church contexts, such as Anglo-Catholicism, a saint is generally one to whom has been attributed (and who has generally demonstrated) a high level of holiness and sanctity. In this use, a saint is therefore not merely a believer, but one who has been transformed by virtue. In Catholicism, a saint is a special sign of God's activity. The veneration of saints is sometimes misunderstood to be worship, in which case it is derisively termed \"hagiolatry\".\n\nSo far as invocation of the saints is concerned, one of the Church of England's Articles of Religion \"Of Purgatory\" condemns \"the Romish Doctrine concerning...(the) Invocation of Saints\" as \"a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God\". Anglo-Catholics in Anglican provinces using the Articles often make a distinction between a \"Romish\" and a \"Patristic\" doctrine concerning the invocation of saints, permitting the latter in accordance with Article XXII. Indeed, the theologian E.J. Bicknell, stated that the Anglican view acknowledges that the term \"invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), 'ora pro nobis,' or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed.\"\n\nSome Anglicans and Anglican churches, particularly Anglo-Catholics, personally ask prayers of the saints. However, such a practice is seldom found in any official Anglican liturgy. Unusual examples of it are found in The Korean Liturgy 1938, the liturgy of the Diocese of Guiana 1959 and The Melanesian English Prayer Book.\n\nAnglicans believe that the only effective Mediator between the believer and God the Father, in terms of redemption and salvation, is God the Son, Jesus Christ. Historical Anglicanism has drawn a distinction between the intercession of the saints and the invocation of the saints. The former was generally accepted in Anglican doctrine, while the latter was generally rejected.\" There are some, however, in Anglicanism, who do beseech the saints' intercession. Those who beseech the saints to intercede on their behalf make a distinction between \"mediator\" and \"intercessor\", and claim that asking for the prayers of the saints is no different in kind than asking for the prayers of living Christians. Anglican Catholics understand sainthood in a more Catholic or Orthodox way, often praying for intercessions from the saints and celebrating their feast days.\n\nAccording to the Church of England, a saint is one who is sanctified, as it translates in the Authorised King James Version (1611) 2 Chronicles 6:41 \nNow therefore arise, O God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.\nIn the Lutheran Church, all Christians, whether in heaven or on earth, are regarded as saints. However, the church still recognizes and honors specific saints, including some of those recognized by the Catholic Church, but in a qualified way: according to the Augsburg Confession, the term \"saint\" is used in the manner of the Catholic Church only insofar as to denote a person who received exceptional grace, was sustained by faith, and whose good works are to be an example to any Christian. Traditional Lutheran belief accounts that prayers \"to\" the saints are prohibited, as they are not mediators of redemption. But, Lutherans do believe that saints pray for the Christian Church in general. Philip Melanchthon, the author of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, approved honoring the saints by saying they are honored in three ways:\n\nThe Lutheran Churches also have liturgical calendars in which they honor individuals as saints.\n\nWhile Methodists as a whole do not practice the patronage or veneration of saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are \"saints\", but mainly use the term to refer to biblical people, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints, such as the Twelve Apostles, John Wesley, etc. Although, most are named after geographical locations associated with an early circuit or prominent location. Some Methodist congregations observe All Saints Day if they follow the liturgical calendar. Many encourage the study of saints, that is, the biography of holy people.\n\nThe 14th Article of Religion in the United Methodist Discipline states,\nThe Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God.\n\nJohn Wesley, the theological father of world Methodism, did not practice or permit Catholic practices associated with the veneration of the Virgin Mary or prayers to saints.\n\nIn many Protestant churches, the word \"saint\" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar in usage to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this sense, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (i.e., a professing Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider intercessory prayers to the saints to be idolatry as an application of divine worship that should be given only to God himself is being given to other believers, dead or alive. Many Protestant sects also consider the practice to be similar to necromancy as the dead are believed to be awaiting resurrection, unable to do anything for the living saint. \n\nWithin some Protestant traditions, \"saint\" is also used to refer to any born-again Christian. Many emphasize the traditional New Testament meaning of the word, preferring to write \"saint\" to refer to any believer, in continuity with the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.\n\nThe beliefs within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with regard to saints are similar but not quite the same as the Protestant tradition. In the New Testament, saints are all those who have entered into the Christian covenant of baptism. The qualification \"latter-day\" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the \"latter days\", before the Second Coming of Christ, and is used to distinguish the members of the LDS Church, which considers itself the restoration of the ancient Christian church. Members are therefore often referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\" or \"LDS\", and among themselves as \"saints\".\n\nThe use of the term \"saint\" is not exclusive to Christianity. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized within their tradition as having fulfilled the highest aspirations of religious teaching. In English, the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many world religions. The Jewish \"hasid\" or \"tsaddiq\", the Islamic \"Mu'min\", the Zoroastrian \"fravashi\", the Hindu \"rsi\" or \"guru,\" the Buddhist \"arahant\" or \"bodhisattva,\" the Daoist \"shengren,\" the Shinto \"kami\" and others have all been referred to as saints.\"\n\nCuban Santería, Haitian Vodou, Trinidad Orisha-Shango, Brazilian Umbanda, Candomblé, and other similar syncretist religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the deities. The name \"santería\" was originally a pejorative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms.\n\nBuddhists in both the Theravada and Mahayana traditions hold the \"Arhats\" in special esteem, as well as Bodhisattvas, other Buddhas, or eminent members of the \"Sangha\". Tibetan Buddhists hold the \"tulkus\" (reincarnates of deceased eminent practitioners) as living saints on earth.\n\nHindu saints are those recognized by Hindus as showing a great degree of holiness and sanctity. Hinduism has a long tradition of stories and poetry about saints. There is no formal canonization process in Hinduism, but over time, many men and women have reached the status of saints among their followers and among Hindus in general (unlike in Christianity, Hinduism does not canonize people as saints after death, but they can be accepted as saints during their lifetime). Hindu saints have often renounced the world, and are variously called gurus, sadhus, rishis, devarishis, rajarshis, saptarishis, brahmarshis, swamis, pundits, purohits, pujaris, acharyas, pravaras, yogis, yoginis, and other names.\n\nSome Hindu saints are given god-like status, being seen as incarnations of Vishnu, Shiva, Devi and other aspects of the Divine—this can happen during their lifetimes, or sometimes many years after their deaths. This explains another common name for Hindu saints: godmen.\n\nIslam has had a rich history of veneration of saints (often called \"wali\", which literally means \"Friend [of God]\"), which has declined in some parts of the Islamic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of Salafism. In Sunni Islam, the veneration of saints became a very common form of devotion early on, and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of \"special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.\" The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both \"loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him.\" \"Belief in the miracles of saints (\"karāmāt al-awliyāʾ\") ... [became a] requirement in Sunni Islam [during the classical period],\" with even medieval critics of the ubiquitous practice of grave visitation like Ibn Taymiyyah emphatically declaring: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The Quran has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators.\" The vast majority of saints venerated in the classical Sunni world were the Sufis, who were all Sunni mystics who belonged to one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law.\n\nVeneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread Sunni practices for more than a millennium, before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the Salafi movement, whose various streams regard it as \"being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.\" In a manner similar to the Protestant Reformation, the specific traditional practices which Salafism has tried to curtail in both Sunni and Shia contexts include those of the veneration of saints, visiting their graves, seeking their intercession, and honoring their relics. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: \"[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints…. [due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.\"\n\nThe term \"Tzadik\" (\"righteous\"), and its associated meanings, developed in rabbinic thought from its Talmudic contrast with \"Hasid\" (\"pious\"), to its exploration in ethical literature, and its esoteric spiritualisation in Kabbalah. In Hasidic Judaism, the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance, combining former elite mysticism with social movement for the first time.\n\nThe concept of \"sant\" or \"bhagat\" is found in North Indian religious thought including Sikhism, most notably in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, and others are known as \"Sants\" or \"Bhagats\". The term \"Sant\" is applied in the Sikh and related communities to beings that have attained enlightenment through God realization and spiritual union with God via repeatedly reciting the name of God (Naam Japo). Countless names of God exist, in Sikhism, \"Naam\" (spiritual internalization of God's name) is commonly attained through the name of Waheguru, which translates to \"Wondrous Guru\". \n\nSikhs are encouraged to follow the congregation of a Sant (Sadh Sangat) or \"The Company of the Holy\". \"Sants\" grace the Sadh Sangat with knowledge of the Divine God, and how to take greater steps towards obtaining spiritual enlightenment through \"Naam\". \"Sants\" are to be distinguished from \"Guru\" (such as Guru Nanak) who have compiled the path to God enlightenment in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Gurus are the physical incarnation of God upon Earth. Sikhism states however, that any beings that have become one with God are considered synonymous with God. As such, the fully realized Sant, Guru, and God are considered one. \n\n\n\n"}

Clinch fighting is stand-up grappling. Fighters employ striking, including striking combinations, using either body parts or mêlée weapons, to incapacitate or injure the opponent. Combatants use blocking techniques to block the opponent's attacks. \n\nMartial arts and combat sports that emphasize stand-up fighting include boxing (including bare-knuckle boxing), jōdō, karate, kendo, kickboxing, kung fu (sanda/sanshou), Muay Thai, savate, silat, and Taekwondo.\n\nThe nature of the stand-up fighting depends on whether the combatants are unarmed or use mêlée weapons. Batons become less effective at short, especially clinching range, where they cannot be swung properly. Knives on the other hand do not need as much thrusting space to generate damage. In stand-up fighting without mêlée weapons, it is possible to separate the distances between the combatants according to which strikes can reach the opponent.\nComfort zone: The comfort zone is a non-combat distance from which it is not possible to kick the opponent without closing the distance considerably. From this zone the combatant might carefully close in on the opponent to engage with strikes.\nKicking distance: The kicking distance is the most distant unarmed fighting position in which consistent contact can be made with the opponent. The combatants can use far-reaching quick kicks to the legs, body or head of the opponent. Martial arts such as Taekwondo, emphasize the kicking distance in fighting.\nPunching distance: The punching distance refers to the zone where punches can be thrown, and this is the distance from the furthest jab to the closest hook, as long as no grappling is taking place. In addition to punches, this distance often also allows for elbows and knees. Boxing is a combat sport that concerns itself exclusively with the punching distance. However many martial arts, particularly those that employ extreme close range fighting (for example Wing Chun and Southern Praying Mantis) train ranges within punch range, but do not necessarily employ clinching techniques. This collection of ranges is often called the in-fighting range.\nClinching zone: The clinching or trapping zone refers to the same distance as the punching distance, except that one or both combatants grapple, and at the same time prevent the other from moving into a more distant contact zone or into the comfort zone by using a clinch hold. This zone involves a multitude of both striking and grappling techniques, and is discussed in its own article clinch fighting.\n\n\n"}

A string is generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. \"String\" may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.\n\nDepending on programming language and precise data type used, a variable declared to be a string may either cause storage in memory to be statically allocated for a predetermined maximum length or employ dynamic allocation to allow it to hold a variable number of elements.\n\nWhen a string appears literally in source code, it is known as a string literal or an anonymous string.\n\nIn formal languages, which are used in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, a string is a finite sequence of symbols that are chosen from a set called an alphabet.\n\nLet Σ be a non-empty finite set of symbols (alternatively called characters), called the alphabet. No assumption is made about the nature of the symbols. A string (or word) over Σ is any finite sequence of symbols from Σ. For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then \"01011\" is a string over Σ.\n\nThe \"length\" of a string \"s\" is the number of symbols in \"s\" (the length of the sequence) and can be any non-negative integer; it is often denoted as |\"s\"|. The \"empty string\" is the unique string over Σ of length 0, and is denoted \"ε\" or \"λ\".\n\nThe set of all strings over Σ of length \"n\" is denoted Σ. For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then Σ = {00, 01, 10, 11}. Note that Σ = {ε} for any alphabet Σ.\n\nThe set of all strings over Σ of any length is the Kleene closure of Σ and is denoted Σ. In terms of Σ,\nFor example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then Σ = {ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, 011, ...}. Although the set Σ itself is countably infinite, each element of Σ is a string of finite length.\n\nA set of strings over Σ (i.e. any subset of Σ) is called a \"formal language\" over Σ. For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, the set of strings with an even number of zeros, {ε, 1, 00, 11, 001, 010, 100, 111, 0000, 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100, 1111, ...}, is a formal language over Σ.\n\n\"Concatenation\" is an important binary operation on Σ. For any two strings \"s\" and \"t\" in Σ, their concatenation is defined as the sequence of symbols in \"s\" followed by the sequence of characters in \"t\", and is denoted \"st\". For example, if Σ = {a, b, ..., z}, \"s\" = bear, and \"t\" = hug, then \"st\" = bearhug and \"ts\" = hugbear.\n\nString concatenation is an associative, but non-commutative operation. The empty string ε serves as the identity element; for any string \"s\", ε\"s\" = \"s\"ε = \"s\". Therefore, the set Σ and the concatenation operation form a monoid, the free monoid generated by Σ. In addition, the length function defines a monoid homomorphism from Σ to the non-negative integers (that is, a function formula_2, such that formula_3).\n\nA string \"s\" is said to be a \"substring\" or \"factor\" of \"t\" if there exist (possibly empty) strings \"u\" and \"v\" such that \"t\" = \"usv\". The relation \"is a substring of\" defines a partial order on Σ, the least element of which is the empty string.\n\nA string \"s\" is said to be a prefix of \"t\" if there exists a string \"u\" such that \"t\" = \"su\". If \"u\" is nonempty, \"s\" is said to be a \"proper\" prefix of \"t\". Symmetrically, a string \"s\" is said to be a suffix of \"t\" if there exists a string \"u\" such that \"t\" = \"us\". If \"u\" is nonempty, \"s\" is said to be a \"proper\" suffix of \"t\". Suffixes and prefixes are substrings of \"t\". Both the relations \"is a prefix of\" and \"is a suffix of\" are prefix orders.\n\nA string \"s\" = \"uv\" is said to be a rotation of \"t\" if \"t\" = \"vu\". For example, if Σ = {0, 1} the string 0011001 is a rotation of 0100110, where u = 00110 and v = 01.\n\nThe reverse of a string is a string with the same symbols but in reverse order. For example, if \"s\" = abc (where a, b, and c are symbols of the alphabet), then the reverse of \"s\" is cba. A string that is the reverse of itself (e.g., \"s\" = madam) is called a palindrome, which also includes the empty string and all strings of length 1.\n\nIt is often useful to define an ordering on a set of strings. If the alphabet Σ has a total order (cf. alphabetical order) one can define a total order on Σ called lexicographical order. For example, if Σ = {0, 1} and 0 < 1, then the lexicographical order on Σ includes the relationships ε < 0 < 00 < 000 < ... < 0001 < 001 < 01 < 010 < 011 < 0110 < 01111 < 1 < 10 < 100 < 101 < 111 < 1111 < 11111 ... The lexicographical order is total if the alphabetical order is, but isn't well-founded for any nontrivial alphabet, even if the alphabetical order is.\n\nSee Shortlex for an alternative string ordering that preserves well-foundedness.\n\nA number of additional operations on strings commonly occur in the formal theory. These are given in the article on string operations.\n\nStrings admit the following interpretation as nodes on a graph:\n\nThe natural topology on the set of fixed-length strings or variable-length strings is the discrete topology, but the natural topology on the set of infinite strings is the limit topology, viewing the set of infinite strings as the inverse limit of the sets of finite strings. This is the construction used for the \"p\"-adic numbers and some constructions of the Cantor set, and yields the same topology.\n\nIsomorphisms between string representations of topologies can be found by normalizing according to the lexicographically minimal string rotation.\n\nA string datatype is a datatype modeled on the idea of a formal string. Strings are such an important and useful datatype that they are implemented in nearly every programming language. In some languages they are available as primitive types and in others as composite types. The syntax of most high-level programming languages allows for a string, usually quoted in some way, to represent an instance of a string datatype; such a meta-string is called a \"literal\" or \"string literal\".\n\nAlthough formal strings can have an arbitrary but finite length, the length of strings in real languages is often constrained to an artificial maximum. In general, there are two types of string datatypes: \"fixed-length strings\", which have a fixed maximum length to be determined at compile time and which use the same amount of memory whether this maximum is needed or not, and \"variable-length strings\", whose length is not arbitrarily fixed and which can use varying amounts of memory depending on the actual requirements at run time. Most strings in modern programming languages are variable-length strings. Of course, even variable-length strings are limited in length – by the number of bits available to a pointer, and by the size of available computer memory. The string length can be stored as a separate integer (which may put an artificial limit on the length) or implicitly through a termination character, usually a character value with all bits zero such as in C programming language. See also \"Null-terminated\" below.\n\nString datatypes have historically allocated one byte per character, and, although the exact character set varied by region, character encodings were similar enough that programmers could often get away with ignoring this, since characters a program treated specially (such as period and space and comma) were in the same place in all the encodings a program would encounter. These character sets were typically based on ASCII or EBCDIC. If text in one encoding was displayed on a system using a different encoding, text was often mangled, though often somewhat readable and some computer users learned to read the mangled text.\n\nLogographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (known collectively as CJK) need far more than 256 characters (the limit of a one 8-bit byte per-character encoding) for reasonable representation. The normal solutions involved keeping single-byte representations for ASCII and using two-byte representations for CJK ideographs. Use of these with existing code led to problems with matching and cutting of strings, the severity of which depended on how the character encoding was designed. Some encodings such as the EUC family guarantee that a byte value in the ASCII range will represent only that ASCII character, making the encoding safe for systems that use those characters as field separators. Other encodings such as ISO-2022 and Shift-JIS do not make such guarantees, making matching on byte codes unsafe. These encodings also were not \"self-synchronizing\", so that locating character boundaries required backing up to the start of a string, and pasting two strings together could result in corruption of the second string.\n\nUnicode has simplified the picture somewhat. Most programming languages now have a datatype for Unicode strings. Unicode's preferred byte stream format UTF-8 is designed not to have the problems described above for older multibyte encodings. UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 require the programmer to know that the fixed-size code units are different than the \"characters\", the main difficulty currently is incorrectly designed APIs that attempt to hide this difference (UTF-32 does make \"code points\" fixed-sized, but these are not \"characters\" due to composing codes).\n\nSome languages like C++ implement strings as templates that can be used with any datatype, but this is the exception, not the rule.\n\nSome languages, such as C++ and Ruby, normally allow the contents of a string to be changed after it has been created; these are termed \"mutable\" strings. In other languages, such as Java and Python, the value is fixed and a new string must be created if any alteration is to be made; these are termed \"immutable\" strings.\n\nStrings are typically implemented as arrays of bytes, characters, or code units, in order to allow fast access to individual units or substrings—including characters when they have a fixed length. A few languages such as Haskell implement them as linked lists instead.\n\nSome languages, such as Prolog and Erlang, avoid implementing a dedicated string datatype at all, instead adopting the convention of representing strings as lists of character codes.\n\nRepresentations of strings depend heavily on the choice of character repertoire and the method of character encoding. Older string implementations were designed to work with repertoire and encoding defined by ASCII, or more recent extensions like the ISO 8859 series. Modern implementations often use the extensive repertoire defined by Unicode along with a variety of complex encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16.\n\nThe term \"byte string\" usually indicates a general-purpose string of bytes, rather than strings of only (readable) characters, strings of bits, or such. Byte strings often imply that bytes can take any value and any data can be stored as-is, meaning that there should be no value interpreted as a termination value.\n\nMost string implementations are very similar to variable-length arrays with the entries storing the character codes of corresponding characters. The principal difference is that, with certain encodings, a single logical character may take up more than one entry in the array. This happens for example with UTF-8, where single codes (UCS code points) can take anywhere from one to four bytes, and single characters can take an arbitrary number of codes. In these cases, the logical length of the string (number of characters) differs from the physical length of the array (number of bytes in use). UTF-32 avoids the first part of the problem.\n\nThe length of a string can be stored implicitly by using a special terminating character; often this is the null character (NUL), which has all bits zero, a convention used and perpetuated by the popular C programming language. Hence, this representation is commonly referred to as a C string. This representation of an \"n\"-character string takes \"n\" + 1 space (1 for the terminator), and is thus an implicit data structure.\n\nIn terminated strings, the terminating code is not an allowable character in any string. Strings with \"length\" field do not have this limitation and can also store arbitrary binary data.\n\nAn example of a \"null-terminated string\" stored in a 10-byte buffer, along with its ASCII (or more modern UTF-8) representation as 8-bit hexadecimal numbers is:\n\nThe length of the string in the above example, \"codice_1\", is 5 characters, but it occupies 6 bytes. Characters after the terminator do not form part of the representation; they may be either part of other data or just garbage. (Strings of this form are sometimes called \"ASCIZ strings\", after the original assembly language directive used to declare them.)\n\nUsing a special byte other than null for terminating strings has historically appeared in both hardware and software, though sometimes with a value that was also a printing character. codice_2 was used by many assembler systems, codice_3 used by CDC systems (this character had a value of zero), and the ZX80 used codice_4 since this was the string delimiter in its BASIC language.\n\nSomewhat similar, \"data processing\" machines like the IBM 1401 used a special word mark bit to delimit strings at the left, where the operation would start at the right. This bit had to be clear in all other parts of the string. This meant that, while the IBM 1401 had a seven-bit word, almost no-one ever thought to use this as a feature, and override the assignment of the seventh bit to (for example) handle ASCII codes.\n\nEarly microcomputer software relied upon the fact that ASCII codes do not use the high-order bit, and set it to indicate the end of a string. It must be reset to 0 prior to output.\n\nThe length of a string can also be stored explicitly, for example by prefixing the string with the length as a byte value. This convention is used in many Pascal dialects; as a consequence, some people call such a string a Pascal string or P-string. Storing the string length as byte limits the maximum string length to 255. To avoid such limitations, improved implementations of P-strings use 16-, 32-, or 64-bit words to store the string length. When the \"length\" field covers the address space, strings are limited only by the available memory.\n\nIf the length is bounded, then it can be encoded in constant space, typically a machine word, thus leading to an implicit data structure, taking \"n\" + \"k\" space, where \"k\" is the number of characters in a word (8 for 8-bit ASCII on a 64-bit machine, 1 for 32-bit UTF-32/UCS-4 on a 32-bit machine, etc.).\nIf the length is not bounded, encoding a length \"n\" takes log(\"n\") space (see fixed-length code), so length-prefixed strings are a succinct data structure, encoding a string of length \"n\" in log(\"n\") + \"n\" space.\n\nIn the latter case, the length-prefix field itself doesn't have fixed length, therefore the actual string data needs to be moved when the string grows such that the length field needs to be increased.\n\nHere is a Pascal string stored in a 10-byte buffer, along with its ASCII / UTF-8 representation:\n\nMany languages, including object-oriented ones, implement strings as records with an internal structure like:\n\nHowever, since the implementation is usually hidden, the string must be accessed and modified through member functions. codice_5 is a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory area, which might be expanded as needed. See also string (C++).\n\nBoth character termination and length codes limit strings: For example, C character arrays that contain null (NUL) characters cannot be handled directly by C string library functions: Strings using a length code are limited to the maximum value of the length code.\n\nBoth of these limitations can be overcome by clever programming.\n\nIt is possible to create data structures and functions that manipulate them that do not have the problems associated with character termination and can in principle overcome length code bounds. It is also possible to optimize the string represented using techniques from run length encoding (replacing repeated characters by the character value and a length) and Hamming encoding.\n\nWhile these representations are common, others are possible. Using ropes makes certain string operations, such as insertions, deletions, and concatenations more efficient.\n\nThe core data structure in a text editor is the one that manages the string (sequence of characters) that represents the current state of the file being edited.\nWhile that state could be stored in a single long consecutive array of characters, a typical text editor instead uses an alternative representation as its sequence data structure—a gap buffer, a linked list of lines, a piece table, or a rope—which makes certain string operations, such as insertions, deletions, and undoing previous edits, more efficient.\n\nThe differing memory layout and storage requirements of strings can affect the security of the program accessing the string data. String representations requiring a terminating character are commonly susceptible to buffer overflow problems if the terminating character is not present, caused by a coding error or an attacker deliberately altering the data. String representations adopting a separate length field are also susceptible if the length can be manipulated. In such cases, program code accessing the string data requires bounds checking to ensure that it does not inadvertently access or change data outside of the string memory limits.\n\nString data is frequently obtained from user-input to a program. As such, it is the responsibility of the program to validate the string to ensure that it represents the expected format. Performing limited or no validation of user-input can cause a program to be vulnerable to code injection attacks.\n\nSometimes, strings need to be embedded inside a text file that is both human-readable and intended for consumption by a machine. This is needed in, for example, source code of programming languages, or in configuration files. In this case, the NUL character doesn't work well as a terminator since it is normally invisible (non-printable) and is difficult to input via a keyboard. Storing the string length would also be inconvenient as manual computation and tracking of the length is tedious and error-prone.\n\nTwo common representations are:\n\nWhile character strings are very common uses of strings, a string in computer science may refer generically to any sequence of homogeneously typed data. A bit string or byte string, for example, may be used to represent non-textual binary data retrieved from a communications medium. This data may or may not be represented by a string-specific datatype, depending on the needs of the application, the desire of the programmer, and the capabilities of the programming language being used. If the programming language's string implementation is not 8-bit clean, data corruption may ensue.\n\nC programmers draw a sharp distinction between a \"string\", aka a \"string of characters\", which by definition is always null terminated, vs. a \"byte string\" or \"pseudo string\" which may be stored in the same array but is often not null terminated.\nUsing C string handling functions on such a \"byte string\" often seems to work, but later leads to security problems.\n\nThere are many algorithms for processing strings, each with various trade-offs. Some categories of algorithms include:\n\nAdvanced string algorithms often employ complex mechanisms and data structures, among them suffix trees and finite state machines.\n\nThe name \"stringology\" was coined in 1984 by computer scientist Zvi Galil for the issue of algorithms and data structures used for string processing.\n\nCharacter strings are such a useful datatype that several languages have been designed in order to make string processing applications easy to write. Examples include the following languages:\n\nMany Unix utilities perform simple string manipulations and can be used to easily program some powerful string processing algorithms. Files and finite streams may be viewed as strings.\n\nSome APIs like Multimedia Control Interface, embedded SQL or printf use strings to hold commands that will be interpreted.\n\nRecent scripting programming languages, including Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl employ regular expressions to facilitate text operations. Perl is particularly noted for its regular expression use, and many other languages and applications implement Perl compatible regular expressions.\n\nSome languages such as Perl and Ruby support string interpolation, which permits arbitrary expressions to be evaluated and included in string literals.\n\nString functions are used to manipulate a string or change or edit the contents of a string. They also are used to query information about a string. They are usually used within the context of a computer programming language.\n\nThe most basic example of a string function is the string length function – the function that returns the length of a string (not counting any terminator characters or any of the string's internal structural information) and does not modify the string. This function is often named codice_6 or codice_7. For example, codice_8 would return 11.\n\nIn some programming languages, a string buffer is an alternative to a string. It has the ability to be altered through adding or appending, whereas a String is normally fixed or immutable.\n\nJava's standard way to handle text is to use its codice_9 class. Any given codice_10 in Java is an immutable object, which means its state cannot be changed. A codice_10 has an array of characters. Whenever a codice_10 must be manipulated, any changes require the creation of a new codice_10 (which, in turn, involves the creation of a new array of characters, and copying of the original array). This happens even if the original codice_10's value or intermediate codice_10s used for the manipulation are not kept.\n\nJava provides two alternate classes for string manipulation, called and . Both of these, like codice_10, each has an array to hold characters. They, however, are mutable (its state can be altered). Their array of characters is not necessarily completely filled (as opposed to a String, whose array is always the exact required length for its contents). Thus, a codice_17 or codice_18 has the capability to add, remove, or change its state without creating a new object (and without the creation of a new array, and array copying). The exception to this is when its array is no longer of suitable length to hold its content (a case which rarely happens because of the default Dynamic memory allocation provided by the JVM). In this case, it is required to create a new array, and copy the contents.\n\nFor these reasons, Java would handle an expression like\n\nlike this:\nGenerally, a codice_17 is more efficient than a String in string handling. However, this is not necessarily the case, since a StringBuffer will be required to recreate its character array when it runs out of space. Theoretically, this is possible to happen the same number of times as a new String would be required, although this is unlikely (and the programmer can provide length hints to prevent this). Either way, the effect is not noticeable in modern desktop computers.\n\nAs well, the shortcomings of arrays are inherent in a codice_17. In order to insert or remove characters at arbitrary positions, whole sections of arrays must be moved.\n\nThe method by which a codice_17 is attractive in an environment with low processing power takes this ability by using too much memory, which is likely also at a premium in this environment. This point, however, is trivial, considering the space required for creating many instances of Strings in order to process them. As well, the StringBuffer can be optimized to \"waste\" as little memory as possible.\n\nThe class, introduced in J2SE 5.0, differs from codice_17 in that it is unsynchronized. When only a single thread at a time will access the object, using a codice_18 processes more efficiently than using a codice_17.\n\ncodice_17 and codice_18 are included in the package.\n\nMicrosoft's .NET Framework has a codice_18 class in its Base Class Library.\n\n\nSome microprocessor's instruction set architectures contain direct support for string operations, such as block copy (e.g. In intel x86m codice_30).\n\n"}

The Spanish-language version was released 18 months later.\n\nA new multimedia, and significantly updated, version of the English Talking Glossary of Genetics was released by the National Human Genome Research Institute in October, 2009. An identical update of the Spanish-language version was released in October, 2011. In September, 2011, an iPhone App of the English Talking Glossary was released by NHGRI and made available as a free download in the Apple App store. The App version contains all 3-D animations, high quality illustrations, the \"Test Your Gene IQ\" quiz, and similar user functions such as \"Suggest a Term\" and \"Mail This Term to a Friend.\"\n\nThe original version had been based on simple HTML entries and was developed in the mid-1990s at a time when dial-up modems were commonly used to access the internet at speeds as low as 14.4 kps. That version of the Talking Glossary contained 178 terms and talking explanations of each term, as well as about 70 black-and-white illustrations. \n\nThe new, and current, versions of the Talking Glossary featured a substantial visual, content, and functional upgrade to the popular online tool. The new Glossaries are built on a vibrant FLASH-based web design employing colorful pages, clear digital audio files, color illustrations, 3-D animations, a \"Test Your Gene IQ\" function, real-time applets to \"cite a term in a paper\", \"suggest a term\", and \"share a term\" via email.\n\nThe list of terms was expanded to 256 entries. Terms were chosen using a number of metrics including a review of the online usage of the glossary over the previous decade. Some terms were dropped as a result, and a large number of terms were added. Other metrics used to determine terms included a scan of the most commonly used science books in U.S. K-12 classrooms for terms and concepts, review of all terms suggested by users using the glossary term suggestion function, and a scan of public media and scientific publications for terms.\n\nDeveloping the Talking Glossary:\n\nThe Talking Glossary of Genetics is a science learning tool developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NHGRI oversaw the NIH's role in the Human Genome Project, the international research effort aimed at mapping the genes in the human body and developing tools for gene discovery.\n\nMany of the Talking Glossary terms are commonly used today in news reports, by researchers and medical professionals, in classrooms and, increasingly, as part of daily conversation.\n\nIn this light, the Glossary was designed to enable people without a formal scientific background to better understand the terms and concepts behind genetic research. Special attention has been paid to users who are learning or teaching genetics in the classroom. However, the Glossary is designed to be valuable for a much wider audience including patients, doctors, nurses, parents, and professionals dealing with genetic concepts and terminology, such as judges, lawyers, law enforcement officials, and others.\n\nThe process of developing the Talking Glossary began by examining some of the most popular American middle school and high school science textbooks. Genetics-related terms from these textbooks provided the foundation for the Talking Glossary. These terms are associated with biological concepts addressed by the National Science Education Standards and common in high school and college biology courses. Additional terms not found in textbooks were added to the glossary, reflecting the rapid pace of genetic research and its coverage in the media.\n\nWritten Definitions:\n\nEach glossary entry has a written definition that has been reviewed for clarity and accuracy by teams of science educators and genetic researchers. All of the definitions were written by the same Ph.D.-level science writer for consistency and accuracy.\n\nIllustrations:\n\nMost terms have professionally drawn illustrations to further explain a meaning or concept, or place them in context of the cell or a similar biological setting as a means to better explain the term. All illustrations are provided by the medical illustrator/artist at the NHGRI to enable continuity and maximize re-use in learning tools such as slide shows. All illustrations are copyright free.\n\nEach illustration can be viewed as a webpage within the glossary or downloaded as a high-quality PDF file or PowerPoint slide.\n\n3–D Animations:\n\nThe Glossary contains many terms that are illustrated with 3-D movie animations. The animations have a non-descript musical background and are purposely not narrated to maximize use. These animations may be played alone or simultaneously with the spoken definition of the term. All cellular organelles have animation sequences, as do many key terms such as gene, cell, ACGT, and chromosome.\n\nSpoken Explanations of Glossary Terms:\n\nEach term features a friendly and informative spoken explanation that can be heard on any computer with sound capabilities by clicking on the \"Listen\" button on each term page. Spoken explanations can be paused at any point for user convenience.\n\nEach speaker comments on, or defines, terms relevant to their personal field of study. For example, leading cancer researchers comment on cancer, genetic counselors explain genetic testing terms, and expert gene hunters tackle the many terms surrounding the search for or mapping of genes. All speakers are actively working in the field, and most work at NHGRI.\n\nThe written definition provides a reasonable definition for each term. The spoken definition is not the same as the written definition. Instead, each speaker was asked to provide information different than the written definition that would expand the listener’s understanding of the term. Speakers were also asked to explain the term to the average person, not another scientist. No speaker was allowed to read, all recorded explanations are spontaneous.\n\nHow to Pronounce a Term:\n\nMuch of the terminology of genetics and biology is unique in its pronunciation. Below each term name is a “Pronunciation” button. Click the button to hear the term spoken. Each term, regardless of its name, is pronounced.\n\nInformation On Each Speaker:\n\nA brief biography and photograph of each speaker accompanies terms listed in the glossary. This enables the user to examine the speaker's credentials and learn more about their research interests.\n\nRelated Terms:\n\nIf either a written or spoken definition uses other Talking Glossary terms in its text or dialogue, these terms appear in the “Related Terms” listing at the bottom of each term page. The related terms list also includes Glossary terms that reviewers of the Glossary felt would be helpful to the user.\n\n“Test Your Gene Knowledge” Quiz:\n\nThe Talking Glossary offers a 10-term quiz designed to be both fun and instructional. The quiz can be accessed from every term page in the Glossary. Users can choose to test their knowledge about terms commonly found in K-16 science classrooms or, more generally, in popular news reports or conversation. The quiz randomly chooses terms from the Talking Glossary and asks the user to select a term name to match the definition shown. Hints are available for each question, and at the end of the quiz all users are able to print a \"Certificate of Completion\" that includes the date the test was taken, number of correct answers, and the user's name.\n\nAbout PDF and PPT Files:\n\nPDF (Portable Document Format) files are high-quality image files that appear and print like the original artwork. These finely detailed illustrations will download quickly and include required fonts. PDF files of Glossary illustrations can be downloaded and saved for later uses, such as overhead transparencies, school reports, or for handouts in class or at a talk or other event. Each PDF file is formatted to print on regular printer paper or standard overhead transparency.\n\nIllustrations are also downloadable as PowerPoint slides. These files can be easily copied and pasted into any existing PowerPoint presentation or can serve as a starting point for a new presentation. These slides are designed to provide lecturers with an easy-to-use and convenient source of illustrations for genetic terms and concepts.\n\nTalking Glossary Project Team: \n\nProject Concept / Project Direction / Digital Audio Interviews:\n\nIllustrations / 3-D Animation:\n\nScientific Advisor:\n\nContextual Review Team:\n\n3-D Animation / Graphics / Design / Programming:\n\nResearchers / Professionals Providing Term Explanations:\nAlan E.

Her father Triratna Man Tuladhar was a Lhasa Newar trader. Her grandfather Dharma Man Tuladhar was a philanthropist best known for renovating the Swayambhui stupa in 1918.\n\nThere were only a few schools in the 1930s as the Rana regime did not want ordinary citizens to get an education. For girls, it was even more difficult to join school. So Tara Devi received informal tuition at home.\n\nIn 1948, her family sent her to study at St. Josephs's Convent in Kalimpong, India. Returning to Kathmandu, she joined Kanya High School and finished 10th grade. In 1953, she went to Allahabad, India and enrolled at Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital to pursue her long cherished goal to become a nurse. Two years later, she received her Diploma in Midwifery.\n\nShe had been inspired to become a nurse by the tales she had heard as a child about how nurse Vidyabati Kansakar had cared for the injured during the great earthquake of 1934 in Kathmandu.\n\nIn 1960, Tara Devi began service at Prasuti Griha Maternity Hospital, Kathmandu. After doing her Post Graduate in Nursing from the College of Nursing, New Delhi in 1964, she became a senior tutor at Nursing School in Kathmandu.\n\nIn 1961, she became the first female blood donor in Nepal by donating blood to a patient who was due for surgery and required blood urgently. She was the supervisor at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital before she retired in 1990.\n\nAfter her retirement, Tara Devi worked as a volunteer at Dharmakirti Vihar, a Theravada Buddhist nunnery in Kathmandu, and used her skills as a trained nurse in the service of the resident nuns and the needy people who came there seeking help. As the coordinator of its health service, she organized free health care every week besides providing training on the care of patients and the elderly. She was also a life member of the Dharmakirti Vihar Conservation Trust.\n\nTara Devi volunteered at Jana Chikitsalaya, a community clinic in Kathmandu. Besides serving as an executive board member of Paropakar Organisation, the first modern charitable organization in Nepal which was established in 1952, she was an adviser to Udaaya Samaj, a social organization of the Uray community. Tara Devi remained unmarried to be free to pursue her profession.\n\nTara Devi has authored two books, one in Nepali and the other in Nepal Bhasa.\n\n"}

These corpora are made available through the Sketch Engine corpus manager. There are TenTen corpora for more than 35 languages. Their target size is 10 billion (10) words per language, which gave rise to the corpus family's name.\n\nIn the creation of the TenTen corpora, data crawled from the World Wide Web are processed with natural language processing tools developed by the Natural Language Processing Centre at the Faculty of Informatics at Masaryk University (Brno, Czech Republic) and by the Lexical Computing company (developer of the Sketch Engine).\n\nIn corpus linguistics, a text corpus is a large and structured collection of texts that are electronically stored and processed. It is used to do hypothesis testing about languages, validating linguistic rules or the frequency distribution of words (n-grams) within languages. \n\nElectronically processed corpora provide fast search. Text processing procedures such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging and word-sense disambiguation enrich corpus texts with detailed linguistic information. This enables to narrow the search to a particular parts of speech, word sequences or a specific part of the corpus.\n\nFirst text corpora were created in the 1960s, such as the 1-million-word Brown Corpus of American English. Over time, many further corpora were produced (such as the British National Corpus and the LOB Corpus) and work had begun also on corpora of larger sizes and covering other languages than English. This development was linked with the emergence of corpus creation tools that help achieve larger size, wider coverage, cleaner data etc.\n\nThe procedure by which TenTen corpora are produced is based on the creators' earlier research in preparing web corpora and the subsequent processing thereof.\n\nAt the beginning, a huge amount of text data is downloaded from the World Wide Web by the dedicated SpiderLing web crawler. In a later stage, these texts undergo cleaning, which consists of removing any non-textual material such as navigation links, headers and footers from the HTML source code of web pages with the jusText tool, so that only full solid sentences are preserved. Eventually, the ONION tool is applied to remove duplicate text portions from the corpus, which naturally occur on the World Wide Web due to practices such as quoting, citing, copying etc.\n\nTenTen corpora follow a specific metadata structure that is common to all of them. Metadata is contained in structural attributes that relate to individual documents and paragraphs in the corpus. Some TenTen corpora can feature additional specific attributes.\n\n\n\nThe following corpora can be accessed through the Sketch Engine as of October 2018:\n\n"}

{"id": "17234925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17234925", "title": "Truce term", "text": "Truce term\n\nA truce term is a word or short phrase accepted within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are \"barley\", \"fainites\", \"crosses\", \"kings\" and \"exe(s)\"in the United Kingdom, \"pegs\" and \"nibs\" in New Zealand and variants of \"barley\" in Australia. In the United States, terms based on \"time-out\" have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on \"kings\" and \"exe(s)\". Since the late 1980s \"time-out\" has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on the rules of the game.\n\nTraditionally these terms are specific to certain geographical areas although some may be used by a particular social group such as \"pax\" in the UK, used primarily by children attending private schools. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together.\n\nThe most extensive study of the use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie in the UK in their 1959 book, \"The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren\", which mapped the use of truce terms across England, Wales and Scotland. The Opies considered it the most important word in a schoolchild's vocabulary and one for which there was no adult equivalent. There has been little recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms, including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s, are still in general use. Studies conducted since the 1970s in English speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States with a number of terms deriving from older terms used in the UK, but many not.\n\nThe use of a truce term is usually accompanied by a gesture, such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs. In the US a T-shape made with both hands (representing \"time-out\") has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries.\n\nTruce terms are recorded as having been used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a stitch, a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.\n\nThe vocabulary of children's games, including truce terms, is described by sociolinguist Peter Trudgill in \"Dialects of England\" as being particularly rich in regional variation insofar as they are not based on official or television culture. They are an example of the subculture of young children which is transmitted by word of mouth.\n\nThe Opies conducted a study of the use of truce terms throughout England, Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in a book called \"The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren\". They found truce terms varied according to geographical location, with the exception of \"pax\". In some places, more than one term was current and often four or five were known, although usually only one term predominated. Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both. The words used in urban areas were often at odds with words used in the surrounding countryside. The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations. The most widely used were \"barley\", \"fainites\", \"kings\", \"crosses\", \"keys\", \"skinch\", \"cree\" and \"scribs\".\n\n\"Barley\" was recorded by the Opies as the prevailing term in east Scotland and the Borders, the Lake District, north-west England, west Midlands and in Wales, apart from the south east of Wales where \"cree\" prevailed. There were many variations such as \"barley-bay\", \"barley-bees\", \"barlow\" or \"barrels\". The use of \"barlay\" as a truce term appears in the 14th century poem \"Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight\" and Tobias Smollett's \"The Reprisal\". It is recorded in lexicographer John Jamieson's 1808 \"Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language\" as a term specifically used by children to demand truce. A probable variation also appears in the 1568 manuscript \"Chrysts-Kirk of the Grene\", sometimes attributed to James I of Scotland, as follows;\n\nThe \"Thoume\" (thumb) that is \"sklyss\" (sliced) in the quote above may refer to the thumb having been raised by the man calling \"barlafummill\", a common accompanying gesture to the use of a truce term in Scotland.\n\n\"Fainites\" and \"fains\" (or \"vainites\" and \"vains\") predominated in London and throughout southern England, apart from the \"scribs\" and \"screams\" of east Hampshire, and extended north as far as Olney in Buckinghamshire. Variations included \"fennits\", \"fannies\", \"fainsies\", \"faylines\", \"vainlights\" and \"vainyards\". \"Notes and Queries\" reported in 1870 that \"fains\" was in common use by London schoolboys. \"Faints\" appeared in an 1889 dictionary of slang and \"fainits\" in 1891. According to philologist J. R. R. Tolkien, the term derives from the medieval term \"fein I\", descended in turn from the Old French \"se feindre\" meaning \"to make excuses, hang back or back out of battle\". He also proposes that this use of the term throws light on line 529 of the Clerk's Tale by Chaucer that \"lordes heestes mowe nat been \"yfeyned\"\" (the lords orders cannot be treated with a \"fain I\"; in other words, declined). Another translation of the Anglo-Norman word \"feindre\" is \"pretend, feign, turn a blind eye to\", which is what the more powerful child does whilst granting respite.\n\nSpoken English south of the Danelaw became, from at least the 11th century onwards, characterised by a pronunciation known as Southern Voicing, such as \"vrog\" for frog, or \"zummer\" for summer. \"Vainites\" or \"vains\", variants of \"fainites\" or \"fains\", are surviving examples of this on the borders of the Danelaw to the north of London. Other truce terms prevail within the Danelaw.\n\n\"Kings\" was recorded by the Opies as common in eastern England. \"The English Dialect Dictionary\" recorded much the same in the nineteenth century. The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg's 1851 \"Dialect of Northamptonshire\". \"Queens\" is recorded as used in the \"kings\" area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart the game. \"Kings truce\" is found in Thomas Dekker's \"The Honest Whore, Part One (II,i)\", which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel.\n\n\"Crosses\", \"cruces\", \"creases\" and \"cree\" were found in a broad band across England from \"crosses\" in Lincolnshire, \"cruce\" or \"cruces\" from Oxford through to Gloucester, \"creases\" in Berkshire and \"cree\" in South Wales and both sides of the Bristol Channel. There are some areas of \"scruces\", \"screwsies\" or \"screws\" in Essex and Suffolk. The Opies saw \"creases\" as a transitional word.\n\n\"Exes\", used around Ipswich and Norwich, was thought to be a variant of \"crosses\".\n\n\"Bars\" and sometimes \"barsies\" were common in Devon in an otherwise predominantly \"fainites\" area. \"Bar\" was used the other side of the Bristol channel in Swansea.\n\n\"Skinch\" or \"skinge\" predominated in Northumberland and Durham, another term first recorded in a nineteenth-century dialect dictionary.\n\n\"Keys\" was found by the Opies to be the prevailing term in western Scotland and in a strip running through north-west England in an otherwise predominantly \"barley\" area.\n\n\"Scribs\" or \"squibs\" coverered an area from Hampshire, to West Sussex and Surrey. Other Hampshire variants were \"scrims\", \"screens\", \"scrames\", \"screams\", \"creams\" and \"cribs\".\n\n\"Finns\" was used in Guernsey.\n\n\"Pax\", (Latin for \"peace\"), was a group dialect word rather than a regional one as it was predominantly used in private schools and school stories.\n\nMany individual cities, towns and rural districts had their own words, not used elsewhere such as \"bees\", \"blobs\", \"croggies\", \"denny\", \"keppies\", \"locks\", \"peas\", \"peril\", \"nix\", \"truce\", \"snakes\" and \"twigs\".\n\nA study undertaken in Lincolnshire in 1974 confirmed the Opies' findings. However, a later study undertaken in Croydon, Surrey in 1988 found the use of truce terms much less uniform. Croydon is firmly in the \"fainites\" area on the Opies' map, but in 1988 \"fainites\" was only the third most commonly used term. The most common terms were \"pax\" (30%), \"jecs\" (25%), \"fainites\" (20%) and \"cross keys\" (2%). \"Jecs\" is a term not recorded by the Opies at all and there was some evidence that it derived from the word \"injection\". \"Fainites\" was known more than it was used and was reported by one teacher to be \"totally lacking in street credibility\". \"Pax\" was no longer a group word as reported by the Opies. Other terms reported included \"pips\", \"force field\" and \"quits\". The authors concluded that either the Opies had grossly oversimplified the picture or things had radically changed in 30 years (some seven to eight generations of primary school children). They also noted that although some schools reported a marked preference for a particular term, all schools reported at least some children using different terms.\n\nThe Concise Scots Language Dictionary published in 1999, records the use of \"keys\" as a truce term in Fife, south west and west central Scotland.\n\nAccording to researchers from the National Australian Dictionary Centre there is evidence that \"barley\" (Scotland and the west of England), \"barlies\" (Aberdeen and a few English towns), \"bar\" (Swansea) and \"bars\" (Devon), are used in Australia. In Australia the terms are used regionally with Victorians using \"barley\", New South Welshmen using \"bar\" or \"bars\" and the people of Western Australia using \"barlies.\"\n\nA study undertaken between 1999 and 2001 in New Zealand by lexicographers Laurie and Winifred Bauer on traditional forms of play included truce terms. The terms they described in their study were regional and the most common were \"pegs\" (widespread), \"twigs\" (Taranaki), \"gates\" (Auckland), \"tags\" (Nelson Marlborough), and \"nibs\" (Otago-Southland). In Wellington schools the dominant term was \"fans\", recorded in New Zealand before 1920, which the authors state derives from \"fains\" or \"fain it\" as described by the Opies, itself dating back to Chaucerian times. The most widespread term was \"pegs\", derived from \"pax\". Apparently unrecorded before World War II this appears to have first changed to \"pags\", probably from being shouted out at length, and then further mutated by virtue of broad New Zealand accents to \"pegs\". The Bauers thought the most likely hypothesis for the use of this rather upper class term from the UK, was that it derived from books and stories about UK public schools. Similarly they thought \"nibs\" derived from \"nix\", possibly via \"nigs\", originally from South Africa though unknown to the Opies save for a very small area of \"nicks\" possibly from \"nicklas\". \"Nix\" is also UK public school slang though not as a truce term. \"Nixs\" and \"flix\" were recorded as having been described by a South African boy as prevalent in South Africa, and were thought by a South African linguist to have derived from an Afrikaans term.\n\nMany of the common truce terms recorded by the Bauers such as \"bags\", \"poison\", \"gates\", \"tags\", \"flicks\", are not listed by the Opies although they speculated that both \"bags\" and \"tags\" may derive from \"pax\".\n\nIn a study undertaken by historians Mary and Herbert Knapp in the 1970s, informants remembering terms from the 1930s reported \"kings X\" and \"kings\". The use of \"kings X\" before the 1930s is well-recorded. The 1985 edition of the \"Dictionary of American Regional English\" records the historical use of \"kings ex\", \"kings sax\", \"kings cruse\", \"kings excuse\" and \"kings\", chiefly west of the Mississippi River, the Gulf States and Ohio Valley. The earliest recorded use cited in the dictionary is of \"kings cruse\" in 1778 during an adult fight.\n\nScholarly speculation in the late nineteenth century postulated that \"kings X\" derived from \"kings truce\", rendered as \"kings cruse\" and then \"kings excuse\", becoming \"kings X\" as a shortened form. The \"Dictionary of American Regional English\" cites the Opies as a source for the derivation of the terms and states that \"exes\" probably refers to the use of crossed fingers, an important part of the demand for a truce, rather than deriving from \"excuse\" as originally thought. However, the Knapps state that although the Opies do not record \"kings X\" as such in the UK, they do record \"kings\", \"crosses\", \"exes\", \"cruse\" and \"truce\". They conclude that \"kings X\" derived from the users of \"kings\" and \"exes\" settling in the same areas of the US—the terms were then combined and shortened. \"Kings cruse\", once popular in the US, might be accounted for in a similar manner. \"Barley\" has been recorded as a truce term in Ohio, Wisconsin, and Virginia.\n\nThe Knapps study in Monroe County, Indiana, found \"time-out\" and \"times\" to be by far the most prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included \"I've got times\" and \"time\". Very few children reported the more traditional \"kings\", \"queens\" or \"I've got kings X\". The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. \"Time-out\" clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of \"time-out\" or \"time\" as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, only a small number of respondents reported anything other than \"time-out\" and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included \"pax\", \"safe\", \"base\" or \"home-base\" and \"freeze\" with one small area of \"fins\" (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that \"time-out\" had, since the 1950s, supplanted \"kings ex\" as the most popular truce term.\n\nThe use of \"times\" rather than \"time-out\" and \"I've got times\" rather than \"I call time\" appears to have been influenced by older forms such as \"kings\" and \"I've got kings X\". There was also one report of \"times X\". Similarly derivatives of \"time-out\" are often accompanied by the traditional crossed fingers.\n\nIn France children use the word \"pouce\" as the equivalent of the English \"pax\" and the American \"time-out\". The literal translation of pouce is thumb or big toe.\n\"Lu !\" is -- or was -- a common truce term in Châteauroux, central France, in the fifties and sixties.\n\nThe Opies found that in England and Wales children usually held up crossed fingers. Sometimes crossing the fingers of both hands was required and occasionally the feet as well. The Opies found one area, Headington, where sitting cross-legged was required. At Lydney, children could raise their right hand palm forward, whilst in Bradford-on-Avon the hand was held up with three fingers extended. In some parts of Scotland the custom was to put up one's thumbs, sometimes licking them first. This also occurred in a few places in Lancashire. Anecdotally, the raising of a thumb may also accompany the use of \"pouce\" in France.\n\nThe 1988 Croydon study found a variety of gestures in common use. These were crossed fingers of one hand (44%), crossed fingers of both hands (26%), thumbs through fingers (6%) (boys only) and arms crossed across the chest (2%). Other gestures, reported in ones and twos, included miming an injection into the arm, licking the thumb, making a T-shape with the hands, three fingers held up and the \"Vulcan\" sign from Star Trek. Virtually all schools reported the use of crossed fingers.\n\nThe holding up of one hand with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying \"time-out\". The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching the bottom of the horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern \"time-out\" has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.\n\n"}

Winnicott used true self to describe a sense of self based on spontaneous authentic experience, and a feeling of being alive, having a real self. The false self, by contrast, Winnicott saw as a defensive façade – one which in extreme cases could leave its holders lacking spontaneity and feeling dead and empty, behind a mere appearance of being real.\n\nTo maintain their self-esteem, and protect their vulnerable true selves, narcissists need to control others' behavior – particularly that of their children, seen as extensions of themselves.\n\nWinnicott saw the true self as rooted from early infancy in the experience of being alive, including blood pumping and lungs breathing – what Winnicott called simply being. Out of this, the baby creates the experience of a sense of reality, a sense that life is worth living. The baby's spontaneous, nonverbal gestures derive from that instinctual sense, and if responded to by the mother, become the basis for the continuing development of the true self.\n\nHowever, when what Winnicott was careful to describe as good enough parenting – i.e., not necessarily perfect! – was \"not\" in place, the infant's spontaneity was in danger of being encroached on by the need for compliance with the parents' wishes/expectations. The result for Winnicott could be the creation of what he called the false self, where \"Other people's expectations can become of overriding importance, overlaying or contradicting the original sense of self, the one connected to the very roots of one's being\". The danger he saw was that \"through this false self, the infant builds up a false set of relationships, and by means of introjections even attains a show of being real\", while, in fact, merely concealing a barren emptiness behind an independent-seeming façade.\n\nThe danger was particularly acute where the baby had to provide attunement for the mother/parents, rather than vice versa, building up a sort of dissociated recognition of the object on an impersonal, not personal and spontaneous basis. But while such a pathological false self stifled the spontaneous gestures of the true self in favour of a lifeless imitation, Winnicott nevertheless considered it of vital importance in preventing something worse: the annihilating experience of the exploitation of the hidden true self itself.\n\nThere was much in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for his concept of the false self. Helene Deutsch had described the \"as if\" personalities, with their pseudo relationships substituting for real ones. Winnicott's analyst, Joan Riviere, had explored the concept of the narcissist's masquerade – superficial assent concealing a subtle hidden struggle for control. Freud's own late theory of the ego as the product of identifications came close to viewing it only as a false self; while Winnicott's true/false distinction has also been compared to Michael Balint's \"basic fault\" and to Ronald Fairbairn's notion of the \"compromised ego\".\n\nErich Fromm, in his book \"The Fear of Freedom\" distinguished between original self and pseudo self – the inauthenticality of the latter being a way to escape the loneliness of freedom; while much earlier the existentialist like Kierkegaard had claimed that \"to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair\" – the despair of choosing \"to be another than himself\".\n\nKaren Horney, in her 1950 book, \"Neurosis and Human Growth\", based her idea of \"true self\" and \"false self\" through the view of self-improvement, interpreting it as real self and ideal self, with the real self being what one currently is and the ideal self being what one could become. (See also Karen Horney § Theory of the self).\n\nThe last half-century have seen Winnicott's ideas extended and applied in a variety of contexts, both in psychoanalysis and beyond.\n\nKohut extended Winnicott's work in his investigation of narcissism, seeing narcissists as evolving a defensive armor around their damaged inner selves. He considered it less pathological to identify with the damaged remnants of the self, than to achieve coherence through identification with an external personality at the cost of one's own autonomous creativity.\n\nAlexander Lowen identified narcissists as having a true and a false, or superficial, self. The false self rests on the surface, as the self presented to the world. It stands in contrast to the true self, which resides behind the facade or image. This true self is the feeling self, but it is a self that must be hidden and denied. Since the superficial self represents submission and conformity, the inner or true self is rebellious and angry. This underlying rebellion and anger can never be fully suppressed since it is an expression of the life force in that person. But because of the denial, it cannot be expressed directly. Instead it shows up in the narcissist's acting out. And it can become a perverse force.\n\nJames F. Masterson argued that all the personality disorders crucially involve the conflict between a person's two selves: the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the true self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders is an attempt to put people back in touch with their real selves.\n\nSymington developed Winnicott's contrast between true and false self to cover the \"sources\" of personal action, contrasting an autonomous and a discordant source of action – the latter drawn from the internalisation of external influences and pressures. Thus for example parental dreams of self-glorification by way of their child's achievements can be internalised as an alien discordant source of action. Symington stressed however the \"intentional\" element in the individual's abandoning the autonomous self in favour of a false self or narcissistic mask – something he considered Winnicott to have overlooked.\n\nAs part of what has been described as a personal mission by self-confessed narcissist and author Sam Vaknin to raise the profile of the condition. Vaknin has highlighted the role of the false self in narcissism. The false self replaces the narcissist's true self and is intended to shield him from hurt and narcissistic injury by self-imputing omnipotence. The narcissist pretends that his false self is real and demands that others affirm this confabulation, meanwhile keeping his real imperfect true self under wraps.\n\nFor Vaknin, the false self is by far more important to the narcissist than his dilapidated, dysfunctional true self; and in contrast to the psychoanalysts he does not believe in the ability to resuscitate it through therapy.\n\nAlice Miller cautiously warns that a child/patient may not have \"any\" formed true self, waiting behind the false self facade; and that as a result freeing the true self is not as simple as the Winnicottian image of the butterfly emerging from its cocoon. If a true self can be developed, however, she considered that the empty grandiosity of the false self could give way to a new sense of autonomous vitality.\n\nSusie Orbach saw the false self as an overdevelopment (under parental pressure) of certain aspects of the self at the expense of other aspects – of the full potential of the self – producing thereby an abiding distrust of what emerges spontaneously from the individual himself or herself. Orbach went on to extend Winnicott's account of how environmental failure can lead to an inner splitting of mind and body, so as to cover the idea of the false body – falsified sense of one's own body. Orbach saw the female false body in particular as built upon identifications with others, at the cost of an inner sense of authenticity and reliability. Breaking up a monolithic but false body-sense in the process of therapy could allow for the emergence of a range of authentic (even if often painful) body feelings in the patient.\n\nJungians have explored the overlap between Jung's concept of the persona and Winnicott's false self; but, while noting similarities, consider that only the most rigidly defensive persona approximates to the pathological status of the false self.\n\nDaniel Stern considered Winnicott's sense of \"going on being\" as constitutive of the core, pre-verbal self. He also explored how language could be used to reinforce a false sense of self, leaving the true self linguistically opaque and disavowed. He ended however by proposing a three-fold division of social, private, and of disavowed self.\n\nNeville Symington criticised Winnicott for failing to integrate his false self insight with the theory of ego and id. Similarly, continental analysts like Jean-Bertrand Pontalis have made use of true/false self as a \"clinical\" distinction, while having reservations about its theoretical status.\n\nThe philosopher Michel Foucault took issue more broadly with the concept of a true self on the anti-essentialist grounds that the self was a construct – something one had to evolve through a process of subjectification, an \"aesthetics\" of self-formation, not something simply waiting to be uncovered: \"we have to create ourselves as a work of art\".\n\n\n\n"}
