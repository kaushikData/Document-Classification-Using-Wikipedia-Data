The allegory is thought to have been originally a work in its own right. The text is dated to the 2nd or 3rd century and is attested Greek and Coptic. The author claims to be Peter the Apostle, and thus is pseudepigraphical.\n\nThe allegory describes the tale, similar to the Parable of the Pearl in the Gospel of Matthew, of a pearl merchant who is selling a pearl at a great price (note—this text is not to be confused with the Mormon scripture \"The Pearl of Great Price\"). The merchant is shunned by the rich but the poor attend him in droves, and learn that the pearl is kept at the home city of the merchant, \"Nine Gates\", rather than being carried on him. As such those who desire it must trek the arduous journey to Nine Gates. \n\nThe name of the merchant is Lithargoel, which the text translates as being \"lightweight, glistening stone\", i.e. the merchant himself is the \"pearl\". Ultimately the merchant reveals himself to be Jesus.\n\n"}

He was also known as a Yoruba translator, a broadcaster, TV exponent and pioneer of the first television station in Africa, Western Nigeria Television (WNTV), now known as the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). He was responsible for translating Nigeria's National Anthem from English to Yoruba, his native language. He also translated speeches being made by former Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria - Chief Bola Ige, former military president of Nigeria - General Ibrahim Babangida, former premier of the Western region of Nigeria - Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Head, National Interim Government of Nigeria - Chief Ernest Shonekan, from English to Yoruba. Faleti has published a dictionary containing the formal or official use of Yoruba names. He has received many awards, both locally and internationally, including the National Honour Of Officer Of the Order of the Niger (OON), Doctor of Letters (D.Litt), Justice of Peace (JP), Jerusalem Pilgrim (JP).

He is the first son of his father, Joseph Akanbi Faleti and the only child of his mother, Durowade Ayinke Faleti. From an early age Alagba Faleti always had passion for drama. Unfortunately, his parents could not fund his education to pursue his dreams due to lack of income, so he decided to put his primary education on hold. He then gathered a couple of interested colleagues and started his own successful theatre group, named Oyo Youth Operatic Society (founded in 1949). Faleti later found his way back to school by getting a job in a primary school, in which he worked for six years to raise enough funds for his secondary schooling with the financial support of his father. In 1966, he attended the University of Dakar in Senegal and obtained a Certificate of proficiency in French Language and Civilization.

Their role is to ascertain that official acts are consistent with the law.

The contracts between authorities and private persons fall usually to the jurisdiction of the general court system. Official decisions contested in administrative courts include:\n\nIn several countries, in addition to general courts, there is a separate system of administrative courts, where the general and administrative systems do not have jurisdiction over each other. Accordingly, there is a local administrative court of first instance, possibly an appeals court and a Supreme Administrative Court separate from the general Supreme Court.\n\nThe parallel system is found in countries like Egypt, Greece, Germany, France, Italy, some of the Nordic Countries, Portugal, Taiwan and others. In France, Greece, Portugal and Sweden, the system has three levels like the general system, with local courts, appeals courts and a Supreme Administrative Court. In Finland, Italy, Poland and Taiwan, the system has two levels, where the court of first instance is a regional court. In Germany, the system is more complicated, and courts are more specialized.\n\nIn Finland, legality of decisions of both state agencies and municipal authorities can be appealed to the administrative courts. In accordance with the principle of the legal autonomy of municipalities, administrative courts can only review and rule on the formal legality of the decision, not its content. In the case of state agencies, administrative courts may rule on the actual content of the decision.\n\nIn the United States, administrative courts are tribunals within administrative agencies, and are distinct from judicial courts. Decisions of administrative courts can be appealed to a judicial court.\n\nNotably, in 1952, the Communist East German government abolished the administrative courts as \"bourgeois\". This limited the citizens' ability to contest official decisions. In 1989, re-establishment of the system began in DDR, but the German reunification made this initiative obsolete.\n\n"}
{"id": "3304510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3304510", "title": "Agency for Cultural Affairs", "text": "Agency for Cultural Affairs\n\nThe is a special body of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). It was set up in 1968 to promote Japanese arts and culture. As of April 2018, it is led by the Commissioner for Cultural Affairs, Ryohei Miyata. \n\nThe agency's budget for FY 2017 rose to ¥104.3 billion. The agency's Cultural Affairs Division disseminated information about the arts within Japan and internationally, and the Cultural Properties Protection Division protected the nation's cultural heritage. The Cultural Affairs Division is concerned with such areas as art and culture promotion, art copyrights, and improvements in the national language. It also supports both national and local arts and cultural festivals, and it funds traveling cultural events in music, theater, dance, art exhibitions, and film-making. Special prizes are offered to encourage young artists and established practitioners, and some grants are given each year to enable them to train abroad. The agency funds national museums of modern art in Kyoto and Tokyo and The National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, which exhibit both Japanese and international shows. The agency also supports the Japan Art Academy, which honors eminent persons of arts and letters, appointing them to membership and offering ￥3.5 million in prize money. Awards are made in the presence of the Emperor, who personally bestows the highest accolade, the Order of Culture. In 1989, for the first time two women — a writer and a costume designer — were nominated for the Order of Cultural Merit, another official honor carrying the same stipend.\n\nThe Cultural Properties Protection Division originally was established to oversee restorations after World War II. As of April 2017, it was responsible for 1,784 historic sites, including the ancient capitals of Asuka, Heijokyo, and Fujiwara, 402 scenic places, and 1,024 national monuments, and for such indigenous fauna as ibis and storks. In addition, about 13,500 items had the lesser designation of Important Cultural Properties, with fine arts and crafts accounting for the largest share, with over 10,000 so designated.\n\nThe government protects buried properties, of which some 300,000 had been identified. During the 1980s, many important prehistoric and historic sites were investigated by the archaeological institutes that the agency funded, resulting in about 2,000 excavations in 1989. The wealth of material unearthed shed new light on the controversial period of the formation of the Japanese state.\n\nA 1975 amendment to the Cultural Properties Protection Act of 1897 enabled the Agency for Cultural Affairs to designate traditional areas and buildings in urban centers for preservation. From time to time, various endangered traditional artistic skills are added to the agency's preservation roster, such as the 1989 inclusion of a kind of ancient doll making.\n\nOne of the most important roles of the Cultural Properties Protection Division is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and performing arts through their living exemplars. Individual artists and groups, such as a dance troupe or a pottery village, are designated as \"mukei bunkazai\" (intangible cultural assets) in recognition of their skill. Major exponents of the traditional arts have been designated as \"ningen kokuho\" (living national treasures). About seventy persons are so honored at any one time; in 1989 the six newly designated masters were a \"kyogen\" (comic) performer, a chanter of \"bunraku\" (puppet) theater, a performer of the \"nagauta shamisen\" (a special kind of stringed instrument), the head potter making Nabeshima decorated porcelain ware, the top pictorial lacquer-ware artist, and a metal-work expert. Each was provided a lifetime annual pension of ￥2 million and financial aid for training disciples.\n\nA number of institutions come under the aegis of the Agency for Cultural Affairs: the national museums of Japanese and Asian art in Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Osaka and Fukuoka, the cultural properties research institutes at Tokyo and Nara, and the national theaters. During the 1980s, the National Noh Theatre and the National Bunraku Theater were constructed by the government.\n\nThe agency is based in the Chiyoda Ward of Tokyo. Its relocation to Kyoto is scheduled by fiscal 2021.\n\n\nThe agency contains the following divisions:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2113504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2113504", "title": "Anationalism", "text": "Anationalism\n\nAnationalism () is a term originating from the community of Esperanto speakers. It denotes a range of cosmopolitan political concepts that combine some or all of the following tendencies and ideas:\n\nAlthough conceived within the World Anational Association (\"SAT\", \"Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda\") and promoted by its founder Eugène Lanti, anationalism is not espoused by that organization as its official ideology.\n\nAnationalistic ideas appeared in embryonic form in the plan for an \"International Esperantist Workers' Federation\" put forth by the Bohemian Esperantist Workers' Federation before World War I. These ideas, having gained impetus as a result of the war, were central to the thinking of the founders of SAT in 1921. They are very apparent in Lanti's work \"For la Neŭtralismon!\" (\"Away with Neutralism!\"), which first appeared under the pseudonym \"Sennaciulo\" (\"Nationless Man\").\n\nThe first members of SAT often regarded anationalism as a kind of all-embracing overall ideology of SAT, and liked to call themselves \"sennaciuloj\" (\"nationless people\"). Nevertheless, prior to the publication of Lanti's \"Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj\" (\"Manifesto of the Anationalists\") \"anationalism\" was a term that was applied to several rather diverse ideas. For many members of SAT who espoused anationalism at that time, it simply meant \"(proletarian) internationalism plus Esperanto\" or it signified a workers' version of L.L. Zamenhof's \"homaranismo\".\n\nA comparison of \"ABC de Sennaciismo\" written by Elsudo (Kolchinski) and published by SAT, with the \"Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj\" (\"Manifesto of the Anationalists\") shows how large a gap existed between various concepts of anationalism. Elsudo clearly defines SAT in his work as a \"movement for anationalism\". Ernst Drezen at the time of the schism in the workers' Esperanto movement of the 1930s, reproached SAT not so much for its \"anationalism\", something the communists within SAT had previously advocated as they understood it, but for its \"Lanti-brand anationalism\".\n\nLittle by little, a concept of anationalism was formulated in articles by Lanti in the organs of SAT.\n\nIn 1928, Lanti published a brochure, \"La Laborista Esperantismo\" (\"Worker Esperantism\"), in which he devoted an entire chapter to the definition of the new term. The anationalist tendency had previously encountered no opposition in the non-partisan organization. But in 1929 SAT entered a crisis, and anationalism became the main argument used by the opposition to attack the organization's leadership.\n\nThat opposition claimed that anationalism was pro-imperialist and, as such, \"counterrevolutionary\". The sudden and unexpected attack moved Lanti to publish anonymously in 1931 a brochure in 3000 copies: \"Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj\", which was later translated into several languages, including a French version that appeared in 2000 copies.\n\nAnationalism was defined as follows in that manifesto: \"What characterizes anationalism is not primarily its acknowledgement of the huge role played by production of artifacts in the world. It is that capability that has made man the king of other living beings. Human beings adapt nature to their own needs, while animals must adapt to nature. Anationalists therefore do not deny the great strength that lies in the human will. They do not doubt that humans cannot shed their own weight or jump away from their own shadow. Nevertheless, the limited space in which man is free to act is relatively large. His will can thus engender great works. We therefore believe that the fateful laws of history are only relative.\"\n\nThe following quotation from the same work, which provides for a more precise understanding of the new doctrine, was denounced in its time by Stalinist internationalists for clearly contradicting the then prevailing theory of \"construction of socialism in one country\": \"The anationalists combat all that is national: national languages and cultures, national customs and traditions. For them, Esperanto is their primary language and they consider national languages to be merely auxiliary. They refuse to participate in any national struggle and they acknowledge as necessary and advantageous to the exploited class only class struggle that seeks to eliminate classes, nationalities and all forms of exploitation.\" (ibid.)\n\nAs the heretical doctrine that was so expressed met up with opposition in SAT, the anationalists coalesced to form a faction independent of the organization, which they continued to support fervently. They began to publish the \"Sennaciista Bulteno\" (\"Anationalist Bulletin\") on a fairly regular basis.\n\nAnarchism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of anationalism as well as of the Esperanto language. After the Spanish Civil War, Francoist Spain persecuted anarchists and Catalan nationalists, among whom the use of Esperanto was extensive.\n\nAfter Lanti's death in 1947 and the post-war reconstitution of SAT, the anationalists revived their SAT faction in 1948 under the chairmanship of R. Roberts. Anationalists in SAT initiated and funded two reeditions of the \"Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj\" (1951 and 1971) and several other of Lanti's writings on anationalism.\n\nIn 1978, the SAT congress in Lectoure passed a resolution over the objections of the anationalists, which declared, among other things: \"The preservation of ethnic language and culture is linked to the struggle for a new social order, and, as such, is part of the general efforts on the part of SAT's members to achieve justice and individual liberty.\"\n\nDuring the 80's, while T. Burnell was the secretary of the Anationalist Faction, a \"Declaration on Anationalism\" was passed, which emphasized the struggle of the anationalists against nationalism and in favor of a general individual right to self-determination including the individual right to define one's own identity as an exercise of free will. The faction remained active, with the exception of periods of inactivity during the 80's and 90's, during which the debate over anationalism continued unabated in \"Sennaciulo\", the monthly organ of SAT.\n\nAt the SAT congress in Nagykanizsa (Hungary) in 2001, the Anationalist Faction of SAT was reestablished as a result of renewed interest in anationalism and related subjects, which had evidenced itself previously, when an \"anationalism\" internet mailing list was founded. During that meeting another \"Declaration on Anationalism\" was passed, which was a revised version of the previous declaration.\n\nThe presently active anationalists in the Anationalist Faction cultivate and develop the universalistic and (radical) antinationalist currents of thought that were characteristic of previous formulations of anationalism. Their orientation is less strictly Lantian than that of previous generations of anationalists, and they do not seek to achieve doctrinal uniformity. Some members of the Faction work to oppose ideologies that have become very influential within the general Esperanto movement in the past decades: ethnism, the instrumentalization of Esperanto in favor of various sorts of identity politics, differentialism (ethnopluralism) and language nationalism and purism (so-called \"language defence\").\n\nOutside of SAT and the Anationalist Faction there are also a number of Esperantists that adhere in various degrees to anationalist ideas. Anationalism has generally not been propagated outside the Esperanto-speaking community. Lanti justified this in Chapter 5 of \"La Laborista Esperantismo\" with the statement that \"disseminating anationalism among those who differ by language would be as foolish as teaching literature to illiterates\". This view, however, has been modified at times, as national language translations of the \"Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj\" were published out of the conviction that this would help to popularize Esperanto. The \"Manifesto\", moreover, concludes with a direct appeal to non-speakers of Esperanto: \"The anationalists call upon the workers of the whole world: Learn Esperanto! Esperantists denationalize yourselves!\"\n\n"}

There is no formal criterion for deeming a language ancient, but a traditional convention is to demarcate as \"ancient\" those languages that existed prior to the 5th century. Linguist Roger Woodward has said that \"[p]erhaps, then, what makes an ancient language different is our awareness that it has outlived those for whom it was an intimate element of the psyche\".\n\nBy this definition, the term includes languages attested from ancient times in the list of languages by first written accounts, and described in historical linguistics, and particularly the languages of classical antiquity, such as Tamil language, Ancient Greek, Hebrew language, Old Persian, Avestan, Middle Persian, Sanskrit language, Chinese language, Latin, Arabic language. The term may also encompass other classical languages and various extinct languages.\n\nThe description of fictional races and realms having their own \"ancient languages\" adds depth and richness to storytelling, even if the vocabulary and grammar of the languages themselves is never provided. Examples of this include a fictional language in the \"Inheritance Cycle\" young-adult novels, the language of the race called Ancients in the Mythology of Stargate, and various languages in writings by J.R.R.

{"id": "842911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842911", "title": "Bipartisanship", "text": "Bipartisanship\n\nBipartisanship, sometimes referred to as nonpartisanship, is a political situation, usually in the context of a two-party system (especially those of the United States and some other western countries), in which opposing political parties find common ground through compromise. This is in contrast to partisanship, where an individual or political party only adheres to their interests without compromise. It has been debated among political theorists however that in practice, each party advances their own political agenda at the expense of the other party because of the conflicting ideologies.\n\nThe adjective \"bipartisan\" can refer to any bill, act, resolution, or other political act in which both of the two major political parties agree about all or many parts of a political choice. Bipartisanship involves trying to find common ground, but there is debate whether the issues needing common ground are peripheral or central ones. Often, compromises are called bipartisan if they reconcile the desires of both parties from an original version of legislation or other proposal. Failure to attain bipartisan support in such a system can easily lead to gridlock, often angering each other and their constituencies. An analysis in \"The New York Times\" in March 2010 suggested that the present state of American politics is marked by \"oppositional politics\" which has left the voters cynical about the process. Bipartisanship requires \"hard work\", is \"sometimes dull\", and entails trying to find \"common ground\" but enables \"serious problem solving\", according to editorial writers at the \"Christian Science Monitor\" in 2010.\n\nAccording to political analyst James Fallows in \"The Atlantic\", bipartisanship is a phenomenon belonging to a two-party system such as the political system of the United States and does not apply to a parliamentary system such as Great Britain since the minority party is not involved in helping write legislation or voting for it. Fallows argues that in a two-party system, the minority party can be obstructionist and thwart the actions of the majority party. However, analyst Anne Applebaum in \"The Washington Post\" suggested that partisanship had been rampant in the United Kingdom and described it as \"a country in which the government and the opposition glower at each other from opposite sides of the House of Commons, in which backbenchers jeer when their opponents speak.\" Applebaum suggested there was \"bipartisanship\" in Britain, meaning a coalition in 2010 between the opposing major parties but that it remained to be seen whether the coalition could stay together to solve serious problems such as tackling Britain's financial crisis.\n\nBipartisanship (in the context of a two-party system) is the opposite of partisanship which is characterized by a lack of cooperation between rival political parties. Framer James Madison argued in \"The Federalist Papers\" that a danger to democracies were factions, which he defined as a group that pushed its interests to the detriment of the national interest. While the framers of the Constitution did not think that political parties would play a role in American politics, political parties have long been a major force in American politics, and the nation has alternated between periods of intense party rivalry and partisanship, as well as periods of bipartisanship. According to Robert Siegel of \"National Public Radio\", there has been virtually no cooperation between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. during the few years before 2010.\n\nBipartisanship can also be between two or more opposite groups (e.g. liberal and conservative) to agree and determine a plan of action on an urgent matter that is of great importance to voters. This interpretation brings bipartisanship closer to the more applied notion of postpartisan decision-making; a solution-focused approach that creates a governance model with third-party arbiters used to detect bias.\n\nIt is also argued that bipartisanship exists in policy-making that does not have bipartisan support. This is the case if it involves bipartisan exchanges. This element is a central feature in the legislative process and is a bipartisan concept in the sense that it serves as a mechanism for achieving consensus and cooperation.\n\nThere have been periods of bipartisanship in American politics, such as when the Republicans supported legislation by Democratic President Johnson in the early 1960s, and when Democrats worked with Republican President Reagan in the 1980s. It is claimed that the non-partisanship in foreign policy was a precursor to the concept of modern bipartisanship in the U.S. politics. This was articulated in 1912 by President William Howard Taft, who stated that the fundamental foreign policies of the United States should be raised above party differences. In recent years, this was also shown in the case of George H.W. Bush's administration, which began with an atmosphere of bipartisanship on foreign policy in Washington. During this period, the concept of bipartisanship implied a consensus not only between the two parties but also the executive and legislative branches of the government to implement foreign policy. This was seen in the article \"Bipartisan Objectives for American Foreign Policy\", authored by Henry Kissinger, Richard Nixon's Secretary of State, and Cyrus Vance, who was Secretary during Jimmy Carter's administration. \n\nIn the United States in 2010, however, there was wide disagreement between the Republicans and Democrats because the minority party has been voting as a bloc against major legislation, according to James Fallows in \"The Atlantic\". In 2010, the minority party has the ability to \"discipline its ranks\" so that none join the majority, and this situation in the Congress is unprecedented, according to Fallows. He sees this inability to have bipartisanship as evidence of a \"structural failure of American government.\" Adviser to President Obama, Rahm Emanuel, said the period from 2008–2010 was marked by extreme partisanship. After the U.S. elections of 2010, with sizeable gains by Republicans in the House and Senate, analyst Charles Babington of the Associated Press suggested that both parties remained far apart on major issues such as immigration and Medicare while there may be chances for agreement about lesser issues such as electric cars, nuclear power, and tax breaks for businesses; Babington was not optimistic about chances for bipartisanship on major issues in the next few years. While analyst Benedict Carey writing in \"The New York Times\" agrees political analysts tend to agree that government will continue to be divided and marked by paralysis and feuding, there was research suggesting that humans have a \"profound capacity through which vicious adversaries can form alliances,\" according to Berkeley professor Dacher Keltner.\n\nA call for bipartisanship is often made by presidents who \"can't get their way in Congress,\" according to one view. Military policies of the Cold War and actions like the Iraq War were promoted and supported, through the mass media, as bipartisan acts.\n\nBipartisanship has been criticized because it can obscure the differences between parties, making voting for candidates based on policies difficult in a democracy. Additionally, the concept of bipartisanship has been criticized as discouraging agreements between more than two parties, thus exercising a tyranny of the majority by forcing voters to side with one of the two largest parties.\n"}

It was composed somewhere between the 10th and 13th centuries.

Bogurodzica also accompanied the coronation ceremonies of the first Jagiellonian kings.\n\nIt was recorded in writing at the beginning of the 15th century.

In 1509 the song was printed in Kraków in Jan Łaski's Statut.\n\nThe origin of the song is not clear, although St Adalbert is a likely author. It used to be related either to Latin liturgy, the tradition of church hymns, Greek or Old Church Slavonic influences, Western or Eastern culture. The two initial stanzas were created first - probably in the middle or at the end of the thirteenth century, or possibly at the very beginning of the fourteenth century.\n\nBogurodzica is a prayer hymn whose first stanza contains an invocation to Christ through the intercession of Mary. It begins with an apostrophe to her - to the Mother of Christ, the Virgin, praised by God, the chosen one. After the apostrophe, there is an appeal to Mary to win favour for people from her Son.\n\nThe second stanza begins with a direct addresses to Christ (called God's Son) - with an invocation to John the Baptist who can support human imploring. The prayer closing this stanza contains a request that Christ give people a blissful stay on earth and, after death, everlasting existence in heaven. The subsequent stanzas develop various motifs: Easter, the Passion, a litany - with invocations to the saints.\n\nBogurodzica was initially connected with the mass and procession but already in the fifteenth century it became a knight's battle hymn. Thanks to Jan Długosz (historian, author of Annales seu Cronicae incliti Regni Poloniae) we know that it was sung at Grunwald in 1410 as well as before other battles in subsequent years. It also accompanied the coronation ceremonies of Władysław III of Poland. That is why Długosz called Bogurodzica \"carmen patrium\" (the hymn of the motherland). In the next centuries the hymn lost its significance. It regained its position of \"carmen patrium\" in the nineteenth century and has held it to the present day.\n]\n\n\n\n"}

However, his proof was faulty and in 1922 he retracted his claim and stated the conjecture as an open problem.\n\nThe totient function \"φ\"(\"n\") is equal to 2 when \"n\" is one of the three values 3, 4, and 6. Thus, if we take any one of these three values as \"n\", then either of the other two values can be used as the \"m\" for which \"φ\"(\"m\") = \"φ\"(\"n\").\n\nSimilarly, the totient is equal to 4 when \"n\" is one of the four values 5, 8, 10, and 12, and it is equal to 6 when \"n\" is one of the four values 7, 9, 14, and 18. In each case, there is more than one value of \"n\" having the same value of \"φ\"(\"n\").\n\nThe conjecture states that this phenomenon of repeated values holds for every \"n\".\n\nThere are very high lower bounds for Carmichael's conjecture that are relatively easy to determine. Carmichael himself proved that any counterexample to his conjecture (that is, a value \"n\" such that φ(\"n\") is different from the totients of all other numbers) must be at least 10, and Victor Klee extended this result to 10. A lower bound of formula_1was given by Schlafly and Wagon, and a lower bound of formula_2 was determined by Kevin Ford in 1998.\n\nThe computational technique underlying these lower bounds depends on some key results of Klee that make it possible to show that the smallest counterexample must be divisible by squares of the primes dividing its totient value. Klee's results imply that 8 and Fermat primes (primes of the form 2 + 1) excluding 3 do not divide the smallest counterexample. Consequently, proving the conjecture is equivalent to proving that the conjecture holds for all integers congruent to 4 (mod 8).\n\nFord also proved that if there exists a counterexample to the Conjecture, then a positive fraction (that is infinitely many) of the integers are likewise counterexamples.\n\nAlthough the conjecture is widely believed, Carl Pomerance gave a sufficient condition for an integer \"n\" to be a counterexample to the conjecture . According to this condition, \"n\" is a counterexample if for every prime \"p\" such that \"p\" − 1 divides \"φ\"(\"n\"), \"p\" divides \"n\". However Pomerance showed that the existence of such an integer is highly improbable. Essentially, one can show that if the first \"k\" primes \"p\" congruent to 1 (mod \"q\") (where \"q\" is a prime) are all less than \"q\", then such an integer will be divisible by every prime and thus cannot exist. In any case, proving that Pomerance's counterexample does not exist is far from proving Carmichael's Conjecture. However if it exists then infinitely many counterexamples exist as asserted by Ford.\n\nAnother way of stating Carmichael's conjecture is that, if\n\"A\"(\"f\") denotes the number of positive integers \"n\" for which \"φ\"(\"n\") = \"f\", then \"A\"(\"f\") can never equal 1. Relatedly, Wacław Sierpiński conjectured that every positive integer other than 1 occurs as a value of A(\"f\"), a conjecture that was proven in 1999 by Kevin Ford.\n\n"}
{"id": "205643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205643", "title": "Cheyenne language", "text": "Cheyenne language\n\nThe Cheyenne language (), is the Native American language spoken by the Cheyenne people, predominantly in present-day Montana and Oklahoma, in the United States. It is part of the Algonquian language family. Like all other Algonquian languages, it has complex agglutinative morphology. This language is considered endangered, at different levels, in both states.\n\nCheyenne is one of the Algonquian languages, which is a sub-category of the Algic languages. Specifically, it is a Plains Algonquian language. However, Plains Algonquian, which also includes Arapaho and Blackfoot, is an areal rather than genetic subgrouping.\n\nCheyenne is spoken on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana and in Oklahoma. At the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, where as of March 2013, there were approximately 10,050 enrolled tribal members, of which about 4,939 resided on the reservation; slightly more than a quarter of the population five years or older spoke a language other than English.\n\nThe Cheyenne language is considered \"definitely endangered\" in Montana and \"critically endangered\" in Oklahoma by the UNESCO. In Montana the number of speakers are about 1700 according to the UNESCO. In the state of Oklahoma, there are only 400 elderly speakers. There is no current information on any other state in the United States regarding the Cheyenne language.\n\nThe 2017 film \"Hostiles\" features extensive dialogue in Northern Cheyenne. The film's producers hired experts in the language and culture to ensure authenticity.\n\nIn 1997, the Cultural Affairs Department of Chief Dull Knife College applied to the Administration for Native Americans for an approximately $50,000 language preservation planning grant. The department wanted to use this money to assess the degree to which Cheyenne was being spoken on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Following this, the department wanted to use the compiled data to establish long-term community language goals, and to prepare Chief Dull Knife College to implement a Cheyenne Language Center and curriculum guide. In 2015, the Chief Dull Knife College sponsored the 18th Annual Language Immersion Camp. This event was organized into two weeklong sessions, and its aim was to educate the younger generation on their ancestral language. The first session focused on educating 5-10 year olds, while the second session focused on 11- to 18-year-olds. Certified Cheyenne language instructors taught daily classes. Ultimately, the camp provided approximately ten temporary jobs for fluent speakers on the impoverished reservation. The State of Montana has passed a law that guarantees support for tribal language preservation for Montana tribes. Classes in the Cheyenne language are available at Chief Dull Knife College in Lame Deer, Montana, at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, and at Watonga High School in Watonga, Oklahoma.\n\nCheyenne has three basic vowel qualities ([e a o]) that take four tones: high tone as in á [á]); low tone as in a [à]; mid tone as in ā [ā]; and rising tone as in ô [ǒ]. Tones are often not represented in the orthography. Vowels can also be voiceless (e.g. ė [e̥]). The high and low tones are phonemic, while voiceless vowels' occurrence is determined by the phonetic context, making them allophones of the voiced vowels.\n\nThe phoneme /h/ is realized as [s] in the environment between /e/ and /t/ (h > s / e _ t). /h/ is realized as [ʃ] between [e] and [k] (h > ʃ / e _ k) i.e. /nahtóna/ \"nȧhtona\" - \"alien\", /nehtóna/ \"nėstona\" - \"your daughter\", /hehke/ \"heške\" - \"his mother\". The digraph \"ts\" represents assibilated /t/; a phonological rule of Cheyenne is that underlying /t/ becomes affricated before an /e/ . Therefore, \"ts\" is not a separate phoneme, but an allophone of /t/. The sound is not a phoneme, but derives from other phonemes, including (when precedes or follows a non-front vowel, /a/ or /o/), and the past tense morpheme /h/ which is pronounced when it precedes a morpheme which starts with /h/.\nThe Cheyenne orthography of 14 letters is neither a pure phonemic system nor a phonetic transcription; it is, in the words of linguist Wayne Leman, a \"pronunciation orthography\". In other words, it is a practical spelling system designed to facilitate proper pronunciation. Some allophonic variants, such as voiceless vowels, are shown. represents the phoneme symbolized /e/, but is usually pronounced as a phonetic and sometimes varies to . represents .\n\nThe systematic phonemes of Cheyenne are distinguished by seven two-valued features. Scholar Donald G. Frantz defined these features as follows:\n\n0 indicates the value is indeterminable/irrelevant. A blank indicates the value is specifiable, but context is required (even though any value could be inserted because the post-cyclical rules would change the value to the correct one). Parentheses enclose values that are redundant according to the phonological rules; these values simply represent the results of these rules.\n\nCheyenne has 14 orthographic letters representing 13 phonemes. [x] is written as \"x\" orthographically but is not a phoneme. This count excludes the results of allophonic devoicing, which are spelled with a dot overtop vowels. Devoicing naturally occurs in the last vowel of a word or phrase. It can also occur in vowels at the penultimate and prepenultimate positions within a word. Non-high [a] and [o] is also usually devoiced preceding \"h\" plus a stop. Phonemic /h/ is absorbed by a preceding voiceless vowel. Examples are given below.\n\n\nDevoicing occurs when certain vowels directly precede the consonants [t], [s], [ʃ], [k], or [x] that are followed by an [e]. This rule is linked to the rule of \"e\"-epenthesis, which simply states that [e] appears in the environment of a consonant and a word boundary.\n\n\nA vowel that does not have a high pitch is devoiced if it is followed by a voiceless fricative and not preceded by [h].\n\n\nNon-high [a] and [o] become at least partially devoiced when they are preceded by a voiced vowel and followed by an [h], a consonant and two or more syllables.\n\n\"émane\" [ímaṅi] 'He is drinking.'\n\nWhen preceding a voiceless segment, a consonant is devoiced.\n\n\nThe [h] is absorbed when preceded or followed by voiceless vowels.\n\nThere are several rules that govern pitch use in Cheyenne. Pitch can be ˊ = high, unmarked = low, ˉ = mid, and ˆ = raised high. According to linguist Wayne Leman, some research shows that Cheyenne may have a stress system independent from that of pitch. If this is the case, the stress system's role is very minor in Cheyenne prosody. It would have no grammatical or lexical function, unlike pitch.\n\nA high pitch becomes a raised high when it is not followed by another high vowel and precedes an underlying word-final high.\n\nA low vowel is raised to the high position when it precedes a high and is followed by a word final high.\n\nA low vowel becomes a mid when it is followed by a word-final high but not directly preceded by a high vowel.\n\nA high vowel becomes low if it comes before a high and followed by a phonetic low.\n\nAccording to Leman, \"some verbal prefixes and preverbs go through the process of Word-Medial High-Raising. A high is raised if it follows a high (which is not a trigger for the High Push-Over rule) and precedes a phonetic low. One or more voiceless syllables may come between the two highs. (A devoiced vowel in this process must be underlyingly low, not an underlyingly high vowel which has been devoiced by the High-Pitch Devoicing rule.)\" \n\nSyllables with high pitch (tone) are relatively high pitched and are marked by an acute accent, á, é, and ó. The following pairs of phrases demonstrate pitch contrasts in the Cheyenne language: \nAs noted by Donald G. Frantz, phonological rules dictate some pitch patterns, as indicated by the frequent shift of accent when suffixes are added (e.g. compare \"matšėškōme\" \"raccoon\" and \"mátšėškomeo'o\" \"raccoons\"). In order for the rules to work, certain vowels are assigned inherent accent. For example, the word for \"badger\" has a permanent accent position: \"ma'háhko'e\" (sg.), \"ma'háhko'eo'o\" (pl.)\n\nThe research of linguist Paul Proulx provides an explanation for how these reflexes develop in Cheyenne: \"First, *\"n\" and *\"h\" drop and all other consonants give glottal catch before *\"k\". *\"k\" then drops except in element-final position. Next, there is an increment before any remaining *\"k\" not preceded by a glottal catch: a secondary \"h\" (replaced by \"š\" after \"e\") ) in words originating in the Cheyenne Proper dialect, and a vowel in those originating in the Sutaio (So'taa'e) dialect. In the latter dialect the *\"k\" gives glottal catch in a word-final syllable (after the loss of some final syllables) and drops elsewhere, leaving the vowel increment. Sutaio \"'k\" clusters are all reduced to glottal catch.\"\n\nCheyenne is a morphologically polysynthetic language with a sophisticated, agglutinating verb system contrasting a relatively simple noun structure. Many Cheyenne verbs can stand alone in sentences, and can be translated by complete English sentences. Aside from its verb structure, Cheyenne has several grammatical features that are typical of Algonquian languages, including an animate/inanimate noun classification paradigm, an obviative third person and distinction of clusivity in the first person plural pronoun.\n\nLike all Algonquian languages, Cheyenne shows a highly developed modal paradigm. Algonquianists traditionally describe the inflections of verbs in these languages as being divided into three \"orders,\" with each order further subdivided into a series of \"modes,\" each of which communicates some aspect of modality. The charts below provide examples of verb forms of every order in each mode, after Leman (2011) and Mithun (1999).\n\nThis order governs both declarative and interrogative statements. The modes of this order are generally subdivided along lines of evidentiality.\n\nThis order governs a variety of dependent clause types. Leman (2011) characterizes this order of verbs as requiring other verbal elements in order to establish complete meaning. Verbs in the conjunct order are marked with a mode-specific prefix and a suffix marking person, number and animacy.\n\nThe third order governs commands. Cheyenne, in common with several other North American languages, distinguishes two types of imperative mood, one indicating immediate action, and the other indicating delayed action.\n\nThe Cheyenne verb system is very complex and verb constructions are central to the morphosyntax of the language, to the point that even adjectives and even some nouns are largely substantive in nature. Verbs change according to a number of factors, such as modality, person and transitivity, as well as the animacy of the referent, each of these categories being indicated by the addition of an affix to the basic verb stem. There are also several instrumental, locative and adverbial affixes that add further information to the larger verb construction. This can result in very long, complex verbs that are able to stand alone as entire sentences in their own right. \nAll Cheyenne verbs have a rigid templatic structure. The affixes are placed according to the following paradigm:\n\nCheyenne represents the participants of an expression not as separate pronoun words but as affixes on the verb. There are three basic pronominal prefixes in Cheyenne:\n\nThese three basic prefixes can be combined with various suffixes to express all of Cheyenne's pronominal distinctions. For example, the prefix ná- can be combined on a verb with the suffix -me to express the first person plural exclusive.\n\nTense in Cheyenne is expressed by the addition of a specific tense morpheme between the pronominal prefix and the verb stem. Verbs do not always contain tense information, and an unmarked present tense verb can be used to express both past and \"recent\" present tense in conversation. Thus, \"návóómo\" could mean both \"I see him\" and \"I saw him\" depending on the context.\n\nFar past tense is expressed by the morpheme /-h-/, which changes to /-x-/, /-s-/, /-š-/ or /-'-/ before the -h, -t, -k and a vowel, respectively. Thus:\n\n\nSimilarly, the future tense is expressed by the morpheme /-hte/, which changes to -htse after the ná- pronominal, -stse after ne- and -tse in the third-person, with the third-person prefix dropped altogether.\n\nThese prefixes address whether the action of the verb is moving \"toward\" or \"away from\" some entity, usually the speaker.\n\n\nFollowing Algonquianist terminology, Leman (2011) describes \"preverbs\", morphemes which add adjectival or adverbial information to the verb stem. Multiple preverbs can be combined within one verb complex. The following list represents only a small sample.\n\n\nThis large group of suffixes provide information about something associated with the root, usually communicating that the action is done with or to a body part. Thus: \"énėše'xahtse\" (he-wash-mouth) = \"he gargled.\" Following is a sample of medial suffixes:\n\n\nMedial suffixes can also be used with nouns to create compound words or to coin entirely new words from existing morphemes, as in:\n\n\"ka'énė-hôtame\" [short-face-dog] = bulldog\n\nCheyenne verbs take different object agreement endings depending upon the animacy of the subject and the transitivity of the verb itself. Intransitive verbs take endings depending upon the animacy of their subject, whereas transitive verbs take endings that depend upon the animacy of their object. All verbs can therefore be broadly categorized into one of four classes: Animate Intransitive (AI), Inanimate Instransitive (II), Transitive Animate (TA) and Transitive Inanimate (TI). Following are the most common object agreement markers for each verb class.\n\n\nVerbs are negated by the addition of the infix -sâa- immediately after the pronominal affix. This morpheme changes to sáa- in the absence of a pronominal affix, as occurs in the imperative and in some future tense constructions.\n\nNouns are classified according to animacy. They change according to grammatical number (singular and plural) but are not distinguished according to gender or definiteness.\n\nWhen two third persons are referred to by the same verb, the object of the sentence becomes obviated, what Algonquianists refer to as a \"fourth person.\" It is essentially an \"out of focus\" third person. As with possessive obviation above, the presence of a fourth person triggers morphological changes in both the verb and noun. If the obviated entity is an animate noun, it will be marked with an obviative suffix, typically -o or -óho. For example:\n\n\nVerbs register the presence of obviated participants whether or not they are present as nouns. These forms could be likened to a kind of passive voice, although Esteban (2012) argues that since Cheyenne is a \"reference-dominated language where case marking and word order are governed by the necessity to code pragmatic roles,\" a passive-like construction is assumed. This phenomenon is an example of typical Algonquian \"person hierarchy,\" in which animacy and first personhood take precedence over other forms.\n\nBoth animate and inanimate nouns are pluralized by the addition of suffixes. These suffixes are irregular and can change slightly according to a complex system of phonological rules.\n\n\nPossession is denoted by a special set of pronominal suffixes. Following is a list of the most common possession prefixes, although rarely some words take different prefixes. \n\nGenerally, possessive prefixes take a low pitch on the following vowel.\n\nWhen a third person animate noun is possessed by another third person, the noun becomes obviated and takes a different form. Much of the time, this obviated form is identical to the noun's regular plural form, with only a few exceptions. This introduces ambiguity in that it is not always possible to tell whether an obviated noun is singular or plural.\n\nLike all the Algonquian languages, Cheyenne developed from a reconstructed ancestor referred to as Proto-Algonquian (often abbreviated \"PA\"). The sound changes on the road from PA to modern Cheyenne are complex, as exhibited by the development of the PA word \"*erenyiwa\" \"man\" into Cheyenne \"hetane\":\n\nPA *\"θk\" has the Sutaio reflex ' in \"e-nete'e\" \"she tells lies\", but the Cheyenne-Proper reflex \"'k\" in \"hetone'ke\" \"tree-bark\". According to linguist Paul Proulx, this gave off the appearance that \"speakers of both Cheyenne dialects—perhaps mixed bands—were involved in the Arapaho contact that led to this unusual reflex of PA *k.\".\n\nSome Cheyenne words (with the Proto-Algonquian reconstructions where known):\n\nEarly work was done on the Cheyenne language by Rodolphe Charles Petter, a Mennonite missionary based in Lame Deer, Montana, from 1916. Petter published a mammoth dictionary of Cheyenne in 1915.\n\n\n"}

Usually, this problem is studied with the Hamming distance in mind.\n\nMore formally, given \"n\" length-\"m\" strings \"s\", \"s\", ..., \"s\", the closest string problem seeks for a new length-\"m\" string \"s\" such that \"d\"(\"s\",\"s\") ≤ \"k\" for all \"i\", where \"d\" denotes the Hamming distance, and where \"k\" is as small as possible. A decision problem version of the closest string problem, which is NP-complete, instead takes \"k\" as another input and questions whether there is a string within Hamming distance \"k\" of all the input strings.\n\nThe closest string problem can be seen as an instance of the 1-center problem in which the distances between elements are measured using Hamming distance.\n\nIn bioinformatics, the closest string problem is an intensively studied facet of the problem of finding signals in DNA.\n\nInstances of closest string may contain information that is not essential to the problem. In some sense, the usual input of closest string contains information, that does not contribute to the hardness of the problem. For example, if some strings contain the character \"a\", but none contains the character \"z\", replacing all \"a\"s with \"z\"s would yield an essentially equivalent instance, that is: from a solution of the modified instance, the original solution can be restored, and vice versa.\n\nWhen all input strings that share the same length are written on top of each other, they form a matrix. Certain row types have essentially the same implications to the solution. For example, replacing a column with entries (\"a\", \"a\", \"b\") with another column (\"x\", \"x\", \"y\") might lead to a different solution string, but cannot affect solvability, because both columns express the same structure, viz. the first two entries being equal, but different from the third one. \n\nAn input instance can be \"normalized\" by replacing, in each column, the character that occurs the most often with \"a\", the character that occurs the second most often with \"b\", and so forth. Given a solution to the normalized instance, the original instance can be found by remapping the characters of the solution to its original version in every column.\n\nThe order of the columns does not contribute to the hardness of the problem. That means, if we permute all input strings according to a certain permutation π and obtain a solution string \"s\" to that modified instance, then π(\"s\") will be a solution to the original instance.\n\nGiven an instance with three input strings \"uvwx\", \"xuwv\", and \"xvwu\". This could be written as a matrix like this:\n\nThe first column has the values (\"u\", \"x\", \"x\"). As \"x\" is the character that appears the most often, we replace it by \"a\", and we replace \"u\", the second most often character, by \"b\", obtaining the new first column (\"b\", \"a\", \"a\"). The second column has the values (\"v\", \"u\", \"v\"). As for the first column, \"v\" is replaced by \"a\" and \"u\" is replaced by \"b\", obtaining the new second column (\"a\", \"b\", \"a\"). Doing the same with all columns gives the normalized instance\n\nNormalizing the input reduces the alphabet size to at most the number of input strings. This can be useful for algorithms whose running times depend on the alphabet size.\n\nLi et al. evolved a polynomial-time approximation scheme which is practically unusable because of the large hidden constants.\n\nClosest String can be solved in formula_1, where \"k\" is the number of input strings, \"L\" is the length of all strings and \"d\" is the desired maximum distance from the solution string to any input string.\n\nClosest string is a special case of the more general closest substring problem, which is strictly more difficult. While closest string turns out to be fixed-parameter tractable in a number of ways, closest substring is W[1]-hard with regard to these parameters.\n"}

Authoritarianism is thus a defining characteristic, but most scholars will say that more distinguishing traits are needed to make an authoritarian regime fascist.\n\nSimilarly, \"fascism\" as an ideology is also hard to define. Originally, it referred to a totalitarian political movement linked with corporatism which existed in Italy from 1922 to 1943 under the leadership of Benito Mussolini. Many scholars use the word \"fascism\" without capitalization in a more general sense, to refer to an ideology (or group of ideologies) which was influential in many countries at many different times. For this purpose, they have sought to identify what Roger Griffin calls a \"fascist minimum\"—that is, the minimum conditions that a certain political movement must meet in order to be considered \"fascist\". According to most scholars of fascism, there are both left and right influences on fascism as a social movement, and fascism, especially once in power, has historically attacked both left, moderate right wing and the opposition in the radical right in order to maintain power.\n\nScholars have inspected the apocalyptic, millennial and millenarianism aspects of fascism.\n\nBenito Mussolini, who was the first to use the term for his political party in 1915, described fascism in \"Doctrine of Fascism\" as follows:\n\nSergio Panunzio, a former syndicalist who was associated with Benito Mussolini, and who later became a leading fascist theorist, stated that the spirit of fascism was National Syndicalism as formulated by Mussolini before the battle of Vittorio Veneto.\n\nCharles Maurras, leader of Action Française, a far-right political movement, praised Italian fascism, although he argued that it was an incomplete form of his ideal integral nationalism.\n\nWhat in fact is Fascism?

A determination to approach, to threat, to resolve the worker question in itself ... and to unite unions in corporations, to coordinate them, to incorporate the proletariat into the hereditary and traditional activities of the historical State of the Fatherland.\n\nIn his 1995 essay \"Eternal Fascism\", cultural theorist Umberto Eco lists fourteen general properties of fascist ideology. He argues that it is not possible to organise these into a coherent system, but that \"it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it\". He uses the term \"Ur-fascism\" as a generic description of different historical forms of fascism. The fourteen properties are as follows:\n\n\nItalian historian of fascism Emilio Gentile described fascism in 1996 as the \"sacralization of politics\" through totalitarian methods and argued the following ten constituent elements:\n\nA professor of political science emeritus at the U.C. Berkeley, A. James Gregor, contends that fascism was a “variant of Sorelian syndicalism” which also included components of neo-idealism and elitist socialism. Gregor took the position that Stalinism and Fascist totalitarianism would have been impossible without the “transmogrified Marxism, that infilled both.” According to Gregor:\nFascism was a variant of classical Marxism, a belief system that pressed some themes argued by both Marx and Engels until they found expression in the form of ‘national syndicalism’ that was to animate the first Fascism.\n\nFurthermore, he believes that post-Maoist China displays many fascist traits. He has denied that fascism is \"right-wing extremism.\"\n\nHistorian and political scientist Roger Griffin's definition of fascism focuses on the populist fascist rhetoric that argues for a \"re-birth\" of a conflated nation and ethnic people. According to Griffin\n\n[F]ascism is best defined as a revolutionary form of nationalism, one that sets out to be a political, social and ethical revolution, welding the ‘people’ into a dynamic national community under new elites infused with heroic values. The core myth that inspires this project is that only a populist, trans-class movement of purifying, cathartic national rebirth (palingenesis) can stem the tide of decadence\nGriffin writes that a broad scholarly consensus developed in English-speaking social sciences during the 1990s, around the following definition of fascism:\n\n[Fascism is] a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism. As such it is an ideology deeply bound up with modernization and modernity, one which has assumed a considerable variety of external forms to adapt itself to the particular historical and national context in which it appears, and has drawn a wide range of cultural and intellectual currents, both left and right, anti-modern and pro-modern, to articulate itself as a body of ideas, slogans, and doctrine. In the inter-war period it manifested itself primarily in the form of an elite-led \"armed party\" which attempted, mostly unsuccessfully, to generate a populist mass movement through a liturgical style of politics and a programme of radical policies which promised to overcome a threat posed by international socialism, to end the degeneration affecting the nation under liberalism, and to bring about a radical renewal of its social, political and cultural life as part of what was widely imagined to be the new era being inaugurated in Western civilization. The core mobilizing myth of fascism which conditions its ideology, propaganda, style of politics and actions is the vision of the nation's imminent rebirth from decadence.\nGriffin argues that the above definition can be condensed into one sentence: \"Fascism is a political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic form of populist ultra-nationalism.\" The word \"palingenetic\" in this case refers to notions of national rebirth.\n\nClassical liberal economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek, in his 1944 book \"The Road to Serfdom\", argued that socialism and national socialism had similar intellectual roots. “Fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion.”\nHe cited the following exemplary cases of socialist scholars: Werner Sombart was hailed as a Marxist and persecuted for his beliefs, but when he later rejected internationalism and pacifism in favor of German militarism and nationalism, he became an intellectual force for national socialism early on. Johann Plenge, another early national socialist intellectual, saw national socialism as a German adaptation of socialism. Paul Lensch was a socialist politician in the Reichstag who argued for central control of the economy and for militarism that became features of national socialism. He wrote that Western or English liberalism, which includes the ideas of freedom, community, and equality and rule by parliamentary democracy, was anathema in a true Germany, where power should belong to the whole, everyone is given his place, and one either obeys or commands. Oswald Spengler in his early writings advocated many of the ideas shared by German socialists at this time. Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, a patron saint of national socialism, per Hayek, claimed that World War I was a war between liberalism and socialism and that socialism lost. Like Plenge and Lensch, he saw national socialism as socialism adapted to the German character and undefiled by Western ideas of liberalism.\n\nDimitri Kitsikis, a Greek Turkologist and Sinologist, proposed a model of fascism in 1998 featuring 13 categories by which fascist ideologies, movements and establishments can be analyzed and contrasted with others: \n\nUsing this model, Kitsikis argued that Jean-Jacques Rousseau, philosopher and father of the French Revolution, laid the foundations of French Fascism. Kitsikis also applied the model to the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), a Peruvian communist party which claims to follow Maoism. The results of his analysis showed that the party's ideology satisfies all the criteria of nine categories (nine points), some of the criteria of three categories (1.5 points) and none of the criteria of one category (0 points). A total score of 10.5 out of a possible 13 shows that Shining Path actually follows a fascist ideology.\n\nErnst Nolte, a German historian and Hegelian philosopher, defined fascism in 1965 as a reaction against other political movements, especially Marxism: \"Fascism is anti-Marxism which seeks to destroy the enemy by the evolvement of a radically opposed and yet related ideology and by the use of almost identical and yet typically modified methods, always, however, within the unyielding framework of national self-assertion and autonomy.\"\n\nKevin Passmore, a history lecturer at Cardiff University, defines fascism in his 2002 book \"Fascism: A Very Short Introduction\". His definition is directly descended from the view put forth by Ernesto Laclau:\n\nFascism is a set of ideologies and practices that seeks to place the nation, defined in exclusive biological, cultural, and/or historical terms, above all other sources of loyalty, and to create a mobilized national community. Fascist nationalism is reactionary in that it entails implacable hostility to socialism and feminism, for they are seen as prioritizing class or gender rather than nation. This is why fascism is a movement of the \"extreme\" right. Fascism is also a movement of the \"radical\" right because the defeat of socialism and feminism and the creation of the mobilized nation are held to depend upon the advent to power of a new elite acting in the name of the people, headed by a charismatic leader, and embodied in a mass, militarized party. Fascists are pushed towards conservatism by common hatred of socialism and feminism, but are prepared to override conservative interests - family, property, religion, the universities, the civil service - where the interests of the nation are considered to require it. Fascist radicalism also derives from a desire to assuage discontent by accepting specific demands of the labour and women's movements, so long as these demands accord with the national priority. Fascists seek to ensure the harmonization of workers' and women's interests with those of the nation by mobilizing them within special sections of the party and/or within a corporate system. Access to these organizations and to the benefits they confer upon members depends on the individual's national, political, and/or racial characteristics. All aspects of fascist policy are suffused with ultranationalism.\nRobert Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University, defines fascism in his 2004 book \"The Anatomy of Fascism\" as:\n\nA form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.\nHistorian of fascism Stanley G. Payne created a lengthy list of characteristics to identify fascism in 1995: \n\nOne of the world's leading experts on fascism, Zeev Sternhell, describes Fascism as a reaction against modernity and a backlash against the changes it had caused to society, as a \"rejection of the prevailing systems: liberalism and Marxism, positivism and democracy.\" At the same time, Sternhell says that part of what made Fascism unique was that it wanted to retain the benefits of progress and modernism while rejecting the values and social changes that had come with it; Fascism embraced liberal market-based economics and the violent revolutionary rhetoric of Marxism, but rejected their philosophical principles. \n\nJohn Weiss, a Wayne State University history professor, described fascist ideas in his 1967 book, \"The Fascist Tradition: Radical Right-Wing Extremism in Modern Europe\": organicist conceptions of community, philosophical idealism, idealization of \"manly\" (usually peasant or village) virtues, resentment of mass democracy, elitist conceptions of political and social leadership, racism (and usually anti-Semitism), militarism and Imperialism.\n\nJohn Lukacs, Hungarian-American historian and Holocaust survivor, argues in \"the Hitler of History\" that there is no such thing as generic fascism, claiming that National Socialism and Italian Fascism were more different than similar and that, alongside communism, they were ultimately radical forms of populism.\n\nMarxists argue that fascism represents the last attempt of a ruling class (specifically, the capitalist bourgeoisie) to preserve its grip on power in the face of an imminent proletarian revolution. Fascist movements are not necessarily \"created\" by the ruling class, but they can only gain political power with the help of that class and with funding from big business. Once in power, the fascists serve the interests of their benefactors.\n\nAn early study of fascism was written by Clara Zetkin for the Third Plenum in 1923: \n\"Fascism is the concentrated expression of the general offensive undertaken by the world bourgeoisie against the proletariat... fascism [is] an expression of the decay and disintegration of the capitalist economy and as a symptom of the bourgeois state’s dissolution. We can combat fascism only if we grasp that it rouses and sweeps along broad social masses who have lost the earlier security of their existence and with it, often, their belief in social order... It will be much easier for us to defeat Fascism if we clearly and distinctly study its nature. Hitherto there have been extremely vague ideas upon this subject not only among the large masses of the workers, but even among the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat and the Communists... The Fascist leaders are not a small and exclusive caste; they extend deeply into wide elements of the population.\n\nGeorgi Dimitrov, Bulgarian Communist, was a theorist of capitalism who expanded Lenin's ideas and the work of Clara Zetkin.\n\nDelivering an official report to the 7th World Congress of the Communist Third International in August 1935, Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov cited the definition of fascism formulated with the help of Clara Zetkin at the Third Plenum as \"the open, terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, and most imperialist elements of finance capital\".\n\nAccording to Dimitrov:\n\"Fascism is not a form of state power \"standing above both classes -- the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,\" as Otto Bauer, for instance, has asserted. It is not \"the revolt of the petty bourgeoisie which has captured the machinery of the state,\" as the British Socialist Brailsford declares. No, fascism is not a power standing above class, nor government of the petty bourgeoisie or the lumpen-proletariat over finance capital. Fascism is the power of finance capital itself. It is the organization of terrorist vengeance against the working class and the revolutionary section of the peasantry and intelligentsia. In foreign policy, fascism is jingoism in its most brutal form, fomenting bestial hatred of other nations... The development of fascism, and the fascist dictatorship itself, assume different forms in different countries, according to historical, social and economic conditions and to the national peculiarities, and the international position of the given country.\"\n\nIn the posthumously published 1944 tract, \"Fascism: What It Is and How to Fight It,\" Communist opposition leader Leon Trotsky noted: \"The historic function of fascism is to smash the working class, destroy its organizations, and stifle political liberties when the capitalists find themselves unable to govern and dominate with the help of democratic machinery.\" Amadeo Bordiga argued that fascism is merely another form of bourgeois rule, on the same level as bourgeois democracy or traditional monarchy, and that it is not particularly reactionary or otherwise exceptional.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Marxism\" defines fascism as \"right-wing, fiercely nationalist, subjectivist in philosophy, and totalitarian in practice\", and identifies it as \"an extreme reactionary form of capitalist government.\" To quote it:\n\nThere are several fundamental characteristics of fascism, among them are: \n\nAmerican statesman Franklin D. Roosevelt, who led the US into war with the fascist Axis powers, wrote about fascism:\n\nAnti-fascist author George Orwell describes fascism in a 1941 essay, \"\", in economic terms:\nFascism, at any rate the German version, is a form of capitalism that borrows from Socialism just such features as will make it efficient for war purposes... It is a planned system geared to a definite purpose, world-conquest, and not allowing any private interest, either of capitalist or worker, to stand in its way.\n\nWriting for the \"Tribune\" in 1944, Orwell stated:\n...It is not easy, for instance, to fit Germany and Japan into the same framework, and it is even harder with some of the small states which are describable as Fascist. It is usually assumed, for instance, that Fascism is inherently warlike, that it thrives in an atmosphere of war hysteria and can only solve its economic problems by means of war preparation or foreign conquests. But clearly this is not true of, say, Portugal or the various South American dictatorships. Or again, antisemitism is supposed to be one of the distinguishing marks of Fascism; but some Fascist movements are not antisemitic. Learned controversies, reverberating for years on end in American magazines, have not even been able to determine whether or not Fascism is a form of capitalism. But still, when we apply the term ‘Fascism’ to Germany or Japan or Mussolini's Italy, we know broadly what we mean.\n\nSome have argued that the terms \"fascism\" and \"fascist\" have become hopelessly vague since the World War II period, and that today it is little more than a pejorative used by supporters of various political views to insult their opponents. The word \"fascist\" is sometimes used to denigrate people, institutions, or groups that would not describe themselves as ideologically fascist, and that may not fall within the formal definition of the word. As a political epithet, \"fascist\" has been used in an anti-authoritarian sense to emphasize the common ideology of governmental suppression of individual freedom. In this sense, the word \"fascist\" is intended to mean oppressive, intolerant, chauvinist, genocidal, dictatorial, racist, or aggressive. George Orwell wrote in 1944:\n...the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else ... Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathisers, almost any English person would accept ‘bully’ as a synonym for ‘Fascist’. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come.\n\nAnarcho-capitalist authors Linda and Morris Tannehill claim in their 1970 self-published work \"The Market for Liberty\" that \"Fascism is a system in which the government leaves nominal ownership of the means of production in the hands of private individuals but exercises control by means of regulatory legislation and reaps most of the profit by means of heavy taxation. In effect, fascism is simply a more subtle form of government ownership than is socialism\".\n\n\n\n"}

It came into fashion in 16th century English drama in interludes featuring \"personifications of abstract virtues and vices who contend in ways which foreshadow and moralize the fortunes of the play's characters\".\n\nThere are examples in \"Gorboduc\" (1561) throughout which dumbshow plays a major part, and in Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (1580s), George Peele's \"The Battle of Alcazar\" (1594) and \"The Old Wives' Tale\" (1595), Robert Greene's \"Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay\" (1594) and the anonymous \"A Warning for Fair Women\" (1599). Shakespeare used dumbshow in \"Hamlet,\" for the play within a play staged by Prince Hamlet and the players for King Claudius. That, like Revenge's dumbshow in \"The Spanish Tragedy\", suggests by mime the action soon to take place in the main spoken drama. In Dobson's view the dumbshow was becoming old-fashioned by Shakespeare's time, and the playwright's most elaborate dumbshows are in \"Pericles\", a play intentionally constructed in \"a mock-medieval dramatic idiom\". In the 17th century, dumbshow survived as an element of the courtly masque, and in the Jacobean tragedies of Webster and Middleton dumbshows are featured in masque-within-the-play episodes.\n\nFrom the 1630s the dumbshow no longer featured in mainstream British drama, but it resurfaced in harlequinades, pantomimes and melodramas in the 19th century. Thomas Holcroft introduced a dumb character in his play \"A Tale of Mystery\" (1802), and the device of using a mute to convey essential facts by dumbshow became a regular feature of melodramas. In his \"Dictionary of Literary Terms\" (first published in 1977), J. A. Cuddon lists 19th century plays with the titles \"The Dumb Boy\" (1821), \"The Dumb Brigand\" (1832), \"The Dumb Recruit\" (1840), \"The Dumb Driver\" (1849) and \"The Dumb Sailor\" (1854). \n\nCuddon notes three 20th century instances of dumbshow in André Obey's \"Le Viol de Lucrece\" (1931), Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" (1953) and Tom Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" (1966).\n"}

In the development of Marathi literature, Eknath is seen as a bridge between his predecessors—Dnyaneshwar and Namdev—and the later Tukaram and Ramdas.\n\nThe precise dates of his life are uncertain but it is traditionally held that Eknath lived during the last three-quarters of the sixteenth-century CE. Legend also says that he was born to a Marathi Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin family that worshiped Ekvira as their family deity at Paithan, that his parents died while he was young and that he was then raised by his grandfather, Bhanudas, a sant also revered by the Varkari sect. Some sources say that Bhanudas was his great-grandfather. It is possible, but not certain, that Eknath's guru, Janardan, was a Sufi.\n\nOnce, Eknath, was invited by a Mahar to eat at his house. Eknath accepted, quoting a verse from the Bhagavata Purana – \"A dog-eating outcaste, who has made an offering to God of his mind, his words, his actions, his property and his very life, is to be considered far superior to a Brahman, who, although gifted with the twelve characteristics of a Brahman, has turned away from the feet of God. The former purifies his whole family, not so the latter puffed up with pride\". The Brahmins were enraged when the heard him quoting this. Eknath submitted himself to the penance imposed by them. However, he accepted the invitation again. This time, he was (according to a legend) saved by the God Vitthal from being ostracized. According to this legend, Vitthal took the form of Eknath and went to the Mahar's house instead of him.\n\nHe wrote a variation of the \"Bhagavata Purana\" which is known as the \"Eknathi Bhagavata\", and a variation of the \"Ramayana\" which is known as the \"Bhavarth Ramayan\". Eknath wrote \"Rukmini Swayamwar\" \"Hastamalak\", which was comprised 764 \"owees\" and based on a 14-shlok Sanskrit hymn with the same name by Shankaracharya.\n\nHis other works were the \"Shukashtak\" (447 \"owees\"), the \"Swatma-Sukha\" (510 \"owees\"), the \"Ananda-Lahari\" (154 \"owees\"), the \"Chiranjeewa-Pad\" (42 \"owees\"), the \"Geeta-Sar\", and the \"Prahlad-Wijaya\".

{"id": "10302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10302", "title": "Ethnologue", "text": "Ethnologue\n\nEthnologue: Languages of the World is an annual reference publication in print and online that provides statistics and other information on the living languages of the world. It was first issued in 1951, and is now published annually by SIL International, a U.S.-based, worldwide, Christian non-profit organization. SIL's main purpose is to study, develop and document languages to promote literacy and for religious purposes. \n\nAs of 2018, \"Ethnologue\" contains web-based information on 7,097 languages in its 21st edition, including the number of speakers, locations, dialects, linguistic affiliations, autonyms, availability of the Bible in each language and dialect described, a cursory description of revitalization efforts where reported, and an estimate of language viability using the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS).\n\n\"Ethnologue\" has been published by SIL International (formerly known as the Summer Institute of Linguistics), a Christian linguistic service organization with an international office in Dallas, Texas. \nThe organization studies numerous minority languages to facilitate language development, and to work with speakers of such language communities in translating portions of the Bible into their languages.\nThe determination of what characteristics define a single language depends upon sociolinguistic evaluation by various scholars; as the preface to \"Ethnologue\" states, \"Not all scholars share the same set of criteria for what constitutes a 'language' and what features define a 'dialect'.\" \"Ethnologue\" follows general linguistic criteria, which are based primarily on mutual intelligibility. Shared language intelligibility features are complex, and usually include etymological and grammatical evidence that is agreed upon by experts.\n\nIn addition to choosing a primary name for a language, \"Ethnologue\" provides listings of the name(s) for the language and any dialects that are used by its speakers, government, foreigners and neighbors. Also included are any names that have been commonly referenced historically, regardless of whether a name is considered official, politically correct or offensive; this allows more complete historic research to be done. These lists of names are not necessarily complete.\n\nIn 1984, \"Ethnologue\" released a three-letter coding system, called an 'SIL code', to identify each language that it described. This set of codes significantly exceeded the scope of other standards, e.g. ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2. The 14th edition, published in 2000, included 7,148 language codes.\n\nIn 2002, \"Ethnologue\" was asked to work with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to integrate its codes into a draft international standard. The 15th edition of \"Ethnologue\" was the first edition to use this standard, called ISO 639-3. This standard is now administered separately from Ethnologue (though still by SIL according to rules established by ISO, and since then \"Ethnologue\" relies on the standard to determine what is listed as a language). In only one case, \"Ethnologue\" and the ISO standards treat languages slightly differently. ISO 639-3 considers Akan to be a macrolanguage consisting of two distinct languages, Twi and Fante, whereas \"Ethnologue\" considers Twi and Fante to be dialects of a single language (Akan), since they are mutually intelligible. This anomaly resulted because the ISO 639-2 standard has separate codes for Twi and Fante, which have separate literary traditions, and all 639-2 codes for individual languages are automatically part of 639–3, even though 639-3 would not normally assign them separate codes.\n\nIn 2014, with the 17th edition, \"Ethnologue\" introduced a numerical code for language status using a framework called EGIDS (Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale), an elaboration of Fishman's GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale). It ranks a language from 0 for an international language to 10 for an extinct language, i.e. a language with which no-one retains a sense of ethnic identity.\n\nIn December 2015, \"Ethnologue\" launched a metered paywall; users in high-income countries who want to refer to more than seven pages of data per month must buy a paid subscription.\n\nAs of 2017, \"Ethnologue\"'s 20th edition described 237 language families including 86 language isolates and six typological categories, namely sign languages, creoles, pidgins, mixed languages, constructed languages, and as yet unclassified languages.\n\nIn 1986, William Bright, then editor of the journal \"Language\", wrote of \"Ethnologue\" that it \"is indispensable for any reference shelf on the languages of the world\". In 2008 in the same journal, Lyle Campbell and Verónica Grondona said: \"Ethnologue\"...has become the standard reference, and its usefulness is hard to overestimate.\"\n\nIn 2015, Harald Hammarström, an editor of \"Glottolog\", criticized the publication for frequently lacking citations and failing to articulate clear principles of language classification and identification. However, he concluded that, on balance, \"\"Ethnologue\" is an impressively comprehensive catalogue of world languages, and it is far superior to anything else produced prior to 2009.\"\n\nStarting with the 17th edition, \"Ethnologue\" has been published every year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "169472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169472", "title": "Frontinus", "text": "Frontinus\n\nSextus Julius Frontinus (c. 40 – 103 AD) was a prominent Roman civil engineer, author, and politician of the late 1st century AD. He was a successful general under Domitian, commanding forces in Roman Britain, and on the Rhine and Danube frontiers. A \"novus homo\", he was consul three times. Frontinus ably discharged several important administrative duties for Nerva and Trajan. However, he is best known to the post-Classical world as an author of technical treatises, especially \"De aquaeductu\", dealing with the aqueducts of Rome.\n\nIn AD 70, Frontinus participated in the suppression of the Rhineland revolt, and later recorded that he received the surrender of 70,000 Lingones. Between that date and being appointed governor of Britain to succeed Quintus Petillius Cerialis a few years later, Frontinus was appointed suffect consul. While governor of Britain, he subjugated the Silures of South Wales and is thought to have likewise campaigned against the Brigantes. He was succeeded by Gnaeus Julius Agricola, the father-in-law of the famous historian Tacitus, in 77. Birley believes it \"is fair to speculate\" that Frontinus was with Domitian during the German campaign of 83. An inscription at Hieropolis in Phrygia, as well as a number of coins of Smyrna, attests that he was proconsul of Asia in AD 86.\n\nIn 97, he was appointed \"curator aquarum\" (supervisor of the aqueducts) by the emperor Nerva, an office only conferred upon persons of very high standing. He was also a member of the College of Augurs. In this capacity, he followed another distinguished Roman statesman, Agrippa, the friend, ally and son-in-law of Augustus, who organised in 34 BC a campaign of public repairs and improvements, including renovation of the aqueduct Aqua Marcia and an extension of its pipes to cover more of the city.\n\nThe following year Frontinus held a second consulship as suffect in February, with Trajan as his colleague, and two years later he was made \"consul ordinarius\" with Trajan. Birley notes, \"This exceptional honour underlines the high regard in which he [Frontinus] was held, and suggests, further, that Trajan had a debt to repay.\" He died in 103 or 104, a date based on Pliny the Younger writing to his friends that he was elected to the college of augurs to fill the vacancy Frontinus' death had created.\n\nDue to a lack of either a \"titulus honorarius\" or \"sepulcralis\", there is no outline of Frontinus' life, the names of his parents, or of his wife. Some details can be inferred from chance mentions: He is thought to be of Narbonese origins, and originally of the equestrian class. From the nomenclature of the name of Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus (consul c. 84), it is likely Frontinus had a sister, who was the other's mother. Frontinus had at least one daughter, the wife of Quintus Sosius Senecio (cos. 99, II 107) and mother of Sosia Polla.\n\nFrontinus's chief work is \"De aquaeductu\", in two books, an official report to the emperor on the state of the aqueducts of Rome. It presents a history and description of the water-supply of Rome, including the laws relating to its use and maintenance. He provides the history, sizes and discharge rates of all of the nine aqueducts of Rome at the time at which he was writing at the turn of the 1st century AD: the Aqua Marcia, Aqua Appia, Aqua Alsietina, Aqua Tepula, Anio Vetus, Anio Novus, Aqua Virgo, Aqua Claudia and Aqua Augusta. Frontinus describes the quality of water delivered by each, mainly depending on their source, be it river, lake, or spring.\n\nOne of the first jobs he undertook when he was appointed water commissioner was to prepare maps of the system so that he could assess their condition before undertaking their maintenance. He says that many had been neglected and were not working at their full capacity. He was especially concerned by diversion of the supply by unscrupulous farmers and tradesmen, among many others. They would insert pipes into the channel of the aqueducts to tap the supply. He, therefore, made a meticulous survey of the intake and the supply of each line, and then investigated the discrepancies. Lead pipe stamps bearing the name of the owner were also used to prevent such water theft. He was well aware of the seminal work \"De Architectura\" by Vitruvius, which mentions aqueduct construction and maintenance published in the previous century; Frontinus refers to the possible influence of Vitruvius on the plumbers.\n\nDistribution of the water depended in a complex way on its height entering the city, the quality of the water, and its rate of discharge. Thus, poor-quality water would be sent for irrigation, gardens, or flushing, while only the best would be reserved for drinking water. Intermediate-quality water would be used for the many baths and fountains. However, Frontinus criticized the practice of mixing supplies from different sources, and one of his first decisions was to separate the waters from each system.\n\nHe was very concerned by leaks in the system, especially those in the underground conduits, which were difficult to locate and mend, a problem still faced by water engineers today. The aqueducts above ground needed care to ensure that the masonry was kept in good condition, especially those running on arched superstructures. It was, he said, essential to keep trees at a distance so that their roots would not damage the structures. He reviewed the existing law governing the state aqueducts, as well as the need for enforcement of those statutes.\n\nFrontinus also wrote a theoretical treatise on military science, which is lost. His extant work on military matters, the \"Stratagems\" (Latin: \"Strategemata\"), is a collection of examples of military stratagems from Greek and Roman history, for the use of generals. He draws on his own experience as a general in Germania under Domitian, but similarities between the anecdotes he records and versions of other Roman authors like Valerius Maximus and Livy suggest that he drew mainly on literary sources. The authenticity of the fourth book has been challenged.\nOne example he gives of control of river water during a siege reads:\n\n\nHe appears as a fictionalised character in the Marcus Didius Falco novels \"The Silver Pigs\", \"Shadows in Bronze\", \"Three Hands in the Fountain\", and \"The Jupiter Myth\". He also appears as a character in The Centurions novels \"Barbarian Princess\" and \"The Emperor's Games\".\n\n\n"}

These theories explain how linguistic utterances are shaped, based on the goals and knowledge of natural language users. In doing so, it contrasts with Chomskyan transformational grammar. Functional discourse grammar has been developed as a successor to functional grammar, attempting to be more psychologically and pragmatically adequate than functional grammar.\n\nThe top-level unit of analysis in functional discourse grammar is the discourse move, not the sentence or the clause. This is a principle that sets functional discourse grammar apart from many other linguistic theories, including its predecessor functional grammar.\n\nFunctional grammar (FG) is a model of grammar motivated by functions. The model was originally developed by Simon C. Dik at the University of Amsterdam in the 1970s, and has undergone several revisions since then. The latest standard version under the original name is laid out in the 1997 edition, published shortly after Dik's death. The latest version features the expansion of the model with a pragmatic/interpersonal module by Kees Hengeveld and Lachlan Mackenzie. This has led to a renaming of the theory to functional discourse grammar. This type of grammar is quite distinct from systemic functional grammar as developed by Michael Halliday and many other linguists since the 1970s.\n\nThe notion of \"function\" in FG generalizes the standard distinction of grammatical functions such as subject and object. Constituents (parts of speech) of a linguistic utterance are assigned three types or levels of functions:\n\n\nThere are a number of principles that guide the analysis of natural language utterances according to functional discourse grammar.\n\nFunctional discourse grammar explains the phonology, morphosyntax, pragmatics and semantics in one linguistic theory. According to functional discourse grammar, linguistic utterances are built top-down in this order by deciding upon:\n\nAccording to functional discourse grammar, four components are involved in building up an utterance:\n\nThe grammatical component consists of four levels:\n\nThis example analyzes the utterance \"I can't find the red pan. It is not in its usual place.\" according to functional discourse grammar at the interpersonal level.\n\nAt the interpersonal level, this utterance is one discourse move, which consists of two discourse acts, one corresponding to \"I can't find the red pan.\" and another corresponding to \"It is not in its usual place.\"\n\nSimilar analysis, decomposing the utterance into progressively smaller units, is possible at the other levels of the grammatical component.\n\n\n"}

A general contractor is responsible for the overall coordination of a project.\nA general contractor must first assess the project-specific documents (referred to as bid, proposal or tender documents). In the case of renovations, a site visit is required to get a better understanding of the project. Depending on the project delivery method, the contractor will submit a fixed price proposal or bid, cost plus price or an estimate. The general contractor considers the cost of home office overhead, general conditions, materials, and equipment as well as the cost of labor to provide the owner with a price for the project.\n\nContract documents include drawings, project manual (including general, supplementary or special conditions and specifications), addendum or modifications issued prior to proposal/ bidding ad prepared by a design professional such as an architect. The general contractor may be the construction manager or construction manager at high risk.\n\nA general contractor is responsible for providing all of the material, labor, equipment (such as engineering vehicles and tools) and services necessary for the construction of the project. The general contractor hires specialized subcontractors to perform all or portions of the construction work.\n\nThe general contractor is also responsible for the quality of all work performed by any and all subcontractors. The general contractor's number one priority is safety on the jobsite.\n\nResponsibilities may include applying for building permits, advising the person they are hired by, securing the property, providing temporary utilities on site, managing personnel on site, providing site surveying and engineering, disposing or recycling of construction waste, monitoring schedules, and cash flows, and maintaining accurate records.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some British Commonwealth countries, the term 'general contractor' was gradually superseded by 'main contractor' during the early twentieth century. This was the term used by major professional, trade, and consumer organizations when issuing contracts for construction work, and thus the term 'general contractor' fell out of use except in large organizations where the main contractor is the top manager and a general contractor shares responsibilities with professional contractors.\n\nGeneral contractors who conduct work for government agencies are often referred to as \"prime contractors\". This terms is also used in contexts where the customer's immediate contractor is permitted to sub-contract or circumstances are likely to involve sub-contracting to specialist operators e.g. in various public services. \n\nLicensing requirements to work legally on construction projects vary from locale to locale. In the United States, it is the states' responsibility to define these requirements: for example, in the state of California, the requirements are stated as follows:\n\nIn every state (that requires a license), a surety bond is required as part of the licensing process. Not all states require General Contractor licenses - these include Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, among others.\n\nThere are no set educational qualifications to become a general contractor. Some general contractors obtain bachelor's degrees in construction science, building science, surveying, construction safety, or other disciplines.\n\nGeneral contractors often start out as construction workers. While gaining work experience, they learn about different aspects of construction, including masonry, carpentry, framing, and plumbing. Aspiring general contractors communicate with subcontractors and may learn the management skills they need to run their own company.\n\nExperience in the construction industry as well as references from customers, business partners, or former employers are demanded. Some jurisdictions require candidates to provide proof of financing to own their own general contracting firm.\n\nGeneral contractors often run their own business. They hire subcontractors to complete specialized construction work and may manage a team of plumbers, electricians, masons, carpenters, iron workers, and other specialists. General contractors build their business by networking with potential clients, buying basic construction tools, and ensuring that their subcontractors complete high-quality work. General contractors don't usually complete much construction work themselves, but they need to be familiar with construction techniques so they can manage workers effectively.\n\nBusinesses may choose to hire contractors over employees for a variety of reasons. For legal reasons it can be easier to hire and to release a contractor compared to a permanent employee. Additionally, business owners may choose to hire contractors because of economic uncertainty or other factors that make hiring employees impractical. Other reasons include access to specialist skills, flexible hiring and firing, and lower costs.\n\nA property owner or real estate developer develops a program of their needs and select a site (often with an architect). The architect assembles a design team of consulting engineers and other experts to design the building and specify the building systems. Today contractors frequently participate on the design team by providing pre-design services such as providing estimations of the budget and scheduling requirements to improve the economy of the project. In other cases the general contractor is hired at the close of the design phase. The owner, architect, and general contractor work closely together to meet deadlines and budget. The general contractor works with subcontractors to ensure quality standards.\n\n"}
{"id": "42329379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42329379", "title": "German honorifics", "text": "German honorifics\n\n\"Honorifics\" are words that connote esteem or respect when used in addressing or referring to a person. In the German language, honorifics distinguish people by age, sex, profession, academic achievement, and rank. In the past, a distinction was also made between married and unmarried women.\n\nLike many languages, German has pronouns for both familiar (used with family members, intimate friends, and children) and polite forms of address. The polite equivalent of \"you\" is \"Sie.\" Grammatically speaking, this is the 3rd-person-plural form, and, as a subject of a sentence, it always takes the 3rd-person-plural forms of verbs and possessive adjective/ pronouns, even when talking to only one person. (Familiar pronouns have singular and plural forms.) Honorific pronouns are always capitalized except for the polite reflexive pronoun \"sich.\" In letters, e-mails, and other texts in which the reader is directly addressed, familiar pronouns may be capitalized or not. In schoolbooks, the pronouns usually remain lowercased.\n\nDeclension of the polite personal pronoun \"\"Sie\":\n\nNominative case (= Accusative case): \"Sie\"\n\nGenitive case: \"Ihrer\"\n\nDative case: \"Ihnen\"\n\nDeclension of polite possessive adjectives:\n\nObsolete forms of honorific addresses:\n\nIn former times, the 2nd person plural (\"Ihr\" ; like the French « \"vous\" ») or the 3rd person singular (\"Er\" He, \"Sie\"\" She) and their corresponding possessive adjectives and verb forms were used. The 3rd person plural as polite form of address as it is used today became standard during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nFor more details about German grammar, see the entries about the German language.\n\n\nUsing \"Herr\" for very young misters, certainly those below the age of 16, is rather awkward and often avoided (except in letters from the state's bureaucracy) by using the first name, or first name and last name. There used to be a direct equivalent to \"Fräulein\", viz., \"Junker\" (equivalent to Master), but this word is now only used in describing a specific class (which properly speaking did not consist of \"junkers\" in this sense at all, but of \"Herren\") and in the term \"Fahnenjunker\" (\"officer candidate 3rd class\"), reflecting the tradition that only officers are \"Herren\" (though now used together with \"Herr\", see below under military). Also, it never lost the touch of describing exclusively those of higher class, which was originally true of all the four mentioned above but has been lost by all of them.\n\nNote that almost all other honorifics will be combined with a \"Herr\" or \"Frau\" respectively (and almost never with a \"Fräulein\"); the contrary shall be noted as exceptions in the following.\n\nAll clergy and ministers are usually called \"Herr\" (or Protestants also: \"Frau\") plus the title of their office, e. g., \"Herr Pfarrer\". Adjectival predicates are only used for Roman Catholic clergy, and then in the following order:\n\n\nWhether Monsignors of the first degree (that is, Chaplains of His Holiness) are \"hochwürdigst\" or \"hochwürdig\" is a borderline case. The predicate \"hochwürdigst\" is sometimes also extended to other priests of certain high positions (say, cathedral capitulars), but never for parish priests or for deans.\n\nAll these predicates are in increasingly sparing use (except for the first, and except for \"Excellency\" as applied to the nuncio), but especially \"Seine Gnaden\" (which dates from a time when not all bishops were accorded the style \"Excellency\" then considered higher) and \"hochehrwürdig\" and \"wohlehrwürdig\" (which tend to be replaced by a simple \"ehrwürdig\"), followed by \"Excellency\" at least as far as auxiliary bishops are concerned. It is good style, though, to use them at least in all places where layfolk would be addressed as \"sehr geehrte\" (which they replace), such as at the beginning of letters, speeches and so forth. The oft-seen abbreviation \"H. H.\" (e. g. in obituaries) means \"hochwürdigster Herr\".\n\nIt is incorrect to address an auxiliary bishop as \"Herr Weihbischof\"; he must be called \"Herr Bischof\". Cardinals are always \"Herr Kardinal\" (or more formally \"Seine/Euer Eminenz\"), never, for instance, \"Herr Erzbischof\" even if they are diocesan archbishops and are addressed as such.\n\nThe literal translation of \"Monsignor\" is \"Monsignore\" (using the Italian form), but it is only usually used for Monsignors of the first degree (Chaplains of His Holiness), not for prelates as in English, or for bishops as in Italian. If used, protocol demands to leave away the usual \"Herr\" (to avoid the meaning \"Lord Mylord\"), but this is as uncommon in German that the incorrect phrase \"Herr Monsignore\" can often be heard.\n\nHigher prelates are addressed \"Herr Prälat\" (not, usually, \"Herr Protonotar\"), or possibly with their office (if it is not that of a Cathedral capitular without further distinction, in which case the title of prelate is preferred.)\n\nAbbots are addressed \"Herr Abt\" or \"Vater Abt\" (\"Father Abbot\"), abbesses \"Frau Äbtissin\" or \"Mutter Äbtissin\" (\"Mother Abbess\"). (The \"Father\" and \"Mother\" versions are one of the few cases where \"Herr\" or \"Frau\" falls away.) Other male religious are called \"Pater\" (\"Father\", but in Latin) if priests and \"Frater\" (\"Brother\", but also in Latin) if not, sometimes together with the surname, sometimes also with the first name (though Canons Regular are called \"Herr\" rather than Pater or Frater). Female religious are called \"Schwester\" (\"Sister\", but this time in German). This is not used together with both Herr/Frau and their name, though in the address, it is quite common to address a religious priest who does pastoral work in a parish orally as \"Herr Pater\" (\"Mr. Father\").\n\n- The office of \"Priester\" (priest) taken simply is nb. \"never\" used as a title (there is \"Herr Diakon\" and \"Herr Bischof\" but no \"Herr Priester\"). In the usually brief period where a secular priest has no office that could be used in addressing him, the phrase \"Herr Neupriester\" (\"Mr. New Priest\") is used; after retirement, the title \"Pfarrer\" (parish priest, pastor) can be kept if held at some point in their life. It is also quite common to address such priests with their academic rank, if they have some (\"[hochwürdiger] Herr Dr. Lastname\", for a doctor), or their civil-servant rank if they have some (\"[hochwürdiger] Herr Oberstudienrat\", literally something like \"Rev. Mr. Teacher-first-class\", for a priest who serves as teacher of religion at a state school). Professors of theology are always addressed by their academic function (except, possibly, if prelates, which usually, though of similar eminence, they aren't).\n\nParochial vicars usually have the honorific title \"Kaplan\" (chaplain), while \"actual\" chaplains as a rule have the in this case honorific title \"Pfarrer\" (\"parish priest\").\n\nThe traditional honorifics for nobility are, in descending order,\n\nThe last one is now completely obsolete, as is the incorrect practice of elevating bourgeois notables to \"Hochwohlgeboren\" (which emerged in the last years of the German monarchies to give expression to the importance of the bourgeoisie in a society that was \"in its formalities\" still pre-Industrial Revolution). But also \"Erlaucht\", \"Hochgeboren\", \"Hochwohlgeboren\" are increasingly rare (and some make a point of not attaching any such predicate unless to sovereigns of non-German states). Austrian (but not German) nobility is forbidden to attach honorifics to themselves or demand them (but may attach them to family members).\n\nThe equivalent of a Baron is called \"Freiherr\" (fem. \"Freifrau\", fem. unmarried \"Freifräulein\", which is rare, or its more usual abbreviation \"Freiin\"), though some \"Barone\" exist with foreign (e. g. Russian) titles. Nevertheless, in address they are usually called \"Baron\", \"Baronin\", and \"Baroneß\". It is considered incorrect to attach \"Herr, Frau, Fräulein\" to \"Baron\" and so forth, except if the Baron in question is one's actual superior, though this appears often nevertheless. It certainly is incorrect to speak of \"Herr Freiherr\" and so forth, seeing that this is a doubling, so sometimes the phrase \"[sehr geehrter] Freiherr von [e. g.] Sonstwoher\" is used (given that \"Freiherr\" is unquestionably part of the name of the person in Germany - not in Austria - while calling him \"Baron\" means treating him as nobility).\n\nIt is likewise considered incorrect to attach \"Herr, Frau, Fräulein\" to Counts (m. \"Graf\", fem. \"Gräfin\", fem. unmarried \"Komteß\"), unless the Count in question is one's actual superior, though again this still appears often\n\n\n\"Doktor\" and \"Magistra\" are the only honorifics (other than those of lower nobility) which can be combined not only with \"Frau\" but also with \"Fräulein\" (subject to the general caveats concerning the use of \"Fräulein\"). However, a practicioning female physician or attorney would be \"Frau Doktor\" if holding a doctorate; a \"Fräulein Doktor\" suggests an unmarried woman with a doctorate in an academic (or retired) position.\n\nThe otherwise outdated use of calling people with \"Herr\" and their functions (when they are not ranks of any kind) is in full vigour as far as courtrooms are concerned, where the participants will all the time be addressed as \"Herr Angeklagter\" (\"Mr. Defendant\"), \"Herr Verteidiger\" (\"Mr. Defending Counsel\"), \"Herr Zeuge\" (\"Mr. Witness\"), \"Herr Kläger\" (\"Mr. Plaintiff\") and so forth. Judges are \"Herr Richter\", \"Herr Vorsitzender\", \"Herr Vizepräsident\" or \"Herr Präsident\" (depending on their rank), similarly the public prosecutors (usually \"Herr Staatsanwalt\").\n\nThe general address for soldiers is \"Herr\" (or nowadays \"Frau\") plus their military rank, e. g., \"Herr Leutnant\". If needed for distinction, the last name can be attached. Subordinates can alternatively be called with rank plus last-name. For soldiers who know each other, for \"Mannschaften\" (enlisted personnel not NCOs) among themselves, and also for an officer from the same unit to an enlisted soldier whom he knows personally, the rank can fall away except if the subordinate addresses the superior, but \"Herr\" is \"never\" attached to the last-name simply.\n\nSuperiors can alternatively call their enlisted subordinates by their function (e. g. \"Richtschütze\" \"gunner\", \"Kraftfahrer\" \"motorist\", \"Truppführer\" \"assistant squad leader\", and so forth).\n\nThe NVA used \"Genosse\" (\"Comrade\") instead of \"Herr\". In the Imperial Army, the style of \"Excellency\" was appropriate for some high-ranking generals.\n\nA direct equivalent to the frequent anglophone use of \"Sir\" does not exist.\n\nCivil servants (\"Beamten\") used to be called with \"Herr\" or \"Frau\" plus their rank (for their respective ranks, see the tables at Beamter). This is in full vigour for police-officers (with the now unused rank \"Wachtmeister\" stepping in if the precise rank is not known and the addresser is not familiar with the shoulder strap), but otherwise somewhat outdating.\n\nAs teachers on public schools are, as a rule, civil servants (and on Church schools often receive a similar status), this is likewise true for teachers, with the exception that for teachers not the headmaster, it is perhaps even a bit more outdating to use their rank than for other civil servants.\n\nIt used to be the case that the name of professions was used as a honorific, together with \"Herr\" (or \"Frau\"), e. g. \"Herr Schriftsteller\" (\"Mr. Professional Writer\"), \"Herr Installateur\" (\"Mr. Plumber\") and so forth. This is generally outdated.\n\nThough there is a professional qualification called \"Meister\" (\"master craftsman\"), and there is also an outdated honorific called \"Meister\" (in this case roughly equivalent to \"goodman\"; in use, when \"Herr\" was only applied to high-ranking persons, for the non-dependent men below them), this was never a honorific specifically in use for master craftsmen.\n\nIn \"Austria\" - and in monarchical times also in Germany - the Head of State can give certain titles to people of notable achievements in their profession (and, if not for civil servants, usually considerable donations to public welfare). These, again, are usually used with \"Herr\" and \"Frau\" respectively.\n\nA well-known example is the \"Kommerzialrat\" (Prussia: \"Kommerzienrat\") (\"Commercial Counsellor [implied: to the Court]), which denotes an entitled businessman. In the monarchies, there also was an \"augmented\" form of that, in this case \"Geheimer Kommerzialrat\", generally received by adding the adjective \"Geheim\" (see Geheimrat). This literally means \"Privy (Commercial, etc.) Councillor\" and is roughly the equivalent of a person knighted for their (in this case commercial) achievements.\n\nGermany generally has not kept the practice, except for the fine arts (Kammersänger, Staatsschauspieler and so forth). People who had received a title under the monarchies usually retained them until their death.\n\nOn the other hand, the distinction \"Hoflieferant\" (\"Court supplier\") was not strictly speaking a honorific (though often used as such), but implied the actual function of someone supplying a Court in at least a marginal rôle with some (high-quality) goods. \"Hoflieferant\" is now still attached to the \"companies\" who had received it under the monarchies, but no longer as previously to their \"proprietors in person\" (if they, as now always the case, came into that position later, whether by inheriting or buying).\n"}

Impiety is often closely associated with sacrilege, though it is not necessarily a physical action. Impiety cannot be associated with a cult, as it implies a larger belief system was disrespected. One of the Pagan objections to Christianity was that, unlike other mystery religions, early Christians refused to cast a pinch of incense before the images of the gods, an impious act in their eyes. Impiety in ancient civilizations was a civic concern, rather than religious. It was believed that impious actions such as disrespect towards sacred objects or priests could bring down the wrath of the gods. \n\nThe issue of impiety in antiquity is very controversial because of the anecdotal nature of extant sources. A number of Athenian men, including Alcibiades, were sentenced to death for impiety in 415 BC, most of whom fled Athens before execution (Andocides was later charged in 400 or 399 BC in reference to these events). Most famously, the philosopher Socrates was executed for impiety (as well as corrupting Athenian youth) in 399 BC. An Athenian philosopher Anaxagoras taught that the sun and the stars were fiery stones whose heat we did not feel because of their distance, and was allegedly accused of impiety in Athens. Diagoras of Melos was reportedly accused of atheism and had to flee Athens after being charged with impiety for revealing the content of the Eleusinian mysteries to the uninitiated. Philosophers Aristotle and Theophrastus might have been accused of impiety as well.\n\n"}

It is oftentimes used by a post office system in transporting these different grades of mail. The \"mailbag\" is carried by some means of transporting like a mail carrier, animal (\"e.g.\", mule, horse), or a mobile post office. Letters and printed material delivered by mail in the seventeen-hundreds were carried by horse in a saddle bag. There are several different types of \"mailbags\" for different purposes (\"e.g.\", transporting mail to and from post offices, delivering mail to businesses and homes. These different styles of mailbags depend on its size and purpose. It can range from \"a large bag used for transporting mail on a truck, plane, etc.\" to a simple \"postbag\" used by a mail carrier to deliver mail.\n\nThe idea of having \"mail bags\" on board ships traveling between Jamaica and Great Britain was established as early as 1780. The name of the ship carrying a letter was put on the corner of the letter so that it would be put into the proper \"mail bag\" for the destination intended.\n\nA \"mailbag\" throughout the United States history has been called various names depending on its form and function at the time, some of which are now obsolete. Among these names are mail sack, mail satchel, mail pouch, catcher pouch, mochila, and portmanteau.\n\nPrivate Mail Bags or so-called \"Locked Bags\" are a worldwide solution for specialized mail delivery to a single location. Like PO Box addresses, Private Mail Bag addresses omit the name of the building and street, and include only the number allocated to the user. Private Mail Bag addresses are often used in countries in Africa where there may be no street delivery service. In Europe and North America, where street delivery is more commonplace, large users may be allocated their own postal codes, and consequently need only use their physical address in correspondence; the postal code implies that the recipient receives mail by caller service. Private mail bags may be in lieu of a Post Office Box, but sometimes can go so far as to have an individualized corporate zip code.\n\nThe U.S. National Postal Museum says that any bag that carries mail (\"e.g.\", letters, magazines, advertisement brochures, packages) is defined as a \"Mailbag\". A \" mailbag \" is called a \"postbag\" in England. The form and structure of mailbags has implications for fatigue and industrial injuries to mail carriers.\n\nA mail sack is a lower security class mailbag used to carry second-class, third-class, and fourth-class mail. It does not have a locking mechanism with it.\n\nA mail satchel is a device letter carriers use over-the-shoulder for assisting the delivery of personal mail to businesses and homes.\n\nA mail pouch is a strong material (\"e.g.\", canvas) mail bag designed to lock at the top to prevent access into the bag. They are usually used for transporting First-class and registered mail to and from different post offices. Mail pouches also carry military domestic and military airmail.\n\nA catcher pouch was a mail bag used only by the Railway Post Office in exchanging mail when the train did not stop at the town. It was most popular in the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century.\n\nA mochila was a removable lightweight leather cover put over a horse saddle for carrying mail and was used by the Pony Express.\n\nA portmanteau was a traveling suitcase used as a mailbag in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to carry both letters and newspapers. When it opened it had two different compartments, one for letters and the other for newspapers.\n\n\n\n"}

At the age of seven he went to a village school, where all subjects were taught in Russian. In 1920, he entered a pedagogical technical school. In 1921, he entered Komsomol. In 1930, he graduated from history faculty of Azerbaijan University, and from 1936-1938, studied at scenario faculty of the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow.\n\nMehdi Huseyn wrote his first \"Sheering of sheep\" narrative in the last year at the secondary school, and it was published in 1926, in Sharg Gadini magazine (\"Woman of the East\"). Since then creativity of the writer began. His earlier stories describe an Azerbaijani village of post-revolutionary years and a struggle against patriarchal and feudal relations. His works dedicated to the Civil war are stories in \"Khaver\" and \"Spring floods\" collections written in 1926-1932, and \"Flood\" novel (1936).

The broad management scope includes sub-suppliers, suppliers, internal information and funds flow.\n\nA supply is the procurement, distribution, maintenance while in storage and salvage of supplies, including the determination of kind and quantity of supplies. The producer phase of a military supply extends from determination of procurement schedules to acceptance of finished supplies by the military services. The consumer phase of a military supply extends from receipt of finished supplies by the military services, through issue for use or consumption.\n\nThe supply chain is the linked activities associated with providing material from a raw material stage to an end user as a finished good. Supply control\nis the process by which an item of supply is controlled within the supply system, including requisitioning, receipt, storage, stock control, shipment, disposition, identification, and accounting. The supply point is a location where supplies, services and materials are located and issued. These locations are temporary and mobile, normally being occupied for up to 72 hours.\n\nMilitary logistics is the science of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of armed forces. In its most comprehensive sense, those aspects of military operations that deal with: a. design and development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of materiel; b. movement, evacuation, and hospitalization of personnel; c. acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation and disposition of facilities; and d. acquisition or furnishing of services.\n\nThe major difference between the concept of logistic management and supply chain management is the level of information gathered, processes, analysed and used for decision making. An SCM-based organization not only having concerns with its immediate clients but also handles and forecasts the factors affecting directly or indirectly their supplier or suppliers or on their client or clients. If we exclude this information part out of supply chain model then we can see the logistic management part of the business.\n\nUnlike standard supply chain management practices world-wide, some major concepts are not supported in the military domain. For example, the \"just-in-time\" (JIT) model emphasizes holding less (or no) inventory, whereas in military supply chains, due to the high costs of a stock-out (potentially placing lives in danger), keeping huge inventory is a more acceptable practice. Some examples of these are the ammunition dump and oil depot.\n\nLikewise, the military procurement process has much different criteria than the normal business procurement process. Military needs call for reliability of supply during peace and war, as compared to price and technology factors.\n\n\n"}

A sign-manual warrant may be either an executive act (for example, an appointment to an office), or an authority for affixing the Great Seal of the pertinent realm. The sign-manual is also used to give power to make and ratify treaties. \"Sign manual\", with or without hyphen, is an old term for a hand-written signature in general. It is also referred to as \"sign manual and signet\".\n\nThe royal sign-manual usually consists of the sovereign's regnal name (without number, if otherwise used), followed by the letter \"R\" for \"Rex\" (king) or \"Regina\" (queen). Thus, the signs-manual of both Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II read \"Elizabeth R\". When the British monarch was also Emperor or Empress of India, the sign manual ended with \"R I\", for \"Rex Imperator or Regina Imperatrix\" (king-emperor/queen-empress). \n\nWhen the future George IV, then the Prince of Wales, became regent on behalf of his incapacitated father, George III, the Regency Act 1811 expressly directed that the prince should sign \"George P R\", the initials standing for \"Princeps Regens\" meaning \"prince ruling\".\n\nSome letters patent are not signed by the monarch in person. Instead, the monarch signs a warrant authorizing the preparation of the letters patent (traditionally written in ceremonial calligraphy on vellum) and approving the draft text of the letters patent. Then, once the letters patent are prepared, they are sealed with the Great Seal without the need for the signature of the monarch, because royal authority for issuing the letters patent had already been given by means of the warrant. Those letters patent finish with the words \"By warrant under the King/Queen's Sign Manual,\" to signify that they do not bear the sign-manual themselves, having already been approved by warrant signed by the sovereign.\n\nOther letters patent, due to the nature of their contents (such as those that authorise the expenditure of money, or those that signify Royal Assent to Acts of Parliament), require the royal sign-manual to be affixed directly to them. Such letters patent contain, at the bottom, the words: \"By the King/Queen Him/Herself, Signed with His/Her own hand.\" The royal sign-manual is usually placed by the sovereign at the top of the document. These papers usually must be countersigned by a principal secretary of state or other responsible minister.\n\nIn some cases, the use of the sign-manual has been dispensed with and a stamp affixed \"in lieu\" thereof, as in the case of George IV, whose bodily infirmity made the act of signing difficult and painful during the last weeks of his life. The Royal Signature by Commission Act 1830 (11 Geo. IV & 1 Will. IV c. 23) was passed providing that a stamp might be affixed \"in lieu\" of the sign-manual, but the sovereign had to express his consent to each separate use of the stamp, the stamped document being attested by a confidential servant and several officers of State.\n\n\n"}

The volatilized contaminants are then either collected or thermally destroyed. A thermal desorption system therefore has two major components; the desorber itself and the offgas treatment system.\nThermal desorption is not incineration.\n\nThermal desorption first appeared as an environmental treatment technology in 1985 when it was specified in the Record of Decision for the McKin Company Superfund site within the Royal River watershed in Maine.\n\nIt is frequently referred to as \"low temp\" thermal desorption to differentiate it from high temperature incineration. An early direct fired thermal desorption project was the treatment of 8000 tons of toxaphene (a chlorinated pesticide) contaminated sandy soil at the S&S Flying Services site in Marianna Florida in 1990, with later projects exceeding 170,000 tons at the Cape Fear coal tar site in 1999. A status report from the United States Environmental Protection Agency shows that thermal desorption has been used at 69 Superfund sites through FY2000. In addition, hundreds of remediation projects have been completed using thermal desorption at non-Superfund sites.\n\nFor in-situ on-site treatment options, only incineration and stabilization have been used at more Superfund sites. Incineration suffers from poor public acceptance. Stabilization does not provide a permanent remedy, since the contaminants are still on site. Thermal desorption is a widely accepted technology that provides a permanent solution at an economically competitive cost.\n\nThe world’s first large-scale thermal desorption for treatment of mercury containing wastes was erected in Wölsau, for the remediation of the Chemical Factory Marktredwitz (founded in 1788) was considered to be the oldest in Germany. Operation commenced in October 1993 including the first optimising phase. 50,000 tons of mercury-contaminated solid wastes were treated successfully between August 1993 and June 1996. 25 metric tons of mercury had been recovered from soil and rubble. Unfortunately the Marktredwitz plant is often misunderstood in the literature as a pilot-scale plant only.\n\nNumerous desorber types are available today. Some of the more common types are listed below.\n\n\nMost indirect fired rotary systems use an inclined rotating metallic cylinder to heat the feed material. The heat transfer mechanism is usually conduction through the cylinder wall. In this type of system neither the flame nor the products of combustion can contact the feed solids or the offgas. Think of it as a rotating pipe inside a furnace with both ends sticking outside of the furnace. The cylinder for full-scale transportable systems is typically five to eight feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. With a carbon steel shell, the maximum solids temperature is around 1,000 °F, while temperatures of 1,800 °F with special alloy cylinders are attainable. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 30 to 120 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 2 to 30 tons per hour for transportable units.\n\nDirect-fired rotary desorbers have been used extensively over the years for petroleum contaminated soils and soils contaminated with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act hazardous wastes as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. A 1992 paper on treating petroleum contaminated soils estimated that between 20 and 30 contractors have 40 to 60 rotary dryer systems available. Today, it is probably closer to 6 to 10 contractors with 15 to 20 portable systems commercially available. The majority of these systems utilize a secondary combustion chamber (afterburner) or catalytic oxidizer to thermally destroy the volatilized organics. A few of these systems also have a quench and scrubber after the oxidizer which allows them to treat soils containing chlorinated organics such as solvents and pesticides. The desorbing cylinder for full-scale transportable systems is typically four to ten feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. The maximum practical solids temperature for these systems is around 750 to 900 °F depending on the material of construction of the cylinder. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 3 to 15 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 6 to over 100 tons per hour for transportable units.\n\nHeated screw systems are also an indirect heated system. Typically they use a jacketed trough with a double auger that intermeshes. The augers themselves frequently contain passages for the heating medium to increase the heat transfer surface area. Some systems use electric resistance heaters instead of a heat transfer media and may employ a single auger in each housing. The augers can range from 12 to 36 inches in diameter for full-scale systems, with lengths up to 20 feet. The auger/trough assemblies can be connected in parallel and/or series to increase throughput. Full scale capabilities up to 4 tons per hour have been demonstrated. This type of system has been most successful treating refinery wastes.\n\nIn the early days, there was a continuous infrared system that is no longer in common use. In theory, microwaves would be an excellent technical choice since uniform and accurately controlled heating can be achieved with no heat transfer surface fouling problems. One can only guess that capital and/or energy costs have prevented the development of a microwave thermal desorber at the commercial scale.\n\nThere are only three basic options for offgas treatment available. The volatilized contaminants in the offgas can either be discharged to atmosphere, collected or destroyed. In some cases, both a collection and destruction system are employed. In addition to managing the volatilized components, the particulate solids (dust) that exit the desorber must also be removed from the offgas.\n\nWhen a collection system is used, the offgas must be cooled to condense the bulk of the volatilized components into a liquid. The offgas will exit most desorbers in the 350–900 °F range. The offgas is then typically cooled to somewhere between 120 and 40 °F to condense the bulk of the volatilized water and organic contaminants. Even at 40 °F, there may be measurable amounts of non-condensed organics. For this reason, after the condensation step, further treatment of the offgas is usually required. The cooled offgas may be treated by carbon adsorption, or thermal oxidation. Thermal oxidation can be accomplished using a catalytic oxidizer, an afterburner or by routing the offgas to the combustion heat source for the desorber. The volume of gas requiring treatment for indirect fired desorbers is a fraction of that required for a direct fired desorber. This requires smaller air pollution control trains for the gaseous process vent emissions. Some thermal desorption systems recycle the carrier gas, thereby further reducing the volume of gaseous emissions.\n\nThe condensed liquid from cooling the offgas is separated into organic and aqueous fractions. The water is either disposed of or used to cool the treated solids and prevent dusting. The condensed liquid organic is removed from the site. Depending on its composition, the liquid is either recycled as a supplemental fuel or destroyed in a fixed base incinerator. A thermal desorber removing 500 mg/kg of organic contaminants from 20,000 tons of soil will produce less than of liquid organic. In essence 20,000 tons of contaminated soil could be reduced to less than one tank truck of extracted liquid residue for off-site disposal.\n\nDesorbers using offgas destruction systems use combustion to thermally destroy the volatilized organics components forming CO, CO, NOx, SOx and HCl. The destruction unit may be called an afterburner, secondary combustion chamber, or thermal oxidizer. Catalytic oxidizers may also be used if the organic halide content of the contaminated media is low enough. Regardless of the name, the destruction unit is used to thermally destroy the hazardous organic constituents that were removed (volatilized) from the soil or waste.\n\n\nT. McGowan, T., R.
