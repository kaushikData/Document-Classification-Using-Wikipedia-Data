{"id": "9128918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9128918", "title": "Banjee", "text": "Banjee\n\nBanjee or banjee boy is a term from the 1980s (or earlier) that describes a certain type of young Latino or African American man who has sex with men and who dresses in stereotypical masculine urban fashion for reasons which may include expressing masculinity, hiding his sexual orientation and attracting male partners. The term is mostly associated with New York City and may be Nuyorican in origin. Attitude, clothing, ethnicity, masculinity, physique and youth are all elements of what has been called \"banjee realness\".\n\nAn African-American man writes:\n\nBanjee. That was the identity I was given back in the summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that \"banjee\" meant that I wasn't a \"queen.\" Whatever the terms of identification, all I knew was that there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.\n\nThe 1990 documentary film \"Paris Is Burning\" featured \"banjee realness\" as one of the categories in which contestants competed for trophies. According to \"The Village Voice\" \"banjee boy categories have been a part of vogue balls since at least the early 1980s\".\n\nThe word \"banjee\" never entered mainstream pop culture, but it had currency as gay slang throughout the 1990s. In 1998, a report in the medical journal \"AIDS Patient Care and STDs\" regarding safer sex practices among young Black and Latino men was entitled \"Banjee Boys Are Down\" (\"down\", in this vernacular, meaning \"supportive of it\"), named for a project of Brooklyn's Unity Fellowship Church to get safer sex information to young men of color.\n\nThe 1999 play \"Banjee\", written by playwright A.B. Lugo, presented at the Milagro Theater/Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural and Educational Center (and in another NYC venue in 2004), is \"the story of Angel (played by Indio Meléndez), a straight homeboy, and Tony (played by Will Sierra), an admittedly bi banjee, who've known each other since childhood\".\n\nThe term \"banjee\" has also been used by several producers of gay pornography in presenting the type of young man described herein. For example, in 1995 a company called Pleasure Productions produced a DVD called \"Banjee Black Boys\" (and five similarly named sequels) and a company called Banjee Boy, Inc. produced films with taglines such as \"Wanna see some of the sexiest, thugged out gangstas that NY has to offer?\". There are other examples from adult films, as well as several pornographic websites (such as \"Banjee Boy Group Slam\") that still use the term.\n\nWhile seeming to have peaked in popularity during the 1990s, the term \"banjee\" is still in use. For example, a 2003 web page for a restaurant in East Harlem describes its clientele as an \"eclectic mix of patrons that range from pretty neighborhood Banjee boys to some of the wise guys that once populated the space formerly.\" In 2008 the band Hercules & Love Affair has performed wearing matching shirts with the word printed on them. In the 2000s and 2010s, New York clothing label Hood By Air's designer Shayne Oliver used banjee culture as a general point of reference and a LGBTQ+ clubnight in London in 2013 called itself \"Borja’s Banjee Mix\", referencing black masculinity. Looking backwards, the 2018 period drama \"Pose\", set in 1987's New York City Ball scene, has characters walk for the category \"realness, bring it like a banjee boy\" in episode 1x06 \"Love is the Message\", written by Ryan Murphy and Janet Mock.\n\nHomo thug is a more recent and more popular term which is nearly synonymous with banjee. However, \"homo\" thug does imply that the man in question is primarily homosexual. In contrast, a banjee might be homosexual but might also be bisexual or only have opportunistic homosexual sex with men when women are unavailable — a theme in many of the pornographic films mentioned above.\n\nGayngsta, a portmanteau derived from \"gay\" and \"gangsta\", is another recent coinage. It has mostly been used in relation to the underground LGBT hip hop scene as shown in the documentary \"Pick Up the Mic\" and featured in the \"Homorevolution Tour 2007\" with these artists. While easily discernible in writing, pronunciation is barely discernible from \"gangsta\".\n\nBanjee girl is heard so rarely that it is difficult to define. In discussing a fashion show in Paris, one reviewer wrote in 2005:\n\nThe low-rise skirt in denim is the first of its kind seen on the Paris runways. What is now clear to me is that no self-respecting Banjee Latina, or ghetto-fabulous “Shamecka-girl” or high rolling white chick will be ever able to resist its urban appeal.\n\nSeveral examples of the use of the term \"banjee girl\" exist in the blogosphere but it has rarely, if ever, made it into print or mass media. Exceptions include RuPaul's \"Billboard\" charting single \"Back to My Roots\", which includes the term in a list of hair fashions, an episode of the 2014 season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and Sharaya J, whose 2013 début single was called \"BANJI\"; she also used the name for her production company when she split from Missy Elliott's label The Goldmind Inc. in 2016.\n\nIn the 1990 documentary film \"Paris is Burning\", \"banjee girl\" and \"banjee boy\" were used in comparable frequency. Coupled with the film's focus on the ball culture, an inextricably-connected transgender and drag subculture of 1980s New York City, this lends itself to a contextual definition of those performers impersonating females and attempting to exhibit the ultimately judged quality of holistic visual verisimilitude—\"realness\".\n\n"}
{"id": "51212902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51212902", "title": "Botanical Latin", "text": "Botanical Latin\n\nBotanical Latin is a technical language based on New Latin, used for descriptions of botanical taxa. Until 2012, International Code of Botanical Nomenclature mandated Botanical Latin to be used for the descriptions of most new taxa. It is still the only language other than English accepted for descriptions. The names of organisms governed by the Code also have forms based on Latin.\n\nBotanical Latin is primarily a written language. It includes taxon names derived from any language or even arbitrarily derived, and consequently there is no single consistent pronunciation system. When speakers of different languages use Botanical Latin in speech, they use pronunciations influenced by their own languages, or, notably in French, there may be variant spellings based on the Latin. There are at least two pronunciation systems used for Latin by English speakers. All of these systems, however, will inevitably be unsustainable across the spectrum of botanical names.\n\nAugustin Pyramus de Candolle described the language in 1880:\nC'est le latin arrangé par Linné à l'usage des descriptions et, j'oserai dire, à l'usage de ceux qui n'aiment ni les complications grammaticales, ni les phrases disposées sens desus dessous.\" (Quoted by W. T. Stearn) [It is the Latin chosen by Linnaeus for the purpose of descriptions, and, I dare to say, for the use of those who love neither grammatical complications nor phrases arranged with senses on top of one another.]\n\nDe Candolle estimated that to learn Botanical Latin would take three months' work for an English speaker not already familiar with any language of Latin origin, and one month for an Italian.\n\nWilliam T. Stearn wrote:\nBotanical Latin is best described as a modern Romance language of special technical application, derived from Renaissance Latin with much plundering of ancient Greek, which has evolved, mainly since 1700 and primarily through the work of Carl Linnaeus (1707–78), to serve as an international medium for the scientific naming of plants in all their vast numbers and manifold diversity. These include many thousands of plants unknown to the Greeks and Romans of classical times and for which names have had to be provided as a means of reference. Their description necessitates the recording of structures often too small for comprehension by the naked eye, hence unknown to the ancients and needing words with precise restricted applications foreign to classical Latin.\n\nLatin names of organisms are generally used in English without alteration, but some informal derivatives are used as common names. For example, the -\"idae\" ending of subclass names is changed to -ids (e.g., \"Rosidae\" produces rosids); the subfamily ending -\"oideae\" is changed to -oids (e.g., \"Papilionoideae\" produces papilionoids). The -ids common names have, however also been adopted as rankless clade names, sometimes containing further -ids clade names, so that, for example, in the APG IV classification, rosids contain both fabids and malvids.\nMore extensive modifications to the spelling and pronunciation are routinely used in some other languages. French organism names are usually gallicized. For example: \"Chlorophyceae\" becomes Chlorophycées; \"Portulacineae\" becomes Portulacinées.\n\nThe Classical Latin alphabet consisted of 21 letters, to which w, y, and z were later added, and the vowel/consonant pairs i and j, u and v, were later separated. This 26-letter alphabet is used for taxon names in Botanical Latin. Diacritics are not used in names, and a dieresis is considered an optional mark that does not affect spelling.\n\nSome English speakers, and some speakers of other languages, use the reconstructed pronunciation guide for Classical Latin when speaking Botanical Latin. Latin names pronounced by gardeners and English botanists usually follow a system close to English. It differs greatly from Classical pronunciation, and also from Ecclesiastical Latin pronunciation (which is based on Italian, and has, for example, \"c\" before \"i\" or \"e\" pronounced as \"ch\").\n\nEvery vowel is pronounced, except diphthongs, which are treated as single long vowels.\nIn classical Latin words of several syllables the stress falls on the syllable next to the last one (the penultimate) when this syllable is long ... e.g., \"for-mō'-sus\", or when two consonants separate the two last vowels, e.g., \"cru-ěn'-tus\" ... on the last syllable but two (the antepenultimate) when the last but one is short, e.g. \"flō-ri-dus\".\n\n\"These rules cannot satisfactorily be applied to all generic names and specific epithets commemorating persons. About 80 per cent of generic names and 30 per cent of specific epithets come from languages other than Latin and Greek. A simple and consistent method of pronouncing them does not exist.\"\n\nThe rules also create difficulties with the -\"ii\" and -\"iae\" endings derived from personal names, because the stress falls in a place that is not usual for those names.\n\nThe following table is simplified from Stearn 1992. The pronunciation transcriptions for medical terminology in major medical dictionaries, such as \"Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary\" and \"Stedman's Medical Dictionary\", match these values.\n\n"}

She attended Orange Girl High School in Bloemfontein, before studying at the Universities of Stellenbosch and Orange Free State, where she graduated in Biology (B.s.c.), Physical Education (Performers Licentitate) and Music (piano). She then travelled to Europe to continue her Physical Education studies in the Netherlands, Denmark and London.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter teaching Physical Education at schools in South Africa, Honiball lectured in health and biology education at the Cape Town Training College and at the Pretoria Normal College in Physical Education. She also served as Assistant Head of the Elizabeth Conradie School for disabled children.\n\nIllness\n\nA keen swimmer, she became a junior diving champion of Orange Free State, and a senior diving champion of Western Province (in the Western Cape) in 1946. However, in 1958, Honiball became very ill with tuberculosis and was hospitalized in Kimberley, Northern Cape. Although the illness disappeared, Honiball failed to regain her strength and fell into depression. After hearing of the healing power of fruits by a friend, the author Cornelius Valkenburg de Villiers-Dreyer, whom she married in 1959, and influenced by the writings of South African author Johanna Brandt, she recovered from her condition. When her husband died in 1962, Honiball went on to marry, T. O. Honiball in 1973, a notable cartoonist for The Burger (South Africa) and its magazines.\n\nRebirth\n\nAfter withdrawing from normal life, and adopting a fruit diet (fruits, berries, nuts, seeds, and sometimes vegetables) which she later described in her book \"I Live On Fruit\", she felt transformed, acquiring a healthy body, new outlook on life and new lifestyle, to the surprise of her family and friends. Inspired by the results she had obtained, Honiball initiated the Hokaai! Movement with Herma Loubsa, establishing clubs in different regions of South Africa. The club members, known as Hokaaiers, met every year to attend lectures about the fruit diet and relax in natural surroundings.\n\nWritings\n\nHoniball went on to write several books about her experiences with the fruit diet which were published in Afrikaans and some in English including \"I Live On Fruit\", \"I Live On Fruit And Nothing Else\", and, \"A Fruit Eater Is Born\", which documented 50 years of her life’s work and experiences with diet. According to her writings, she sustained an exclusive fruitarian diet, for a period of 20 years without break, and has continued with the fruitarian diet throughout her life. In 2010, her books \"Ek leef van vrugte\" and \"I Live On Fruit\" will be updated and republished by Benedic Books.\n\nBiography\n\nIn 2010, well-known South African author Anoeschka von Meck, signed an agreement with Benedic Books for the writing of Essie Honiball's biography. Initially the book will be published in Afrikaans with the title: \"Essie Honiball: Die Ontwaking\", and later translated into English with the title: \"Essie Honiball: The Awakening\". The Afrikaans edition is scheduled for release at the end of 2010, and the English edition, at the beginning of 2011.\n\nHoniball is one of a series of latter-20th century writers who writes about fruitarianism, raw nutrition, fasting and detoxification. She has produced a series of 12 books in Afrikaans and English, about the fruit diet and is featured in the book \"Stellenbosch Writers\" by Rosemarie Breuer. She is also cited in\n\"Raw Knowledge: Enhancing The Powers of the Mind, Body and Soul\", by health author, Paul Nison. In 2002, Morris Krok, republished her book \"I Live On Fruit\". The high fruit, low fat and all raw diet, which Honiball promotes has been referred to in the writings of health authors including Anne Osborne, Brian R. Clement Ph.D, Dr. Douglas Graham, and Viktoras Kulvinskas. She received an honorary certificate from Orange Girl High School, Bloemfontein, in 2006.\n\nHoniball's fruitarian diet consisted of fruits, berries, nuts and seeds. Health writers including Robert Gray, Arnold Ehret, Morris Krok and Johnny Lovewisdom, have described how nuts and seeds are not botanically fruits, and too concentrated to form part of the optimum fruitarian diet.\n\nAfrikaans\n\n\nEnglish\n\n"}

{"id": "719398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=719398", "title": "Hadza language", "text": "Hadza language\n\nHadza is a language isolate spoken along the shores of Lake Eyasi in Tanzania by around 1,000 Hadza people, the last full-time hunter-gatherers in Africa. Despite the small number of speakers, language use is vigorous, with most children learning it. In the late 20th century Hadza was included in a proposed Khoisan language family, largely on the basis of its use of clicks, but this classification is no longer accepted.\n\nHadza is a language isolate (Sands 1998, Starostin 2013). It was once classified by many linguists as a Khoisan language, along with its neighbor Sandawe, primarily because they both have click consonants. However, Hadza has very few proposed cognates with either Sandawe or the other Khoisan languages, and many of the ones that have been proposed appear doubtful. The links with Sandawe, for example, are Cushitic loan words, whereas the links with southern Africa are so few and so short (usually single consonant–vowel syllables) that they are most likely coincidental. A few words link it with Oropom, which may itself be spurious; the numerals \"itchâme\" 'one' and \"pie\" 'two' suggest a connection with Kw'adza, an extinct language of hunter-gatherers who may have had recently shifted to Cushitic. (Higher numerals were borrowed in both languages.)\n\nAccording to \"Ethnologue\", Bali may be a dialect of Hadza. The language is marked as \"threatened\".\n\nHadza syllable structure is limited to CV, or CVN if nasal vowels are analyzed as a coda nasal. Vowel-initial syllables do not occur initially, and medially they appear to be equivalent to /hV/.\n\nHadza is noted for having medial clicks (clicks within morphemes). This distribution is also found in Sandawe and the Nguni Bantu languages, but not in the Khoisan languages of southern Africa. Some of these words are historically derivable from clicks in initial positions (many appear to reflect lexicalized reduplication, for example, and some are due to prefixes), but others are opaque. As in Sandawe, most medial clicks are glottalized, but not all: \"puche\" 'a spleen', \"tanche\" 'to aim', \"tacce\" 'a belt', \"minca\" 'to lick one's lips', \"laqo\" 'to trip someone', \"keqhe-na\" 'slow', \"penqhenqhe ~ peqeqhe\" 'to hurry', \"haqqa-ko\" 'a stone', \"shenqe\" 'to peer over', \"exekeke\" 'to listen', \"naxhi\" 'to be crowded', \"khaxxe\" 'to jump', \"binxo\" 'to carry kills under one's belt'.\n\nIt is not known if Hadza has lexical tone. It may have a pitch accent system, but the details have not been worked out. There are no known lexical minimal pairs for stress/tone, though the suffix for the habitual mood is tonic.\n\nHadza has five vowels, . Long vowels may occur when intervocalic is elided. For example, or , \"to climb\". Nasal vowels, although uncommon, do occur, though not before consonants that have prenasalized homologues. (That is, and are in complementary distribution.) All vowels are nasalized before glottalized nasal clicks.\n\n\nA practical orthography has been devised by Miller and Anyawire (Miller et al. 2013). As of 2015, this orthography is not being used by any Hadza speakers and is therefore of limited value for communication in Hadza. It is broadly similar to the orthographies of neighboring languages such as Swahili, Isanzu, Iraqw, and Sandawe. The apostrophe, which is ubiquitous in transcription in the anthropological literature but causes problems with literacy, has been reduced: Glottal stop between like vowels is indicated by vowel sequences (that is, is written , as in 'the Hadza'), and ejectives and glottalized clicks by gemination (apart from reduced instead of *ddl for ). The ejectives are based on the voiced consonants, , because these are otherwise found mostly in borrowings and thus not common. \"Tc\" and \"tch\" are as in Sandawe, \"sl\" as in Iraqw. (This is ultimately a French convention.) Nasalized vowels are . Long vowels are or , because they are usually due to an elided . A tonic syllable may be written with an acute accent, , but is generally not marked.\n\nSource: Miller (2008).\n\nHadza is a head-marking language in both clauses and noun phrases. Word order is flexible; the default constituent order is VSO, though VOS and fronting to SVO are both very common. The order of determiner, noun, and attributive also varies, though with morphological consequences. There is number and gender agreement on both attributives (for head nouns) and verbs (for subjects).\n\nReduplication of the initial syllable of a word, usually with tonic accent and a long vowel, is used to indicate 'just' (meaning either 'merely' or 'solely') and is quite common. It occurs on both nouns and verbs, and reduplication can be used to emphasize other things, such as the habitual suffix \"-hé-\" or the pluractional infix \"\".\n\nNouns have grammatical gender (masculine and feminine) and number (singular and plural). They are marked by suffixes as follows:\nThe feminine plural is used for mixed natural gender, as in \"Hazabee\" 'the Hadza'. For many animals, the grammatical singular is transnumeric, as in English: \"dongoko\" 'zebra' (either one or a group). The masculine plural may trigger vowel harmony: \"dongobee\" 'zebras' (an individuated number), \"dungubii\" 'zebra bucks'. A couple kin terms and the diminutive suffix \"-nakwe\" take \"-te\" in the m.sg., which is otherwise unmarked.\n\nGender is used metaphorically, with ordinarily feminine words made masculine if they are notably thin, and ordinarily masculine words made feminine if they are notably round. Gender also distinguishes such things as vines (m) and their tubers (f), or berry trees (f) and their berries (m). Mass nouns tend to be grammatically plural, such as \"atibii\" 'water' (cf. \"ati\" 'rain', \"atiko\" 'a spring').\n\nThe names reported for dead animals do not follow this pattern. Calling attention to a dead zebra, for example, uses the form \"hantaii\" (masculine \"hantaee\", plural (rare) \"hataetee\" and \"hantaitchii\"). This is because these forms are not nouns, but imperative verbs; the morphology is clearer in the imperative plural, when addressing more than one person: \"hantatate, hantâte, hantaetate, hantaitchate\" (substitute \"-si\" for final \"-te\" when addressing only men; see below for the verbal object suffixes \"-ta-, -a-, -eta-, -itcha-\").\n\nThe \"-pe\" and \"-pi\" forms of nouns often seen in the anthropological literature (actually \"-phee\" and \"-phii\") are copular: \"dongophee\" 'they are zebras'. The copular suffixes distinguish gender in all persons as well as clusivity in the 1st person. They are:\nForms with high vowels (\"i, u\") tend to raise preceding mid vowels to high, just as \"-bii\" does. The 3.sg copula tends to sound like a \"-ya(ko)\" or \"-wa(ko)\" after high and often mid vowels: ≈ , and transcriptions with \"w\" and \"y\" are common in the literature. \n\nPersonal and demonstrative pronouns are:\n\nThere are some additional 3rd-person pronouns, including some compound forms. Adverbs are formed from the 3rd-person forms by adding locative \"-na\": \"hamana\" 'here', \"beena\" 'there', \"naná\" 'over there', \"himiggêna\" 'in/behind there'.\n\nAn infix , where V is an echo vowel, occurs after the first syllable of verbs to indicate pluractionality.\n\nThe copula was covered above. Hadza has several auxiliary verbs: sequential \"ka-\" and \"ya-\" 'and then', negative \"akhwa-\" 'not', and subjunctive \"i-\". Their inflections may be irregular or have different inflectional endings from those of lexical verbs, which are as follows:\n\nThe functions of the anterior and posterior differ between auxiliaries; with lexical verbs, they are non-past and past. The potential and veridical conditionals reflex the degree of certainty that something would have occurred. 1sg.npst \"-ˆta\" and a couple other forms lengthen the preceding vowel. The 1.ex forms apart from \"-ya\" begin with a glottal stop. The imp.sg is a glottal stop followed by an echo vowel.\n\nHabitual forms take a tonic \"-hé\", which tends to reduce to a long vowel, before these endings. In some verbs, the habitual has become lexicalized (marking the forms with glottal stop), and so an actual habitual takes a second \"-hé\". Various compound tense-aspect-moods occur by doubling up the inflectional endings. There are several additional inflections which have not been worked out.\n\nThe inflectional endings are clitics and may occur on an adverb before the verb, leaving a bare verb stem (verb root plus object suffixes).\n\nAs is common in the area, there are only a few bare-root adjectives in Hadza, such as \"pakapaa\" 'big'. Most attributive forms take a suffix with cross-gender number marking: \"-e\" (m.sg. and f.pl.) or \"-i\" (f.sg. and m.pl.). These agree with the noun they modify. The \"-i\" form tends to trigger vowel harmony, so that, for example, the adjective \"one-\" 'sweet' has the following forms:\nThe \"-ko/-bee/-bii\" ending may be replaced by the copula, but the \"e/i\" cross-number gender marking remains.\n\nDemonstratives, adjectives, and other attributives may occur before or after a noun, but nouns only take their gender number endings when they occur first in the noun phrase: \"Ondoshibii unîbii\" 'sweet cordia berries', \"manako unîko\" 'tasty meat', but \"unîbii ondoshi\" and \"unîko mana\". Similarly, \"dongoko bôko\" but \"bôko dongo\" 'those zebra'.\n\nVerbs may also be made attributive: \"dluzîko akwiti\" 'the woman (\"akwitiki\") who is speaking', from \"dlozo\" 'to say'. This attributive form is used with the copula to form the progressive aspect: \"dlozênee\" 'I am speaking' (male speaker), \"dluzîneko\" 'I am speaking' (female speaker).\n\nVerbs may take up to two object suffixes, for a direct object (DO) and indirect object (IO). These only differ in the 1ex and 3sg. The IO suffixes are also used on nouns to indicate possession (\"mako-kwa\" 'my pot', \"mako-a-kwa\" 'it is my pot').\nTwo object suffixes are only allowed if the first (the DO) is 3rd person. In such cases the DO reduces to the form of the attributive suffix: \"-e\" (m.sg. / f.pl.) or \"-i\" (f.sg. / m.pl.); only context tells which combination of number and gender is intended. 3rd-singular direct objects also reduce to this form in the imperative singular; 3rd-plural change their vowels but do not conflate with the singular: see 'dead zebra' under nouns above for an example of the forms.\n\nThe factors governing the word order within noun phrases are not known. Constituent order tends to be SXVO (where X is an auxiliary) for a new or emphasized subject, with the subject moving further back (XSVO, XVSO, and XVOS), or simply not mentioned (XVO) the better it is established. Where context, semantics, and the verbal suffixes fail to disambiguate, \"verb–noun–noun\" is understood to be VSO.\n\nThe Hadza did not have numerals before the introduction of Swahili language. Native numerals are \"itchâme\" 'one' and \"pie\" 'two'. \"Sámaka\" 'three' is a Datooga loan, and \"bone\" 'four', \"bothano\" 'five', and \"ikhumi\" 'ten' are Sukuma. \"Aso\" 'many' is commonly used instead of \"bothano\" for 'five'. There is no systematic way to express other numbers without using Swahili.\n\nHadza has received some attention for a dozen 'celebratory' (Woodburn) or 'triumphal' (Blench) names for dead animals. These are used to announce a kill. They are (in the imperative singular):\nThe words are somewhat generic: \"henqêe\" may be used for any spotted cat, \"hushuee (hushuwee)\" for any running ground bird. 'Lion' and 'eland' use the same root. Blench (2008) thinks this may have something to do with the eland being considered magical in the region.\n\nAn IO suffix may be used to reference the person who made the kill. Compare \"hanta-\" 'zebra' with the more mundane verbs, \"qhasha\" 'to carry' and \"kw-\" 'to give', in the imperative singular and plural (Miller 2009):\n\nIn 2003 the press widely reported suggestions by Alec Knight and Joanna Mountain of Stanford University that the original human language may have had clicks. The purported evidence for this is genetic: speakers of Juǀ'hoan and Hadza have the most divergent known mitochondrial DNA of any human populations, suggesting that they were the first, or at least among the first, surviving peoples to have split off the family tree. In other words, the three primary genetic divisions of humanity are the Hadza, the Juǀʼhoan and relatives, and everyone else. Because two of the three groups speak languages with clicks, perhaps their common ancestral language, which by implication is the ancestral language for all humankind, had clicks as well.\n\nHowever, besides the genetic interpretation, this conclusion rests on several unsupported assumptions: \n\nThere is no evidence that any of these assumptions are correct, or even likely. Linguistic opinion is that click consonants may well be a relatively late development in human language, that they are no more resistant to change or any more likely to be linguistic relics than other speech sounds, and that they are easily borrowed: at least one Khoisan language, ǁXegwi, is believed to have reborrowed clicks from Bantu languages, which had earlier borrowed them from Khoisan languages, for example. The Knight and Mountain article is the latest in a long line of speculations about the primitive origin of click consonants, which have been largely motivated by the outdated idea that primitive people speak primitive languages, which has no empirical support.\n\n\n"}

His Village is Mirjoli near Chiplun.\n\nDalwai joined the Indian Socialist Party of Jai Prakash Narayan in his early adulthood, but left it to devote himself to social reforms in the Muslim community, especially regarding women's rights. Despite living in a period when most people were staunchly religious and orthodox, Hamid Dalwai was one among the few religiously secular people. He strove towards a uniform civil code rather than religion specific laws, and fought to abolish Triple talaq in India.\n\nTo create a platform for his views and work, he established the \"Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal\" (Muslim Truth Seeking Society) in Pune on 22 March 1970. Through the medium of this Society, Hamid worked towards reforming bad practices in the Muslim community especially towards women. He helped many Muslim women who were victimised to get justice. He campaigned for encouraging Muslims in acquiring education in the State language rather than Urdu, their mother tongue. He also tried to make adoption an acceptable practice in the Indian Muslim community.\n\nHe also established the Muslim Secular Society. He organised many public meetings, gatherings, conventions and conferences to campaign for better social practices. He was also a great Marathi litterateur. He wrote Indhan (Fuel) - a novel, Laat (Wave) - a collection of short stories and Muslim Politics in Secular India - a thought provoking book. He used the medium of his writing for social reform.\n\nAn unprecedented event in his social work was the Muslim women’s march that he organised on the Mantralaya (the administrative headquarters of Maharashtra in South Mumbai, built in 1955) to fight for their rights. Hamid Dalwai dealt with opposition with tremendous equanimity and worked towards social reform without getting discouraged at the slow rate of success. It is because of these traits that the great Marathi genius P. L. Aka PuLa Deshpande described him as a great social reformer and put him in the same bracket as the great Indian leaders Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Ambedkar.\n\nHe died of progressive kidney failure on 3 May 1977, at the age of 44.\n\nDalwai worked as a journalist. His works include \"Lat\" (The Wave) and \"Indhan\" (Fuel) in Marathi, and \"Muslim Politics In Secular India\" in English, \"Islam che Bhartiya Chitr\" (Islam's Indian story) in Marathi, \"Rashtriya Ekatmata aani Bhartiya Musalman\" (National Unity and Indian Muslim) in Marathi.He also has written a short story namely \"10 rupayachi goshta\" which was later published in \"Dhanurdhara\" magazine.\n\nDalwai's brother Husain Dalwai is a Congress leader in Maharashtra. He is currently a member of Parliament upper house - Rajya Sabha. He also served as a Congress spokesperson in Maharashtra.\n\n\nIn 2017 a documentary about Hamid Dalwai was made by actress Jyoti Subhash.\n"}

With the advent of large commercial broadcast radio network companies, and the general adoption of the term \"public radio\" in the United States to refer to non-religious radio-oriented listener-supported stations, the term has also been used to refer to commercial radio stations that are run \"independently\" of the large radio conglomerates.\n\n"}

{"id": "23513517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23513517", "title": "Irish kinship", "text": "Irish kinship\n\nIrish kinship is a system of kinship terminology (descended from the original Celtic practices) which shows a bifurcate collateral pattern. This system is used by a minority of people living in the Gaeltacht regions of Ireland. Irish kinship terminology varies from English kinship as it focuses on gender and generation, with less emphasis on differentiating lineal vs. collateral.\n\nIrish kinship is limited to a small number of words of Gaelic origin used in identifying relatives.\n\nMáthair - Mother\nAthair - Father\nMac - Son\nIníon - Daughter\nDeartháir - Brother\nDeirfiúr - Sister\nAintín- Aunt\nUncail - Uncle\nNia - Nephew\nNeacht - Niece\nSeanmháthair - Grandmother\nSeanathair - Grandfather\nGarmhac - Grandson\nGariníon - Granddaughter\nCol Gaolta - Cousin\n\nA majority of the terms used in the kinship system are similar to the English kinship system, but the terms for aunt, uncle, nephew, niece and cousin have a far vaguer and different use. These terms, however, vary in degree of use as this system is largely confined to the Gaeltacht regions, and hence not widely used among other members of Irish society. The system has, however, been previously taught in primary schools around the country, including in non-Gaeltacht areas.\n\n\"Aintin\" is the word for \"aunt\" and \"Uncail\" for \"uncle\" but in the Irish kinship system aunt and uncle have a wider definition; in common kinship an aunt or uncle is the sister or brother of either the mother or the father. However, in Irish kinship, \"Aintin\" and \"Uncail\" are used for not only the siblings of the parents, but as well for any relative whose age is of a great distance from the child. This effectively means the cousin of a parent is called an aunt or uncle, while those who are aged or in their senior years (aunts or uncles of a parent, or cousins of a grandparent) are termed \"Seanaintin\" and \"Seanuncail\" (great aunt and great uncle). Using this system, the children of cousins in a person’s own generation (however distant) are called nephews and nieces, using the terms \"Nia\" and \"Neacht.\" Grandchildren of brothers, sisters or cousins of the same generation are termed \"Garnia\" (great-nephew) or \"Garneacht\" (great-niece).\n\n\"Col Gaolta\" is a word for cousin; in the Irish kinship system, this word is used for all relatives in one's generation or those near your age, except in the case of a brother or a sister. The word actually means \"related by blood\".\n\nMo Mhuintir, being Irish for \"My People\", is a vague term used for relatives people believe they are related to, but do not have enough information to determine how.\n"}

The original feature of LRE Map is that the records are collected during the submission of different major Natural language processing conferences. The records are then cleaned and gathered into a global database called \"LRE Map\".\n\nThe LRE Map is intended to be an instrument for collecting information about language resources and to become, at the same time, a community for users, a place to share and discover resources, discuss opinions, provide feedback, discover new trends, etc. It is an instrument for discovering, searching and documenting language resources, here intended in a broad sense, as both data and tools.\n\nThe large amount of information contained in the Map can be analyzed in many different ways. A few, general analyses are available on the Resource Map website at http://www.resourcebook.eu (click on the “Show (Hide) Quick Pies” link). For instance, the LRE Map can provide information about the most frequent type of resource, the most represented language, the applications for which resources are used or are being developed, the proportion of new resources vs. already existing ones, or the way in which resources are distributed to the community.\n\nSeveral institutions worldwide maintain catalogues of language resources\n(ELRA, LDC, NICT Universal Catalogue, ACL Data and Code Repository, OLAC, LT World, etc.) However, it has been estimated that only 10% of existing resources are known, either through distribution catalogues or via direct publicity by providers (web sites and the like). The rest remains hidden, the only occasions where it briefly emerges being when a resource is presented in the context of a research paper or report at some conference. Even in this case, nevertheless, it might be that a resource remains in the background simply because the focus of the research is not on the resource \"per se\".\n\nThe LRE Map originated under the name \"LREC Map\" during the preparation of LREC 2010 conference. More specifically, the idea was discussed within the FlaReNet project, and in collaboration with ELRA and the Institute of Computational Linguistics of CNR in Pisa, the Map was put in place at LREC 2010. The LREC organizers asked the authors to provide some basic information about all the resources (in a broad sense, i.e. including tools, standards and evaluation packages), either used or created, described in their papers. All these descriptors were then gathered in a global matrix called the LREC Map.\n\nThe same methodology and requirements from the authors has been then applied and extended to other conferences, namely COLING-2010, EMNLP-2010, RANLP-2011, LREC 2012, LREC 2014 and LREC 2016.<br>\nAfter this generalization to other conferences, the LREC Map has been renamed as the LRE Map.\n\nThe size of the database increases over time. The data collected amount to 4776 entries.\n\nEach resource is described according to the following attributes:\n\nThe LRE map is a very important tool to chart the NLP field.

If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an extinct language. UNESCO defines four levels of language endangerment between \"safe\" (not endangered) and \"extinct\": There are primarily eight languages that were spoken in Canada around 2010.\n\n\nThere is a \"phonological process,\" or patterns used to simplify speech in the Oneida language that has been passed down for generations, this process is described as the loss of voicing in the vowel of the last syllable of a word. This process is vital to the preservation of the language, and has been changing among the speakers, such that some speakers have introduced a degree of voiced vowels in these final forms, which poises additional stress on the small population of speakers. The introduction in voicing the last syllable in words that typically are unvoiced is that it changes the traditional morphology of the language, pushing the original dialect towards language death, especially since the majority of speakers are older in age.\n\nThe Blackfoot language consists of the loss of voicing in the last syllable of a word, which is typically inaudible. Certain inflections, or the use of inaudible vowels has been identified as \"old Blackfoot\" (traditional), and are not in frequent use by younger speakers. Similarly, a minority of Blackfoot speakers use the \"soundless\" suffixes, which is pushing the traditional language towards more extreme language endangerment and potentially language death.\n\nThe Chipewyan language exhibits morphological characteristics that are far more complex than the majority of European languages. This includes conditioning of tone and morphology of phonemes, as well as frequent contractions, elisions, metatheses, and consonantal substitutions. Chipewyan is mainly endangered due to its complex structure, which makes it difficult to decipher the morphological code, as well as the fact that the majority of the speakers are in their mid-late adulthood.\n\nAssinibone is one of the language divisions out of five main language divisions within the Dakotan group of the Siouan family. The sound of this language differs from the other languages in the group because it merges voiceless stops with voiced stops. There are reports that syllabics to have been used by Assinibone speakers. (A written character to represent a syllable). The Assiniboine language is spread over 2 communities in Canada, and is mainly used by older adults.\n\nThere are about 8,000 speakers in the central Ojibwe language, and it has been spread over 16 communities in Canada. The language is spoken from Ontario Canada to Manitoba. It is also spoken in places from Michigan to Montana next to the Great Lakes which is the home of the Ojibwe people. The language today is spoken by people over the age of 70. The people of the Ojibwe language note that double vowels in their language are treated as standing for unit sounds, therefore they are alphabetized after corresponding single values.\n\nThere are about 6,000 speakers in the Northern Plain States of North Dakota and South Dakota. Most native speakers are in their mid-50s. There is a growing interest to revitalize the language. At the Red Cloud Indian school, there are immersion classes for children to teach the language. However, at the moment, there are no children on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that are fluent in the language. Within the next ten years, there will be children fluent in Lakota.\n\nThere are about 20,000 native speakers, primarily in the North Dakota and South Dakota area, about 4,000 of which live in Minnesota. Dakota Wicohon is an after school camp that helps children learn the language, since it is not taught in the government-run boarding schools for American Indian youth. To help preservation efforts, technology like phraselators come into play, allowing learners to type in the words they want or orally speak the word they want and the machine will find it for them.\n\nThere are about 2,640 speakers of the language in the Canadian Northwest Territories from the Great Slave Lake to the Great Bear Lake. Dogrib phonology is rather intricate and is organized into 5 levels. The first person to write a book in Dogrib was Herb Zimmerman, who translated the Bible into the language in 1981. Unlike many other Native American languages, there are children who are fluent in the language.\n\nThis was typically a First Nations speaking language, and mainly lived in northern British Columbia and some from southeast Yukon in Canada. People who speak Kaska today still live within the British Columbia and Yukon Territory area. The speakers are elders, such as grandparents, and their children and grandchildren would speak English. First Nations have started work to re-create and preserve their heritage language.\n\nThe number of people who speak the Ottawa dialect is unknown, though it is predicted to be around 13,000. Native communities received $5 million a year for 7 years (2007-2014) to help them in their efforts to preserve their languages and teach it to their children. The language is written with Latin letters and is a dialect of the Ojibwe language. Many descendants of migrants now live in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nThere are roughly 3,200 people who speak Stoney in the Northern Plains and the Alberta province of Canada. Stoney has a Latin alphabet. The stress is one of the harder aspects about the language. The Stoney Indian Language Project was created to help make a standard format of the Stoney language. The project created 6 books for adults and children, as well as a videotape for third graders.\n\nThe Potawatomi Language is critically endangered because there are only 52 fluent speakers left surrounding the Great Lakes region in Michigan. Within a decade, those who are fluent (the majority being the elderly) will soon be dead, causing the culture to die out with them, along with the knowledge of history that has been passed down from previous generations. English has become the predominant language spoken in homes due to the halt of parents speaking Potawatomi to children from 20 to more than 50 years ago. Currently there are no teachings of the language but there are revitalization efforts to bring back the language and the culture that could possibly be gone forever.\n\nTuscarora entails complex morphology dealing with the copying of words, roots, stems, and affixes. There was a time where the Tuscarora language was spoken 'as the mother tongue,' used for all situations, (formal and informal) but now there are approximately only four to five remaining elders who are fluent in the language. All of the elders are around the ages of seventy to eighty years old, where a possible result is the extinction of the Tuscarora language.\n\nThe Native American Cayuga speaking people are located in Oklahoma and Ontario. With the splitting of the people into two geographical locations, they now begin to differ in terms of language usage, morphology and phonology. In the setting of Oklahoma, Cayuga has become influenced by other tribes and has to a certain extent, lost their original vocabulary. Cayuga contains a pitch accent where the placement of it can be predicted by metrical structure and constraints on the structure of the syllables.\n\nThe Upper Tanana Language originally was spoken in only five villages, each with a different dialect. Those villages were Beaver Creek, Scottie Creek, Northway, Nabesna, and Tetlin. Today, the language is only spoken by about 95 people, above the age of 50, in eastern interior Alaska. Depending on the dialect, the Upper Tanana Language has about six to seven phonemic vowels. the primary difference between the dialects is by the pitch of the tone. Also a major factor in the split of different dialects is that different dialects have different vowel inventories.\n\nDespite misinterpretation of studies which describe the phonetic inventory of Nootka, these studies do not suggest that its phonemic inventory is the main reason why the Nootka language may be severely endangered. A process known as glottalization is a key factor in being able to articulate certain sounds in the language, called ejective consonants. Though these sounds are not in English, they not linguistically rare. Many languages with a large body of speakers, including Arabic and Amharic contain these sounds, an observation which immediately discredits this theory. It is clear that Nootka, like all Canadian aboriginal languages, is endangered due to social factors alone.\n"}

{"id": "16421777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16421777", "title": "Metrical phonology", "text": "Metrical phonology\n\nMetrical phonology is a theory of stress or linguistic prominence. The innovative feature of this theory is that the prominence of a unit is defined relative to other units in the same phrase. For example, in the most common pronunciation of the phrase \"doctors use penicillin\" (if said out-of-the-blue), the syllable '-ci-' is the strongest or most stressed syllable in the phrase, but the syllable 'doc-' is more stressed than the syllable '-tors'. Previously, generative phonologists and the American Structuralists represented prosodic prominence as a feature that applied to individual phonemes (segments) or syllables. \nThis feature could take on multiple values to indicate various levels of stress. Stress was assigned using the cyclic reapplication of rules to words and phrases. \n\nMetrical phonology holds that stress is separate from pitch accent and has phonetic effects on the realization of syllables beyond their intonation, including effects on their duration and amplitude. \nThe perceived stress of a syllable results from its position in the metrical tree and metrical grid for the phrase it appears in.\n\nLinguistic prominence in metrical phonology is partially determined by the relations between nodes in a branching tree, in which one node is Strong (S) and the other node or nodes are Weak (W). The labels Strong and Weak have no inherent phonetic realization, and only have meaning relative to the rest of the labels in the tree. A Strong node is stronger than its Weak sister node. The most prominent syllable in a phrase is the one that does not have any Weak nodes above it. This syllable is called the Designated Terminal Element. In the example tree (1), the syllable '-ci-' is the Designated Terminal Element. \n\nMetrical trees allow us to change the stress pattern for a phrase by switching S and W sister nodes. The tree in (1) represents the metrical structure for the sentence \"Doctors use penicillin\". when the sentence is providing all new information. This is called broad focus, and might be used in response to a question like \"What did you learn at the hospital today?\" The same metrical structure would be used when the sentence has narrow focus on the word 'penicillin'; for example, if it was used in response to a question like \"What do doctors use to treat that disease?\". However, we need a new metrical structure to put narrow focus on the word 'doctors', for example, if the phrase is used in response to the question \"Who uses penicillin?\" In this case, the S and W nodes at the intermediate phrase (ip) level have to switch, resulting in (2). \n\nIn metrical phonology there has been debate about whether nodes on metrical trees must have two children, making them binary branching,\n\nor whether they can have any number of children, making them n-ary branching.\nProponents of binary branching trees have claimed that such trees can constrain the restructuring of very long and very short constituents because new nodes created in this restructuring have to correspond to nodes in the original tree. Proponents of n-ary branching trees point out that only multiple branches allow a limited number of tree levels, which can correspond to predetermined levels of prosodic constituents, whereas binary branching trees require intermediate levels that do not correspond to any prosodic constituent. A number of levels of prosodic constituents have been proposed, including: moras, syllables, feet, phonological words, clitic groups, phonological phrases, intermediate phrases, intonational phrases, and phonological utterances. The relations between prosodic constituents at different levels is commonly thought to be governed by the Strict Layer Hypothesis (SLH). This hypothesis states that in metrical trees, all prosodic constituents at a particular level consist exclusively of constituents from the level below. The SLH forbids a number of types of tree structures, including trees in which: a node has two parents in the level above, a node has two or more different types of children, a node has children from a level that is not the level immediately below it, a node does not correspond to any of the specified levels, or a node has children of the same type as itself. \n\nThe various levels of the prosodic hierarchy are independently justified by the phonological phenomena that make reference to them. For instance, in English the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/ are aspirated (followed by a puff of air) only if they are the first segment in a foot. Similarly, in the Gorgia Toscana variety of Italian, the intonation phrase is the domain of a rule that changes voiceless plosives (/p/, /t/, /k/) between vowels into fricative consonants, like /θ/ (th) and /h/.\n\nIn addition to describing prominence relations between words, metrical trees can also describe prominence relations within words. Indeed, a set of rules developed by Liberman and Prince can be used to quite accurately predict stress in English words. Their Lexical Category Prominence Rule states that the second node in a pair of sister nodes is labeled W unless one of a number of conditions are met, such as the node branching or dominating a particular suffix, in which case it is labeled S. Allowable tree structures and node labels for a particular word in Liberman and Prince's system are constrained by the two-value feature [± stress], which can be assigned to segments or syllables by separate rules that refer to the number and type of segments in the syllable and the syllable's position in the word. Syllables that are [- stress] can only be immediately dominated by a W node. However, syllables that are [+ stress] can be immediately dominated by S or W nodes.\n\nIn a Metrical grid, all the words in the phrase are arranged along the bottom and the rows of the grid indicate different levels of prominence, as in (3). \n\n(3) Example metrical grid\n\nThe higher the column of Xs above a syllable, the more prominent the syllable is. The metrical grid and the metrical tree for a particular utterance are related in such a way that the Designated Terminal Element of an S node must be more prominent than the Designated Terminal Element of its sister W node. So in (3), the metrical grid for the utterance in (1), '-ci-' must be more prominent than 'doc-' because '-ci-' is the Designated Terminal Element of the highest S node and 'doc-' is the Designated Terminal Element of its sister W node. \n\nThe structure of the metrical grid explains a number of otherwise surprising features of prominence patterns in language. For example, the main stress in English phrases may be placed several syllables away from the end of the phrase, even though the rule assigning this stress looks for a lexically stressed syllable near this boundary. Using a metrical grid, this rule can simply apply to the rightmost element in the highest row of the grid. Therefore, what seemed to be a non-local application of the phrasal stress rule is reinterpreted as the local application of the rule to the highest row of the metrical grid. \n\nMetrical grids were originally developed to handle a phenomenon that appears in some languages, including English, German, and Masoretic Hebrew, in which stress shifts to avoid a 'stress clash'. A stress clash can occur when two stressed syllables are too close to each other. For example, the word 'nineteen' spoken in isolation has stress on the second syllable. But when it is placed before 'girls' the stress on 'nineteen' can shift to the first syllable. Two syllables exhibit stress clash if there are two successive rows in the grid in which their columns are adjacent (i.e. there is no X between them). For example, in grid (4) the columns for 'teen' and 'girls' are adjacent in both the first and second rows, indicating a stress clash. \n\n(4) Pre-stress-shift metrical grid\n\nStress clashes can be resolved by the Rhythm Rule, which reverses the S-W relation for some pair of sister nodes, as long as such a reversal does not put a Designated Terminal Element of an Intonational Phrase under any W node, and doesn't put a [- stress] syllable directly under an S node. In (4) the W and S nodes over 'nine-' and '-teen' can be reversed, leading to the non-clashing grid in (5). \n\n(5) Post-stress-shift metrical grid\n\nThis process is optional, and seems to be applied more often in some circumstances than others.\n\nHayes (1981) describes four metrical parameters which can be used to group languages according to their word-level stress patterns. \n\n\nHayes (1995) describes metrical parameters that can analyse/predict word-level stress placement:\n\nHierarchical patterns of prominence like those represented in metrical trees can also apply to rhythm in music. The prominence level of a note is determined by the relative prominence of all the nodes above it. The timing of notes also depends on the metrical tree for a particular tune. Each node at the bottom level of the tree (terminal nodes) receives a beat. Empty terminal nodes correspond to rests or form part of a note that spans several beats. Syncopation in music can result when relatively strong nodes are empty.\n\nMetrical phonology offers a number of advantages over a system representing stress as a feature that applies to individual segments or syllables, without reference to the other syllables in a phrase. Creators of traditional feature systems posited the stress feature, which differed from other phonological features in several key ways. For instance, the feature stress had an arbitrary number of values or levels, rather than two or some justified number more than two. In addition, the non-primary stress values in these systems were only defined relative to the primary stress value, and did not have local acoustic or articulatory effects. By not treating stress as a feature of an individual segment, metrical phonology avoids the inexplicable differences between the stress feature and other phonological features.\n\nMetrical phonology also correctly predicts the ambiguity between broad and narrow focus. There are two possible metrical patterns for two-word phrases: S-W and W-S. However, there are three possible patterns of focus for such phrases: narrow focus on the first word, narrow focus on the second word, and broad focus. For instance, the phrase \"Gus skied\" can either be pronounced \"GUS skied\" (S-W) or \"Gus SKIED\" (W-S). These two realizations are the only options for answering the three questions: Who skied? (narrow focus on 'Gus'), What did Gus do? (narrow focus on 'skied'), and What happened yesterday? (broad focus).\n\nFinally, metrical phonology is consistent with patterns of deaccenting in which accents can shift both left and right. This is because swapping S and W nodes will cause stress to move left if the S node was originally on the right, and move right if it was originally on the left. Such bi-directional movement is more difficult to predict under a stress-shift rule, which would specify the direction of movement.\n"}
{"id": "174252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174252", "title": "Mezzotint", "text": "Mezzotint\n\nMezzotint is a printmaking process of the intaglio family, technically a drypoint method. It was the first tonal method to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like hatching, cross-hatching or stipple. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a \"rocker\". In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.\n\nThe mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the German amateur artist Ludwig von Siegen (1609–). His earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-Münzenberg. This was made by working from light to dark. The rocker seems to have been invented by Prince Rupert of the Rhine, a famous cavalry commander in the English Civil War, who was the next to use the process, and took it to England. Sir Peter Lely saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits, and encouraged a number of Dutch printmakers to come to England. Godfrey Kneller worked closely with John Smith, who is said to have lived in his house for a period; he created about 500 mezzotints, some 300 copies of portrait paintings. \n\nThe process was especially widely used in England from the eighteenth century, to reproduce portraits and other paintings. Since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used. Robert Kipniss and Peter Ilsted are two notable 20th-century exponents of the technique; M. C. Escher also made eight mezzotints.\n\nBritish mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the Great Crash of 1929, also spreading to America. The main area of collecting was British portraits; hit oil paintings from the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition were routinely, and profitably, reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period, and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures, or if necessary, made them up. The favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820, the great period of the British portrait. There were two basic styles of collection: some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope, while others aimed at perfect condition and quality (which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate), and in collecting the many \"proof states\" which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on. Leading collectors included William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore and the Irishman John Chaloner Smith.\n\nThis became the most common method. The whole surface (usually) of a metal, usually copper, plate is roughened evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically. If the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool. A burnisher has a smooth, round end, which flattens the minutely protruding points comprising the roughened surface of the metal printing plate. Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print \"white,\" that is, without ink. By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name \"mezzo-tinto\" which is Italian for \"half-tone\" or \"half-painted\". This is called working from \"dark to light\", or the \"subtractive\" method.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively, where the darker parts of the image are to be. This is called working from \"light to dark\", or the \"additive\" method. The first mezzotints by Ludwig von Siegen were made in this way. Especially in this method, the mezzotint can be combined with other intaglio techniques, such as engraving, on areas of the plate not roughened, or even with the dark to light method.\n\nPrinting the finished plate is the same for either method, and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate; the whole surface is inked, the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate. The plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper, and the process repeated.\n\nBecause the pits in the plate are not deep, only a small number of top-quality impressions (copies) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out. Perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken.\n\nPlates can be mechanically roughened; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the copper. The plate is then moved – either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference – and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.\n\nMezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with burin, \"burnisher\" and \"scraper\" allows fine gradations in tone to be developed. The scraper is a triangular ended tool, and the burnisher has a smooth round end – not unlike many spoon handles.\n\n\n\n"}

It is commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders of the basal ganglia, such as in Parkinson's disease, but it has also been ascribed to subcortical focal lesions. O'Sullivan and Schmitz describe it as an abnormally small handwriting that is difficult to read, as seen in the photo to the right. Micrographia is also seen in patients with Wilson's disease, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Metamorphopsia, or with isolated focal lesions of the midbrain or basal ganglia. \n\nA common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is difficulty in routine activities due to lack of motor control. More specifically, patients have difficulty maintaining the scale of movements and have reduced amplitude of movement; also known as hypokinesia. These difficulties with scaling and controlling the amplitude of movement cause patients with PD to have difficulty with complex, sequential movements. This helps to explain why micrographia is a common symptom of the disease. Another reason is a lack of physical dexterity.\n\nJames Parkinson may have been aware of micrographia in patients with shaking palsy (later renamed Parkinson's disease), when he described \"the hand failing to answer with exactness to the dictates of the will\".\n\nMicrographia is seen in 9 to 75% of PD patients and often appears before other cognitive symptoms.\n\nMicrographia may worsen when a PD patient is under-medicated or when the effects of the medication are wearing off.\n"}

He stayed at Jaipur (Rajasthan) and taught in the school run by the freedom fighter Arjunlal Sethi. (Maharashtra state \"Swatantyra sainik kosh-Paschim Vibhag\"). He returned to Satara in 1911 and worked with Dattātraya Baḷavanta Pārasanīs (co-writer with Charles Augustus Kincaid), who wrote \"a history of the maratha people\". The main work was to convert Modi daftar to Marathi/English language.\n\nIn 1939, he met K. B. Hedgewar, the founder of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh at Koregaon during later's visit to Aundh, and joined Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.\nHe also participated in the 1942 Quit India Movement.\n\nApte worked for some time as a co-editor of \"Kirloskar Khabar\" (किर्लोस्कर खबर). He founded a book publishing house, \"Ajinkyatara Pustkalay\", in 1913. He started a literary and political journal named \"Alhad\" (आल्हाद) in 1915 and later, another magazine named \"Madhukar\" (मधुकर). He started a printing press, \"Shriniwas Mudranalay\", in 1920, and he founded the publishing house \"Apte & Co\" in 1924.\n\nApte wrote over providing advice on ways to experiencing happy family life. He also published two collections of his short stories. He propagated traditional Hindu values and beliefs through his writings. His first short story was published in \"Karamanuk\" (करमणूक) magazine which was then edited by Hari Narayan Apte. His first novel \"Ajinkyatara\" (अजिंक्यतारा) was published in 1909. He wrote his last novel \"Javanancha Jiwandharma\" (जवानांचा जीवनधर्म) in 1962.\n\nBaburao Painter in 1925, introduced Apte to Marathi film industry, and Apte wrote screenplays for Marathi films mostly by adapting his own short stories and novels.His most famous works came in the 1930s, Prabhat for Shantaram at the Film Society. He also worked with directors Datta Dharmadhikari, Shantaram Athavale and Dinkar Patil.\n\nApte helped Dadasaheb Phalke during his bad days. He stayed with family at NH Apte's residence at Koregaon village.\n\nHis 80th birthday was celebrated at Koregaon with a group of visiting poets and writers from Pune.\n\nMainly he wrote social, advisory novels and historical novels.\n\nThe following are Apte's novels:\n\n\nThe following is a partial list of Apte's advice books:\n\n\nDuniya Na Mane is a 1937 Hindi social classic based on the Marathi novel, \"Na Patnari Goshta\" (न पटणारी गोष्ट) by Apte, who also wrote the film's screenplay. This film was released on Dussehara in 1937 <http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?edorsup=Sup&wintype=popup&queryed=820043&querypage=1&boxid=27115212&id=29895&eddate=2012-10-21&ed_date=2012-10-21&ed_code=820043> and was shown at the Venice International Film Festival in 1937.\n\nThe movie was remade in Marathi as Kunku.\n\nKunku is the story of a young woman who refuses to accept her marriage with an older man. However, this presents its own problems for the young woman who is now widowed and subject to widowhood, a severe punishment in orthodox Hindu society. The film ends with the husband killing himself to set his wife free of him. Shantaram tells his story as realistically as possible, with background music limited to natural sounds. It was shown at the Venice International Film FestivalThe storyline revolves around a young woman, Nirmala, rebelling against her arranged marriage to a much older widower, Kakasaheb, according to a social practice fairly prevalent in India until the second quarter of the 20th century.\n\nAfter a long discussion with his widowed daughter Sushila, who is roughly Nirmala's age, Kakasaheb agrees to the only way out—suicide—since divorces were not possible in those times. Sushila also provides a forceful feminist speech to the young bride. Just before committing suicide, Kakasaheb implores his would-be wife to find a younger husband.\n\nAn interesting aspect of Duniya Na Mane is its characterisation: The widower is not a villain. He has acted without questioning the prevalent custom of his society and is now faced with the tragic consequences of that act.\n\nBhagyarekha is the story of Manik, a young Gandhian freedom fighter who has a child out of wedlock. Condemned by all the members of her family expect her mother, she battles on steadfastly, even after her lover dies in a police encounter leaving her to fend for herself. The film, directed by Shantaram Athavale, also stars Baburao Pendharkar, and harks back to an era when Marathi cinema tackled unconventional subjects. Keshavrao Bhole composed its music and Narayan Hari Apte wrote the songs, screenplay and dialogues.he wrote it on 1785\n\nRajput Ramani is an adventure movie. The movie shows a medieval Rajput court. The legendary warrior Mansingh (Phatak) is the nation's strong man but he is cordially hated even by his own people. Claiming to have been offended by Taramati (Tarkhad), he insists to her eminent father only a marriage (on terms insulting to her) can placate him. He becomes a dictator imprisoning large numbers of people, and eventually Taramati's father, also in prison, leads a popular revolt, threatening to kill his son-in-law.\n\nHer father has little choice but to comply silently without protest. Mansingh soon evolves into an iron-fisted autocrat—He becomes a tyrant imprisoning large number of the population, including Taramati's father. The old man eventually leads a rebellion that almost kills the muscle-bound tyrant, but Taramati intercedes on behalf of her husband at the last moment.\n\nOn the eve of a big US-Japan trade summit, a reporter gets a hot tip that the Japanese-American head of a big aerospace firm will be selling trade secrets to a Japanese contact. Intent on getting a scoop, the reporter hires private investigator John Blaylock to help her find out just what information is being handed over. In the course of snooping, the pair are discovered, but not before they learn that the Japanese contact is a member of the Yakuza. When the aerospace executive turns up dead after an apparent suicide, the investigators realise that some very big secrets are being kept by some very important people.\n\nAmrit Manthan, which was produced and directed by V. Shantaram. Shantaram used this film to comment subtly on life and times in contemporary society too. He was the first director to use a telephoto lens for his film Amrit Manthan (1934). It uses several film techniques from German Expressionist cinema. Apart from all its notable achievements, this film is best remembered for its shot of the close-up of a priest's right eye. This film is also important for introducing several talented artistes such as Durga Khote and Shanta Apte to a film-hungry audience.\n\nIt tells the story of a very old society where Buddhism goes against orthodox ritualistic practices. This film was set in the Buddhist age and makes a strong statement against the practice of making human sacrifices. Avanti Nagar residents worship Devi Maa Chandika and sacrifice humans and animals to appease her. When Raja Krantivarma bans this sacrifice, his very own Rajguru rebels and incites a group of religious zealots to assassinate him\n"}

It is part of the Austronesian family of languages. The Palauan language is widely used in day-to-day life in Palau.\n\nIt is a member of the Austronesian family of languages, and is one of only two indigenous languages in Micronesia that is not part of the Oceanic branch of that family, the other being Chamorro (see , , , and ).\n\nRoger Blench (2015) notes that based on evidence from fish names, Palauan had early contact with Oceanic languages either directly or indirectly via the Yapese language. These include fish names for the sea eel, yellowfin tuna (\"Thunnus albacares\"), left-eye flounder (\"Bothus mancus\"), triggerfish, sailfish, barracuda (\"Sphyraena barracuda\"), damsel fish (\"Abudefduf\" sp.), squirrelfish (\"Holocentrus\" spp.), unicorn fish (\"Naso\" spp.), trevally, land crab (\"Cardisoma rotundus\"), and wrasse. This suggests that Oceanic speakers had influenced the fishing culture of Palau, and had been fishing and trading in the vicinity of Palau for quite some time. Blench (2015) notes that the Palauan language also displays influence from Central Philippine languages and Samalic languages.\n\nThe phonemic inventory of Palauan consists of 10 consonants and 6 vowels. Phonetic charts of the vowel and consonant phonemes are provided below, utilizing the .\n\nWhile the phonemic inventory of Palauan is relatively small, comparatively, many phonemes contain at least two allophones that surface as the result of various phonological processes within the language. The full phonetic inventory of consonants is given below in (the phonemic inventory of vowels, above, is complete).\n\nPalauan contains several diphthongs (sequences of vowels within a single syllable). A list of diphthongs and corresponding Palauan words containing them are given below, adapted from .\n\nThe extent to which it is accurate to characterize each of these vowel sequences as diphthongs has been a matter of debate, as in , , , and . Nevertheless, a number of the sequences above, such as , clearly behave as diphthongs given their interaction with other aspects of Palauan phonology like stress shift and vowel reduction. Others do not behave as clearly like monosyllabic diphthongs.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Palau Orthography Committee worked with linguists from the University of Hawaii to devise an alphabet based on the Latin script. The resulting orthography was largely based on the \"one phoneme/one symbol\" notion, producing an alphabet of twelve native consonants, six consonants for use in loan words, and ten vowels. The 20 vowel sequences listed under Diphthongs are also all officially recognized in the orthography.\n\nMost of the letters/graphemes in written Palauan correspond to phonemes that can be represented by the corresponding segments in the International Phonetic Alphabet , e.g., Palauan \"b\" is the phoneme . Three notable exceptions are worth mentioning. The first is \"ch\", which is invariably pronounced as a glottal stop . The \"ch\" digraph is a remnant of an earlier writing system developed during German occupation when the glottal stop was pronounced as a fricative . Some older Palauans still remember their grandparents pronouncing \"ch\" this way. In modern Palauan usage the sound has been completely replaced by , but the \"ch\" spelling persists. The second is \"e\", which represents either the full vowel in primary and secondary stressed syllables, or a schwa in unstressed syllables; the conditions are similar to those of English vowel reduction (and note that stress in Palauan is largely penultimate, with many semi-regular exceptions). The third is the digraph \"ng\", which is a (phonemic) velar nasal but can assimilate to be pronounced as or . There is no phonemic in Palauan.\n\nOn May 10, 2007, the Palauan Senate passed Bill No. 7-79, which mandates that educational institutions recognize the Palauan orthography laid out in and . The bill also establishes an Orthography Commission to maintain the language as it develops as well as to oversee and regulate any additions or modifications to the current official orthography.\n\nPalauan nouns inflect based on humanness and number via the plural prefix \"re-\", which attaches to plural human nouns (see ). For example, the word \"chad\" \"person\" is a human noun that is unambiguously singular, whereas the noun \"rechad\" people is a human noun that is unambiguously plural. Non-human nouns do not display this distinction, e.g., the word for stone, \"bad\", can denote either a singular \"stone\" or multiple \"stones.\"\n\nSome possessed nouns in Palauan also inflect to agree with the person, number, and humanness of their possessors. For example, the unpossessed noun \"tebel\" means simply \"table,\" whereas one of its possessed forms \"tebelek\" means \"my table.\" Possessor agreement is always registered via the addition of a suffix to the noun (also triggering a shift in stress to the suffix). The possessor agreement suffixes have many different irregular forms that only attach to particular nouns, and they must be memorized on a noun-by-noun basis . However, there is a \"default\" set (see and ), shown below:\n\nThe word order of Palauan is usually thought to be verb–object–subject (VOS), but this has been a matter of some debate in the linguistic literature. Those who accept the VOS analysis of Palauan word order generally treat Palauan as a pro-drop language with preverbal subject agreement morphemes, final pronominal subjects are deleted (or null).\n\nExample 1: Ak milenga er a ringngo \"pro\". (means: \"I ate the apple.\")\n\nIn the preceding example, the null pronoun \"pro\" is the subject \"I,\" while the clause-initial \"ak\" is the first person singular subject agreement morpheme.\n\nOn the other hand, those who have analyzed Palauan as SVO necessarily reject the pro-drop analysis, instead analyzing the subject agreement morphemes as subject pronouns. In the preceding example, SVO-advocates assume that there is no \"pro\" and that the morpheme \"ak\" is simply an overt subject pronoun meaning \"I.\" One potential problem with this analysis is that it fails to explain why overt (3rd person) subjects occur clause-finally in the presence of a co-referring 3rd person \"subject pronoun\" --- treating the subject pronouns as agreement morphemes circumvents this weakness. Consider the following example.\n\nExample 2: Ng milenga er a ringngo an Olilai. (means: \"Olilai ate the apple.\")\n\nProponents of the SVO analysis must assume a shifting of the subject \"a Alan\" \"Alan\" from clause-initial to clause-final position, a movement operation that has not received acceptance cross-linguistically, but see for discussion.\n\nSome common and useful words and phrases in Palauan are listed below, with their English translations.\n\n1 to 10\n\n\nPalauans have different numbers for different objects. For example, to count people it is: tang, terung, tedei, teuang, teim, telolem, teuid, teai, tetiu, and teruich. Traditionally, there were separate counting sets for people, things, counting, ordinals, bunches of bananas, units of time, long objects, and rafts; however, several of these are no longer used.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24829", "title": "Primitive recursive function", "text": "Primitive recursive function\n\nIn computability theory, primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are defined using composition and primitive recursion – described below – as central operations. They are a strict subset of those µ-recursive functions (also called partial recursive functions) which are also total functions. Primitive recursive functions form an important building block on the way to a full formalization of computability. These functions are also important in proof theory.\n\nMost of the functions normally studied in number theory are primitive recursive. For example, addition and division, the factorial and exponential function, and the function which returns the \"n\"th prime are all primitive recursive. So are many approximations to real-valued functions. In fact, it is difficult to devise a total recursive function that is \"not\" primitive recursive, although some are known (see the section on Limitations below).\nThe set of primitive recursive functions is known as PR in computational complexity theory.\n\nThe primitive recursive functions are among the number-theoretic functions, which are functions from the natural numbers (nonnegative integers) {0, 1, 2, ...} to the natural numbers. These functions take \"n\" arguments for some natural number \"n\" and are called \"n\"-ary.\n\nThe basic primitive recursive functions are given by these axioms:\nMore complex primitive recursive functions can be obtained by applying the operations given by these axioms:\n\nExample. We take \"f\"(\"x\") as the \"S\"(\"x\") defined above. This f is a 1-ary primitive recursive function. And so is \"g\"(\"x\") = \"S\"(\"x\"). So \"h\"(\"x\") defined as \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")) = \"S\"(\"S\"(\"x\")) is a primitive recursive 1-ary function too. Informally speaking, \"h\"(\"x\") is the function that turns \"x\" into \"x\"+2.\n\nExample. Suppose \"f\"(\"x\") = \"P\"(\"x\") = \"x\" and \"g\"(\"x\",\"y\",\"z\")= \"S\"(\"P\"(\"x\",\"y\",\"z\")) = \"S\"(\"y\"). Then \"h\"(0,\"x\") = \"x\" and \"h\"(\"S\"(\"y\"),\"x\") = \"g\"(\"y\",\"h\"(\"y\",\"x\"),\"x\") = \"S\"(\"h\"(\"y\",\"x\")). Now \"h\"(0,1) = 1, \"h\"(1,1) = \"S\"(\"h\"(0,1)) = 2, \"h\"(2,1) = \"S\"(\"h\"(1,1)) = 3. This \"h\" is a 2-ary primitive recursive function. We can call it 'addition'.\n\nThe primitive recursive functions are the basic functions and those obtained from the basic functions by applying these operations a finite number of times.\n\nThe projection functions can be used to avoid the apparent rigidity in terms of the arity of the functions above; by using compositions with various projection functions, it is possible to pass a subset of the arguments of one function to another function. For example, if \"g\" and \"h\" are 2-ary primitive recursive functions then\nis also primitive recursive. One formal definition using projection functions is\n\nIn some settings it is natural to consider primitive recursive functions that take as inputs tuples that mix numbers with truth values (that is \"t\" for true and \"f\" for false), or that produce truth values as outputs. This can be accomplished by identifying the truth values with numbers in any fixed manner. For example, it is common to identify the truth value \"t\" with the number 1 and the truth value \"f\" with the number 0. Once this identification has been made, the characteristic function of a set \"A\", which always returns 1 or 0, can be viewed as a predicate that tells whether a number is in the set \"A\". Such an identification of predicates with numeric functions will be assumed for the remainder of this article.\n\nAn example of a primitive recursive programming language is one that contains basic arithmetic operators (e.g. + and −, or ADD and SUBTRACT), conditionals and comparison (IF-THEN, EQUALS, LESS-THAN), and bounded loops, such as the basic for loop, where there is a known or calculable upper bound to all loops (FOR i FROM 1 to n, with neither i nor n modifiable by the loop body). No control structures of greater generality, such as while loops or IF-THEN plus GOTO, are admitted in a primitive recursive language. Douglas Hofstadter's BlooP in \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" is one such. Adding unbounded loops (WHILE, GOTO) makes the language partially recursive, or Turing-complete; Floop is such, as are almost all real-world computer languages.\n\nArbitrary computer programs, or Turing machines, cannot in general be analyzed to see if they halt or not (the halting problem). However, all primitive recursive functions halt. This is not a contradiction; primitive recursive programs are a non-arbitrary subset of all possible programs, constructed specifically to be analyzable.\n\nMost number-theoretic functions definable using recursion on a single variable are primitive recursive. Basic examples include the addition and truncated subtraction functions.\n\nIntuitively, addition can be recursively defined with the rules:\n\nTo fit this into a strict primitive recursive definition, define:\n\nHere S(\"n\") is \"the successor of \"n\"\" (i.e., \"n\"+1), \"P\" is the identity function, and \"P\" is the projection function that takes 3 arguments and returns the second one. Functions \"f\" and \"g\" required by the above definition of the primitive recursion operation are respectively played by \"P\" and the composition of \"S\" and \"P\".\n\nBecause primitive recursive functions use natural numbers rather than integers, and the natural numbers are not closed under subtraction, a truncated subtraction function (also called \"proper subtraction\") is studied in this context. This limited subtraction function sub(\"a\", \"b\") [or \"b\" ∸ \"a\"] returns \"b\" - \"a\" if this is nonnegative and returns \"0\" otherwise.\n\nThe predecessor function acts as the opposite of the successor function and is recursively defined by the rules:\n\nThese rules can be converted into a more formal definition by primitive recursion:\n\nThe limited subtraction function is definable from the predecessor function in a manner analogous to the way addition is defined from successor:\n\nHere sub(\"a\", \"b\") corresponds to \"b\" ∸ \"a\"; for the sake of simplicity, the order of the arguments has been switched from the \"standard\" definition to fit the requirements of primitive recursion. This could easily be rectified using composition with suitable projections.\n\nExponentiation and primality testing are primitive recursive. Given primitive recursive functions \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", and \"h\", a function that returns the value of \"g\" when \"e\"≤\"f\" and the value of \"h\" otherwise is primitive recursive.\n\nBy using Gödel numberings, the primitive recursive functions can be extended to operate on other objects such as integers and rational numbers. If integers are encoded by Gödel numbers in a standard way, the arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication are all primitive recursive. Similarly, if the rationals are represented by Gödel numbers then the field operations are all primitive recursive.\n\nIn first-order Peano arithmetic, there are infinitely many variables (0-ary symbols) but no k-ary non-logical symbols with k>0 other than S, +, *, and ≤. Thus in order to define primitive recursive functions one has to use the following trick by Gödel.\n\nBy using a Gödel numbering for sequences, for example Gödel's β function, any sequence of numbers can be encoded by a single number. Such a number can therefore represent the primitive recursive function until a given n.\n\nLet \"h\" be a 1-ary primitive recursion function defined by:\nwhere C is a constant and \"g\" is an already defined function.\n\nUsing Gödel's β function, for any sequence of natural numbers (k, k, …, k), there are natural numbers b and c such that, for every i ≤ n, β(b, c, i) = k. We may thus use the following formula to define \"h\"; more precisely, \"m\"=\"h\"(\"n\") is a shorthand for the following:\n\nand the equating to \"g\", being already defined, is in fact shorthand for some other already defined formula (as is β, whose formula is given here).\n\nThe generalization to any k-ary primitive recursion function is trivial.\n\nThe broader class of partial recursive functions is defined by introducing an unbounded search operator. The use of this operator may result in a partial function, that is, a relation with \"at most\" one value for each argument, but does not necessarily have \"any\" value for any argument (see domain). An equivalent definition states that a partial recursive function is one that can be computed by a Turing machine. A total recursive function is a partial recursive function that is defined for every input.\n\nEvery primitive recursive function is total recursive, but not all total recursive functions are primitive recursive. The Ackermann function \"A\"(\"m\",\"n\") is a well-known example of a total recursive function (in fact, provable total), that is not primitive recursive. There is a characterization of the primitive recursive functions as a subset of the total recursive functions using the Ackermann function. This characterization states that a function is primitive recursive if and only if there is a natural number \"m\" such that the function can be computed by a Turing machine that always halts within A(\"m\",\"n\") or fewer steps, where \"n\" is the sum of the arguments of the primitive recursive function.\n\nAn important property of the primitive recursive functions is that they are a recursively enumerable subset of the set of all total recursive functions (which is not itself recursively enumerable). This means that there is a single computable function \"f\"(\"m\",\"n\") that enumerates the primitive recursive functions, namely:\n\"f\" can be explicitly constructed by iteratively repeating all possible ways of creating primitive recursive functions. Thus, it is provably total. One can use a diagonalization argument to show that \"f\" is not recursive primitive in itself: had it been such, so would be \"h\"(\"n\") = \"f\"(\"n\",\"n\")+1. But if this equals some primitive recursive function, there is an \"m\" such that \"h\"(\"n\") = \"f\"(\"m\",\"n\") for all \"n\", and then \"h\"(\"m\") = \"f\"(\"m\",\"m\"), leading to contradiction.\n\nHowever, the set of primitive recursive functions is not the \"largest\" recursively enumerable subset of the set of all total recursive functions. For example, the set of provably total functions (in Peano arithmetic) is also recursively enumerable, as one can enumerate all the proofs of the theory. While all primitive recursive functions are provably total, the converse is not true.\n\nPrimitive recursive functions tend to correspond very closely with our intuition of what a computable function must be. Certainly the initial functions are intuitively computable (in their very simplicity), and the two operations by which one can create new primitive recursive functions are also very straightforward. However, the set of primitive recursive functions does not include every possible total computable function—this can be seen with a variant of Cantor's diagonal argument. This argument provides a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. A sketch of the proof is as follows:\n\nThis argument can be applied to any class of computable (total) functions that can be enumerated in this way, as explained in the article Machines that always halt. Note however that the \"partial\" computable functions (those that need not be defined for all arguments) can be explicitly enumerated, for instance by enumerating Turing machine encodings.\n\nOther examples of total recursive but not primitive recursive functions are known:\n\nIn the following we observe that primitive recursive functions can be of four types:\n\nIn the following the mark \" ' \", e.g. a', is the primitive mark meaning \"the successor of\", usually thought of as \" +1\", e.g. a +1 = a'. The functions 16-20 and #G are of particular interest with respect to converting primitive recursive predicates to, and extracting them from, their \"arithmetical\" form expressed as Gödel numbers.\n\nSimilarly, many of the syntactic results in proof theory can be proved in PRA, which implies that there are primitive recursive functions that carry out the corresponding syntactic transformations of proofs.\n\nIn proof theory and set theory, there is an interest in finitistic consistency proofs, that is, consistency proofs that themselves are finitistically acceptable. Such a proof establishes that the consistency of a theory \"T\" implies the consistency of a theory \"S\" by producing a primitive recursive function that can transform any proof of an inconsistency from \"S\" into a proof of an inconsistency from \"T\". One sufficient condition for a consistency proof to be finitistic is the ability to formalize it in PRA. For example, many consistency results in set theory that are obtained by forcing can be recast as syntactic proofs that can be formalized in PRA.\n\nRecursive definitions had been used more or less formally in mathematics before, but the construction of primitive recursion is traced back to Richard Dedekind's theorem 126 of his \"Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?\" (1888).

The term is often used in describing crustose lichens. A rimose surface of a lichen is sometimes contrasted to the surface being areolate. Areolate is an extreme form of being rimose, where the cracks or fissures are so deep that they create island-like pieces called areoles, which look the \"islands\" of mud on the surface of a dry lake bed. Rimose and areolate are contrasted with being verrucose, or \"warty\". Verrucose surfaces have warty bumps which are distinct, but not separated by cracks.\n"}
{"id": "233152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233152", "title": "Sprechgesang", "text": "Sprechgesang\n\n' (, \"spoken singing\") and ' (, \"spoken voice\") are expressionist vocal techniques between singing and speaking. Though sometimes used interchangeably, \"Sprechgesang\" is directly related to the operatic \"recitative\" manner of singing (in which pitches are sung, but the articulation is rapid and loose like speech), whereas \"Sprechstimme\" is closer to speech itself (because it does not emphasise any particular pitches).\n\n\"Sprechgesang\" is more closely aligned with the long-used musical techniques of \"recitative\" or \"parlando\" than is \"Sprechstimme\". Where the term is employed in this way, it is usually in the context of the late Romantic German operas or \"music dramas\" that were composed by Richard Wagner and others in the 19th century. Thus, \"Sprechgesang\" is often merely a German alternative to \"recitative\".\n\nThe earliest compositional use of the technique was in the first version of Engelbert Humperdinck's 1897 melodrama \"Königskinder\" (in the 1910 version it was replaced by conventional singing), where it may have been intended to imitate a style already in use by singers of lieder and popular song, but it is more closely associated with the composers of the Second Viennese School. Arnold Schoenberg asks for the technique in a number of pieces: the part of the Speaker in \"Gurre-Lieder\" (1911) is written in his notation for \"sprechstimme\", but it was \"Pierrot Lunaire\" (1912) where he used it throughout and left a note attempting to explain the technique. Alban Berg adopted the technique and asked for it in parts of his operas \"Wozzeck\" and \"Lulu\".\n\nIn the foreword to \"Pierrot Lunaire\" (1912), Schoenberg explains how his \"Sprechstimme\" should be achieved. He explains that the indicated rhythms should be adhered to, but that whereas in ordinary singing a constant pitch is maintained through a note, here the singer \"immediately abandons it by falling or rising. The goal is certainly not at all a realistic, natural speech. On the contrary, the difference between ordinary speech and speech that collaborates in a musical form must be made plain. But it should not call singing to mind, either.\"\n\nFor the first performances of \"Pierrot Lunaire\", Schoenberg was able to work directly with the vocalist and obtain exactly the result he desired, but later performances were problematic. Schoenberg had written many subsequent letters attempting to clarify, but he was unable to leave a definitive explanation and there has been much disagreement as to what was actually intended. Pierre Boulez would write, \"the question arises whether it is actually possible to speak according to a notation devised for singing. This was the real problem at the root of all the controversies. Schoenberg's own remarks on the subject are not in fact clear.\"\n\nSchoenberg would later use a notation without a traditional clef in the \"Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte\" (1942), \"A Survivor from Warsaw\" (1947) and his unfinished opera \"Moses und Aron\", which eliminated any reference to a specific pitch, but retained the relative slides and articulations.\n\nIn Schoenberg's musical notation, \"Sprechstimme\" is usually indicated by small crosses through the stems of the notes, or with the note head itself being a small cross.\n\nSchoenberg's later notation (first used in his \"Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte\", 1942) replaced the 5-line staff with a single line having no clef. The note stems no longer bear the \"x\", as it is now clear that no specific pitch is intended, and instead relative pitches are specified by placing the notes above or below the single line (sometimes on ledger lines). \n\nBerg notates several degrees of \"Sprechstimme\", e. g. in \"Wozzeck\", using single-line staff for rhythmic speaking, five-line staffs with x through the note stem, and a single stroke through the stem for close-to-singing \"sprechstimme\".\n\nIn modern usage, it is most common to indicate \"Sprechstimme\" by using \"x\"'s in place of conventional noteheads.\n\n\n"}

He was born early in the century in the region of Salakh to the north-east of Mosul. As a young man he became in 832 a monk of the monastery of Beth 'Abhe, which was situated at the confluence of the Great Zab with one of its tributaries, about 25 miles east of Mosul. A few years later he was acting as secretary to Abraham, who had been abbot of Beth 'Abhe, and was patriarch of the Church of the East from 837 to 850.\n\nAt some date during these 13 years Thomas was promoted by Abraham to be bishop of the diocese of Marga in the same district as Beth 'Abhe, and afterwards he was further advanced to be a metropolitan of Beth Garmai, a district farther to the southeast in the mountains which border the Tigris basin. It was during the period of his life at Beth 'Abhe and his bishopric that he composed \"The Book of Governors\", which is in the main a history of his own monastery, but includes lives of Assyrian Christian holy men in other parts of Mesopotamia and the regions east of the Tigris. The work was probably planned in imitation of the famous \"Paradise\" of Palladius, the history of Egyptian monasticism which had become well known to Syriac-speaking Christians in the version of Anan-Isho (6th century).\n\n\"The Book of Governors\" has been edited with an English translation and a copious introduction by E. W. Budge (2 vols., London, 1893; Google Books), who claims that \"it occupies a unique position in Syriac literature, and it fully deserves the veneration with which it has been and is still regarded by all classes of Assyrians to whom it is known.\" It gives a detailed history of the great monastery cf Beth 'Abhe during its three centuries of existence down to the author's time. It is full of interesting narratives of saintly men told in a naive and candid spirit, and it throws much light on the history of Christianity in the Persian dominions. There is a later edition by P. Bedjan (Paris, 1901).\n"}

Operas in this genre are usually based on stories from Classical mythology or the Italian romantic epics of Tasso and Ariosto. The stories may not have a tragic ending – in fact, they generally don't – but the atmosphere must be noble and elevated. The standard \"tragédie en musique\" has five acts. Earlier works in the genre were preceded by an allegorical prologue and, during the lifetime of Louis XIV, these generally celebrated the king's noble qualities and his prowess in war. Each of the five acts usually follows a basic pattern, opening with an aria in which one of the main characters expresses their feelings, followed by dialogue in recitative interspersed with short arias (\"petits airs\"), in which the main business of the plot occurs. Each act traditionally ends with a \"divertissement\", offering great opportunities for the chorus and the ballet troupe. Composers sometimes changed the order of these features in an act for dramatic reasons.\n\nApart from Lully, the most considerable writer of \"tragédies en musique\" is Rameau, whose five works in the form are considered the culminating masterpieces of the genre. The \"Viking Opera Guide\" refers to Marc-Antoine Charpentier's \"tragédie\" \"Médée\" as \"arguably the finest French opera of the seventeenth century\". In the eighteenth century, Jean-Marie Leclair's lone \"tragédie Scylla et Glaucus\" has been similarly praised. Other highly esteemed exponents are André Campra (\"Tancrède\", \"Idoménée\"), Marin Marais (\"Alcyone\", Sémélé) and Michel Pignolet de Montéclair (\"Jephté\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Singh's contributions were so important and influential that he became canonized as Bhai, an honorific often given to those whom could be considered a saint of the Sikh faith.\n\nBorn in 1872, in Amritsar, Bhai Vir Singh was the eldest of Dr. Charan Singh's three sons. Vir Singh's family could trace its ancestry as far back as to Diwan Kaura Mal, a vice-governor (Maharaja Bahadur) of the city Multan. His grandfather, Kahn Singh (1788-1878), spent a great deal of his youth training and learning traditional Sikh lessons in monasteries. Fluent in Sanskrit and Braj, as well as in the oriental systems of medicine (such as Ayurveda, Siddha and Yunani), Kahn Singh influenced his only son, Dr. Charan Singh, who later fathered Vir Singh, to become an active member of the Sikh community, often producing poetry, music, and writings in hopes of restoring the Sikh community. At seventeen, Bhai Vir Singh himself married Chatar Kaur and had two daughters with her. He died in Amritsar on 10 June 1957.\n\nBhai Vir Singh Ji had the benefit of both the traditional indigenous learning as well as of modern English education. He learnt Sikh scripture as well as Persian, Urdu and Sanskrit. He then joined the Church Mission School, Amritsar and took his matriculation examination in 1891 and stood first all over in the district. Singh received his secondary education at Church Mission High School, and it was while attending school that the conversion of some of his classmates from Sikhism to Christianity that Singh's own religious convictions toward Sikhism were fortified. Influenced by the Christian missionaries' use of and reference to literary sources, Singh got the idea to teach others the main dogmas of Sikhism through his own written resources. Using the skills and techniques in modern literary forms that he learned through his English courses, Singh produced stories, poems, and epics and recorded the history and philosophical ideas of Sikhism.\n\nSingh chose to become a writer. After passing his matriculation examination, he worked with a friend of his father's, Wazir Singh, and set up a lithography press. His first commission to write and print were geography textbooks for some schools.\n\nSingh argued that Sikhism was a unique religion which could be nourished and sustained by creating an awakening amongst the Sikhs of the awareness of their distinct theological and cultural identity. He aimed at reorienting the Sikhs' understanding of their faith in such a manner as to help them assimilate the different modernising influences to their historical memory and cultural heritage. At the time, Sikhs were often persecuted by the British, often being pressured or threatened into assimilating into mainstream culture. Acts such as publicly shaving off the heads and beards of religious Sikh officials were performed to humiliate and demean the Sikh religion. Amidst all this political discontent, Singh sought to revitilize the Sikh culture and religion through peaceful means, by writing a myriad of novels, epics, and poems. With the fall of the Sikh Empire and the modernization of Christian, Muslim, and Hindu movements of proselytism, the Sikh faith began to wane until scholars and theologians of the religions, Singh being a leading one, began revitalizing life into Sikhism through their works of literature.\n\nBhai Vir Singh began taking an interest in the affairs of the Singh sabha movement. To promote its aims and objects, he launched the Khalsa Tract Society in 1894. The tracts produced by the Khalsa Tract Society introduced a new style of literary Punjabi.\n\nThe Khalsa Tract Society periodically made available under the title \"Nirguniara\", low-cost publications on Sikh theology, history and philosophy and on social and religious reform. Through this journal, Singh established contact with an ever-expanding circle of readers. He used the Nirguniara as a vehicle for his own self-expression. Some of his major creative works such as \"Sri Guru Nanak Chamatkar\" and \"Sri Guru Kalgidhar Chamatkar\", were originally serialised in its columns.\n\nIn literature, Singh started as a writer of romances which are considered forerunners of the Punjabi novel. His writings in this genre – \"Sundari\" (1898), \"Bijay Singh\" (1899), \"Satwant Kaur\" (published in two parts, I in 1900 and II in 1927), were aimed at recreating the heroic period (eighteenth century) of Sikh history. Through these novels he made available to his readers, models of courage, fortitude and human dignity. Singh championed the Sikh identity in a way that did not devalue other religions. He even reprimanded the violation and destruction the Hindu idols in Kashmir in his book, \"Avantipur de Khandar\". Singh also criticized and discouraged religious fanaticism, citing those as victims of their own fears brought on by a fervent and obsessive belief.\n\nThe novel \"Subhagji da Sudhar Hathin Baba Naudh Singh\", popularly known as \"Baba Naudh Singh\" (serialised in Nirguniara from 1907 onwards and published in book form in 1921), shares with the epic \"Rana Surat Singh\" (which he had started serialising in 1905) Vir Singh's interest in the theme of a widow's desperate urge for a reunion with her dead husband.\nSoon after the publication of Rana Surat Singh in book form in 1919, he turned to shorter poems and lyrics. These included \"Dil Tarang\" (1920), \"Tarel Tupke\" (1921), \"Lahiran de Har\" (1921), \"Matak Hulare\" (1922), \"Bijlian de Har\" (1927) and \"Mere Sayian Jio\" (1953). Through these works, he paved the way for the emergence of the Punjabi poem.\n\nIn November 1899, he started a Punjabi weekly, the \"Khalsa Samachar\". He revised and enlarged Giani Hazara Singh's dictionary, \"Sri Guru Granth Kosh\", originally published in 1898. The revised version was published in 1927. He published critical editions of some of the old Sikh texts such as \"Sikhan di Bhagat Mala\" (1912), \"Prachin Panth Prakash\" (1914), \"Puratan Janam Sakhi\" (1926) and \"Sakhi Pothi\" (1950).\n\nAn important work was Singh's annotation of Santokh Singh's \"Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth\", published from 1927 to 1935 in fourteen volumes.\n\nUnlike most of the popular religions, Sikhism stresses the equality between men and women and that it is even sinful to consider either sex above the other. Singh reflected this belief in his novels, and featured them in a number of strong female characters. In fact, his very first novel was \"Sundari\", which featured Sunder Kaur, a woman who converted from Hinduism to Sikhism and then proceeded to lead a life of adventure in the jungles with a band of Sikh warriors. It was the first novel penned in the Punjabi language. Through Sundari, Singh hoped to embody all the ideals of Guru Nanak’s lessons. The book was well received by the Sikh community and gained popularity almost immediately. Other important female characters he wrote were Rani Raj Kaur, Satvant Kaur, Subhagji and Sushil Kaur. Even by today's modern standards, these female characters are still considered to be well rounded and an inspiration to both male and female Sikhs alike. Bhai Vir Singh went even as far as often portraying the women in his novels as more prone to spiritual enlightenment than her male counterpart.\n\nBhai Vir Singh was one of the founders of the Punjab & Sind Bank.\n\nHe was honoured with the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1955 and the Padma Bhushan Award in 1956.\n\nThe portion of his commentary on the Adi Granth – nearly one half of the Holy Book – he had completed was published posthumously in seven large volumes.\n\n\n"}

Even before World War II, he had developed his skills as a writer, writing for Dos Yiddish Tagblat and various Agudah periodicals. While still young and single, he was drafted into the Polish army for military training. He lived in Łódź in 1936-1939. Following the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland at the outbreak of World War II he escaped from the Germans to Slonim, which was on the Russian side of the Molotov–Ribbentrop line, eventually entrapped in the Słonim Ghetto after Operation Barbarossa. \nIn 1942 he escaped to the nearby forests and joined the partisans that were fighting the Nazis. He was accepted into the partisan unit because of his earlier training as a soldier and because he possessed an automatic machine gun. After the war he returned to Łódź where he assisted refugees in leaving Europe from his base at 66 Wschodnia Street and then continued his refugee rescue work in Paris from 1946-1950. It was in Paris in 1950 that he published an autobiography of his time fighting as a Jewish partisan under the title \"I Wanted to Live\" (Ich hob gevolt lebn\" in Yiddish), which detailed the dangers he faced not just from the German Nazis, but from his fellow Russian partisans as well. This book was translated into Hebrew and in English under the title \"The War of a Jewish Partisan\". He immigrated to Israel in the 1950s where he continued to write about pre-war Europe and the Holocaust. In Israel he wrote for \"Shearim\", \"Hamodia\", \"HaTzofe\" and other newspapers and journals.
