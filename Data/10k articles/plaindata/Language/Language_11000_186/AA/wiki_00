Together with the ǂHoan language, it forms the proposed Kx'a language family. !Kung constituted one of the branches of the putative Khoisan language family, and was called Northern Khoisan in that scenario, but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is suspected to be spurious. Nonetheless, the term \"Khoisan\" has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.\n\n!Kung is famous for having a large number of clicks, such as the ǃ in its name, and has some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. It also has tone. For a description, see Juǀʼhoansi. To pronounce \"!Xuun\" (pronounced in Western !Kung/!Xuun) one makes a click sound before the \"x\" sound (which is like a Scottish or German \"ch\"), followed by a long nasal \"u\" vowel with a high rising tone.\n\nIf the !Kung languages are counted together, they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous !Kung language, Juǀʼhoan, is perhaps tied for third place with Naro.\n\nEstimates vary, but there are perhaps 14,000–18,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms, interspersed with speakers of other languages, but there are perhaps 9,000 in Namibia, 2,000 in Botswana, 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola (down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975).\n\nUntil the mid–late twentieth century, the ǃʼOǃKung and Maligo dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However, most !Kung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia (primarily to the Caprivi Strip), where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War, more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than a decade living in precarious conditions, the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for a permanent settlement at Platfontein, near Schmidtsdrift.\n\nThe total number of speakers of !Kung languages is around 108,000.\n\nThe better-known !Kung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan, Ekoka !Kung, ǃʼOǃKung, and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects, which may not be mutually intelligible when not adjacent, but there are no clear-cut distinctions between them at our present state of knowledge.\n\nSands et al. classify !Kung varieties into four clusters, with the first two being quite close:\nǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify, but has since been determined to be Southeastern.\n\nHeine & Honken (2010) classify 11 varieties into three branches:\n\nThe ancestral language, Proto-Juu or Proto-!Xuun, had five places of click articulation: Dental, alveolar, palatal, alveolar lateral, and retroflex ( or ). The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan, but remain in Central !Kung. In ǀʼAkhwe (Ekoka), the palatal click has become a fricated alveolar.\n"}

He wrote in Persian language, under the patronage of Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, the founder of the Bahmani Sultanate. He is best known for \"Futuh-us-Salatin\" (c. 1350), a poetic history of the Muslim conquest of India.\n\nIsami was born in 1311, possibly in Delhi. His father's name was 'Izz ul-Din 'Isami. His ancestor Fakhr Malik Isami had migrated from Baghdad to India during the reign of Iltutmish (r. 1211–1236).\n\nIn 1327, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Muhammad bin Tughluq decided to move his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad in Deccan region. Several residents of Delhi, including Isami's family, were ordered to move to Daulatabad. His 90-year-old grandfather died during this journey.\n\nAt Daulatabad, Isami was appalled with what he perceived as Tughluq's misdeeds and tyranny. At one point, he decided to migrate to Mecca, but he was determined to write a history of Muslim rule in India before leaving the country. He aspired to emulate the famous Persian poet Ferdowsi, who wrote \"Shahnameh\", an epic poem outlining the history of Persia.\n\nQazi Bahauddin of Daulatabad introduced him to Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, who had rebelled against Tughluq. Bahman Shah, who established the independent Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan region, became Isami's patron. Isami thus became the earliest panegyrist at the Bahmani court.\n\nUnder the patronage of Bahman Shah, he started writing \"Futuh-us-Salatin\" in 1349. Isami claims to have composed its 12,000 verses in 5 months. According to him, he started writing the book on 10 December 1349, and completed it on 14 May 1350. Nothing is known about Isami's life after this point.\n\nThe \"Futuh-us-Salatin\" (\"Gifts of the Sultans\") is a history of Muslim rule in India until 1349-50. Isami also called it \"Shahnama-i Hind\" (\"the \"Shahnameh\" of India\"). According to Isami, his sources included anecdotes, legends, and reports by his friends and acquaintances. Unlike several earlier chronicles, the book's language is devoid of \"rhetorical artifices and unpleasant exaggeration\".\n\nThe book begins with an account of the conquests of the Ghaznavid ruler Ghazni (r. 998–1002) and the Ghurid ruler Muhammad (r. 1173-1202). It then goes on to narrate the history of the Delhi Sultanate until 1349-50. The book also describes the early years of the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate.\n\n\"Futuh-us-Salatin\" is written in masnavi (rhyming poem) style, and is not fully reliable for the purposes of history. It contains factual mistakes and omits several important events. In addition, Isami implies that the various historical events were pre-determined by divine will and destiny. He believed that the presence of spiritually powerful Sufi leaders affected the fortunes of a kingdom. For example, he attributes to the decline of the Delhi Sultanate to the death of the Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya. Similarly, he claims that the Deccan region prospered because Burhanuddin Gharib and his successor Zainuddin Shirazi lived in Daulatabad.\n\nIsami is highly critical of Muhammad bin Tughluq. On the other hand, he calls his patron Bahman Shah as the rightful caliph. He claims that Tughluq forced the \"entire\" population of Delhi to move to Daulatabad, and that only 10% of the migrants survived the journey. Both these claims appear to be exaggerations. According to Isami, this unfortunate situation was a result of God's punishment to the corrupt Muslims.\n\nDespite these defects, Isami's book is a valuable source of information about the political history and social life of 14th century India.\n\n"}

Ethnologue lists 6500 speakers, but Magomedova and Abulaeva (2007) list 20,000 speakers of the language. Akhvakh has several dialects, though sources do not agree on the number. Ethnologue lists Kaxib, Northern Akhvakh and Southern Akhvakh (which can be further subdivided into the Tlyanub and Tsegob subdialects). Creissels (2010) lists Northern Akhvakh and three dialects of Southern Akhvakh (Cegob, Tljanub, and Ratlub). \n\nA few publications have been made in the Akhvakh language, but for the most part speakers of Akhvakh have adopted Avar as their literary language.\n\nAs with Avar, there are competing analyses of the distinction transcribed in the table with the length sign . Length is part of the distinction, but so is articulatory strength, so they have been analyzed as fortis and lenis. The fortis affricates are long in the fricative part of the contour, e.g. (tss), not in the stop part as in geminate affricates in languages such as Japanese and Italian (tts). Laver (1994) analyzes e.g. as a two-segment affricate–fricative sequence ().\n\nAkhvakh has three agreement classes. In the singular, these are human masculine, human feminine, and non-human. In the plural, there are only two—human plural and non-human plural. Akhvakh verbs agree with the absolutive argument (subject of an intransitive or object of a transitive.)\n\nConsider the following examples, which show the general principles. In the first example, the intransitive verb 'run' shows feminine agreement because its subject, 'girl', is feminine. In the second example, the transitive verb 'cook' shows neuter agreement because its object, 'meat', is neuter. (Creissels 2010:114)\n\nNote that in the second example, 'wife' is in the ergative case and appears to be the subject of both the verbs 'cook' and 'eat', but neither verb shows feminine agreement.\n\nAkhvakh has an ergative-absolutive case-marking system. As the following examples (repeated from above) show, the transitive subject has the ergative case, while an intransitive subject has absolutive case. Absolutive case is not overtly marked by a suffix, but the noun phrase with absolutive case controls agreement on the verb:\n\nIn addition to the ergative and absolutive cases, Akhvakh has eighteen other cases, for a total of twenty cases (Creissels 2010:108-9).

The manuscript is regarded as one of the most important manuscripts of medieval Bulgarian culture. The manuscript, now in the British Library (Add. MS 39627), contains the text of the Four Gospels illustrated with 366 miniatures and consists of 286 parchment folios, 33 by 24.3 cm in size. \n\nBible translations into Modern Bulgarian date from the 1820s and were largely organised by Protestant missionaries. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church initially preferring the continued use of Old Church Slavonic.\n\nThe Archimandrite Theodosius, abbot of the Bistritsa Monastery in Romania, translated the New Testament for the British and Foreign Bible Society, which was printed at St. Petersburg in 1823 . \"It was begun by the Archimandrite Theodosius, with the sanction of Gregory, Patriarch of Constantinople. (St. Matthew's Gospel in Church Slavic and Bulgarian 1823 ) was published by the Russian Bible Society.\" This attempt to translate the Bible into Modern Bulgarian was characterized with poor grammatical style and was greatly influenced by the Church Slavonic version. The entire edition was sent to Saint Petersburg and is said to have been destroyed there. The BFBS had also contracted nationalist journalist Konstantin Fotinov who translated the New Testament but the BFBS did not approve it because \"it was neither Slav[onic] or Bulgarian\".\n\nAn independent attempt to publish a Bulgarian translation of the New Testament occurred in 1828, as Petar Sapunov and his brother Father Serafim published a translation of the four gospels at the Bucharest metropolitan press in Wallachia (Romania). This translation was completed in the Eastern Bulgarian dialect.\n\nIn 1835 Bulgarian monk Neofit Rilski started a new translation of the New Testament. The translation was completed on April 18, 1838. The translation was done in the Bulgarian dialect from the area of Gorna Dzhumaya (present day Blagoevgrad in the region of Macedonia).In 1840 5,000 copies of the first complete translation of the New Testament were printed in Smyrna by the British and Foreign Bible Society. A second edition which was printed in Smyrna in 1850 was an almost exact reprint of the 1840 edition. A third edition followed in 1853 with 15,000 copies. The fourth edition was published in 1857 in Bucharest, and for the first time civil characters type was used. In 1859, two more editions were published. In 1866, a new “pocket” edition with text revised by Elias Riggs and Dr. Albert Long was printed in Constantinople. The New Testament was revised and reprinted a total of nine times.\n\nIn the period from 1840 to 1860 the Eastern (Tarnovo) dialect was adopted as literary Bulgarian language and the Macedonian dialect, in which the New Testament had been translated, was widely rejected. By 1858 Neofit Rilski had finished large portion of the Old Testament. Riggs met with Neofit Rilski and discussed a possible revision of the Bulgarian New Testament to remove the Macedonian dialect elements. Neofit objected the revision, so Riggs took the translation and returned to Constantinople. In January 1859 Riggs invited the Bulgarian teacher Hristodul Kostovich to help him with the revision.\n\nIn 1862 Long and Riggs visited the noted Bulgarian writer and poet Petko Rachov Slaveykov in Tryavna. Slaveykov agreed to help with the translation and began the work on the revising of Neofit’s New Testament at once. Long joined the revision of the New Testament into the Eastern dialect in 1863 and later assisted with the translation of the Old Testament. In June 1871, after more than 12 years of revision and translation, 36,000 copies of the complete Bible translation in Bulgarian were published in Constantinople. The translation came to be known as the Tsarigrad (Constantinople) edition.\n\nThe decision to revise and publish the Bible in the Eastern dialect was the historical factor based on which the Modern Bulgarian language departed from the Macedonian dialect to adopt the Eastern/Thracian dialect.\n\nWith the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, several organizations attempted to provide a new translation of the Bible in Bulgarian. In 1993 a Protestant New Testament was printed. A complete new Orthodox translation was published in 1995, followed by three new Protestant revisions of the Bulgarian Bible in the period of 2000–2001 by publishing houses of Veren (Faithful), Nov Chovek (New Man) and the Bible League.\n\nJáni Vasilčin published in 1998 the New Testament in Banat Bulgarian language. The Banat Bulgarians are a Catholic minority group in western Romania and northeastern Serbia.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses have translated their New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures into Bulgarian.\n\n"}

{"id": "4853498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4853498", "title": "Category management", "text": "Category management\n\nCategory management is a retailing and purchasing concept in which the range of products purchased by a business organization or sold by a retailer is broken down into discrete groups of similar or related products; these groups are known as product categories (examples of grocery categories might be: tinned fish, washing detergent, toothpastes). It is a systematic, disciplined approach to managing a product category as a strategic business unit. The phrase \"category management\" was coined by Brian F. Harris.<ref name=n/a group=n/a></ref>\n\nEach category is run as a \"mini business\" (business unit) in its own right, with its own set of turnover and/or profitability targets and strategies. Introduction of Category Management in a business tends to alter the relationship between retailer and supplier: instead of the traditional adversarial relationship, the relationship moves to one of collaboration, with exchange of information, sharing of data and joint business building.\n\nThe focus of all supplier negotiations is the effect on turnover of the category as whole, not just the sales of individual products. Suppliers are expected, indeed in many cases mandated, to only suggest new product introductions, a new planogram or promotional activity if it is expected to have a beneficial effect on the turnover or profit of the total category and be beneficial to the shoppers of that category.\n\nThe concept originated in grocery (mass merchandising) retailing, and has since expanded to other retail sectors such as DIY, cash and carry, pharmacy, and book retailing.\n\nCategory management lacks a single definition thus leading to some ambiguity even among industry professionals as to its exact function. Three comparative mainstream definitions are as follows:\n\n\"Category management is a process that involves managing product categories as business units and customizing them [on a store by store basis] to satisfy customer needs.\" (Nielsen)\n\n\"The strategic management of product groups through trade partnerships which aims to maximize sales and profit by satisfying consumer and shopper needs\" (Institute of Grocery Distribution)\n\n\".. marketing strategy in which a full line of products (instead of the individual products or brands) is managed as a strategic business unit (SBU).\" (Business Dictionary)\n\nThe Nielsen definition, published in 1992, was a little ahead of its time in that customising product offerings on a store by store basis is logistically difficult and is now not considered a necessary part of category management; it is a concept now referred to as micromarketing. Nevertheless, most grocery retailers will segment stores at least by size, and select product assortments accordingly. Wal*Mart's Store of the Community, implemented in North America, is one of the few examples of where product offerings are tailored right down to the specific store.\n\nOne key reason for the introduction of category management was the retailers' desire for suppliers to add value to their (i.e. the retailer's) business rather than just the supplier's own. For example, in a category containing brands A and B, the situation could arise such that every time brand A promoted its products, the sales of brand B would go down by the amount that brand A would increase, resulting in no net gain for the retailer. The introduction of category management imposed the condition that all actions undertaken, such as new promotions, new products, re-vamped planogram, introduction of point of sale advertising etc. were beneficial to the retailer and the shopper in the store.\n\nA second reason was the realization that only a finite amount of profit could be milked from price negotiations and that there was more profit to be made in increasing the total level of sales.\n\nA third reason was that the collaboration with the supplier meant that supplier's expertise about the market could be drawn upon, and also that a considerable amount of workload in developing the category could be delegated to the supplier.\n\nThe Nielsen definition of a 'category', used as the basic definition across the industry, is that the products should meet a similar consumer need, or that the products should be inter-related or substitutable. The Nielsen definition also includes a provision that products placed together in the same category should be logistically manageable in store (for example there may be issues in having room-temperature and chilled products together in the same category even though the initial two conditions are met).\n\nHowever, this definition does not explain how the process often works in practical retailing situations, where demographic or marketing considerations take precedence.\n\nThe industry standard model for category management in retail is the 8-step process, or 8-step cycle developed by the Partnering Group. The eight steps are shown in the adjacent diagram; they are :\n\nThe 8-step process, whilst being very comprehensive and thorough has been criticized for being rather too unwieldy and time-consuming in today's fast-moving sales environment; in one survey only 9% of supplier companies stated they used the full 8-step process. The current industry trend is for supplier companies to use the standard process as a basis to develop their own more streamlined processes, tailored to their own particular products \n\nMarket research company Nielsen has a similar process based on only 5 steps : reviewing the category, targeting consumers, planning merchandising, implementing strategy, evaluating results.\n\nIt is commonplace for a particular supplier in a category to be nominated by the retailer as a category captain. The category captain will be expected to have the closest and most regular contact with the retailer and will also be expected to invest time, effort, and often financial assets into the strategic development of the category within the retailer. In return, the supplier will gain a more influential voice with the retailer. The category captain is often the supplier with the largest turnover in the category. Traditionally the job of category captain is given to a brand supplier, but in recent times the role has also gone to particularly switched-on private label suppliers. In order to do the job effectively, the supplier may be granted access to a greater wealth of data-sharing, e.g. more access to an internal sales database such as Walmart's Retail Link.\n\nIn the UK, the Groceries Code Adjudicator found in her 2015-16 investigation into Tesco plc that some suppliers paid \"large sums of money in exchange for category captaincy or participation in a price review\". She found some evidence of benefits which suppliers derive from these arrangements but also recorded a concern, to be investigated further, as to whether the purpose of the Groceries Code was being circumvented by these payments.\n\nMany governments have viewed increased collaboration between suppliers and retailers as a potential source of antitrust breaches, such as price fixing. For example the UK Competition Commission has raised their issues on market distortion in principle. They have also acted on milk price-fixing in Britain.\n\nFor MRP-based manufacturing industries, the predominant cost-saving methodology in category management (CM) involves the integration of market intelligence with leveraged spending (for a given category of product or service). In industries where asset operation and preservation bear more significance to the procurement process than do product manufacturing – such as in an MRO environment – demonstrable benefit can still be achieved with category management but is best approached with some manner of adjustment to CM’s usual processes for analysis and strategy development. The first challenge becomes incorporating analytical processes and value drivers that are largely indigenous to the MRP world in a manner that makes sense to an MRO environment. The second (and no less important) challenge becomes avoiding a trap where the CM processes are perceived to be more important than their outcome – a scenario that can result in significant analytical delay, and even complete process paralysis. An excellent example of an MRO environment warranting adjustment to classical category management is nuclear power generation in the United States, where the adjusted approach to category management has been coined \"MCM\" – standing for MRO-based Category Management or Modified Category Management. Not only does electricity generation epitomize an MRO-driven environment, the nuclear energy source adds numerous dimensions of supply and procurement complexity – including federal and state regulatory compliance, nuclear industry standards compliance, nuclear-unique system and component design, and a tightly-audited (and very small) supply base, amongst others. Due to the nature and quantity of discrete characteristics native to nuclear power generation, it can easily be argued that nuclear power generation, in and of itself, should be a distinct category of procurement within a category management project. The fundamental adjustment made between the classical category management approach and the nuclear MCM approach is a shift from procurement strategies focused on leveraged spending to procurement strategies embracing nuclear value drivers, technology innovation, risk management, and strategic sourcing.\n\n\n"}

Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e.g. \"The \"adjective\" \"noun\" \"adverb\" \"verb\" the \"adjective\" \"noun\".\" as in \"The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge.\") or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.\n\nThis technique was invented by surrealists and is similar to an old parlour game called Consequences in which players write in turn on a sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the writing, and then pass it to the next player for a further contribution. Surrealism principal founder André Breton reported that it started in fun, but became playful and eventually enriching. Breton said the diversion started about 1925, but Pierre Reverdy wrote that it started much earlier, at least as early as 1918.\n\nThe name is derived from a phrase that resulted when Surrealists first played the game, \"\" (\"The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine.\") André Breton writes that the game developed at the residence of friends in an old house of Montparnasse at 54 rue du Château (no longer existing). These artists started the movement Yves Tanguy, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Prévert, Benjamin Péret, Pierre Reverdy, and André Breton. Other participants probably included Max Morise, Joan Miró, Man Ray, Simone Collinet, Tristan Tzara, Georges Hugnet, René Char, and Paul and Nusch Éluard.\n\nHenry Miller often partook of the game to pass time in French cafés during the 1930s.\n\nIn a variant now known as picture consequences, instead of sentences, portions of a person were drawn. Later the game was adapted to drawing and collage, producing a result similar to children's books in which the pages were cut into thirds, the top third pages showing the head of a person or animal, the middle third the torso, and the bottom third the legs, with children having the ability to \"mix and match\" by turning pages.\n\nIn the context of parties, it can be run as a circle game in which a group of people cooperatively draw a person, taking about 20 minutes to play.\n\nAn image of a person is drawn in portions, with the paper folded after each portion so that later participants cannot see earlier portions.\nIt has been recommended for use as a tool for teaching about tattoos.\nPicture consequences can be used to practice vocabulary and to encourage a class to work together.\nThe game is also recommended as a \"rainy day\" game. The point of the game is the surprise reveal at the end or for simple fun.\n\nThe person can be drawn in four steps: The head, the torso, the legs and the feet. As a last step, a player may label the drawing, still unseen, with someone's name.\n\nThe name \"picture consequences\" is also sometimes used to describe Telephone Pictionary, a game in which players alternate writing descriptions and matching illustrations based on the previous step.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video game Donner Party, an edited Rom hack of Monster Party, employs this technique by having each stage edited by a different person.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10597", "title": "French language", "text": "French language\n\nFrench ( or ) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages. French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) has largely supplanted. French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to France's past overseas expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages, most notably Haitian Creole. A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French.\n\nFrench is an official language in 29 countries across five different continents, most of which are members of the \"Organisation internationale de la Francophonie\" (OIF), the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French. It is spoken as a first language (in descending order of the number of speakers) in France, Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions, Belgium (Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region), western Switzerland (cantons of Bern, Fribourg, Geneva, Jura, Neuchâtel, Vaud, Valais), Monaco, parts of the United States (Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont), partly in Luxembourg and in northern Italy (region of Aosta Valley), and by various communities elsewhere. In 2015, approximately 40% of the francophone population (including L2 and partial speakers) lived in Europe, 35% in sub-Saharan Africa, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East, 8% in the Americas, and 1% in Asia and Oceania. French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union, Of Europeans who speak other languages natively, approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language. French is the second most taught foreign language in the EU. French is also the 18th most natively spoken language in the world, 6th most spoken language by total number of speakers and the second most studied language worldwide (with about 120 million current learners).\n\nAs a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the 16th century onward, French was introduced to new territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Most second-language speakers reside in Francophone Africa, in particular Gabon, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritius, Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nFrench is estimated to have about 76 million native speakers and about 235 million daily, fluent speakers, and another 77 to 110 million secondary speakers who speak it as a second language to varying degrees of proficiency, mainly in Africa. According to the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), approximately 300 million people worldwide are \"able to speak the language\", without specifying the criteria for this estimation or whom it encompasses. According to a demographic projection led by the Université Laval and the Réseau Démographie de l'Agence universitaire de la francophonie, the total number of French speakers will reach approximately 500 million in 2025 and 650 million by 2050. OIF estimates 700 million by 2050, 80% of whom will be in Africa.\n\nFrench has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary or second language of many international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Olympic Committee, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. In 2011, \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese.\n\nSpoken by 12% of the European Union's population, French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the EU after German, English and Italian; it is also the third-most widely known language of the Union after English and German (33% of the EU population report knowing how to speak English, 22% of Europeans understand German, 20% French).\n\nUnder the Constitution of France, French has been the official language of the Republic since 1992 (although the ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts made it mandatory for legal documents in 1539). France mandates the use of French in official government publications, public education except in specific cases (though these dispositions are often ignored) and legal contracts; advertisements must bear a translation of foreign words.\n\nIn Belgium, French is the official language of Wallonia (excluding a part of the East Cantons, which are German-speaking) and one of the two official languages—along with Dutch—of the Brussels-Capital Region, where it is spoken by the majority of the population often as their primary language.\n\nFrench is one of the four official languages of Switzerland (along with German, Italian, and Romansh) and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland, called Romandy, of which Geneva is the largest city. The language divisions in Switzerland do not coincide with political subdivisions, and some cantons have bilingual status: for example, cities such as Biel/Bienne and cantons such as Valais, Fribourg and Berne. French is the native language of about 23% of the Swiss population, and is spoken by 50.4% of the population.\n\nFrench is also an official language of Monaco and Luxembourg, as well as in the Aosta Valley region of Italy, while French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the Channel Islands. It is also spoken in Andorra and is main communication language after Catalan in El Pas de la Casa. The language is taught as the primary second language in the German \"land\" of Saarland, with French being taught from pre-school and over 43% of citizens being able to speak French.\n\nThe majority of the world's French-speaking population lives in Africa. According to the 2007 report by the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, an estimated 115 million African people spread across 31 Francophone countries can speak French as either a first or a second language. This number does not include the people living in non-Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language. Due to the rise of French in Africa, the total French-speaking population worldwide is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050. French is the fastest growing language on the continent (in terms of either official or foreign languages).\n\nFrench is mostly a second language in Africa, but it has become a first language in some urban areas, such as the region of Abidjan, Ivory Coast and in Libreville, Gabon. There is not a single African French, but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous African languages.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand, because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth. It is also where the language has evolved the most in recent years. Some vernacular forms of French in Africa can be difficult to understand for French speakers from other countries, but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the French-speaking world.\n\nFrench is the second most common language in Canada, after English, and both are official languages at the federal level. It is the first language of 9.5 million people or 29% and the second language for 2.07 million or 6% of the entire population of Canada. French is the sole official language in the province of Quebec, being the mother tongue for some 7 million people, or almost 80% (2006 Census) of the province. About 95% of the people of Quebec speak French as either their first or second language, and for some as their third language. Quebec is also home to the city of Montreal, which is the world's 4th-largest French-speaking city, by number of first language speakers. New Brunswick and Manitoba are the only officially bilingual provinces, though full bilingualism is enacted only in New Brunswick, where about one third of the population is Francophone. French is also an official language of all of the territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon). Out of the three, Yukon has the most French speakers, comprising just under 4% of the population. Furthermore, while French is not an official language in Ontario, the French Language Services Act ensures that provincial services are to be available in the language. The Act applies to areas of the province where there are significant Francophone communities, namely Eastern Ontario and Northern Ontario. Elsewhere, sizable French-speaking minorities are found in southern Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the Port au Port Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the unique Newfoundland French dialect was historically spoken. Smaller pockets of French speakers exist in all other provinces. The city of Ottawa, the Canadian capital, is also effectively bilingual, as it is on the other side of a river from Quebec, opposite the major city of Gatineau, and is required to offer governmental services in French as well as English.\n\nFrench is one of Haiti's two official languages. It is the principal language of writing, school instruction, and administrative use. It is spoken by all educated Haitians and is used in the business sector. It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses. About 70–80% of the country's population have Haitian Creole as their first language; the rest speak French as a first language. The second official language is the recently standardized Haitian Creole, which virtually the entire population of Haiti speaks. Haitian Creole is one of the French-based creole languages, drawing the large majority of its vocabulary from French, with influences from West African languages, as well as several European languages. Haitian Creole is closely related to Louisiana Creole and the creole from the Lesser Antilles.\n\nFrench is the official language of both French Guiana on the South American continent, and of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, an archipelago off the coast of Newfoundland in North America.\n\nFrench was the official language of the colony of French Indochina, comprising modern-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. It continues to be an administrative language in Laos and Cambodia, although its influence has waned in recent years. In colonial Vietnam, the elites primarily spoke French, while many servants who worked in French households spoke a French pidgin known as \"Tây Bồi\" (now extinct). After French rule ended, South Vietnam continued to use French in administration, education, and trade. Since the Fall of Saigon and the opening of a unified Vietnam's economy, French has gradually been effectively displaced as the main foreign language of choice by English. French nevertheless maintains its colonial legacy by being spoken as a second language by the elderly and elite populations and is presently being revived in higher education and continues to be a diplomatic language in Vietnam. All three countries are official members of the OIF.\n\nA former French colony, Lebanon designates Arabic as the sole official language, while a special law regulates cases when French can be publicly used. Article 11 of Lebanon's Constitution states that \"Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used\". French language in Lebanon is widely used as a second language by the Lebanese people, and is taught in many schools as a secondary language along with Arabic and English. The language is also used on Lebanese pound bank notes, on road signs, on Lebanese license plates, and on official buildings (alongside Arabic).\n\nToday, French and English are secondary languages of Lebanon, with about 40% of the population being Francophone and 40% Anglophone. The use of English is growing in the business and media environment. Out of about 900,000 students, about 500,000 are enrolled in Francophone schools, public or private, in which the teaching of mathematics and scientific subjects is provided in French. Actual usage of French varies depending on the region and social status. One third of high school students educated in French go on to pursue higher education in English-speaking institutions. English is the language of business and communication, with French being an element of social distinction, chosen for its emotional value. On social media, French was used on Facebook by just 10% of Lebanese in 2014, far behind English (78%).\n\nA significant French-speaking community is also present in Israel, primarily among the communities of French Jews in Israel, Moroccan Jews in Israel and Lebanese Jews. Many secondary schools offer French as a foreign language.\n\nThe UAE has the status in the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie as an observer state, and Qatar has the status in the organization as an associate state. However, in both countries French is not spoken by almost any of the general population or migrant workers, but spoken by a small minority of those who invest in Francophone countries or have other financial or family ties. Their entrance as observer and associate states respectively into the organisation was aided a good deal by their investments into the Organisation and France itself. A country's status as an observer state in the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie gives the country the right to send representatives to organization meetings and make formal requests to the organization but they do not have voting rights within the OIF. A country's status as an associate state also does not give a country voting abilities but associate states can discuss and review organization matters.\n\nFrench is an official language of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu where 45% of the population can speak French. In the French special collectivity of New Caledonia, 97% of the population can speak, read and write French, whereas only 1% have no knowledge of French. In French Polynesia, 95% of the population can speak, read and write French, whereas only 1.5% have no knowledge of French. In the French collectivity of Wallis and Futuna, 78% of the population can speak, read and write French, whereas 17% have no knowledge of French.\n\n\nFrench is a Romance language (meaning that it is descended primarily from Vulgar Latin) that evolved out of the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. The language's early forms include Old French and Middle French.\n\nDue to Roman rule, Latin was gradually adopted by the inhabitants of Gaul, and as the language was learned by the common people it developed a distinct local character, with grammatical differences from Latin as spoken elsewhere, some of which being attested on graffiti. This local variety evolved into the Gallo-Romance tongues, which include French and its closest relatives, such as Arpitan.\n\nThe Celtic Gaulish language is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization. Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French, with effects including loanwords and calques (including \"oui\", the word for \"yes\"), sound changes shaped by Gaulish influence, and influences in conjugation and word order. Recent computational studies suggest that early gender shifts may have been motivated by the gender of the corresponding word in Gaulish.\n\nThe beginning of French in Gaul was greatly influenced by Germanic invasions into the country. These invasions had the greatest impact on the northern part of the country and on the language there. A language divide began to grow across the country. The population in the north spoke langue d'oïl while the population in the south spoke langue d'oc. Langue d'oïl grew into what is known as Old French. The period of Old French spanned between the 8th and 14th centuries. Old French shared many characteristics with Latin. For example, Old French made use of all possible word orders just as Latin did.\n\nWithin Old French many dialects emerged but the Francien dialect is one that not only continued but also thrived during the Middle French period (14th century–17th century). Modern French grew out of this Francien dialect. Grammatically, during the period of Middle French, noun declensions were lost and there began to be standardized rules. Robert Estienne published the first Latin-French dictionary, which included information about phonetics, etymology, and grammar. Politically, the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts (1539) named French the language of law.\n\nDuring the 17th century, French replaced Latin as the most important language of diplomacy and international relations (lingua franca). It retained this role until approximately the middle of the 20th century, when it was replaced by English as the United States became the dominant global power following the Second World War. Stanley Meisler of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said that the fact that the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as French was the \"first diplomatic blow\" against the language.\n\nDuring the Grand Siècle (17th century), France, under the rule of powerful leaders such as Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIV, enjoyed a period of prosperity and prominence among European nations. Richelieu established the Académie française to protect the French language. By the early 1800s, Parisian French had become the primary language of the aristocracy in France.\n\nNear the beginning of the 19th century, the French government began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minority and regional languages (Patois) spoken in France. This began in 1794 with Henri Grégoire's \"Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language\". When public education was made compulsory, only French was taught and the use of any other (Patois) language was punished. The goals of the Public School System were made especially clear to the French speaking teachers sent to teach students in regions such as Occitania and Brittany: \"And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language\" were instructions given from a French official to teachers in the French \"department\" of Finistère (western Brittany). The prefect of Basses-Pyrénées in the French Basque Country wrote in 1846: \"Our schools in the Basque Country are particularly meant to substitute the Basque language with French...\". Students were taught that their ancestral languages were inferior and they should be ashamed of them; this process was known in the Occitan-speaking region as Vergonha.\n\nAmong the historic reformers of French language, such as Louis Maigret, Marle M., Marcelin Berthelot, Philibert Monet, Jacques Peletier du Mans, Somaize, nowadays the most striking reform is proposed by Mickael Korvin, a Franco-American linguist of Hungarian origin who wants to eliminate accents, silent letters, double letters and more.\n\nSpoken on all continents, French is taught in universities around the world, and is one of the world's most influential languages because of its wide use in the worlds of journalism, jurisprudence, the academy, and diplomacy. \nIn diplomacy, French is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (and one of the UN Secretariat's only two working languages), one of twenty official and three working languages of the European Union, an official language of NATO, the International Olympic Committee, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Organization of American States (alongside Spanish, Portuguese and English), the Eurovision Song Contest, one of eighteen official languages of the European Space Agency, World Trade Organization and the least used of the three official languages in the North American Free Trade Agreement countries. It is also a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the Red Cross (alongside English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Russian), Amnesty International (alongside 32 other languages of which English is the most used, followed by Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian, Médecins sans Frontières (used alongside English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic), and Médecins du Monde (used alongside English). Given the demographic prospects of the French-speaking nations of Africa, \"Forbes\" released an article in 2014 which claimed that French \"could be the language of the future\".\n\nSignificant as a judicial language, French is one of the official languages of such major international and regional courts, tribunals, and dispute-settlement bodies as the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Caribbean Court of Justice, the Court of Justice for the Economic Community of West African States, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea the International Criminal Court and the World Trade Organization Appellate Body. It is the sole internal working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and makes with English the European Court of Human Rights's two working languages.\n\nIn 1997, George Werber published, in \"Language Today\", a comprehensive academic study entitled \"The World's 10 most influential languages\". In the article, Werber ranked French as, after English, the second most \"influential\" language of the world, ahead of Spanish. His criteria were the numbers of native speakers, the number of secondary speakers (especially high for French among fellow world languages), the number of countries using the language and their respective populations, the economic power of the countries using the language, the number of major areas in which the language is used, and the linguistic prestige associated with the mastery of the language (Werber highlighted that French in particular enjoys considerable linguistic prestige). In a 2008 reassessment of his article, Werber concluded that his findings were still correct since \"the situation among the top ten remains unchanged.\"\n\nKnowledge of French is often considered to be a useful skill by business owners in the United Kingdom; a 2014 study found that 50% of British managers considered French to be a valuable asset for their business, thus ranking French as the most-sought after foreign language there, ahead of German (49%) and Spanish (44%). MIT economist Albert Saiz calculated a 2.3% premium for those who have French as a foreign language in the workplace.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, French is the first foreign language taught and in number of pupils is far ahead of other languages. In the United States, Spanish is the most commonly taught foreign language, though French is next.\n\nThe future of the French language is often discussed in the news. For example, in 2014, \"The New York Times\" documented an increase in the teaching of French in New York, especially in dual-language programs where only Spanish and Mandarin are now offered more than French as the second language. A few days later, the linguist John McWhorter launched a frontal attack on the article on his blog at \"The New Republic\". He stressed that learning French in the United States is anchored in an outdated view of French as the most widely spoken language in Europe at a time when U.S. immigration from outside Europe was limited. McWhorter argued that young Americans should learn languages such as Mandarin, Spanish, Arabic or Hindi. However, in a study published in March 2014 by \"Forbes\", the investment bank Natixis said that French could become the world's most spoken language by 2050. It noted that French is spreading in areas where the population is rapidly increasing, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAlthough there are many French regional accents, foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language.\n\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic Latin script, with four diacritics appearing on vowels (circumflex accent, acute accent, grave accent, diaeresis) and the cedilla appearing in \"ç\".\n\nThere are two ligatures, \"œ\" and \"æ\", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed for \"oe\" and \"ae\" in formal and literary texts.\n\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n\nFrench is a morphophonemic language. While it contains 130 graphemes that denote only 36 phonemes, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes. Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one to one correlation from a phoneme to its related grapheme, which can be seen in how \"tomber, tombai,\" and \"tombé\" all end with the /E/ phoneme. Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the \"x\" in \"paix\" is not pronounced though at the end of \"Aix\" it is\".\"\n\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see Liaison (French)). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: \"pied\", \"aller\", \"les\", \"\", \"beaux\". The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: \"beaux-arts\", \"les amis\", \"pied-à-terre\".\n\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for \"animal\" was \"animals\". The sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong . This change was then reflected in the orthography: \"animaus\". The \"us\" ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter \"x\", resulting in a written form \"animax\". As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of \"au\" turned into so that the \"u\" was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French \"animaux\" (pronounced first before the final was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for \"cheval\" pluralized as \"chevaux\" and many others. In addition, \"castel\" pl. \"castels\" became \"château\" pl. \"châteaux\".\n\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.\n\nIn 1990, a reform accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.\n\nFrench is a moderately inflected language. Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); adjectives, for number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns and a few other pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for tense, aspect, mood, and the person and number of their subjects. Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions, while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.\n\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n\nEvery French noun is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is a \"enseignante.\" However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants.\" A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants.\" In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant,\" both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le,\" \"la,\" and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.\n\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the indicative mood (indicatif), the subjunctive mood (subjonctif), the imperative mood (impératif), and the conditional mood (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the infinitive mood (infinitif), the present participle (participe présent), and the past participle (participe passé).\n\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight different tense-aspect forms. These include the present (présent), the simple past (passé composé and passé simple), the past imperfective (imparfait), the pluperfect (plus-que-parfait), the simple future (futur simple), the future perfect (futur antérieur), and the past perfect (passé antérieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the passé composé is used while the passé simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older passé antérieur seen in literary works.\n\nWithin the indicative mood, the passé composé, plus-que-parfait, futur antérieur, and passé antérieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (présent), simple past (passé composé), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the passé composé and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense). The imperative is used to give commands to you (tu), we/us (nous), and plural you (vous).\nThe conditional makes use of the present (présent) and the past (passé).\n\nThe passé uses auxiliary verbs in its forms.\nFrench uses both the active voice and the passive voice. The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb \"être\" (\"to be\") and the past participle.\n\nExample of the active voice:\nExample of the passive voice:\n\nFrench declarative word order is subject–verb–object although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular inversion of the subject and verb like \"Parlez-vous français?\" when asking a question rather than just \"Vous parlez français ?\" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into \"Do you speak French?\" while the second one is literally just \"You speak French?\" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous français ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez français ?\" French also uses verb–object–subject (VOS) and object–subject–verb (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.\n\nThe majority of French words derive from Vulgar Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from Classical Latin. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n\nHowever, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from Vulgar Latin, unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\n\nMore recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules. The result is often two (or more) co-existing terms for describing the same phenomenon. \n\nIt is estimated that 12% (4,200) of common French words found in a typical dictionary such as the \"Petit Larousse\" or \"Micro-Robert Plus\" (35,000 words) are of foreign origin (where Greek and Latin learned words are not seen as foreign). About 25% (1,054) of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings. The others are some 707 words from Italian, 550 from ancient Germanic languages, 481 from other Gallo-Romance languages, 215 from Arabic, 164 from German, 160 from Celtic languages, 159 from Spanish, 153 from Dutch, 112 from Persian and Sanskrit, 101 from Native American languages, 89 from other Asian languages, 56 from other Afro-Asiatic languages, 55 from Slavic languages and Baltic languages, 10 from Basque and 144 (about 3%) from other languages.\n\nOne study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin estimated that among the languages analyzed French has the greatest distance from Latin. Lexical similarity is 89% with Italian, 80% with Sardinian, 78% with Rhaeto-Romance, and 75% with Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nThe French counting system is partially vigesimal: twenty (') is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 80 to 99. The French word for \"80\" is ', literally \"four twenties\", and the word for \"75\" is \"\", literally \"sixty-fifteen\". This reform arose after the French Revolution to unify the different counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via Breton) and Viking influences). This system is comparable to the archaic English use of \"score\", as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\n\nIn Old French (during the Middle Ages), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. \"vint et doze\" (twenty and twelve) for 32, \"dous vinz et diz\" (two twenties and ten) for 50, \"uitante\" for 80, or \"nonante\" for 90.\n\nBelgian French, Swiss French, Aostan French and the French used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi are different in this respect. In the French spoken in these places, 70 and 90 are ' and '. In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be ' (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or ' (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg). \"Octante\" had been used in Switzerland in the past, but is now considered archaic, while in the Aosta Valley 80 is \"\". In Belgium and in its former African colonies, however, \"quatre-vingts\" is universally used.\n\nFrench, like most European languages, uses a space to separate thousands. The comma is used in French numbers as a decimal point, i.e. \"2,5\" instead of \"2.5\".\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10596", "title": "Frisian languages", "text": "Frisian languages\n\nThe Frisian (, also or ) languages are a closely related group of Germanic languages, spoken by about 500,000 Frisian people, who live on the southern fringes of the North Sea in the Netherlands and Germany. The Frisian languages are the closest living language group to the Anglic languages; the two groups make up the Anglo-Frisian languages group. However, modern English and Frisian are not mutually intelligible, nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, due to independent linguistic innovations and foreign influences.\n\nThere are three different Frisian languages: West Frisian, by far the most spoken of the three, is an official language in the Dutch province of Friesland, where it is spoken on the mainland and on two of the West Frisian Islands: Terschelling and Schiermonnikoog. It is also spoken in four villages in the Westerkwartier of the neighbouring province of Groningen. North Frisian is spoken in the northernmost German district of Nordfriesland in the state of Schleswig-Holstein: On the North Frisian mainland, and on the North Frisian Islands of Sylt, Föhr, Amrum, and the Halligen. It is also spoken on the islands of Heligoland and Düne, in the North Sea. The third Frisian language, Saterland Frisian, a variant of East Frisan, is only spoken in four villages in the district of Cloppenburg in the state of Lower Saxony. The four villages of the Saterland/Seelterlound lie just outside the borders of East Frisia, where, apart from German, East Frisian Low Saxon, which is not a Frisian language, but a variant of Low German/Low Saxon, is spoken.\n\nDepending upon their location, the three Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to Dutch and Low German/Low Saxon. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between the Great Yarmouth area and Friesland are likely to have resulted from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long Hanseatic League of the Late Middle Ages.\n\nThere are three varieties of Frisian: West Frisian, Saterland Frisian, and North Frisian. Some linguists consider these three varieties, despite their mutual unintelligibility, to be dialects of one single Frisian language, whereas others consider them to be three separate languages, as do their speakers. West Frisian is strongly influenced by Dutch, and, like Dutch, is described as being \"between\" English and German. The other Frisian languages, meanwhile, have been influenced by Low German and German. The North Frisian language especially is further segmented into several strongly diverse dialects. Stadsfries and West Frisian Dutch are not Frisian, but Dutch dialects influenced by West Frisian. Frisian is called \"Frysk\" in West Frisian, \"Fräisk\" in Saterland Frisian, and \"Frasch\", \"Fresk\", \"Freesk\", and \"Friisk\" in the dialects of North Frisian.\n\nThe situation in the Dutch province of Groningen and the German region of East Frisia is more complex: The local Low German/Low Saxon dialects of Gronings and East Frisian Low Saxon are a mixture of Frisian and Low Saxon dialects; it is believed that Frisian was spoken there at one time, only to have been gradually replaced by Low Saxon. This local language is now, in turn, being replaced by standard Dutch and German.\n\nMost Frisian speakers live in the Netherlands, primarily in the province of Friesland, since 1997 officially using its West Frisian name of Fryslân, where the number of native speakers is about 400,000, which is about 75% of the inhabitants of Friesland. An increasing number of native Dutch speakers in the province are learning Frisian as a second language.\n\nIn Germany, there are about 2,000 speakers of Saterland Frisian in the Saterland region of Lower Saxony; the Saterland's marshy fringe areas have long protected Saterland Frisian speech there from pressure by the surrounding Low German and standard German, but Saterland Frisian still remains seriously endangered because of its exclusion to agrarian community and its lack of a sizable and educated community to help preserve and spread the language.\n\nIn the North Frisia (\"Nordfriesland\") region of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, there were 10,000 North Frisian speakers in the 1970s. Although many of these live on the mainland, most are found on the islands, notably Sylt, Föhr, Amrum, and Heligoland. The local corresponding North Frisian dialects are still in use.\n\nAs a regional language in the Netherlands, West Frisian is only spoken by a certain demographic, specifically rural, lower-income people in contrast with the Dutch speaking upper-class.\n\nWest Frisian-Dutch bilinguals are split into two categories: Speakers who had Dutch as their first language tended to maintain the Dutch system of homophony between plural and linking suffixes when speaking West Frisian, by using the West Frisian plural as a linking morpheme. Speakers who had West Frisian as their first language often maintained the West Frisian system of no homophony when speaking West Frisian.\n\nSpeakers of the many Frisian dialects may also be found in the United States and Canada.\n\nSaterland and North Frisian are officially recognised and protected as minority languages in Germany, and West Frisian is one of the two official languages in the Netherlands, the other being Dutch.\nISO 639-1 code codice_1 and ISO 639-2 code codice_2 were assigned to \"Frisian\", but that was changed in November 2005 to \"Western Frisian\". According to the ISO 639 Registration Authority the \"previous usage of [this] code has been for Western Frisian, although [the] language name was 'Frisian'\".\n\nThe new ISO 639 code codice_3 is used for the Saterland Frisian language, a variety of Eastern Frisian (not to be confused with East Frisian Low Saxon, a West Low German dialect). The new ISO 639 code codice_4 is used for the North Frisian language variants spoken in parts of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe Ried fan de Fryske Beweging is an organization which works for the preservation of the West Frisian language and culture in the Dutch province of Friesland. The Fryske Academy also plays a large role, since its foundation in 1938, to conduct research on Frisian language, history, and society, including attempts at forming a larger dictionary. Recent attempts have allowed Frisian be used somewhat more in some of the domains of education, media and public administration. Nevertheless, Saterland Frisian and most dialects of North Frisian are seriously endangered and West Frisian is considered as vulnerable to being endangered. Moreover, for all advances in integrating Frisian in daily life, there is still a lack of education and media awareness of the Frisian language, perhaps reflecting its rural origins and its lack of prestige Therefore, in a sociological sense it is considered more a dialect than a standard language, even though linguistically it is a separate language.\n\nFor L2 speakers, both the quality and amount of time Frisian is taught in the classroom is low, concluding that Frisian lessons do not contribute meaningfully to the linguistic and cultural development of the students. Moreover, Frisian runs the risk of dissolving into Dutch, especially in Friesland, where both languages are used.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages the Frisian lands stretched from the area around Bruges, in what is now Belgium, to the river Weser, in northern Germany. At that time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. Today this region is sometimes referred to as Great Frisia or Frisia Magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage, even though in most places the Frisian languages have been lost.\n\nFrisian is the language most closely related to English and Scots, but after at least five hundred years of being subject to the influence of Dutch, modern Frisian in some aspects bears a greater similarity to Dutch than to English; one must also take into account the centuries-long drift of English away from Frisian. Thus the two languages have become less mutually intelligible over time, partly due to the marks which Dutch and Low German have left on Frisian, and partly due to the vast influence some languages (in particular Norman French) have had on English throughout the centuries.\n\nOld Frisian, however, was very similar to Old English. Historically, both English and Frisian are marked by the loss of the Germanic nasal in words like \"us\" (\"ús\"; \"uns\" in German), \"soft\" (\"sêft\"; \"sanft\") or \"goose\" (\"goes\"; \"Gans\"): see Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law. Also, when followed by some vowels, the Germanic \"k\" softened to a \"ch\" sound; for example, the Frisian for \"cheese\" and \"church\" is \"tsiis\" and \"tsjerke\", whereas in Dutch it is \"kaas\" and \"kerk\", and in High German the respective words are \"Käse\" and \"Kirche\". Contrarily, this did not happen for \"chin\" and \"choose\", which are \"kin\" and \"kieze\".\n\nOne rhyme demonstrates the palpable similarity between Frisian and English: \"Butter, bread and green cheese is good English and good Frisian,\" which is pronounced more or less the same in both languages (West Frisian: \"Bûter, brea en griene tsiis is goed Ingelsk en goed Frysk.\") \n\nOne major difference between Old Frisian and modern Frisian is that in the Old Frisian period (c.1150-c.1550) grammatical cases still existed. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the 12th or 13th, but most are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, all these texts are restricted to legalistic writings. Although the earliest definite written examples of Frisian are from approximately the 9th century, there are a few examples of runic inscriptions from the region which are probably older and possibly in the Frisian language. These runic writings however usually do not amount to more than single- or few-word inscriptions, and cannot be said to constitute literature as such. The transition from the Old Frisian to the Middle Frisian period (c.1550-c.1820) in the 16th century is based on the fairly abrupt halt in the use of Frisian as a written language.\n\nUp until the 15th century Frisian was a language widely spoken and written, but from 1500 onwards it became an almost exclusively oral language, mainly used in rural areas. This was in part due to the occupation of its stronghold, the Dutch province of Friesland (Fryslân), in 1498, by Duke Albert of Saxony, who replaced West Frisian as the language of government with Dutch.\n\nAfterwards this practice was continued under the Habsburg rulers of the Netherlands (the German Emperor Charles V and his son, the Spanish King Philip II), and even when the Netherlands became independent, in 1585, West Frisian did not regain its former status. The reason for this was the rise of Holland as the dominant part of the Netherlands, and its language, Dutch, as the dominant language in judicial, administrative and religious affairs.\n\nIn this period the great Frisian poet Gysbert Japiks (1603–66), a schoolteacher and cantor from the city of Bolsward, who largely fathered modern West Frisian literature and orthography, was really an exception to the rule.\n\nHis example was not followed until the 19th century, when entire generations of West Frisian authors and poets appeared. This coincided with the introduction of the so-called newer breaking system, a prominent grammatical feature in almost all West Frisian dialects, with the notable exception of Southwest Frisian. Therefore, the Modern West Frisian period is considered to have begun at this point in time, around 1820.\n\nThe revival of the West Frisian Language comes from the poet Gysbert Japiks, who had begun to write in the language as a way to show that it was possible, and created a collective West Frisian identity and West Frisian standard of writing through his poetry. Later on, Johannes Hilarides would build off Gysbert Japik's work by building on West Frisian orthography, particularly on its pronunciation; he also, unlike Japiks, set a standard of the West Frisian language that focused more heavily on how the common people used it as an everyday language.\n\nPerhaps the most important figure in the spreading of the West Frisian language was J. H. Halbertsma (1789–1869), who translated many works into the West Frisian language, such as the New Testament He had however, like Hilarides, focused mostly on the vernacular of the West Frisian language, where he focused on translating texts, plays and songs for the lower and middle classes in order to teach and expand the West Frisian language. This had begun the effort to continuously preserve the West Frisian language, which continues unto this day. It was however not until the first half of the 20th century that the West Frisian revival movement began to gain strength, not only through its language, but also through its culture and history, supporting singing and acting in West Frisian in order to facilitate West Frisian speaking.\n\nIt was not until 1960 that Dutch began to dominate West Frisian in Friesland; with many non-Frisian immigrants into Friesland, the language gradually began to diminish, and only survives now due to the constant effort of scholars and organisations. The province of Friesland rather than the language itself has become in recent years a more important part of West Frisian identity, so the language has become less important for cultural preservation purposes. It is especially written West Frisian that seems to have trouble surviving, with only 30% of the West Frisian population competent in it; it had disappeared in the 16th century and continues to be barely taught today.\n\nFrisian languages belong to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages, the most widespread language family in Europe and the world. Its closest living genealogical relatives are the Anglic languages, i.e. English and Scots; the two groups make up the Anglo-Frisian languages group.\n\n\nNB: * See also West Frisian language#Sample text. ** \"Which\" was changed to \"who\", \"in earth\" to \"on earth,\" and \"them that\" to \"those who\" in the 1928 version of the Church of England prayer book and used in other later Anglican prayer books too.

{"id": "1772673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1772673", "title": "Gay-for-pay", "text": "Gay-for-pay\n\nGay-for-pay describes male or female actors, pornographic stars, or sex workers who identify as heterosexual but who are paid to act or perform as homosexual professionally. The term has also applied to other professions and even companies trying to appeal to a gay demographic. The stigma of being gay or labeled as such has steadily eroded since the Stonewall riots began the modern American gay rights movement in 1969. Through the 1990s, mainstream movie and television actors have been more willing to portray homosexuality, as the threat of any backlash against their careers has lessened and society's acceptance of gay and lesbian people has increased.\n\nIn the gay pornography industry, which uses amateurs as well as professional actors, the term \"gay-for-pay\" refers to actors who identify as straight but who engage in same-sex sexual activities for money or sexual gain. Some actors who are actually gay or bisexual will be marketed as straight to appeal to the \"allure of the unattainable\", because straight men (or those newly coming out) are virgins to sex with other men; scholar Camille Paglia declared that \"Seduction of straight studs is a highly erotic motif in gay porn\" and anthropologist William Leap has similarly written, \"as in most gay male settings, the young, the muscular, and the unfamiliar are more sought.\"\n\nIn gay pornographic movies, actors who identify as straight, but who perform explicit sexual acts with other males, do not face the same stigma as their mainstream acting counterparts and indeed can rise quickly to being featured porn actors. These actors often play the \"top\" roles but this is not always the case, such as with Kristen Bjorn and some Bel Ami models. In some cases, a straight porn actor will shift between gay and straight porn to expand opportunities to work. \n\nBecause some gay men consider heterosexual men to be objects of fantasy, some gay porn producers have almost certainly described some actors as heterosexual to increase sales and publicity for their product. Moreover, many gay or bisexual men who star in gay porn films may wish to be identified publicly as heterosexual for personal or professional reasons.\n\nSome straight actors have started acting in gay porn only to be accused of being gay while others' first step was to strictly do solo masturbation or muscle exhibition scenes. The higher pay scale and profile within a production often leads to group scenes where a straight actor only \"tops\". Many times a \"top\" actor will then be sought as a bottom and the debut is often treated as a notable event or even its own release.\n\nMale pornographic actors are commonly paid more for homosexual work than heterosexual. There are also more opportunities to become a \"star\" in gay porn than in straight porn, where the attention is on female performers.\n\nIn the sex worker industry, the term may also be applied to straight and bisexual people of either gender (including \"male escorts\") who have sexual contact or scenes with a client or another sex worker of the same gender. Although sexual contact is often involved, sex scenes or solo scenes (like masturbating to climax) or even a BDSM scene for the client's stimulation can take place. Sexual arousal without direct sexual contact may also occur in such niche trade like muscle worship. As in porn work, a gay identity is not necessary to make money from gay clients and consumers.\n\nGo-go dancing originated in the 1960s and was eventually appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as \"go-go bars\" but many gay clubs had male go-go dancers (called \"go-go boys\") during the period 1965–1968. After that, few gay clubs had go-go dancers until a resurgence in the late 1980s when go-go dancing again became fashionable (and has remained so ever since). \"Go-go dancers\" that perform at night clubs, special parties, circuit parties or rave dances in colorful bright costumes (which may include battery operated lights), with fire sticks, or with a snake can also be called \"performance art dancers\" or \"box dancers\". Large circuit parties and gay clubs often have very attractive go-go boys of all sexualities who will allow patrons to touch and rub them but only for tips. This is typical in Thai venues, such as in Sunee Plaza, Pattaya. Some criticize the practice of employing straight dancers to perform erotically for gay audiences when gay performers are available.\n\nThe gay community has expressed concerns about the use of straight actors to play gay characters, a practice also nicknamed \"gay for pay\" in the acting industry. This occurs in films such as \"Call Me By Your Name\" (straight actors Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet), \"Brokeback Mountain\" (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), \"Philadelphia\" (starring Tom Hanks), \"Capote\" (starring Philip Seymour Hoffman) and \"Milk\" (with Sean Penn playing the role of the real-life gay rights activist-political leader Harvey Milk). \n\nIn film and TV, \"pinkface\" is the use of straight actors to play LGB roles or characters. Anna King of \"Time Out\" likens \"pinkface\" to blackface. The LGB community raised concerns about the film \"Brüno\", in which a straight actor (Sacha Baron Cohen) plays the role of a gay man to \"...mak[e] fun of the queer community\". Dennis Lim states that the depictions of gays in mainstream film typically include the \"gay joke\" (in which LGB people are depicted to create humor); depicting gay men pejoratively as a \"daisy, a fairy, a nonce, a pansy, a swish\" or showing lesbian woman as \"butch\"; and to create a homosexual panic that plays on heterosexual people's fears of experiencing sexual advances from LGB people (the \"most notorious of all gay-panic movies, William Friedkin's \"Cruising\" (1980)\" links gay men to homicide). Pinkface differs from straightwashing, the erasing of gay characters and themes in film and TV stories.\n\nPinkface in television advertising has also been compared to blackface; similarly to the way 19th century blackface performances created and affirmed a hierarchical system that presented certain identities as \"preferred and privileged\", with pinkface ads, LGBT people are portrayed to create \"humorous stigmatization\" which is \"insidious\", as \"like blackface, pinkface advertisements create a culture that posits the identities of GLBT persons [to a mainly non-GLBT audience] as inferior, inappropriate and ludicrous\". One source called pinkface ads the \"most destructive genre of queer commercials\", as they manipulate queer identities to create stigmatization at gay people's expense and strengthen heteronormative standards. \n\nSome pinkface TV ads depict hairy bearded men in drag (wearing dresses), with the intent of making fun of and devaluing trans women and present a \"campy, stigmatized\" depiction of trans people. Bud Light's 2003 beer commercial \"Clown\" depicts gay men as perverse by showing a man in a clown costume who appears to be walking on his hands, so that his mouth is positioned at the location of his costume's \"bottom\", thus making his drinking of beer look like the bottle is going into his anus, as the \"bar patrons look at...in disgust\", showing that the gay reference is derogatory. In the 2007 Snickers chocolate bar ad \"Chest hair\", two men eat the same chocolate bar and then accidentally end up kissing when they eat the entire bar, causing them to scream and rip out their chest hair, which implies that if two men kiss, they must prove their masculinity with pain-causing \"hypermasculine behavior\", which implies it is \"preferable to physically harm one's self than to be identified as gay\".\n\nGary Nunn of \"The Guardian\", noting that he grew up as a closeted and confused boy, said that while he understands gay people wanting to \"redress the balance\" of \"gay actors hav[ing] been told by Hollywood to stay in the closet if they ever want to play a straight role\" and straight white men having more power and influence and access to better jobs than other people, \"to demand that only gay actors play gay roles is not the way to correct an inequality.\" He believes that \"in a world where gay actors are still denied straight roles, it'll just lead to typecasting of gay actors - the very thing they're wanting to escape. Gay actors want a diversity of roles just like straight actors do.\"\n\n\nA term that is derivative of \"gay-for-pay\" is the partly tongue-in-cheek term \"straight-for-pay\", which describes gay men who have sex with women for pay. The term was coined to describe the film \"\", due to gay porn stars Cameron Marshall and Blake Riley being featured in heterosexual scenes. Other notable examples of gay porn stars going \"straight-for-pay\" are Steven Daigle and Arpad Miklos, the latter of whom received a great deal of criticism for his scene on the site Straight Guys for Gay Eyes (SG4GE). SG4GE's company principal Jake Cruise defended the scene, stating that it was a \"winning idea\" to portray a \"masculine gay man exploring straight sex\" because \"I’ve always loved to push boundaries and press buttons with my work.\"\n\nIn August of 2018, the gay male pornographic website Men.com released its first scene featuring MMF bisexual porn titled \"The Challenge\". Arad Winwin, the star of the scene and a self-identified gay man, faced backlash from fans for acting in the scene, with some fans accusing him of being straight or of having \"converted\" to heterosexual or bisexual. Winwin told the gay website \"Str8UpGayPorn\" that “I’m a gay man...This was only a job, and it was nothing more. Nothing personal. I was working, and it was like any other scene I’ve done.”\n\n"}
{"id": "152567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152567", "title": "Generalized Riemann hypothesis", "text": "Generalized Riemann hypothesis\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis is one of the most important conjectures in mathematics. It is a statement about the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Various geometrical and arithmetical objects can be described by so-called global \"L\"-functions, which are formally similar to the Riemann zeta-function. One can then ask the same question about the zeros of these \"L\"-functions, yielding various generalizations of the Riemann hypothesis. Many mathematicians believe these generalizations of the Riemann hypothesis to be true. The only cases of these conjectures which have been proven occur in the algebraic function field case (not the number field case).\n\nGlobal \"L\"-functions can be associated to elliptic curves, number fields (in which case they are called Dedekind zeta-functions), Maass forms, and Dirichlet characters (in which case they are called Dirichlet L-functions). When the Riemann hypothesis is formulated for Dedekind zeta-functions, it is known as the extended Riemann hypothesis (ERH) and when it is formulated for Dirichlet \"L\"-functions, it is known as the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH). These two statements will be discussed in more detail below. (Many mathematicians use the label \"generalized Riemann hypothesis\" to cover the extension of the Riemann hypothesis to all global \"L\"-functions, \nnot just the special case of Dirichlet \"L\"-functions.)\n\nThe generalized Riemann hypothesis (for Dirichlet \"L\"-functions) was probably formulated for the first time by Adolf Piltz in 1884. Like the original Riemann hypothesis, it has far reaching consequences about the distribution of prime numbers.\n\nThe formal statement of the hypothesis follows. A Dirichlet character is a completely multiplicative arithmetic function \"χ\" such that there exists a positive integer \"k\" with for all \"n\" and whenever . If such a character is given, we define the corresponding Dirichlet \"L\"-function by\n\nfor every complex number \"s\" such that . By analytic continuation, this function can be extended to a meromorphic function defined on the whole complex plane. The generalized Riemann hypothesis asserts that, for every Dirichlet character \"χ\" and every complex number \"s\" with , if \"s\" is not negative real number, then the real part of \"s\" is 1/2.\n\nThe case for all \"n\" yields the ordinary Riemann hypothesis.\n\nDirichlet's theorem states that if \"a\" and \"d\" are coprime natural numbers, then the arithmetic progression \"a\", , , , ... contains infinitely many prime numbers. Let denote the number of prime numbers in this progression which are less than or equal to \"x\". If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then for every coprime \"a\" and \"d\" and for every ,\nwhere \"φ\"(\"d\") is Euler's totient function and \"O\" is the Big O notation. This is a considerable strengthening of the prime number theorem.\n\nIf GRH is true, then every proper subgroup of the multiplicative group formula_3 omits a number less than , as well as a number coprime to \"n\" less than . In other words, formula_3 is generated by a set of numbers less than . This is often used in proofs, and it has many consequences, for example (assuming GRH):\n\nIf GRH is true, then for every prime \"p\" there exists a primitive root mod \"p\" (a generator of the multiplicative group of integers modulo \"p\") that is less than formula_5\n\nGoldbach's weak conjecture also follows from the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The yet to be verified proof of Harald Helfgott of this conjecture verifies the GRH for several thousand small characters up to a certain imaginary part to obtain sufficient bounds that prove the conjecture for all integers above 10, integers below which have already been verified by brute force.\n\nAssuming the truth of the GRH, the estimate of the character sum in the Pólya–Vinogradov inequality can be improved to formula_6, \"q\" being the modulus of the character.\n\nSuppose \"K\" is a number field (a finite-dimensional field extension of the rationals Q) with ring of integers O (this ring is the integral closure of the integers Z in \"K\"). If \"a\" is an ideal of O, other than the zero ideal, we denote its norm by \"Na\". The Dedekind zeta-function of \"K\" is then defined by\nfor every complex number \"s\" with real part > 1.

For a short period he was a teacher in a missionary college on the Gold Coast in West Africa; then in 1932 a mathematics teacher at Llangefni Grammar School, latterly Llangefni County Comprehensive, becoming deputy headmaster until his sudden death.\n\nGeorge Fisher (he preferred his middle name) began writing in English, publishing his first novel, \"One Has Been Honest\", at the age of 21 before his graduation. He wrote many poems and stories, published in \"The Adelphi\" and \"The Twentieth Century\" during the 1930s, before turning to drama. His play \"The Disinherited\" was performed in Swansea's Little Theatre in July 1939.\n\nFisher served in the Navy during World War II as a Lieutenant and, while he was in Iceland, he learned Welsh from Caradar's booklet \"Welsh Made Easy\". From that time, he was intent on writing plays in Welsh, mastering 'cynghanedd'. He wrote at least five short plays between 1945 and 1952 and three long plays: \"Catrin\" (first prize in the National Eisteddfod at Dolgellau, 1949), ' (\"The girl and the wizard\") (which shared first prize in the National Eisteddfod at Rhyl, 1953) and ' (\"Medusa is a girl\"), 1951.\n\nHe also translated Andre Obey's play, \"Noa\" (1951). He produced thirty plays, twenty of these in Welsh, including all his own works and the memorably great productions of the plays of Saunders Lewis. He became a member of the Welsh Arts Council Drama Committee and was awarded the MBE for services to Welsh Theatre in 1958.\n\nHis most important contribution was to ensure that (Llangefni dramatic society) had a permanent home, with the opening of Theatr Fach in Pencraig, Llangefni, on 3 May 1955.

{"id": "2651813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2651813", "title": "Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts", "text": "Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts\n\nMany East Asian scripts can be written horizontally or vertically. Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts can be oriented in either direction, as they consist mainly of disconnected logographic or syllabic units, each occupying a square block of space, thus allowing for flexibility for which direction texts can be written, be it horizontally from left-to-right, horizontally from right-to-left, vertically from top-to-bottom, and even vertically from bottom-to-top. \n\nHorizontal writing is known in Chinese as hengpai (), in Japanese as yokogaki (, \"horizontal writing\", also \"yokogumi\", ), and in Korean as garosseugi () or \"hoengseo\" (; ).\n\nVertical writing is known respectively as zongpai (), tategaki (, \"vertical writing\", also \"tategumi\", ), or serosseugi () or \"jongseo\" (; ).\n\nTraditionally, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are written vertically in columns going from top to bottom and ordered from right to left, with each new column starting to the left of the preceding one. The stroke order and stroke direction of Chinese characters (\"hanzi\" in Chinese, \"kanji\" in Japanese, \"hanja\" in Korean), Japanese kana, and Korean Hangul all facilitate writing in this manner. In addition, writing in vertical columns from right to left facilitated writing with a brush in the right hand while continually unrolling the sheet of paper or scroll with the left. Since the nineteenth century, it has become increasingly common for these languages to be written horizontally, from left to right, with successive rows going from top to bottom, under the influence of European languages such as English, although vertical writing is still frequently used in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nChinese characters, Japanese kana, and Korean hangul can be written horizontally or vertically. There are some small differences in orthography. In horizontal writing it is more common to use Arabic numerals, whereas Chinese numerals are more common in vertical text.\n\nIn these scripts, the positions of punctuation marks, for example the relative position of commas and full stops (periods), differ between horizontal and vertical writing. Punctuation such as the parentheses, quotation marks, book title marks (Chinese), ellipsis mark, dash, wavy dash (Japanese), proper noun mark (Chinese), wavy book title mark (Chinese), emphasis mark, and \"chōon\" mark (Japanese) are all rotated 90 degrees when switching between horizontal and vertical text.\n\nWhere a text is written in horizontal format, pages are read in the same order as English books, with the binding at the left and pages progressing to the right. Vertical books are printed the other way round, with the binding at the right, and pages progressing to the left.\n\nRuby characters, like \"furigana\" in Japanese which provides a phonetic guide for unusual or difficult-to-read characters, follow the direction of the main text. Example in Japanese, with furigana in green:\n\nHowever, \"zhuyin\" in Taiwanese Chinese is usually written vertically regardless of the direction of the main text.\n\nInserted text in the Roman alphabet is usually written horizontally, or turned sideways when it appears in vertical text, with the base of the characters on the left.\n\nHistorically, vertical writing was the standard system, and horizontal writing was only used where a sign had to fit in a constrained space, such as over the gate of a temple or the signboard of a shop. This horizontal writing is in fact a special case of vertical writing in which each column contains just one character.\n\nTherefore, before the end of World War II in Japan, those signs were read right to left.\n\nToday, the left-to-right direction is dominant in all three languages for horizontal writing: this is due partly to the influence of English and other Western languages to make it easier to read when the two languages are found together (for example, on signs at an airport or train station), and partly to the increased use of computerized typesetting and word processing software, most of which does not directly support right-to-left layout of East Asian languages. However, right-to-left horizontal writing is still seen in these scripts, in such places as signs, on the right-hand side of vehicles, and on the right-hand side of stands selling food at festivals. It is also used to simulate archaic writing, for example in reconstructions of old Japan for tourists, and it is still found in the captions and titles of some newspapers.\n\nThe first printed Chinese text in horizontal alignment was Robert Morrison's \"Dictionary of the Chinese language\", published in 1815–1823 in Macau.\n\nThe earliest widely known Chinese publication using horizontal alignment was the magazine \"Science\" (). Its first issue in January 1915 explained the (then) unusual format:\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the occurrence of words in a Western script (predominantly English) became increasingly frequent, and readers began to appreciate the unwieldiness of rotating the paper at each occurrence for vertically set texts. This accelerated acceptance of horizontal writing.\nWith the proliferation of horizontal text, both horizontal and vertical came to be used concurrently. Proponents of horizontal text argued that vertical text in right-to-left columns was smudged easily when written, and moreover demanded greater movement from the eyes when read. Vertical text proponents considered horizontal text to be a break from established tradition.\n\nAfter the success of the communist revolution in 1949, the People's Republic of China decided to use horizontal writing. All newspapers in China changed from vertical to horizontal alignment on January 1, 1956. In publications, text is run horizontally although book titles on spines and some newspaper headlines remain vertical for convenience. Inscriptions of signs on most state organs are still vertical.\n\nIn Singapore, vertical writing has also become rare. In Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and among older overseas Chinese communities, horizontal writing has been gradually adopted since the 1990s. By the early 2000s, most newspapers in these areas had switched to left-to-right horizontal writing, either entirely or in a combination of vertical text with horizontal left-to-right headings.\n\nHorizontal text came into Japanese in the Meiji era, when the Japanese began to print Western language dictionaries. Initially they printed the dictionaries in a mixture of horizontal Western and vertical Japanese text, which meant readers had to rotate the book ninety degrees to read the Western text. Because this was unwieldy, the idea of \"yokogaki\" came to be accepted. One of the first publications to partially use \"yokogaki\" was a German to Japanese dictionary (, \"Shūchinsōzu Dokuwa Jisho\", \"pocket illustrated German to Japanese dictionary\") published in 1885 (Meiji 18).\n\nAt the beginning of the change to horizontal alignment in Meiji era Japan, there was a short-lived form called \"migi yokogaki\" (, literally \"right horizontal writing\"), in contrast to \"hidari yokogaki\", (, literally \"left horizontal writing\"), the current standard. This resembled the right-to-left horizontal writing style of languages such as Arabic with line breaks on the left. It was probably based on the traditional single-row right-to-left writing. This form was widely used for pre-WWII advertisements and official documents (like banknotes), but has not survived outside of old-fashioned signboards.\n\nVertical writing is still commonly used in Japan in novels, newspapers and magazines including the prolific manga comic book genre, while horizontal writing is used more often in other media, especially those containing English language references.\n\nTraditionally, Korean writing has been vertical, with columns running right to left.\n\nIn 1988, The Hankyoreh became the first Korean newspaper to use horizontal writing, and after 1990, all other major newspapers followed suit. Today, major Korean newspapers hardly ever run text vertically.\n\nIn East Asian calligraphy, vertical writing remains the dominant direction.\n\nJapanese comics, also known as manga, tend to use vertical direction for text. Manga frames tend to flow in right-to-left horizontal direction. Frames in yonkoma manga tend to flow in a vertical direction. Page ordering is the same as books that use vertical direction: from right to left. Frames that are chronologically before or after each other use less spacing in between as a visual cue.\n\nMost manga text (dialog and narration) is written vertically, which dictates the vertical shapes of the speech bubbles. Some, however, such as \"Levius\", are aimed at the international market and strive to optimize for translation and localization, therefore make use of horizontal text and speech bubbles. Some authors, such as Kenshi Hirokane, use Japanese text arranged horizontally to imply that a character is actually speaking in a foreign language, like English for example.\n\nIn some cases, horizontal writing in text bubbles may be used to indicate that a translation convention is in use – for example, that a character is actually speaking in English instead of Japanese.\n\nSome publishers that translate manga into European languages may choose to keep the original page order (a notable example is \"Shonen Jump\" magazine), while other publishers may reverse the page flow with use of mirrored pages.\n\nBoth horizontal and vertical writing are used in Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Traditional Chinese is also used in Mainland China in a few limited contexts, such as some books on ancient literature, or as an aesthetic choice for some signs on shops, temples, etc. In those contexts, both horizontal and vertical writing are used as well.\nVertical writing is commonly used for novels, newspapers, comics, and many other forms of writing. Because it goes downwards, vertical writing is invariably used on the spines of books. Some newspapers combine the two forms, using the vertical format for most articles but including some written horizontally, especially for headlines. Musical notation for some Japanese instruments such as the shakuhachi is written vertically.\n\nHorizontal writing is easier for some purposes; academic texts are sometimes written this way since they often include words and phrases in other languages, which are more easily incorporated horizontally. Scientific and mathematical texts are nearly always written horizontally, since in vertical writing equations must be turned sideways, making them more difficult to read.\n\nSimilarly, English language textbooks, which contain many English words, are usually printed in horizontal writing. This is not a fixed rule, however, and it is also common to see English words printed sideways in vertical writing texts.\n\nComputer text is usually presented in horizontal format; see Japanese language and computers.\n\nBusiness cards in Japan (meishi) are often printed vertically in Japanese on one side, and horizontally in English on the other. Postcards and handwritten letters may be arranged horizontally or vertically, but the more formal the letter the more likely it is to be written vertically. Envelope addresses are usually vertical, with the recipient's address on the right and the recipient's name in the exact centre of the envelope. See also Japanese etiquette.\n\nIn mainland China, where the Simplified Chinese orthographical reform has been adopted, vertical writing is now comparatively rare, more so in print than in writing and signage. Most publications are now printed in horizontal alignment, like English. Horizontal writing is written left to right in the vast majority of cases, with a few exceptions such as bilingual dictionaries of Chinese and right-to-left scripts like Arabic, in which case Chinese may follow the right-to-left alignment. Right-to-left writing direction can also often be seen on the right side of tourist buses, as it is customary to have the text run (on both sides of the vehicle) from the front of the bus to its rear.\n\nVertical alignment is generally used for artistic or aesthetic purposes (e.g. on logos and book covers), in scholarly works on Classical Chinese literature, or when space constraints demand it (e.g. on the spines of books and in labelling diagrams). Naturally, vertical text is also used on signs that are longer than they are wide; such signs are the norm at the entrances of schools, government offices and police stations. Calligraphy – in Simplified or Traditional Chinese – is invariably written vertically. Additionally, vertical text may still be encountered on some business cards and personal letters in China.\n\nSince 2012, street markings are written vertically, but unorthodoxically from bottom to top. This is so that the characters are read from nearest to furthest from the drivers' perspective.\n\nIn modern Korea, vertical writing is uncommon. Modern Korean is usually written in left-to-right horizontally. Vertical writing is used when the writing space is long vertically and narrow horizontally. For example, titles on the spines of books are usually written vertically. When a foreign language film is subtitled into Korean, the subtitles are sometimes written vertically at the right side of the screen.\n\nIn the Standard language (; ) of South Korea, punctuation marks are used differently in horizontal and vertical writing. Western punctuation marks are used in horizontal writing and the Japanese/Eastern-style punctuation marks are used in vertical writing. However, vertical writing using Western punctuation marks is sometimes found.\n\nEarly computer installations were designed only to support left-to-right horizontal writing based on the Latin alphabet. Today, most computer programs do not fully support the vertical writing system; however, most advanced word processing and publication software which target the East Asian region support the vertical writing system either fully or to a limited extent.\n\nEven though vertical text display is generally not well supported, composing vertical text for print has been made possible. For example, on Asian editions of Windows, Asian fonts are also available in a vertical version, with font names prefixed by \"@\". Users can compose and edit the document as normal horizontal text. When complete, changing the text font to a vertical font converts the document to vertical orientation for printing purposes. Additionally, OpenType also has codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8 \"feature tags\" to define glyphs that can be transformed or adjusted within vertical text, they can be enabled or disabled in CSS3 using codice_9 property.\n\nSince the late 1990s, W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has been drafting Cascading Style Sheets properties to enable display on the Web of the various languages of the world according to their heritage text directions. Their latest efforts in 2011 show some revisions to the previous format for the Writing Mode property which provides for vertical layout and text display. The format \"writing-mode:tb-rl\" has been revised as \"writing-mode: vertical-rl\" in CSS, but the former syntax was preserved as a part of SVG 1.1 specification.\n\nAmong Web browsers, Internet Explorer is the first one that has been supporting vertical text and layout coded in HTML. Starting with IE 5.5 in 2000, Microsoft has enabled the writing mode property as a \"Microsoft extension to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\". Google Chrome (since 8.0), Safari (since 5.1), Opera (since 15.0) has support the codice_10 property. Mozilla Firefox got support for unprefixed codice_11 property in version 38.0, later enabled by default in version 41.0.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a part of popular depictions of Native Americans in various novels, e.g. those of James Fenimore Cooper or Karl May.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) uses [] (\"how\") for the spelling, and claims Jean de Brébeuf had described the use of the term as an interjection of approval with the Wyandot (Hurons). De Brébeuf described individual speakers using \"Condayauendi Ierhayde cha nonhwicwahachen\" to signify the end of their speaking, which was answered by the community with a long \"Hooow\".\n\nLongman Webster describes \"Howgh\" as a greeting of the Sioux; giving \"Háu kola\" (\"Hallo friend\") as a Lakota Sioux greeting. However, it would be the only Lakota term using a diphthong and is probably of external origin. Dakota and Omaha Sioux use slightly different versions. Francis Parkman, in his book gives a first-person account of three weeks spent hunting buffalo, with a band of Oglala Sioux, in 1846. He mentions their use of \"How\". Today, neither the Hurons nor the Lakota use the term, as by 1900 \"Good morning\" was the preferred greeting.\n\nKarl May uses Howgh similar to the Schweizerdeutsch closing particle \"Ha gschlosse\", which is used by the speaker to indicate they are done speaking. In both cases, the term expresses a strict Rule of Order, and a longing for consensus.\n\n\"Howgh\", \"Uff!\", Manitou and Lakota \"Hoka Hey\" have had a major influence on the popular image of Native Americans in German-speaking countries. \"Howgh\" gained popularity as symbols of Native Americans through Cooper's and Parkman's books. By 1917 it was so stereotypically accepted that it found its way into US World War I propaganda depicting Native American soldiers.By 1953 it was so completely accepted that in Walt Disney's Peter Pan movie, the song \"What Made the Red Man Red?\" uses \"How\" and \"Ugh\" with the strong assumption that the contemporary audience would understand them as standard Native American speech.\n\n\"Howgh\" found some applications in German songs depicting Native Americans, as in \"Indianer\" by Nena (lyrics by Carlo Karges) and Gus Backus \"Da sprach der alte Häuptling der Indianer\" (the old Indian chieftain spoke, covered e.g. by Wildecker Herzbuben and Wirtschaftswunder ). It was even part of the social media parodies of German minister of finance Peer Steinbrück's use of Western movie metaphors against Swiss tax policy 2009. Raymond Steadman was irritated by the usage of what he viewed as a stereotypical phrase, and closed with \"Reader gettum sick? Have-um enough?\"\n\n"}
{"id": "899881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=899881", "title": "Implicate and explicate order", "text": "Implicate and explicate order\n\nImplicate order and explicate order are ontological concepts for quantum theory coined by theoretical physicist David Bohm during the early 1980s. They are used to describe two different frameworks for understanding the same phenomenon or aspect of reality. In particular, the concepts were developed in order to explain the bizarre behavior of subatomic particles – behavior difficult to explain by quantum physics.\n\nIn his book \"Wholeness and the Implicate Order\", Bohm uses these notions to describe how the same phenomenon might look different, or might be characterized by different principal factors, in different contexts such as at different scales. The implicate (also referred to as the \"enfolded\") order is seen as a deeper and more fundamental order of reality. In contrast, the explicate or \"unfolded\" order include the abstractions that humans normally perceive. As he writes:\n\nThe notion of implicate and explicate orders emphasizes the primacy of structure and process over individual objects. The latter are seen as mere approximations of an underlying process. In this approach, quantum particles and other objects are understood to have only a limited degree of stability and autonomy.\n\nBohm believes that the weirdness of the behavior of quantum particles is caused by unobserved forces, maintaining that space and time might actually be derived from an even deeper level of objective reality. In the words of F. David Peat, Bohm considers that what we take for reality are \"surface phenomena, explicate forms that have temporarily unfolded out of an underlying implicate order\". That is, the implicate order is the ground from which reality emerges.\n\nDavid Bohm, his co-worker Basil Hiley, and other physicists of Birkbeck College worked toward a model of quantum physics in which the implicate order is represented in the form of an appropriate algebra or other pregeometry. They considered spacetime itself as part of an explicate order that is connected to an implicate order that they called \"pre-space.\" The spacetime manifold and the properties of locality and nonlocality all arise from an order in such pre-space. A. M. Frescura and Hiley suggested that an implicate order could be carried by an algebra, with the explicate order being contained in the various representations of this algebra. (\"See also:\" Work by Bohm and Hiley on implicate orders, pre-space and algebraic structures.)\n\nIn analogy to Alfred North Whitehead's notion of 'actual occasion',Bohm considered the notion of \"moment\"–a moment being a not entirely localizable event, with events being allowed to overlap  and being connected in an over-all implicate order:\n\nBohm emphasized the primary role of the implicate order's structure:\n\nCentral to Bohm's schema are correlations between observables of entities which seem separated by great distances in the explicate order (such as a particular electron here on earth and an alpha particle in one of the stars in the Abell 1835 galaxy, the farthest galaxy from Earth known to humans), manifestations of the implicate order. Within quantum theory there is entanglement of such objects.\n\nThis view of order necessarily departs from any notion which entails signalling, and therefore causality. The correlation of observables does not imply a causal influence, and in Bohm's schema the latter represents 'relatively' independent events in space-time; and therefore explicate order.\n\nThe implicate order represents the proposal of a general metaphysical concept in terms of which it is claimed that matter and consciousness might both be understood, in the sense that it is proposed that both matter and consciousness: (i) enfold the structure of the whole within each region, and (ii) involve continuous processes of enfoldment and unfoldment. For example, in the case of matter, entities such as atoms may represent continuous enfoldment and unfoldment which manifests as a relatively stable and autonomous entity that can be observed to follow a relatively well-defined path in space-time. In the case of consciousness, Bohm pointed toward evidence presented by Karl Pribram that memories may be enfolded within every region of the brain rather than being localized (for example in particular regions of the brain, cells, or atoms).\n\nBohm went on to say: As in our discussion of matter in general, it is now necessary to go into the question of how in consciousness the explicate order is what is manifest ... the manifest content of consciousness is based essentially on memory, which is what allows such content to be held in a fairly constant form. Of course, to make possible such constancy it is also necessary that this content be organized, not only through relatively fixed association but also with the aid of the rules of logic, and of our basic categories of space, time, causality, universality, etc. ... there will be a strong background of recurrent, stable, and separable features, against which the transitory and changing aspects of the unbroken flow of experience will be seen as fleeting impressions that tend to be arranged and ordered mainly in terms of the vast totality of the relatively static and fragmented content of [memories].\n\nBohm also claimed that \"as with consciousness, each moment has a certain explicate order, and in addition it enfolds all the others, though in its own way. So the relationship of each moment in the whole to all the others is implied by its total content: the way in which it 'holds' all the others enfolded within it\". Bohm characterises consciousness as a process in which at each moment, content that was previously implicate is presently explicate, and content which was previously explicate has become implicate.\n\nOne may indeed say that our memory is a special case of the process described above, for all that is recorded is held enfolded within the brain cells and these are part of matter in general. The recurrence and stability of our own memory as a relatively independent sub-totality is thus brought about as part of the very same process that sustains the recurrence and stability in the manifest order of matter in general. It follows, then, that the explicate and manifest order of consciousness is not ultimately distinct from that of matter in general.\n\nBohm also used the term \"unfoldment\" to characterise processes in which the explicate order becomes relevant (or \"relevated\"). Bohm likens unfoldment also to the decoding of a television signal to produce a sensible image on a screen. The signal, screen, and television electronics in this analogy represent the implicate order while the image produced represents the explicate order. He also uses an example in which an ink droplet can be introduced into a highly viscous substance (such as glycerine), and the substance rotated very slowly such that there is negligible diffusion of the substance. In this example, the droplet becomes a thread which, in turn, eventually becomes invisible. However, by rotating the substance in the reverse direction, the droplet can essentially reform. When it is invisible, according to Bohm, the order of the ink droplet as a pattern can be said to be \"implicate\" within the substance.\n\nIn another analogy, Bohm asks us to consider a pattern produced by making small cuts in a folded piece of paper and then, literally, unfolding it. Widely separated elements of the pattern are, in actuality, produced by the same original cut in the folded piece of paper. Here the cuts in the folded paper represent the implicate order and the unfolded pattern represents the explicate order.\n\nBohm employed the hologram as a means of characterising implicate order, noting that each region of a photographic plate in which a hologram is observable contains within it the whole three-dimensional image, which can be viewed from a range of perspectives. That is, each region contains a whole and undivided image. In Bohm’s words:\n\nBohm noted that although the hologram conveys undivided wholeness, it is nevertheless static.\n\nIn this view of order, laws represent invariant relationships between explicate entities and structures, and thus Bohm maintained that in physics, the explicate order generally reveals itself within well-constructed experimental contexts as, for example, in the sensibly observable results of instruments. With respect to implicate order, however, Bohm asked us to consider the possibility instead \"that physical law should refer primarily to an order of undivided wholeness of the content of description similar to that indicated by the hologram rather than to an order of analysis of such content into separate parts ...\".\n\nIn the work \"Science, Order, and Creativity\" (Bohm and Peat, 1987), examples of implicate orders in science are laid out, as well as implicate orders which relate to painting, poetry and music.\n\nBohm and Peat emphasize the role of orders of varying complexity, which influence the perception of a work of art as a whole. They note that implicate orders are accessible to human experience. They refer for instance to earlier notes which reverberate when listening to music, or various resonances of words and images which are perceived when reading or hearing poetry.\n\nChristopher Alexander discussed his work in person with Bohm, and pointed out connections among his work and Bohm's notion of an implicate order in \"The Nature of Order\".\n\nBohm features as a fictional character in the novel \"The Wave\" by British author Lochlan Bloom. The novel includes multiple narratives and explores many of the concepts of Bohm’s work on implicate and explicate orders.\n\nIn proposing this new notion of order, Bohm explicitly challenged a number of tenets that he believed are fundamental to much scientific work:\n\n\nBohm’s proposals have at times been dismissed largely on the basis of such tenets.\nHis paradigm is generally opposed to reductionism, and some view it as a form of ontological holism. On this, Bohm noted of prevailing views among physicists that \"the world is assumed to be constituted of a set of separately existent, indivisible, and unchangeable 'elementary particles', which are the fundamental 'building blocks' of the entire universe ... there seems to be an unshakable faith among physicists that either such particles, or some other kind yet to be discovered, will eventually make possible a complete and coherent explanation of everything\" ().\n\nIn Bohm’s conception of order, primacy is given to the undivided whole, and the implicate order inherent within the whole, rather than to parts of the whole, such as particles, quantum states, and continua. This whole encompasses all things, structures, abstractions, and processes, including processes that result in (relatively) stable structures as well as those that involve a metamorphosis of structures or things. In this view, parts may be entities normally regarded as physical, such as atoms or subatomic particles, but they may also be abstract entities, such as quantum states. Whatever their nature and character, according to Bohm, these parts are considered in terms of the whole, and in such terms, they constitute relatively separate and independent \"sub-totalities.\" The implication of the view is, therefore, that nothing is \"fundamentally\" separate or independent.\n\n, said: \"The new form of insight can perhaps best be called Undivided Wholeness in Flowing Movement. This view implies that flow is in some sense prior to that of the ‘things’ that can be seen to form and dissolve in this flow.\" According to Bohm, a vivid image of this sense of analysis of the whole is afforded by vortex structures in a flowing stream. Such vortices can be relatively stable patterns within a continuous flow, but such an analysis does not imply that the flow patterns have any sharp division, or that they are literally separate and independently existent entities; rather, they are most fundamentally undivided. Thus, according to Bohm’s view, the whole is in continuous flux, and hence is referred to as the holomovement (movement of the whole).\n\nA key motivation for Bohm in proposing a new notion of order was the well-known incompatibility of quantum theory with relativity theory. summarised the state of affairs he perceived to exist:\n\n...in relativity, movement is continuous, causally determinate and well defined, while in quantum mechanics it is discontinuous, not causally determinate and not well-defined. Each theory is committed to its own notions of essentially static and fragmentary modes of existence (relativity to that of separate events connectible by , and quantum mechanics to a well-defined quantum state). One thus sees that a new kind of theory is needed which drops these basic commitments and at most recovers some essential features of the older theories as abstract forms derived from a deeper reality in which what prevails is unbroken wholeness.\n\nBohm maintained that relativity and quantum theories are in basic contradiction in these essential respects, and that a new concept of order should begin with that toward which both theories point: undivided wholeness. This should not be taken to mean that he advocated such powerful theories be discarded. He argued that each was relevant in a certain context—i.e., a set of interrelated conditions within the explicate order—rather than having unlimited scope, and that apparent contradictions stem from attempts to overgeneralize by superposing the theories on one another, implying greater generality or broader relevance than is ultimately warranted. Thus, argued: \"... in sufficiently broad contexts such analytic descriptions cease to be adequate ... 'the law of the whole' will generally include the possibility of describing the 'loosening' of aspects from each other, so that they will be relatively autonomous in limited contexts ... however, any form of relative (and ) is ultimately limited by holonomy, so that in a broad enough context such forms are seen to be merely aspects, relevated in the holomovement, rather than disjoint and separately existent things in interaction.\"\n\nBefore developing his \"implicit order\" approach, Bohm had proposed a hidden variable theory of quantum physics (see Bohm interpretation). According to Bohm, a key motivation for doing so had been purely to show the possibility of such theories. On this, said, \"... it should be kept in mind that before this proposal was made there had existed the widespread impression that no conception of any hidden variable at all, not even if it were abstract and hypothetical, could possibly be consistent with the quantum theory.\" also claimed that \"the demonstration of the possibility of theories of hidden variables may serve in a more general philosophical sense to remind us of the unreliability of conclusions based on the assumption of the complete universality of certain features of a given theory, however general their domain of validity seems to be.\" Another aspect of Bohm's motivation had been to point out a confusion he perceived to exist in quantum theory. On the dominant approaches in quantum theory, he said: \"...we wish merely to point out that this whole line of approach re-establishes at the abstract level of statistical potentialities the same kind of analysis into separate and autonomous components in interaction that is denied at the more concrete level of individual objects\" ().\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some consider that rather than being a language isolate, Korean forms a small language family, together with Jeju.\n\nAmong extant languages, Korean is considered by most linguists to be a language isolate and by some as part of the widely rejected Altaic family or the Dravido-Korean languages.\nAlexander Vovin (2015) notes that Koreanic shares some typological features with the four Paleosiberian language groups (e.g. lack of phonemic voiced stops, verb compounding, earlier ergativity), and suggests that it actually has more in common with \"Paleosiberian\" (which is a geographical and areal grouping rather a genetic one) than with the putative Altaic group.\n\nKoreanic also has some loanwords from Paleosiberian languages. Vovin notes that Koreanic has some Tungusic loanwords, but is not genetically related to Tungusic.\n\nThe unclassified Khitan language has many similar Korean vocabulary that are not found in Mongolian or Tungusic languages, This suggests a strong Korean presence or that Khitan was in fact a Koreanic or para-Koreanic language.\n\nThe periodization of the historical stages of Korean is as follows:\n\nSeveral ancient languages of the Korean peninsula—Silla, Buyeo, Goguryeo, Dongye, Okjeo, Baekje, Gojoseon and Ye-Maek—may have been ancestral to, related to, or part of Old Korean. Two branches are sometimes posited, Goguryeo and Han.\n\n\nIn ancient times, Koreanic languages, then established in southern Manchuria and the northern Korean peninsula, expanded southward to the central and southern Korean peninsula, displacing the Japonic languages spoken there and possibly causing the Yayoi migrations. There is disagreement over the protohistorical or historical period during which this expansion occurred, ranging from the Korean Bronze Age period to the Three Kingdoms of Korea period.\n\nModern Korean is traditionally considered a single language. However, Jeju (Cheju) is sometimes classified as a distinct language, for example in the UNESCO atlas on endangered languages. If that is accepted, there are two modern Koreanic languages, Jeju and Korean proper.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56166", "title": "Languages in Star Wars", "text": "Languages in Star Wars\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" science fiction universe, created by George Lucas, features dialogue that is not spoken in natural languages. The lingua franca of the franchise, for which the language the works are dubbed or written stand in, is Galactic Basic. Characters often speak languages other than Basic, notably \"Shyriiwook\" spoken by Chewbacca, droidspeak spoken by R2-D2 and BB-8, and Huttese spoken by Jabba the Hutt.\n\nThe fictional languages were approached as sound design and developed largely by Ben Burtt, sound designer for both the original and prequel trilogy of films. He created alien dialogue out of the sounds of primarily non-English languages, such as Quechua, Haya, and Tibetan. This methodology was also used in \"\" by Sara Forsberg. Lucas also insisted that written text throughout the films look as dissimilar from the English alphabet as possible, and constructed alphabets were developed.\n\nThe languages constructed for the films were criticized as not being true constructed languages, instead relying on creating the simple impression of a fully developed language. The usage of heavily accented English for alien characters was also criticized as contributing to the suggestion of racial stereotypes.\n\nLanguage development was approached as sound design and was handled by Ben Burtt, sound designer for both the original and prequel trilogies. He created the alien dialogue out of existing non-English language phrases and their sounds, such as Quechua for Greedo in the original \"Star Wars\" film and Haya for the character Nien Nunb in \"Return of the Jedi\". He also used English, as in the original Star Wars where he synthesized originally English dialogue from a Western film until it sounded alien. Burtt said of the process: \"It usually meant doing some research and finding an existing language or several languages which were exotic and interesting, something that our audience — 99 percent of them — would never understand.\"\n\nThis methodology to create the sound of alien languages was carried into production of \"\". Director J. J. Abrams asked Sara Forsberg, who lacked a professional background in linguistics but created the viral video series \"What Languages Sound Like to Foreigners\" on YouTube, to develop alien dialogue spoken by Indonesian actor Yayan Ruhian. Forsberg was asked to listen to \"Euro-Asian languages\", and she drew from Gujarati, Hindi, and other Asian languages as well as Indonesian and Sundanese, Ruhian's native language. She also listened to languages she did not understand to better structure the words and sentences to sound believable.\n\nDuring production of the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that written text throughout the films look as dissimilar from the English alphabet as possible and strongly opposed English-looking characters in screens and signage. In developing typefaces for use in , including Mandalorian and Geonosian scripts, graphic artist Philip Metschan created alphabets that did not have twenty-six letters like the English alphabet.\n\nGalactic Basic, often simply Basic, is the lingua franca of the \"Star Wars\" universe, for which the language in which the works are dubbed or written acts as a stand-in.\n\nLucas intended to balance American accents and British accents between the heroes and villains of the original film so that each side had each. He also strove to keep accents \"very neutral\", noting Alec Guinness's and Peter Cushing's mid-Atlantic accents and his guidance to Anthony Daniels to speak in an American accent. In critical commentary on , Patricia Williams of \"The Nation\" felt there was a correlation between accent and social class, noting that Jedi speak with \"crisp British accents\" while the women of Naboo and white slaves such as Anakin and Shmi Skywalker \"speak with the brusque, determined innocence of middle-class Americans\".\n\nTo decide on the sound of Nute Gunray, a Neimoidian character portrayed by Silas Carson, Lucas and Rick McCallum listened to actors from different countries reading Carson's lines. Eventually, they chose a heavily Thai-accented English, and Carson rerecorded the dialogue to mimic the Thai actor's accent. Gunray's accent was described by critics to be \"Hollywood Oriental\" that contributed to criticism of Gunray as an Asian stereotype. Watto's accent was similarly criticized as lending to anti-Semitic and anti-Arab connotations.\n\nYoda characteristically speaks a non-standard syntax of Basic, primarily constructing sentences in object-subject-verb word order rare in natural languages. This sentence construction is cited as a \"clever device for making him seem very alien\" and characterizes his dialogue as \"vaguely riddle-like, which adds to his mystique\". This tendency is noted to be written for an English-speaking audience; the word order is retained in Estonian subtitles, where it is grammatical but unusual and emphatic, and Yoda's dialogue is in subject–object–verb word order in Czech dubs.\n\nGungan characters, notably Jar Jar Binks, speak in a heavily accented Basic dialect critics described as a \"Caribbean-flavored pidgin\", \"a pidgin mush of West African, Caribbean and African-American linguistic styles\", \"very like Jamaican patois, albeit a notably reductive, even infantilized sort\", and suggestive of stereotypical African-American culture. This was cited as a trait that led to criticism of the Gungan species as a racially offensive stereotype or caricature.\n\nAurebesh is a writing system used to represent spoken Galactic Basic and is the most commonly seen form of written language in the \"Star Wars\" franchise.\n\nThe alphabet was based on shapes designed by Joe Johnston for the original trilogy, which are briefly featured in screen displays in \"Return of the Jedi\". Johnston's design, called \"Star Wars 76\", was created into a font and again used in \"Attack of the Clones\" by Metschan, who incorporated the font alongside the later Aurebesh version used in the spin-off products.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Stephen Crane, art director at West End Games, became intrigued with the shapes as they appeared on the Death Star. He sought to develop them into an alphabet to be used in West End Games' licensed \"Star Wars\" products, primarily to allow players to render their characters' names, and received permission from Lucasfilm to do so as long as it was presented as one of many alphabets in the \"Star Wars\" galaxy, not the sole and exclusive alphabet. After copying the letters from screenshots by hand, he standardized the letters based on shapes similar to the Eurostile font. He named and assigned a value to each letter, and derived the name \"Aurebesh\" from the names of the first two letters: aurek and besh. Once Crane completed the alphabet, Lucasfilm requested a copy to distribute to other licensees.\n\nIn anticipation of the December 2015 release of \"The Force Awakens\", Google Translate added a feature to render text into Aurebesh in November 2015.\n\nDroidspeak is a language consisting of beeps and other synthesized sounds used by some droid characters, such as R2-D2 and BB-8. Burtt created R2-D2's dialogue in the original \"Star War\"s with an ARP 2600 analog synthesizer and by processing his own vocalizations via other effects. In \"The Force Awakens\", BB-8's dialogue was created by manipulating the voices of Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz with a talkbox running through a sound effects application on an iPad. Although droidspeak is generally unintelligible to the viewing audience, it appears to be understood by characters such as Luke Skywalker.\n\nThe Ewoks of the forest moon of Endor speak a \"primitive dialect\" of one of the more than six million other forms of communication that C-3PO is familiar with. Ben Burtt, \"Return of the Jedi\"’s sound designer, created the Ewok language.\n\nOn the commentary track for the DVD of \"Return of the Jedi\", Burtt identified the language that he heard in the BBC documentary as Kalmyk Oirat, a tongue spoken by the isolated nomadic Kalmyks. He describes how, after some research, he identified an 80-year-old Kalmyk refugee. He recorded her telling folk stories in her native language, and then used the recordings as a basis for sounds that became the Ewok language and were performed by voice actors who imitated the old woman's voice in different styles. For the scene in which C-3PO speaks Ewokese, actor Anthony Daniels worked with Burtt and invented words, based on the Kalmyk recordings.\n\nMarcia Calkovsky of Lethbridge University maintains that Tibetan language contributed to Ewok speech \"along\" with Kalmyk, starting the story from attempts to use language samples of Native Americans and later turning to nine Tibetan women living in San Francisco area, as well as one Kalmyk woman. The story of the choice of these languages is referenced to Burtt's 1989 telephone interview, and many of the used Tibetan phrases translated. The initial prayer Ewoks address to C-3PO is actually the beginning part of Tibetan Buddhist prayer for the benefit of all sentient beings, or so called \"brahmavihāra\"s or \"apramāṇa\"s, but also there is a second (out of four) part of the refuge prayer. People of the Tibetan diaspora were puzzled as many of the phrases they could make out did not correlate to events on screen.\n\nIn the original \"Star Wars\" film, Greedo speaks an unspecified alien language, which is understood by Han Solo. Bruce Mannheim described Greedo as speaking \"morphologically well-formed\" phrases of Southern Quechua, though the sentence is ultimately meaningless. Allen Sonnefrank, a Quechua speaker and linguistic anthropology student at University of California, Berkeley, claimed Lucasfilm contacted him to record Quecha dialogue for the film. Because he was told the dialogue was to be played backward for the film, Sonnefrank refused to record the dialogue, feeling it to be a \"potentially exploitative move best made by one whose first language was Quechua, if at all\".\n\nAnother lingua franca in the \"Star Wars\" Universe that is spoken by many groups and species is Huttese, spoken on Nal Hutta, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and other worlds in and around the Hutt Space (this is the name of the zone, in the galactic West, which is illegally controlled by the Hutts and, in the \"Star Wars Legends\" continuity, covers the dominions of the former Hutt Empire). It is spoken in the films by both non-humans (Jabba the Hutt, Watto, Sebulba and others) and humans. In fact, the whole Max Rebo Band communicates and sings in Huttese. Its phonology is said to be based on the Quechuan languages.\n\nMany Huttese alphabets are featured through the franchise (most notably Boonta alphabet and Nal Huttese), but the one considered \"canonical\" by fans is the one found on promotional Pizza Hut pizza boxes.\n\nThe Jawas, also found on Tatooine, speak in a high-pitched, squeaky voice. To speak to others of their species along with the voice they emit a smell showing their emotions. When trading droids and dealing with non-Jawas they speak without the smell because many consider the smell \"foul\". A famous exclamation in Jawaese is \"Utinni!\", as screamed by a Jawa to the others in \"A New Hope\", shortly after blasting R2-D2.\n\nA written form of the Mandalorian language was developed by Metschan for the display screens of Jango Fett's ship \"Slave I\" in \"Attack of the Clones\", and it was later reused in \"\" and \"Rebels\". Composer Jesse Harlin, needing lyrics for the choral work he wanted for the 2005 \"\" video game, invented a spoken form, intending it to be an ancient language. It was named \"Mando'a\" and extensively expanded by Karen Traviss, author of the \"Republic Commando\" novel series.\n\nMando'a is characterized as a primarily spoken, agglutinative language that lacks grammatical gender in its nouns and pronouns. The language is also characterized as lacking a passive voice, instead primarily speaking in active voice. It is also described as having three grammatical tenses—present, past, and future—but it is said to be often vague and its speakers typically do not use tenses other than the present. The language is described as having a mutually intelligible dialect called \"Concordian\" spoken on the planet Concord Dawn, as stated in Traviss's novels \"Order 66\" and \"501st\", and a dialect spoken on Mandalore's moon Concordia is heard in \"The Mandalore Plot\", a season two episode of \"The Clone Wars\".\n\nThe Sith language, intended to be spoken by Sith characters, was created by Ben Grossblatt for the \"Book of Sith\", published in February 2012. Development on the language and accompanying writing system began in November 2010. Grossblatt sought to create a pronounceable language that was not \"cartoonish\" and \"would conform to the patterns of principles of language. He felt that it needed to \"feel martial and mystical\" and be a \"suitable, aesthetically-pleasing vehicle for communication\". He characterized the sound of the language as \"tough—but not barbarous\" and as \"convey[ing] a kind of confident, elegant cruelty\". To achieve \"formal, quasi-military\" and \"imposing, undeniable\" qualities, he preferred closed syllables, creating brisk and choppy words, and constructed the language as agglutinative.\n\nShyriiwook, also known as Wookieespeak, is a language consisting largely of roars and growls spoken by Wookiee characters, notably Chewbacca. Non-Wookiee characters are capable of understanding Shyriiwook, such as Chewbacca's friend Han Solo. Chewbacca's dialogue was created from recordings of walruses, camels, bears, and badgers from Burtt's personal sound library. One of the most prominent elements was an American black bear living in the Happy Hollow Park & Zoo in San Jose, California. These sounds were mixed in different ratios to create different roars.\n\nThe Tusken Raiders of Tatooine, according to the video game \"Knights of the Old Republic\", speak a language of their own; it is difficult for non-Tuskens to understand this language. In the game, a droid named HK-47 assists the player in communicating with the Tusken Raiders. In the novelizations Junior Jedi Knights and New Jedi Order series, it is revealed that Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila was raised by the Tusken Raiders after they captured her in a raid. Generally, they utter roars and battle cries when seen in public.\n\nUbese is a language heard in \"Return of the Jedi\" during a scene where a disguised Princess Leia bargains with Jabba the Hutt through translator C-3PO. Leia repeats the same Ubese phrase three times, translated differently in subtitles and by C-3PO each time. David J. Peterson, linguist and creator of constructed languages, cited his attempt as a young fan to reconcile this apparent impossibility as an example of how even casual fans may notice errors in fictional constructed languages. He characterized Ubese as a \"sketch\" of a language rather than a fully developed language and categorized it as a \"fake language\" intended to \"give the impression of a real language in some context without actually being a real language\". Ultimately, he criticized Ubese as \"poorly constructed and not worthy of serious consideration\".\n\nBen Zimmer labeled the method of language construction in \"Star Wars\" \"a far cry\" from that of constructed languages like Klingon, Na'vi, and Dothraki, and he described the use of language as \"never amount[ing] to more than a sonic pastiche\".\n\nLinguistic anthropologist Jim Wilce summarized analyses of language in \"Star Wars\" conducted through the Society for Linguistic Anthropology's electronic mailing list. David Samuels described the approach to language as instrumental and compared the films to a Summer Institute of Linguistics convention, in which \"there are no untranslatable phrases, and everyone can understand everyone else\", and pointed out that the \"idea that the Force is something that would be understood differently in the context of different grammars is never broached\". Hal Schiffmann made five observations about language in \"Star Wars\": all humans speak English and no other real-world language, there is \"mutual passive bilingualism\" in which characters speaking different languages understand one another, non-human creatures may have their own languages but are translated by C-3PO, certain non-English vocalizations serve to confuse or amuse the audience rather than serve as language, even non-English speaking characters are expected to understand English. Zimmer supported Schiffmann's claim that untranslated alien languages are not representations of real languages by pointing to the film's script, which describes the language of the Jawas as \"a queer, unintelligible language\" and that of the Tusken Raiders as \"a coarse, barbaric language\". Wilce also pointed out discussion on the usage of real non-English to create the \"Otherness\" of characters such as Jabba the Hutt, Greedo, and the Ewoks.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18372752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18372752", "title": "Lattice mast", "text": "Lattice mast\n\nLattice masts, or cage masts, are a type of observation mast common on major warships in the early 20th century. They are a type of hyperboloid structure, whose weight-saving design was invented by the Russian engineer Vladimir Shukhov. They were used most prominently on American dreadnought battleships and armored cruisers of the World War I era.\n\nIn the age of sail masts were required to support the sails, and lookouts were posted on them; with the advent of engine-powered warships masts were retained and used for observation and to spot fall of shot. The purpose of the lattice structure was to make the posts less vulnerable to shells from enemy ships, and to better absorb the shock caused by firing heavy guns, isolating the delicate fire control equipment (rangefinders, etc.) mounted on the mast tops. However, the masts were found to be easily damaged by the inclement weather experienced at sea by naval ships during typhoons and hurricanes: the s mast was bent right down to the deck by such a storm in 1918. As the caliber and range of ships' guns increased, heavier rangefinders were required. Additionally, the guns and powerful engines created shock and vibrations. Lattice masts were phased out in favor of more rigid tripod masts.\n\nThe s were the first class of American battleships to feature lattice masts, which were to become a standard fixture on all American battleships, and many cruiser classes. Older vessels, including the first modern American battleship, , were modernized with lattice masts during the period.\n\nIn January 1918, the lattice mast of the battleship collapsed in a severe storm; the heavy seas put excessive stress on the mast and the weight of the fire control equipment caused the mast to fail at the narrowest point. The incident spurred an investigation by the Bureau of Construction and Repair, which found that the collapse was in part due to the fact that the mast had been lengthened, with a new section spliced in where the mast broke. In addition, fragments from a recent explosion in one of the ship's guns had damaged the mast, and the damage had not been adequately repaired. Nevertheless, the investigation also found that the mast aboard the battleship also showed signs of buckling. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy repeatedly found evidence of structural problems in the masts, in large part due to the corrosive effects of funnel gases.\n\nAt the same time as the \"Michigan\" incident, US Navy officers were also gaining experience with British tripod masts for the first time while serving with the Grand Fleet during World War I. Unlike lattice masts, the heavier tripods did not suffer from vibration when steaming at high speed, and they were not as susceptible to shock from gunfire, which caused the lattice masts to whip from the concussion.\n\nAll American battleships, up to the battleships were equipped with lattice masts, although in the 1920s to 1930s, the older battleships had their lattice masts replaced with more modern tripod masts, concomitant with the addition of larger, much heavier fire-control director tops. The newer and classes retained their original lattice masts, of heavier construction than those on earlier ships, at the start of World War II.\n\nOnly four battleships were completed with lattice masts for other navies. The two s of the Imperial Russian Navy had lattice masts until they were replaced with conventional masts in the beginning of the First World War. The two United States-built s of the Argentine Navy, ARA Rivadavia and ARA Moreno, had lattice masts. They were the only dreadnought-type battleships built for export by the USA. Two other battleships, the US pre-dreadnoughts \"Mississippi\" and \"Idaho\" were sold to Greece in 1914; they retained their lattice masts until their sinking by the Germans in 1941.\n\nSome navies considered lattice masts for their ships. Following their experience with the \"Andrei Pervozvanny\"s, the Russians initially designed the four s with lattice masts, but constructed with pole ones. The German Imperial Navy designed its first battlecruiser, , with lattice masts, but she was instead completed with pole masts.\n\nA lattice fire-control mast was installed on Fort Drum, a fort built by the United States to guard the entrance of Manila Bay. The mast directed the fire of the fort's 14-inch main batteries.\n\n"}

While Chomsky and other generative grammarians argued that meaning was derived from the underlying order of the words being used, the generative semanticists cited the meaning of the words as giving rise to their order.\n\nEventually, generative semantics spawned an alternative linguistic paradigm, known as cognitive linguistics, which attempts to correlate the understanding of language with the concepts of cognitive psychology, such as memory, perception and categorization. While generative semanticists operate on the premise that the mind has a unique and independent module for language acquisition, cognitive linguists deny this. Instead, they assert that the processing of linguistic phenomena is informed by conceptual deep structures and—more significantly—that the cognitive abilities used to process this data are similar to those used in other non-linguistic tasks.\n\n\"The Linguistics Wars\" is the title of a 1993 book by Randy Allen Harris on the topic ().\n\nIt touches on the issues of the dispute involving Chomsky and other significant individuals (Lakoff, Postal, etc.) and also highlights how certain theories evolved and which of their important features have influenced modern-day linguistic theories.\n\n"}

{"id": "18291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18291", "title": "Luxembourgish", "text": "Luxembourgish\n\nLuxembourgish, Luxemburgish ( ) or Letzeburgesch ( or ) (Luxembourgish: \"Lëtzebuergesch\") is a West Germanic language that is spoken mainly in Luxembourg. About 390,000 people speak Luxembourgish worldwide.\n\nA variety of the Moselle Franconian language, Luxembourgish has similarities with other varieties of Moselle Franconian and the wider group of West Germanic languages. However, the status of Luxembourgish as an official language in Luxembourg and the existence there of a regulatory body, has removed Luxembourgish, at least in part, from the domain of Standard German, its traditional \"Dachsprache\".\n\nLuxembourgish belongs to the West Central German group of High German languages and is the primary example of a Moselle Franconian language.\n\nLuxembourgish is the national language of Luxembourg and one of three administrative languages, alongside French and German.\n\nIn Luxembourg, 50.9% of citizens can speak Luxembourgish. Luxembourgish is also spoken in the Arelerland region of Belgium (part of the Province of Luxembourg) and in small parts of Lorraine in France. \n\nIn the German Eifel and Hunsrück regions, similar local Moselle Franconian dialects of German are spoken. The language is also spoken by a few descendants of Luxembourg immigrants in the United States and Canada.\n\nAdditionally, in the German Eifel and Hunsrück regions, similar local Moselle Franconian dialects of German are spoken. Other Moselle Franconian dialects are spoken by ethnic Germans long settled in Transylvania, Romania (Siebenbürgen).\n\nMoselle Franconian dialects outside the Luxembourg state border tend to have far fewer French loan words, and these mostly remain from the French Revolution.\n\nThere are several distinct dialect forms of Luxembourgish including Areler (from Arlon), Eechternoacher (Echternach), Kliärrwer (Clervaux), Miseler (Moselle), Stater (Luxembourg), Veiner (Vianden), Minetter (Southern Luxembourg) and Weelzer (Wiltz). Further small vocabulary differences may be seen even between small villages.\n\nIncreasing mobility of the population and the dissemination of the language through mass media such as radio and television are leading to a gradual standardisation towards a \"Standard Luxembourgish\" through the process of koineization.\n\nThere is no distinct geographic boundary between the use of Luxembourgish and the use of other closely related High German dialects (for example Lorraine Franconian); it instead forms a dialect continuum of gradual change.\n\nSpoken Luxembourgish is relatively hard to understand for speakers of German who are generally not familiar with Moselle Franconian dialects (or at least other West Central German dialects). However, they can usually read the language to some degree. For those Germans familiar with Moselle Franconian dialects, it is relatively easy to understand and speak Luxembourgish as far as the everyday vocabulary is concerned. However, the large number of French loanwords in Luxembourgish may hamper communication about certain topics, or with certain speakers (who use many French loanwords).\n\nThere is no intelligibility between Luxembourgish and French or any of the Romance dialects spoken in the adjacent parts of Belgium and France.\n\nErna Hennicot-Schoepges, President of the Christian Social People's Party of Luxembourg 1995–2003, was active in promoting the language beyond Luxembourg's borders.\n\nA number of proposals for standardising the orthography of Luxembourgish can be documented, going back to the middle of the 19th century. There was no officially recognised system, however, until the adoption of the \"OLO\" (\"ofizjel lezebuurjer ortografi\") on 5 June 1946. This orthography provided a system for speakers of all varieties of Luxembourgish to transcribe words the way they pronounced them, rather than imposing a single, standard spelling for the words of the language. The rules explicitly rejected certain elements of German orthography (e.g., the use of \"ä\" and \"ö\", the capitalisation of nouns). Similarly, new principles were adopted for the spelling of French loanwords.\nThis proposed orthography, so different from existing \"foreign\" standards that people were already familiar with, did not enjoy widespread approval.\n\nA more successful standard eventually emerged from the work of the committee of specialists charged with the task of creating the \"Luxemburger Wörterbuch\", published in 5 volumes between 1950 and 1977. The orthographic conventions adopted in this decades-long project, set out in Bruch (1955), provided the basis of the standard orthography that became official on 10 October 1975. Modifications to this standard were proposed by the \"Conseil permanent de la langue luxembourgeoise\" and adopted officially in the spelling reform of 30 July 1999. A detailed explanation of current practice for Luxembourgish can be found in Schanen & Lulling (2003).\n\nThe Luxembourgish alphabet consists of the 26 Latin letters plus three letters with diacritics: \"é\", \"ä\", and \"ë\". In loanwords from French and Standard German, other diacritics are usually preserved:\n\nLike many other varieties of Western High German, Luxembourgish has a rule of final \"n\"-deletion in certain contexts. The effects of this rule (known as the \"Eifel Rule\") are indicated in writing, and therefore must be taken into account when spelling words and morphemes ending in or . For example:\n\nThe consonant inventory of Luxembourgish is quite similar to that of Standard German.\n\n\n\n\nLuxembourgish has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and has three cases (nominative, accusative, and dative). These are marked morphologically on determiners and pronouns. As in German, there is no morphological gender distinction in the plural.\nThe forms of the articles and of some selected determiners are given below:\nAs seen above, Luxembourgish has plural forms of \"en\" (\"a, an\"), namely \"eng\" in the nominative/accusative and \"engen\" in the dative. They are not used as indefinite articles, which—as in German and English—do not exist in the plural, but they do occur in the compound pronouns \"wéi en\" (\"what, which\") and \"sou en\" (\"such\"). For example: \"wéi eng Saachen\" (\"what things\"); \"sou eng Saachen\" (\"such things\"). Moreover, they are used before numbers to express an estimation: \"eng 30.000 Spectateuren\" (\"some 30,000 spectators\").\n\nDistinct nominative forms survive in a few nominal phrases such as \"der Däiwel\" (\"the devil\") and \"eiser Herrgott\" (\"our Lord\"). Rare examples of the genitive are also found: \"Enn des Mounts\" (\"end of the month\"), \"Ufanks der Woch\" (\"at the beginning of the week\"). The functions of the genitive are normally expressed using a combination of the dative and a possessive determiner: e.g. \"dem Mann säi Buch\" (lit. \"to the man his book\", i.e. \"the man's book\"). This is known as a periphrastic genitive, and is a phenomenon also commonly seen in dialectal and colloquial German, and in Dutch.\n\nThe forms of the personal pronouns are given in the following table (unstressed forms appear in parentheses):\n\nThe 2pl form is also used as a polite singular (like French \"vous\", see T-V distinction); the forms are capitalised in writing:\n\nLike most varieties of colloquial German, but even more invariably, Luxembourgish uses definite articles with personal names. They are obligatory and not to be translated:\n\nA feature Luxembourgish shares with only some western dialects of German is that women and girls are most often referred to with forms of the \"neuter\" pronoun \"hatt\":\n\nLuxembourgish morphology distinguishes two types of adjective: attributive and predicative. Predicative adjectives appear with verbs like \"sinn\" (\"to be\"), and receive no extra ending:\n\nAttributive adjectives are placed before the noun they describe, and change their ending according to the grammatical gender, number, and case:\n\nCuriously, the definite article changes with the use of an attributive adjective: feminine \"d\" goes to \"déi\" (or \"di\"), neuter \"d<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" goes to \"dat\", and plural \"d<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" changes to \"déi\".\n\nThe comparative in Luxembourgish is formed analytically, i.e. the adjective itself is not altered (compare the use of -\"er\" in German and English; \"tall\" → \"taller\", \"klein\" → \"kleiner\"). Instead it is formed using the adverb \"méi\": e.g. \"schéin\" → \"méi schéin\"\n\nThe superlative involves a synthetic form consisting of the adjective and the suffix \"-st\": e.g. \"schéin\" → \"schéinst \" (compare German \"schönst\", English \"prettiest\"). Attributive modification requires the emphatic definite article and the inflected superlative adjective:\n\nPredicative modification uses either the same adjectival structure or the adverbial structure \"am\"+ -\"sten\": e.g. \"schéin\" → \"am schéinsten\":\n\nSome common adjectives have exceptional comparative and superlative forms:\n\nSeveral other adjectives also have comparative forms. However, these are not commonly used as normal comparatives, but in special senses:\n\nLuxembourgish exhibits \"verb second\" word order in clauses. More specifically, Luxembourgish is a V2-SOV language, like German and Dutch. In other words, we find the following finite clausal structures:\n\nNon-finite verbs (infinitives and participles) generally appear in final position:\n\nThese rules interact so that in subordinate clauses, the finite verb and any non-finite verbs must all cluster at the end. Luxembourgish allows different word orders in these cases:\nThis is also the case when two non-finite verb forms occur together:\n\nLuxembourgish (like Dutch and German) allows prepositional phrases to appear after the verb cluster in subordinate clauses:\n\nLuxembourgish has borrowed many French words. For example, the name for a bus driver is \"Buschauffeur\" (also Dutch and Swiss German), which would be \"Busfahrer\" in German and \"chauffeur de bus\" in French.\n\nSome words are different from Standard German but have equivalents in German dialects. An example is \"Gromperen\" (potatoes – German: \"Kartoffeln\"). Other words are exclusive to Luxembourgish.\n\n\"Note: Words spoken in sound clip do not reflect all words on this list.\"\nNeologisms in Luxembourgish include both entirely new words, and the attachment of new meanings to old words in everyday speech. The most recent neologisms come from the English language in the fields of telecommunications, computer science, and the Internet.\n\nRecent neologisms in Luxembourgish include:\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, Luxembourgish linguist Jérôme Lulling compiled a lexical database of 125,000 word forms as the basis for the very first Luxembourgish spellchecker (Projet C.ORT.IN.A).\n\nThe LaF (\"Lëtzebuergesch als Friemsprooch\" – Luxembourgish as a Foreign Language) is a set of four language proficiency certifications for Luxembourgish and follows the ALTE framework of language examination standards. The tests are administered by the Institut National des Langues Luxembourg.\n\nThe \"Centre for Luxembourg Studies\" at the University of Sheffield was founded in 1995 on the initiative of Professor Gerald Newton. It is supported by the government of Luxembourg which funds an endowed chair in Luxembourg Studies at the university.\nThe first class of students to study the language outside of the country as undergraduate students began their studies at the 'Centre for Luxembourg Studies' at Sheffield in the academic year 2011–2012.\n\n\nIn English\n\nIn French\n\nIn Luxembourgish\n\nIn German\n\n\n"}

The article suggests that the cities share similarities, especially in being globalised financial and cultural centres, and are the most remarkable cities in the 21st century. The article elicited a strong positive response in Hong Kong but remains little known in the other two cities.\n\nNylonkong, from \"NY\" (New York City), \"Lon\" (London), and Kong (Hong Kong) first appeared in \"Time\" article \"A Tale of Three Cities\" in 2008.\n\nAccording to \"Time\", these cities share similarities in cultural and economic establishments. They are influential in cultural industries, including art auctions, movies, and pop songs. In addition, the cities are top international financial centres located in different time zones. \"Time\" further described the cites as the three most remarkable international cities in the 21st century, and one could better understand the world through understanding Nylonkong. Financial Development Index ranks Hong Kong, USA, and UK as the first to third places of the table, accordingly.\n\nAn extended range of responses was observed in media and academia after the term was coined, such as in the Mingpao Daily. The term was first quoted in academia by Yin Pak Andrew Lau in the Liberal Studies Youth Summit on Basic Law, and Sing Tao Daily suggested that the term is a profound sign of globalization. The influence is substantial and long-lasting, and has imposed a constant check on the achievement of the three financial hubs. In 2016, Lam Hang-chi, an economist, for example, suggested that Nylonkong would fade out if the financial hubs were not constantly competitive. In late 2016, Tai Kung Pao suggested that Hong Kong should not compare itself with New York and London, as the Asian financial center is politically and socially autonomous when compared to the other two, which were only cities; the passage further argues that the autonomous entity of Hong Kong requires more diversified economic development like other Four Asian Tigers economies.\n\nIn popular culture, the term has also influenced the Marvel Cinematic Universe, being the locations of both the three Sanctums in \"Doctor Strange\" and Erik Killmonger's war dogs in \"Black Panther.\n\n"}

It consists in first teaching a simple language (Esperanto), then two years later teaching a second language. Many studies confirmed that learning a complete and easy propaedeutical language helps in later learning a more difficult one with no lost time, indeed with gain of it.\n\nThe effectiveness of this method was empirically noticed in different studies of the last century. Prof. Helmar Frank, of the University of Paderborn's Institute of Pedagogic Cybernetics, scientifically proved the method's efficacy; his study gave the name to this method.\n\nMany adults who learned Esperanto had noticed that they could better understand the grammar of their own mother tongue and foreign languages — thanks to having come to know this simple, planned language with its transparent grammar — and started to think that such a language could have propaedeutical value in language teaching.\n\nThis consideration led to many independent experiments being done in Hungary, Great Britain and other countries. Some of the most significant were:\n\nUnder the supervision of Helmar Frank, a professor at the Institute of Cybernetics of Paderborn, two groups of pupils (A and B), both with German as mother tongue, were created in a primary school. The aim was to prove the propaedeutical value of Esperanto for learning English (and in general, any other foreign language).\n\nGroup A started to learn English from the third year of study, while group B in the same year started to learn Esperanto (160 hours); group B also started to learn English after two years (i.e., in the fifth year of study). Although group B studied English two years less than group A did, by the seventh year the two groups reached the same level in English, while in the eighth year of school the English level of group B was more advanced than that of group A.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Paderborn experiment:\nThe study demonstrated not only that group B gained linguistic skills with English, but also that group members could use two languages instead of only one. Because all the pupils had a Germanic language (German) as their mother tongue, the help they got from Esperanto was not a result of its greater similarity to English than to German. In addition to cultural gains, the saving of time and resources resulted in an educational saving as well.\n\nThere could be many reasons why this method works, notice also that in the following only Esperanto is mentioned, because this method uses it, but it is likely that another very easy planned language with similar features could be employed instead.\n\n\nOther hypotheses are discussed by Claude Piron in some of his articles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1900364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900364", "title": "Rotuman language", "text": "Rotuman language\n\nRotuman, also referred to as \"Rotunan\", \"Rutuman\" or \"Fäeag Rotuma\", is an Austronesian language spoken by the indigenous people of the South Pacific island group of Rotuma, an island with a Polynesian-influenced culture that was incorporated as a dependency into the Colony of Fiji in 1881. Classification of Rotuman is difficult due to the large number of loan words from Samoan and Tongan, as a result of much cultural exchange over the history of the Pacific. Linguist Andrew Pawley groups the language with the West Fijian languages in a West Fijian – Rotuman branch of the Central Pacific sub-group of Oceanic languages.\n\nThe Rotuman language has sparked much interest with linguists because the language uses metathesis to invert the ultimate vowel in a word with the immediately preceding consonant, resulting in a vowel system characterized by umlaut, vowel shortening or extending and diphthongisation.\n\nUnlike its Pacific neighbours, Rotuman is typically considered an AVO (agent–verb–object) language.\n\nRotuman has no phonemic vowel length and is underlyingly a language of open syllables. Thus, only consonant + vowel syllables exist in the underlying syllable structure, although phonological processes provide for more variation. A minimal word constraint that disallows words of less than two moras also alters this underlying representation. Except for words from non-lexical categories, a word like ('tomorrow') is realized as . That constraint applies before word compounding (including reduplication as well): ('coral reef') + ('deep sea') → ('deep sea pool'). Vowels are also lengthened when both final and stressed.\n\nNon-high vowels are raised when they are followed by a syllable with a high vowel.\n\nGenerally speaking, when is followed by within a metrical foot, it is fronted to .\n\nAn important aspect of Rotuman morphonology is what could be called the \"incomplete\" and \"complete\" phases although they have also been referred to as \"long\" and \"short\" forms, \"primary\" and \"secondary\" forms, \"absolute\" and \"construct\" cases, and \"proper and original\" and \"altered or construct\" forms. The complete phase applies to semantically-definite or specific terms. Otherwise, in normal conversation (excluding song, poetry and chant), the incomplete phase applies to all but the last morpheme of a word and all but the last word of a phrase. That can lead to syllable-final consonants in the language, which has an underlying all-open syllable system.\n\nThe above table (C indicates any consonant) shows that metathesis and deletion are important parts of incomplete phase formation. The final vowel and the immediately-preceding consonant metathesize from VCV#, to VVC# where V is any underlying penultimate vowel, V is any underlying ultimate vowel, C is any consonant, and # is the word, phrase, or morpheme boundary.\nAfter metathesis, \"V is deleted if V is not further back than V and if V is not lower than V\" or if the two vowels are identical. Further processes of elision result in coalescence or spreading of features: back vowels are fronted before front vowels of equal or greater height ( and/or affect and just affects ) before the latter are deleted.\n\nIn addition, the → rule takes effect again, now outside of the moraic foot, and can occur with a following and both . Also, becomes \"after\" a syllable with a high vowel ( or ). When V is higher than V, it is devocalized to the corresponding semivowel; for front vowels and for back vowels.\n\nWord stress is associated with left-dominant bimoraic feet. The penultimate mora of nonderived words carries the stress. LOther than the nominalizing suffix || and the causative suffix ||, stress is assigned before additional morphemes are affixed and before incomplete phase morphonology.\n\nUpon missionary contact, various orthographies abounded on the island of Rotuma. The French Catholic missionaries devised an orthography based on their own alphabet, and the primarily-English Wesleyan Methodist preachers developed their own orthography to write in Rotuman. The prevalent one used today is one from the Australian Methodist Reverend C. M. Churchward, whose knowledge of linguistics devised the Tongan orthography as well. Here is the alphabet, as it appears in Churchward's seminal work, \"Rotuman Grammar and Dictionary\":\n\nFor the variations to the vowels \"a\", \"o\" and \"i\", Churchward's dictionary treats these letters as if no variation between the species occurred within the base letter: the word \"päega\", meaning \"seat\", appears before \"pạri\" meaning \"banana\", which, in turn, appears before \"pau\", meaning very much.\n\nIn addition, there are instances of all original vowels above appearing with a macron, indicating\nthat they are longer, although vowel length is arguably a phonological process.\n\nBecause Churchward's alphabet was created before a sufficient analysis of Rotuman phonology, it is not purely phonemic. George Milner proposed a more phonemic spelling without diacritics, which incorporates the understanding of vowel allophony as having to do with metathesis (see above)\n\nThis is the Rotuman language version of the Lord's prayer, as found in the translation of the Bible published in 1975 (Matthew 6:9–13) . It is written using the diacritics of Churchward's orthography:\n\n\n"}

Accordingly, they might sometimes dedicate their lives to acting in ways they believe will contribute to its rapid yet safe realization.\n\n\"Time\" magazine describes the worldview of Singularitarians by saying that \"even though it sounds like science fiction, it isn't, no more than a weather forecast is science fiction. It's not a fringe idea; it's a serious hypothesis about the future of life on Earth. There's an intellectual gag reflex that kicks in anytime you try to swallow an idea that involves super-intelligent immortal cyborgs, but... while the Singularity appears to be, on the face of it, preposterous, it's an idea that rewards sober, careful evaluation.\"\n\nThe term \"Singularitarian\" was originally defined by Extropian thinker Mark Plus (Mark Potts) in 1991 to mean \"one who believes the concept of a Singularity\". This term has since been redefined to mean \"Singularity activist\" or \"friend of the Singularity\"; that is, one who acts so as to bring about the singularity. \n\nSingularitarianism can also be thought of as an orientation or an outlook that prefers the enhancement of human intelligence as a specific transhumanist goal instead of focusing on specific technologies such as A.I. There are also definitions that identify a singularitarian as an activist or a friend of the concept of singularity, that is, one who acts so as to bring about a singularity. Some sources described it as a moral philosophy that advocates deliberate action to bring about and steer the development of a superintelligence that will lead to a theoretical future point that emerges during a time of accelerated change.\n\nInventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, author of the 2005 book \"The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology\", defines a Singularitarian as someone \"who understands the Singularity and who has reflected on its implications for his or her own life\" and estimates .\n\nIn 1993, mathematician, computer scientist, and science fiction author Vernor Vinge hypothesized that the moment might come when technology will allow \"creation of entities with greater than human intelligence\" and used the term \"the Singularity\" to describe this moment. He suggested that the singularity may pose an existential risk for humanity, and that it could happen through one of four means:\n\n1. The development of computers that are \"awake\" and superhumanly intelligent. \n\n2. Large computer networks (and their associated users) may \"wake up\" as a superhumanly intelligent entity.\n\n3. Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent.\n\n4. Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural human intellect. \n\nSingularitarianism coalesced into a coherent ideology in 2000 when artificial intelligence (AI) researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote \"The Singularitarian Principles\", in which he stated that a Singularitarian believes that the singularity is a secular, non-mystical event which is possible and beneficial to the world and is worked towards by its adherents. Yudkowsky's conceptualization of singularity offered a broad definition developed to be inclusive of various interpretations. There are theorists such as Michael Anissimov who argued for a strict definition, one that refers only to the advocacy of the development of posthuman (greater than human) intelligence. \n\nIn June 2000 Yudkowsky, with the support of Internet entrepreneurs Brian Atkins and Sabine Atkins, founded the Machine Intelligence Research Institute to work towards the creation of self-improving Friendly AI. MIRI's writings argue for the idea that an AI with the ability to improve upon its own design (Seed AI) would rapidly lead to superintelligence. These Singularitarians believe that reaching the singularity swiftly and safely is the best possible way to minimize net existential risk.\n\nMany people believe a technological singularity is possible without adopting Singularitarianism as a moral philosophy. Although the exact numbers are hard to quantify, Singularitarianism is a small movement, which includes transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, who predicts that the , greatly contributed to popularizing Singularitarianism with his 2005 book \"The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology\".\n\nWith the support of NASA, Google and a broad range of technology forecasters and technocapitalists, the Singularity University opened in June 2009 at the NASA Research Park in Silicon Valley with the goal of preparing the next generation of leaders to address the challenges of accelerating change.\n\nIn July 2009, many prominent Singularitarians participated in a conference organized by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard (i.e., cybernetic revolt). They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They warned that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence\". They asserted that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls. Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. The President of the AAAI has commissioned a study to look at this issue.\n\nThere are several objections to Kurzweil's singularitarianism and these even include criticisms from optimists within the A.I. field. For instance, Pulitzer Prize winning author Douglas Hofstadter argued that Kurweil's predicted achievement of human-level A.I. by 2045 is not viable. Even Gordon Moore, who is credited for introducing the Moore's Law that predicated the notion of singularity, maintained that it will never occur. According to some observers, these criticisms do not diminish enthusiasm for singularity because it has assumed a quasi-religious response to the fear of death, allowing its adherents to enjoy the benefits of religion without its ontological burdens. Science journalist John Horgan provided more insights into this notion as he likened singularitarianism to a religion:\nKurzweil rejects this categorization, stating that his predictions about the singularity are driven by the data that increases in computational technology have been exponential in the past. He also stressed that critics who challenge his view mistakenly take an intuitive linear view of technological advancement.\n\n\n"}

Neale is currently Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Linguistics and holder of the John H. Kornblith Family Chair in the Philosophy of Science and Values at the Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY).\nNeale completed his B. Phil in Linguistics at University College London working with linguist Deirdre Wilson. He completed his PhD in Philosophy at Stanford University with philosopher John Perry as his dissertation advisor. \n\nPrior to joining the CUNY faculty, Neale held positions at Princeton University, University of California, Berkeley, and Rutgers University. \n\nHe is one of the world's leading authorities on Bertrand Russell's Theory of Descriptions, on the philosophies of Paul Grice and Donald Davidson, and on the intricacies of formal arguments in logic known as slingshots. His best known writings are the books \"Descriptions\" (1990) and \"Facing Facts\" (2001), and the articles \"Meaning, Grammar, and Indeterminacy\" (1987), \"Paul Grice and the Philosophy of Language\" (1992), \"Term limits\" (1993), \"No Plagiarism Here!\" (2001).\n\nPhilosophers of language who have written their PhD dissertations under Neale's supervision include Pierre Baumann (University of Puerto Rico), Herman Cappelen (University of Oslo), Josh Dever (University of Texas, Austin), Eli Dresner (Tel Aviv University), Daniel Harris (CUNY), Angel Pinillos (Arizona State University), and Elmar Unnsteinsson (University College Dublin).\n\nNeale's writings are primarily in the philosophy of language, construed broadly enough to intersect with generative linguistics, the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, philosophical logic, and formal logic. A realist (rather than a pragmatist) position on truth runs through his work, although he appears to be agnostic about the explanatory value of appeals to individual facts in philosophical talk about truth. \n\nTraditional accounts of interpretation are marred, Neale claims, by (1) a failure to engage correctly with the epistemic asymmetry of the situations in which producers and consumers of language find themselves; (2) a consequent failure to distinguish adequately the metaphysical question of what determines what a speaker (or writer) means on a given occasion from the epistemological question of how that particular meaning is identified; (3) a failure to appreciate the severity of constraints on the formation of linguistic intentions; (4) failures to appreciate pervasive forms of underdeterminaton (such as those examined by pragmatists and relevance theorists); (5) failures to recognise that genuine indeterminacy of the sort associated with what speakers (and writers) \"imply\" incomplete descriptions, and on a slingshot argument originally used by Kurt Gödel. \n\nNeale is an \"intentionalist\" and a \"pragmatist\" about the interpretation of speech and writing, and to this extent his work is rooted firmly in the Gricean tradition. While probably a Quinean in his attitude towards indeterminacy in the realm of meaning, Neale is a Chomskyan and a Fodorian in his stance on what they \"say\" (for example, when they use incomplete definite descriptions); (6) inappropriate reliance on formal notions of context deriving from indexical logics, (7) unwarranted faith in transcendent notions of \"what is said\", \"what is implied\" and \"what is referred to\"; and metaphysics, theory of legal interpretation, and literary theory. Philosophical problems about interpretation, context, information content, structure, and representation form the nexus of Neale's work. He has vigorously defended Russell's Theory of Descriptions, descriptive theories of anaphora, Paul Grice's intention-based theory of meaning, and a general approach to meaning and interpretation he calls \"linguistic pragmatism\". His most influential work to date has been on the underdetermination and indeterminacy associated with uses of so-called attitude towards syntax and mental representation. Aspects of syntactic theory (8) a quite general overestimation of the role traditional compositional semantics can play in explanations of how humans use language to represent the world and communicate.\n\nNeale also wrote an influential defense of Saul Kripke in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" against charges that Kripke's new theory of reference had plagiarized work by Ruth Barcan Marcus.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2097760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097760", "title": "Stylometry", "text": "Stylometry\n\nStylometry is the application of the study of linguistic style, usually to written language, but it has successfully been applied to music and to fine-art paintings as well.\n\nStylometry is often used to attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed documents. It has legal as well as academic and literary applications, ranging from the question of the authorship of Shakespeare's works to forensic linguistics.\n\nStylometry grew out of earlier techniques of analyzing texts for evidence of authenticity, author identity, and other questions.\n\nThe modern practice of the discipline received major impetus from the study of authorship problems in English Renaissance drama. Researchers and readers observed that some playwrights of the era had distinctive patterns of language preferences, and attempted to use those patterns to identify authors in uncertain or collaborative works. Early efforts were not always successful: in 1901, one researcher attempted to use John Fletcher's preference for \"'em\", the contractional form of \"them\", as a marker to distinguish between Fletcher and Philip Massinger in their collaborations—but he mistakenly employed an edition of Massinger's works in which the editor had expanded all instances of \"'em\" to \"them\".\n\nThe basics of stylometry were set out by Polish philosopher Wincenty Lutosławski in \"Principes de stylométrie\" (1890). Lutosławski used this method to build a chronology of Plato's Dialogues.\n\nThe development of computers and their capacities for analyzing large quantities of data enhanced this type of effort by orders of magnitude. The great capacity of computers for data analysis, however, did not guarantee quality output. In the early 1960s, Rev. A. Q. Morton produced a computer analysis of the fourteen Epistles of the New Testament attributed to St. Paul, which showed that six different authors had written that body of work. A check of his method, applied to the works of James Joyce, gave the result that \"Ulysses\", Joyce's multi-perspective, multi-style masterpiece, was written by five separate individuals, none of whom apparently had any part in the crafting of Joyce's first novel, \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\"\n\nIn time, however, and with practice, researchers and scholars have refined their approaches and methods, to yield better results. One notable early success was the resolution of disputed authorship in twelve of \"The Federalist Papers\" by Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace. \nWhile questions of initial assumptions and methodology still arise (and, perhaps, always will), few now dispute the basic premise that linguistic analysis of written texts can produce valuable information and insight. (Indeed, this was apparent even before the advent of computers: the successful application of a textual/linguistic approach to the Fletcher canon by Cyrus Hoy and others yielded clear results in the late 1950s and early '60s.)\n\nApplications of stylometry include literary studies, historical studies, social studies, gender studies, and many forensic cases and studies. It can also be applied to computer code.\n\nModern stylometry draws heavily on the aid of computers for statistical analysis, artificial intelligence and access to the growing corpus of texts available via the Internet. Software systems such as Signature (freeware produced by Dr Peter Millican of Oxford University), JGAAP (the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program—freeware produced by Dr Patrick Juola of Duquesne University), stylo (an open-source R package for a variety of stylometric analyses, including authorship attribution, developed by Maciej Eder, Jan Rybicki and Mike Kestemont) and Stylene for Dutch (online freeware by Prof Walter Daelemans of University of Antwerp and Dr Véronique Hoste of University of Ghent) make its use increasingly practicable, even for the non-expert.\n\nStylometry has been used in a number of high-profile cases. Matthew Jockers used stylometric techniques to analyse the Book of Mormon, concluding that Sidney Rigdon, and not Joseph Smith, was its author.\nMore recently, a critique by Schaalje et al. of the above paper by Jockers et al. was published in Literary and Linguistic Computing (now Digital Scholarship in the Humanities), showing the Jockers et al. application (using a closed set of candidate authors, rather than an open one) of nearest shrunken centroid (NSC) classification to be misguided. The closed-set method leads to nonsensical results when applied to other authorship attribution problems, as the Schaalje et al. paper shows. Schaalje and colleagues produced results from an open-set NSC method showing that Sidney Rigdon was a very unlikely author—a result that comports with documented history that Rigdon and Smith did not even know each other in 1829 or early 1830, when the Book of Mormon was dictated and published, making it manifestly impossible for Rigdon to have been the author. Schaalje and colleagues also demonstrated that both Joseph Smith and the men who acted as scribes were unlikely authors, while also revealing multiple distinct voices aligning with the main purported authors of the text. \n\nSimon Fuller and James O'Sullivan published a study claiming that bestselling author James Patterson does not do any writing in his co-authored novels. According to O'Sullivan, his collaboration with former U.S. president Bill Clinton, \"The President is Missing\", is an exception to this rule.\n\nStylometric methods are discussed in several academic fields, mostly as a tangential field of application as with machine learning, natural language processing, and lexicography.\nThe International Association of Forensic Linguists (IAFL) organises the Biennial Conference of the International Association of Forensic Linguists (13th edition in 2016 in Porto) and publishes \"The International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law\" with forensic stylistics as one of its central topics.\n\nThe Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) has hosted several events on subjective and stylistic analysis of text.\n\nPAN workshops (originally, plagiarism analysis, authorship identification, and near-duplicate detection, later more generally workshop on uncovering plagiarism, authorship, and social software misuse) organised since 2007 mainly in conjunction with information access conferences such as ACM SIGIR, FIRE, and CLEF. PAN formulates shared challenge tasks for plagiarism detection, authorship identification, author gender identification, author profiling, vandalism detection, and other related text analysis tasks, many of which hinge on stylometry.\n\n\nSince stylometry has both descriptive use cases, used to characterise the content of a collection, and identificatory use cases, e.g. identifying authors or categories of texts, the methods used to analyse the data and features above range from those built to classify items into sets or to distribute items in a space of feature variation. Most methods are statistical in nature, such as cluster analysis and discriminant analysis, are typically based on philological data and features, and are fruitful application domains for modern machine learning approaches. \n\nWhereas in the past, stylometry emphasized the rarest or most striking elements of a text, contemporary techniques can isolate identifying patterns even in common parts of speech. Most systems are based on lexical statistics, i.e. using the frequencies of words and terms in the text to characterise the text (or its author). In this context, unlike in information retrieval, the observed occurrence patterns of the most common words are more interesting than the topical terms which are less frequent.\n\nThe primary stylometric method is the writer invariant: a property held in common by all texts, or at least all texts long enough to admit of analysis yielding statistically significant results, written by a given author. An example of a writer invariant is frequency of function words used by the writer.\n\nIn one such method, the text is analyzed to find the 50 most common words. The text is then broken into 5,000 word chunks and each of the chunks is analyzed to find the frequency of those 50 words in that chunk. This generates a unique 50-number identifier for each chunk. These numbers place each chunk of text into a point in a 50-dimensional space. This 50-dimensional space is flattened into a plane using principal components analysis (PCA). This results in a display of points that correspond to an author's style. If two literary works are placed on the same plane, the resulting pattern may show if both works were by the same author or different authors.\n\nNeural networks, a special case of statistical machine learning methods, have been used to analyze authorship of texts. Text of undisputed authorship are used to train the neural network through processes such as backpropagation, where training error is calculated and used to update the process to increase accuracy. Through a process akin to non-linear regression, the network gains the ability to generalize its recognition ability to new texts to which it has not yet been exposed, classifying them to a stated degree of confidence. Such techniques were applied to the long-standing claims of collaboration of Shakespeare with his contemporaries Fletcher and Christopher Marlowe, and confirmed the view, based on more conventional scholarship, that such collaboration had indeed taken place. \nA 1999 study showed that a neural network program reached 70% accuracy in determining authorship of poems it had not yet analyzed. This study from Vrije Universiteit examined identification of poems by three Dutch authors using only letter sequences such as \"den\".\n\nA study used deep belief networks (DBN) for authorship verification model applicable for continuous authentication (CA).\n\nOne problem with this method of analysis is that the network can become biased based on its training set, possibly selecting authors the network has more often analyzed.\n\nThe genetic algorithm is another machine learning technique used in stylometry. This involves a method that starts out with a set of rules. An example rule might be, \"If \"but\" appears more than 1.7 times in every thousand words, then the text is author X\". The program is presented with text and uses the rules to determine authorship. The rules are tested against a set of known texts and each rule is given a fitness score. The 50 rules with the lowest scores are thrown out. The remaining 50 rules are given small changes and 50 new rules are introduced. This is repeated until the evolved rules correctly attribute the texts.\n\nOne method for identifying style is called \"rare pairs\", and relies upon individual habits of collocation. The use of certain words may, for a particular author, idiosyncratically entail the use of other, predictable words.\n\nThe diffusion of Internet has shifted the authorship attribution attention towards online texts (web pages, blogs, etc.) electronic messages (e-mails, tweets, posts, etc.), and other types of written information that are far shorter than an average book, much less formal and more diverse in terms of expressive elements such as colors, layout, fonts, graphics, emoticons, etc. Efforts to take into account such aspects at the level of both structure and syntax were reported in. In addition, content-specific and idiosyncratic cues (e.g., topic models and grammar checking tools) were introduced to unveil deliberate stylistic choices.\n\nStandard stylometric features have been employed to categorize the content of a chat over instant messaging, or the behavior of the participants, but attempts of identifying chat participants are still few and early. Furthermore, the similarity between spoken conversations and chat interactions has been neglected while being a key difference between chat data and any other type of written information.\n\n\nSee also the academic journal \"Literary and Linguistic Computing\" (published by the University of Oxford) and the \"Language Resources and Evaluation\" journal.\n\n"}
{"id": "3446949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3446949", "title": "Symbol grounding problem", "text": "Symbol grounding problem\n\nThe symbol grounding problem is related to the problem of how words (symbols) get their meanings, and hence to the problem of what meaning itself really is. The problem of meaning is in turn related to the problem of consciousness, or how it is that mental states are meaningful.\n\nGottlob Frege distinguished a referent (the thing that a word refers to) and the word's meaning. This is most clearly illustrated using the proper names of concrete individuals, but it is also true of names of kinds of things and of abstract properties: (1) \"Tony Blair\", (2) \"the prime minister of the UK during the year 2004\", and (3) \"Cherie Blair's husband\" all have the same referent, but not the same meaning.\n\nSome have suggested that the meaning of a (referring) word is the rule or features that one must use in order to successfully pick out its referent. In that respect, (2) and (3) come closer to wearing their meanings on their sleeves, because they are explicitly stating a rule for picking out their referents: \"Find whoever was prime minister of the UK during the year 2004\", or \"find whoever is Cherie's current husband\". But that does not settle the matter, because there's still the problem of the meaning of the components of that rule (\"UK,\" \"during\", \"current\", \"PM\", \"Cherie\", \"husband\"), and how to pick \"them\" out.\n\nThe phrase \"Tony Blair\" (or better still, just \"Tony\") does not have this recursive component problem, because it points straight to its referent, but how? If the meaning is the rule for picking out the referent, what is that rule, when we come down to non-decomposable components like proper names of individuals (or names of \"kinds\", as in \"an unmarried man\" is a \"bachelor\")?\n\nHumans are able to pick out the intended referents of words, such as \"Tony Blair\" or \"bachelor,\" but this process need not be explicit. It is probably an unreasonable expectation to know the explicit rule for picking out the intended referents.\n\nSo if we take a word's meaning to be the means of picking out its referent, then meanings are in our brains. That is meaning in the \"narrow\" sense. If we use \"meaning\" in a \"wider\" sense, then we may want to say that meanings include both the referents themselves and the means of picking them out. So if a word (say, \"Tony-Blair\") is located inside an entity (e.g., oneself) that can use the word and pick out its referent, then the word's wide meaning consists of both the means that that entity uses to pick out its referent, and the referent itself: a wide causal nexus between (1) a head, (2) a word inside it, (3) an object outside it, and (4) whatever \"processing\" is required in order to successfully connect the inner word to the outer object.\n\nBut what if the \"entity\" in which a word is located is not a head but a piece of paper (or a computer screen)? What is its meaning then? Surely all the (referring) words on this screen, for example, have meanings, just as they have referents.\n\nIn the 19th century, the semiotician Charles Saunders Peirce suggested what some think is a similar model: according to his triadic sign model, meaning requires (1) an interpreter, (2) a sign or representamen, (3) an object, and is (4) the virtual product of an endless regress and progress called Semiosis. Some have interpreted Peirce as addressing the problem of grounding, feelings, and intentionality for the understanding of semiotic processes. In recent years, Peirce's theory of signs has been rediscovered by an increasing number of artificial intelligence researchers in the context of symbol grounding problem.\n\nThere would be no connection at all between written symbols and any intended referents if there were no minds mediating those intentions, via their own internal means of picking out those intended referents.\n\nSo the meaning of a word on a page is \"ungrounded.\" Nor would looking it up in a dictionary help: If one tried to look up the meaning of a word one did not understand in a dictionary of a language one did not already understand, one would just cycle endlessly from one meaningless definition to another. One's search for meaning would be ungrounded.\n\nIn contrast, the meaning of the words in one's head—those words one \"does\" understand—are \"grounded\". That mental grounding of the meanings of words mediates between the words on any external page one reads (and understands) and the external objects to which those words refer.\n\nAnother symbol system is natural language (Fodor 1975). On paper or in a computer, language, too, is just a formal symbol system, manipulable by rules based on the arbitrary shapes of words. But in the brain, meaningless strings of squiggles become meaningful thoughts. Harnad has suggested two properties that might be required to make this difference:\n\n\nOne property that static paper or, usually, even a dynamic computer lack that the brain possesses is the capacity to pick out symbols' referents. This is what we were discussing earlier, and it is what the hitherto undefined term \"grounding\" refers to. A symbol system alone, whether static or dynamic, cannot have this capacity (any more than a book can), because picking out referents is not just a computational (implementation-independent) property; it is a dynamical (implementation-dependent) property.\n\nTo be grounded, the symbol system would have to be augmented with nonsymbolic, sensorimotor capacities—the capacity to interact autonomously with that world of objects, events, actions, properties and states that its symbols are systematically interpretable (by us) as referring to. It would have to be able to pick out the referents of its symbols, and its sensorimotor interactions with the world would have to fit coherently with the symbols' interpretations.\n\nThe symbols, in other words, need to be connected directly to (i.e., grounded in) their referents; the connection must not be dependent only on the connections made by the brains of external interpreters like us. Just the symbol system alone, without this capacity for direct grounding, is not a viable candidate for being whatever it is that is really going on in our brains when we think meaningful thoughts (Cangelosi & Harnad 2001).\n\nMeaning as the ability to recognize instances (of objects) or perform actions is specifically treated in the paradigm called \"Procedural Semantics\", described in a number of papers including \"Procedural Semantics\" by Philip N. Johnson-Laird and expanded by William A. Woods in \"Meaning and Links\". A brief summary in Woods' paper reads: \"The idea of procedural semantics is that the semantics of natural language sentences can be characterized in a formalism whose meanings are defined by abstract procedures that a computer (or a person) can either execute or reason about. In this theory the meaning of a noun is a procedure for recognizing or generating instances, the meaning of a proposition is a procedure for determining if it is true or false, and the meaning of an action is the ability to do the action or to tell if it has been done.\"\n\nThe necessity of groundedness, in other words, takes us from the level of the pen-pal Turing test, which is purely symbolic (computational), to the robotic Turing test, which is hybrid symbolic/sensorimotor (Harnad 2000, 2007). Meaning is grounded in the robotic capacity to detect, categorize, identify, and act upon the things that words and sentences refer to (see entries for Affordance and for Categorical perception). On the other hand, if the symbols (words and sentences) refer to the very bits of '0' and '1', directly connected to their electronic implementations, which a (any?) computer system can readily manipulate (thus detect, categorize, identify and act upon), then even non-robotic computer systems could be said to be \"sensorimotor\" and hence able to \"ground\" symbols in this narrow domain. \n\nTo categorize is to do the right thing with the right \"kind\" of thing. The categorizer must be able to detect the sensorimotor features of the members of the category that reliably distinguish them from the nonmembers. These feature-detectors must either be inborn or learned. The learning can be based on trial and error induction, guided by feedback from the consequences of correct and incorrect categorization; or, in our own linguistic species, the learning can also be based on verbal descriptions or definitions. The description or definition of a new category, however, can only convey the category and ground its name if the words in the definition are themselves already grounded category names (Blondin-Massé et al. 2008). So ultimately grounding has to be sensorimotor, to avoid infinite regress (Harnad 2005).\n\nBut if groundedness is a necessary condition for meaning, is it a sufficient one? Not necessarily, for it is possible that even a robot that could pass the Turing test, \"living\" amongst the rest of us indistinguishably for a lifetime, would fail to have in its head what Searle has in his: It could be a zombie, with no one home, feeling feelings, meaning meanings (Harnad 1995). However, it is possible that different interpreters (including different intelligent species of animals) would have different mechanisms for producing meaning in their systems, thus one cannot require that a system different from a human \"experiences\" meaning in the same way that a human does, and vice-versa. \n\nHarnad thus points at consciousness as a second property. The problem of discovering the causal mechanism for successfully picking out the referent of a category name can in principle be solved by cognitive science. But the problem of explaining how consciousness could play an \"independent\" role in doing so is probably insoluble, except on pain of telekinetic dualism. Perhaps symbol grounding (i.e., robotic TT capacity) is enough to ensure that conscious meaning is present, but then again, perhaps not. In either case, there is no way we can hope to be any the wiser—and that is Turing's methodological point (Harnad 2001b, 2003, 2006).\n\nTo answer this question we have to formulate the symbol grounding problem itself (Harnad 1990):\n\nThere is a school of thought according to which the computer is more like the brain—or rather, the brain is more like the computer: According to this view (called \"computationalism\", a variety of functionalism), the future theory explaining how the brain picks out its referents (the theory that cognitive neuroscience may eventually arrive at) will be a purely computational one (Pylyshyn 1984). A computational theory is a theory at the software level. It is essentially a computer algorithm: a set of rules for manipulating symbols. And the algorithm is \"implementation-independent.\" That means that whatever it is that an algorithm is doing, it will do the same thing no matter what hardware it is executed on. The physical details of the dynamical system implementing the computation are irrelevant to the computation itself, which is purely formal; any hardware that can run the computation will do, and all physical implementations of that particular computer algorithm are equivalent, computationally.\n\nA computer can execute any computation. Hence once computationalism finds a proper computer algorithm, one that our brain could be running when there is meaning transpiring in our heads, meaning will be transpiring in that computer too, when it implements that algorithm.\n\nHow would we know that we have a proper computer algorithm? It would have to be able to pass the Turing test. That means it would have to be capable of corresponding with any human being as a pen-pal, for a lifetime, without ever being in any way distinguishable from a real human pen-pal.\n\nJohn Searle formulated the \"Chinese room argument\" in order to disprove computationalism. The Chinese room argument is based on a thought experiment: in it, Searle stated that if the Turing test were conducted in Chinese, then he himself, Searle (who does not understand Chinese), could execute a program that implements the same algorithm that the computer was using without knowing what any of the words he was manipulating meant. \n\nAt first glance, it would seem that if there's no meaning going on inside Searle's head when he is implementing that program, then there's no meaning going on inside the computer when it is the one implementing the algorithm either, computation being implementation-independent. But on a closer look, for a person to execute the same program that a computer would, at very least it would have to have access to a similar bank of memory that the computer has (most likely externally stored). This means that the new computational system that executes the same algorithm is no longer just Searle's original head, but that plus the memory bank (and possibly other devices). \nIn particular, this additional memory could store a digital representation of the intended referent of different words (like images, sounds, even video sequences), that the algorithm would use as a model of, and to derive features assotiated with, the intended referent. The \"meaning\" then is not to be searched in just Searle's original brain, but in the overall system needed to process the algorithm. (Just like when Searle is reading English words, the meaning is not to be located in isolated logical processing areas of the brain, but probably in the overall brain, likely including specific long-term memory areas). \nThus, Searle's not perceiving any meaning in his head alone when simulating the work of a computer, does not imply lack of meaning in the overall system, and thus in the actual computer system passing an advanced Turing test.\n\nHow does Searle know that there is no meaning going on in his head when he is executing such a Turing-test-passing program? Exactly the same way he knows whether there is or is not meaning going on inside his head under any other conditions: He \"understands\" the words of English, whereas the Chinese symbols that he is manipulating according to the algorithm's rules mean nothing whatsoever to him (and there is no one else in his head for them to mean anything to). However, the complete system that is manipulating those Chinese symbols - which is not just Searle's brain, as explained in the previous section - may have the ability to extract meaning from those symbols, in the sense of being able to use internal (memory) models of the intended referents, pick out the intended referents of those symbols, and generally identifying and using their features appropriately.\n\nNote that in pointing out that the Chinese words would be meaningless to him under those conditions, Searle has appealed to consciousness. Otherwise one could argue that there \"would\" be meaning going on in Searle's head under those conditions, but that Searle himself would simply not be conscious of it. That is called the \"Systems Reply\" to Searle's Chinese Room Argument, and Searle rejects the Systems Reply as being merely a reiteration, in the face of negative evidence, of the very thesis (computationalism) that is on trial in his thought-experiment: \"Are words in a running computation like the ungrounded words on a page, meaningless without the mediation of brains, or are they like the grounded words in brains?\"\n\nIn this either/or question, the (still undefined) word \"ungrounded\" has implicitly relied on the difference between inert words on a page and consciously meaningful words in our heads. And Searle is asserting that under these conditions (the Chinese Turing test), the words in his head would not be consciously meaningful, hence they would still be as ungrounded as the inert words on a page.\n\nSo if Searle is right, that (1) both the words on a page and those in any running computer program (including a Turing-test-passing computer program) are meaningless in and of themselves, and hence that (2) whatever it is that the brain is doing to generate meaning can't be just implementation-independent computation, then what \"is\" the brain doing to generate meaning (Harnad 2001a)?\n\n\"Intentionality\" has been called the \"mark of the mental\" because of some observations by the philosopher Brentano to the effect that mental states always have an inherent, intended (mental) object or content toward which they are \"directed\": One sees something, wants something, believes something, desires something, understands something, means something etc., and that object is always something that one has \"in mind\". Having a mental object is part of having anything in mind. Hence it is the mark of the mental. There are no \"free-floating\" mental states that do not also have a mental object. Even hallucinations and imaginings have an object, and even feeling depressed feels like something. Nor is the object the \"external\" physical object, when there is one. One may see a real chair, but the \"intentional\" object of one's \"intentional state\" is the mental chair one has in mind. (Yet another term for intentionality has been \"aboutness\" or \"representationality\": thoughts are always \"about\" something; they are (mental) \"representations\" \"of\" something; but that something is what it is that the thinker has in mind, not whatever external object may or may not correspond to it.)\n\nIf this all sounds like skating over the surface of a problem rather than a real break-through, then the foregoing description has had its intended effect: No, the problem of intentionality is not the symbol grounding problem; nor is grounding symbols the solution to the problem of intentionality. The symbols inside an autonomous dynamical symbol system that is able to pass the robotic Turing test are grounded, in that, unlike in the case of an ungrounded symbol system, they do not depend on the mediation of the mind of an external interpreter to connect them to the external objects that they are interpretable (by the interpreter) as being \"about\"; the connection is autonomous, direct, and unmediated. But \"grounding is not meaning\". Grounding is an input/output performance function. Grounding connects the sensory inputs from external objects to internal symbols and states occurring within an autonomous sensorimotor system, guiding the system's resulting processing and output.\n\nMeaning, in contrast, is something mental. But to try to put a halt to the name-game of proliferating nonexplanatory synonyms for the mind/body problem without solving it (or, worse, implying that there is more than one mind/body problem), let us cite just one more thing that requires no further explication: \"feeling\". The only thing that distinguishes an internal state that merely has grounding from one that has meaning is that it \"feels like something\" to be in the meaning state, whereas it does not feel like anything to be in the merely grounded functional state. Grounding is a functional matter; feeling is a felt matter. And that is the real source of Brentano's vexed peekaboo relation between \"intentionality\" and its internal \"intentional object\": All mental states, in addition to being the functional states of an autonomous dynamical system, are also feeling states: Feelings are not merely \"functed,\" as all other physical states are; feelings are also felt.\n\nHence feeling (sentience) is the real mark of the mental. But the symbol grounding problem is not the same as the mind/body problem, let alone a solution to it. The mind/body problem is actually the feeling/function problem: Symbol-grounding touches only its functional component. This does not detract from the importance of the symbol grounding problem, but just reflects that it is a keystone piece to the bigger puzzle called the mind.\n\nThe neuroscientist Antonio Damasio investigates this marking function of feelings and emotions in his Somatic marker hypothesis. Damasio adds the notion of biologic homeostasis to this discussion, presenting it as an automated bodily regulation process providing intentionality to a mind via emotions. Homeostasis is the mechanism that keeps all bodily processes in healthy balance. All of our actions and perceptions will be automatically \"evaluated\" by our body hardware according to their contribution to homeostasis. This gives us an implicit orientation on how to survive. Such bodily or somatic evaluations can come to our mind in the form of conscious and non-conscious feelings (\"gut feelings\") and lead our decision-making process. The meaning of a word can be roughly conceptualized as the sum of its associations and their expected contribution to homeostasis, where associations are reconstructions of sensomotor perceptions that appeared in contiguity with the word. Yet, the Somatic marker hypothesis is still hotly debated and critics claim that it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. The recurrent question that the Somatic marker hypothesis does not address remains: how and why does homeostasis (as in any servomechanism such as a thermostat and furnace) become \"felt\" homeostasis?\n\n\n\n"}

It has never been out of print. It comprises expanded and revised versions of two pamphlets that he wrote at the request of HM Treasury, \"Plain Words\" (1948) and \"ABC of Plain Words\" (1951). The aim of the book is to help officials in their use of English as a tool of their trade. To keep the work relevant for readers in subsequent decades it has been revised by Sir Bruce Fraser in 1973, by Sidney Greenbaum and Janet Whitcut in 1986, and by the original author's great-granddaughter Rebecca Gowers in 2014.\n\nAll the editions until that of 2014 were published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO). The most recent is issued by an imprint of Penguin Books.\n\nThe association of wordiness with bureaucracy has a long history. In the 14th century Geoffrey Chaucer, a prominent civil servant as well as a poet, urged the use of straightforward writing. Reviewing \"Plain Words\" in 1948, \"The Manchester Guardian\" quoted the French revolutionary Martial Herman writing in 1794:\n\nThe British civil service of the 19th and early 20th centuries had a reputation for pomposity and long-windedness in its written communications. In \"Little Dorrit\" in the mid-1850s, Charles Dickens caricatured officialdom as the \"Circumlocution Office\", where for even the most urgent matter nothing could be done without \"half a score of boards, half a bushel of minutes, several sacks of official memoranda, and a family-vault full of ungrammatical correspondence.\" By the 1880s the term \"officialese\" was in use, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as, \"The formal and typically verbose language considered characteristic of officials or official documents\".\nSir Ernest Gowers, a senior civil servant, was among those who wished to see officialese replaced by normal English. In 1929 he remarked in a speech about the civil service, \"It is said... that we revel in jargon and obscurity\". During the Second World War, with the role of government greatly expanded, official communications proliferated, and in Gowers's view were full of \"mistiness and grandiloquence\". He called for a new style of official writing, friendly in tone and easy to understand. His views came to the notice of the head of the civil service, Sir Edward Bridges, permanent secretary to the Treasury. After Gowers retired from the civil service at the end of the war, Bridges asked him to write a short pamphlet on good writing, for the benefit of the new generation of officials. Bridges called on his senior colleagues throughout the civil service to cooperate; some had already made efforts in the same cause, including the Inland Revenue, whose advice to staff included \"one golden rule to bear in mind always: that we should try to put ourselves in the position of our correspondent, to imagine his feelings as he writes his letters, and to gauge his reaction as he receives ours.\"\n\nGovernment departments sent Gowers many examples of officialese so extreme as to be amusing; a small committee of senior officials formed to help him and comment on his proposals. The colleague on whom Gowers most relied was Llewelyn Wyn Griffith of the Inland Revenue, whose contribution Gowers acknowledged in the prefaces to \"Plain Words\" and its two successors.\n\nThe result of Gowers's work was \"Plain Words\", a 94-page booklet. It was judged successful by the civil service, and the Treasury considered that it should be made publicly available. Had Gowers written it as part of his duties while still a civil servant it would have automatically been Crown Copyright, but as he had not begun it until after his retirement he owned the rights. The Treasury offered a flat fee of £500, but he successfully held out for a royalty on every copy sold. The government publisher, His Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO), issued the booklet for sale in April 1948. It was priced at two shillings (10 pence in British decimal currency); between April and Christmas 1948 it sold more than 150,000 copies and had to be reprinted seven times.\n\nReviewers responded favourably. \"The Times Literary Supplement\", praised the book and engaged in a little mock-officialese of its own: \"It deserves to be a 'best seller' (or perhaps we should say that in all the circumstances it may reasonably be anticipated that it will be found to evoke a relatively considerable demand on the part of the general public).\" \"The Times\" devoted a leader to the work, and concluded, \"for all its cool urbanity \"Plain Words\" is written with missionary zeal\". \"The Manchester Guardian\" considered that by commissioning \"Plain Words\" from Gowers \"the Treasury has put us all in its debt.\" \"The Economist\" commented, \"The Stationery Office must have enjoyed publishing this book. It is great fun to read\".\n\nOccasionally Gowers's humour misled literal-minded reviewers. \"The Daily Mail\", Harold Nicolson and the grammarian G H Vallins objected to the conspicuously un-plain words of Gowers's opening sentences:\n\nWhen revising the text in preparation for \"The Complete Plain Words\", Gowers abandoned the joke, and rewrote the second sentence as, \"I suspect that this project may be received by many of them without any marked enthusiasm or gratitude.\" A substantive objection by Vallins to \"the cult of 'plain English'\" was his view that verbose phrases lose important nuances when reduced to plain words. He gave as an example \"evacuated to alternative accommodation\", which in his opinion has overtones that Gowers's \"taken to other houses\" lacks.\n\nThe Treasury invited Gowers to build on the success of \"Plain Words\" by producing a second volume of advice on good, clear writing. As with its predecessor, he \"had many helpers to thank\", including Griffith and other civil service colleagues. He also drew on the works of well-known writers on English usage, including H W Fowler, A P Herbert and Eric Partridge. \"The ABC of Plain Words\" had 160 pages, and was priced at three shillings (15p).\n\nGowers explained the purpose of the new book in his preface, \"We must have something that can be kept on the desk and consulted on points of difficulty as they arise. \"Plain Words\" is of little use for that: it has not even an index\". The new work consisted of articles, mostly brief, on points of vocabulary, grammar, construction, punctuation and style, set out in alphabetical order, beginning with \"Abstract words\" and ending with \"Write\". The former was one of the longer entries, explaining the dangers of overuse of abstract words, and recommending concrete terms where possible. Thus, \"Was this the realisation of an anticipated liability?\" would be better as, \"Did you expect to have to do this?\" The entry on \"Write\" was an example of one of the short articles on particular words; it pointed out that \"I wrote to you about it\" needs the \"to\" but \"I wrote you a letter\" does not.\n\nGowers and his successors revised their advice as usage changed over the years. Two consecutive entries in \"The ABC\" illustrate how some comments have become dated and others have not: Gowers warned in 1951 that the word \"backlog\" meaning \"arrears\" would be unintelligible to British readers, and in the next entry he advised that the construction \"on a ... basis\" should be avoided. The latter remains a frequent feature of loose writing and all the editions of the \"Plain Words\" books retain and expand Gowers's advice, whereas within three years of writing \"The ABC\", Gowers noted in \"The Complete Plain Words\" that \"backlog\" was rapidly and usefully establishing itself in British usage.\n\nNeither the Treasury nor HMSO expected the second book to rival the popularity of its predecessor, but it sold nearly 80,000 copies in its first year. Gowers was nevertheless not wholly happy with it. He thought the A–Z layout had two disadvantages. The first was that it gave the wrong impression that all the topics were of equal importance; the second was that the people most in need of advice would not think to look up the relevant entry: \"There is no reason why anyone addicted to abstract nouns, unconscious of any offence, should ever be prompted to read that article; nor can I think of any other title for it that would be more likely to throw it in his way.\"\n\nBy 1954 both books were still selling well. Almost 300,000 copies of \"Plain Words\" and more than 130,000 of \"The ABC\" had been sold. The Treasury, HMSO and Gowers agreed that the obvious and best course would be to combine the two booklets into a single volume. This Gowers did, with help from his colleagues, as before; he made many revisions as a result of \"the many correspondents from all parts of the English-speaking world who have been good enough … to send me suggestions, criticisms and specimens\". An example of his revisions is in the entry on \"bottleneck\", of which in 1951 he had written four brief sentences warning against overuse: in 1954 he felt it necessary to write 270 words, so ubiquitous had the term become. (By the time of the 1973 revision the fad for the word had declined, and Fraser's entry is very much shorter.)\n\n\"The Complete Plain Words\" contained 226 pages, including seven pages of index. It was a hardback, in green cloth binding with dust-jacket, in HMSO's preferred size, used for the two earlier Plain Words books, 8.4in x 5.25in (21.3 cm x 13.3 cm). It was published in September 1954 at what \"The Manchester Guardian\" called the remarkably cheap price of five shillings (25p). \"The Times Literary Supplement\" greeted the publication: \"It may be hoped that in this more durable form the book's good influence will continue to spread: Civil Servants have not been alone in profiting from it in the past, nor should they be in the future.\" The book has remained in print, in its original and revised editions, ever since.\n\nBetween Gowers's prologue and epilogue there is a Digression on Legal English followed by chapters on The Elements, Correctness, Avoiding the Superfluous Word, Choosing the Familiar Word, Choosing the Precise Word, The Handling of Words, and Punctuation.\n\nThe 1954 text was reprinted seven times during Gowers's lifetime, and he made a number of amendments in the various impressions. Changing times in the 1960s meant that a substantial revision was needed if the book was to continue to fulfil its purpose. Gowers, fully occupied for a decade in making the first revision of Fowler's \"Modern English Usage\", was unable to carry out the task; he died in 1966, a few months after the publication of the revised Fowler. Another retired senior civil servant, Bruce Fraser, was asked to revise \"The Complete Plain Words\". The new edition, 250 pages long, was published by HMSO at £1, in hardback with black cloth binding and dust-jacket, in the same format as the first edition.\n\nFraser preserved Gowers's structure, and added three new chapters, the most important of which was titled \"Some recent trends\"; it covered the increasing prevalence of informality, and the influences of America, science, technology, economics, business, and personnel management. The final sections of the chapter were on \"vogue words\" and \"modish writing\". Fraser noted that though Gowers had said approvingly in 1954 that the use of the subjunctive was dying out, it was now, under the influence of American writing, making an unwelcome reappearance in English usage.\n\nReviewing the new edition in \"The Times Literary Supplement\", David Hunt commented of Fraser, \"his wit, perhaps a little drier and more Scottish, is equally acute, diverting and instructive\". In \"The Times\", Dennis Potter said that the book remained \"the happiest thing to come out of the Treasury\". He praised Fraser for replacing Gowers's dated examples of officialese with modern specimens and updating the text to reflect current trends, but concluded:\nThe Fraser edition was reprinted in hardback three times between 1973 and 1983. Penguin published a paperback version in the UK in 1973, and in the US in 1975.\n\nThe third edition was commissioned not by the Treasury but by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, to mark its bicentenary. The revision was made not by an experienced public servant but by an academic and a lexicographer, Sidney Greenbaum, Quain Professor of English Language and Literature at University College, London and Janet Whitcut, formerly senior research editor of the Longman Dictionary. They chose to revise Fraser's 1973 version rather than starting from Gowers's original. Having two authors made it necessary to abandon Gowers's frequent use of the first person; Fraser had retained it, stating \"...the reader may take it that 'I' means either 'Gowers agreed with by Fraser' or 'Fraser, confident that Gowers would agree with him'\". With joint authors for the new edition, this could not be sustained, and the change from first person to impersonal removed some of the book's previous character. An example is in the section on punctuation, where Gowers wrote, \"The author of the style-book of the Oxford University Press... says 'If you take hyphens seriously you will surely go mad'. I have no intention of taking hyphens seriously.\" In the new edition the second sentence read, \"You should not take hyphens seriously\". Rebecca Gowers objects that this approach \"systematically depersonalise[s] the writing\".\n\nThe new edition, in the same format as its two predecessors, is in blue cloth, with dust-jacket, and has 298 pages. A paperback version was issued by Penguin Books in 1987, and an American hardback edition was published in 1988 by Godine Publishing, Boston.\n\nThe last direct link between \"Plain Words\" and the public service was broken in 1996, when HMSO was dismembered under governmental privatisation policy. The 2014 edition of the book was published by Particular Books, an imprint of Penguin Books. It was printed on lower-weight paper and in a smaller format than its predecessors. The reviser was Rebecca Gowers, Ernest's great-granddaughter, a novelist and author of a non-fiction book about a Victorian murder. She begins the new edition with a twenty-page preface that includes a biographical sketch of Ernest Gowers and a history of the revisions after his death.\n\nUnlike the three earlier revisers, Rebecca Gowers generally avoids merging her own comments with the original text. Her practice is to retain Ernest Gowers's remarks and append updated observations in a separate note. An example is the entry on the use of the noun \"issue\". The original words were:\n\nTo which the reviser has added:\nAlthough Fraser, Greenbaum and Whitcut remained broadly faithful to Gowers's original structure and chapter headings, with some minor changes, Rebecca Gowers reverts to the original almost exclusively. The modernisations she introduces, such as the consideration of gender-neutral language, are incorporated into the chapters of the 1954 book.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The idea of unknown unknowns was created in 1955 by two American psychologists, Joseph Luft (1916–2014) and Harrington Ingham (1916–1995) in their development of the Johari window. They used it as a technique to help people better understand their relationship with themselves as well as others.\n\nThe term was also commonly used inside NASA. Rumsfeld himself cited NASA administrator William Graham in his memoir; he wrote that he had first heard \"a variant of the phrase\" from Graham when they served together on the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States during the late 1990s. Kirk Borne, an astrophysicist who was employed as a data scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at the time, noted in an April 2013 TED talk that he had used the phrase \"unknown unknowns\" in a talk to personnel at the Homeland Security Transition Planning Office a few days prior to Rumsfeld's remarks, and speculated that the term may have percolated up to Rumsfeld and other high-ranking officials in the defense department.\n\nThe terms \"known unknowns\" and \"unknown unknowns\" are often used in project management and strategic planning circles.\n\nKnown unknowns refers to \"risks you are aware of, such as cancelled flights...\"\n\nUnknown unknowns are risks that come from situations that are so unexpected that they would not be considered. \"For example, prior to the invention of the personal computer, manufacturers of typewriters probably didn't foresee the risks to their business\". Contemporary usage is largely consistent with the earliest known usages. For example, the term was used in evidence given to the British Columbia Royal Commission of Inquiry into Uranium Mining in 1979:\n\nThe term also appeared in a 1982 \"New Yorker\" article on the aerospace industry, which cites the example of metal fatigue, the cause of crashes in de Havilland Comet airliners in the 1950s.\n\nWhile the remarks initially led to some ridicule towards the Bush administration in general and Rumsfeld in particular, over time the consensus regarding it has shifted over the years and it now enjoys some level of respect. For example, Rumsfeld's defenders have included Canadian columnist Mark Steyn, who called it \"in fact a brilliant distillation of quite a complex matter\", and Australian economist and blogger John Quiggin, who wrote, \"Although the language may be tortured, the basic point is both valid and important.\"\n\nPsychoanalytic philosopher Slavoj Žižek says that beyond these three categories there is a fourth, the unknown known, that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we know: \"If Rumsfeld thinks that the main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were the 'unknown unknowns', that is, the threats from Saddam whose nature we cannot even suspect, then the Abu Ghraib scandal shows that the main dangers lie in the \"unknown knowns\"—the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of our public values.\"\n\nGerman sociologists Daase and Kessler (2007) agree with a basic point of Rumsfeld in stating that the cognitive frame for political practice may be determined by the relationship between \"what we know, what we do not know, what we cannot know\", but Rumsfeld left out \"what we do not like to know\".\n\nThe event has been used in multiple books to discuss risk assessment.\n\nRumsfeld named his autobiography \"\". In an \"Author's Note\" at the start of the book, he expressly acknowledged the source of his memoir's title and mentioned a few examples of his statement's prominence, including this Wikipedia article. \"The Unknown Known\" is the title of Errol Morris's 2013 biographical documentary about Rumsfeld.\n\nThe term \"known unknowns\" has been applied to the identification of chemical substances using analytical chemistry approaches, specifically mass spectrometry. In many cases, an unknown to an investigator that is detected in an experiment is actually known in the chemical literature, a reference database, or an internet resource. These types of compounds are termed \"known unknowns\". The term was originally coined by Little et al. and reported a number of times in the literature since then as a general approach.\n\nA thirteenth-century Persian poet, Ibn Yamin (), said there are four types of men:\n\n"}
{"id": "4128196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4128196", "title": "Urban prairie", "text": "Urban prairie\n\nUrban prairie is a term to describe vacant urban land that has reverted to green space. Previous structures occupying the urban lots have been demolished, leaving patchy areas of green space that are usually untended and unmanaged. Sometimes, however, the prairie spaces are intentionally created to facilitate amenities, such as green belts, community gardens and wildlife reserve habitats.\n\nUrban prairies can result from several factors. The value of aging buildings may fall too low to provide financial incentives for their owners to maintain them. Vacant properties may have resulted from deurbanization or crime, or may have been seized by local government as a response to unpaid property taxes. Since vacant structures can pose health and safety threats (such as fire hazards), or be used as a location for criminal activity, cities often demolish them.\n\nSometimes areas are cleared of buildings as part of a revitalization plan with the intention of redeveloping the land. In flood-prone areas, government agencies may purchase developed lots and then demolish the structures to improve drainage during floods. Some neighborhoods near major industrial or environmental clean-up sites are acquired and leveled to create a buffer zone and minimize the risks associated with pollution or industrial accidents. Such areas may become nothing more than fields of overgrown vegetation, which then provide habitat for wildlife. Sometimes it is possible for residents of the city to fill up the unplanned empty space with urban parks or community gardens.\nUrban prairie is sometimes planned by the government or non-profit groups for community gardens and conservation, to restore or reintroduce a wildlife habitat, help the environment, and educate people about the prairie. Detroit, Michigan is one particular city that has many urban prairies.\n\nIn the case of the city of Christchurch in New Zealand, earthquake damage from the 2011 earthquake caused the underground water table to raise and leak significantly in places, preventing reconstruction of damaged buildings. Many former residential areas in eastern Christchurch suburbs have been purchased by the government and demolished, as the soft soil causes the houses to shift and pose significant danger to the inhabitants. It is unknown if many of the waterlogged areas of Christchurch will ever fully recover.\n\nUrban prairies may be established to lower the burden of mowing and related upkeep by the governmental entity that is overseeing it, letting weeds develop.\n\n"}

Ideally a voice portal could be an access point for any type of information, services, or transactions found on the Internet. Common uses include movie time listings and stock trading.\nIn telecommunications circles, voice portals may be referred to as interactive voice response (IVR) systems, but this term also includes DTMF services.\nWith the emergence of conversational assistants such as Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby, Voice Portals can now be accessed through mobile devices and Far Field voice smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home.\n\nVoice portals have no dependency on the access device; even low end mobile handsets can access the service. Voice portals talk to users in their local language and there is reduced customer learning required for using voice services compared to Internet/SMS based services.\n\nA complex search query that otherwise would take multiple widgets (drop down, check box, text box filling), can easily and effortlessly be formulated by anyone who can speak without needing to be familiar with any visual interfaces. For instance, one can say, \"Find me an eyeliner, not too thick, dark brown, from Estee Lauder MAC, that's below thirty dollars\" or \"What is the closest liquor store from here and what time do they close?\"\n\nVoice is the most natural communication medium, but the information that can be provided is limited compared to visual media.\n\nFor example, most Internet users try a search term, scan results, then adjust the search term to eliminate irrelevant results. They may take two or three quick iterations to get a list that they are confident will contain what they are looking for. The equivalent approach is not practical when results are spoken, as it would take far too long. In this case, a multimodal interaction would be preferable to a voice-only interface.\n\nLive-agent and Internet-based voice portals are converging, and the range of information they can provide is expanding.\n\nLive-agent portals are introducing greater automation through speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, in many cases providing fully automated service, while automated Internet-based portals are adding operator fallback in premium services. The live-agent portals, which used to rely entirely on pre-structured databases holding specific types of information are expanding into more free-form Internet access, while the Internet-based portals are adding pre-structured content to improve automation of the more common types of request.\n\nSpeech technology is starting to introduce Artificial Intelligence concepts that make it practical\nto recognise a much broader range of utterances, learning from experience. This promises to make it practical to greatly improve speaker recognition rates and expand the range of information that can be provided by a voice portal.\n\nA number of web-based companies are dedicated to providing voice-based access to Internet information to consumers.\nQuack.com launched its service in March 2000 and has since obtained the first overall voiceportal patent.\nQuack.com was acquired by AOL in 2000 and relaunched as AOL By Phone later that year. Tellme Networks was acquired by Microsoft in 2007.\nNuance, the dominant provider of speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, is starting to deliver voice portal solutions. Other companies in this space include TelSurf Networks, FonGenie, Apptera and Call Genie.\n\nApart from public voice portal services, a number of technology companies, including Alcatel-Lucent, Avaya, and Cisco, offer commercial enterprise-grade voice portal products to be used by companies to serve their clients.
