It was spoken on the west central coast of North Andaman and on North Reef Island of the Andaman Islands in India.\n\nThe \"Aka-\" at the beginning of the language name is a common Great Andamanese prefix for words related to the tongue, which includes language.\n\nThe original size of the Bo tribe, by 1858, has been estimated at 200 individuals. However, they were discovered by the British only later, in the work leading to the 1901 census. Like other Andamanese peoples, the Bo were decimated during colonial and post-colonial times, by diseases, alcohol, colonial warfare and loss of territory. The census of 1901 recorded only 48 individuals. Census takers were told that an epidemic had come from the neighboring Kari and Kora tribes, and the Bo had resorted to killing all of their own who showed symptoms. Their number was up to 62 in 1911, but then decreased to 16 in 1921 and only 6 in 1931.\n\nIn 1949, any remaining Bo were relocated, with all other surviving Great Andamanese, to a reservation on Bluff island. In 1969 they were moved again to a reservation on Strait Island.\nBy 1980 only three out of the 23 surviving Great Andamanese claimed to belong to the Bo tribe. By 1994 their numbers had grown to 15 (out of 40).\n\nHowever, tribal identities became largely symbolic in the wake of the relocations. By 2006 the cultural and linguistic identity of the tribe had all but disappeared, due to intermarriage and other factors. The last speaker of the Bo language, a woman named Boa Senior, died at age 85 in late January, 2010.\n\nBoa Sr., the last person who remembered any Bo, died on 26 January 2010, at the age of approximately 85.\n\nBoa Sr.'s mother, who died approximately forty years before her death, was the only living speaker of Bo for a long time. Other members of the Great Andamanese speech community had difficulty understanding the songs and narratives which she knew in Bo. She also spoke the Andamanese dialect of Hindi, as well as Great Andamanese, a mix of the ten indigenous languages of Andamans.\n\nBoa Sr. worked with Anvita Abbi, a professor of linguistics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, since 2005. Abbi studied and recorded Boa's language and songs.\n\nBoa Sr. died at a hospital in Port Blair on 26 January 2010. Boa Sr., who was approximately 85 years old, was the oldest living member of the Great Andamanese tribes at the time. Boa Sr.'s death left just 52 surviving Great Andamanese people in the world, none of whom remembers any Bo. Their population is greatly reduced from the estimated 5,000 Great Andamanese living in the Andaman Islands at the time of the arrival of the British in 1858.\n\nStephen Corry, director of the British-based NGO Survival International, issued a statement saying, \"With the death of Boa Sr. and the extinction of the Bo language, a unique part of human society is now just a memory. Boa's loss is a bleak reminder that we must not allow this to happen to the other tribes of the Andaman Islands.\" Linguist Narayan Choudhary also explained what the loss of Boa Sr. meant in both academic and personal terms, \"Her loss is not just the loss of the Great Andamanese community, it is a loss of several disciplines of studies put together, including anthropology, linguistics, history, psychology, and biology. To me, Boa Sr. epitomised a totality of humanity in all its hues and with a richness that is not to be found anywhere else.\"\n\nThe Great Andamanese languages are agglutinative languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system. They have a distinctive noun class system based largely on body parts, in which every noun and adjective may take a prefix according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the tongue. An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of \"yop\", \"pliable, soft\", in Aka-Bea: \nSimilarly, \"beri-nga\" \"good\" yields:\n\nThe prefixes are,\n\nBody parts are inalienably possessed, requiring a possessive adjective prefix to complete them, so one cannot say \"head\" alone, but only \"my, or his, or your, etc. head\".\n\nThe basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):\n'This' and 'that' are distinguished as \"k-\" and \"t-\". \n\nJudging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two cardinal numbers — one and two — and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.\n\n"}

{"id": "90183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90183", "title": "Altered chord", "text": "Altered chord\n\nAn altered chord is a chord in which one or more notes from the diatonic scale is replaced with a neighboring pitch from the chromatic scale. According to the broadest definition any chord with a nondiatonic chord tone is an altered chord, while the simplest use of altered chords is the use of borrowed chords, chords borrowed from the parallel key, and the most common is the use of secondary dominants. As Alfred Blatter explains,\"An altered chord occurs when one of the standard, functional chords is given another quality by the modification of one or more components of the chord.\"\n\nFor example, altered notes may be used as leading tones to emphasize their diatonic neighbors. Contrast this with chord extensions: \n\nIn jazz harmony, chromatic alteration is either the addition of notes not in the scale or expansion of a [chord] progression by adding extra non-diatonic chords. For example, \"A C major scale with an added D note, for instance, is a chromatically altered scale\" while, \"one bar of Cmaj moving to Fmaj in the next bar can be chromatically altered by adding the ii and V of Fmaj on the second two beats of bar\" one. Techniques include the ii-V-I turnaround, as well as movement by half-step or minor third.\n\nThe five most common types of altered dominants are: V, V (both raised fifths), V, V (both lowered fifths), and V (lowered fifth and third).\n\n\"Borrowing\" of this type is seen in music from the Renaissance music era and the Baroque music era (1600–1750), such as with the use of the Picardy third, in which a piece in a minor key has a final or intermediate cadence in the tonic major chord. \"Borrowing\" is also common in 20th century popular music and rock music.\n\nFor example, in music in a major key, such as C major, composers and songwriters may use a B major chord, which is \"borrowed\" from the key of C minor (where it is the VII chord). Similarly, in music in a minor key, composers and songwriters often \"borrow\" chords from the tonic major. For example, pieces in C minor often use F major and G major (IV and V chords), which are \"borrowed\" from the key of C major.\n\nMore advanced types of altered chords were used by Romantic music era composers in the 19th century, such as Chopin and by jazz composers and improvisers in the 20th and 21st century. For example, the chord progression on the left uses four unaltered chords, while the progression on the right uses an altered IV chord and is an alteration of the previous progression:\n\nThe A in the altered chord serves as a leading tone to G, which is the root of the next chord.\n\nAccording to one definition, \"when a chord is chromatically altered, and the thirds remain large [major] or small [minor], and is not used in modulation, it is an altered chord.\" According to another, \"all chords... having a major third, i.e., either triads, sevenths, or ninths, with the fifth chromatically raised or chromatically lowered, are altered chords,\" while triads with a single altered note are considered, \"changes of form <nowiki>[</nowiki>quality],\" rather than alteration.\n\nAccording to composer Percy Goetschius, \"Altered... chords contain one or more tones written with accidentals (, , or ) and therefore foreign to the scale in which they appear, but nevertheless, from their connections and their effect, obviously belonging to the principal key of their phrase.\" Richard Franko Goldman argues that, once one accepts, \"the variability of the scale,\" the concept of altered chords becomes unnecessary: \"In reality, there is nothing 'altered' about them; they are entirely natural elements of a single key system,\" and it is, \"not necessary,\" to use the term as each 'altered chord' is, \"simply one of the possibilities regularly existing and employed.\"\n\nDan Haerle argues that only fifths and ninths may be altered, as all other alterations may be interpreted as an unaltered chord tone or, enharmonically, as an altered fifth or ninth (for example, 1 = 9 and 4 = 3).\n\nAn altered seventh chord is a seventh chord with one, or all, of its factors raised or lowered by a semitone (altered), for example, the augmented seventh chord (7+ or 7+5) featuring a raised fifth (C: C–E–G–B). Most likely the fifth, then the ninth, then the thirteenth. All secondary dominants are altered chords. In classical music, the raised fifth is more common than the lowered fifth, which in a dominant chord adds Phrygian flavor through the introduction of .\nAn altered dominant chord is, \"a dominant triad of a 7th chord that contains a raised or lowered fifth and sometimes a lowered 3rd.\" According to Dan Haerle, \"Generally, altered dominants can be divided into three main groups: altered 5th, altered 9th, and altered 5th and 9th.\" This definition allows three to five options, including the original:\n\nAlfred Music gives nine options for altered dominants, the last four of which contain two alterations each:\nPianist Noah Baerman writes that \"The point of having an altered note in a dominant chord is to build more tension (leading to a correspondingly more powerful resolution).\"\n\nIn jazz, the term \"altered chord\", notated as an \"alt\" chord (e.g. G), refers to a dominant chord, in which neither the fifth nor the ninth is unaltered—namely, where the 5th and the 9th are raised or lowered by a single semitone, or omitted. Altered chords are thus constructed using the following notes, some of which may be omitted:\n\n\nAltered chords may include \"both\" a flattened and sharpened form of the altered fifth or ninth, e.g. G; however, it is more common to use only one such alteration per tone, e.g. G, G, G, or G.\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nIn practice, many fake books do not specify all the alterations; the chord is typically just labelled as G, and the alteration of 9ths, 11ths and 13ths is left to the artistic discretion of the comping musician. The use of chords labeled \"G\" can create challenges in jazz ensembles where more than one chordal instrument are playing chords (e.g., a large band with an electric guitar player and a Hammond organ player), because the guitarist might interpret a G chord as containing a 9 and 13, whereas the organ player may interpret the same chord as containing a 9 and a 13; this can lead to clashing harmonies. To deal with this issue, bands with more than one chordal instrument may work out the alt chord voicings beforehand or alternate playing of choruses.\n\nThe choice of inversion, or the omission of certain tones within the chord (e.g. omitting the root, common in jazz harmony and chord voicings), can lead to many different possible colorings, substitutions, and enharmonic equivalents. Altered chords are ambiguous harmonically, and may play a variety of roles, depending on such factors as voicing, modulation, and voice leading.\n\nThe altered chord's harmony is built on the altered scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C), which includes all the alterations shown in the chord elements above:\n\n\nBecause they do not have natural fifths, altered dominant (7alt) chords support tritone substitution (5 substitution). Thus, the 7alt chord on a given root can be substituted with the 1311 chord on the root a tritone away (e.g., G is the same as D). \n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\n\n"}

Barada was a geologist, and was the second son and third child of Durga Charan Gupta. He had one brother and two sisters.\n\nAfter completing his education from the National Council of Education West Bengal (the first nationalistic technical institute), he joined the Geological Survey of India working with Mr. Heron, the geologist in the capacity of field supervisor. At GSI he was involved in field surveys for mineral resource of India and traveled extensively across the country, staying in different states like Bihar, Rajputana, Orissa in places like Mewar, Jaisagar and Telinagar etc. His surveys included the examination of the wolfram deposit in Orissa and the granite sheet jointing and quartzite ridge survey in the Aravalli Range, which are still used. \nThe evidence of his detailed study on the field of rocks and minerals can be found in the different memoirs published at that time by the GSI and other field notes now in possession of his family.\n\nAs a Gandhian, Barada Gupta learned to use the charkha spinning wheel to make bundles of thread, which his wife Nanibala Gupta also practiced. According to his sons and daughters, when the family went shopping for Puja clothes, he insisted on khādī and he would sweep aside the imported colourful, soft, shimmering, fabrics.\n\nHe was awarded the Rai Saheb Title from the British Government for visionary leadership and exemplary service to the nation. But Gupta declined the title and discouraged people from even mentioning it.\n\nGupta was part of a movement that aimed to disprove the label of effeminacy that the British had imposed upon the Bengalis. Centres of physical training, wrestling and yoga had come up all over Bengal, with the militant Swadeshi movement often operating out of these. Gupta was part of a group that claimed that the regeneration of masculinity was critical to the spirit of anti-colonial nationalism. He also promoted youth sports. Along with his hectic work schedule which involved an average of 6 months of touring per year, he initiated and organized an annual football event, the Tarini Charan Memorial Shield, where players from adjoining states would travel to Rangpur. Tarini Charan, whose name the shield bore, had sponsored his school education when Gupta lost his father at a young age.\n\nGupta was a member of the \"Sabujpatra\" group. He wrote in the \"Cholitobhasha\", or Standard Colloquial Bengali dialect that was showcased and promoted by \"Sabujpatra\" and which is today the standard Bengali writing style. Gupta authored the essay 'Samajik Sahitya' which appeared in Volume V, Issue 12 of \"Sabujpatra\" (1918). His contributions to the different volumes of \"Sabujpatra\" and some new prose was collected and published as Shashwata Tarun, to which Pramatha Chowdhury wrote the Introduction and Rabindranath Tagore the foreword. Gupta authored a second book which is preserved in its manuscript form.\n\nBarada Charan Gupta died on December 20, 1955 at the early age of 62 due to a sudden cardiac failure while taking his regular early morning walk.\n"}

It is typically classified as a dialect of Shughni, but is quite distinct. Within Bartangi, there are two (sub)dialects, Basid and Sipandzh, which are named after the villages in which they are spoken. It is not written. \n\nAs of 1990, there are between 2,500 and 3,000 speakers of Bartangi. While the population continues to grow, civil war and Russian efforts to assimilate the Bartangi or move them to cities have caused the language to dwindle. In addition, the popularity of Tajik and Russian as the languages of education and modernization have contributed to the decline of Bartangi.\n\nBartangi is most similar to Rushani and Orosori, two neighboring Sughni dialects. Features that distinguish them include the form of the second person, a \"tu\" tense in Bartangi, and the Bartangi plural suffix \"-en\".\n\nThe language was unknown to Europe until the early twentieth century, when French linguist Robert Gauthiot published his findings on the area in his 1916 essay \"Notes sur le yazgoulami, dialecte iranien des confins du Pamir.\"\nAfter the discovery of the Bartangi people, there was an increase in interest in the Shughni provinces, but due to the difficult landscape, very few explorers visited the area, and publications on the language dropped off, though in 1924 a Bartangi lullaby was printed. \n\nThe next major European involvement in the area was by the Russians, who over the course of the nineteenth century had conquered parts of Tajikistan until its formal declaration as the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in 1929. Despite Tajikistan declaring independence in 1991, permanent Russian influence in language, culture, and politics have led to the loss of several Pamir languages. Tajik, an Iranian language which is the national language of Tajikistan, serves as a common language through all Tajik provinces. In addition, with a 96% literacy rate throughout the province, even the isolated region of Bartang is well-versed in the national languages of Tajik, Uzbek, and Russian. Russian is currently the language of education and the intelligentsia in Tajikistan, and the influence of these larger languages are required for communication between speakers of the various Pamir languages. \n\nWar has also contributed to substantial decline of the Shughni languages, and Bartangi is no exception. World War II, conflicts between Shughni villages, and the civil war which ravished the province from 1992 to 1997, all contributed to the diminishing status of the language. In addition to wiping out portions of the population, the war forced many of the Pamir inhabitants out of their native lands and into cities, where their languages are of little use. The 1950s also saw massive resettlement of Bartang people, though the population has been increasing since 1959.\n\n"}
{"id": "53391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53391", "title": "Befunge", "text": "Befunge\n\nBefunge is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid. \"Arrow\" instructions direct the control flow to the left, right, up or down, and loops are constructed by sending the control flow in a cycle. It has been described as \"a cross between Forth and Lemmings.\"\n\nThe language was originally created by Chris Pressey in 1993 for the Amiga, as an attempt to devise a language which is as hard to compile as possible. Note that the codice_1 command allows for self-modifying code. Nevertheless, a number of compilers have subsequently been written. A number of extensions to the original \"Befunge-93\" specification also exist, most notably Funge-98, which extends the concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions and can be multithreaded, with multiple instruction pointers operating simultaneously on the same space. Befunge-extensions and variants are called \"Fungeoids\" or just \"Funges\".\n\nThe Befunge-93 specification restricts each valid program to a grid of 80 instructions horizontally by 25 instructions vertically. Program execution which exceeds these limits \"wraps around\" to a corresponding point on the other side of the grid; a Befunge program is in this manner topologically equivalent to a torus. Since a Befunge-93 program can only have a single stack and its storage array is bounded, the Befunge-93 language is not Turing-complete (however, it has been shown that Befunge-93 is Turing Complete with unbounded stack word size). The later Funge-98 specification provides Turing completeness by removing the size restrictions on the program; rather than wrapping around at a fixed limit, the movement of a Funge-98 instruction pointer follows a model dubbed \"Lahey-space\" after its originator, Chris Lahey. In this model, the grid behaves like a torus of finite size with respect to wrapping, while still allowing itself to be extended indefinitely.\n\nAs stated, the design goal for Befunge was to create a language which was difficult to compile. This was attempted with the implementation of self-modifying code (the 'p' instruction can write new instructions into the playfield) and a multi-dimensional playfield (the same instruction can be executed in four different directions).\n\nNevertheless, these obstacles have been overcome, to some degree, and Befunge compilers have been written using appropriate techniques.\n\nThe bef2c compiler included with the standard Befunge-93 distribution uses threaded code: each instruction is compiled to a snippet of C code, and control flows through the snippets just as it does in a Befunge interpreter (that is, conditionally on the value of some 'direction' register). This does not result in a significant advantage over a good interpreter. Note that the bef2c compiler is not correct since it does not handle either 'p' or string mode, but it would not be impossible to make it do so (although the C language might not be well-suited for this).\n\nThe Betty compiler, for example, treats every possible straight line of instructions as a subprogram, and if a 'p' instruction alters that subprogram, that subprogram is recompiled. This is an interesting variation on just-in-time compilation, and it results in a much better advantage over an interpreter, since many instructions can be executed in native code without making intervening decisions on the 'direction' register.\n\nThe technique of using arrows to change control flow is demonstrated in the random number generator program below. The Befunge instruction pointer begins in the upper left corner and will travel to the right if not redirected. Following the arrows around, the codice_2 instructions send the instruction pointer in random cardinal directions until the pointer hits a digit, pushing it to the stack. Then the arrows navigate to the codice_3 to output the digit from the stack and return the pointer to the first directional randomiser. There is no codice_4 to terminate this program, so it produces an endless stream of random numbers from 1 to 9.\n\nThe following code is an example of the classic \"Hello World!\" program. First the letters \"olleH\" are pushed onto the stack as ASCII numbers. These are then popped from the stack in LIFO order and output as text characters to give \"Hello\". A space is character number 32 in ASCII, which here is constructed by multiplying 4 and 8, before being output as text. The remaining code then outputs \"World!\" in a similar way, followed by ASCII character 10 (a line feed character, moving the output cursor to a new line).\n\nThe following code is a slightly more complicated version. It adds the ASCII character 10 (a line feed character) to the stack, and then pushes \"!dlrow ,olleH\" to the stack. Again, LIFO ordering means that \"H\" is now the top of the stack and will be the first printed, \"e\" is second, and so on. To print the characters, the program enters a loop that first duplicates the top value on the stack (so now the stack would look like \"\\n!dlrow ,olleHH\"). Then the \"_\" operation will pop the duplicated value, and go right if it's a zero, left otherwise. (This assumes a compliant interpreter that \"returns\" 0 when popping an empty stack.) When it goes left, it pops and prints the top value as an ASCII character. It then duplicates the next character and loops back to the \"_\" test, continuing to print the rest of the stack until it is empty and so the next value popped is 0, at which point \"@\" ends the program.\nMost one-dimensional programming languages require some syntactic distinction between comment text and source code — although that distinction may be as trivial as Brainfuck's rule that any character not in the set codice_5 is a comment. Languages like Lisp and Python treat strings as comments in contexts where the values are not used. Similarly, in Befunge, there is no comment syntax: to embed documentation in the code, the programmer simply routes the control flow \"around\" the \"comment\" area, so that the text in that area is never executed.\n\n\n"}

It should not be confused with Tatar proper, spoken in Tatarstan and adjacent regions in Russia; the languages are related, but belong to two different subgroups of the Kipchak languages and thus are not mutually intelligible. Crimean Tatar arrived in the 13th century with the Mongol Golden Horde, succeeding the Crimean Greek and Crimean Gothic Principality of Theodoro, and continued through the 15th–18th century Crimean Khanate period. Though only distantly related, it has been extensively influenced by nearby Oghuz Turkic languages such as Turkish, Turkmen and Azerbaijani.\n\nToday, more than 260,000 Crimean Tatars live in Crimea. Approximately 150,000 reside in Central Asia (mainly in Uzbekistan), where their ancestors had been exiled in 1944 during World War II by the Soviet Union. However, of all these people, mostly the older generations are the only ones still speaking Crimean Tatar. In 2013, the language was estimated to be on the brink of extinction, being taught in only around 15 schools in Crimea. Turkey has provided support to Ukraine, to aid in bringing the schools teaching in Crimean Tatar to a modern state.\nAn estimated 5 million people of Crimean origin live in Turkey, descendants of those who emigrated in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Of these an estimated 2,000 still speak the language. Smaller Crimean Tatar communities are also found in Romania (22,000), Bulgaria (6,000), and the United States. Crimean Tatar is one of the seriously endangered languages in Europe.\n\nAlmost all Crimean Tatars are bilingual or multilingual, using as their first language the dominant languages of their respective home countries, such as Russian, Turkish, Romanian, Uzbek, Bulgarian or Ukrainian.\n\nCrimean Tatar is conventionally divided into three main dialects: northern, middle and southern.\n\nThe middle dialect is spoken in the Crimean Mountains by the sedentary \"Tat\" Tatars (should not be confused with the Tat people which speak an Iranic language). The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on Tat Tatar because the Tat Tatars comprise a relative majority.\n\nStandard Crimean Tatar and its middle dialect classified as a language of the Cuman () subgroup of the Kipchak languages and the closest relatives are Karachay-Balkar, Karaim, Krymchak, Kumyk, Urum and extinct Cuman.\n\nHowever, two other unwritten dialects of Crimean Tatar belong to two different groups or subgroups of the Turkic languages.\n\nThe northern dialect (also known as steppe or Nogay) is spoken by the \"Noğay\" ethnic subgroup, the former nomadic inhabitants of the Crimean (Nogay) steppe (should not be confused with Nogai people of the Northern Caucasus and the Lower Volga). This dialect belongs to the Nogay () subgroup of the Kipchak languages. This subgroups also includes Kazakh, Karakalpak, Kyrgyz, and Nogai proper. It is thought that the Nogays of the Crimea and the Nogais of the Caucasus and Volga are of common origin from the Nogai Horde, which is reflected in their common name and very closely related languages. In the past some speakers of this dialects also called themselves \"Qıpçaq\" (that is Cumans).\n\nThe southern or coastal dialects is spoken by \"Yalıboylu\" (\"coastal dwellers\") who have traditionally lived on the southern coast of the Crimea. Their dialects belongs to the Oghuz group of the Turkic languages which includes Turkish, Azeri and Turkmen. This dialect is most heavily influenced by Turkish.\n\nThus, Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages, because its three \"dialects\" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult. The middle dialect, although thought to be of Kipchak-Cuman origin, is in fact combine elements of both Cuman and Oghuz languages. This latter fact may also be another reason why Standard Crimean Tatar has had its basis in the middle dialect.\n\nBecause of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of Tatar proper, or both being two dialects of the same language. However, Tatar spoken in Tatarstan and the Volga-Ural region of Russian belongs to the different Bulgaric () subgroup of the Kipchak languages, and its closet relative is Bashkir. Both Volga Tatar and Bashkir differ notably from Crimean Tatar, particularly because of the specific Volga-Ural Turkic vocalism and historical shifts.\n\nThe formation period of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects began with the first Turkic invasions of Crimea by Cumans and Pechenegs and ended during the period of the Crimean Khanate. However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were Chagatai and Ottoman Turkish. After Islamization, Crimean Tatars wrote with an Arabic script.\n\nIn 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by Ismail Gasprinski. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. In 1928, the language was reoriented to the middle dialect spoken by the majority of the people.\n\nIn 1928, the alphabet was replaced with the Uniform Turkic Alphabet based on the Latin script. The Uniform Turkic Alphabet was replaced in 1938 by a Cyrillic alphabet. During the 1990s and 2000s, the government of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea under Ukraine encouraged replacing the script with a Latin version again, but the Cyrillic has still been widely used (mainly in published literature, newspapers and education). The current Latin-based Crimean Tatar alphabet is the same as the Turkish alphabet, with two additional characters: Ñ ñ and Q q. Currently, in the Russian Republic of Crimea all official communications and education in Crimean Tatar are conducted exclusively in the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nCrimean Tatar was the native language of the poet Bekir Çoban-zade.\n\nThe vowel system of Crimean Tatar is similar to some other Turkic languages. Because high vowels in Crimean Tatar are short and reduced, and are realized close to , even though they are phonologically distinct.\n\nIn addition to these phonemes, Crimean also displays marginal phonemes that occur in borrowed words, especially palatalized consonants.\n\nThe southern (coastal) dialect substitutes for , e.g. standard \"qara\" 'black', southern \"xara\".\nAt the same time the southern and some central dialects preserve glottal which is pronounced in the standard language. The northern dialect on the contrary lacks and , substituting for and for . The northern is usually , often in the place of , compare standard \"dağ\" and northern \"taw\" 'mountain' (also in other Oghuz and Kipchak languages, such as and ).\n\nCrimean Tatar can be written in either the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets, both modified to the specific needs of Crimean Tatar, and either used respective to where the language is used. Under Ukrainian rule, the Latin alphabet was preferred, but upon Russia's annexation of the Crimea, Cyrillic became the sole official script.\n\nCrimean Tatars used Arabic script from 16th century to 1928.\n\nÂ â symbol is not considered to be a separate letter.\n\nгъ, къ, нъ and дж are separate letters (digraphs).\n\nAccording to the constitution of the Republic of Crimea and the Crimean language law, the Crimean Tatar language is an official language in Crimea as well as Russian and Ukrainian.\n\nAccording to the constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, as published in Russian by its Verkhovna Rada, Russian and Crimean Tatar languages enjoy a \"protected\" () status; every citizen is entitled, at his request (), to receive government documents, such as \"Passport, Birth certificate and others\" in Crimean Tatar. According to the constitution of Ukraine, however, Ukrainian is the only official language in all of Ukraine. Recognition of Russian and Crimean Tatar was a matter of political and legal debate.\n\nBefore the Sürgün, the 18 May 1944 deportation by the Soviet Union of Crimean Tatars to internal exile in Uzbek SSR, Crimean Tatar had an official language status in the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\n\n"}

His nickname, \"Dallán\" (\"little blind one\"), was earned after he lost his sight, reputedly as a result of studying intensively.\n\nHe was born in Maigen (now Ballyconnell), at the eastern edge of the territory of the Masraige of Magh Slécht in modern County Cavan. He was not a member of the Masraige but belonged to a branch of the Airgíalla called the Fir Lurg, who were in the process of spreading southwards into Fermanagh and Cavan. (The barony of Lurg in County Fermanagh was named after them) His was a first cousin of Saint Mogue. (The \"Life of Máedóc of Ferns\" says in ch. 72 that Dallán and Máedóc were sons of two brothers and he lived in Kildallan townland.) He was also a fourth cousin of Tigernach of Clones.\n\nThe \"Amhra Coluim Cille\", a panegyric on Columba, written shortly after Columba's death in 597, is his best known work and considered \"one of the most important poems we have from the early medieval Gaelic world\". It is reported that after completing the work, Dallan regained his sight. It was claimed that those who recited the praises of Columba from memory would receive the gift of a happy death, a custom that was widely abused by those who attempted to rely on their memory rather than a virtuous life. The \"Amhra Coluim Cille\" became a popular text for students in Irish monasteries.\n\nThe \"Amra Senáin\", a funeral oration in praise of Senán mac Geirrcinn (Senán of Iniscattery), was said to preserve from blindness those who recited it with devotion.\n\nIn 598 Dallan was visiting his friend Saint Conall Cael at his monastery on Inishkeel when pirates raided the island monastery. Dallan was reportedly beheaded, and it is said that God reattached his head to his body after he was martyred. He was buried on Iniskeel; his friend Canall Cael was later laid to rest in the same grave.\n\nHe was acclaimed a saint in the early 11th century, during the reign of the High King of Ireland Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill but was already listed as a saint in the earlier 9th century martyrologies compiled by Óengus of Tallaght. A medieval poem entitled \"On the breaking up of a School\" composed by Tadhg Og O Huiginn, c.1400, refers to the death of Dallán which caused his school to break up and the students to disperse as they would accept no other master. In a list of ancient Irish authors contained in the Book of Ballymote, Dallán is called “grandson of testimony”.\n\nSaint Dallan was a poet, Chief Ollam of Ireland, as well as a scholar of Latin scriptural learning. He helped to reform the Bardic Order at the Convention of Drumceat.\n\nIn addition to Amra Choluim Chille and Amra Senáin, the following works are attributed to Dallán, although some may be later works by other poets who credited Dallan with authorship in order to make their poems more famous.\n\n1.

The common practice of entertaining a guest in the home led to the creation of this category of plays and while the drawing room itself has fallen out of favour, the play format has continued to provide a source of entertainment. \n\nWhile there is no date or authority directly ascribed to the term drawing room play, there is evidence that the term was derived from the English habit of putting on these short works for guests while entertaining in the drawing room of the home. In French usage the room and the social gathering it contained are equally the salon.\n\nBeginning with the early forms of drama, the drawing room play has evolved to encompass comedy as well as to include the forms of the dramatic monologue. The play format itself has also grown out of the traditional drawing room performance and back into main street theatre and film. Drawing room comedy is also sometimes called the \"comedy of manners.\" Many of the Drawing Room Plays adapted some form of social criticism in the transition from the Victorian period into the Modern era.\n\n\n\nNicholas Cooper, Houses of the Gentry 1480-1680 (English Heritage) 1999: \"Parlours and withdrawing rooms 289-93.\n"}

It limited the type of instruction available to English language learner (ELL) students. Before Proposition 203, schools were free in terms of ELL instruction to use bilingual or immersion methods. According to a cover letter from the Arizona Department of Education Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan to the Arizona Legislature, it was impossible to make a correct analysis regarding how many students were learning through English as a second language programs, as opposed to bilingual education. The school districts had submitted \"conflicting information,\" and 40% had not submitted any data, in spite of three deadline extensions. \n\nProposition 203, like the similar California Proposition 227, was named after its financial supporter Ron Unz, a Silicon Valley software entrepreneur. 61% of the voters had passed Proposition 227. Arizona, Massachusetts, and Colorado followed with similar campaigns directed by Unz. On November 5, 2002, Question 2 in Massachusetts was passed by 68% of the voters, but Amendment 31 in Colorado was rejected by 56% of the voters. Unz's goal was to replace bilingual education with structured or sheltered English immersion programs. The book \"English for the Children: Mandated by the People, Skewed by Politicians and Special Interests\" by Johanna J. Haver (Rowman & Littlefield Education, 2013) reconstructs the politics surrounding Unz's movement and its effects on the education of ELLs.\n\nThe actual text of the legislation begins with declarations regarding the importance of English and learning English. It goes on to state that immigrant parents want their children to acquire \"a good knowledge of English,\" allowing them to \"fully participate in the American dream.\" It explains that the government and Arizona public schools have a moral responsibility to \"provide all of Arizona's children... with the skills necessary to become productive members of our society.\" It elaborates that public schools \"currently do an inadequate job of educating immigrant children\" by \"experimental language programs whose failure over the past two decades is demonstrated by the current high drop-out rates and low English literacy levels of many immigrant children.\" It makes the point that \"young immigrant children can easily acquire full fluency in a new language, such as English, if they are heavily exposed to that language in the classroom at an early age.\" \n\nThe resolution states that \"all children in Arizona public schools shall be taught English as rapidly and effectively as possible.\" ELLs should be educated in immersion programs during a temporary transition period \"not normally intended to exceed one year.\" A parent may request for his or her child to be exempt if it can be determined that the child already knows English, the child is ten years old or older, or the child is identified as having special needs. However, for a child to claim to have special needs, it must be confirmed that education in English is not the best option for the child.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" ran a front-page story in August prior to the November 2000 election, showing that California's version of the initiative, Proposition 227, had been highly successful, with a rise in standardized test scores among English language learners after two years. In spite of noted bilingual education theorists' arguments, disputing the particulars of the article, the \"Times\" story is believed to have strongly affected public opinion and the passage of Arizona Proposition 203.\n\nImplementation of the policy was scheduled to occur at the beginning of the 2001-2002 school year. There was widespread confusion throughout the state because of differences of opinion regarding the language used in the text of the proposition. Following the implementation, some schools changed their approach to educating ELLs, but several districts obtained waivers for their ELL students and continued their bilingual education programs. For the most part, neither the bilingual nor the immersion programs were in compliance with the law. Fewer than 11% of the state's ELL students achieved proficiency in a year's time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "105979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=105979", "title": "Exclusive or", "text": "Exclusive or\n\nExclusive or or exclusive disjunction is a logical operation that outputs true only when inputs differ (one is true, the other is false).\n\nIt is symbolized by the prefix operator J and by the infix operators XOR (), EOR, EXOR, ⊻, ⩒, ⩛, ⊕, ↮, and ≢. The negation of XOR is logical biconditional, which outputs true only when both inputs are the same.\n\nIt gains the name \"exclusive or\" because the meaning of \"or\" is ambiguous when both operands are true; the exclusive or operator \"excludes\" that case. This is sometimes thought of as \"one or the other but not both\". This could be written as \"A or B, but not, A and B\".\n\nMore generally, XOR is true only when an odd number of inputs are true. A chain of XORs—\"a\" XOR \"b\" XOR \"c\" XOR \"d\" (and so on)—is true whenever an odd number of the inputs are true and is false whenever an even number of inputs are true.\n\nThe truth table of A XOR B shows that it outputs true whenever the inputs differ:\n\n\nExclusive disjunction essentially means 'either one, but not both nor none'. In other words, the statement is true if and only if one is true and the other is false. For example, if two horses are racing, then one of the two will win the race, but not both of them. The exclusive disjunction formula_1, also denoted by formula_2 ⩛ formula_3 or formula_4, can be expressed in terms of the logical conjunction (\"logical and\", formula_5), the disjunction (\"logical or\", formula_6), and the negation (formula_7) as follows:\n\nThe exclusive disjunction formula_1 can also be expressed in the following way:\n\nThis representation of XOR may be found useful when constructing a circuit or network, because it has only one formula_7 operation and small number of formula_5 and formula_6 operations. A proof of this identity is given below:\n\nIt is sometimes useful to write formula_1 in the following way:\nor:\n\nThis equivalence can be established by applying De Morgan's laws twice to the fourth line of the above proof.\n\nThe exclusive or is also equivalent to the negation of a logical biconditional, by the rules of material implication (a material conditional is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of its antecedent and its consequence) and material equivalence.\n\nIn summary, we have, in mathematical and in engineering notation:\n\nAlthough the operators formula_5 (conjunction) and formula_6 (disjunction) are very useful in logic systems, they fail a more generalizable structure in the following way:\n\nThe systems formula_21 and formula_22 are monoids, but neither is a group. This unfortunately prevents the combination of these two systems into larger structures, such as a mathematical ring.\n\nHowever, the system using exclusive or formula_23 is an abelian group. The combination of operators formula_5 and formula_25 over elements formula_26 produce the well-known field formula_27. This field can represent any logic obtainable with the system formula_28 and has the added benefit of the arsenal of algebraic analysis tools for fields.\n\nMore specifically, if one associates formula_29 with 0 and formula_30 with 1, one can interpret the logical \"AND\" operation as multiplication on formula_27 and the \"XOR\" operation as addition on formula_27:\n\nUsing this basis to describe a boolean system is referred to as algebraic normal form.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary explains \"either ... or\" as follows:\nThe exclusive-or explicitly states \"one or the other, but not neither nor both.\" However, the mapping correspondence between formal Boolean operators and natural language conjunctions is far from simple or one-to-one, and has been studied for decades in linguistics and analytic philosophy.\n\nFollowing this kind of common-sense intuition about \"or\", it is sometimes argued that in many natural languages, English included, the word \"or\" has an \"exclusive\" sense. The exclusive disjunction of a pair of propositions, (\"p\", \"q\"), is supposed to mean that \"p\" is true or \"q\" is true, but not both. For example, it might be argued that the normal intention of a statement like \"You may have coffee, or you may have tea\" is to stipulate that exactly one of the conditions can be true. Certainly under some circumstances a sentence like this example should be taken as forbidding the possibility of one's accepting both options. Even so, there is good reason to suppose that this sort of sentence is not disjunctive at all. If all we know about some disjunction is that it is true overall, we cannot be sure which of its disjuncts is true. For example, if a woman has been told that her friend is either at the snack bar or on the tennis court, she cannot validly infer that he is on the tennis court. But if her waiter tells her that she may have coffee or she may have tea, she can validly infer that she may have tea. Nothing classically thought of as a disjunction has this property. This is so even given that she might reasonably take her waiter as having denied her the possibility of having both coffee and tea.\n\nIn English, the construct \"either ... or\" is usually used to indicate exclusive or and \"or\" generally used for inclusive. But in Spanish, the word \"\"o\" (or) can be used in the form \"p o q\" (exclusive) or the form \"o p o q\"\" (inclusive). Some may contend that any binary or other n-ary exclusive \"or\" is true if and only if it has an odd number of true inputs (this is not, however, the only reasonable definition; for example, digital xor gates with multiple inputs typically do not use that definition), and that there is no conjunction in English that has this general property. For example, Barrett and Stenner contend in the 1971 article \"The Myth of the Exclusive 'Or (Mind, 80 (317), 116–121) that no author has produced an example of an English or-sentence that appears to be false because both of its inputs are true, and brush off or-sentences such as \"The light bulb is either on or off\" as reflecting particular facts about the world rather than the nature of the word \"or\". However, the \"barber paradox\"—Everybody in town shaves himself or is shaved by the barber, who shaves the barber? -- would not be paradoxical if \"or\" could not be exclusive (although a purist could say that \"either\" is required in the statement of the paradox).\n\nWhether these examples can be considered \"natural language\" is another question. Certainly when one sees a menu stating \"Lunch special: sandwich and soup or salad\" (parsed as \"sandwich and (soup or salad)\" according to common usage in the restaurant trade), one would not expect to be permitted to order both soup and salad. Nor would one expect to order neither soup nor salad, because that belies the nature of the \"special\", that ordering the two items together is cheaper than ordering them a la carte. Similarly, a lunch special consisting of one meat, French fries or mashed potatoes and vegetable would consist of three items, only one of which would be a form of potato. If one wanted to have meat and both kinds of potatoes, one would ask if it were possible to substitute a second order of potatoes for the vegetable. And, one would not expect to be permitted to have both types of potato and vegetable, because the result would be a vegetable plate rather than a meat plate.\n\nThe symbol used for exclusive disjunction varies from one field of application to the next, and even depends on the properties being emphasized in a given context of discussion. In addition to the abbreviation \"XOR\", any of the following symbols may also be seen:\n\nIf using binary values for true (1) and false (0), then \"exclusive or\" works exactly like addition modulo 2.\n\nExclusive disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:\n\nAs noted above, since exclusive disjunction is identical to addition modulo 2, the bitwise exclusive disjunction of two \"n\"-bit strings is identical to the standard vector of addition in the vector space formula_38.\n\nIn computer science, exclusive disjunction has several uses:\n\nIn logical circuits, a simple adder can be made with an XOR gate to add the numbers, and a series of AND, OR and NOT gates to create the carry output.\n\nOn some computer architectures, it is more efficient to store a zero in a register by XOR-ing the register with itself (bits XOR-ed with themselves are always zero) instead of loading and storing the value zero.\n\nIn simple threshold activated neural networks, modeling the XOR function requires a second layer because XOR is not a linearly separable function.\n\nExclusive-or is sometimes used as a simple mixing function in cryptography, for example, with one-time pad or Feistel network systems.\n\nExclusive-or is also heavily used in block ciphers such as AES (Rijndael) or Serpent and in block cipher implementation (CBC, CFB, OFB or CTR).\n\nSimilarly, XOR can be used in generating entropy pools for hardware random number generators. The XOR operation preserves randomness, meaning that a random bit XORed with a non-random bit will result in a random bit. Multiple sources of potentially random data can be combined using XOR, and the unpredictability of the output is guaranteed to be at least as good as the best individual source.\n\nXOR is used in RAID 3–6 for creating parity information. For example, RAID can \"back up\" bytes and from two (or more) hard drives by XORing the just mentioned bytes, resulting in () and writing it to another drive. Under this method, if any one of the three hard drives are lost, the lost byte can be re-created by XORing bytes from the remaining drives. For instance, if the drive containing is lost, and can be XORed to recover the lost byte.\n\nXOR is also used to detect an overflow in the result of a signed binary arithmetic operation. If the leftmost retained bit of the result is not the same as the infinite number of digits to the left, then that means overflow occurred. XORing those two bits will give a \"1\" if there is an overflow.\n\nXOR can be used to swap two numeric variables in computers, using the XOR swap algorithm; however this is regarded as more of a curiosity and not encouraged in practice.\n\nXOR linked lists leverage XOR properties in order to save space to represent doubly linked list data structures.\n\nIn computer graphics, XOR-based drawing methods are often used to manage such items as bounding boxes and cursors on systems without alpha channels or overlay planes.\n\nApart from the ASCII codes, the operator is encoded at and , both in block Mathematical Operators.\n\n"}

{"id": "71833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71833", "title": "Kazakh language", "text": "Kazakh language\n\nKazak or Kazakh (Cyrillic: or ; Arabic: or ; , ) belongs to the Kipchak branch of the Turkic languages. It is closely related to Nogai, Kyrgyz, and Karakalpak. Kazak is the official language of the Republic of Kazakstan and a significant minority language in the Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang, China and in the Bayan-Ölgii Province of Mongolia. Kazak is also spoken by many ethnic Kazaks through the former Soviet Union (approximately 472,000 in Russia according to the 2010 Russian Census), Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and Germany.\n\nLike other Turkic languages, Kazak is an agglutinative language, and it employs vowel harmony.\n\nIn October 2017, Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev decreed that the government would transition from using Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet by 2025. President Nazarbayev signed on February 19, 2018 an amendment to the decree of October 26, 2017 No. 569 \"On translating the Kazak alphabet from Cyrillic alphabet to the Latin script.\" The amended alphabet uses Sh and Ch for the Kazak sounds \"Ш\" and \"Ч\" and eliminates the use of apostrophes.\n\nThe Kazak language has its speakers (mainly Kazaks) spread over a vast territory from the Tian Shan to the western shore of the Caspian Sea. Kazak is the official state language of Kazakstan, with nearly 10 million speakers (based on information from the CIA World Factbook on population and the proportion of Kazakh speakers). In China, more than one million ethnic Kazaks and Kazak speakers reside in the Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang.\n\nThe oldest known written records of languages closely related to Kazak were written in the Old Turkic alphabet, though it is not believed that any of these varieties were direct predecessors of Kazak. Modern Kazak, going back approximately one thousand years, was written in the Arabic script until 1929, when Soviet authorities introduced a Latin-based alphabet, and then a Cyrillic in 1940. In presenting a strategic plan in April 2017, Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev described the twentieth century as a period in which the \"Kazak language and culture have been devastated.\" Nazarbayev ordered Kazak authorities to create a Latin Kazak alphabet by the end of 2017, so written Kazak could return to a Latin script starting in 2018. , Kazak is written in Cyrillic in Kazakstan and Mongolia, Kazak is written in Latin in Kazakhstan, while more than one million Kazak speakers in China use an Arabic-derived alphabet similar to the one that is used to write Uyghur. On October 26, 2017, Nazarbayev issued Presidential Decree 569 for the change to a finalized Latin variant of the Kazak alphabet and ordered that the government's transition to this alphabet be completed by 2025, a decision taken to emphasise Kazak culture after the era of Soviet rule and to facilitate the use of digital devices. But the initial decision to use a novel orthography employing apostrophes, which make the use of many popular tools for searching and writing text difficult, has generated controversy. The alphabet was revised the following year by Presidential Decree 637 of 19 February 2018 and the use of apostrophes was discontinued and replaced with the use of diacritics and digraphs.\nNazarbayev first brought up the topic of using the Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillic alphabet as the official script for Kazak in Kazakstan in October 2006. A Kazak government study released in September 2007 said that a switch to a Latin script over a 10- to 12-year period was feasible, at a cost of $300 million. The transition was halted temporarily on December 13, 2007, with President Nazarbayev declaring: \"For 70 years the Kazakstanis read and wrote in Cyrillic. More than 100 nationalities live in our state. Thus we need stability and peace. We should be in no hurry in the issue of alphabet transformation.\" However, on January 30, 2015, the Minister of Culture and Sports Arystanbek Mukhamediuly announced that a transition plan was underway, with specialists working on the orthography in order to accommodate the phonological aspects of the language.\n\nHowever, many citizens state that the officially introduced alphabet needs lots of improvements and changes. Moreover, Kazak becomes the only Turkic language which will be using Sh, Ch, after the intentions of the Uzbek government to abandon the Sh, Ch digraphs due to its impracticality.\n\nKazak exhibits tongue-root vowel harmony, with some words of recent foreign origin (usually of Russian or Arabic origin) as exceptions. There is also a system of rounding harmony which resembles that of Kyrgyz, but which does not apply as strongly and is not reflected in the orthography.\n\nThe following chart depicts the consonant inventory of standard Kazak; many of the sounds, however, are allophones of other sounds or appear only in recent loan-words. For example, /q/ is allophone to /k/, and // is allophone to /g/, // to /ɕ/, and // to /ʑ/. The 18 consonant phonemes listed by Vajda are without parentheses—since these are phonemes, their listed place and manner of articulation are very general, and will vary from what is shown. The borrowed phonemes , , and , only occur in recent borrowings, mostly from Russian. Non-Kazak sounds are in square brackets. \n\nIn the table, the elements left of a divide are voiceless, while those to the right are voiced.\n\nKazak has a system of 12 phonemic vowels, 3 of which are diphthongs. The rounding contrast and generally only occur as phonemes in the first syllable of a word, but do occur later allophonically; see the section on harmony below for more information. Moreover, the sound has been included artificially due to the influence of Arabic, Persian and, later, Tatar languages during the Islamic period. \n\nAccording to Vajda, the front/back quality of vowels is actually one of neutral versus retracted tongue root.\n\nPhonetic values are paired with the corresponding character in Kazak's Cyrillic and current Latin alphabets.\nThe problem of the diphthongs:\n\n\nKazak is generally verb-final, though various permutations on SOV (subject–object–verb) word order can be used, depending on the logically stressed part of the sentence. Inflectional and derivational morphology, both verbal and nominal, in Kazak, exists almost exclusively in the form of agglutinative suffixes. Kazak is a nominative-accusative, head-final, left-branching, dependent-marking language.\n\nKazak has eight personal pronouns:\n\nThe declension of the pronouns is outlined in the following chart. Singular pronouns (with the exception of сіз, which used to be plural) exhibit irregularities, while plural pronouns don't. Irregular forms are highlighted in bold.\n\nIn addition to the pronouns, there are several more sets of morphemes dealing with person.\n\nKazak may express different combinations of tense, aspect and mood through the use of various verbal morphology or through a system of auxiliary verbs, many of which might better be considered light verbs. The present tense is a prime example of this; progressive tense in Kazak is formed with one of four possible auxiliaries. These auxiliaries \"отыр\" (sit), \"тұр\" (stand), \"жүр\" (go) and \"жат\" (lie), encode various shades of meaning of how the action is carried out and also interact with the lexical semantics of the root verb: telic and non-telic actions, semelfactives, durative and non-durative, punctual, etc. There are selectional restrictions on auxiliaries: motion verbs, such as бару (go) and келу (come) may not combine with \"отыр\". Any verb, however, can combine with \"жат\" (lie) to get a progressive tense meaning.\n\nWhile it is possible to think that different categories of aspect govern the choice of auxiliary, it is not so straightforward in Kazak. Auxiliaries are internally sensitive to the lexical semantics of predicates, for example, verbs describing motion:\n\nIn addition to the complexities of the progressive tense, there are many auxiliary-converb pairs that encode a range of aspectual, modal, volitional, evidential and action- modificational meanings\".\" For example, the pattern -ып көру, with the auxiliary verb көру (see), indicates that the subject of the verb attempted or tried to do something (compare the Japanese てみる \"temiru\" construction).\n\nFrom \"Meniń Kazakstanım\" (\"My Kazakstan\"), the national anthem of Kazakstan:\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Muhammad Zaman Khan. He wrote many books on the history of Pushtuns. He was a major figure in contemporary Pushto literature. Roshan Khan was an active member of the movement Khudai Khidmatgar. He was very energetic in the Pakistan Movement and was the president of the Muslim League in Swabi. An area in Swabi, called \"Roshan Pura\" is named after him, where his tomb is also located.\n\nKhan received his primary education from the Islami School Uthmanzai in Charsadda. Later on, he could not complete his further education due to the worse conditions of the times of British Government of India. The changing circumstances diverted his attention towards history. He wrote books on the history of Pathans. These books are \"Tazkira, Pathanon ki Tareekh aur in ki asliat\" which describes the races of Pashtun tribes and their origins. In addition, he wrote \"Yousafzai qaum ki sarguzisht\", which gives details on the various tribes of Pukhtoons. Khan also authored \"Afghano ki nasli tarikh\", which describes the origin of Afghans(Pashtuns) from Bani Israel, (that is, the theory that the Pashtuns are descended from the biblical Israelites). Other booklets include \"Malika-Sawat\",\"Baba-e-qaum Sheikhmali (RA)\" among others. His most important work is \"Tawarikh-e-Hafiz Rehmat Khani\", which includes the details about the biographies of prominent Pukhtoon leaders and elders like Hafiz Rehmat Khan, Hafiz Alpuri(Abdulsamad) of Shangla, Ahmed Shah Abdali, Sardar Mohammad Khan, Dost Muhammad Khan and many others. It also sheds light on the important events and wars of Pukhtoons with other empires and tribes. Moreover, all the family trees of Pashtun tribes are also discussed in this book. He also discussed the brief history of a famous Pashtun tribe, Shalmani.\n\n\nThe book \"Malika-e-Swat\" includes the story of the wedding of Mughal king Babur with the daughter Bibi Mubaraka Yousafzai of Malik Shahmansoor Yusufzai. This book also describes the events and the times when the Yousafzais entered Swat. Their life and the battles which took place between the king of Swat Sultan Awais and the Yusufzai Pathans. The book is mainly about the life and martyrdom of Shaheeda Bibi, who was the sister of Malik Ahmed and was the wife of the king of Swat, Sultan Awais. After her marriage with Sultan Awais she was called the Queen of Sawat.\n\n"}

{"id": "32890322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32890322", "title": "Lars Kepler", "text": "Lars Kepler\n\nLars Kepler is the pseudonym of husband and wife team Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril (b. 1966) and Alexander Ahndoril (b. 1967), authors of the Joona Linna series. With six installments to date, the series has sold twelve million copies in 40 languages. The Ahndorils were both established writers before they adopted the pen name Lars Kepler, and have each published several acclaimed novels.\n\nThe Joona Linna series follows Joona Linna, Detective Superintendent at the police’s National Operations Department, Saga Bauer, an Operational Superintendent at the Swedish Security Service, and Erik Maria Bark (in \"The Hypnotist\" and \"Stalker\"), a trained psychiatrist and psychotherapist specialised in psycho-traumatology and disaster psychiatry.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Lars Kepler’s sixth novel was published in Sweden, a stand-alone novel entitled \"Playground\".\n\nLars is a homage to the Swedish crime fiction author Stieg Larsson as he inspired the duo to start writing crime fiction. The name Kepler comes from the German scientist Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), who solved one of his time’s greatest mysteries: it was his calculations of the planets’ orbits that paved the way for Newton’s theses about gravity.\n\nBritish media first pointed out Henning Mankell as the person behind the pseudonym Lars Kepler, but this was quickly denied by both Mankell himself and Bonniers, the Swedish publisher of Lars Kepler’s books. Several others were also suspected of being the author in question. In August 2009, Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet revealed that the spouses Ahndoril were in fact the ones behind the pseudonym. This was shortly thereafter confirmed by the couple’s publishing house through a press release. That the two created a third, fictional author to represent them can be considered a natural extension of their early individual careers, wherein they both experimented with the blurring of the line between fiction and reality, and incorporating the author as a subject. Most well-known is the example of how Alexander Ahndoril in his novel \"The Director\" (2006) crafted a fictive but plausible story about the director Ingmar Bergman’s life. Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril too has addressed this subject. In an article about the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa, in the magazine Hjärnstorm, she writes about his way of working with so-called heteronyms, a kind of pseudonyms that act as independent individuals. She gives her view of why an author might choose such a trope: “He has created the opportunity to write something that may not be true, but is at least not false. If both writer and feeling are products of the text, then the link between prose and experience remains unbroken\". For the spouses Ahndoril, the pseudonym was a method for writing together without limitations, while the secrecy around it stemmed from a desire to let Lars Kepler stand on his own two legs, and have his books assessed without prejudice.\n\nAlexander grew up in Upplands Väsby, twenty kilometers north of Stockholm. He has always been an avid reader, but wanted to be a painter in his youth. For many years he produced big oil paintings inspired by Caravaggio. He practiced Muay Thai and was accepted into a ranger unit, moved to central Stockholm and studied philosophy, religion, and film at university. His first novel was picked up when he was only nineteen. Before he began writing as Lars Kepler he had already penned nine novels, twenty theatre plays, and one opera libretto.\n\nAlexandra grew up in southern Sweden. She discovered early on that she wanted to become an actress and attended the National Academy of Mime and Acting in Stockholm. She thereafter got a Master’s Degree in literary science, was hired as a PhD student at university, and began writing a dissertation on the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. She produced three historical novels before she began writing together with Alexander.\n\nAlexander and Alexandra married in 1994 and have three daughters together. They live in central Stockholm.\n\nThe Joona Linna novels:\n\n· \"Hypnotisören\" (2009) (English: \"The Hypnotist\")\n\n· \"Paganinikontraktet\" (2010) (English: \"The Nightmare\")\n\n· \"Eldvittnet\" (2011) (English: \"The Fire Witness\")\n\n· \"Sandmannen\" (2012) (English: \"The Sandman\")\n\n· \"Stalker\" (2014) (English: \"Stalker\")\n\n· \"Kaninjägaren\" (2016) (English: \"The Rabbit Hunter\")\n\n· \"Lazarus\" (2018) (English: \"TBA\")\n\nStand-alone works:\n\n· \"Playground\" (2015)\n"}

{"id": "5945959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5945959", "title": "New immigrants in Hong Kong", "text": "New immigrants in Hong Kong\n\nNew immigrants in Hong Kong () generally refers to migrants from mainland China (Mainlanders). Despite its literal meaning, the term is rarely ever used to describe newly arrived immigrants other than the aforementioned one. Since the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to The People's Republic of China, of migrants from mainland China have been coming to the territory.\n\nImmediately after the handover of Hong Kong back to Chinese rule, Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed an amendment to the Basic Law that would restrict immigration to children born outside of Hong Kong that were born to Hong Kong residents. The constitutionality of this amendment came to be challenged in court, and in January 1999, the Court of Final Appeal ruled against the amendment. This ruling immediately granted up to 300,000 people in mainland China the right of abode in Hong Kong, and it was estimated that within the next ten years, about 1.6 million people in mainland China would become eligible for right of abode in Hong Kong.\n\nHei Hang Hayes Tang (2003) gave the following account: after the first influx of refugee capitalists and workers from Mainland China in the late 1940s, Hong Kong experienced another influx in the late 1970s. The migrants of this second wave were mainly young male mainlanders who made their living by working in the manufacturing industry. Being less attractive in the eyes of Hong Kong local born women, many of these young mainlanders generally had to find spouses in Mainland China. Soon after the Mainland government opened its door for economic development and after the signing of Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, there was a massive relocation of industrial activities from Hong Kong to the Pearl River Delta. Such industrial relocation has accentuated the trend of marriage between Hong Kong working-class men and Mainland women (So, 2002). According to the General Household Survey 1991, some 95,200 Hong Kong residents who were married in Mainland China had spouses still in Mainland. It was estimated that 149,500 had children living in China and the total number of children was around 310,000 (fung,1996).\n\nFor working-class newly arrived families, the family reunification process is typically long and difficult with a number of obstacles to overcome. There are complicated procedures and a long waiting time for getting a one-way permit. Therefore, cross-border family members need to formulate their own strategies for immigration and reunification. The families have to plan the ‘best’ time for reunification, decide who will take care of the children, and discuss where and in what school the children should receive their education (Ku, 2001). Rational and strategic use of family resources, including maximisation of family social capital is essential. Middle-class families tend to have an advantage in this process because of the financial capital and cultural capital they accumulated, but it is not the case for working-class newly arrived families.\n\nThe various scenarios in the family reunification process affect the social relations in the family, and therefore impact on the utilisation of family resources as well as its capital accumulation. The scenarios could be:\n1. The mother migrates first, and the children receive education and are taken care of by their grandparents, relatives or school in the Mainland;\n2. The child migrates first, and leaves behind his/her mother and possibly also siblings to join the father in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the latter case, the father needs to take up the role of nurturing which was previously played by the mother. Such a social phenomenon may create tension in family functioning (So, 2002:20). Rao and Yuen (2001) suggest that psychiatric problems in newly arrived students may rise owing to the disruptions in family relations and changes in family ecologies. It is also claimed that home-school co-operation can hardly be established if the mother, who has arrived in Hong Kong, does not know Cantonese.\n\nIn the 2001 case \"Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen\", the Court of Final Appeal held that a boy born in Hong Kong to two mainland parents neither of whom was a Hong Kong resident nevertheless was entitled to the right of abode. \nThe number of children born to non-Hong Kong permanent residents in Hong Kong hospitals has increased almost 100 times from 2001 to the first 10 months of 2006. The number of babies born to mainland mothers soared to 20,000 in the first 10 months of 2006 from less than 9,000 in 2002. Thousands of women from the mainland come to Hong Kong to give birth because it entitles their babies to permanent residency there. The benefits include a free education and subsidised health care as part of Hong Kong's British-inspired welfare policies. Hong Kong residents pay as little as $12.80 to give birth at a hospital because of extensive government subsidies.\n\nTo limit mainland mothers coming to give birth, starting 1 February 2007, pregnant women from the mainland have to pay $5,000 for their hospital care before they are even allowed to enter Hong Kong. Under the new release rules, immigration officers will be instructed to turn back any mainlander who appears to be at least seven months pregnant and has not paid.\n\n\n\n"}

It is alongside Nicaragua's southern Caribbean coast,which is part of a region known as the Mosquito Coast. \"Mosquito\" is the nickname that is given to the region and earlier residents by early Europeans who visited and settled at this location. The name Miskito is currently being used to designate this group of people and the language that they speak.\n\nThe major population of speakers are centered in the port town of Bluefields and in a number of small villages along the north and south of the Nicaraguan southern Caribbean coast. The environment is that of a tropical rainforest with an average rainfall of 448 centimeters and temperatures that range 26.4 °C ( 79 °F ) and up. Most of the creole speakers are located along the banks of the large rivers and lagoons that surround the area. A smaller portion of the population stays in large towns along the northern Caribbean coast of Nicaragua and some also reside in Managua as well as other Central American countries.\n\nThe modern day Creole's ancestors came as slaves to the Nicaraguan caribbean cost from Africa between the 17th century and the late 18th century. They were originally brought there by the British to serve them in agriculture and the various labors. Over the period of time while they were here, the African population renewed and transformed their culture and traits by taking elements of their African culture and mixing it with their European masters along with the local Indians tribes which created a new culture. In the year of 1787, the British were forced to leave the mosquito coast due to a treaty that was put forth. Slaves who ran away or who were abandoned had made their own African communities at Bluefield. Many escaped slaves from other islands had also come over to this area to settle down. Great Britain signed the Treaty of Managua which gave a portion of an area to the natives there and allowed it to be self-governed. This allowed for the African communities to grow and flourish. Their culture became solid after gaining economic, political and social control over the Mosquito Coast. The people in the communities then began to start calling themselves Creoles.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the coast was becoming more integrated economically and socially. The Creole people have now become a minority in the areas which they had previously been predominant in. Many Creoles now mostly speak Spanish as well as creole and consider themselves to be only Nicaraguan. There are many Creoles who have now intermarried with Mestizos even though many of them still protest on how they lost their political and economic power to them.\n\nThe Creoles of Nicaragua are said to be an Afro-Caribbean population that are mixed with Europeans, Africans and Amerindians. Their culture is influenced by West African and British roots along with mestizos and miskito. Some food that is used in their cooking consists of coconut oil, taro root, manioc and other elements such as wheat flour and other processed foods. They have their own musical style which can be compared to West Indian calypso.\n\nThe Nicaraguan Creole English language is spoken as a primary first language by only 35,000 to 50,000 Creoles, Nicaraguan Garifuna, and some Miskitos. The language is being quickly replaced with Spanish with fewer and fewer people speaking it. \"Creole English is used to an increasing degree in the churches (Decker & Keener 1998) and in bilingual education programs...virtually all reading is done in Spanish\" (Bartens 2013:116).\n\n"}

Njerep is essentially extinct, with a handful who cannot speak it fully. Though word lists and grammatical information have been collected from these people, the information remains fragmented.\n\nNjerep is considered a critically endangered language under the UNESCO language endangerment index. Research conducted in 2000 indicates that only four speakers of this language remain, all of whom reside in the Somié village located along the Nigeria-Cameroon border (6°28' N, 11° 27' E). Of these six speakers, only one remains conversant in the language. The others have been reported to be semi-speakers. The youngest of the speakers was born in the 1940s, and it appears unlikely that Njerep will survive past the current generation. Njerep is no longer a language of casual conversation. Instead, it is most often used for maintaining secrecy in conversation. According to a study in 2007, only 4 people spoke this language. All of them were elderly.\n\nThough the Njerep people currently reside in Somié village, it is widely understood that the Njerep immigrated to that location. Geographically, Somié village is located on the Tikar Plain of Cameroon. The approximately 2,500 inhabitants of Somié are not only Njerep, but also a wide variety of immigrant groups including the Liap, Ndeba, and Mvop people. Though oral accounts of how these groups immigrated to the Tikar plain are often contradictory, it appears that three or four waves of immigration led to the population of this area. It is likely that the Njerep people immigrated to the Tikar Plain from some region of the Adamawa Plateau, possibly from the Djeni Mountain (also shown as Aigue Mboundo on some maps).\n\nNjerep appears to be related to the extinct Kasabe, the extinct Yeni, and the endangered Twendi. Njerep appears to have been mutually intelligible with Kasabe, though not with Twendi.\n\nNjerep falls under the broad classification of one of the Mambiloid languages. Mambila, the largest language in the Mambiloid grouping, has approximately twenty different dialects, loosely divided into East Mambila and West Mambila dialect clusters. Linguistic analysis suggests that Njerep may fall under the East Mambila cluster. However, it remains contested whether or not Njerep and its related languages should comprise its own unique grouping. \nIntense efforts to record and characterize Njerep began in 2000. However, by the year 2000, Njerep had already been in terminal decline for some time. Thus, knowledge of Njerep vocabularies and grammars remains quite fragmentary. Unfortunately, the lack of fluent speakers makes it unlikely that the incomplete record will ever be significantly amended.\n\nA comprehensive guide to Njerep vocabulary and grammar has been published and is freely available.\n\n"}

{"id": "37464286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37464286", "title": "Peter Abelard", "text": "Peter Abelard\n\nPeter Abelard (; or \"Abailardus\"; , ; 1079 – 21 April 1142) was a medieval French scholastic philosopher, theologian, and preeminent logician. His love for, and affair with, Héloïse d'Argenteuil has become legendary. The \"Chambers Biographical Dictionary\" describes him as \"the keenest thinker and boldest theologian of the 12th Century\".\n\nAbelard, originally called \"Pierre le Pallet\", was born in Le Pallet, about 10 miles (16 km) east of Nantes, in Brittany, the eldest son of a minor noble French family. As a boy, he learned quickly. His father, a knight called Berenger, encouraged Pierre to study the liberal arts, wherein he excelled at the art of dialectic (a branch of philosophy), which, at that time, consisted chiefly of the logic of Aristotle transmitted through Latin channels. Instead of entering a military career, as his father had done, Abelard became an academic. During his early academic pursuits, Abelard wandered throughout France, debating and learning, so as (in his own words) \"he became such a one as the Peripatetics.\" He first studied in the Loire area, where the nominalist Roscellinus of Compiègne, who had been accused of heresy by Anselm, was his teacher during this period.\n\nAround 1100, Abelard's travels finally brought him to Paris. In the great cathedral school of Notre-Dame de Paris (before the current cathedral was actually built), he was taught for a while by William of Champeaux, the disciple of Anselm of Laon (not to be confused with Saint Anselm), a leading proponent of Realism. During this time he changed his surname to \"Abelard\", sometimes written \"Abailard\" or \"Abaelardus\". Retrospectively, Abelard portrays William as having turned from approval to hostility when Abelard proved soon able to defeat the master in argument; Abelard was, however, closer to William's thought than this account suggests. And William thought Abelard was too arrogant. It was during this time that Abelard would provoke quarrels with both William and Roscellinus. Against opposition from the metropolitan teacher, Abelard set up his own school, first at Melun, a favoured royal residence, then, around 1102-4, for more direct competition, he moved to Corbeil, nearer Paris.\n\nHis teaching was notably successful, though for a time he had to give it up and spend time in Brittany, the strain proving too great for his constitution. On his return, after 1108, he found William lecturing at the hermitage of Saint-Victor, just outside the Île de la Cité, and there they once again became rivals, with Abelard challenging William over his theory of universals. Abelard was once more victorious, and Abelard was almost able to hold the position of master at Notre Dame. For a short time, however, William was able to prevent Abelard from lecturing in Paris. Abelard accordingly was forced to resume his school at Melun, which he was then able to move, from , to Paris itself, on the heights of Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, overlooking Notre-Dame.\n\nFrom his success in dialectic, he next turned to theology and in 1113 moved to Laon to attend the lectures of Anselm on Biblical exegesis and Christian doctrine. Unimpressed by Anselm's teaching, Abelard began to offer his own lectures on the book of Ezekiel. Anselm forbade him to continue this teaching, and Abelard returned to Paris where, in around 1115, he became master of Notre Dame and a canon of Sens (the cathedral of the archdiocese to which Paris belonged).\n\nDistinguished in figure and manners, Abelard was seen surrounded by crowds – it is said thousands of students – drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, as he says, to think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he had always lived a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, at the height of his fame, he encountered romance.\n\nHéloïse d'Argenteuil lived within the precincts of Notre-Dame, under the care of her uncle, the secular canon Fulbert. She was remarkable for her knowledge of classical letters, which extended beyond Latin to Greek and Hebrew. Abelard sought a place in Fulbert's house and, in 1115 or 1116, began an affair with Héloïse. The affair interfered with his career, and Abelard himself boasted of his conquest. Once Fulbert found out, he separated them, but they continued to meet in secret. Héloïse became pregnant and was sent by Abelard to be looked after by his family in Brittany, where she gave birth to a son whom she named Astrolabe after the scientific instrument.\n\nTo appease Fulbert, Abelard proposed a secret marriage so as not to mar his career prospects. Héloïse initially opposed it, but the couple were married. When Fulbert publicly disclosed the marriage, and Héloïse denied it, Abelard sent Héloïse to the convent at Argenteuil, where she had been brought up, in order to protect her from her uncle. Héloïse dressed as a nun and shared the nun's life, though she was not veiled.\n\nFulbert, most probably believing that Abelard wanted to be rid of Héloïse by forcing her to become a nun, arranged for a band of men to break into Abelard's room one night and castrate him. Roscellinus would later belittle Abelard for getting castrated. Later, Abelard decided to become a monk at the monastery of St Denis, near Paris. Before doing so he insisted that Héloïse take vows as a nun. Héloïse sent letters to Abelard, questioning why she must submit to a religious life for which she had no calling.\n\nIn the Abbey of Saint-Denis, the 40-year-old Abelard sought to bury himself as a monk with his woes out of sight. Finding no respite in the cloister, and having gradually turned again to study, he gave in to urgent entreaties, and reopened his school at an unknown priory owned by the monastery. His lectures, now framed in a devotional spirit, and with lectures on theology as well as his previous lectures on logic, were once again heard by crowds of students, and his old influence seemed to have returned. Using his studies of the Bible and — in his view — inconsistent writings of the leaders of the church as his basis, he wrote \"Sic et Non\" (\"Yes and No\").\n\nNo sooner had he published his theological lectures (the \"Theologia Summi Boni\") than his adversaries picked up on his rationalistic interpretation of the Trinitarian dogma. Two pupils of Anselm of Laon, Alberic of Rheims and Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Abelard, charging him with the heresy of Sabellius in a provincial synod held at Soissons in 1121. They obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching, and Abelard was made to burn the \"Theologia\" himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own, but it seems to have been agreed in advance that this sentence would be revoked almost immediately, because after a few days in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons, Abelard returned to St. Denis.\n\nLife in his own monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard himself was partly responsible. He took a sort of malicious pleasure in irritating the monks. As if for the sake of a joke, he cited Bede to prove that the believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite had been Bishop of Corinth, while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard wrote a letter to the Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of Eusebius of Caesarea's \"Historia Ecclesiastica\" and St. Jerome, according to whom Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.\n\nAbelard initially lodged at St Ayoul of Provins, where the prior was a friend. Then, after the death of Abbot Adam in March 1122, Abelard was able to gain permission from the new abbot, Suger, to live \"in whatever solitary place he wished\". In a deserted place near Nogent-sur-Seine in Champagne, he built a cabin of stubble and reeds, and a simple oratory dedicated to the Trinity and became a hermit. When his retreat became known, students flocked from Paris, and covered the wilderness around him with their tents and huts. He began to teach again there. The oratory was rebuilt in wood and stone and rededicated as the Oratory of the Paraclete.\nAbelard remained at the Paraclete for about five years. His combination of the teaching of secular arts with his profession as a monk was heavily criticized by other men of religion, and Abelard contemplated flight outside Christendom altogether. Abelard therefore decided to leave and find another refuge, accepting sometime between 1126 and 1128 an invitation to preside over the Abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys on the far-off shore of Lower Brittany. The region was inhospitable, the domain a prey to outlaws, the house itself savage and disorderly. There, too, his relations with the community deteriorated.\n\nDuring this time, however, Abelard came back into contact with Héloïse. In April 1129, Abbot Suger of St Denis succeeded in his plans to have the nuns, including Héloïse, expelled from the convent at Argenteuil, in order to take over the property for St Denis. Héloïse had meanwhile become the head of a new foundation of nuns called the Paraclete. Abelard became the abbot of the new community and provided it with a rule and with a justification of the nun’s way of life; in this he emphasized the virtue of literary study. He also provided books of hymns he had composed, and in the early 1130s he and Héloïse composed a collection of their own love letters and religious correspondence.\nLack of success at St Gildas made Abelard decide to take up public teaching again (although he remained for a few more years, officially, Abbot of St Gildas). It is not entirely certain what he then did, but given that John of Salisbury heard Abelard lecture on dialectic in 1136, it is presumed that he returned to Paris and resumed teaching on the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. It is presumed his lectures included logic, at least until 1136, but were mainly concerned with the Bible, Christian doctrine, and ethics. Then he produced further drafts of his \"Theologia\" in which he analyzed the sources of belief in the Trinity and praised the pagan philosophers of classical antiquity for their virtues and for their discovery by the use of reason of many fundamental aspects of Christian revelation.\n\nAt some point in this time Abelard wrote, among other things, his famous \"Historia Calamitatum\". This moved Héloïse to write her first Letter; the first being followed by the two other Letters, in which she finally accepted the part of resignation, which, now as a brother to a sister, Abelard commended to her. Sometime before 1140, Abelard published his masterpiece, \"Ethica\" or \"Scito te ipsum\" (Know Thyself), where he analyzes the idea of sin and that actions are not what a man will be judged for but intentions. During this period, he also wrote \"Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum et Christianum\" (Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian), and also \"Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos\", a commentary on St. Paul's epistle to the Romans, where he expands on the meaning of Christ's life.\n\nAbelard was to face, however, another challenge which would put a final end to his teaching career. After 1136, it is not clear whether Abelard had stopped teaching, or whether he perhaps continued with all except his lectures on logic until as late as 1141. Whatever the exact timing, a process was instigated by William of St Thierry, who discovered what he considered to be heresies in some of Abelard's teaching. In spring 1140 he wrote to the Bishop of Chartres and to Bernard of Clairvaux denouncing them. Another, less distinguished, theologian, Thomas of Morigny, also produced at the same time a list of Abelard's supposed heresies, perhaps at Bernard's instigation. Bernard's complaint mainly is that Abelard has applied logic where it is not applicable, and that is illogical. Amid pressure from Bernard, Abelard challenged Bernard either to withdraw his accusations, or to make them publicly at the important church council at Sens planned for 2 June 1141. In so doing, Abelard put himself into the position of the wronged party and forced Bernard to defend himself from the accusation of slander. Bernard avoided this trap, however: on the eve of the council, he called a private meeting of the assembled bishops and persuaded them to condemn, one by one, each of the heretical propositions he attributed to Abelard. When Abelard appeared at the council the next day, he was presented with a list of condemned propositions imputed to him.\n\nRefusing to answer to these propositions, Abelard left the assembly, appealed to the Pope, and set off for Rome, hoping that the Pope would be more supportive. However, this hope was unfounded. On 16 July 1141, Pope Innocent II issued a bull excommunicating Abelard and his followers and imposing perpetual silence on him, and in a second document he ordered Abelard to be confined in a monastery and his books to be burned. Abelard was saved from this sentence, however, by Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny. Abelard had stopped there, on his way to Rome, before the papal condemnation had reached France. Peter persuaded Abelard, already old, to give up his journey and stay at the monastery. Peter managed to arrange a reconciliation with Bernard, to have the sentence of excommunication lifted, and to persuade Innocent that it was enough if Abelard remained under the aegis of Cluny. Abelard was treated not as a condemned heretic, but as a revered and wise scholar. He spent his final months at the priory of St. Marcel, near Chalon-sur-Saône, before he died on 21 April 1142. He is said to have uttered the last words \"I don't know\", before expiring. He died from a combination of fever and a skin disorder, most likely scurvy.\n\nAbelard was first buried at St. Marcel, but his remains were soon carried off secretly to the Paraclete, and given over to the loving care of Héloïse, who in time came herself to rest beside them in 1163.\n\nThe bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the French Revolution, and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in Père Lachaise Cemetery in eastern Paris. The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.\n\nThis remains, however, disputed. The Oratory of the Paraclete claims Abelard and Héloïse are buried there and that what exists in Père-Lachaise is merely a monument, or cenotaph. According to Père-Lachaise, the remains of both lovers were transferred from the Oratory in the early 19th century and reburied in the famous crypt on their grounds. Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at Père-Lachaise, Heloïse's remains are elsewhere.\n\nThe general importance of Abelard lies in his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner of philosophizing, with the object of giving a formal, rational expression to received ecclesiastical doctrine. Though his particular interpretations may have been condemned, they were conceived in essentially the same spirit as the general scheme of thought afterwards elaborated in the 13th century with approval from the heads of the Church.\n\nHe helped to establish the ascendancy of the philosophical authority of Aristotle which became firmly established in the half-century after his death. It was at this time that the completed \"Organon\", and gradually all the other works of the Greek thinker, first came to be available in the schools. Before his time, Plato's authority was the basis for the prevailing Realism. As regards his so-called Conceptualism and his attitude to the question of universals, see .\n\nOutside of his dialectic, it was in ethics that Abelard showed greatest activity of philosophical thought. He stressed the subjective intention as determining, if not the moral character, at least the moral value, of human action. His thought in this direction, anticipating something of modern speculation, is remarkable because his scholastic successors accomplished least in the field of morals, hardly venturing to bring the principles and rules of conduct under pure philosophical discussion, even after they were made fully aware of Aristotle's great ethical inquiries.\n\nRegarding unbaptized who die in infancy, Abelard—in \"Commentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos\"—emphasized the goodness of God and interpreted St. Augustine of Hippo's \"mildest punishment\" as the pain of loss at being denied the beatific vision (\"carentia visionis Dei\"), without hope of obtaining it, but with no additional punishments. His thought contributed to the forming of Limbo of Infants theory in the 12th–13th centuries.\n\n\nAbelard was an enormous influence on his contemporaries and the course of medieval philosophical thought, but he has been known in modern times mainly for his connection with Héloïse. Only one of his strictly philosophical works, the ethical treatise \"Scito te ipsum\", had been published before the 19th century, in 1721. It was only with the publication by Cousin in 1836 of the collection entitled \"Ouvrages inedits d'Abelard\" that Abelard's philosophical work began to be studied more closely. Cousin's collection gave extracts from the theological work \"Sic et Non\" (\"Yes and No\") which is an assemblage of what Abelard saw as opposite opinions on doctrinal points culled from the Fathers as a basis for discussion. The collection also includes the \"Dialectica, \"and commentaries on logical works of Aristotle, Porphyry and Boethius. Two works published by Cousin and believed at the time to be by Abelard, the fragment \"De Generibus et Speciebus \"(published in the 1836 collection), and also the psychological treatise \"De Intellectibus\" (published separately by Cousin in \"Fragmens Philosophiques\", vol. ii.), are\" \"now believed on upon internal evidence not to be by Abelard himself, but only to have sprung out of his school\".\" A genuine work, the \"Glossulae super Porphyrium\", from which Charles de Rémusat gave extracts in his monograph \"Abelard\" (1845), was published in 1930. The fascinating hypothesis of Abaelard‘s influence on Menasseh Ben Israel and Spinoza has been developed by Robert Menasse and first published in his essay „Enlightement as Harmonious Strategy“ edited by \"Versopolis\" in 2018.\n\nDuring his general audience on 4 November 2009, Pope Benedict XVI talked about Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and Peter Abelard to illustrate differences in the monastic and scholastic approaches to theology in the 12th century. The Pope recalled that theology is the search for a rational understanding (if possible) of the mysteries of Christian revelation, which is believed through faith — faith that seeks intelligibility (\"fides quaerens intellectum\"). But St. Bernard, a representative of monastic theology, emphasized \"faith\" whereas Abelard, who is a scholastic, stressed \"understanding through reason\".\n\nFor Bernard, faith is based on the testimony of Scripture and on the teaching of the Fathers of the Church. Thus, Bernard found it difficult to agree with Abelard and, in a more general way, with those who would subject the truths of faith to the critical examination of reason — an examination which, in his opinion, posed a grave danger: intellectualism, the relativizing of truth, and the questioning of the truths of faith themselves. Theology for Bernard could be nourished only in contemplative prayer, by the affective union of the heart and mind with God, with only one purpose: to promote the living, intimate experience of God; an aid to loving God ever more and ever better.\n\nAccording to Pope Benedict XVI, an excessive use of philosophy rendered Abelard’s doctrine of the Trinity dangerously fragile and, thus, his idea of God. In the field of morals, his teaching was vague, as he insisted on considering the intention of the subject as the only basis for describing the goodness or evil of moral acts, thereby ignoring the objective meaning and moral value of the acts, resulting in a dangerous subjectivism. But the Pope recognized the great achievements of Abelard, who made a decisive contribution to the development of scholastic theology, which eventually expressed itself in a more mature and fruitful way during the following century. And some of Abelard's insights should not be underestimated, for example, his affirmation that non-Christian religious traditions already contain some form of preparation for welcoming Christ.\n\nPope Benedict XVI concluded that Bernard’s \"theology of the heart\" and Abelard’s \"theology of reason\" represent the importance of healthy theological discussion, especially when the questions being debated have not been defined by the magisterium, and humble obedience to the authority of the Church. St. Bernard, and even Abelard himself, always recognized without any hesitation the authority of the magisterium. Abelard showed humility in acknowledging his errors, and Bernard exercised great benevolence. The Pope emphasized, in the field of theology, there should be a balance between architectonic principles, which are given through Revelation and which always maintain their primary importance, and the interpretative principles proposed by philosophy (that is, by reason), which have an important function, but only as a tool. When the balance breaks down, theological reflection runs the risk of becoming marred by error; it is then up to the magisterium to exercise the needed service to truth, for which it is responsible.\n\nThe story of Abelard and Héloïse has proved immensely popular in modern European culture. This story is known almost entirely from a few sources: first, the \"Historia Calamitatum; \"secondly, the seven letters between Abelard and Héloïse which survive (three written by Abelard, and four by Héloïse), and always follow the \"Historia Calamitatum\" in the manuscript tradition; thirdly, four letters between Peter the Venerable and Héloïse (three by Peter, one by Héloïse). They are, in modern times, the best known and most widely translated parts of Abelard's work.\n\nIt is unclear quite how the letters of Abelard and Héloïse came to be preserved. There are brief and factual references to their relationship by 12th-century writers including William Godel and Walter Map. It seems unlikely, however, that the letters were widely known in this period. Rather, the earliest manuscripts of the letters are dated to the late 13th century. It therefore seems likely that the letters sent between Abelard and Héloïse were kept by Héloïse at the Paraclete along with the 'Letters of Direction', and that more than a century after her death they were brought to Paris and copied. At this time, the story of their love affair was summarised by Jean de Meun in his continuation to \"Le Roman de la Rose\".\n\nTheir story does not appear to have been widely known in the later Middle Ages, either. There is no mention of the couple in Dante; Chaucer makes a very brief reference in the Wife of Bath's Prologue (lines 677–8), but no more. One of the first people to show a deeper interest in the couple appears to have been Petrarch, who owned an early 14th-century manuscript of the couple's letters. This silence on what is today seen as a particularly touching story is perhaps surprising, given the Renaissance ideal of courtly love – but it is possible that the story of Abelard and Héloïse could not be appropriately fitted into the ideals of the lover's devotion to the chaste and unattainable lady.\n\nThe first publication of the letters, in Latin, was in Paris in 1616, simultaneously in two editions. These editions gave rise to numerous translations of the letters into European languages – and consequent 18th- and 19th-century interest in the story of the medieval lovers. In the 18th century, the couple were revered as tragic lovers, who endured adversity in life but were united in death. With this reputation, they were the only individuals from the pre-Revolutionary period whose remains were given a place of honour at the newly founded cemetery of Père Lachaise in Paris. At this time, they were effectively revered as romantic saints; for some, they were forerunners of modernity, at odds with the ecclesiastical and monastic structures of their day and to be celebrated more for rejecting the traditions of the past than for any particular intellectual achievement.\n\nThe \"Historia\" was first published in 1841 by John Caspar Orelli of Turici. Then, in 1849, Victor Cousin published \"Petri Abaelardi opera\", in part based on the two Paris editions of 1616 but also based on the reading of four manuscripts; this became the standard edition of the letters. Soon after, in 1855, Migne printed an expanded version of the 1616 edition under the title \"Opera Petri Abaelardi\", without the name of Héloïse on the title page.\n\nCritical editions of the \"Historia Calamitatum\" and the letters were subsequently published in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAt various times in the past two hundred years, it has been suggested that not all the letters are genuine. Questions were first raised in 1806 by Ignaz Fessler, and were renewed by J. C. Orelli in 1844 and Ludovic Lalanne in 1855, who all suggested that the letters might simply be a literary fiction. Doubts were raised at intervals in the succeeding decades. More recently, John Benton hypothesised (in 1972) that the entire letter collection might have been forged in the late 13th century, or by Abelard himself (a position Benton had reverted to by 1979). In the aftermath of reaction to Benton's thought, though, scholars have become more confident in asserting the genuine nature of the letters.\n\nAccording to historian Constant Mews, \"The Lost Love Letters of Héloïse and Abelard\", 113 anonymous love letters found in a 15th-century manuscript represent the correspondence exchanged by Héloïse and Abelard during the earlier phase of their affair. These are not to be confused with the accepted \"Letters of Abelard and Héloïse\" which were written nearly fifteen years after their romance ended.\n\nAbelard was also long known as an important poet and composer. He composed some celebrated love songs for Héloïse that are now lost, and which have not been identified in the anonymous repertoire. Héloïse praised these songs in a letter: \"The great charm and sweetness in language and music, and a soft attractiveness of the melody obliged even the unlettered\".\n\nAbelard composed a hymnbook for the religious community that Héloïse joined. This hymnbook, written after 1130, differed from contemporary hymnals, such as that of Bernard of Clairvaux, in that Abelard used completely new and homogeneous material. The songs were grouped by metre, which meant that comparatively few melodies could be used. Only one melody from this hymnal survives, \"O quanta qualia\".\n\nAbelard also wrote six biblical \"planctus\" (laments):\n\nIn surviving manuscripts these pieces have been notated in diastematic neumes which resist reliable transcription. Only Planctus VI was fixed in square notation. Planctus as genre influenced the subsequent development of the lai, a song form that flourished in northern Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nMelodies that have survived have been praised as \"flexible, expressive melodies [that] show an elegance and technical adroitness that are very similar to the qualities that have been long admired in Abelard's poetry.\"\n\n\n\nAttribution\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33586685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33586685", "title": "Style (sociolinguistics)", "text": "Style (sociolinguistics)\n\nIn sociolinguistics, a style is a set of linguistic variants with specific social meanings. In this context, social meanings can include group membership, personal attributes, or beliefs. Linguistic variation is at the heart of the concept of linguistic style—without variation there is no basis for distinguishing social meanings. Variation can occur syntactically, lexically, and phonologically.\n\nMany approaches to interpreting and defining style incorporate the concepts of indexicality, indexical order, stance-taking, and linguistic ideology. Note that a style is not a fixed attribute of a speaker. Rather, a speaker may use different styles depending on context. Additionally, speakers often incorporate elements of multiple styles into their speech, either consciously or subconsciously, thereby creating a new style.\n\nWilliam Labov first introduced the concept of style in the context of sociolinguistics in the 1960s, though he did not explicitly define the term. Labov primarily studied individual linguistic variables, and how they were associated with various social groups (e.g. social classes). He summed up his ideas about style in five principles:\n\nLabov’s work primarily attempted to linked linguistic variants as a function of formality (a proxy for attention to speech) to specific social groups. In his study of /r/-variation in New York Department stores, he observed that those with a lower social class are less likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in words like \"fourth\" and \"floor\", while those with a higher social class are more likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in their less careful speech. However, once forced to pay attention to language, they style-shift in a way indicative of their social aspirations. That is, those with a middle social class often alter their pronunciation of /r/ in a way that is generally indicative of a higher social standing, while those with a lower or higher social class more or less maintain their original pronunciation (presumably because they were either happy with their current position in the social hierarchy or resigned to it).\n\nPenny Eckert's characterization of style as related to indexicality marked the beginning of a new approach to linguistic style. She builds on Michael Silverstein's notion of indexical order: the notion that linguistic variables index a social group, which by association leads to the indexing of certain traits stereotypically associated with members of that group. For example, in New York in the 1960s, a study by Labov showed that the clear articulation of postvocalic [r] in words like \"fourth\" and \"floor\" indexed a higher class (in New York), whereas the absence of postvocalic [r] indexed a lower class. However, the presence of lack of postvocalic [r] can also function as a higher order indexical that points indirectly to traits stereotypically associated with members of the upper or lower class. In this way, not articulating the [r] in the word \"fourth\" could index, for example, a lack of education (the trait) in addition to a lower social class (the group). According to this theory, any linguistic variable has its own indexical field spanning any number of potential meanings; the meanings actually associated with the variable are determined by social context and the style in which the variable is being used. These indexical fields are fluid and often change depending on their usage in different contexts or in combination with other variables. This view of style revolves around variation, and interpretation of variation as a purely indexical system built from ideological connections.\n\nIn Judith Irvine's conception of style she emphasizes the fact that a style is defined only within a social framework. A variant and the social meanings it indexes are not inherently linked, rather, the social meanings exist as ideologically mediated interpretations made by members of the social framework. She highlights the fact that social meanings such as group membership mean nothing without an ideology to interpret them.\n\nMary Bucholtz's approach to style also relies heavily on ideology. She defines style as \"a unidimensional continuum between vernacular and standard that varies based on the degree of speaker self-monitoring in a given speech context\". This continuum depends on the ideology of the speaker, for they self-monitor depending on their ideologies concerning particular words. Bucholtz explains the ideology of gendered slang, in particular, the Mexican slang for \"dude\", guey. Guey indexes a stance of cool solidarity, and indirectly, [masculinity]. Ochs's framework for stance dictates that stances are ideologically connected with social groups. Bucholtz argues that ideology connects the stylistic feature of using guey with particular groups of people based on age, gender (male), and race. She also defines the concept of stylization as a set of deviations from the style one would expect from a situation according to the ideology of the style and how it matches up to the situation at hand. This leads to the indexing of groups with which the style is associated, and thus simplifies the indexical field at hand.\n\nOther theories on style often incorporate the role of stance-taking. These theories maintain that style is best viewed as consisting of smaller, more variable units known as stances. In this view, a stance is essentially a form of contextualization; it indicates the position of an interlocutor with respect to a particular utterance, conversation or other interlocutors. An interlocutor's use of language could imply, for instance, that they feel a certain way about an issue at hand, or that they do not care for the subject, or the people around them; these positions with respect to the context are different stances.\n\nAccording to stance theory, a given interlocutor uses certain variations among linguistic variables to take a stance or stances in an interaction. The set of stances interlocutors tend to repeat or use the most often in certain contexts (or in general) comprise their style. This approach focuses more on interaction and reaction in a linguistic context, rather than a static identity or social group. Linguistic variables do not index specific social groups by themselves, but instead combine with other linguistic variables to index various stances and styles, which are in turn associated with social groups. Kiesling writes:\n\nIn this model of linguistic variation, stances are an important middle step between linguistic variables and a style or characteristic social group.\n\nThe performative creation of style is the result of a desire to project a certain social image or stance. Interlocutors who wish to present in a certain manner may consciously alter their linguistic style to affect how they appear to others. An example of this performative style is exemplified by non-linguistic situations. In one study, Eckert interviewed several female students at Palo Alto High School in California. \"New-wave\" teens who wished to be distinctive adapted a more rebellious fashion style, wearing mostly dark clothes and pegged jeans, whereas popular, \"preppy\" girls tended towards light pastel colors and straight designer jeans. However, a couple girls wished to portray themselves as unique without losing their popular conformist social identity. The table below compares resulting styles:\n\nAs Eckert demonstrates, the \"preppy\" girls who wished to maintain a slightly distinctive style combined certain aspects of the \"preppy\" style with the \"new-wave\" style. They maintained their color choices and shied away from dark eye-makeup—but wore blue pegged jeans instead of the standard designer jeans of their group. This is because they perceive that the eye makeup indexes an \"adult\" or \"slutty\" characteristic, while the all-black color scheme is \"scary\".\n\nIn the same way, interlocutors often choose to performatively create their own linguistic style to suit the self-image they desire. In a case study conducted by Podesva, he studies the style of a gay lawyer, who combines certain aspects of common professional and gay linguistic features to create his own style, indexing both a \"professional lawyer\" characteristic and a unique \"gay\" characteristic with his speech.\n\nStyles are not necessarily consciously created; there are a number of processes that contribute to the construction of meaning for both individual speech variants and styles. Obviously, individual variants can be adopted by multiple styles. When a variant is newly adopted by a style, it changes both the perception of the variant and the perception of the style. In the Eckertian view, a person's linguistic style identifies their position in an indexical field of social meanings. These social meanings are created by a continual analysis and interpretation of the linguistic variants that are observed based on who uses them.\n\nStyle shifting refers to a single speaker changing style in response to context. As noted by Eckert and Rickford, in sociolinguistic literature terms style and register sometimes have been used interchangeably. Also, various connotations of style are a subject of study in stylistics.\n\nStyle-shifting is a manifestation of intraspeaker (within-speaker) variation, in contrast with interspeaker (between-speakers) variation. It is a voluntary act which an individual effects in order to respond to or initiate changes in sociolinguistic situation (e.g., interlocutor-related, setting-related, topic-related).\n\nWilliam Labov, while conducting sociolinguistic interviews, designated two types of spoken style, casual and formal, and three types of reading style (a reading passage, a word list, and a minimal pair list). Analysing style-shifting Labov postulated that \"styles can be arranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech\" (1972, as quoted in), casual style requiring the least amount of conscious self-monitoring. Such style-shifting is often referred to as responsive (produced in response to normative pressures).\n\nIn recent developments of stylistic variation analysis scholars such as Allan Bell, Barbara Johnstone, Natalie Schilling-Estes have been focusing on initiative dimension of style-shifting, which occurs when speakers proactively choose among various linguistic resources (e.g. dialectal, archaic or vernacular forms) in order to present themselves in a specific way. In initiative style-shifting speakers actively engage in social practices to construct social meaning.\n\nThere have been a large number of suggested motivations for this phenomenon:\n\nStyle matching is defined as the matching of behaviors between a speaker and an interlocutor. The premise of the theory is that individuals have the ability to strategically negotiate the social distance between themselves and their interaction partners. This can be done linguistically, paralinguistically, and non-verbally, for example, by varying speech style, rate, pitch, and gaze.\n\nOne theory behind linguistic style matching suggests that the words one speaker uses prime the listener to respond in a specific way. In this fashion, an interlocutor is influenced by her partner’s language at the word level in natural conversation in the same way that one’s non-verbal behavior can be influenced by another’s movement.\n\nAdditionally, Kate G. Niederhoffer proposes a coordination-engagement hypothesis, which suggests that the degree of engagement should be predictive of both linguistic and nonverbal coordination. There exists an interactional complexity whereby people can converge on some communicative features to meet social needs, but diverge on others for identity management. For example, one can diverge in accent but converge in lexical diversity.\n\nIndividuals in two-person interactions exhibit linguistic style matching on both the conversational level and on a turn-by-turn level. This coordinated use of language occurs at a remarkably basic level (e.g., classes of words) and appears to occur independently of the perceived quality of an interaction, the length of the interaction, whether the interaction is face-to-face or on an Internet-like chat, etc. Socially, two people appear to fall into this coordinated way of interacting almost immediately even if they have never spoken to one another before. The listener is influenced by many linguistic primes set up by the speaker. All of this occurs on an unconscious level and is sensitive to the power differential between the participants, with less dominant participants generally being more attentive to more dominant participants’ words.\n\nAn opposition between urban and suburban linguistic variables is common to all metropolitan regions of the United States. Although the particular variables distinguishing urban and suburban styles may differ from place to place, the trend is for urban styles to lead in the use of nonstandard forms and negative concord.\nIn Penny Eckert’s study of Belten High in the Detroit suburbs, she noted a stylistic difference between two groups that she identified: school-oriented jocks and urban-oriented, school-alienated burnouts. The variables she analyzed were the usage of negative concord and the mid and low vowels involved in the Northern Cities Shift, which consists of the following changes: æ > ea, a > æ, ə > a, ʌ > ə, ay > oy, and ɛ > ʌ ([y] here is equivalent to the IPA symbol [j]). All of these changes are urban-led, as is the use of negative concord.\nThe older, mostly stabilized changes, æ > ea, a > æ, and ə > a, were used the most by women, while the newer changes, ʌ > ə, ay > oy, and ɛ > ʌ were used the most by burnouts. Eckert theorizes that by using an urban variant such as [foyt], they were not associating themselves with urban youth. Rather, they were trying to index traits that were associated with urban youth, such as \"tough\" and \"street-smart\".\n\nThis theory is further supported by evidence from a subgroup within the burnout girls, which Eckert refers to as ‘burned-out’ burnout girls. She characterizes this group as being even more anti-establishment than the ‘regular’ burnout girls. This subgroup led overall in the use of negative concord as well as in female-led changes. This is unusual because negative concord is generally used the most by males. ‘Burned-out’ burnout girls were not indexing masculinity — this is shown by their use of female-led variants and the fact that they were found to express femininity in non-linguistic ways. This shows that linguistic variables may have different meanings in the context of different styles.\n\nThere is some debate about what makes a style \"gay.\" In stereotypically flamboyant gay speech, the phonemes /s/ and /l/ have a greater duration. People are also more likely to identify those with higher frequency ranges as gay.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many different styles represented within the gay community. There is much linguistic variation in the gay community, and each subculture appears to have its own distinct features. According to Podesva et al., \"gay culture encompasses reified categories such as leather daddies, clones, drag queens, circuit boys, guppies (gay yuppies), gay prostitutes, and activists both mainstream and radical, as well as more local communities of practice which may not even have names.\" Thus, each of these sub-cultures speaks with a different style than all the other sub-cultures.\n\nThere are also many features that are fairly prevalent in all of society but can index homosexuality in particular contexts. \"Cooperative discourse\" is often considered a feature of gay linguistic style, but is also used by some straight men, as well as by women. This is in line with an approach to style that emphasizes stance.\n\nPodesva et al. performed a study describing a sub-style within gay culture that some gay activists, lawyers, or other professionals use. The gay lawyer in their study does not want to appear \"too gay,\" lest he also convey frivolity or other characteristics that he deemed unprofessional. It was important to him that he appear rational, educated, and competent as a lawyer. This is in line with the audience approach to style in which styles receive their meaning as a result of their opposition to other styles in their social sphere (in this case other gay styles). The lawyer's high release of word final stops, a variable also often found in the language of geek-girls and Orthodox Jews, indexes a desire to appear educated and not \"too gay.\" This actually indexes his gay identity because he is tailoring his gay style (or lack thereof).\n\n"}

{"id": "31715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31715", "title": "Uralic languages", "text": "Uralic languages\n\nThe Uralic languages (; sometimes called Uralian languages ) form a language family of 38 languages spoken by approximately 25million people, predominantly in Northern Eurasia. The Uralic languages with the most native speakers are Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian, which are official languages in Hungary, Finland, and Estonia, respectively, and in the European Union. Other Uralic languages with significant numbers of speakers are Erzya, Moksha, Mari, Udmurt, and Komi, which are officially recognized languages in various regions of Russia.\n\nThe name \"Uralic\" derives from the fact that the areas where the languages are spoken are found on both sides of the Ural Mountains. Also, the original homeland (Urheimat) is commonly hypothesized to be in the vicinity of the Urals.\n\nFinno-Ugric is sometimes used as a synonym for Uralic, though Finno-Ugric is widely understood to exclude the Samoyedic languages. Scholars who do not accept the traditional notion that Samoyedic split first from the rest of the Uralic family may treat the terms as synonymous.\n\nIn recent times, linguists often place the Urheimat (original homeland) of the Proto-Uralic language in the vicinity of the Volga River, west of the Urals, close to the Urheimat of the Indo-European languages, or to the east and southeast of the Urals. Historian Gyula László places its origin in the forest zone between the Oka River and central Poland. E. N. Setälä and M. Zsirai place it between the Volga and Kama Rivers. According to E. Itkonen, the ancestral area extended to the Baltic Sea. P. Hajdu has suggested a homeland in western and northwestern Siberia.\n\nThe first plausible mention of a Uralic people is in Tacitus's \"Germania\" (c. 98 AD), mentioning the \"Fenni\" (usually interpreted as referring to the Sami) and two other possibly Uralic tribes living in the farthest reaches of Scandinavia. There are many possible earlier mentions, including the Iyrcae (perhaps related to Yugra) described by Herodotus living in what is now European Russia, and the Budini, described by Herodotus as notably red-haired (a characteristic feature of the Udmurts) and living in northeast Ukraine and/or adjacent parts of Russia. In the late 15th century, European scholars noted the resemblance of the names \"Hungaria\" and \"Yugria\", the names of settlements east of the Ural. They assumed a connection but did not seek linguistic evidence.\n\nThe affinity of Hungarian and Finnish was first proposed in the late 17th century. Three candidates can be credited for the discovery: the German scholar Martin Vogel, the Swedish scholar Georg Stiernhielm and the Swedish courtier Bengt Skytte. Vogel's unpublished study of the relationship, commissioned by Cosimo III of Tuscany, was clearly the most modern of these: he established several grammatical and lexical parallels between Finnish and Hungarian as well as Sami. Stiernhelm commented on the similarities of Sami, Estonian and Finnish, and also on a few similar words between Finnish and Hungarian. These authors were the first to outline what was to become the classification of the Finno-Ugric, and later Uralic family. This proposal received some of its initial impetus from the fact that these languages, unlike most of the other languages spoken in Europe, are not part of what is now known as the Indo-European family. In 1717, Swedish professor Olof Rudbeck proposed about 100 etymologies connecting Finnish and Hungarian, of which about 40 are still considered valid. Several early reports comparing Finnish or Hungarian with Mordvin, Mari or Khanty were additionally collected by Leibniz and edited by his assistant Johann Georg von Eckhart.\n\nIn 1730, Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published his book (\"The North and East Parts of Europe and Asia\"), surveying the geography, peoples and languages of Russia. All the main groups of the Uralic languages were already identified here. Nonetheless, these relationships were not widely accepted. Hungarian intellectuals especially were not interested in the theory and preferred to assume connections with Turkic tribes, an attitude characterized by Merritt Ruhlen as due to \"the wild unfettered Romanticism of the epoch\". Still, in spite of this hostile climate, the Hungarian Jesuit János Sajnovics travelled with Maximilian Hell to survey the alleged relationship between Hungarian and Sami. Sajnovics published his results in 1770, arguing for a relationship based on several grammatical features. In 1799, the Hungarian Sámuel Gyarmathi published the most complete work on Finno-Ugric to that date.\n\nUp to the beginning of the 19th century, knowledge on the Uralic languages spoken in Russia had remained restricted to scanty observations by travelers. Already Finnish historian Henrik Gabriel Porthan had stressed that further progress would require dedicated field missions. One of the first of these was undertaken by Anders Johan Sjögren, who brought the Vepsians to general knowledge and elucidated in detail the relatedness of Finnish and Komi. Still more extensive were the field research expeditions made in the 1840s by Matthias Castrén (1813–1852) and Antal Reguly (1819–1858), who focused especially on the Samoyedic and the Ob-Ugric languages, respectively. Reguly's materials were worked on by the Hungarian linguist Pál Hunfalvy (1810–1891) and German Josef Budenz (1836–1892), who both supported the Uralic affinity of Hungarian. Budenz was the first scholar to bring this result to popular consciousness in Hungary, and to attempt a reconstruction of the Proto-Finno-Ugric grammar and lexicon. Another late-19th-century Hungarian contribution is that of Ignácz Halász (1855–1901), who published extensive comparative material of Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic in the 1890s, and whose work is at the base of today's wide acceptance of the inclusion of Samoyedic as a part of Uralic. Meanwhile, in the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, a chair for Finnish language and linguistics at the University of Helsinki was created in 1850, first held by Castrén.\n\nIn 1883, the Finno-Ugrian Society was founded in Helsinki on the proposal of Otto Donner, which would lead to Helsinki overtaking St. Petersburg as the chief northern center of research of the Uralic languages. During the late 19th and early 20th century (until the separation of Finland from Russia following the Russian revolution), a large number of stipendiates were sent by the Society to survey the still less known Uralic languages. Major researchers of this period included Heikki Paasonen (studying especially the Mordvinic languages), Yrjö Wichmann (studying Permic), Artturi Kannisto (Mansi), Kustaa Fredrik Karjalainen (Khanty), Toivo Lehtisalo (Nenets), and Kai Donner (Kamass). The vast amounts of data collected on these expeditions would provide edition work for later generations of Finnish Uralicists for more than a century.\n\nThe Uralic family comprises nine undisputed groups with no consensus classification between them. (Some of the proposals are listed in the next section.) An agnostic approach treats them as separate branches.\n\nObsolete or native names are displayed in italics.\n\nThere is also historical evidence of a number of extinct languages of uncertain affiliation:\n\nTraces of Finno-Ugric substrata, especially in toponymy, in the northern part of European Russia have been proposed as evidence for even more extinct Uralic languages.\n\nAll Uralic languages are thought to have descended, through independent processes of language change, from Proto-Uralic. The internal structure of the Uralic family has been debated since the family was first proposed. Doubts about the validity of most of the proposed higher-order branchings (grouping the nine undisputed families) are becoming more common.\n\nA traditional classification of the Uralic languages has existed since the late 19th century. It has enjoyed frequent adaptation in whole or in part in encyclopedias, handbooks, and overviews of the Uralic family. Donner's model is as follows:\n\n\nAt Donner's time, the Samoyedic languages were still poorly known, and he was not able to address their position. As they became better known in the early 20th century, they were found to be quite divergent, and they were assumed to have separated already early on. The terminology adopted for this was \"Uralic\" for the entire family, \"Finno-Ugric\" for the non-Samoyedic languages (though \"Finno-Ugric\" has, to this day, remained in use also as a synonym for the whole family). Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic are listed in ISO 639-5 as primary branches of Uralic.\n\nNodes of the traditional family tree recognized in some overview sources:\n\nLittle explicit evidence has however been presented in favour of Donner's model since his original proposal, and numerous alternate schemes have been proposed. Especially in Finland, there has been a growing tendency to reject the Finno-Ugric intermediate protolanguage. A recent competing proposal instead unites Ugric and Samoyedic in an \"East Uralic\" group for which shared innovations can be noted.\n\nThe Finno-Permic grouping still holds some support, though the arrangement of its subgroups is a matter of some dispute. Mordvinic is commonly seen as particularly closely related to or part of Finno-Samic. The term \"Volgaic\" (or \"Volga-Finnic\") was used to denote a branch previously believed to include Mari, Mordvinic and a number of the extinct languages, but it is now obsolete and considered a geographic classification rather than a linguistic one.\n\nWithin Ugric, uniting Mansi with Hungarian rather than Khanty has been a competing hypothesis to Ob-Ugric.\n\nLexicostatistics has been used in defense of the traditional family tree. A recent re-evaluation of the evidence however fails to find support for Finno-Ugric and Ugric, suggesting four lexically distinct branches (Finno-Permic, Hungarian, Ob-Ugric and Samoyedic).\n\nOne alternate proposal for a family tree, with emphasis on the development of numerals, is as follows:\n\nAnother proposed tree, more divergent from the standard, focusing on consonant isoglosses (which does not consider the position of the Samoyedic languages) is presented by Viitso (1997), and refined in Viitso (2000):\nThe grouping of the four bottom-level branches remains to some degree open to interpretation, with competing models of Finno-Saamic vs. Eastern Finno-Ugric (Mari, Mordvinic, Permic-Ugric; *k > ɣ between vowels, degemination of stops) and Finno-Volgaic (Finno-Saamic, Mari, Mordvinic; *δʲ > *ð between vowels) vs. Permic-Ugric. Viitso finds no evidence for a Finno-Permic grouping.\n\nExtending this approach to cover the Samoyedic languages suggests affinity with Ugric, resulting in the aforementioned East Uralic grouping, as it also shares the same sibilant developments. A further non-trivial Ugric-Samoyedic isogloss is the reduction *k, *x, *w > ɣ when before *i, and after a vowel (cf. *k > ɣ above), or adjacent to *t, *s, *š, or *ś.\n\nFinno-Ugric consonant developments after Viitso (2000); Samoyedic changes after Sammallahti (1988)\n\nThe inverse relationship between consonant gradation and medial lenition of stops (the pattern also continuing within the three families where gradation \"is\" found) is noted by Helimski (1995): an original allophonic gradation system between voiceless and voiced stops would have been easily disrupted by a spreading of voicing to previously unvoiced stops as well.\n\nA computational phylogenetic study by Honkola, et al. (2013) classifies the Uralic languages as follows. Estimated divergence dates from Honkola, et al. (2013) are also given.\n\n\nStructural characteristics generally said to be typical of Uralic languages include:\n\n\n\nBasic vocabulary of about 200 words, including body parts (e.g. eye, heart, head, foot, mouth), family members (e.g. father, mother-in-law), animals (e.g. viper, partridge, fish), nature objects (e.g. tree, stone, nest, water), basic verbs (e.g. live, fall, run, make, see, suck, go, die, swim, know), basic pronouns (e.g. who, what, we, you, I), numerals (e.g. two, five); derivatives increase the number of common words.\n\nThe following is a very brief selection of cognates in basic vocabulary across the Uralic family, which may serve to give an idea of the sound changes involved. This is not a list of translations: cognates have a common origin, but their meaning may be shifted and loanwords may have replaced them.\n\nOrthographical notes: The hacek denotes postalveolar articulation ( , , ) (In Northern Sami, ( ), while the acute denotes a secondary palatal articulation ( , , ) or, in Hungarian, vowel length. The Finnish letter and the letter in other languages represent the high rounded vowel ; the letters and are the front vowels and .\nAs is apparent from the list, Finnish is the most conservative of the Uralic languages presented here, with nearly half the words on the list below identical to their Proto-Uralic reconstructions and most of the remainder only having minor changes, such as the conflation of *ś into /s/, or widespread changes such as the loss of *x and alteration of *ï. Finnish has even preserved old Indo-European borrowings relatively unchanged as well. (An example is \"porsas\" (\"pig\"), loaned from Proto-Indo-European \"*porḱos\" or pre-Proto-Indo-Iranian \"*porśos\", unchanged since loaning save for loss of palatalization, *ś > s.)\n\nThe Estonian philologist Mall Hellam proposed cognate sentences that she asserted to be mutually intelligible among the three most widely spoken Uralic languages: Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian:\n\nHowever, linguist Geoffrey Pullum reports that neither Finns nor Hungarians could understand the other language's version of the sentence.\n\nNo Uralic language has exactly the idealized typological profile of the family. Typological features with varying presence among the modern Uralic language groups include:\n\nNotes:\n\nMany relationships between Uralic and other language families have been suggested, but none of these are generally accepted by linguists at the present time.\n\nThe Indo-Uralic (or Uralo-Indo-European) hypothesis suggests that Uralic and Indo-European are related at a fairly close level or, in its stronger form, that they are more closely related than either is to any other language family.\n\nThe Uralic–Yukaghir hypothesis identifies Uralic and Yukaghir as independent members of a single language family. It is currently widely accepted that the similarities between Uralic and Yukaghir languages are due to ancient contacts. Regardless, the hypothesis is accepted by a few linguists and viewed as attractive by a somewhat larger number.\n\nThe Eskimo–Uralic hypothesis associates Uralic with the Eskimo–Aleut languages. This is an old thesis whose antecedents go back to the 18th century. An important restatement of it is Bergsland 1959.\n\nUralo-Siberian is an expanded form of the Eskimo–Uralic hypothesis. It associates Uralic with Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo–Aleut. It was propounded by Michael Fortescue in 1998.\n\nTheories proposing a close relationship with the Altaic languages were formerly popular, based on similarities in vocabulary as well as in grammatical and phonological features, in particular the similarities in the Uralic and Altaic pronouns and the presence of agglutination in both sets of languages, as well as vowel harmony in some. For example, the word for \"language\" is similar in Estonian (\"keel\") and Mongolian (\"хэл\" (\"hel\")). These theories are now generally rejected and most such similarities are attributed to language contact or coincidence.\n\nNostratic associates Uralic, Indo-European, Altaic, Dravidian, and various other language families of Asia. The Nostratic hypothesis was first propounded by Holger Pedersen in 1903 and subsequently revived by Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky in the 1960s.\n\nEurasiatic resembles Nostratic in including Uralic, Indo-European, and Altaic, but differs from it in excluding the South Caucasian languages, Dravidian, and Afroasiatic and including Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Nivkh, Ainu, and Eskimo–Aleut. It was propounded by Joseph Greenberg in 2000–2002. Similar ideas had earlier been expressed by Heinrich Koppelmann in 1933 and by Björn Collinder in 1965.\n\nThe hypothesis that the Dravidian languages display similarities with the Uralic language group, suggesting a prolonged period of contact in the past, is popular amongst Dravidian linguists and has been supported by a number of scholars, including Robert Caldwell, Thomas Burrow, Kamil Zvelebil, and Mikhail Andronov. This hypothesis has, however, been rejected by some specialists in Uralic languages, and has in recent times also been criticised by other Dravidian linguists, such as Bhadriraju Krishnamurti.\n\nIn her book, \"The Uralic language family: facts, myths, and statistics\", linguist Angela Marcantonio argues against the existence of the Uralic family, claiming that the languages are no more closely related to each other than they are to various other Eurasian languages.\n\nAll of these hypotheses are minority views at the present time in Uralic studies.\n\nVarious unorthodox comparisons have been advanced such as Finno-Basque, Hungarian-Etruscan, and Cal-Ugrian. These are considered at best spurious fringe-theories by specialists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Walters (January 3, 1917 – February 10, 2002) was a United States Army officer and a diplomat. Most notably, he served from 1972 to 1976 as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, from 1985 to 1989 as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations and from 1989 to 1991 as Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany during the decisive phase of German Reunification. Walters rose to the rank of lieutenant general in the U.S. Army and is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.\n\nWalters was born in New York City. His father was a British immigrant and insurance salesman. From age 6, Walters lived in Britain and France with his family. His formal education beyond elementary school consisted entirely of boarding school instruction at Stonyhurst College, a 400-year-old Jesuit school in Lancashire, England. He did not attend a university. At the age of sixteen, he left school and returned to the United States, to work for his father as an insurance claims adjuster and investigator.\n\nIn later years, he seemed to enjoy reflecting on the fact that he had risen high and accomplished much despite a near-total lack of formal academic training.\n\nHe was fluent in French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese as well as his native English. He also spoke German fluently but, as he joked, inaccurately, and knew the basics of several other languages. His simultaneous translation of a speech by United States President Richard Nixon in France prompted French President Charles de Gaulle to say to Nixon, \"You gave a magnificent speech, but your interpreter was eloquent.\"\n\nWalters joined the Army in 1941 and was soon commissioned. He served in Africa and Italy during World War II. He served as a link between the commands of Brazilian Expeditionary Force and U.S. Fifth Army, earning medals for distinguished military and intelligence achievements.\n\nHe served as an aide and interpreter for several Presidents. He was at President Harry S. Truman's side as an interpreter in key meetings with America's Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Latin American allies. His language skills helped him win Truman's confidence, and he accompanied the President to the Pacific in the early 1950s, serving as a key aide in Truman's unsuccessful effort to reach a reconciliation with an insubordinate General Douglas MacArthur, the Commander of United Nations forces in Korea.\n\nIn Europe in the 1950s, Walters served President Dwight Eisenhower and other top US officials as a translator and aide at a series of NATO summit conferences. During this period he participated in the famous visit of Eisenhower to General Franco. He also worked in Paris at Marshall Plan headquarters and helped set up the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe. He was with then-Vice President Richard Nixon in 1958 when an anti-American crowd stoned their car in Caracas, Venezuela. Walters suffered facial cuts from flying glass. The Vice President avoided injury.\n\nIn the 1960s, Walters served as a U.S. military attaché in France, Italy, and Brazil. In 1961, he proposed an American military intervention in Italy if the Socialist Party had participated in the Government.\n\nWhile serving as a military attaché in Paris from 1967 to 1972, Walters played a role in secret peace talks with North Vietnam. He arranged to smuggle National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger into France for secret meetings with a senior North Vietnamese official, and then smuggle him out again. He accomplished this by borrowing a private airplane from an old friend, French President Georges Pompidou.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon appointed Walters as Deputy Director for Central Intelligence (DDCI) in 1972. (Walters also served as Acting DCI for two months in mid-1973.) During his four years as DDCI, he worked closely with four successive Directors as the Agency—and the nation—confronted such major international developments as the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the subsequent oil crisis, the turbulent end of the Vietnam War, and the Chilean military coup against the Allende government and the Letelier assassination. According to a close colleague, Walters also \"averted a looming catastrophe\" for the CIA in connection with the Watergate scandal:\n\nDespite numerous importunings from on high, [Walters] flatly refused to...cast a cloak of national security over the guilty parties. At the critical moment, he... refused to involve the Agency, and bluntly informed the highest levels of the executive [branch] that further insistence from that quarter would result in his immediate resignation.\n\nWalters himself reflected on those challenging days in his 1978 autobiography, \"Silent Missions\":\n\nI told [President Nixon's White House counsel] that on the day I went to work at the CIA I had hung on the wall of my office a color photograph showing the view through the window of my home in Florida…When people asked me what it was, I told them [this] was what was waiting [for me] if anyone squeezed me too hard.\n\nBeginning in 1981, Walters served under Ronald Reagan as roving ambassador. \nReagan used prominent Catholics in his government such as Walters to brief the pope during the Cold War.\nWalters was then United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 1985 to 1989 and ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany from 1989 to 1991. Here he was responsible on behalf of the United States for the preparations of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany.\n\nDuring the 1990s, after he had retired from public life, Walters worked as a business consultant and was active on the lecture circuit. On November 18, 1991, he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush. He wrote another book, \"The Mighty and the Meek\" (published in 2001), which profiled famous people with whom he had worked during his life.\n\nOn February 9, the day before his death he gave an interview (in French language) for the mockumentary \"Dark Side of the Moon\" (original title: \"Opération Lune\") by William Karel. This mockumentary suggests that the \"New York Herald Tribune\"'s article on his death included the following paragraph:\n\nGeneral Walters' last known public appearance was on a French Television documentary in which he talked about the White House's involvement with the Apollo program in the late 1960s. Both the producer and director noted that Walters was in perfect shape. [February 15, 2002]\n\nHowever, the web version of the article at the \"New York Times\" website uses a different paragraph: \n\nWalters was portrayed by Garrick Hagon in the 2002 BBC production of Ian Curteis's controversial \"The Falklands Play\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55339665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55339665", "title": "Video game writing", "text": "Video game writing\n\nVideo game writing is the art and craft of writing scripts for video games. Similar to screenwriting, it is typically a freelance profession. It includes many differences from writing for film, due to the non-linear and interactive nature of most video games, and the necessity to work closely with video game designers and voice actors. There are many differing types of text in video games in comparison to stage shows or movies, including written text, foreign or made-up languages, and often situation-based information. Especially when developing Triple A games, more than one writer will be required to create the game, split into different roles.\n\nPeople who write video games are part of the design team, during pre-production, and creates the main plot of a video game but can also focus on the dialogue, the character creation and development or the worldbuilding.\nDuring the game development process, the design may change and a video game writer can also be asked to fix the eventual narrative issues.\n\nThe importance of the plot can be minimized by some video game designers, for instance Harvey Smith of Arkane Studios claimed that \"The world is very important. The characters are very important. The plot? It can be thrown away. Because each gamer will build his own story.\". Moreover, according to academic and video game designer Ian Bogost video games can be much more than narrative media, by puting together, in a non-linear structure, elements of everyday life, as in \"What Remains of Edith Finch\".\n\nOne issue specific to the medium is that priority is given to interactive play mechanics over narrative which could lead to \"Ludonarrative dissonance\" : a situation when ludic and narrative elements are opposed to each other as \"Far Cry 2\" director, Clint Hocking defined the concept in his blog.\n\nAlso as video games are more recent than other media, video game writing is still a field to be conquered.\n\nThere is no specific training to video game writing and some video game writers – such as Tim Schafer and Sam Barlow – are also in charge of other game development tasks. In the video game industry, it is also one area where some women are very famous such as Roberta Williams and Jane Jensen.\n\nVideo game writing differs from writing for arts, due to the non-linear and interactive nature of most video games, and the necessity to work closely with video game designers and voice actors. There are many differing types of text in video games in comparison to stage shows or movies, including written text, foreign or made-up languages, and often situation-based information. Subsequently, more than one writer will often be used to create the game, split into different roles, with more specific job titles that can range from being a traditional writer, developing an overview of the story and how it reacts to the player, or creating a translation or localization.\n\nA pitch writer specializes in writing pitches for video games to publishers. They create collaborative pitch documents within a game studio that often contain design mockups or art concepts. The main parts of a pitch document, in order from first to last, are the executive summary, audience analysis, story, competition analysis, market analysis, gameplay, and budget and schedule.\n\nNarrative designer is a hybrid role of video game design and writing that creates not only the story, but also how it is communicated to players and how the game mechanics work to reinforce that story. Bioware writer David Gaider described the role as \"the person who shapes the game’s narrative, as well as the one who writes all the words.\"\n\nThe script writer focuses on the dialogue said by characters and the voice over. The script's dialogue can be written in flowcharts to illustrate the various dialogue resulting from both decision and indecision. Generally, a script writer is less involved with the video game's mechanics, and is tasked with writing and working with voice actors.\n\nSimilarly to screenplay script doctors, video game writers can be brought in to assist with writing-related tasks. However, the term is more vague than in screenplays due to the wide variety of potential tasks needed.\n\nSimilar to screenwriting, it is typically a freelance profession. Writing roles may also be filled by other members of the development team. \n"}
{"id": "7769856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7769856", "title": "Video remote interpreting", "text": "Video remote interpreting\n\nVideo remote interpreting (VRI) is a videotelecommunication service that uses devices such as web cameras or videophones to provide sign language or spoken language interpreting services. This is done through a remote or offsite interpreter, in order to communicate with persons with whom there is a communication barrier. It is similar to a slightly different technology called video relay service, where the parties are each located in different places. VRI is a type of telecommunications relay service (TRS) that is not regulated by the FCC.\n\nIn a typical VRI situation, the two parties are located together at one location with a videophone or web camera, and a television or computer screen. The interpreter works from another location—either an office, home-based studio or call center—also using a videophone or web camera and television or computer screen. The equipment must provide video and audio connectivity, or a separate telephone line can be used for audio. The video interpreter facilitates communication between the participants who are located together at the other site. In the case of Sign Language interpretation, the interpreter hears the voices of the hearing people through the microphone or telephone, and renders the message into sign language, via a video camera, which the deaf person views on his or her video display. In turn, when the deaf participants sign to the camera, interpreters view it from their screen, and speaks the aural interpretation into a microphone or telephone for the hearing people.\n\nVRI is a growing field. One popular application is in the hospital emergency room. In this setting, it is essential that patients and caregivers communicate readily with medical personnel, but it may take time for a face-to-face interpreter to arrive onsite. Hospitals with VRI capability can connect with a remote interpreter quickly and conduct triage and intake surveys with the patient or caregiver without significant delay. Also, employees who work in office settings are increasingly converting to VRI services to accommodate brief interactions or regular meetings which would be difficult to schedule with an onsite interpreter. Schools and businesses located in areas not adequately served by existing community interpreters can also benefit from increased access to professional interpreters and save the expense of vendor travel reimbursements.\n\nUsing VRI for medical, legal and mental health settings is seen as controversial by some in the deaf community, where there is an opinion that it does not provide appropriate communication access—particularly in medical settings where the patient's ability to watch the screen or sign clearly to the camera may be compromised. This is balanced by many in the services and public services sectors who identify with the benefits of being able to communicate in otherwise impossible (and sometimes life-threatening) situations without having to wait hours for an interpreter to turn up, even if this initial contact is used just to arrange a further face-to-face appointment. Therefore, businesses and organizations contend that it meets or exceeds the minimum threshold for reasonable accommodation as its principle is built around offering \"reasonable adjustment\" through increasing initial accessibility.\n\nVRI is distinct from Video Relay Service (VRS): typically VRI is a contracted service used by organizations to help them communicate with Limited English Proficient or Deaf/Hard of Hearing customers. VRS is principally a service provided to the deaf community, whereby a deaf person can contact the service, and use the interpreter to contact a third-party organisation. In the past, the term 'video relay service' had been used interchangeably with 'video relay interpreting', but currently the terms refer to two separate and distinct services. However, a 'video interpreter' (V.I.) may refer to the practitioner working in either setting. \n\nAccording to U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, deaf and hearing people in the same room are not permitted to use VRS to communicate, because the service is designated only for telephone calls, and receives funding from telecommunications relay service taxes. In the United States the FCC requires that if a VRS interpreter determines callers are in the same location, they must advise both parties that the interpreter must terminate the call. Video remote interpreting however, can either be provided for persons in the same location, or different locations, as long as the parties can see or hear the interpreter respectively, and vice versa.\n\nDespite criticism, VRI is proving to be a crucial tool in facilitating communication between those who ordinarily could not converse. For unplanned or emergency interactions, many organizations recognize significant benefits with the instant support provided by videotelephony. Face-to-face interpreting support is a much more personal method of advocacy, however such an interpreter needs to be scheduled in advance and is subject to travel (and associated) delays, also costing more than any other method.\n\nIn 2010, Chicago's Mercy Hospital and Medical Center carried out an investigation into new ways that the hospital could effectively meet the needs of its deaf and hard of hearing patients, with the ultimate goal to improve patient care and satisfaction, increase hospital efficiency and provide better value for money for all. Their conclusion focused on implementing an on-demand VRI service whereby hospital staff were able to access qualified, experienced Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) / National Association of the Deaf (NAD) certified American Sign Language interpreters via the Internet with delays as short as minutes. Dedicated laptop computers were made available for use by clinicians and are to this day the service is utilized across the hospital's departments. Notably the hospital has measured tangible results in increased patient flow and overall satisfaction.\n\nIn June 2011, the Windsor, Ontario, Canada, Police Service piloted a VRI service aimed at improving communication with the deaf, hard of hearing and people with other language barriers. The 30-day trial was deployed in the Emergency 911 Center, and proved so successful that they went on to incorporate the program into their Windsor Police Service Human Rights Project as a way of expanding services to people who are deaf or are Limited English Proficient. The cost to Windsor Police Services at that time was $50 per month and $3.25 per minute of use.\n\n\n\nwww.acutrans.com"}

For the team batting first, it gives the prediction of the final total. For the team batting second, it gives the probability of the chasing team winning, although it does not just take the match situation into the equation. Predictions are based on the average team playing against the average team in those conditions.\n\nThe models are based on a database of all non-shortened One Day International (ODI) matches and Twenty20 games played between top-eight countries since late 2006 (slightly further back for Twenty20 games). The batting-first model estimates the additional runs likely to be scored as a function of the number of balls and wickets remaining. The batting-second model estimates the probability of winning as a function of balls and wickets remaining, runs scored to date, and the target score. Projected score or required run-rate will not qualitatively show the real picture as they fail to take into the account the quality of the batting team and the quality of the bowling attack. WASP is a very good quantitative parameter.\n\nThe WASP technique is a product of some extensive research from PhD graduate Dr Scott Brooker and his supervisor Dr Seamus Hogan at the University of Canterbury (UC) in Christchurch, New Zealand. They worked on this project for four years and started after they received a phone call from the university's economics department asking them to investigate alternatives to the Duckworth–Lewis method.\n\nWASP was first introduced by Sky Sport New Zealand in November 2012 during Auckland's HRV Cup Twenty20 game against Wellington.\n\nThe WASP system is grounded in the theory of dynamic programming. It looks at data from past matches and estimates the probability of runs and wickets in each game situation, and works backwards to calculate the total runs or probability of winning in any situation.\n\nThis is how Dr Seamus Hogan – one of the creators of WASP – described the system:\n\nLet \"V\"(\"b\",\"w\") be the expected additional runs for the rest of the innings when \"b\" (legitimate) balls have been bowled and \"w\" wickets have been lost, and let \"r\"(\"b\",\"w\") and \"p\"(\"b\",\"w\") be, respectively, the estimated expected runs and the probability of a wicket on the next ball in that situation.\n\nWe can then write,\n\nSince \"V\"(\"b*\",\"w\")=0 where \"b\" equals the maximum number of legitimate deliveries allowed in the innings (300 in a 50 over game), we can solve the model backwards.\n\nThis means that the estimates for \"V\"(\"b\",\"w\") in rare situations depends only slightly on the estimated runs and probability of a wicket on that ball, and mostly on the values of \"V\"(\"b\" + 1,\"w\") and \"V\"(\"b\" + 1,\"w\" + 1), which will be mostly determined by thick data points.\n\nThe batting second model is a bit more complicated, but uses essentially the same logic.\n\nIf a batsman gets retired hurt, the model will not work well as it does not know the position in which the retired hurt batsman will come to bat again. This happened in a match between England and New Zealand, as injured Martin Guptill came to the crease again in the ninth position and gave a staggering performance which is unusual for a ninth position batsman and helped his team to win the match.\n\nWASP also fails when a team beats the predicted score batting first, as was the case when Black Caps beat the predicted score at Otago University Oval of 270 in the fourth game of the seven-game series against Sri Lanka by a large margin, when Grant Elliott and Luke Ronchi set the record for their highest 6th wicket partnership to set a score of 360/5, at which case, runs per over rate will resume showing. The team batting second will not have WASP showing if the likelihood of winning falls below 5% before the 5th over. These reasons make this unpopular outside of Sky broadcasts. Two days later, due to a greener surface, the predicted score at the same ground drops to 257 at the start of the match, which Black Caps still went on to post a score of 315/8. After those matches, Sky abandoned showing this statistic in future matches, and it was not featured during 2015 Cricket World Cup. WASP, however, was featured again in NatWest T20 Blast, ODI and Twenty20 broadcasts in England.\n"}

Well-formed words or phrases are grammatical, meaning they obey all relevant rules of grammar. In contrast, a form that violates some grammar rule is ill-formed and does not constitute part of the language.\n\nA word may be phonologically well-formed, meaning it conforms to the sound pattern of the language. A word, phrase, clause, or utterance may be grammatically well-formed, meaning it obeys the rules of morphology and syntax. A semantically well-formed utterance or sentence is one that is meaningful. Grammatical well-formedness and semantic well-formedness do not always coincide. For example, the following sentence is grammatically well-formed, but has no clear meaning.\n\nThe concept of well-formedness was developed in generative grammar during the twentieth century. Sometimes native speakers of a language do not agree whether a particular word, phrase, or clause is well-formed. This problem of gradient well-formedness, uncertainty about the well-formedness of a particular example, is a problem for generative linguistics, which assumes that grammar follows some universal patterns that should not vary among speakers.\n\nGradient well-formedness is a problem that arises in the analysis of data in generative linguistics, in which a linguistic entity is neither completely grammatical nor completely ungrammatical. A native speaker may judge a word, phrase or pronunciation as \"not quite right\" or \"almost there\", rather than dismissing it as completely unacceptable or fully accepting it as well-formed. Thus, the acceptability of the given entity lies on a \"gradient\" between well-formedness and ill-formedness. Some generative linguists think that ill-formedness might be strictly additive, thus trying to figure out universal constraints by acquiring scalar grammaticality judgements from informants. Generally, however, gradient well-formedness is considered an unsolved problem in generative linguistics.\n\n\n"}
