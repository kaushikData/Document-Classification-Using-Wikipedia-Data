He was married, according to the custom of those times, as soon as he had celebrated his \"bar mitzvah\" / \"Bar Mistvo\" ; and he spent the following eight years with his wife's parents in Michailishki, in the government of Vilna. This gave him the surname \"Michailishker,\" by which he was popularly known; and it also accounts for the last letter in his pen-name \"Adam\" (formed from the initials of Abraham Dob Michailishker), while the family name \"Lebensohn,\" which he adopted, is a literal translation of \"ben Ḥayyim.\" / \"Beyn Cayim\" . He afterward lived about four years in Oshmiany, in the government of Vilna, where he attempted to establish himself as a merchant. He was now an accomplished rabbinic scholar; but he devoted most of his leisure time to the study of Hebrew poetical and grammatical works. On returning to his native city, where he remained for the rest of his life, he engaged in teaching, a profession which he followed until his old age, except for about fifteen years in which he was engaged in the business of a broker.\n\nHis first poetical work to be published was the \"Shir Ḥabibim\" / \"Shir Chovivim\" (Vilnius, 1822), in honor of the marriage of Count Tyszkiewicz, one of the most powerful noblemen of Lithuania. It was followed by \"Ebel Kabed\" / \"Eyvel Koveyd\" (ib. 1825), an elegy on the death of R. Saul Katzenellenbogen; this established the author's reputation as a Hebrew poet. The publication of the first volume of his poetry, entitled \"Shire Sefat Ḳodesh\" / \"Shirey Sfas Kodesh\" (Leipzig, 1842; 2d ed. Vilnius, 1863), marks the beginning of a new epoch in Neo-Hebrew literature in Lithuania. It is the first poetical work of the rejuvenated literature that can be favorably compared with the works of that nature which were produced in western European countries. It was received with unbounded enthusiasm. Thousands of young men in sympathy with the Haskalah movement, of which Lebensohn became the leading exponent in Lithuania, learned to recite the songs of \"Shire Sefat Ḳodesh\" / \"Shirey Sfas Kodesh\" by heart; and the fame of the author spread to all centers of Hebrew learning.\n\nWhen Sir Moses Montefiore visited Vilnius in 1846, Lebensohn prepared for his perusal an article on the condition of the Jews in Russia and the means by which it was to be improved. This interesting document, embodying the views held by the \"Maskilim\" of that period, summarized the evils from which the Jews suffered and boldly stated that they were themselves to blame for their troubles. Lack of education and of skill in handicrafts, too early marriages, the ignorance of the rabbis and teachers, and extravagance were described as the four \"abot neziḳin\" / \"Ayveys Nezikin\" or chief faults; and relief was proposed, as was customary in those times, through governmental intervention (see I. M. Dick, \"Ha-Oraḥ,\" and Lebensohn, \"Yeter Shire Adam\" / \"Yeser Shirey Oydom\" pp. 67 et seq.).\n\nIn 1848, Lebensohn was made one of the principal teachers in the newly established rabbinical school of Vilna, a position which he creditably filled for nearly twenty years, until he was forced by age and impaired eyesight to relinquish it. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Joshua Steinberg. Also in 1848, he began, conjointly with the bibliographer Benjacob / \"Yitschok Beyn-Yaynkov\", the publication of a new edition of the Bible, with a German translation, himself adding valuable glosses to the \"bi'ur\" / \"Biyuyr\" (\"Miḳra'e Ḳodesh,\" / \"Mikroyey Kodesh\", Vilna, 1848–53). Some of his commentaries on the Bible were later printed separately as a supplement to that edition (\"Bi'urim Ḥadashim,\" / \"Biyuyrim Chadoshim\", ib. 1858). A second volume of \"Shire Sefat Ḳodesh\" / \"Shirey Sfas Kodesh\" appeared in Vilna in 1856 (2d ed., ib. 1869); and in 1869 was published \"Yeter Shire Adam\" / \"Yeser Shirey Oydom\" the third volume of the same work, containing also poems written by his son Micah Joseph Lebensohn / \"Micho Yeyseyf Leybenzon\" . The most important of his later works are the allegorical drama \"Emet we-Emunah\" / \"Eymes VeYeymuno\" (ib. 1867; 2d ed., ib. 1870), which has for its theme the harmonization of science and religion; and \"Yitron le-Adam\" / \"Yisreyn LeYoydom\" (ib. 1874), a commentary on Ben-Ze'eb's (Traditional Jewish Lithuanian pronunciation:\"Beyn-Zyeyv\") well-known Hebrew grammar, \"Talmud Leshon 'Ibri\" / \"Talmud Lesheyn Iyvri\" with which it has been often reprinted. A new edition of the three volumes of \"Shire Sefat Ḳodesh\" / \"Shirey Sfas Kodesh\" appeared in Vilna in 1895.\n\nLebensohn was the author of several other, unimportant, works and of numerous articles in the periodicals. He exercised almost as much influence by his powerful personality as by his literary efforts, and was recognized in his later years as the pioneer of \"haskalah\" in northwestern Russia. The \"Maskilim\" of Vilna considered themselves as his pupils, while the fanatics saw in him the embodiment of all the objectionable features of the progressivist movement.\n\nHe had two sons, Micah Joseph Lebensohn, cited above, and Aryeh Löb Lebensohn (Traditional Lithuanian Jewish pronunciation: \"Ayryey Leyb Leybenzon\"), who was a prominent businessman in Vilna.\n\n\n"}

These sediments consist of cholesterol crystals, calcium salts, calcium bilirubinate, mucin, and other materials.\n\nBiliary sludge may cause complications such as biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis.\n\nThe pathophysiology of biliary sludge formation is likely related to gallbladder dysmotility. It is presumed that because the gallbladder is unable to effectively empty, the biliary sludge can start to accumulate.\n\nBiliary sludge has been associated with pregnancy, rapid weight loss, total parenteral nutrition, drugs such as ceftriaxone and octreotide, solid organ transplantation, and gastric surgery. In many of these conditions, it is thought that the impairment in the contractility of the gallbladder leads to the formation of the sludge.\n\nBiliary sludge is typically diagnosed by CT scan or transabdominal ultrasonography. Endoscopic ultrasonography is another more sensitive option. However, the gold standard is considered to be direct microscopy of aspirated gallbladder bile. This method is much more sensitive, although it is less practical.\n\nFor patients without symptoms, no treatment is recommended. If patients become symptomatic and/or develop complications, cholecystectomy is indicated. For those who are poor surgical candidates, endoscopic sphincterotomy may be performed to reduce the risk of developing pancreatitis.\nThe clinical course of biliary sludge can do one of three things: (1) it can resolve completely, (2) wax and wane, or (3) progress to gallstones. If the biliary sludge has a cause (e.g. pregnancy), it oftentimes is resolved when the underlying cause is removed.\n\nThe prevalence of biliary sludge is low in the general population. It has been reported that the prevalence ranges from 0-0.20% in men and 0.18-0.27% in women. However, in patients with certain conditions, the prevalence may be higher.\n\n"}

{"id": "22755580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22755580", "title": "Case of Proclamations", "text": "Case of Proclamations\n\nThe Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 was a court decision during the reign of King James VI and I (1603-1625) which defined some limitations on the Royal Prerogative at that time. Principally, it established that the Monarch could make laws only through Parliament. The judgment began to set out the principle in English law (later developed by future Parliaments and other members of the judiciary in subsequent cases, for example \"Dr. Bonham's Case\") that when a case involving an alleged exercise of prerogative power came before the courts, the courts could determine:\n\n\nTudor monarchs believed that they had the power to regulate, through the issue of royal proclamations, without the consent of Parliament. However, the monarch's absolute power to \"make\" the law was beginning to be challenged by the English judiciary and was raising concern in Parliament itself. The issue of the King's power to make law came before the judges in 1610 when James I and Parliament were struggling over the issue of impositions. Parliament was opposing the King's power to impose further duties on imports over and above what had already been sanctioned by Parliament. James however hoped to use proclamations to raise further money outside of Parliament. \n\nOn 20 September 1610, Sir Edward Coke, then Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was called before the Privy Council of England alongside Lord Chief Justice Thomas Fleming, Lord Chief Baron Lawrence Tanfield, and Baron James Altham and asked to give a legal opinion as to whether the King, by proclamation, might prohibit new buildings in London, or the making of starch or wheat, these having been referred to the King by the House of Commons as grievances and against law. Coke asked for time to consider with other judges, since the questions were \"of great importance, and they concerned the answer of the king to the Commons\".\n\nCoke and his fellow judges ruled that the power of the King to create new offences was outlawed and that the King could not by proclamation prohibit new buildings in and around London; i.e., the Royal Prerogative could not be extended into areas not previously sanctioned by law:\n\nIn giving his judgment, Chief Justice Coke set out the principle that the King had no power to declare new offences by proclamation:\n\nConsequently, the King had no power by which to arbitrarily, through royal proclamations, prohibit the erection of new buildings in London, nor the making of wheat starch without the consent of Parliament, because this power had not previously been granted by Parliament to the King by the making of statute law. James however did not concede this point and attempted to place all of his proclamations on a constitutional footing, having them published in a book as if they were statutes. He went to argue that proclamations were necessary to \"apply speedy, proper, and convenient remedies ... in matters so variable and irregular in their nature, as are not provided for by Law, nor can fitly fall under the certain rule of a law\".\n\nIn future English history, the issue of proclamations would form part of the many grievances and issues in dispute between both James I and Charles I and their Parliaments before the English Civil War. MPs would go on to cite Coke's judgment in the \"Case of Impositions\" to support their arguments against the arbitrary use of royal power in the years up to 1641. Whilst disputed, the case is seen by some historians and jurists as influential in the development of the concept of judicial review in English common law. However, the issue about the extent of the royal prerogative was not properly resolved until the Bill of Rights 1689 \"established that the powers of the Crown were subject to law, and there were no powers of the Crown which could not be taken away or controlled by statute\".\n\nOver 400 years on, the Case of Proclamations continues to affect the constitutional law of the UK. It was cited by a Divisional Court of the High Court in its landmark judicial review decision, \"Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union\", concerning whether the UK government had the power, under the Crown's foreign affairs prerogative, to serve a notice triggering Brexit following the \"leave\" vote in the 2016 EU Referendum. The Divisional Court cited two principles from the Case of Proclamations: \nThe Divisional Court unanimously rejected the government's argument in robust terms (which were subsequently upheld by a majority of the Supreme Court). The court concluded that the government did not have the right to rely on royal prerogative to serve a notice pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, triggering the formal process for the UK to leave the EU. The court added that, because Brexit would directly affect substantive legal rights under UK domestic law, only Parliament could decide whether to serve such a notice.\n"}

If this continues, the objects will collide.\n\nSailors, especially deck hands and those who stand watch on the bridge, are trained to watch for this situation and make it known when they detect it happening. The reasoning is subtle: non-sailors who are used to driving automobiles normally are able to detect the possible risk of a collision with implicit reference to the background (e.g., the street, the scenery, the landscape, etc.) At sea, when vessels are borne in water, the sea surface removes this vital visual clue. Unaware individuals tend to gauge the risk of two vessels colliding based on which direction each vessel is heading. In other words, a novice will think that two vessels which appear to be heading apart from each other cannot collide. This is false, as when a faster vessel is overtaking a slower one, they can in fact have a collision even though the vessels are on substantially different headings.\n\nOn a river, CBDR is less useful, as it is likely that both the observed and the observing vessel will follow curving courses along the waterway, whether or not they are on a collision course. In such situations safe navigation depends on upstream and downstream traffic keeping to separate sectors of the navigable channel.\n\nWhen a non-moving background (typically the shore line) is present, CBDR situations can be recognized by the fact that some part of the moving target vessel is not visually moving against the background. On the other hand, if the target vessel visually moves forward against the background, with relative bearing decreasing, then the target vessel will pass in front of the observing vessel and there is no risk of collision, provided both vessels maintain constant speed and course. Similarly, if the target vessel visually moves backwards against the background, with relative bearing increasing, the target vessel will pass behind the observing vessel. However, this method of recognizing non-CBDR conditions is only true for relatively small observing vessels. With larger vessels, only an observer positioned near the bow can reliably make the first conclusion, whereas the second conclusion can only be left to an observer positioned near the stern.\n\nAnother source of confusion arises from the distinction between \"relative bearing\" and \"absolute bearing\". One might think that another vessel which seems to be progressing from, perhaps, dead ahead to apparent movement down one's starboard side cannot result in a collision. This is not quite true. Because a vessel afloat can change its true heading (relative to north) without obvious detection (unless there are landmarks in sight) two vessels may collide even if one presents a substantially changing relative bearing.\n\n"}

{"id": "86314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86314", "title": "Goalkeeper", "text": "Goalkeeper\n\nIn many team sports which involve scoring goals, the goalkeeper (termed goaltender, netminder, goalie or keeper in some sports) is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring by intercepting shots at goal. Such positions exist in hurling, shinty, association football, Gaelic football, international rules football, handball, field hockey, bandy, rink bandy, rinkball, floorball, roller hockey, ice hockey, ringette, water polo, lacrosse, camogie, and other sports.\n\nUsually special rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to other players. These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper, being an obvious target for dangerous or even violent actions. In certain sports like ice hockey and lacrosse, goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object (e.g. a puck). In some sports, goalkeepers may have the same rights as other players; in association football, for example, the keeper is allowed to kick the ball just as any other player, but may also handle it in a restricted area. In other sports goalkeepers may be limited in the actions they are allowed to take or the area of the field where they may be; in the NHL, for example, goalkeepers may not play the puck in the restricted areas behind the net or take the puck across the red line. Goalkeepers are usually the tallest players on the field.\n\nIn football, each team's goalkeeper defends his/her team's goal and has special privileges within the game. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. \nThe goalkeeper is the only player in the side who may use his or her hands and arms to catch, throw and save the ball, but only within his/her own penalty area. Goalkeepers are required to wear a distinctive color jersey, separate from the referee's jersey color and either team's regular jersey color, so the referee can easily identify them. There are no other specific requirements, but goalkeepers are usually allowed to wear additional protective gear such as padded clothing. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves to protect their hands and enhance their grip of the ball. Like every player on the pitch, they are required to wear shin guards.\n\nThe goalkeeper is allowed to catch the ball, and is also allowed to punch or deflect the ball away from the goal. The goalkeeper generally has a significant advantage on a ball high in the air, as \nhe or she can raise their arms and play the ball before an attacker can attempt a header. When the keeper picks up the ball, they are allowed to kick it or throw it, or to place it on the ground and play it with his feet. The official Laws of the Game stipulate that once the goalkeeper has picked up the ball, he or she must redistribute it within six seconds; however, referees often use their discretion as long as the goalkeeper is not obviously attempting to waste time. Once the keeper establishes possession of the ball, opposing players are not allowed to attempt to play the ball and must give the goalkeeper room to attempt a kick. If a ball is in the air and both the goalkeeper and a field player of the opposing team are challenging for the ball, advantage usually goes to the goalkeeper because he or she is not able to protect themselves.\n\nThough the goalkeeper is generally allowed to use their hands in the penalty box area, they are not allowed to use their hands on balls that have been intentionally kicked to them by a teammate (it does not actually have to go backwards). In such situations, the goalkeeper may play the ball with their feet, but cannot pick the ball up. The rule applies only to a ball which is actually kicked. A ball which is headed or otherwise not kicked may be picked up by the goalkeeper without penalty. An infringement of this rule results in an indirect kick to the opposing team. The referee has some discretion in making this call. For example, a ball which is merely deflected by a teammate may still be picked up by the goalkeeper. The \"back-pass\" rule has been followed in international football and in most professional and amateur leagues since the early 1990s, but leagues for younger players may choose not to enforce the rule. The back pass rule is listed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game.\n\nAs the goalkeeper is usually the team's only player who can see the entire field, they often act as the organizer of the team when it is defending, such as on a free kick or a corner kick. This means the goalkeeper needs to be loud, with a voice that can project over the defensive area of the pitch. In turn, the players on their team need to be able to listen and respond to directions called to them.\n\nIn field hockey, the goalkeeper generally wears extensive protective equipment including helmet, face and neck guards, chest and leg padding, arm or elbow protectors, special gloves (the left glove is designed purely to block the ball, the right glove also has this function but in addition is designed to permit the goalkeeper to hold and use his or her stick), lower leg guards (known as pads) and shoe covers (known as kickers). The gloves, pads and kickers are almost always made of special high density foam material that both protects the goalkeeper and has excellent rebound qualities. He or she is also equipped with a stick; either one designed for goalies or one as used for normal play. Specialist goalkeeper sticks must conform to the same dimensional limitations as field players' sticks but are designed for optimal use with one hand and for blocking rather than hitting the ball. From 2007 teams may elect to play with 11 field players, and no-one has the privileges of a goalkeeper. If a goalkeeper is used, they fall into one of two categories: a fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, unless they are nominated to take a penalty stroke against the opposing goalkeeper, wear a different colored shirt and at least foot and leg guards (arm and upper-body protection is optional); or they may opt to wear only a helmet. The goalkeeper is allowed to use any part of their body to play or deflect the ball, although they can't obstruct its play (for example by lying on top of it), and they can only do so within the goal circle (or \"D\"). Outside the D they are subject to the same rules as field players and may only use their stick to play the ball. Goalkeepers who are wearing a helmet are not permitted to pass their team's 23 m line, with the exception of goalkeepers who take penalty strokes. However a goalkeeper who has elected to wear only a helmet is permitted to remove it and provided it is not left on the field of play, they may take part in the game in any part of the pitch, and retain their goalkeeping privileges, even if they do not have time to replace the helmet before making a save. It is compulsory to wear a helmet when defending a penalty stroke or penalty corner.\n\nIn floorball, the goalkeeper defends his team's goal and has special privileges within the game. He is the only player who may use his hands to play the ball. Goalkeepers do not have sticks, and they move in the goal crease on their knees, attempting to save the shots on goal. When the goalkeeper has possession of the ball, he has 3 seconds to throw it back into the game. He may not control the ball outside of his crease, except when kicking it. Goalkeepers are an essential part of starting plays, as they can throw the ball for a quick offensive chance. When throwing, the ball has to touch the goalkeeper's own side first before crossing the center line. Goalkeepers are also important in organizing their team's games, as they see the whole field better. Any contact against the goalkeeper (slashing, interference etc.) will result in a free shot or a 2-minute penalty. Like in ice hockey, the goalkeeper may be substituted for an extra attacker, if a delayed penalty occurs, or if his team needs a goal to tie the game in the final moments of the game. Goalkeepers may score goals, although this is not the case in some leagues. In floorball games, more goals are often scored than in, for example, ice hockey, because of the extremely quick tempo of the game and fast shots.\n\nThe only mandatory equipment for goalkeepers are masks, goalie-shirts, goalie-pants and shoes. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves. They may also optionally wear other protective equipment, such as knee pads, elbow-guards, shin-guards, jocks and torso armor. In some junior/independent leagues, many goalkeepers don't even wear goalie-shirts, but hooded tops.\n\nIn Gaelic football, the goalie's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored against his side by directly defending the team's goal. A goal occurs when the ball passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 3 points. The goalie is the only player who may handle the ball on the ground, and only inside the small rectangle.\n\nThe term \"goal-tend\" was used in early descriptions of American football positions to describe the defensive position farthest back from the line of scrimmage. Eventually the term became obsolete and was replaced by the term \"defensive fullback\", then to its modern term \"free safety\" (or \"punt returner\" in kicking situations). Unlike in soccer or Gaelic football, the goal-tend/safety does not physically protect the goalposts, as they are elevated above the ground and mostly out of the reach of any player. Also unlike other codes of football, goal-tends have no special ball-handling privileges.\n\nOne situation in which a goalkeeper-like responsibility can arise is in Canadian football, where a single point is awarded for a kicked ball that is not returned out of the end zone. While standard practice is for defending teams to concede the single point, situations often arise where conceding that point could jeopardize a lead. A goal-tend can thus be employed to recover the ball and either return it out of the end zone or, generally if it is in the closing seconds of a game, punt the ball back into play or out of bounds to ensure the point is not conceded.\n\nIn hurling, the goalkeeper's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored against his side by directly defending the team's goal. He also takes \"puckouts\" after a score or wide ball. A goal occurs when the ball passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 3 points. The goalkeeper has one special rule pertaining to him, opposing players may not directly physically challenge him while he is in possession of the ball in the small parallelogram, although they may harass him, while if he leaves the small parallelogram he is subject to the same rules as all other players. He wears a different color jersey, e.g., if a team has blue jerseys with white font, the goalkeeper will wear a white jersey of the same design with blue font. Most goalkeepers use a special hurley with a wider \"bas\" (flat face) to aid shot-stopping.\n\nIn bandy, the goalkeeper defends his team's goal and has special privileges within the game, which is regulated in section 6 of the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy The goalkeeper's main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. He is allowed to hold the ball for six seconds before he has to release it. He may drop it to a defender or chuck it directly into attack.\n\nIf the ball passes the goal line, it is followed by different actions: \n\nThe goalkeeper is the only player who may use his or her hands to play the ball (although only within the penalty area). According to Rule 6.1 the goalkeeper is required to wear a jersey with a different color from either team's jersey color to avoid confusion for the referee. Goalkeepers wear padded gloves to aid in catching the ball, large shinpads, a padded sweater, and a helmet with a face mask.\n\nHe is the only player in the team who can pass the ball to a teammate by aid of his skates. The team might have a reserve goalkeeper, and the two may switch at any time during the game, without the need to notify the referee. There is no time-out in bandy, but an exception is sometimes made when the goalkeeper is hurt, especially if they don't have a designated reserve keeper.\n\nAs the goalkeeper is usually the team's only player who can see the entire field, they often act as an organizer of the team when it is defending, especially for free strokes against them.\n\nKnown as the \"goaltender\" in ice hockey, the player defends their team's goal net by stopping shots of the puck from entering the net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \"goal crease\" (often referred to simply as \" the crease\" or \"the net\"). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any one time.\n\nIn International rules football, a hybrid game between Australian rules football (which does not have a goalkeeper) and Gaelic football, the goalkeeper's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored. A goal occurs when the ball comes off any part of an attacking player and passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 6 points.\n\nIn men's field lacrosse, the designated goalkeeper is allowed to have a stick from 40inches to 72inches long and the head of a goalkeeper's crosse may measure up to 12inches wide. This is significantly larger than field players' heads to assist in blocking shots. Once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in his crosse (stick), he may only remain in possession of the ball inside the protective crease for four seconds (the length may depend on the level of play). Before the four seconds is up, the goalkeeper must either pass the ball or leave the crease. After leaving, he may not re-enter the crease with possession of the ball.\n\nWhile inside the crease (nine feet in radius), offensive players may not make contact with the goalie or his stick. Doing so is declared \"goalie interference\" and is penalized by a free clear to the half field line. (There is a significant difference between NCAA/MLL rules and international rules regarding a pass while the goalkeeper is inside the crease: under NCAA/MLL rules, contact with a goalie's stick while in the act of passing, even after the ball is released, is prohibited and considered interference. Under international rules, protection ends when possession ends. Therefore, contact with a goalie's stick after the ball is released, is legal.) In addition, a goalie is allowed to make contact with the ball with his hand, although he is not allowed to control it or pick it up.\n\nIn women's lacrosse, once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in her crosse, she may remain in possession of the ball inside the crease for ten seconds. The interference rule is similar to men's lacrosse; unlike in the men's game, a woman goalkeeper is allowed to control or even pick up the ball in her hand.\n\nIn both men's and women's lacrosse, goalkeepers are required to wear a helmet and 4-point chinstrap, a throat protector, gloves, and a chest protector. Use of a protective cup is, for obvious reasons, required in the men's game; thigh pads and shinguards are also being required for women goalkeepers as of 2007. Although they are permitted to, few goalkeepers elect to wear optional protective equipment, including elbow and shoulder pads, thigh pads and shin guards, and long sweat pants.\n\nSince the creation of indoor or box lacrosse in the 1930s, a unique form of lacrosse goaltender was formed for the different dynamics of lacrosse on an ice-less ice hockey pad.\n\nGoalkeepers in water polo are granted some special privileges when inside the five meter area:\n\n\nHowever, they have one limitation that field players do not have: they may not cross the half-distance line.\n\nRule change in 2006:\n\nThe four and seven meter lines were merged to a five-meter line. A goalie may now under revised rules:\n\nNew cap rules:\n\nThese revisions are according to the NFHS 2006-2007 swimming/diving and water polo rulebook. USWP and NCAA rules may vary slightly.\n\nThe water polo goalkeeper is the least protected goalkeeper with no gloves or body protection.\n\nIn handball, the goalkeeper is the only player in the team who is allowed to stay in the 6-meter zone throughout the whole competition. A goalkeeper is allowed to save the ball with all parts of his body, including two hands, trunks, two legs and so on, only within the defending 6-meter zone.\n\nWhenever the ball is left on the ground within the 6-meter zone, the goalkeeper owns the possession of the ball; while whenever the ball is in the air above the 6-meter zone, the opponent can still jump in to grasp the ball without stepping in the 6-meter zone.\n\nA goalkeeper can participate in offense by long-passing the ball to a teammate in the opposing half court for a fast-break score.\n\nCommon handball goalkeeper clothing:\n\nIn netball, the Goal Keeper (denoted GK) must stay within the defensive third of the court. A goal keeper is one of four positions allowed within the shooting circle (along with the Goal Defence, Goal Attack and Goal Shooter). The Goal Keeper often matches up against the opposing side's Goal Shooter.\n\nGoalkeepers have been used on some collectors' coins and medals such as the Austrian 5 euro 100 years of football coin that was minted on 12 May 2004. The coin depicts a successful shot by a footballer, shown in the background, with the ball just passing the goalkeeper (still in the air) into the goal.\n\n"}
{"id": "126844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=126844", "title": "Internationalization and localization", "text": "Internationalization and localization\n\nIn computing, internationalization and localization are means of adapting computer software to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target locale. Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components. Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once, or as an integral part of ongoing development).\n\nThe terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms i18n (where \"18\" stands for the number of letters between the first \"i\" and the last \"n\" in the word \"internationalization\", a usage coined at Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1970s or 1980s) and \"L10n\" for \"localization\", due to the length of the words.\n\nSome companies, like IBM and Sun Microsystems, use the term \"globalization\", \"g11n\", for the combination of internationalization and localization. Also known as \"glocalization\" (a portmanteau of \"globalization\" and \"localization\").\n\nMicrosoft defines internationalization as a combination of world-readiness and localization. World-readiness is a developer task, which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures (globalization) and separating user interface resources in a localizable format (localizability, abbreviated to \"L12y\").\n\nHewlett-Packard and HP-UX created a system called \"National Language Support\" or \"Native Language Support\" (NLS) to produce localizable software.\n\nAccording to \"Software without frontiers\", the design aspects to consider when internationalizing a product are \"data encoding, data and documentation, software construction, hardware device support, user interaction\"; while the key design areas to consider when making a fully internationalized product from scratch are \"user interaction, algorithm design and data formats, software services, documentation\".\n\nTranslation is typically the most time-consuming component of language localization. This may involve:\n\nComputer software can encounter differences above and beyond straightforward translation of words and phrases, because computer programs can generate content dynamically. These differences may need to be taken into account by the internationalization process in preparation for translation. Many of these differences are so regular that a conversion between languages can be easily automated. The Common Locale Data Repository by Unicode provides a collection of such differences. Its data is used by major operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, macOS and Debian, and by major Internet companies or projects such as Google and the Wikimedia Foundation. Examples of such differences include:\n\nDifferent countries have different economic conventions, including variations in:\nIn particular, the United States and Europe differ in most of these cases. Other areas often follow one of these.\n\nSpecific third-party services, such as online maps, weather reports, or payment service providers, might not be available worldwide from the same carriers, or at all.\n\nTime zones vary across the world, and this must be taken into account if a product originally only interacted with people in a single time zone. For internationalization, UTC is often used internally and then converted into a local time zone for display purposes.\n\nDifferent countries have different legal requirements, meaning for example:\n\nLocalization also may take into account differences in culture, such as:\n\nIn order to \"internationalize\" a product, it is important to look at a variety of markets that the product will foreseeably enter.\n\nDetails such as field length for street addresses, unique format for the address, ability to make the postal code field optional to address countries that do not have postal codes or the state field for countries that do not have states, plus the introduction of new registration flows that adhere to local laws are just some of the examples that make internationalization a complex project.\n\nA broader approach takes into account cultural factors regarding for example the adaptation of the business process logic or the inclusion of individual cultural (behavioral) aspects.\n\nAlready in the 1990s, companies such as Bull used machine translation (Systran) in large scale, for all their translation activity: human translators handled pre-editing (making the input machine-readable) and post-editing.\n\nBoth in re-engineering an existing software or designing a new internationalized software, the first step of internationalization is to split each potentially locale-dependent part (whether code, text or data) into a separate module. Each module can then either rely on a standard library/dependency or be independently replaced as needed for each locale.\n\nThe current prevailing practice is for applications to place text in resource strings which are loaded during program execution as needed. These strings, stored in resource files, are relatively easy to translate. Programs are often built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data.\n\nThe storage for translatable and translated strings is sometimes called a message catalog as the strings are called messages. The catalog generally comprises a set of files in a specific localization format and a standard library to handle said format. One software library and format that aids this is gettext.\n\nThus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime. The code required to manage data entry verification and many other locale-sensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements. Modern development systems and operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of these types, see also Standard locale data above.\n\nMany localization issues (e.g. writing direction, text sorting) require more profound changes in the software than text translation. For example, OpenOffice.org achieves this with compilation switches.\n\nA globalization method includes, after planning, three implementation steps: internationalization, localization and quality assurance.\n\nTo some degree (e.g. for quality assurance), development teams include someone who handles the basic/central stages of the process which then enable all the others. Such persons typically understand foreign languages and cultures and have some technical background. Specialized technical writers are required to construct a culturally appropriate syntax for potentially complicated concepts, coupled with engineering resources to deploy and test the localization elements.\n\nOnce properly internationalized, software can rely on more decentralized models for localization: free and open source software usually rely on self-localization by end-users and volunteers, sometimes organized in teams. The KDE3 project, for example, has been translated into over 100 languages; MediaWiki in 270 languages, of which 100 mostly complete .\n\nWhen translating existing text to other languages, it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of texts throughout the life of the product. For instance, if a message displayed to the user is modified, all of the translated versions must be changed.\n\nIn a commercial setting, the benefit from localization is access to more markets. In the early 1980s, Lotus 1-2-3 took two years to separate program code and text and lost the market lead in Europe over Microsoft Multiplan. MicroPro found that using an Austrian translator for the West German market caused its WordStar documentation to, an executive said, not \"have the tone it should have had\".\n\nHowever, there are considerable costs involved, which go far beyond engineering. Further, business operations must adapt to manage the production, storage and distribution of multiple discrete localized products, which are often being sold in completely different currencies, regulatory environments and tax regimes.\n\nFinally, sales, marketing and technical support must also facilitate their own operations in the new languages, in order to support customers for the localized products. Particularly for relatively small language populations, it may thus never be economically viable to offer a localized product. Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product, and a product's internal structure already permits localization, a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "390915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390915", "title": "Khoekhoe language", "text": "Khoekhoe language\n\nThe Khoekhoe language , \"Khoekhoegowab\", also known by the ethnic term Nama and formerly as Hottentot, is the most widespread of those non-Bantu languages of southern Africa that contain \"click\" sounds and have therefore been loosely classified as Khoisan. It belongs to the Khoe language family, and is spoken in Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa by three ethnic groups, the Nama, Damara, and Haiǁom.\n\nIt appears that the Damara picked up the language along with the Nama in Botswana, and that they migrated to Namibia separately from the Nama . The Haiǁom, who had spoken a Juu language, later shifted to Khoekhoe. The name for Nama speakers, \"Khoekhoen\", is from the Nama word \"khoe\" \"person\", with reduplication and the suffix \"-n\" to indicate the plural . Georg Friedrich Wreede was the first European to study the language, after arriving in Cape Town in 1659 .\n\nKhoekhoe is a national language in Namibia, where it is used for teaching up to the university level as well as in the public administration . In Namibia and South Africa, state-owned broadcasting corporations produce and broadcast radio programmes in Khoekhoegowab.\n\nModern scholars generally see three dialects: \n\nThey are distinct enough that they might be considered two or three distinct languages .\n\n\nThere are 5 vowel qualities, found as oral and nasal . is strongly rounded, only slightly so. is the only vowel with notable allophony; it is pronounced before or .\n\nNama has been described as having three or four tones, or , which may occur on each mora (vowels and final nasal consonants). The high tone is higher when it occurs on one of the high vowels () or on a nasal () than on mid or low vowels ().\n\nThe tones combine into a limited number of 'tone melodies' (word tones), which have sandhi forms in certain syntactic environments. The most important melodies, in their citation and main sandhi forms, are as follows:\n\nWithin a phrase, lexical words receive greater stress than grammatical words. Within a word, the first syllable receives the most stress. Subsequent syllables receive less and less stress and are spoken more and more quickly.\n\nNama has 31 consonants: 20 clicks and only 11 non-clicks.\n\nBetween vowels, is pronounced and is pronounced . The affricate series is strongly aspirated, and may be analysed phonemically as aspirated stops; in the related Korana they are .\n\nBeach (1938) reported that the Khoehkoe of the time had a velar lateral ejective affricate, , a common realisation or allophone of in languages with clicks. This sound no longer occurs in Khoekhoe but remains in its cousin Korana.\n\nThe clicks are doubly articulated consonants. Each click consists of one of four primary articulations or \"influxes\" and one of five secondary articulation or \"effluxes\". The combination results in 20 phonemes.\n\nThe aspiration on the aspirated clicks is often light but is 'raspier' than the aspirated nasal clicks, with a sound approaching the \"ch\" of Scottish \"loch\". The glottalised clicks are clearly voiceless due to the hold before the release, and they are transcribed as simple voiceless clicks in the traditional orthography. The nasal component is not audible in initial position; the voiceless nasal component of the aspirated clicks is also difficult to hear when not between vowels, so to foreign ears, it may sound like a longer but less raspy version of the contour clicks.\n\nTindall notes that European learners almost invariably pronounce the lateral clicks by placing the tongue against the side teeth and that this articulation is \"harsh and foreign to the native ear\". The Namaqua instead cover the whole of the palate with the tongue and produce the sound \"as far back in the palate as possible\".\n\nLexical root words consist of two or rarely three moras, in the form CVCV(C), CVV(C), or CVN(C). (The initial consonant is required.) The middle consonant may only be \"w r m n\" (\"w\" is \"b~p\" and \"r\" is \"d~t\"), while the final consonant (C) may only be \"p, s, ts\". Each mora carries tone, but the second may only be high or medium, for six tone \"melodies\": HH, MH, LH, HM, MM, LM.\n\nOral vowel sequences in CVV are . Due to the reduced number of nasal vowels, nasal sequences are . Sequences ending in a high vowel () are pronounced more quickly than others (), more like diphthongs and long vowels than like vowel sequences in hiatus. The tones are realised as contours. CVCV words tend to have the same vowel sequences, though there are many exceptions. The two tones are also more distinct.\n\nVowel-nasal sequences are restricted to non-front vowels: . Their tones are also realised as contours.\n\nGrammatical particles have the form CV or CN, with any vowel or tone, where C may be any consonant but a click, and the latter cannot be NN. Suffixes and a third mora of a root, may have the form CV, CN, V, N, with any vowel or tone; there are also three C-only suffixes, \"-p\" 1m.sg, \"-ts\" 2m.sg, \"-s\" 2/3f.sg.\n\nThere have been several orthographies used for Nama. \"A Khoekhoegowab dictionary\" (Haacke 2000) uses the modern standard.\n\nIn standard orthography, the consonants \"b d g\" are used for words with one of the lower tone melodies and \"p t k\" for one of the higher tone melodies. \"W\" is only used between vowels, though it may be replaced with \"b\" or \"p\" according to melody. Overt tone marking is otherwise generally omitted.\n\nNasal vowels are written with a circumflex. All nasal vowels are long, as in \"hû\" 'seven'.

He is the author of the multi-awarded Filipino novel \"Orosa-Nakpil, Malate\" and is currently working as a clinical research associate for the Hawaii Center for AIDS.\n\nGangcuangco was born on March 26, 1987 in Mandaluyong City, Philippines. He finished his primary education in Montessori de San Juan (MSJ) as the batch valedictorian in 1999. He represented MSJ in several competitions, most notably the Walt Disney Interschool Leadership Competition in which he was second runner-up.\n\nHe was a junior reporter for the morning television show, \"Alas Singko y Medya\" (ABS-CBN) from 1997 to 2000 where he featured pertinent issues affecting children and interviewed celebrities, including the international pop singer, Aaron Carter. He graduated from Manila Science High School (Masci) in 2003 as the First Honorable Mention, First Meritorious Awardee, Best in English, and Best in Filipino. He has represented Masci in several interschool competitions, including the Philippine National Inventors' Contest; Children’s Museum and Library Incorporated Impromptu Speech Contest (second place); and The Philippine National Police Impromptu Speaking Contest (third place). He was the Science editor of \"The Nucleus\", the school publication of Masci, awarded as the third best school paper in the Philippines during his editorship.\n\nGangcuangco was two years accelerated in college under the Integrated Liberal Arts and Medicine (Intarmed) curriculum of the UP College of Medicine at the University of the Philippines Manila. He had his elective clerkship in Infectious Diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine in UCLA in 2008 where he received an 'A' performance rating. He trained under the Straight Internal Medicine Internship program of the Philippine General Hospital from June 2009 to April 2010. Gangcuangco received his BS in Basic Medical Sciences degree in 2007 and Doctor of Medicine degree from the UP College of Medicine in May 2010 with the prestigious distinction of being the Most Outstanding Student in Research.\n\nGangcuangco's interests in infectious diseases inspired him at 18 years old, to write the novel, Orosa-Nakpil, Malate, which was published in March 2006. It is an anthropologic exposition of the mechanics of HIV transmission in the Philippine's gay district of Malate, Manila.\n\n\"Orosa-Nakpil\" is critically acclaimed for promoting HIV and AIDS awareness. It was featured in the top-rating show Sharon (talk show) in June 2006 and was also aired internationally through The Filipino Channel. In August 2006, Gangcuangco was awarded the \"Y Idol Award\" (Youth Idol Award) by Studio 23’s Y Speak. Later that month, the Sentro ng Wikang Filipino conferred a Sertipiko ng Pagpapahalaga for \"Orosa-Nakpil, Malate\". His novel is endorsed by prominent people and institutions including the multi-awarded director, José Javier Reyes, Jaime Galvez Tan (former Department of Health secretary) and Dr. Raul Destura of the National Institutes of Health Philippines.\n\n\"Orosa-Nakpil, Malate\" became a National Book Store Best Seller in April 2007, making Gangcuangco one of the youngest best-selling authors in the Philippines. With him in the list were Mitchell David \"Mitch\" Albom of One More Day, James Patterson and Maxine Paetro of The 5th Horseman, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Memories of My Melancholy Whores. The book landed on the Top 8 spot, overtaking international authors Steve Berry and Kiran Desai.\n\n\"Orosa-Nakpil, Malate\", has been featured in several publications, including the Generation Pink Magazine’s \"The Great Escape\" Issue; \"The Flame\": The Official Liberal Journal of the Humanities of the University of Sto. Tomas; Icon Magazine’s Career Issue; \"The Manila Collegian\", The Nightmare Before Christmas Issue; and The Philippine Star’s \"My Favorite Book\", Sunday Lifestyle.\n\nIn 2008, Gangcuangco published his second book, \"Gee, My Grades Are Terrific: A Student’s Guide to Academic Excellence\", a self-help book for students. The English version of \"Orosa-Nakpil, Malate\" was released in September 2009 and the second edition of \"Gee My Grades Are Terrific\" was published in August 2011. Gangcuangco is considered one of the most influential authors of the Philippines.\n\nGangcuangco has served as a guest speaker for several universities in the Philippines, including the University of the Philippines Manila, University of the Philippines Diliman, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, San Beda College, Philippine Normal University, and the American Chamber Foundation Philippines. He has delivered lectures on various topics including: homosexuality, HIV-AIDS, and gay literature in the Philippines.\n\nIn 2010, Gangcuangco headed one of the largest HIV testing projects among men having sex with men in Metro Manila. The findings were presented at the XVIII International AIDS Conference in Vienna, Austria and was published at the Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health. The study entitled, \"Prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection among men having sex with men in Metro Manila, Philippines,\" stirred national debate and attracted media attention because of the high HIV infection rate found among the participants.\nIn December 2011, Gangcuangco left his positions as faculty member of the San Beda College of Medicine and the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health to pursue HIV research fellowship at the Nagasaki Institute of Tropical Medicine. He is currently a clinical research associate at the Hawaii Center for AIDS. His research projects are focused on the cardio-metabolic complications of HIV and aging, neuro-cognitive dysfunction, and inflammation. Gangcuangco then pursued further training in Internal Medicine at a Yale-affiliated hospital in Connecticut.\n\nGangcuangco is an associate member of the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, International AIDS Society, and the American College of Physicians.\n\n"}

Essentially it is a heavily Frenchified Brabant-Dutch dialect additionally incorporating a sprinkle of Spanish dating back to the rule of the Low Countries by the Habsburgs (1519-1713). Its name refers to a district of Brussels called Marollen (Marolles), a neighborhood in the south-central municipality of Brussels, not far from the Palace of Justice. The district takes its name from the former abbey of the nuns Maria Colentes (\"Marikollen\"). It was a working-class neighborhood, though now it has become a fashionable part of the city. Marols is described as \"totally indecipherable to the foreigner (which covers everyone not born in the Marolles) which is probably a good thing as it is richly abusive.\"\n\nThe Théâtre Royal de Toone in Brussels puts on puppet and plays in Marols.\n\nThere is a dispute and confusion about the meaning of Marols, which many consider to be a neighborhood jargon distinct from a larger Brussels Dutch dialect, while others use the term \"Marols\" as an overarching substitute term for that citywide dialect. According to Jeanine Treffers-Daller, “the dialect has a tremendous prestige and a lot of myths are doing the rounds.”\n\nAn example of Marols is:\n\nFor the popular comic series \"The Adventures of Tintin\", the Belgian author Hergé modeled his fictional languages Syldavian and Bordurian on Marols, and modeled many other personal and place-names in his works on the dialect (e.g. the city of Khemkhâh in the fictional Middle Eastern country of Khemed comes from the Marols phrase for \"I'm cold\"). Bordurian, for example, has as one of its words the Marols-based \"mänhir\", meaning \"mister\" (cf. Dutch \"mijnheer\"). In the original French, the fictional Arumbaya language of San Theodoros is another incarnation of Marols.\n"}

Some materials may be considered as combinations of the two. Certain veneers which are composed of images printed on plastic are a good example of this. Observationally therefore, virtual materials can be said not to exist without a natural physical substrate.

Both use a large neural network with the difference that deep neural machine translation processes multiple neural network layers instead of just one.\n\nThey require only a fraction of the memory needed by traditional statistical machine translation (SMT) models. Furthermore, unlike conventional translation systems, all parts of the neural translation model are trained jointly (end-to-end) to maximize the translation performance.\n\nDeep learning applications appeared first in speech recognition in the 1990s. The first scientific paper on using neural networks in machine translation appeared in 2014, followed by a lot of advances in the following few years. (Large-vocabulary NMT, application to Image captioning, Subword-NMT, Multilingual NMT, Multi-Source NMT, Character-dec NMT, Zero-Resource NMT, Google, Fully Character-NMT, Zero-Shot NMT in 2017) In 2015 there was the first appearance of a NMT system in a public machine translation competition (OpenMT'15). WMT'15 also for the first time had a NMT contender; the following year it already had 90% of NMT systems among its winners.\n\nNMT departs from phrase-based statistical approaches that use separately engineered subcomponents. Neural machine translation (NMT) is not a drastic step beyond what has been traditionally done in statistical machine translation (SMT). Its main departure is the use of vector representations (\"embeddings\", \"continuous space representations\") for words and internal states. The structure of the models is simpler than phrase-based models. There is no separate language model, translation model, and reordering model, but just a single sequence model that predicts one word at a time. However, this sequence prediction is conditioned on the entire source sentence and the entire already produced target sequence.\n\nNMT models use deep learning and representation learning.\n\nThe word sequence modeling was at first typically done using a recurrent neural network (RNN).\nA bidirectional recurrent neural network, known as an \"encoder\", is used by the neural network to encode a source sentence for a second RNN, known as a \"decoder\", that is used to predict words in the target language.\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks (Convnets) are in principle somewhat better for long continuous sequences, but were initially not used due to several weaknesses that were successfully compensated for by 2017 by using so-called \"attention\"-based approaches.\n\nBy 2016, most of the best MT systems were using neural networks.\nGoogle, Microsoft and Yandex translation services now use NMT. Google uses Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) in preference to its previous statistical methods. Microsoft uses a similar technology for its speech translations (including Microsoft Translator live and Skype Translator). An open source neural machine translation system, OpenNMT, has been released by the Harvard NLP group. Yandex.Translator has a hybrid model: its translation provides a statistical model and a neural network. After this, the algorithm CatBoost, which is based on machine learning, will select the best of the obtained results Machine translation providers who also offer neural machine translation include Pangeanic's language lab PangeaMT , Omniscien Technologies (formerly Asia Online), Tilde, KantanMT, SDL, Globalese, and TransPerfect.

They may be numbered consecutively in the score, and may be interspersed with recitative or spoken dialogue. Opera numbers may be arias, but also ensemble pieces, such as duets, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets or choruses. They may also be ballets and instrumental pieces, such as marches, sinfonias, or intermezzi. The number opera format was standard until the mid-19th century and most opera genres, including \"opera seria\", \"opera buffa\", \"opéra comique\", ballad opera, Singspiel, and grand opera, were constructed in this fashion.\n\nThe replacement of numbers with more continuous music began in operas by Jommelli, Traetta, Gluck, and especially Mozart, whose late operas \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" and \"Don Giovanni\" contain several segments in which different numbers are unified by bridge passages to form a musical whole. This trend became even more striking in the operas of the German composers Beethoven, Weber, and Meyerbeer, while their Italian and French contemporaries Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Auber retained the number opera style.\n\nThe number opera was strongly condemned by Wagner for dramatic reasons, and he replaced it with continuous music that advances the drama without interruption. The number opera became unfashionable, and the late operas of Verdi and those of Puccini and the \"verismo\" school, cannot be described as such.\n\nMany operatic composers subsequent to Wagner adopted his approach. However, in the 20th century some composers intentionally revived or adapted the number opera format, e. g., Busoni's \"Arlecchino\" (1917), Berg's \"Wozzeck\" (1925), Hindemith's \"Cardillac\" (1926, rev. 1952), and Stravinsky's \"The Rake's Progress\" (1951).

{"id": "35046168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35046168", "title": "Openwork", "text": "Openwork\n\nOpenwork or open-work is a term in art history, architecture and related fields for any technique that produces decoration by creating holes, piercings, or gaps that go right through a solid material such as metal, wood, stone, pottery, cloth, leather, or ivory. Such techniques have been very widely used in a great number of cultures.\n\nThe term is rather flexible, and used both for additive techniques that build up the design, as for example most large features in architecture, and those that take a plain material and make cuts or holes in it. Equally techniques such as casting using moulds create the whole design in a single stage, and are common in openwork. Though much openwork relies for its effect on the viewer seeing right through the object, some pieces place a different material behind the openwork as a background.\n\nTechniques or styles that normally use openwork include all the family of lace and cutwork types in textiles, including broderie anglaise and many others. Fretwork in wood is used for various types of objects. There has always been great use of openwork in jewellery, not least to save on expensive materials and weight. For example, opus interrasile is a type of decoration used in Ancient Roman and Byzantine jewellery, piercing thin strips of gold with punches. Other techniques used casting with moulds, or built up the design with wire or small strips of metal. Essentially flat objects are straightforward to cast using moulds of clay or other materials, and this technique was known in ancient China since before the Shang Dynasty of c. 1600 to 1046 BC. On a larger scale in metal, wrought iron and cast iron decoration more often than not has involved openwork.\n\nScythian metalwork, which was typically worn on the person, or at least carried about by wagon, uses openwork heavily, probably partly to save weight. Sukashibori (roughly translating to \"see-through work\") is the Japanese term covering a number of openwork techniques, which have been very popular in Japanese art.\n\nIn ceramics, if objects such as sieves are excluded (openwork bases for these existed in the West from classical times), decorative openwork long remained mainly a feature of East Asian ceramics, with Korean ceramics especially fond of the technique from an early date. There was little use of it in European ceramics before the 18th century, when designs, mostly using lattice panels, were popular in rococo ceramic \"baskets\", and later in English silver trays. Openwork sections can be made either by cutting into a conventional solid body before firing, or by building up using strips of clay, the latter often used when loose wickerwork is being imitated. In glass openwork is rather less common, but the spectacular Ancient Roman cage cups use it for a decorative outer layer.\n\nSome types of objects naturally suit or even require openwork, which allows a flow of air through screens, censers or incense burners, pomanders, sprinklers, ventilation grilles and panels, and various parts of heating systems. For exterior screens openwork designs allow looking out, but not looking in. For gates and other types of screens, security is required, but visibility may also be wanted.\n\nIn architecture openwork takes many forms, including tracery, balustrades and parapets, as well as screens of many kinds. A variety of screen types especially common in the Islamic world include stone jali and equivalents in wood such as mashrabiya. Belfries and bell-towers normally include open or semi-open elements to allow the sound to be heard at distance, and these are often turned to decorative use. In Gothic architecture some entire spires are openwork. The later of the two spires on the West Front of Chartres Cathedral is very largely openwork. As well as stone and wood the range of materials includes brick, which may be used for windows, normally unglazed, and screens. Constructions such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris are also described as openwork. Here an openwork structure was crucial for the engineering, reducing not only weight but wind resistance.\n\nBeginning with the early fourteenth-century spire at Freiburg Minster, in which the pierced stonework was held together by iron cramps, the openwork spire, according to Robert Bork, represents a \"radical but logical extension of the Gothic tendency towards skeletal structure.\" The 18 openwork spires of Antoni Gaudi's Sagrada Família in Barcelona represent an outgrowth of this Gothic tendency. Designed and begun by Gaudi in 1884, they remained incomplete into the 21st century.\n\n"}

Less common are preachers who preach on the street, or those whose message is not necessarily religious, but who preach components such as a moral or social worldview or philosophy.\n\nPreachers are common throughout most cultures. They can take the form of a Christian minister on a Sunday morning, or an Islamic Imam. A Muslim preacher in general is referred to as a \"dā‘ī\", while one giving sermons on a Friday afternoon is called a \"khatib\". \n\nThe sermon or homily has been an important part of Christian services since Early Christianity, and remains prominent in both Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Lay preachers sometimes figure in these traditions of worship, for example the Methodist local preachers, but in general preaching has usually been a function of the clergy. The Dominican Order is officially known as the \"Order of Preachers\" (\"Ordo Praedicatorum\" in Latin); friars of this order were trained to publicly preach in vernacular languages, and the order was created by Saint Dominic to preach to the Cathars of southern France in the early thirteenth century. The Franciscans are another important preaching order; Travelling preachers, usually friars, were an important feature of late medieval Catholicism.\n\nIn most denominations, modern preaching is kept below about 40 minutes, but historic preachers of all denominations could at times speak for well over an hour, sometimes for two or three hours, and use techniques of rhetoric and theatre that are today somewhat out of fashion in mainline churches. \n\nIn many churches in the United States, the title \"Preacher\" is synonymous with \"pastor\" or \"minister\", and the church's minister is often referred to simply as \"our/the preacher\" or by name such as \"Preacher Smith\". However, among some Chinese churches, preacher (Chinese: 傳道) is different from pastor (Chinese: 牧師). A preacher in the Protestant church is one of the younger clergy, but they are not officially recognised as pastors until they can prove their capability of leading the church.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1497885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1497885", "title": "Western Neo-Aramaic", "text": "Western Neo-Aramaic\n\nWestern Neo-Aramaic is a modern Aramaic language. Today, it is spoken in three villages in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains of western Syria. Western Neo-Aramaic is the only living language among the Western Aramaic languages. All other Neo-Aramaic languages are of the Eastern Aramaic branch.\n\nWestern Neo-Aramaic is probably the last surviving remnant of a Western Middle Aramaic dialect which was spoken throughout the Orontes River Valley area and into the Anti-Lebanon Mountains in the 6th century. It now is spoken solely by the villagers of Maaloula, Jubb'adin and Bakh'a, about northeast of Damascus. The continuation of this little cluster of Aramaic in a sea of Arabic is partly due to the relative isolation of the villages and their close-knit Christian communities.\n\nFollowing the Muslim conquest of the Levant, there was a linguistic shift to Arabic for local Muslims and later for remaining Christians; Arabic displaced various Aramaic languages, including Western Aramaic varieties, as the first language of the majority. Despite this, Western Aramaic appears to have survived for a relatively long time at least in some villages in mountainous areas of Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon (in modern Syria). In fact, up until the 17th century, travellers in the Lebanon still reported on several Aramaic-speaking villages.\n\nIn the last three villages where the language still survives, the dialect of Bakh'a appears to be the most conservative. It has been less influenced by Arabic than the other dialects, and retains some vocabulary that is obsolete in other dialects. The dialect of Jubb'adin has changed the most. It is heavily influenced by Arabic, and has a more developed phonology. The dialect of Maaloula is somewhere between the two, but is closer to that of Jubb'adin. Cross-linguistic influence between Aramaic and Arabic has been mutual, as Syrian Arabic itself (and Levantine Arabic in general) retains an Aramaic substratum.\n\nAs in most of the Levant prior to the introduction of Islam in the seventh century, the villages were originally all Christian. However, Maaloula is the only village that retains a sizeable Christian population (they mostly belong to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church) as most of the inhabitants of Bakh'a and Jubb Adin adopted Islam over the generations, and are now all Muslim. Maaloula glows in the pale blue wash with which houses are painted every year in honour of Mary, mother of Jesus.\n\nAll three remaining Western Neo-Aramaic dialects are facing critical endangerment as living languages. As with any village community in the 21st century, young residents are migrating into major cities like Damascus and Aleppo in search of better employment opportunities, thus forcing them into monolingual Arabic-speaking settings, in turn straining the opportunity to actively maintain Western Neo-Aramaic as a language of daily use. Nevertheless, the Syrian government provides support for teaching the language. Since 2007, Maaloula has been home to an Aramaic institute established by the Damascus University that teaches courses to keep the language alive. The institute's activities were suspended in 2010 amidst fears that the square Aramaic alphabet used in the program too closely resembled the square script of the Hebrew alphabet and all the signs with the square Aramaic script were taken down. The program stated that they would instead use the more distinct Syriac alphabet, although use of the Aramaic alphabet has continued to some degree. Al Jazeera Arabic also broadcast a program about Western Neo-Aramaic and the villages in which it is spoken with the square script still in use.\n\nIn December 2016 during an Aramaic Singing Festival in Maaloula, a modified version of an older style of the Aramaic alphabet closer to the Phoenician alphabet was used for Western Neo-Aramaic. This script seems to be used as a true alphabet with letters to represent both consonants and vowels instead of the traditional system of the Aramaic alphabet where it's used as an abjad. A recently published book about Maaloula Aramaic also uses this script.\n\nThe Syriac language organization Rinyo has published the Book of Psalms from the Old Testament in writing and the book \"Portrait of Jesus\" in writing with audio in Aromay in the Syriac Serto script on their website and a translation of the New Testament into Aromay has been finished in 2017 and is now available online.<ref name=\"New Testament in Western Neo-Aramaic (Serto/Arabic)\">https://scriptureearth.org/data/amw/PDF/amwMaLuliNT-web.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2017 a free course in Western Neo-Aramaic started at Damascus University.\n\nThe phonology of Western Neo-Aramaic has developed quite differently from other Aramaic languages. The labial consonants of older Western Aramaic, and , have been retained in Bakh'a and Maaloula while they have mostly collapsed to in Jubb'adin under influence from Arabic. The labial consonant pair has collapsed to in all three villages. Amongst dental consonants, the fricatives are retained while have become in most places and , while remaining a phoneme, has had its traditional position in Aramaic words replaced by in Bakh'a, and in Maaloula and Jubb'adin. However, is the usual form for the relative particle in these two villages, with a variant , where Bakh'a always uses . Among the velar consonants, the traditional voiced pair of has collapsed into , while /ɡ/ still remains a phoneme in some words. The unvoiced velar fricative, , is retained, but its plosive complement , while also remaining a distinct phoneme, has in its traditional positions in Aramaic words started to undergo palatalization. In Bakh'a, the palatalization is hardly apparent; in Maaloula, it is more obvious, and often leads to ; in Jubb'adin, it has become , and has thus merged phonemically with the original positions of . The original uvular plosive, , has also moved forward in Western Neo-Aramaic. In Bakh'a it has become a strongly post-velar plosive, and in Maaloula more lightly post-velar. In Jubb'adin, however, it has replaced the velar plosive, and become .\n\nWestern Neo-Aramaic has the following set of vowels:\n\nSquare Aramaic Alphabet used for Aromay/Western Neo-Aramaic. Words beginning with a vowel are written with an initial . Short vowels are omitted or written with diacritics, long vowels are transcribed with macrons (Āā, Ēē, Īī, Ōō, Ūū) and are written with mater lectionis ( for /o/ and /u/, for /i/, which are also used at the end of a word if it ends with one of these vowels and if a word begins with any of these long wovels, they begin with + the mater lectionis). Words ending with /a/ are written with at the end of the word, while words ending with /e/ are written with at the end.
