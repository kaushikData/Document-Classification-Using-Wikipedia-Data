It is termed a \"salute\" because the upward movement of the hand acts as an unintentional gesture. The habit of using the hand to wipe the nose is observed more often in children but is common in adults as well. Saluting most commonly temporarily relieves nasal itching as well as removing small amounts of nasal mucus.\n\nIn people who are experiencing seizures, nose wiping has been observed as a semivoluntary action.\n\nThe upwards wiping of the nose and nostrils allows for running mucus to be wiped off quickly and easily. Also, as the nostrils are being pushed up the air passages through the nose become temporarily propped open. This is especially beneficial if the air passages are swollen and the nostrils are itchy due to irritations such as allergic rhinitis.\n\nThe mucus that is wiped onto the hand will most likely carry bacteria and other germs which could then in turn be passed along to other people. Habitual as well as fast or rough saluting may also result in a crease (known as a transverse nasal crease or groove) running across the nose, and can lead to permanent physical deformity observable in childhood and adulthood.\n\n"}

{"id": "27990810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27990810", "title": "Covenant (religion)", "text": "Covenant (religion)\n\nIn religion, a covenant is a formal alliance or agreement made by God with a religious community or with humanity in general. It is central to the Abrahamic religions and derived from the biblical covenants, notably the Abrahamic covenant.\n\nA covenant in its most general sense and historical sense, is a solemn promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action. A covenant is a type of agreement analogous to a contractual condition. The covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (negative covenant).\n\nCovenant is the customary word used to translate the Hebrew word \"berith\". It is used in the Masoretic Text 264 times. The equivalent word in the Septuagint and the Greek New Testament is , \"diatheke\".\n\nThe Mosaic covenant refers to a biblical covenant between God and the biblical Israelites. The establishment and stipulations of the Mosaic covenant are recorded in the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, which are traditionally attributed to Mosaic authorship and collectively called the Torah, and this covenant is sometimes also referred to as the Law of Moses or Mosaic Law or the 613 Mitzvot.\n\nCovenants are often initiated by an oath and can be of two types: grants or treaties. Grants are generally unilateral, unconditional covenants such as those where God made unconditional promises to Noah (Genesis 9), Abraham (Genesis 15, Genesis 17) and David (2 Samuel 7:8ff). Bilateral covenants are generally conditional with blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience as in Deuteronomy 28 and 30. \n\nBiblical theology and systematic theology for covenants often intertwines the unilateral and the bilateral, the conditional and the unconditional, such that much has been written and said about \"Old\" and \"New\" Covenants and the extent to which the \"Old Covenant\" still persists. The typology of covenants is governed by the distribution of covenant obligations between the covenanting parties.\n\nThe New Covenant is a biblical interpretation originally derived from a phrase in the Book of Jeremiah, in the Hebrew Bible. Generally, Christians believe that the New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper as part of the Eucharist, which in the Gospel of John includes the New Commandment.\n\nThere are several Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant. For example, an inaugurated eschatology defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ; that is, it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts, but in the future external world as well. The connection between the blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament with the saying: \"this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood\".\n\nChristians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and that the blood of Christ shed at his crucifixion is the required blood of the covenant. As with all covenants between God and man described in the Bible, the New Covenant is considered \"a bond in blood sovereignly administered by God.\" It has been theorized that the New Covenant is the Law of Christ as spoken during his Sermon on the Mount.\n\nCovenant theology, a theological system within Reformed Christianity, holds that God relates to man primarily through three covenants: the Covenant of Redemption, the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace. In this theological system a covenant may be defined as, \"an unchangeable, divinely imposed legal agreement between God and man that stipulates the conditions of their relationship.\"\n\nIn the Latter Day Saint movement, a covenant is a promise made between God and a person or a group of people. God sets the conditions of the covenant, and as the conditions are met, he blesses the person who entered into and kept the covenant. If the covenant is violated, blessings are withheld and in some cases a penalty or punishment is inflicted.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that one enters a covenant through a ritual or a visible sign. Some leaders have taught that a covenant is always associated with an ordinance. Other leaders have suggested that commandments that include promised blessings for compliance—such as the law of tithing and Word of Wisdom—also constitute covenants.\n\nIn the LDS Church, ordinances which are accompanied by covenants include baptism and confirmation; partaking of the sacrament; reception of the Melchizedek priesthood; the temple endowment; and celestial marriage. These are known as \"saving ordinances\" and are a requirement for exaltation.\n\nOfficially, partaking of the sacrament is considered by the LDS Church to be a renewal of the covenants made at baptism; however, some Latter-day Saint leaders have taught that doing so constitutes a renewal of all covenants a person has made.\n\nThe original covenant made between God and mankind marked the beginning of creation according to Islamic theology. It is believed that before the creation of the heavens and the earth, God assembled all of creation (that would ever exist) in a timeless, placeless region and informed them of the truth of his existence. This moment is referred to in the verse 7:172 of the Quran as follows: \nThis covenant is significant in that it asserts that an understanding of the origin of man is something deeply inherent to and natural within every person. Any disconnection from this memory is referred to as being ‘forgetful’ within the scripture, \"hadith\" literature and commentary. The Quran constantly implores people to recall and remember. Scholars suggest that the call to remember throughout the Quran is in fact a call to remember this particular moment in their spiritual history. Suggestions are also made that where people recognise people with ease, it is usually as a memory from this event. To strive to remember through invocations and contemplation is thus considered a form of worship in Islam called \"dhikr\".\n\nThere are many scholarly perspectives taken on the significance of this covenant. It is understood as marking the beginning of human consciousness with mankind making their first conscious response to the divine question 'Am I not your lord?'. Some also see it as being relevant to the Islamic principle of \"Tawhid\" or unity as the entirety of mankind was said to have been assembled on the plane on this date.\n\nAnother perspective is that as an Abrahamic faith, the covenant was made with Abraham. Any person confessing to faith can become a Muslim and partake of this covenant with God: \nGerhard Bowering has written about the mystical aspects of the Covenant in Islam.\n\nIn Indo-Iranian religious tradition, Mithra-Mitra is the hypostasis of covenant, and hence keeper and protector of moral, social and interpersonal relationships, including love and friendship. In living Zoroastrianism, which is one of the two primary developments of Indo-Iranian religious tradition, Mithra is by extension a judge, protecting agreements by ensuring that individuals who break one do not enter Heaven.\n\n"}
{"id": "505730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505730", "title": "Cultural assimilation", "text": "Cultural assimilation\n\nCultural assimilation is the process in which a minority group or culture comes to resemble those of a dominant group. The term is used to refer to both individuals and groups; the latter case can refer to a range of social groups, including ethnic minorities, immigrants, indigenous peoples, and other marginalized groups such as sexual minorities who adapt to being culturally dominated by another societal group.\n\nCultural assimilation may involve either a quick or a gradual change depending on circumstances of the group. Full assimilation occurs when members of a society become indistinguishable from those of the dominant group. \n\nWhether it is desirable for a given group to assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and those of the dominant society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social alikeness.\n\nthough as this article states, geographical and other natural barriers between cultures even if started by the same dominant culture will be culturally different.\n\nA place, state, or ethnicity can spontaneously adopt a different culture because of its political relevance or its perceived cultural superiority. An example is the Latin language and Roman culture being gradually adopted by most of the people subjugated by Ancient Rome.\n\nCultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly (\"see forced assimilation\"). A culture can spontaneously adopt a different culture. Also, older, richer, or otherwise more dominant cultures can forcibly absorb subordinate cultures.\n\nThe term assimilation is often used with regard to not only indigenous groups but also immigrants settled in a new land. A new culture and new attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication. Assimilation assumes that a relatively-tenuous culture gets to be united to one unified culture. That process happens by contact and accommodation between each culture. The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants, but in multiculturalism, cultural assimilation can happen all over the world and within varying social contexts and is not limited to specific areas. For example, a shared language gives people the chance to study and work internationally, without being limited to the same cultural group. People from different countries contribute to diversity and form the \"global culture\" which means the culture combined by the elements from different countries. That \"global culture\" can be seen as a part of assimilation, which causes cultures from different areas to affect one another.\n\nImmigrant assimilation is a complex process in which immigrants not only fully integrate themselves into a new country but also lose aspects, perhaps even all of their heritage. Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: socioeconomic status, geographic distribution, second language attainment, and intermarriage. William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation as \"a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and minority groups.\"\n\nBetween 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million immigrants. This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. The beginning of the 21st century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impacts that immigration has on society and on the on immigrants themselves.\n\nAssimilation had various meanings in American sociology. Henry Pratt Fairchild associates American assimilation with Americanization or the \"melting pot\" theory. Some scholars also believed that assimilation and acculturation were synonymous. According to a common point of view, assimilation is a \"process of interpretation and fusion\" from another group or person. That may include memories, behaviors and sentiments. By sharing their experiences and histories, they blend into the common cultural life.\n\nThe long history of immigration in the established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies in the traditional gateways are more structured or established, but on the other hand, the new gateways do not have much immigration history and so the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies is less defined, and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of racial segregation among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, social organizations. Finally, Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that those differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers that should assess immigrant assimilation.\n\nCulture-specific:\n\n"}

In turn, Professor Bloch considered the level of language units that had gone unnoticed, namely the levels of the phoneme and morpheme, to which he added the \"third integral level of constructions with blurred boundaries\" – syntax. Thus, following the creation of morphology by Dionysius Thrax and syntax by Apollonius Dyscolus, the isolation of the dictema represents another key stage in the history of grammar.\n\nIn a uniformly unfolding monologic written text, the dictema is usually represented by a paragraph, whereas in dialogical speech, the dictemma is usually represented by a rejoinder. \n\nAs an integrative unit of linguistic expression, the dictema distinguishes four main functionally significant aspects: naming, predication, thematization and stylization.\n\n"}

It was originally simply used to describe the \"ego boost\" someone feels on seeing their name in print. As a reliable way for someone to get their name in print was to do something worth mentioning, it became caught up with the idea of voluntary community participation. As a result of this, in later years, the term grew to mean something akin to an ephemeral currency, e.g., \"I got a lot of egoboo for editing that newsletter.\"\n\nThe term later spread into the open source programming movement, where the concept of non-monetary reward from community response is a key motivator for many of the participants.\n\nAs a result of its prevalence in this context, it is often attributed to Eric S. Raymond. However, it has been in use in science fiction fandom since 1947 or earlier, being referenced in the 1959 collection of fandom-related jargon \"Fancyclopedia II\". It did not, however, occur in the 1944 predecessor to that work, \"Fancyclopedia I\", suggesting the term came into common use sometime in the intervening years. The first print citation available electronically is in a 1950 issue of Lee Hoffman's \"Quandry\", where it is spelled \"ego-boo\"; later usage dropped the hyphen and blended the two words, a common feature of fannish jargon.\n\nThe earliest online citation recorded is a reference to it being used in 1982, describing InConJunction, a science fiction convention in Indiana; the high proportion of science fiction fans on Usenet, and the Internet generally, in early years no doubt helped spread it into the wider computing community.\n\n"}

R. R. Tolkien created many languages for his Elves, which eventuated in the creation of a mythology (expounded in his books), complete with races, to speak the languages he had constructed. The language has quickly spread among modern day use, resulting in Quenya and Sindarin to become legally stated languages. His interest was primarily philological, and he said his stories grew out of his languages. The languages were the first thing Tolkien created for his mythos, starting with what he originally called \"Qenya\", the first primitive form of Elvish. This was later called Quenya (High-elven) and is one of the two most complete of Tolkien's languages (the other being Sindarin, or Grey-elven). The phonology and grammar of Quenya are strongly influenced by Finnish, Latin, Greek and elements of ancient Germanic languages, and Sindarin is strongly influenced by Welsh.\n\nTolkien conceived a family tree of Elvish languages, all descending from a common ancestor called Primitive Quendian. He worked extensively on how the languages diverged from Primitive Quendian over time, in phonology and grammar, in imitation of the development of real language families. In addition to Quenya and Sindarin, he sketched several other Elvish languages in far less detail, such as Telerin, Nandorin, and Avarin.\n\nIn addition to Tolkien's original lexicon, many fans have contributed words and phrases, attempting to create a language that can be fully used in reality.\n\nSince Tolkien, others have invented Elvish languages in their own fiction. Several borrow sounds and forms (or even whole words) from Tolkien's Elvish languages, especially Quenya, while others are quite distinct.\n\n\n"}

According to Michel Foucault, \"The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation.\nThey also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace).\"\n\nMichel Foucault uses the word in the sense of \"note\", but his translators use the word \"notebook\", which is anachronistic (see codex and wax tablet). Concerning Seneca's discipline of self-knowledge, Foucault writes: \"In this period there was a culture of what could be called personal writing: taking notes on the reading, conversations, and reflections that one hears or engages in oneself; keeping kinds of notebooks on important subjects (what the Greeks call 'hupomnemata'), which must be reread from time to time so as to reactualize their contents.\" In an excerpt from an \"Interview with Michel Foucault\" in \"The Foucault Reader\", he says: \"As personal as they were, the hypomnemata must nevertheless not be taken for intimate diaries or for those accounts of spiritual experience (temptations, struggles, falls, and victories) which can be found in later Christian literature.

Irish Sign Language is more closely related to French Sign Language (LSF) than to BSL, though it has influence from both languages. It has influenced sign languages in Australia and South Africa, and has little relation to either spoken Irish or English.\n\nThe Irish Deaf Society says that ISL \"arose from within deaf communities\", \"was developed by deaf people themselves\" and \"has been in existence for hundreds of years\". According to Ethnologue, the language has influence from both LSF and BSL, as well as from signed French and signed English, BSL having been introduced in Dublin in 1816. The first school for deaf children in Ireland was established in 1816 by Dr. Charles Orpen. The Claremont Institute was a Protestant institution and given that Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom, it is no surprise that BSL (or some version of signed English based in BSL) was used for teaching and learning (Pollard 2006). McDonnell (1979) reports that the Irish institutions - Catholic and Protestant - did not teach the children to speak and it was not until 1887 that Claremont report changing from a manual to an oral approach. For the Catholic schools, the shift to oralism came later: St. Mary's School for Deaf Girls moved to an oral approach in 1946 and St. Joseph's School for Deaf Boys shifted to oralism in 1956, though this did not become formal state policy until 1972. Sign language use was seriously suppressed and religion was used to further stigmatise the language (e.g. children were encouraged to give up signing for Lent and sent to confession if caught signing). The fact that the Catholic schools are segregated on the basis of gender led to the development of a gendered-generational variant of Irish Sign Language that is still evident (albeit to a lesser degree) today.\n\nISL was brought by Catholic missionaries to Australia,and to Scotland and England, with remnants of ISL still visible in some variants of BSL, especially in Glasgow, and with some elderly Auslan Catholics still using ISL today. In South Africa, the Dominican nuns who established Catholic Schools saw a need for a school for the deaf, but due to resource constraints were not in a position to do this immediately. Instead, they wrote back to their Mother House in Cabra requesting an experienced teacher of the deaf. A deaf teacher, Ms. Bridget Lynne, responded. Remnants of gendered generational Irish Sign Language are thought to still be visible in some dialects of South African Sign Language, which can probably be traced back to Ms. Lynne. \n\nThe \"Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016\" passed all stages in the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) on 14 December 2017, and was signed into law by the President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on 24 December 2017. The Bill ensures that public services are available through ISL and also outlines the need for greater access to education through sign language. Prior to the passage, there was no automatic right for deaf people to have an ISL interpreter (except for criminal court proceedings). For the deaf community, recognition of ISL means more legal rights and better access to public services - including education, healthcare, media and banking.\n\nThe ISO 639-3 code for Irish Sign Language is 'isg'; 'isl' is the code for Icelandic.\n\n\n\n"}

The Kaingang nation has about 30,000  people, and about from 60% to 65% speak the language. Most also speak Portuguese.\n\nThe Kaingang and Xokleng were previously considered a single ethnicity, which went by a number of names, including \"Amhó, Dorin, Gualachi, Chiqui, Ingain, Botocudo, Ivitorocái (= Amho), Kamé, Kayurukré, Tain (= Ingain), Taven.\" Some of these may have been tribal names; others were exonyms. Those living along the coast at the time of the Conquest were called \"Guayaná\", and are considered to be the ancestors of the Kaingang. It is unknown to what extent the names might have corresponded to dialectal differences.\n\nThe Kaingang language is classified as a member of the \"Ge\" family, the largest language family in the Macro-Ge stock. The Kaingang territory occupies the modern states of São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (and, until the beginning of the 20th century, Misiones, Argentina). Today they live in around 30 indigenous lands (similar to Native American reservations), especially at Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná.\n\nIn the 1960s, because of a missionary interest (conducted by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL)), the language was studied by Ursula Wiesemann.\n\nA large number of allophones map to a set of 14 phonemes:\n\nAll consonants have varying allophones depending on their position in the word and on the adjancency of nasal vowels:\n\n\nWiesemann proposed an alphabet for the language, which is still in use despite some problems. It is based on the Latin script, and consists of fourteen consonants and fourteen vowels, matching the fourteen consonants and fourteen vowels of the Kaingang language.\n\nThere are dictionaries and grammars available for Kaingang. A school was set up in 1969 to teach the Kaingang people to read and write their language. However, the school produced many Kaingang speakers who went back to their reservations to teach others and spread the writing innovations they learned. Only one of the dialects is used as the standard written form, though having the writing system provided a source of pride in the language for the Kaingang people. A Kaingang bible has been published, as well as a dictionary and other publications.\n\nExamples of Kaingang writing can be found on Omniglot.\n\nKaingang makes use of postpositions.\n\n\nPostpositions are also used to mark subject.\n\n\nKaingang verbs do not inflect.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1884726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1884726", "title": "Lau v. Nichols", "text": "Lau v. Nichols\n\nLau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court unanimously decided that the lack of supplemental language instruction in public school for students with limited English proficiency violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court held that since non-English speakers were denied a meaningful education, the disparate impact caused by the school policy violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the school district was demanded to provide students with \"appropriate relief\".\n\nIn 1971, the San Francisco school system desegregated based on the result of Supreme Court case \"Lee v. Johnson.\" 2856 Chinese students, who were not fluent in English, were integrated back into the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). Only about 1000 of those students were provided supplemental English instruction. Of the other 1800-plus Chinese students who weren't fluent in English, many were placed in special education classes while some were forced to be in the same grade for years.\n\nEven though the Bilingual Education Act was passed by Congress in 1968 to address the needs of Limited English Speaking Abilities students, the funding was limited. School participation in those programs was also voluntary, and by 1972, \"only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a Title VII-funded program.\"\n\nEdward H. Steinman, a public-interest lawyer, reached out to the parents of Kinney Kinmon Lau and other Chinese students with limited English proficiency. He encouraged them to challenge the school district, and they filed a class action suit against Alan H. Nichols, the president of the SFUSD at the time, and other officials in the school district. The students claimed that they were not receiving special help in school due to their inability to speak English, and they argued they were entitled to special help under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because of equal protection and the ban on educational discrimination.\n\nThe District Court for the Northern District of California denied the relief and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision. The District Court argued that since a uniform policy was used for all students in SFUSD and that the district didn't intentionally discriminate against students with limited English proficiency, equal protection was provided and the Fourteenth Amendment was not violated. The Court of Appeals claimed that since the school district provided the same treatment for all students, even though some students were disadvantaged due to their limited fluency in English, the school district was not required to make up for the different starting points of students. The students appealed the Court of Appeal's decision to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued its decision on January 21, 1974, with the Court unanimously ruling in favor of Lau. Instead of examining the equal protection clause from the 14th Amendment, the Court relied on Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Since the school system received federal funding, it was required to provide equal opportunities and access to all students. The Court claimed that even though the school districts provided equal treatment for all students, it still imposed disparate impact on the non-English speaking students since they were not able to understand the class material as effectively as other students and therefore were deprived of having \"meaningful\" education. The Court also referenced the guideline established by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1970, which stated that language could be used as a proxy of discrimination on national origin and that \"the district must take affirmative steps to rectify the language deficiency in order to open its instructional program to these students.\" The Supreme Court demanded the school district to make necessary changes to provide equal education to the non-English speakers, but it didn't state any specific remedies for the district to follow.\n\nJustice Potter Stewart, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun, concurred with this decision as he stated that affirmative remedial efforts, suggested by the OCR, were constitutional and appropriate in this case as long as the efforts were \"reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\" In his concurrence joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Blackmun also suggested that \"numbers are at the heart of this case\" and that if the case only involved a few students, rather than nearly 2,000, the decision would not be the same.\n\nLau remains an important decision in bilingual education history. In this case, the Supreme Court found the violation of Civil Rights Act of 1964 based on the discriminatory effect of the school policy regardless of the intent of the officials. It prohibited the \"sink and swim\" policy and set a precedent of finding disparate impact in violation of the Civil Rights Act. The decision was subsequently followed by the passing of Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 in Congress, which specifically prohibited discrimination against faculty and student in public schools and required the school districts to take \"appropriate action\" to overcome the barriers to equal participation of all students. It increased funding to the Bilingual Education Act and made additional English instruction mandatory, which effectively extended the Lau ruling to all public schools. The Officer for Civil Rights then developed a remedial guideline in 1975, otherwise known as the Lau Remedies, that specified methods and approaches for the school districts to follow in order to provide a meaningful education to students with limited English proficiency. This led to the development of bilingual programs and additional English instructions in most public schools.\n\nHowever, there have been challenges to the Lau decision in recent decades. In the Supreme Court case \"Alexander v. Sandoval\", 532 U.S. 275 (2001), the Court claimed that private plaintiffs did not have the right of action to sue against disparate impact violation under Title VI and they must provide proofs of intentional discrimination. It implied that students can no longer sue schools for policies that cause disparate impact, which significantly weakened the foundation of the Lau decision.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12718589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12718589", "title": "Lojban grammar", "text": "Lojban grammar\n\nThe grammar of Lojban is based on predicate logic. The majority of the grammar is borrowed from the prior \"logical language\" Loglan, and some of its features come from Láadan. The characteristic regularity, unambiguity, and versatility of Lojban grammar owes much to modern linguistics and computer programming—resources that were unavailable to the designers of earlier languages. Lojbanist Bob LeChevalier summarized one advantage of Lojban grammar as follows: \"Lojban moves beyond the restrictions of European grammar. It overtly incorporates linguistic universals, building in what is needed to support the expressivity of the whole variety of natural languages, including non-European ones.\"\n\nLojban texts can be parsed just as texts in programming languages are by using formal grammars such as PEG, YACC, Backus–Naur form. There are several parsers available.\n\nLojban has 6 vowels and 21 consonants. The phonemes are commensurate with graphemes, which means Lojban has 27 letters (\"lerfu\") each corresponding to a unique phoneme. Lojbanic graphemes can vary in mode; this article employs the Latin alphabet version, which is currently in the most common usage (see Orthography for more detail). The phonemes, on the other hand, are defined solely according to the International Phonetic Alphabet.\n\nThe tables below show typical realizations of sounds and the Latin alphabets in Lojban. In all cases except the rhotic consonant the first phoneme represents the preferred pronunciation, while the rest are the permitted variants intended to cover dissimilitude in pronunciation by speakers of different linguistic backgrounds.\n\nLojban has 16 diphthongs (a kind of sound which consists of a vowel plus a glide, always constituting a single syllable).\nThe combinations <ai>, <au>, <ei> and <oi>, for instance, are all realized as the corresponding falling diphthongs. Triphthongs exist as combinations of a rising and a falling diphthong, e.g. <iau>.\n\nThe vowels can be either rounded or unrounded. The consonants can be either aspirated or unaspirated, although the voiceless stops , and are usually aspirated to some degree. In general, consonants are not palatalized. The affricates /d͡ʒ/, /t͡ʃ/, /d͡z/, and /t͡s/ occur in Lojban. (Respectively, these are the sounds highlighted in the English words jar\", chair\", \"fads, and \"cats.) However, each is considered to be a combination of an appropriate stop and fricative phoneme: the sequences <dj>, <tc>, <dz> and <ts>, respectively. The rhotic sounds are all equally acceptable as an identical phoneme. <l>, <m>, <n>, and <r> may be syllabic.\n\nFor those who, given their native language background, may have trouble pronouncing (certain) consonant clusters, there is the option of inserting buffer vowels between them, as long as they differ sufficiently from the phonological vowels and are pronounced as short as possible. This mechanism can be described as a form of anaptyxis (vocalic epenthesis). Possible choices include , , and (but not , which is the rounded counterpart of and thus a valid realization of ). The resulting added syllables are completely ignored by the grammar, including for the purposes of stress determination.\n\nLojban may be written in different orthography systems as long as it meets the required regularities and unambiguities. Some of the reasons for such elasticity would be as follows:\n\nLojbanist Kena extends this principle to argue that even an original orthography of the language is to be sought.\nLojban's Latin alphabet consists of 23 lerfu \"a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p r s t u v x y z\" plus 3 semi-lerfu \"' , . \". They are intentionally ordered in accordance with that of ASCII characters.\n\nCapitalization may be applied to mark a non-standard stressed syllable as in cmevla, but they are not considered separate lerfu. Whether a single vowel or the entire syllable is capitalized is a matter of preference; for example, the name \"Josephine\" can be rendered as either or (without the capitalization, the ordinary rules of Lojban stress will cause the 'ze' syllable to be stressed instead).\n\nPunctuation marks are not mandatory; such notions as question or exclamation are expressed with words rather than unpronounced symbols.\n\nThis mode was conceived when the introductory Lojban brochure was translated into Russian. 23 lerfu \"а б в г д е ж з и к л м н о п р с т у ф х ш ъ\" plus 3 semi-lerfu \"', . \" are used. The hard sign \"ъ\" is assigned to the open-mid vowel. Diphthongs are written as vowel pairs, as in the Roman mode.\n\nKena argues for writing Lojban using Tengwar, arguing that:\n\nAdvocates of this mode include Eric S. Raymond.\n\nA Japanese hiragana version of Lojban orthography has been proposed, in which case more than 80 lerfu may be used. This mode is not without certain technical issues since the hiragana (and katakana too) are always syllabic, indicating an open syllable (with the exception of the final \"n\" sound), requiring some special attention when representing the Lojbanic consonant clusters. Several example haiku compositions in the orthography have been created.\n\nLojban has 3 word-classes: \"brivla\" (verbs or predicate words), \"cmavo\" (structure words), and \"cmevla\" (name words). Each of them has uniquely identifying morphological properties, so that one can unambiguously recognize which word is of which part of speech in a string of the language. They may be further divided in sub-classes (discussed respectively below).\n\nThere also exist affixes (\"rafsi\") assigned to some of the brivla and cmavo.\n\n\"brivla\" carry the content (semantic information) of an expression. The bare brivla corresponds to the verb in English. Additional words can be used to transform it into what corresponds to English common nouns, adjectives, or adverbs (although some modal cmavo too may have adverbial purposes). Brivla may be identified by the following morphological properties:\nA word such as will still be considered as a brivla because the special gluing vowel \"y\" between \"b\" and \"p\" is to be ignored and therefore a consonant cluster (\"b-p\") assumes its existence within it.\n\nUnlike verbs in English, brivla do not inflect for tense, person, or number.\n\nBrivla's sub-classes are as follows, with some examples.\n\nThe brivla which constitute the lexical core of the language are called \"gismu\". They are invariably five-letter words, which distinguishes it from the other types of brivla, and are in a form of either CVCCV or CCVCV (C stands for a consonant and V for a vowel). Being two syllables means that the general rule of gismu to be stressed penultimately will always cause the first syllable to be stressed.\nThey have been chosen or added as root words because they \nThe main source languages from which they were drawn are Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish. Here is further explanation of the nature of gismu by Cowan:\n\nAccording to Robin Turner, the creation was algorithmically done by computer.\n\nApproximately 1350 gismu exist, which is a relatively small number when compared to that of English words ranging from 450,000 up to 1,000,000. Theoretically, by learning only these root words, as well as their fragmental forms and some major structure words (cmavo), one will be able to communicate effectively in Lojban.\n\nThe form of brivla made of affixes (\"rafsi\") is called \"lujvo\".\n\"fu'ivla\" usually refers to things that are culture-specific (including Lojban culture) or to kinds of plants or animals, concepts which cannot be easily expressed as mere modifying-modified combinations of Lojban's internal root verbs (\"gismu\").\n\nfu'ivla can be subdivided into four types according to the extent to which they are modified, namely Stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 fu'ivla.\n\nThe longest form, quoting a foreign word/phrase while preserving its original spelling with particular structure words.\n\n\nThis stage involves lojbanizing the sound and spelling of the word.\n\nAt this stage a borrowed word is fully turned into a single brivla, having its own place structure. Since no brivla may have more than one meaning, it is often the case that they are attached by a rafsi (with a hyphen like \"-r-\", \"-n-\", or \"-l-\") categorizing or limiting the semantic scope of the word (such are called \"rafsi classifier\"). Again they always start with a consonant and end with a vowel.\nThese are the borrowings which are so common or so important that have become as short as possible, having no rafsi classifier. Unlike other brivla, they may begin with a vowel (preceded by a pause mark separating it from the previous word). Also the word must not be of a form that one can remove all the initial vowels (and apostrophes) and have a valid word.\nIt is possible to absorb a fu'ivla into a lujvo, with principles varying among Lojbanists. Notable proponents are Pierre Abbat and Jorge Llambías. Here are some comparisons of their methods drawn from the Lojban mailing list (as of July 2007):\n\nLojban particles, \"cmavo\", are recognized by following morphological properties:\nAnd they display one of the following letter patterns: V, VV, V'V, CV, CVV, CV'V. The form generally does not indicate anything about its grammatical function.\n\ncmavo can be sequenced without spaces and without any change to its meaning:\n\nAs far as the stress rules of Lojban are concerned, such compound cmavo are still separate words, so penultimate stress (e.g. \"paREci\") is not obligatory.\n\nSome cmavo have rafsi, which may help converting tanru (sequence of brivla) into lujvo:\ncmevla are mostly used for names of things (including people) in descriptions or in direct address (cf. proper nouns). They can be in any form as long as they end in a consonant. The practice by which names in natural languages are modified to be used in Lojban is known as \"lojbanization\".\n\nA special building block, from which a new lujvo may be created, is called \"rafsi\". Rafsi are bound to certain gismu, cmavo or fu'ivla. This also means that lujvo have no rafsi form of their own. Rafsi cannot by themselves function as an individual words; they only form lujvo when at least two are joined together.\nThe unambiguity of Lojban morphology, according to John Woldemar Cowan, gives rise to \"significant clues to the meaning and the origin of the word, even if you have never heard the word before\". He further says: \"The same principle allows you, when speaking or writing, to invent new brivla for new concepts 'on the fly'; yet it offers people that you are trying to communicate with a good chance to figure out your meaning. In this way, Lojban has a flexible vocabulary which can be expanded indefinitely.\"\n\nAccording to \"What Is Lojban?\", the language's grammatical structures are \"defined by a set of rules that have been tested to be unambiguous using computers\", which is called the \"machine grammar\". Hence the characteristics of the standard syntactic (not semantic) constructs in Lojban:\n\n\nSuch standards, however, are to be attained with certain carefulness:\n\nThe computer-tested, unambiguous rules also include grammar for 'incomplete' sentences e.g. for narrative, quotational, or mathematical phrases.\n\nLojbanic expressions are modular; smaller constructs of words are assembled into larger phrases so that all incorporating pieces manifest as a possible grammatical unity. This mechanism allows for simplistic yet infinitely powerful phrasings; \"a more complex phrase can be placed inside a simple structure, which in turn can be used in another instance of the complex phrase structure\".\n\nBeing derived from predicate logic, the basic unit of Lojban expression is predication, a claim that some objects stand in some relationship, or that some single object has some property. In Lojban they are expressed using clauses (\"bridi\"). Just as a predication is formed by a predicate and arguments in formal logic, bridi are formed by \"selbri\" and \"sumti\" in Lojban. In linguistic terms \"selbri\" is the predicate of a clause, and \"sumti\" are its arguments. A construct of selbri and sumti produces a claim that something stands in a specified relationship to something else or has a specified property.\nMultiple bridi can be either sequenced across multiple sentences or compounded in one sentence:\nA compound bridi can include multiple tenses and sumti:\nThe implicit grammatical divisions can be made explicit by separator words such as \"cu\" and \"vau\", which are often elidable but sometimes need to be present to avoid ambiguity:\nThe places of \"cu\" and \"vau\" in the previous examples can be rendered as follows:\nThe ordered sets of sumti assigned to every selbri are known as \"place structures\". They are explicitly defined in dictionaries or word lists.\n\nSome lujvo formations usually operate on the place structure in predictable ways. The rafsi \"gau\", for instance, inserts one place for the agent and pushes all others down one. Thus brivla can have indefinitely many places. This contrasts with the accusative alignment or ergative alignment that most languages have, in which there is a small number of named places (subject, direct object, indirect object) and all others are expressed by prepositions.\n\nThe typology of Lojban is basically subject–verb–object, with subject–object–verb also common. However, it can practically be anything. All the following sentences mean \"I love you\", differing only in word order:\n\nSuch flexibility has to do with the language's intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system. The meaning of the sentence \"mi prami do\" is determined by \"prami\" realizing, with its own predefined place structure, a specific semantic relation between \"mi\" and \"do\"; when the positional relation between \"mi\" and \"do\" changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too. As shown above, Lojban has particular devices to preserve such semantic structure of words while altering their order. Compare the followings:\n\n\"se\" converts the x1 and x2 sumti place. \"fo\" tags the x4 place, and \"fi\" the x3. Such conversion and tagging is often used to emphasize particular sumti by bringing it forward.\n\nHere are some collations of natural languages and Lojban:\nIt is important to note that Lojban selbri is not a real equivalent of verb in natural languages. A selbri can be either a verb, a noun, an adjective, or an adverb. Its function is determined syntactically, not morphologically. An analogy to natural language word orders by using such terms as \"subject\", \"verb\", and \"object\" cannot accurately describe the nature of Lojban bridi.\n\nThere are five kinds of simple sumti:\nBasic descriptions in Lojban consist of two units, LE/LA descriptors and a selbri:\nAlthough is quite close in meaning to English \"the\", it has particularly unique implications. In this example, creates an argument which might occur in the x1 place of the belonging selbri , namely a \"market\". also specifies that the speaker 1) has one or more specific markets in mind (whether or not the listener knows which ones they are) and 2) is merely describing the things he/she has in mind as markets, without being committed to the truth of that description. Whereas English-speakers must differentiate between \"the market\" and \"the markets\", Lojban-speakers are not required to make such a choice (this rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of specifying the number of markets in such a case):\nSince the construct + \"selbri\" merely describes something or other which the speaker chooses to represent based on his/her observation, such an expression as follows is possible:\n\nWhile is specific, is not:\n\nAll descriptions implicitly terminate with , which can almost always be omitted with no danger of ambiguity. The main exceptions are a) when relative clauses are involved and b) when a description immediately precedes the selbri (in which case using an explicit before the selbri makes the unnecessary). Other usages of include making a compound negator () and terminating place-structure/tense/modal tags (, ).\n\nThe selbri is the logical predicate of a bridi. This is not to be confused with the meaning of predicate in terms of the English Language, but as a \"logical\" predicate. Whereas a predicate in English contains everything that the subject is doing, a logical predicate is simply the relation between all involved parties. In this context, the selbri is roughly the equivalent of a verb in English. For instance:\nThe gismu \"nelci\" is being used as the selbri in this bridi. It is describing the relationship between the sumtis \"mi\" (I) and \"le gerku\" (the dog). The relationship is that of a liker and that which is liked. The roles in the relationship are determined by the sumti placements inherent in the word being used as the selbri. The cmavo \"se/te/ve/xe\" are used to swap the first sumti placement of the selbri with the second, third, fourth, and fifth sumti placement, respectively. This functionality allows for the flexibility in bridi. For instance, the gismu \"klama\" has the sumti of:\n\nThus:\nSelbri can also be tanru, where the sumti placements are determined by the last brivla that is part of the tanru. For instance:\n\nA group of two or more selbri put one after another is called \"tanru\" and acts as a single selbri (while the selbri it is composed of are called tanru units (\"selbrisle\")). They correspond to English compound verbs like \"drip fry\" or \"drip dry\".\n\nTanru can be converted to sumti as usual selbri.\n\nTanru may be used so as to more specifically conceptualize the intended meaning. In \"lo skami pilno\" (\"computer user(s)\"), there is a tanru \"skami pilno\" where the modifying brivla \"skami\" narrows the sense of the modified brivla \"pilno\" to form a more specific concept (in which case the modifier may resemble English adverbs or adjectives). Without \"skami\", \"lo pilno\" will just mean \"user\". Other examples:\nArguments of selbri representing tanru units may be filled as well, in which case they are attached using the particle \"be\" (starting from x2 place of the tanru unit):\nThe \"cmavo\" consist of various particles and structure words. These include descriptors, connectives, attitudinals, prepositions, and tense words.\n\nThere are five descriptors (\"gadri\" in Lojban): \"lo\", \"le\", \"la\", \"li\", and \"me'o\"; of which the first three inflect to show individual, mass, or set (though as far as the formal grammar is concerned, the inflected forms are separate words, not inflected forms).\nThe individual/mass distinction is similar to the distinction between mass nouns and count nouns, but things that are normally counted can be considered as a mass. The set articles consider the mathematical set of the referents.\n\nThe number and mathematical expression articles are used when talking about numbers and numerals or letters as themselves.\n\nNote that \"gadri\" are sometimes called \"articles\", which doesn't correspond to the usual notion of articles in linguistics.\n\nAs befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of conjunctions.\n\nThere exist 16 possible different truth functions, the four fundamental ones of which are assigned four vowels in Lojban. These vowels are a component sound from which actual logical-connective cmavo are built up.\n\nWith the four vowels, the ability to negate either sentence (with \"na\" or \"nai\"), and the ability to exchange the sentences, as if their order had been reversed (with \"se\"), Lojban can create all of the 16 possible truth functions except TTTT and FFFF (which are fairly useless anyway).\n\n\".onai\" is preferred over \"na.o\". Note that in \"se.unai\", the negation occurs before \"swapping\" the positions of A and B. While \"se\" can be used for the other connectives, it is unnecessary since \"or\", \"and\", and \"if and only if\" have the same relationship if their inputs are swapped (i.e. they are commutative).\n\nIn order to remain unambiguous, each place in the grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted has its appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to connect selbri, ambiguity would result. Connections between components other than sumti can be expressed as follows (note that their functions are in accordance with the assigned vowels):\nNegatives and \"se\" can be used with these connectives with similar forms.\nConnections can also be given using \"forethought\" forms\nNegatives are created by adding \"nai\" to the connective before the negated construct.\n\nConnections can be questioned:\nBesides the logical connectives, there are several non-logical connectives. These do not change form depending on what they are connecting:\n\nThe \"ku\" is required by the LALR parser, but not by the PEG parser, which however is not official yet.\n\nAttitudinals are a set of cmavo which allow the speakers to express their \"emotional state\" or \"source of knowledge\", or the \"present stage of discourse\". In natural languages, attitudes are expressed using interjections, but also by the tone of voice when speaking, and (very imperfectly) by punctuation when writing; in Lojban, such information are extensively expressible in words. And the meanings are to be understood separately from the main predicate.\n\nThey may be \"scaled\" by suffixes:\n\nCombination is possible, and highly productive as well as creative:\n\n\"Evidentials\", derived from those of American Indian languages and the constructed language Láadan, show how the speaker came to say the utterance, i.e. the source of the information or the idea:\nThere are two kinds of prepositions (\"sumtcita\", which refers to adpositions in general) in Lojban: tense markers and proper prepositions. The syntactic difference is that a proper preposition can be converted with \"se\", whereas a tense marker cannot. All proper prepositions (except the vague one \"do'e\") are formed from a brivla and mark their object semantically as being in a place of that brivla. Thus the following are equivalent:\n\nPrepositions (including tense markers) can also be placed in \".i ... bo\" to make sentence conjunctions. With most prepositions this makes no sense, but \"ki'u\", \"ja'e\", \"mu'i\" and \"ni'i\" are often used this way to express various kinds of \"because\" and \"therefore\":\n\nLojban has 63 unique tense words to express various aspects of both \"space\" and \"time\" as well as \"event\": such a system is unusual among other languages, in that it deals with spatial and temporal aspects in the same term. Simply put, these tense words are used to show where and when the event is taking place, relative in space-time to when the sentence is spoken.\nThey can be roughly subdivided as follows:\n\nThe \"converters\" require further explanation: marks that the movement is towards (or away from, etc.) a point rather than at a point, so that , meaning \"(occurring) in the north\", becomes , \"(heading) northward\"; marks the number of times an event takes place, e.g. (once), (always), (never), indicated an ordinal, e.g. , first time; marks an interval in space rather than in time, so that, for example, is the \"beginning point\" of something physically extending in a given direction; is used to mark tense words that have been moved in a sentence, comparable to and for sumti; marks a \"sticky tense\", as explained below.\n\nMarking tenses is always optional in Lojban:\n\nWhere the tense information is not specified, the context resolves the interpretation.\n\nTense words are usually put right before the selbri:\nThey may be placed elsewhere with the additional terminator :\n\nThe terminator is used so that the tense word do not directly run into the following sumti and modify it. Compare the next sentences:\nTenses can be \"layered up\":\n\nTenses can be \"sticky\" by being set with , continuing in effect over more than a single bridi, until it is unset:\nThe second resets the tense to the implicit default time from the speaker's point of view, which is \"now\" (this means that may be used as a tense word by itself).\n\nUsing , equivalents of the previous layering tenses can be produced:\nThe second is to be counted from the tense set by the last , so in effect it is equivalent to .\n\nSimilar to the tense words are a collection of words to show potentiality: , \"actually is\"; , \"is innately capable of\"; , \"can but has not\"; , \"can and has\". These words operate in the same way as tense words.\nSemantic unifications and combinations are performed by word groupings, each include a starting and a (often elidable) terminating cmavo. Here basic example sentences with them are ordered by their terminating cmavo:\nFurthermore ku'e, lo'o, te'u and ve'o are terminators for mathematical expressions.\n\n"}

In a well-known episode, a ship of anti-revolutionary French Royalists is sailing towards Brittany, to aid the anti-revolutionary Chouannerie rebellion. While at sea, a sailor fails to properly secure his cannon, which rolls out of control and damages the ship. The sailor risks his life to secure the cannon and save the ship. The Marquis de Lantenac, leader of the Royalists, awards the man a medal for his bravery and then executes him without trial for failing in his duty.\n\nThe widespread publication of Hugo's book, both in the original French and in translation to various other languages, helped make the concept of a loose cannon more well-known. It has eventually developed a metaphorical meaning relating to a person who is acting in a wild and unpredictable manner and who constitutes as much danger to his or her own side as to the enemy.\n"}

Rural settlers known as \"potato Germans\" and \"\" also brought their own languages to Danish farms. During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Dutch was spoken among descendants of Dutch/Flemish settlers on the island of Amager (Dragør, Store Magleby and Christianshavn). In its heyday, the Royal Danish Navy was largely manned by Norwegian speakers. Additionally, North Frisian was spoken on the North Frisian Islands. During the 19th century, German Jews brought the Yiddish language to Copenhagen and a few other towns, and in the early 20th century, an influx of Russian Jews gave this language a brief revival. \n\nHowever, subsequent generations of all these groups have overwhelmingly abandoned their ancestral languages and assimilated into the general population.\n\nFramework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities entered into force in Denmark on 1 February 1998 while European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages entered into force on 1 January 2001.\n\nNorth Schleswig Germans language rights are protected by the Copenhagen-Bonn Declarations of 1955.

Barlow\n\nRobert Hayward Barlow (May 18, 1918 – January 1 or 2, 1951) was an American author, avant-garde poet, anthropologist and historian of early Mexico, and expert in the Nahuatl language. He was a correspondent and friend of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft and was appointed by Lovecraft the executor of his literary estate.\n\nBorn at a time when his father Lieutenant Colonel Everett Darius Barlow, was serving with the American Forces in France, Barlow spent much of his youth at Fort Benning, Georgia, where his father was stationed but also moved from army post to army post in his earliest years. as a result, he never received much formal schooling but he was a brilliant youth and pursued his education on his own. Around 1932 Col. Barlow received a medical discharge, retired on disability from the army and settled his wife (Bernice Barlow) and son in the small town of DeLand, in central Florida where he built a lakeside homestead.\n\nFamily difficulties later forced Robert H. Barlow to move to Washington, D.C., where in 1934, as the son of a retired army officer, he received treatment for over-strained eyes at an army facility before returning to DeLand in 1935. In 1936, he received training at the Kansas City Art Institute, where Thomas Hart Benton was one of his teachers, and subsequently at San Francisco Junior College. Barlow settled for a time with the Beck family in Lakeport, California, where he helped publish H. P. Lovecraft's \"Commonplace Book\" and several other items from Beck's Futile Press. From Lakeport was mailed the second and final issue of his legendary amateur magazine \"Leaves\", which he and Lovecraft had planned together before the latter's death. \n\nFollowing a suggestion from an interested counsellor and friend, Barbara Mayer, that Barlow make the study of Mexico's antiquities his goal, he went to Mexico in 1940-41, studied at the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, and upon his return to California received the B.A. degree at the University of California in 1942. Returning to Mexico as a permanent resident, he joined the staff of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. In 1944 he received a Rockefeller Foundation and in 1946-48 a Guggenheim Fellowship. He became head of the Department of Anthropology at Mexico City College, which position he held at the time of his passing on January 2, 1951.\n\nAccording to fellow anthropologist Charles E. Dibble, \"In the brief span of a decade, Barlow gave Middle American research an impetus and perspective of enduring consequence. His contributions in Mexican archaeology, classical and modern Nahuatl, Mexican colonial history, and what he preferred to call \"Bilderhandschriften\" are of lasting importance.\" Dibble compared Barlow's zeal for searching for and deciphering little known or dimly recalled codices and colonial manuscripts to that of Zelia Nuttall. Barlow has been referred to as \"the T. E. Lawrence of Mexico.\" \n\nBarlow had been a friend of writers H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard since he was 13. He collaborated with Lovecraft on at least six stories (\"The Slaying of the Monster\" (1933); \"The Hoard of the Wizard-Beast\" (1933); the spoof \"The Battle That Ended the Century\" (1934); \"Till A’the Seas\" (1935); an unfinished parody, \"Collapsing Cosmoses\" (1935); and \"The Night Ocean\" (1936)), and Lovecraft made several extended visits to the young Barlow at his home in DeLand, Florida.\n\nBarlow attempted to bind and distribute Lovecraft's story \"The Shunned House\" (1928) but bound only a few copies (Arkham House distributed some bound versions of the original Barlow project as late as the 1970s).\n\nBarlow aided significantly in the preservation of Lovecraft's manuscripts by typing texts in exchange for autograph manuscripts.\n\nBarlow came to Providence immediately upon receiving a telegram from Lovecraft's aunt Annie Gamwell about Lovecraft's death. Lovecraft's \"Instructions In Case Of Decease\", a separate document from his will, appointed Barlow his literary executor. Lovecraft biographer S.T. Joshi says that this document was never probated but that Ms. Gamwell created a formal contract confirming that Barlow was to have all of Lovecraft's manuscripts and notebooks, to publish as he saw fit, earnings from said publication to go to Ms. Gamwell with a 3% commission for himself.Lovecraft biographer W. Scott Poole says that Ms. Gamwell did have the document probated. Barlow donated most of the manuscripts and some printed matter to the John Hay Library of Brown University.\n\nBarlow transcribed Lovecraft's story \"The Shadow Out of Time\" and had the manuscript still in his possession when he secured a teaching position at Mexico City College. When he later became Chairman of the Department of Anthropology, he met June Ripley, a postgraduate student studying the Nahuatl language, Barlow's specialty. The two apparently became friends and Barlow entrusted the manuscript to Ripley before his suicide. She remained in Mexico for seven more years, then taught at several places in the United States before retiring in 1993. She died on December 28, 1994, and the long-lost Lovecraft manuscript was found by Ripley's sister-in-law Lucille Shreve. The manuscript, written in pencil in a child's notebook, was donated by Nelson and Lucille Shreve to the Lovecraft collection of John Hay Library.\n\nBarlow was interested in printing and after becoming involved in the early 'fan' scene relating to fantasy and science fiction, published several important journals - \"The Dragon-Fly\" (two issues - October 15, 1935, and May 15, 1936); and \"Leaves\" (two issues - Summer 1937; Winter 1938/39). . He was also proprietor of his imprint, the Dragon-Fly Press (Cassia, Florida) and under that imprint published two important works by members of the Lovecraft Circle - \"The Goblin Tower\" (the first verse collection by Frank Belknap Long – Lovecraft helped Barlow set the type for this) and \"The Cats of Ulthar\", a story by H. P. Lovecraft. \n\nBarlow's fiction career was interrupted in 1937 by a variety of circumstances, including the death of his friend and mentor Lovecraft, and his own uprooting from Florida because of family troubles. In 1938 he edited Lovecraft's \"Notes and Commonplace Book\" and in 1939 edited \"After Sunset\" (John Howell, 1939), a collection of the best poems written by George Sterling in the last years before Sterling's suicide in 1926.\n\nIn 1943, Barlow lent assistance to the first bibliography of Lovecraft (by Francis T. Laney and William H. Evans). His poignant memoir of Lovecraft, \"The Wind That is in the Grass\" can be found in \"Marginalia\" (Arkham House, 1944). Barlow also contributed the introduction for the 1944 Arkham House volume \"Jumbee and Other Uncanny Tales\" by his fellow Floridian and \"Weird Tales\" author Henry S. Whitehead.\n\nBarlow was highly regarded as a sculptor, before his move into anthropology, and in one letter (to Clark Ashton Smith, May 16, 1937) he complained that people took this work more seriously than his writings. But it appears that none of his sculptural work has survived.\n\nBarlow moved permanently to Mexico around 1943, where he taught at several colleges, and in 1948 became chairman of the anthropology department at Mexico City College and a distinguished anthropologist of Indigenous Mesoamerican culture. He taught classes at Mexico City College, to mostly American students who were mostly there under funding from the post-war G.I. Bill. The famous writer William S. Burroughs, who lived in Mexico from 1950 to 1952, studied the Mayan Codices under Barlow in the first half of 1950. Burroughs went on at least one field trip with him to the Temple of Quetzalcoatl in Teotihuacan. The Mayan symbolism and political structure he found there later featured heavily in Burroughs' fiction.\n\nAt the same time Barlow cooperated with Prof. Salvador Mateos Higuera in a descriptive study of Mexican codices. Within a brief three years he had cooperated with George T. Smisor to plan and edit \"Tlalocan\", a journal of source materials on native cultures of Mexico. Beginning in 1943 with the appearance of \"Tlalocan\" his productivity attained added momentum and his articles appeared with increasing frequency in the scholarly journals of Mexico, United States and Europe. Concern for minutiae led to such works of detail as \"The 18th Century \"Relaciones Geograficas\"\".\n\nHe travelled to the Yucatán to study the Mayans, and to western Guerrero, where he studied the Tepuztecs. He founded two scholarly journals, and published around a hundred and fifty articles, pamphlets, and books.\n\nIn 1950 he published \"Mexihkatl itonalama\" (\"The Mexican's calendar\"), a Nahuatl-language newspaper. His work in Mesoamerican anthropology is of pioneering significance, and his collected anthropological papers are in the process of publication in Mexico. At this time Barlow was also continuing his work a poet, writing both formalist verse and experimental verse of the Activist school pioneered by Lawrence Hart.\n\nBarlow had written as early as 1944 that he had \"a subtle feeling that my curious and uneasy life is not destined to prolong itself\". He killed himself at his home in Azcapotzalco, D.F, Mexico, on the first or second of January, 1951, apparently fearing the exposure of his homosexuality by a disgruntled student. On that afternoon, he locked himself in his room, took 26 capsules of Seconal, leaving pinned upon his door in Mayan pictographs \"Do not disturb me. I want to sleep a long time.\"\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, then studying Spanish, the Mexican codices and the Mayan language under Barlow, briefly described his death in a letter to Allen Ginsberg, dated January 11: \"A queer Professor from K.C., Mo., head of the Anthropology dept. here at M.C.C. [Mexico City College] where I collect my $75 per month, knocked himself off a few days ago with overdose of goof balls. Vomit all over the bed. I can’t see this suicide kick.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For example, half of South America is part of the Spanish sprachraum, while a single, small country like Switzerland is at the intersection of three such language spheres. A sprachraum can also be separated by oceans.\nThe four major Western sprachraums are those of English, Spanish, Portuguese and French (according to the number of speakers). The English sprachraum (Anglosphere) spans the globe, from the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to the many former British colonies where English has official language status alongside local languages, such as India and South Africa. The French sprachraum, which also has area on several continents, is known as the Francophonie (). La Francophonie is also the name of an international organisation composed of countries with French as an official language. \n\nThe Portuguese sprachraum or Lusosphere or Lusophony () is a cultural entity that includes the countries where Portuguese is the official language, as well as the Portuguese diaspora. It also includes people who may not have any Portuguese ancestry but are culturally and linguistically linked to Portugal. The Community of Portuguese Language Countries or Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (Portuguese: \"Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa\", abbreviated to CPLP) is the intergovernmental organisation for friendship among Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) nations where Portuguese is an official language.\n\nBy extension, a sprachraum can also include a group of related languages. Thus the Scandinavian sprachraum includes Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, while the Finnic sprachraum is Finland, Estonia and adjacent areas of Scandinavia and Russia. \n\nEven within a single sprachraum, there can be different, but closely related, languages, otherwise known as dialect continua. A classic example is the varieties of Chinese, which can be mutually unintelligible in spoken form, but are typically considered the same language (or, at least, closely related) and have a unified non-phonetic writing system. Arabic has a similar situation, but its writing system (an abjad) reflects the pronunciation of a common literary language (Modern Standard Arabic).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2682210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2682210", "title": "Sri Lankan English", "text": "Sri Lankan English\n\nSri Lankan English (SLE, en-LK) or Ceylonese English is the English language as it is spoken in Sri Lanka. However, the classification of SLE as a separate dialect of English is controversial. English in Sri Lanka is fluently spoken by approximately 48% of the population, and widely used for official and commercial purposes. It is the native language of approximately 74,000 people.\n\nThe British colonial presence in South Asia led to the introduction of English to Sri Lanka. Since 1681, some words have been borrowed from the Sinhala and Tamil language by English. In 1948, Sri Lanka gained independence from the United Kingdom and English was no longer the only official language. In subsequent years, inequality in access to education, and national conflict have confounded the development and use of SLE, particularly in Sri Lankan literature. SLE may vary from British or American English in elements such as colloquialisms, vocabulary, syntax, pronunciation and emphasis of syllables.\n\nSri Lankan words that were borrowed by the English and are used in the language are recorded in \"A Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon in the East Indies\". Such words often relate to flora and fauna:\n\n\nColloquialisms have emerged in SLE. Some involve vocabulary. Others involve grammar (such as tense and plurals), syntax and intonation. Some may be common to Indian English.\n\nWords and tags may be added, subtracted, overused, or changed in order and tense in SLE.\n\nSpeakers of Sri Lankan English may have varying ability in producing some sounds. Again, the sound of in \"father\" and in \"luck\"are absent in Sinhala and so are variably difficult for people from Sri Lanka to pronounce in SLE.\n\nMetathesis occur, as they do in many languages. For instance, \"exercise\" may be pronounced as \"ex-cise\".\n\nSome differences in pronunciation may relate to socioeconomic background and level of education. For example, a word like \"note\" is pronounced with a diphthong, in standard English. In SLE, it is pronounced with the monophthong; and is accepted as normal in Sri Lanka. However, pronouncing a word like \"hall\" () as * is not accepted. Other words pronounced with a monophthong include: take and made.\n\nThose unfamiliar with English may add an involuntary /i-/ prior to words like \"skill\" and \"smell\". However, this is not standard in SLE.\n\nThe speaker of SLE may not use contractions as readily as English. For example, \"What is the matter?\" would be used over \"What's the matter?\"\n\nSome elided syllables in English are pronounced in SLE. For example, \"different\" would be pronounced \"diff-er-ent\" (). Also, some syllables normally unstressed and sounded as /ə/ may be sounded as /a(ː)/ (or, /o/, /u/, /e/ or /i/). For example, the word \"camera\" () may become .\n\nIn SLE, the first syllable may be emphasised rather than the usual second or third. Examples include, \"address\", \"cassette\", \"dessert\", \"museum\", \"hotel\" and \"gazette\". One may also see differences in the allocation of primary and secondary syllable stresses.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2841231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2841231", "title": "The Monkey and the Cat", "text": "The Monkey and the Cat\n\nThe Monkey and the Cat is best known as a fable adapted by Jean de La Fontaine under the title \"Le Singe et le Chat\" that appeared in the second collection of his \"Fables\" in 1679 (IX.17). Although there is no evidence that the story existed before the 15th century, it began to appear in collections of Aesop's Fables from the 17th century but is not included in the Perry Index. There are popular idioms derived from it in both English and French with the general meaning of being the dupe of another (e.g., a cat's-paw). Usage of these and reference to the fable have been particularly employed in (although not limited to) political contexts.\n\nIn La Fontaine's telling, Bertrand the monkey persuades Raton the cat to pull chestnuts from the embers amongst which they are roasting, promising him a share. As the cat scoops them from the fire one by one, burning his paw in the process, the monkey gobbles them up. They are disturbed by a maid entering and the cat gets nothing for its pains. It is from this fable that the French get their idiom \"Tirer les marrons du feu\", meaning to act as someone's dupe or, deriving from that, to benefit from the dirty work of others. It is also the source of the English idiom 'a cat's paw', defined in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as 'one used by another as a tool'. There are earlier idiomatic allusions in 15th century Burgundian sources. Jean Miélot records the saying \"c'est un bon jeu de chat et singe\" (it's a cat and monkey game) in his \"Proverbes\" (1456) and there is another apparent reference to the story in a poem in Jean Molinet's \"Faictz et dictz\". In the following century, Jean-Antoine de Baïf has the version \"faire comme le singe, tirer les marrons du feu avec la patte du chat\" in his \"Mimes, enseignements et proverbes\" (1575) and John Florio includes the saying in his collection of idioms \"Second Frutes\" (1591).\n\nHowever, the earliest surviving texts relating the story date from the mid-16th century and some of these have a puppy in place of a cat as the monkey's victim. Johannes Sambucus reports it as happening recently in the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom in his \"Emblemata\" (1564). The Latin poem there continues, 'A small monkey gave us an example noteworthy and amusing for its cunning. For, when he saw the chestnuts buried in the hearth, he began to brush the ash aside but, afraid of the burning coals, he suddenly seized the foot of a sleeping puppy and stole it out.' The same story involving a sleeping dog appeared in other emblem books, including the \"Choice of Emblemes\" by the English poet Geoffrey Whitney (1586), who draws a political lesson from it in common with the other emblematists:\nA version in which a cat figures is in Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder's illustrated book of fables, \"De warachtighe fabulen der dieren\" (True animal fables, Bruges, 1567), with Flemish verse provided by the foremost Netherlandic emblematist . A French version of the \"Fabulen\" was published in 1578 under the title \"Esbatement moral des animaux\". There were several adaptations of Gheeraert's figure in the following century. The Dutch poet Joost van den Vondel published an emblematic collection based on his prints, \"Vorstelijke Warande der Dieren\" (Princely pleasure-ground of beasts, Amsterdam 1617), in which the poem \"Den aap en de katte\" appears. In England the scene was reused as one of twelve circular engravings, intended for trenchers, made in 1630-36. The text around the edge of the picture reads: \"The Monkey seing nuts in fire Doth force the Cat to plucke them neir; Which showeth the Envious doth not care, Whose House do burne so they have share\". In Germany it was incorporated into a view of the Schloss Johannisberg wine estate in 's \"Thesaurus Philopoliticus\" (later known as the \"Sciographia Cosmica\") of 1623. In this combination of the Emblem book and collection of town plans, the scene of the fable takes place on the lower right and is accompanied by verses illustrating the Latin moral, \"Alterius Damno Quaeris Lucrum\" (Another is duped to benefit the greedy)\n\nElsewhere in Europe, the monkey and cat version appears in Simone Majoli's Latin work \"Dies caniculares\" (1588), where it is told of the antics of the pet monkey of Pope Julius II at the start of the century; a little later the story appeared as \"Un Singe et un Chat\" in Philippe Deprez's collection of a hundred verse fables, \"Le Théâtre des animaux\" (Paris, 1595). It is from one or other of these last two that La Fontaine is said to have adapted his story. Even before he popularised it, the earlier version had been used by two artists: the Roman painter Tommaso Salini and the Dutch animal painter Abraham Hondius. Both of these illustrate the detail that La Fontaine chose to modify, in which the monkey uses the cat's paw to poke out the chestnuts against its will. A third version of the story, yet again quoted as happening recently, was contained in Gemelli Careri's \"Voyage round the world\" (1695) and related by 'the admiral of the Portuguese fleet in India' as witnessed by him.\n\nOne of the channels through which the fable was taken to be Aesop's was its inclusion among the hydraulic statues in the labyrinth of Versailles in 1669. These were accompanied by quatrains by Isaac de Benserade, which subsequently appeared in \"Les fables d'Ésope, mises en françois, avec le sens moral en quatre vers, & des figures à chaque fable\" (Aesop's fables in French, with a verse commentary and illustrations, 1709). Here the initial quatrain refers to the version where force is used ('The monkey looks sprightly/ but the cat doesn't take lightly/ having its paw acquired/ to pull chestnuts from the fire') while the prose telling which follows is of La Fontaine's version. The statue accompanied by De Benserade's verse is described in Daniel Bellamy's 18th century description of the labyrinth: 'Upon a shell composed of brass, and supported by a column erected in the antique taste with the same metal, the spectator is amused with the resemblance of a large fire, from whence issues a torrent of water. Here a monkey appears with a smiling countenance, grasping a cat's paw with his own, whilst the latter is seemingly struggling to get loose.'\n\nIt was a version in which the monkey uses force that was painted by Edwin Landseer in 1824 and by his 19th century imitator (see the gallery below). When the former painting was put up for auction in January 2011, U.S. Christie's recorded that 'The subject of the present painting is taken from the ancient fable traditionally ascribed to Aesop'. While this is far from true, the fable had been appearing in collections of Aesop's Fables since the 17th century. Where the story is ascribed to Aesop, it is in the version where the monkey forcibly uses the cat's paw. La Fontaine's modified version of 1679 can only be regarded as original for the detail of persuasion rather than compulsion. It was translated by neither of La Fontaine's main 18th century English translators, Bernard de Mandeville (1704) and Charles Denis (1754), but was ascribed to him in the verse \"Flowers of Fable\" in 1832. Charles H. Bennett also included the story in his \"The Fables of Aesop and Others, translated into Human Nature\" (1857) under the title of \"The Cat's Paw\". Referring back to the plot of Oliver Twist, Bennett's cat acts as thief's apprentice to the monkey.\n\nLa Fontaine applies the fable to statecraft,\nand was later followed in this by political cartoonists. One English example, dating from 1766 and titled \"The Cat's Paw\", satirises a political alliance of the time and represents the Earl of Bute as a monkey, using the paw of the feline Earl of Chatham to extract chestnuts from a fire. Use of the idiom at this date is one of the earliest examples in English. The satirist Peter Pindar (John Wolcot) continued the political use of the fable by including a lengthy reference to it in his ode “To the Chancellor of the Exchequer” (1801), in the context of the argument over Catholic Emancipation. Soon after, the same issue was illustrated in a caricature from 1804 titled \"The monkey and the cat's paw, a fable from Esop\".\n\nThe cat's paw title was to be used once again in a cartoon relating to the political maneuvering that preceded the passing of the English Reform Act in 1832. In this King William IV is the cat, being coaxed by the bewigged Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham, depicted as a monkey seated at his side, to pull the hot iron of reform from a blazing fire. In this case the reference is to La Fontaine's version of the story. Another contemporary source to draw a parallel between the passing of the bill and the fable was the satirical paper \"Figaro in London\". There the claim is made that the Irish members of Parliament halted agitations for wider representation while the Reform Bill was being passed and were now cheated of a similar reward. The political leader Daniel O'Connell is likened to the cat in the fable and the report is followed by the poem, “The grey monkey and the Irish cat”, concluding with the lines “And thus 'twill always be, whoever lingers/ About the grate is sure to burn his fingers”. The idiom of getting one's fingers burned alludes, according to \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\", “to taking chestnuts from the fire”.\n\nIn France the fable was often used to satirise the ambitious sacrificing the life of others for their own ends. The cartoon \"Bertrand avec Raton s'amusent à tirer les marrons du feu\", dating from Napoleonic times, pictures a red uniformed monkey marshall guiding a blue-uniformed infantryman in the task. The theme reappeared in the broadside \"La Caricature\" with the title \"The monkey and the cat: a military pastime\". Another cartoon has a marquis urging a barefoot patriotic workman to take his place on a republican barricade, while chuckling to himself that soon the artistocratic exiles will return with their allies to impose a renewed feudalism. This too is titled \"Bertrand et Raton\".\n\nThe French dramatist Eugène Scribe gave the same title to his social comedy of 1833. Subtitled \"l'art de conspirer\" (the art of conspiracy), it has also been translated as 'The school for politicians' and is a reworking of a play of the same name by Louis-Benoît Picard (1805). It is ostensibly based on an episode of Danish history and concerns a bourgeois dupe caught up in political intrigue. In reality it satirises the July Revolution of 1830.\n\nIn the Netherlands the words of Vondel's \"Den aap en de katte\" were set for a cappella male chorus by Sem Dresden to celebrate the centenary of the Royal Dutch Choir in 1953. In the aftermath of World War II, the closing moral that rulers are careless of the suffering of others in fulfilling their ambition had special resonance.\n"}

{"id": "974396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=974396", "title": "Yucatec Maya language", "text": "Yucatec Maya language\n\nYucatec Maya (endonym: ; in the revised orthography of the ), called (lit. \"Maya speech\") by its speakers, is a Mayan language spoken in the Yucatán Peninsula and northern Belize. To native speakers, the proper name is Maya and it is known only as Maya. The qualifier \"Yucatec\" is a tag linguists use to distinguish it from other Mayan languages (such as K'iche' and Itza'). Thus the use of the term Yucatec Maya to refer to the language is scientific jargon or nomenclature.\n\nIn the Mexican states of Yucatán, some parts of Campeche, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Quintana Roo, Maya remains many speakers' first language today, with 800,000 speakers. There are 6,000 speakers in Belize.\n\nYucatec Maya forms part of the Yucatecan branch of the Mayan language family. The Yucatecan branch divides into the subgroups Mopan-itza and Yucatec-Lacandon, which in turn split into four languages: Itza, Mopan, Yucatec Maya, and Lacandon. All the languages in the Mayan language family are thought to originate from an ancestral language that was spoken some 5,000 years ago, known as Proto-Mayan.\n\nChristopher Columbus traded with Maya merchants off the coast of Yucatán in 1502, but never made landfall. Arriving in Yucatán during the decade following Columbus' first contact with the Maya, the first Spanish to set foot on Yucatán soil did so by chance, the survivors of a shipwreck in the Caribbean. Most of the shipwrecked men were sacrificed, leaving just two survivors. In 1519, one of these men (Gerónimo de Aguilar) accompanied Hernán Cortez to the Yucatán island of Cozumel, also taking part in the conquest of central Mexico. The other survivor (Gonzalo Guerrero) became a Mexican legend as father of the first Mestizo: by Aguilar’s account, Guerrero \"went native\"- he married native women, wore traditional native apparel, and even fought against the Spanish. Francisco de Montejo's military incursion of Yucatán took three generations and three wars of heavy fighting that lasted a total of 24 years.The Maya had been in a stable decline when Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1517 AD. From 200 to 800 AD the Maya were thriving and making great technological advances and created a system for recording numerals and hieroglyphs that was more complex and efficient than what had come before. They migrated Northward and Eastward to the Yucatán peninsula from Palenque, Jaina, and Bonampak. In the 12th and 13th centuries, a coalition emerged in the Yucatán peninsula between three important centers, Uxmal, Chichen Uitza, and Mayapan, where they were able to grow and practice intellectual and artistic achievement during a period of peace, but then war broke out and both intellectual and artistic achievements came to end. By the 15th century Mayan Toltec fell. In the 18th century the Spanish turned the lands to large maize and cattle plantations with luxurious haciendas and exported natural resources. The Maya were subjects of the Spanish Empire from 1542 to 1821.\n\nDuring the colonization of the Yucatán peninsula, the Spanish believed that in order to evangelize and govern the Maya they needed to reform Yucatec Maya and shape it to serve their ends of religious conversion and social control. Spanish missionaries undertook a project of linguistic and social transformation known as \"reducción\" (from Spanish \"reducir),\" a term not widely recognized by historians. The linguistic aspect of this process involved the reformulation of Yucatec Maya, primarily through the translation of religious texts from Spanish into Yucatec Maya and the creation of neologisms needed to express Catholic religious concepts. The result of the process of \"reducción\" was \"Maya reducido\", a semantically transformed version of Yucatec Maya. Along with the attempted eradication of all Maya religious practices and associated written works, the missionaries thus shaped a language that was used to convert, subjugate, and govern the Maya population of the Yucatán peninsula. Notwithstanding, \"Maya reducido\" was appropriated by its Maya speakers for their own purposes and served efforts to resist colonial domination. The oldest written records in Maya reducido (which used the Roman alphabet) were written by Maya notaries between 1557 and 1851. These works can be found in the United States, Mexico, and Spain in libraries and archives\n\nA characteristic feature of Yucatec Maya, like other Mayan languages, is the use of ejective consonants: . Often referred to as glottalized consonants, they are produced at the same place of oral articulation as their non-ejective stop counterparts: . However, the release of the lingual closure is preceded by a raising of the closed glottis to increase the air pressure in the space between the glottis and the point of closure, resulting in a release with a characteristic \"popping\" sound. The sounds are written using an apostrophe after the letter to distinguish them from the plain consonants (\"t'àan\" \"speech\" vs. \"táan\" \"forehead\"). The apostrophes indicating the sounds were not common in written Maya until the 20th century but are now becoming more common. The Mayan \"b\" is also glottalized, an implosive , and is sometimes written \"b',\" but that is becoming less common.\n\nYucatec Maya is one of only three Mayan languages to have developed tone, the others being Uspantek and one dialect of Tzotzil. Yucatec distinguishes short vowels and long vowels, indicated by single versus double letters (ii ee aa oo uu), and between high- and low-tone long vowels. High-tone vowels begin on a high pitch and fall in phrase-final position but rise elsewhere, sometimes without much vowel length. It is indicated in writing by an acute accent (íi ée áa óo úu). Low-tone vowels begin on a low pitch and are sustained in length; they are sometimes indicated in writing by a grave accent (ìi èe àa òo ùu).\n\nAlso, Yucatec has contrastive laryngealization (creaky voice) on long vowels, sometimes realized by means of a full intervocalic glottal stop and written as a long vowel with an apostrophe in the middle, as in the plural suffix \"-o'ob\".\n\nPhonology acquisition is received idiosyncratically. While one child seems to have severe difficulties with affricates and sibilants, another might have no difficulties with them but significant problems with sensitivity to semantic content, unlike the former child.\n\nThere seems to be no incremental development in phonology patterns. Monolingual children learning the language have shown acquisition of aspiration and deobstruentization but difficulty with sibilants and affricates, and other children show the reverse. Also, some children have been observed fronting palatoalveolars, others retract lamino-alveolars, and still others retract both.\n\nGlottalization was not found to be any more difficult than aspiration. That is significant with Yucatec Mayan languages' use of ejectives. Glottal constriction is high in the developmental hierarchy, and features like [fricative], [apical], or [fortis] are found to be later acquired.\n\n† the letter w may represent the sounds or . The sounds are interchangeable in Yucatec Mayan although is considered the proper sound.\n\nIn terms of vowel quality, Yucatec Maya has a straight-forward five vowel system:\n\nFor each of these five vowel qualities, the language contrasts four distinct vowel \"shapes\", i.e. combinations of length, tone, and phonation type. In the standard orthography first adopted in 1984, vowel length is indicated by digraphs (e.g. \"aa\" for IPA )\n\nLike almost all Mayan languages, Yucatec Maya is verb-initial. Word order varies between VOS and VSO, with VOS being the most common. Many sentences may appear to be SVO, but this order is due to a topic–comment system similar to that of Japanese. One of the most widely studied areas of Yucatec is the semantics of time in the language. Yucatec, like many other languages of the world (Kalaallisut, arguably Mandarin Chinese, Guaraní and others) does not have the grammatical category of tense. Temporal information is encoded by a combination of aspect, inherent lexical aspect (\"aktionsart\"), and pragmatically governed conversational inferences. Yucatec is unusual in lacking temporal connectives such as 'before' and 'after'. Another aspect of the language is the core-argument marking strategy, which is a 'fluid S system' in the typology of Dixon (1994) where intransitive subjects are encoded like agents or patients based upon a number of semantic properties as well as the perfectivity of the event.\n\nThe Maya were literate in pre-Columbian times, when the language was written using Maya script. The language itself can be traced back to proto-Yucatecan, the ancestor of modern Yucatec Maya, Itza, Lacandon and Mopan. Even further back, the language is ultimately related to all other Maya languages through proto-Mayan itself.\n\nYucatec Maya is now written in the Latin script. This was introduced during the Spanish Conquest of Yucatán which began in the early 16th century, and the now-antiquated conventions of Spanish orthography of that period (\"Colonial orthography\") were adapted to transcribe Yucatec Maya. This included the use of x for the postalveolar fricative sound (which is often written in English as sh), a sound that in Spanish has since turned into a velar fricative nowadays spelled j.\n\nIn colonial times a \"reversed c\" (ɔ) was often used to represent , which is now more usually represented with (and with in the revised ALMG orthography).\n\nYucatec-language programming is carried by the CDI's radio stations XEXPUJ-AM (Xpujil, Campeche), XENKA-AM (Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo) and XEPET-AM (Peto, Yucatán).\n\nThe 2006 film \"Apocalypto\", directed by Mel Gibson, was filmed entirely in Yucatec Maya. The script was translated into Maya by Hilario Chi Canul of the Maya community of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, who also worked as a language coach on the production.\n\nIn the video game \"\", Pacal, leader of the Maya, speaks in Yucatec Maya.\n\nIn August 2012, the Mozilla Translathon 2012 event brought over 20 Yucatec Mayan speakers together in a localization effort for the Google Endangered Languages Project, the Mozilla browser, and the MediaWiki software used by Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects.\n\nBaktun, the \"first ever Mayan telenovela,\" premiered in August 2013.\n\nJesús Pat Chablé is often credited with being one of the first Maya-language rappers and producers.\n\n\n\nIn addition to universities and private institutions in Mexico, (Yucatec) Maya is also taught at: \n\nFree online dictionary, grammar and texts:\n"}
