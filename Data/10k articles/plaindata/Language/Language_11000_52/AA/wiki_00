Jones suggested that fear of aphanisis was in both sexes more fundamental than castration anxiety, an argument he used against Sigmund Freud in their debate over female sexuality. Jones considered that the Oedipus complex confronted each sex with the threat of aphanisis, and the choice of giving up \"either their sex or their incest\".\n\nJones subsequently linked aphanisis to Freud's concept of the trauma of separation, a point taken up by John Bowlby in the context of his own theory of separation anxiety.\n\nLacan adapted Jones's term to a new meaning: \"\"aphanisis\" is to be situated in a more radical way at the level at which the subject manifests himself in this movement of disappearance...the \"fading\" of the subject\".\n\nIn Lacanian theory, aphanisis describes the process through which a subject is partially eclipsed behind any signifier used to conceive of him/her: \"when the subject appears somewhere as meaning, he is manifested elsewhere as 'fading', as disappearance...\"aphanisis\"\". The subject as such is, accordingly, barred and riven by the Other (of language), a subject has no choice but to conceive of themself \"vis-a-vis\" something other than their self, something 'outside' or radically separated from them. \n\nBecause the Other is the sole means through which a 'subject' can be rendered thinkable, aphanisis, the disappearance or the fading of the subject behind any signifier used to conceive of it, is an essential concept for understanding subjectivity and the peril of the subject's fundamental emptiness.\n\nŽižek developed the concept of aphanisis in terms of the dialectic of presence and absence—the gap between the core of the personality and the symbolic narrative in which the individual lives.\n\nMontaigne has been seen as a classic example of the exploration of the aphanisis of the subject.\n\n"}

Thus making the origins of borrowed and reborrowed words in the Bengali vocabulary numerous and diverse, due to centuries of contact with various languages.\n\nThe typical Bengali dictionary lists 75,000 separate words, of which 50,000 (67%) are considered তৎসম \"tôtsômô\" (words directly reborrowed from Sanskrit), 21,100 (28%) are তদ্ভব \"tôdbhôbô\" (native Bengali vocabulary with Sanskrit cognates), and the rest being borrowings from দেশী \"deshi\" \"indigenous (Austroasiatic)\" and বিদেশী \"bideshi\" \"foreign\" sources.\n\nHowever, these figures do not take into account the fact that a huge chunk of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimising their actual usage.

{"id": "4742076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4742076", "title": "Cartesian linguistics", "text": "Cartesian linguistics\n\nThe term Cartesian linguistics was coined with the publication of Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966), a book on linguistics by Noam Chomsky. The word \"Cartesian\" is the adjective pertaining to René Descartes, a prominent 17th-century philosopher. However, rather than confine himself to the works of Descartes, Chomsky surveys other authors interested in rationalist thought.\nIn particular, Chomsky discusses the \"Port-Royal Grammar\" (1660), a book which foreshadows some of his own ideas concerning universal grammar.\n\nChomsky traces the development of linguistic theory from Descartes to Wilhelm von Humboldt, that is, from the period of the Enlightenment directly up to Romanticism. The central doctrine of \"Cartesian Linguistics\" maintains that the general features of grammatical structure are common to all languages and reflect certain fundamental properties of the mind. The book was written with the purpose of deepening \"our understanding of the nature of language and the mental processes and structures that underlie its use and acquisition\".\nChomsky wished to shed light on these underlying structures of the human language, and subsequently whether one can infer the nature of an organism from its language.\n\nChomsky's book received mostly unfavorable reviews. Critics argued that \"Cartesian linguistics\" fails both as a methodological conception and as a historical phenomenon.\n\nCertain mechanical factors of language function, such as response to stimuli, are evident in both humans and animals; however, Chomsky cites several 17th-century Cartesian experiments that show that the \"creative\" aspect of language is specific only to human beings. This is, in essence, the Cartesian theory of language production.\n\nChomsky writes, \"one fundamental contribution of what we have been calling 'Cartesian linguistics' is the observation that human language, in its normal use, is free from the control of independently identifiable external stimuli or internal states and is not restricted to any practical communicative function, in contrast, for example, to the pseudo language of animals\". \"In short, animal 'language' remains completely within the bounds of mechanical explanation as this was conceived by Descartes and Cordemoy\" and the creative aspect of language is what separates humans and animals.\n\nPhilosophical undertones permeate Cartesian theory. One example of this is the idea that freedom from instinct and from stimulus control is the basis for what we call \"human reason\". Weakness of instinct is man's natural advantage, that which makes him a rational being. \"From this conception of language, it is only a short step to the association of the creative aspect of language use with true \"artistic\" creativity\". In other words, \"the 'poetical' quality of ordinary language derives from its independence of immediate stimulation and its freedom from practical ends\", essentially subject matter that correlates with Cartesian philosophy.\n\nChomsky parallels theories of Enlightenment thinkers Humboldt, Goethe, and Herder, holding them up as researchers who were seeking a universal order and to show the tendency of Cartesian thinking to diffuse into different areas of academia. Humboldt's effort to reveal the organic form of language, like many of the cited experiments, is placed into the context of modern linguistics to show the differences between the Cartesian model of linguistics and the modern model of linguistics, and to illustrate the contributions of the former to the latter.\n\nAnother aspect of this universality is generative grammar, a Chomskyan approach, which is one finite, ubiquitous aspect of language that provides the \"organic unity\" of which Humboldt wrote. Also Humboldtian is the idea that the forces generating language and thought are one and the same.\n\n\"Pursuing the fundamental distinction between body and mind, Cartesian linguistics characteristically assumes that language has two aspects\", namely, the sound/character of a linguistic sign and its significance. Semantic and phonetic interpretation may not be identical in Cartesian linguistics. Deep structures are often only represented in the mind (a mirror of thought), as opposed to surface structures, which are not.\n\nDeep structures vary less between languages than surface structures. For instance, the transformational operations yielding surface forms of Latin and French may obscure common features of their deep structures. Chomsky proposes, \"In many respects, it seems to me quite accurate, then, to regard the theory of transformational generative grammar, as it is developing in current work, as essentially a modern and more explicit version of the Port-Royal theory\".\n\nThe Port Royal Grammar is an often cited reference in \"Cartesian Linguistics\" and is considered by Chomsky to be a more than suitable example of Cartesian linguistic philosophy. \"A sentence has an inner mental aspect (a deep structure that conveys its meaning) and an outer, physical aspect as a sound sequence.\" This theory of deep and surface structures, developed in Port Royal linguistics, meets the formal requirements of language theory. Chomsky describes it in modern terms as \"a base system that generates deep structures and a transformational system that maps these into surface structures\", essentially a form of transformational grammar akin to modern theories.\n\nChomsky bridges the past with the present by stating that from the standpoint of modern linguistic theory, the characterization and discovery of deep structures is absurd, in accordance with the present study and quantification of such things as \"linguistic fact\" and \"sound-meaning correspondences\". In any case, traditional attempts to deal with deep and surface structure theory were unsuccessful.\n\nDescartes' idea of language is that it is a form of self-expression, not merely communication…Modern linguistics hasn't dealt with, or rather hasn't fully acknowledged, problems raised by Cartesian philosophy. They have been glossed over as unnecessary problems of a generally well-accepted theory.\n\nAnother aspect of Cartesian linguistics is the \"necessity for supplementing descriptive statements with a rational explanation\", in order to qualify as a true science. Chomsky claims that an excessive rationality and priorism were common to the Enlightenment period and that a great, underlying hypothesis as to the general nature of language is missing in the Cartesian analysis of deep structure.\n\nThese refer to the \"inborn capacitiies\" or a certain \"natural instinct\" that \"instructs us in the nature, manner, and scope of what is to be heard, hoped for, or desired\" (Cherbury). These latent notions are only activated through an outside stimulus. Chomsky asserts that this focus on innate and psychological doctrine as a precursor to experience and knowledge is typical of \"Cartesian\" linguistics, along with the requisite of an external stimulus for activation of the doctrine's latent function.\n\nWith this said, \"language acquisition is a matter of growth and maturation of relatively fixed capacities, under appropriate external conditions\". The 17th century's amenable approach to language learning was very non-conforming, as the overall perception was that knowledge arose on the basis of scattered, inadequate data. Properties conducive to what is learned were attributed to the mind. Theories of perception and learning were essentially the same, though it was an acknowledged difference that would consequently become indistinct during acquisition.\n\n\"Thus prior knowledge and set play a large role in determining what we see\" (Cudworth [Treatise on Morality] 423-424)\nA common idea/perception was that an object/idea could be stamped upon the soul upon the occasion of an idea excited from the comprehensive power of the intellect itself. Only Humboldt, who was a living connection between the rationalist Enlightenment and the Romantic period, devised the underlying generative system of language perception . Again, Chomsky asserts that \"contemporary research in perception has returned to the investigation of internally represented schemata...\". The current work of modern linguistics continues the tradition of \"Cartesian\" linguistics in transformational grammar.\n\nChomsky formulates fundamental conclusions of Cartesian linguistics in his studies.\n\nChomsky accomplished his research for \"Cartesian Linguistics\" while he was a fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies; thereafter a great deal of subject matter was presented at the Christian Gauss seminars at Princeton University in 1965. Since the publication of \"Cartesian Linguistics\", Chomsky's history has been criticized as an artificial predecessor to his own ideas, mainly formulated in the context of 1950s psychological behaviorism.\n\nChomsky replied to his critics and defended the validity of his conception by further elaborating his historical perspective. The book was re-edited by James McGilvray in 2002 and 2009 with only minor changes and lengthy introductions. New reviews invariably point to previous criticism which had been left unanswered, suggesting that the introductory essays also failed to convince.\n\nThe main objection to the book's argument bears on the point that, for his \"Cartesian linguistics\", Chomsky relies mostly on the Port-Royal grammar and not on Descartes' writings. However, the grammar is not Cartesian in any interesting sense. The whole discussion was succinctly summarized in 1969: \"Professor Chomsky may wish to cling to the term \"Cartesian linguistics\" for reasons not fully explicit in his book, although his remarks on the use of such a label suggest that he means simply 'rationalist linguistics.' But if he wishes to include under his label the Cartesian notion of language as species-specific to man, and the notion of underlying structures (which I argue is not Cartesian in origin), as well as the general rational approach, he can do no better than to use the term 'Port-Royal linguistics'.\"\n\n"}

The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers.\n\nFrequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies. Moreover, there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language. For instance, given a section of English language, E, T, A and O are the most common, while Z, Q and X are rare. Likewise, TH, ER, ON, and AN are the most common pairs of letters (termed \"bigrams\" or \"digraphs\"), and SS, EE, TT, and FF are the most common repeats. The nonsense phrase \"ETAOIN SHRDLU\" represents the 12 most frequent letters in typical English language text.\n\nIn some ciphers, such properties of the natural language plaintext are preserved in the ciphertext, and these patterns have the potential to be exploited in a ciphertext-only attack.\n\nIn a simple substitution cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another, and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext. For instance, if all occurrences of the letter e turn into the letter X, a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter X would suggest to a cryptanalyst that X represents e.\n\nThe basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them. More Xs in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that X corresponds to e in the plaintext, but this is not certain; t and a are also very common in English, so X might be either of them also. It is unlikely to be a plaintext z or q which are less common. Thus the cryptanalyst may need to try several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and plaintext letters.\n\nMore complex use of statistics can be conceived, such as considering counts of pairs of letters (\"bigrams\"), triplets (\"trigrams\"), and so on. This is done to provide more information to the cryptanalyst, for instance, Q and U nearly always occur together in that order in English, even though Q itself is rare.\n\nSuppose Eve has intercepted the cryptogram below, and it is known to be encrypted using a simple substitution cipher as follows: \nFor this example, uppercase letters are used to denote ciphertext, lowercase letters are used to denote plaintext (or guesses at such), and X~t is used to express a guess that ciphertext letter X represents the plaintext letter t.\n\nEve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines: counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that I is the most common single letter, XL most common bigram, and XLI is the most common trigram. e is the most common letter in the English language, th is the most common bigram, and the is the most common trigram. This strongly suggests that X~t, L~h and I~e. The second most common letter in the cryptogram is E; since the first and second most frequent letters in the English language, e and t are accounted for, Eve guesses that E~a, the third most frequent letter. Tentatively making these assumptions, the following partial decrypted message is obtained.\n\nUsing these initial guesses, Eve can spot patterns that confirm her choices, such as \"that\". Moreover, other patterns suggest further guesses. \"Rtate\" might be \"state\", which would mean R~s. Similarly \"atthattMZe\" could be guessed as \"atthattime\", yielding M~i and Z~m. Furthermore, \"heVe\" might be \"here\", giving V~r. Filling in these guesses, Eve gets:\n\nIn turn, these guesses suggest still others (for example, \"remarA\" could be \"remark\", implying A~k) and so on, and it is relatively straightforward to deduce the rest of the letters, eventually yielding the plaintext.\n\nAt this point, it would be a good idea for Eve to insert spaces and punctuation:\n\nIn this example from The Gold-Bug, Eve's guesses were all correct. This would not always be the case, however; the variation in statistics for individual plaintexts can mean that initial guesses are incorrect. It may be necessary to backtrack incorrect guesses or to analyze the available statistics in much more depth than the somewhat simplified justifications given in the above example.\n\nIt is also possible that the plaintext does not exhibit the expected distribution of letter frequencies. Shorter messages are likely to show more variation. It is also possible to construct artificially skewed texts. For example, entire novels have been written that omit the letter \"e\" altogether — a form of literature known as a lipogram.\n\nThe first known recorded explanation of frequency analysis (indeed, of any kind of cryptanalysis) was given in the 9th century by Al-Kindi, an Arab polymath, in \"A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages\". It has been suggested that close textual study of the Qur'an first brought to light that Arabic has a characteristic letter frequency. Its use spread, and similar systems were widely used in European states by the time of the Renaissance. By 1474, Cicco Simonetta had written a manual on deciphering encryptions of Latin and Italian text. Arabic Letter Frequency and a detailed study of letter and word frequency analysis of the entire book of Qur'an are provided by Intellaren Articles.\n\nSeveral schemes were invented by cryptographers to defeat this weakness in simple substitution encryptions. These included:\n\n\nA disadvantage of all these attempts to defeat frequency counting attacks is that it increases complication of both enciphering and deciphering, leading to mistakes. Famously, a British Foreign Secretary is said to have rejected the Playfair cipher because, even if school boys could cope successfully as Wheatstone and Playfair had shown, \"our attachés could never learn it!\".\n\nThe rotor machines of the first half of the 20th century (for example, the Enigma machine) were essentially immune to straightforward frequency analysis.\nHowever, other kinds of analysis (\"attacks\") successfully decoded messages from some of those machines.\nFrequency analysis requires only a basic understanding of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During World War II (WWII), both the British and the Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers used by the Axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis, for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army's SIS. Today, the hard work of letter counting and analysis has been replaced by computer software, which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.\n\nFrequency analysis has been described in fiction. Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Gold-Bug\", and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes tale \"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\" are examples of stories which describe the use of frequency analysis to attack simple substitution ciphers. The cipher in the Poe story is encrusted with several deception measures, but this is more a literary device than anything significant cryptographically.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15101111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15101111", "title": "Host media processing", "text": "Host media processing\n\nA telephony system based on host media processing (HMP) is one that uses a general-purpose computer to process a telephony call’s media stream rather than using digital signal processors (DSPs) to perform the task. When telephony call streams started to be digitized for time-division-multiplexed (TDM) transport, processing of the media stream, to enhance it in some way, became common. For example, digital echo cancellers were added to long-haul circuits, and transport channels were shaped to improve modem performance. Then, in the mid-‘80s, computer-based systems that implemented messaging, for example, used DSPs to compress the audio for storage, and fax servers used DSPs to implement fax modems.\n\nHowever, since the late ‘90s, the millions of instructions per second (MIPS) of processing power available on low-cost PCs have been adequate to process several media streams, while still leaving enough processing power to handle the application. And, following Moore’s Law, PC capacity continues to double every 18 months, while the MIPS required to process a call’s media stream have remained relatively constant. Now, in the latter half of the century’s first decade, a single PC can handle well over 100 simultaneous calls.\n\nPrior to IP telephony, when you wanted to connect a telecommunications system to a telecom network it was necessary to have a telecom-specific physical interface. This could mean an analog interface (POTS/DS-0), for low-density non-network systems, or a digital interface, such as a T-1 or E-1 line (DS-1, delivering 24 or 32 DS-0s). A DS-4 connection delivers 274.176 Mbit/s or 4032 DS-Os. In each case, telecom-specific electronic interfaces, which were proprietary and, therefore, relatively expensive, were necessary. The situation changes dramatically with an all-IP telecom infrastructure. The network interfaces move from being a significant proprietary component to off-the-shelf high-performance IP interfaces, an inherent feature in every modern computing system. Today, 10-Gigabit Ethernet' telephony systems are being deployed.\n\nThe term Host Media Processing was first used in a product name by Intel in the early 2000s. It was quickly adopted as a generic term for software-based telephony products, used by many companies including Aculab, Pika, Eicon Networks, Uniqall, Commetrex, and NMS. Intel's Host Media Processing product line (still called HMP) exists today under the Dialogic banner.\n\nThe concept of using an industry standard PC to do telephony processing is now widely understood and accepted, with open-source platforms like Asterisk, YATE and FreeSWITCH using the same principle. The rise of interest in VoIP and Fax-over-IP (FoIP) have driven demand for open, host-based solutions that can be molded into a variety of different communications solutions. HMP components are used today to implement many different kinds of solutions including PBX, conference servers, unified communications servers and IVR. The emergence of virtualization in recent years also increases the appeal of HMP, since it is then possible to think of telephony resources as being virtual channels (rather than dedicated hardware boards), which offer the same benefit as virtual processors and servers, i.e. resilience; less hardware; space saving; lower maintenance.\n\nNetwork connectivity through low-cost industry-standard interfaces influences the consideration of whether to use DSPs or server blades for media processing, especially in media servers, where packet-delays are not as troublesome and TDM interfaces are not required. Without telephony interface blades and their attendant chassis and power systems available to host the DSPs, the addition of DSPs on proprietary blades must be independently justified. They will continue to be justified for the highest-density applications. However, with the semiconductor industry continuing to follow Moore’s law, host media processing will support 1500 channels on one blade in 2010. DSPs will always offer even higher densities, but if 1500 channels meets the system requirement, higher densities will have little incremental value.\n\nNot every use of the term “HMP” means the same thing. There are, for example, HMP systems that do no actual media processing, so it is important to understand how the term is being used today.\n\nModern digital-media telephony systems require signal processing to transform a call stream or extract information from it. Transformation includes the processing required to send or receive a fax and to transcode the stream from one speech codec to another for capability matching or bandwidth reduction. DTMF detection, caller ID, and in-band call-progress analysis are good examples of information extraction.\n\nThere are many limited-function media servers on the market that don’t actually do any media (signal) processing. There is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) “RFC” (2833) that defines how a gateway can perform the in-band-tone analysis to extract some of the embedded information, such as DTMF and caller ID. In this case, all the media server need do is parse the RTP buffers from a gateway to derive the tone information.\n\nBut what about transcoding, where one voice-compression scheme (vocoder) it transcoded to another? Some media servers, for example, simply process buffers, and, therefore, cannot perform any transcoding, limiting them to low-function voice messaging. RTP packets are simply stored and played back as they are received. This means no AGC, volume control, time-scale modification (playback speedup and slowdown), or capabilities matching with endpoint terminals, making this type of so-called HMP media server a viable option only in the most functionally constrained applications.\n\nFor years, the terms “signal processing” and “media processing” have been used interchangeably, so, most appropriately, the term HMP is reserved for those systems where host MIPS are actually used to perform digital signal-processing tasks.\n\n"}
{"id": "26450590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26450590", "title": "Imaging biomarker", "text": "Imaging biomarker\n\nAn imaging biomarker is a biologic feature, or biomarker detectable in an image. In medicine, an imaging biomarker is a feature of an image relevant to a patient's diagnosis. For example, a number of biomarkers are frequently used to determine risk of lung cancer. First, a simple lesion in the lung detected by X-ray, CT, or MRI can lead to the suspicion of a neoplasm. The lesion itself serves as a biomarker, but the minute details of the lesion serve as biomarkers as well, and can collectively be used to assess the risk of neoplasm. Some of the imaging biomarkers used in lung nodule assessment include size, spiculation, calcification, cavitation, location within the lung, rate of growth, and rate of metabolism. Each piece of information from the image represents a probability. Spiculation increases the probability of the lesion being cancer. A slow rate of growth indicates benignity. These variables can be added to the patient's history, physical exam, laboratory tests, and pathology to reach a proposed diagnosis. Imaging biomarkers can be measured using several techniques, such as CT, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and MRI.\n\nImaging biomarkers are as old as the X-ray itself. A feature of a radiograph that represent some kind of pathology was first coined \"Roentgen signs\" after Wilhelm Röntgen, the discoverer of the X-ray. As the field of medical imaging developed and expanded to include numerous imaging modalities, imaging biomarkers have grown as well, in both quantity and complexity as finally in chemical imaging.\n\nA quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIB) is \"an objective characteristic derived from an in vivo image measured on a ratio or interval scale as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or a response to a therapeutic intervention\". advantage of QIB's over qualitative imaging biomarkers is that they are better suited to be used for follow-up of patients or in clinical trials. Examples of a frequently used QIB are the RECIST criteria, measuring the evolution in tumor size to assess treatment response for patients with cancer, the Nuchal scan used for prenatal screening, or the assessment of lesion load and brain atrophy for patients with multiple sclerosis.\n\nClinical trials are known to be one of the most valuable sources of data in evidence-based medicine. For a pharmaceutical, device, or procedure to be approved for regular use in the U.S., it must be rigorously tested in clinical trials, and demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Unfortunately clinical trials are also extremely expensive and time consuming. End-points, such as morbidity and mortality, are used as measures to compare groups within a clinical trial. The most basic endpoint used in clinical trials, mortality, requires years and sometimes decades of follow-up to sufficiently assess. Morbidity, although potentially faster to measure than mortality, can also be a very difficult endpoint to measure clinically, as it is often very subjective. These are some of the reasons why biomarkers have been increasingly used in clinical trials to detect subtle changes in physiology and pathology before they can are detected clinically. The biomarkers act as surrogate endpoints. The use of surrogate endpoints has been shown to significantly decrease the time and resources used in clinical trials. Because surrogate end-points allow researchers to assess a marker rather than the patient, it allows participants to act as their own control, and in many cases allows for easier blinding.\n\nIn addition to surrogate endpoints, imaging biomarkers can be used as \"predictive classifiers\", to assist in selecting appropriate candidates for particular treatment. Predictive classifiers are frequently used in molecular imaging in order to ensure enzymatic response to treatment.\n\nThe United States Congress and the Food and Drug Administration have acknowledged the value of imaging biomarkers as evidenced by recent actions that encourage their use. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 was instituted to improve the regulatory process for medical products. Section 112 of the Act gives explicit authority to give expedited approval for drugs that treat serious conditions as long as it has shown to have an effect on a surrogate end-point that reasonably indicates a clinical benefit. Other provisions enables monitoring of the products following market approval to ensure the efficacy of the surrogate end-points and requires the FDA to establish a program that promotes the development and use of surrogate end-points for serious diseases. Although the act does not specifically mention the use of surrogate end-points for medical devices, section 205 requires that the \"least burdensome means necessary\" be used in their approval. The wording is much more general than the provision for pharmaceuticals, but is generally accepted that surrogate endpoints will often qualify as being the \"least burdensome means\".\n\nDeveloping an understanding of clinical significance for specific biomarkers can be a difficult process. There are two steps of certification for a surrogate endpoint to be fully established: Qualification and Validation. For a biomarker to become qualified it must go through a somewhat formal qualification process. A request must be submitted to IPRG to qualify an imaging biomarker for a specific use. The Biomarker Qualification Review Team, recruited from nonclinical and clinical review divisions, assesses the context and available data regarding the biomarker. They also evaluate the qualification study strategy methods and results and ultimately make a decision to accept or reject. After qualification, a biomarker may have limited use as a surrogate endpoint. They may be used in phase I and II clinical trials, but can only be used in phase III trials for early futility analyses.\n\nThere are two steps to validation, probable validation and known validation. \"Probable validation\" requires widespread agreement in the medical or scientific community as to its efficacy. \"Known validation\" requires a scientific framework or body of evidence that appears to elucidate the marker’s efficacy. For full validation, a biomarker must demonstrate that the treatment versus control differences are similar to the treatment versus control differences for clinical outcome. It is not sufficient to simply demonstrate that the biomarker responders survive longer than the biomarker non-responders.\n\nThe following are 3 measures of quality to determine the strength of biomarker for use in clinical trials.\n\n\nBecause the project of compiling a library of validated biomarkers requires an enormous amount of resources, the FDA has encouraged the creation of consortia between public and private organization in order to facilitate the sharing of data for the qualification and validation of biomarkers.\n\nThe Biomarkers Consortium was created by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Health, Food and Drug Administration, and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. It is a public-private biomedical research partnership aimed to provide grants for the generation of data for clinical biomarker qualification.\n\nThe Predictive Safety Testing Consortium, was created by the Critical Path Institute and the Food and Drug Administration to develop a framework needed for data sharing between its members in order to make biomarker qualification easier. They are also working with regulatory agencies to replace the currently unstructured qualification process.\n\nIn 2001, the Radiology department at Massachusetts General Hospital, founded the MGH Center for Biomarkers in Imaging, a center dedicated to encourage the development and use of imaging biomarkers. Their initial project was to catalogue the known biomarkers in order to make them readily available to scientists, regulators, and industry representatives (now available on their website). The catalogue includes the pathology specific to the biomarkers, the investigator(s) involved in creating and using the biomarker, and the modalities used in the detection of the biomarker.\n\nInternational Cancer Biomarker Consortium was created to assist in discovery of biomarkers by facilitating coordinated research and by leveraging resources. Each international team chooses a cancer site(s) for study, functions independently, and secures its own funding. The president of the organization, Leland Hartwell, is a nobel prize winner for physiology/medicine in 2001.\n\nUniform Protocols for Imaging in Clinical Trials (UPICT) was created by the American College of Radiology.\n\nImaging Response Assessment Teams was created by the National Cancer Institute and AACI to advance the role of imaging in assessment of response to therapy and to increase the application of quantitative, anatomic, functional, and molecular imaging endpoints in clinical therapeutic trials. Aims to strengthen clinical collaboration between imaging scientists and oncologic investigators.\n\nOncology Biomarker Qualification Initiative was created by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute to qualify new cancer biomarkers. Their first project involves PET imaging in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n"}

{"id": "4078573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4078573", "title": "Juana Maria", "text": "Juana Maria\n\nJuana Maria (died October 19, 1853), better known to history as the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island (her Native American name is unknown), was a Native American woman who was the last surviving member of her tribe, the Nicoleño. She lived alone on San Nicolas Island off the coast of California from 1835 until her rescue in 1853. Scott O'Dell's award-winning children's novel \"Island of the Blue Dolphins\" (1960) was inspired by her story. She was the last native speaker of the Nicoleño language.\n\nThe Channel Islands have long been inhabited by humans, with Native American colonization occurring 10,000 years ago or earlier. At the time of European contact, two distinct ethnic groups occupied the archipelago: the Chumash lived on the Northern Channel Islands and the Tongva on the Southern Islands (Juana Maria's tribe, the Nicoleño, were Tongva). In the early 1540s Portuguese conquistador Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo explored the California coast, claiming it on behalf of Spain. \nIn 1814, a party of Native Alaskan otter hunters working for the Russian-American Company (RAC), massacred most of the islanders after accusing them of killing a Native Alaskan hunter.\n\nAlthough there was speculation that the Franciscan padres of the California missions requested that the remaining Nicoleños be removed from the island, there is no documentary evidence to back that claim. The missions were undergoing secularization in the 1830s and there was no Franciscan priest at Mission San Gabriel from mid-1835 through spring of 1836 to receive any Nicoleños brought to the mainland. In late November 1835, the schooner \"Peor es Nada\", commanded by Charles Hubbard, left southern California to remove the remaining people living on San Nicolas. Upon arriving at the island, Hubbard's party, which included Isaac Sparks, gathered the Indians on the beach and brought them aboard. Juana Maria, however, was not among them by the time a strong storm arose, and the \"Peor es Nada\"'s crew, realizing the imminent danger of being wrecked by the surf and rocks, panicked and sailed toward the mainland, leaving her behind. A more romantic version tells of Juana Maria diving overboard after realizing her younger brother had been left behind, although archaeologist Steven J. Schwartz notes, \"The story of her jumping overboard does not show up until the 1880s ... By then the Victorian era is well underway, and literature takes on a flowery, even romantic flavor.\" This version is recorded by Juana Maria's eventual rescuer, George Nidever, who heard it from a hunter who had been on the \"Peor es Nada\"; however, Nidever makes it clear he may be misremembering what he heard.\n\nAccording to Emma Hardacre, there are differing accounts as to the discovery of the Lone Woman. The first being that Father José González Rubio of the Santa Barbara Mission offered a man named Carl Dittman $100 to find her. The second and what appears to be the original account from George Nidever states Father José González Rubio paid one Thomas Jeffries $200 to find Juana Maria, though he was unsuccessful. However, the tales Jeffries told upon returning managed to capture the imagination of George Nidever, a Santa Barbara fur trapper, who launched several expeditions of his own. His first two attempts failed to find her, but on his third attempt in the autumn of 1853, one of Nidever's men, Carl Dittman, discovered human footprints on the beach and pieces of seal blubber which had been left out to dry. Further investigation led to the discovery of Juana Maria, who was living on the island in a crude hut partially constructed of whale bones. She was dressed in a skirt made of greenish cormorant feathers. It was believed that she also lived in a nearby cave.\n\nAfterwards, Juana Maria was taken to the Santa Barbara Mission, but was only able to communicate with the three or four remaining members of her tribe. The local Chumash Indians could not understand her, so the mission sent for a group of Tongva who had formerly lived on Santa Catalina Island, but they were unsuccessful as well. Four words and two songs recorded from Juana Maria suggest she spoke one of the Uto-Aztecan languages native to Southern California, but it is not clear to which branch it is related. A University of California, Los Angeles study by linguist Pamela Munro focusing on the words and songs suggests that her language was most similar to those of the Luiseños of Northern San Diego County and of the Juaneños near San Juan Capistrano. Both groups traded with the San Nicolas islanders and their languages may have had some influence. This evidence, when taken as a whole, suggests that Juana Maria was a native Nicoleño.\n\nJuana Maria was reportedly fascinated and ecstatic upon arrival, marveling at the sight of horses, along with European clothing and food. She was allowed to stay with Nidever, who described her as a woman of \"medium height, but rather thick ... She must have been about 50 years old, but she was still strong and active. Her face was pleasing as she was continually smiling. Her teeth were entire but worn to the gums.\"\n\nJuana Maria apparently enjoyed visits by curious Santa Barbara residents, singing and dancing for her audiences. One of the songs Juana Maria sang is popularly called the \"Toki Toki\" song. Knowledge of this song came from a Ventureño man named Malquiares, an otter hunter who had joined Nidever's expedition to the island and who had heard Juana Maria sing it. Malquiares later recited the words to his friend Fernando Kitsepawit Librado (1839–1915). The song's words are as follows:\n\nLibrado recited the words to a Cruzeño Indian named Aravio Talawiyashwit, who translated them as \"I live contented because I can see the day when I want to get out of this island;\" however, given the lack of any other information on Juana Maria's language, this translation's accuracy is dubious, or perhaps was an intuitive guess. Anthropologist and linguist John Peabody Harrington recorded Librado singing the song on a wax cylinder in 1913.\n\nThe following text was published by an anonymous writer in Sacramento's \"Daily Democratic State Journal\" on October 13, 1853:\n\nThe wild woman who was found on the island of San Nicolas about 70 miles from the coast, west of Santa Barbara, is now at the latter place and is looked upon as a curiosity. It is stated she has been some 18 to 20 years alone on the island. She existed on shell fish and the fat of the seal, and dressed in the skins and feathers of wild ducks, which she sewed together with sinews of the seal. She cannot speak any known language, is good-looking and about middle age. She seems to be contented in her new home among the good people of Santa Barbara.\n\nJust seven weeks after arriving on the mainland, Juana Maria died of dysentery in Garey, California. Nidever claimed her fondness for green corn, vegetables and fresh fruit after years of little such nutrient-laden food caused the severe and ultimately fatal illness. Before she died, Father Sanchez baptized and christened her with the Spanish name Juana Maria. She was buried in an unmarked grave on the Nidever family plot at the Santa Barbara Mission cemetery. Father González Rubio made the following entry in the Mission's Book of Burials: \"On October 19, 1853 I gave ecclesiastical burial in the cemetery to the remains of Juana Maria, the Indian woman brought from San Nicolas Island and, since there was no one who could understand her language, she was baptized conditionally by Fr. Sanchez.\" In 1928, a plaque commemorating her was placed at the site by the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nJuana Maria's water basket, clothing and various artifacts, including bone needles which had been brought back from the island, were part of the collections of the California Academy of Sciences, but were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. Her cormorant feather dress was apparently sent to the Vatican, but it appears to have been lost.\n\nIn 1939, archaeologists discovered Juana Maria's whale-bone hut on the northernmost end of San Nicolas, the highest point of the island. The location of the hut exactly matched the descriptions left by Nidever. In 2012, archaeologist Steven J. Schwartz reported finding a site that may have been Juana Maria's cave. In 2009, University of Oregon archaeologist Jon Erlandson found two Nicoleño-style redwood boxes eroding from a sea cliff, covered by a whale rib and associated with several asphaltum-coated woven water bottles, and threatened with destruction from winter storms. The site is located on the northwest coast of San Nicolas, where Juana Maria is believed to have spent much of her time. The boxes, salvaged by Erlandson, René Vellanoweth, Lisa Thomas-Barnett, and Troy Davis, contained more than 200 artifacts, including bird-bone pendants, abalone shell dishes and fish hooks, soapstone ornaments, sandstone abraders, red ochre, a Nicoleño harpoon tip, glass projectile points and metal artifacts, and several Native Alaskan toggling harpoon tips. In 2012, Navy archaeologist Steven Schwartz, working with Vellanoweth and his students from California State University, Los Angeles, found and uncovered the buried remnants of the long-lost Indian Cave, where Juana Maria may also have lived. Archaeological research at the cave has been halted, however, at the request of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians, which claims cultural affiliation with the island's ancient residents.\n\nScott O'Dell's \"Island of the Blue Dolphins\" was largely based on Juana Maria's story. The novel's protagonist, Karana, endures many of the trials that Juana Maria must have faced while alone on San Nicolas. In the 1964 film version of the novel, American actress Celia Kaye played Karana.\n\n"}

Such greetings signify a wish and blessing that peace be with the recipient, and besides their spontaneous uses they have certain ritualized or formalized uses long established in liturgy. Many denominations use other forms of greeting (besides literal kisses) to serve equivalent purposes; they include handshakes, gestures, and hugs, any of which may be called a sign of peace. \n\nIt was the widespread custom in the ancient western Mediterranean for men to greet each other with a kiss. That was also the custom in ancient Judea and practiced also by Christians.\n\nHowever, the New Testament's references to a holy kiss (, \"en philemati hagio\") and kiss of love (\"en philemati agapēs\") transformed the character of the act beyond a greeting. Such a kiss is mentioned five times in the concluding section of letters in the New Testament:\n\n\nIt has been noted that these mentions of the holy kiss come at the end of these epistles. Since these epistles were addressed to Christian communities they would most probably have been read in the context of their communal worship. If the assemblies for worship already concluded in a celebration of the Eucharist the holy kiss would already have occurred in the position it would later occupy in most ancient Christian liturgical tradition (with the exception of the Roman Rite), namely after the proclamation of the Word and at the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist.\n\nThe writings of the early church fathers speak of the holy kiss, which they call \"a sign of peace\", which was already part of the Eucharistic liturgy, occurring after the Lord's Prayer in the Roman Rite and the rites directly derived from it. St. Augustine, for example, speaks of it in one of his Easter Sermons: \n\nAugustine's Sermon 227 is just one of several early Christian primary sources, both textual and iconographic (i.e., in works of art) providing clear evidence that the \"kiss of peace\" as practiced in the Christian liturgy was customarily exchanged for the first several centuries, not mouth to cheek, but mouth to mouth (note that men were separated from women during the liturgy) for, as the primary sources also show, this is how early Christians believed Christ and his followers exchanged their own kiss. For example, In his \"Paschale carmen\" (ca. 425-50), Latin priest-poet Sedulius condemns Judas and his betrayal of Christ with a kiss thus, \"And leading that sacrilegious mob with its menacing swords and spikes, you press your mouth against his, and infuse your poison into his honey?\" The kiss of peace was known in Greek from an early date as \"eirḗnē\" () (\"peace\", which became \"pax\" in Latin and peace in English). The source of the peace greeting is probably from the common Hebrew greeting shalom; and the greeting \"Peace be with you\" is similarly a translation of the Hebrew shalom aleichem. In the Gospels, both greetings were used by Jesus - e.g. ; , . The Latin term translated as \"sign of peace\" is simply \"pax\" (\"peace\"), not \"signum pacis\" (\"sign of peace\") nor \"osculum pacis\" (\"kiss of peace\"). So the invitation by the deacon, or in his absence by the priest, \"Let us offer each other the sign of peace\", is in Latin: \"Offerte vobis pacem\" (\"Offer each other peace\" or \"Offer each other the peace\").\n\nFrom an early date, to guard against any abuse of this form of salutation, women and men were required to sit separately, and the kiss of peace was given only by women to women and by men to men.\n\nThe practice remains a part of the worship in traditional churches, including the Episcopal Church,Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodox churches, Oriental Orthodox churches; some liturgical mainline Protestant denominations; and Spiritual Christian, where it is often called the kiss of peace, sign of peace, Holy kiss or simply peace or pax; It is practiced as a part of worship in many Anabaptist heritage groups including Old German Baptist Brethren, and Apostolic Christian.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, the term now used is not \"the kiss of peace\", but \"the sign of peace\" or \"the rite of peace\". The \"General Instruction of the Roman Missal\" states: \"There follows the Rite of Peace, by which the Church entreats peace and unity for herself and for the whole human family, and the faithful express to each other their ecclesial communion and mutual charity before communicating in the Sacrament.\" The priest says or sings: \"The peace of the Lord be with you always\", to which the people respond: \"And with your spirit.\" Then, as stated in the Roman Missal, \"if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds: 'Let us offer each other the sign of peace.'\"\n\nIn the Roman Rite, it is placed after the Pater Noster and before the Fractio Panis. Even within the Catholic Church, there are liturgical rites (the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite) in which it is placed after the Liturgy of the Word, before the gifts for consecration are put on the altar. The latter placing is influenced by the recommendation in about seeking reconciliation with another before completing an offering at the altar. It was a practice in Rome itself at the time of Justin Martyr in the middle of the 2nd century. In the 3rd century the present placing was chosen not only in Rome but also in other parts of the West such as Roman Africa, where Saint Augustine understood it as related to the petition, \"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\", in the Lord's Prayer and to the link between being in communion with the body of Christ understood as the Church and receiving communion with the body of Christ in the Eucharist.\n\nIn the Tridentine Mass form of the Roman Rite, the sign of peace is given at Solemn Masses alone and is exchanged only among the clergy (unless emperors, kings or princes were present, in which case they, too, received the greeting. If several members of a royal family were present, at least the sovereign received the greeting). It is given by extending both arms in a slight embrace with the words \"Pax tecum\" (Peace be with you), first by the priest celebrant to the deacon, who in turn gives it to the subdeacon, who gives the sign to any other clergy present in choir dress.\n\nIn the Roman-Rite revised in 1969, the sign of peace is used at most Masses but is not obligatory. It is exchanged between all present in no prescribed order, except that \"the Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister\". The manner prescribed is as follows: \"It is appropriate that each one give the sign of peace only to those who are nearest and in a sober manner. The Priest may give the sign of peace to the ministers but always remains within the sanctuary, so as not to disturb the celebration. He does likewise if for a just reason he wishes to extend the sign of peace to some few of the faithful.\"\n\nThe following are considered abuses by the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments:\n\nThe gesture by which the sign of peace is exchanged is to be determined by the local episcopal conference. In some countries, such as the United States, the conference has laid down no rules, and the everyday handshake is generally used, while in other countries, such as India and Thailand, a bow is prescribed. A 2014 letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments recommended that conferences choose gestures more appropriate than \"familiar and profane gestures of greeting\".\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church's Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the exchange of the peace occurs at the midpoint of the service, when the scripture readings have been completed and the Eucharistic prayers are yet to come. The priest announces, \"Let us love one another that with one accord we may confess--\" and the people conclude the sentence, \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in essence and undivided.\" At that point the Kiss of Peace is exchanged by clergy at the altar, and in some churches among the laity as well (the custom is being reintroduced, but is not universal). Immediately after the peace, the deacon cries \"The doors! The doors!\"; in ancient times, the catechumens and other non-members of the church would depart at this point, and the doors would be shut behind them. At that, worshippers then recite the Nicene Creed. In the Eastern Orthodox Liturgy, the Kiss of Peace is preparation for the Creed: \"Let us love one another that we may confess...the Trinity.\"\n\nIn the early centuries the kiss of peace was exchanged between the clergy: clergy kissing the bishop, lay men kissing laymen, and women kissing the women, according to the Apostolic Constitutions. Today the kiss of love is exchanged between concelebrating priests. Such has been the case for centuries. In a few Orthodox dioceses in the world in the last few decades, the kiss of peace between laymen has attempted to be reinstituted, usually as a handshake, hugging or cheek kissing.\n\nAnother example of an exchange of the peace is when, during the Divine Liturgy, the Priest declares to the people \"Peace be with all\", and their reply: \"And with your Spirit\". More examples of this practice may be found within Eastern Orthodoxy, but these are the most prominent examples.\n\nIn the Anglican church it is common practice at more formal services for the congregation to be invited to \"offer one another a sign of peace\". However, this is usually a handshake although married couples may kiss one another instead.\n\nDifferent Protestant and Reformed churches have readopted the holy kiss either metaphorically (in that members extend a pure, warm welcome that is referred to as a \"holy kiss\") or literally (in that members kiss one another). This practice is particularly important among many Anabaptist sects.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1898028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1898028", "title": "Languages of Italy", "text": "Languages of Italy\n\nThere are approximately thirty-four native living spoken languages and related dialects in Italy, most of which are indigenous evolutions of Vulgar Latin, and are therefore classified as Romance languages. Although they are sometimes referred to as regional languages, there is no uniformity within any Italian region, and speakers from one locale within a region are typically aware of the features distinguishing their local tongue from the one of other places nearby. The official and most widely spoken language across the country is Standard Italian, a direct descendant of Tuscan.\n\nAlmost all the Romance languages native to Italy, with the notable exception of Italian, are often colloquially referred to as \"dialects\", although for some of them the term may coexist with other labels like \"minority languages\" or \"vernaculars\". However, the use of the term \"dialect\" to refer to the languages of Italy may erroneously imply that the languages spoken in Italy are actual \"dialects\" of Standard Italian in the prevailing linguistic sense of \"varieties or variations of a language\". This is not the case regarding the longstanding languages of Italy, as they are not varieties of Italian. Most of the local Romance languages of Italy predate Italian and evolved locally from Vulgar Latin, independently of what would become the national language, long before the fairly recent spread of Italian throughout Italy. In fact, Standard Italian is itself either a continuation of, or a dialect heavily based on, Florentine Tuscan. The indigenous local Romance tongues of Italy are therefore classified as separate languages that evolved independently from Latin, rather than \"dialects\" or variations of the Italian language. Conversely, with the spread of Standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, local varieties of Italian have also developed throughout the peninsula, influenced to varying extents by the underlying local languages, most noticeably at the phonological level; though regional boundaries seldom correspond to isoglosses distinguishing these varieties, these variations on Italians are commonly referred to as Regional Italian (\"italiano regionale\").\n\nThere are several minority languages that belong to other Indo-European branches, such as Cimbrian (Germanic), Arbëresh (Albanian), the Slavomolisano dialect of Serbo-Croatian (Slavic), and Griko (Hellenic). Other non-indigenous languages are spoken by a substantial percentage of the population due to immigration.\n\nItaly is a signatory of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but has not ratified the treaty, and therefore its provisions protecting regional languages do not apply in the country.\n\nThe Charter does not, however, establish at what point differences in expression result in a separate language, deeming it an \"often controversial issue\", and citing the necessity to take into account, other than purely linguistic criteria, also \"psychological, sociological and political considerations\".\n\nThe following minority languages are officially recognized as \"historical language minorities\" by the Law no. 482/1999: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian (Legge 15 Dicembre 1999, n. 482, Art. 2, comma 1). The selection of those languages to the exclusion of numerous others is a matter of some controversy. Some interpretations of said law also state that the phrasing would seem to imply a further distinction, considering only some groups (namely Albanians, Catalans, Germanic peoples indigenous to Italy, Greeks, Slovenes and Croats) to be national minorities. Nonetheless, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, signed and ratified by Italy in 1997, applies to all the groups mentioned by the 1999 national law, with the addition of the Romani.\n\nThe original Italian Constitution does not explicitly express that Italian is the official national language. Since the constitution was penned there have been some laws and articles written on the procedures of criminal cases passed that explicitly state that Italian should be used:\n\n\n\nAccording to the UNESCO's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, there are 31 endangered languages in Italy. The degree of endangerment is classified in different categories ranging from 'safe' (safe languages are not included in the atlas) to 'extinct' (when there are no speakers left).\n\nThe source for the languages' distribution is the Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger unless otherwise stated, and refers to Italy exclusively.\n\n\n\n\nAll living languages indigenous to Italy are part of the Indo-European language family. The source is the SIL's Ethnologue unless otherwise stated. Language classification can be a controversial issue, when a classification is contested by academic sources, this is reported in the 'notes' column.\n\nThey can be divided into Romance languages and non-Romance languages.\n\nNot included is Corsican, which is mainly spoken on the French island of Corsica. Istriot is only spoken in Croatia. Judeo-Italian is moribund.\nSardinian is a distinct language group with significant phonological and lexical differences among its varieties. \"Ethnologue\", not without controversy, even goes as far as considering Sardinian to be four separate languages, all being included along with Corsican and the Corso-Sardinian varieties in a hypothetical subgroup (Southern Romance) which has gained little support from linguists. UNESCO, while seeming to share the same opinion of Ethnologue by calling Gallurese and Sassarese alternately \"Sardinian\", considers them to be dialects of Corsican rather than Sardinian on the other hand. As is not infrequently the case in such controversies, the linguistic landscape of Sardinia is in principle most accurately described as being, for the most part, a dialect continuum. \n\nThe Northern Italian languages are conventionally defined as those Romance languages spoken north of the La Spezia–Rimini Line, which runs through the northern Apennine Mountains just to the north of Tuscany; however, the dialects of Occitan and Franco-Provençal spoken in the extreme northwest of Italy (e.g. the Valdôtain in the Aosta Valley) are generally excluded. The classification of these languages is difficult and not agreed-upon, due both to the variations among the languages and to the fact that they share isoglosses of various sorts with both the Italo-Romance languages to the south and the Gallo-Romance languages to the northwest.\n\nOne common classification divides these languages into four groups:\n\nAny such classification runs into the basic problem that there is a dialect continuum throughout northern Italy, with a continuous transition of spoken dialects between e.g. Venetian and Ladin, or Venetian and Emilio-Romagnolo (usually considered Gallo-Italian).\n\nAll of these languages are considered innovative relative to the Romance languages as a whole, with some of the Gallo-Italian languages having phonological changes nearly as extreme as standard French (usually considered the most phonologically innovative of the Romance languages). This distinguishes them significantly from standard Italian, which is extremely conservative in its phonology (and notably conservative in its morphology).\n\nApproximate distribution of the regional languages of Sardinia and Southern Italy according to the UNESCO's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger:\n\nAlthough \"[al]most all Italian dialects were being written in the Middle Ages, for administrative, religious, and often artistic purposes,\" use of local language gave way to stylized Tuscan, eventually labeled Italian. Local languages are still occasionally written, but only the following regional languages of Italy have a standardised written form. This may be widely accepted or used alongside more traditional written forms:\n\n\n\n"}

He appealed for the Jews to change their way of thinking, freeing themselves from dogmas ruling the Jewish religion, tradition and history, but is also known for his work with pre-modern Jewish myths and legends. He wrote in Hebrew, Yiddish and German and has been described as \"the first Hebrew writer living in Berlin to be revered in the world of German letters\".\n\nMicha Josef Berdyczewski was born in 1865 in the town Medzhybizh in western Ukraine, to a family of Hasidic Rabbis. His father was the town Rabbi. In his youth he began to read works from the Jewish Enlightenment, and their influence is noticeable in his works. Berdyczewski was forced to divorce his first wife following her family's objection to his involvement with secular literature. He then moved to the Volozhin Yeshiva, but there too, his pursuit of unconventional literature stirred anger and objection.\n\nOne of his earliest publications was about this period of his life—an article titled \"Hetzitz V'nifga\" (הציץ ונפגע in Hebrew—literally \"peeked and got hurt\", meaning \"gone to heresy\"), published in 1888 in the newspaper \"Ha-Melitz\". Most of his works from this period were polemic, and his emotional style became his trademark throughout his writing career.\n\nIn 1890 he went to Germany and Switzerland, studied at the universities of Berlin, Breslau and Bern, and completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree. In this period Berdyczewski studied the works of the great German philosophers Nietzsche and Hegel, and was deeply influenced by them. In the ten years until his return to Ukraine he published many articles and stories in Hebrew journals. Up to 1900, the year in which he married Rahel Ramberg, Berdyczewski had published ten books.\n\nUpon his return to Ukraine, Berdyczewski encountered the harsh reality of the Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement, and subsequently the subject of many of his stories is the deterioration of the traditional way of life.\n\nAfter a short stay in Warsaw, Berdyczewski returned to Germany in 1911, where he lived until his death in 1921. He is buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Weißensee, Berlin.\n\nBerdyczewski adopted the surname Bin-Gorion, first used to sign a collection of his works that he published in Berlin in 1914. The name Bin-Gorion is also inscribed on his tombstone. His last years were spent in intensive writing and research, collecting Jewish legends and folktales and publishing in Hebrew, Yiddish, and German. After his death, his wife and their son Emanuel Bin-Gorion translated some of his works into German, among them \"Die Sagen der Juden\" (\"The Legends of the Jews\", 1935) and \"Der Born Judas\" (\"The Well of Judah\"), published in six volumes.\n\nBerdyczewski's popularity among the Jews of his age is attributed to his success in expressing their ambivalent attitude towards the traditional Jewish world, and to the secular European culture.\n\nThe Israeli moshav Sdot Micha, founded in 1955, was named after him.\n\n\n"}

There are proposals linking this unclassified language with Nadahup, but also with other languages.\n\nNadahup consists of about four languages, based on mutual intelligibility. Nadeb and Kuyawi, Hup and Yahup, and Nukak and Kakwa, however, share 90% of their vocabulary and are mutually intelligible, and so are separate languages only in a sociolinguistic sense. These four branches are not close: Although the family was first suggested in 1906, only 300 cognates have been found, which include pronouns but no other grammatical forms.\nNadëb may be the most divergent; of the other languages, there is disagreement on the placement of Nïkâk. Martins (1999) propose two classifications, pending further research:\n\nHowever, Epps considers Hup and Yahup to be distinct languages, and maintains that the inclusion of the poorly attested Nukak and Kakwa has not been demonstrated and is in fact highly dubious:\n\nDâw and Hup—especially Hup—have undergone grammatical restructuring under Tucano influence. They have lost prefixes but acquired suffixes from grammaticalized verb roots. They also have heavily monosyllabic roots, as can be seen by the reduction of Portuguese loan words to their stressed syllable, as in Dâw \"yẽl’\" \"money\", from Portuguese \"dinheiru.\" Nadëb and Nïkâk, on the other hand, have polysyllabic roots. Nïkâk allows a single prefix per word, whereas Nadëb, which lies outside the Vaupés language area, is heavily prefixing and polysynthetic: Up to nine prefixes per word (which is highly unusual for the Amazon), with incorporation of nouns, prepositions, and adverbs.\n\nRivet (from 1920), Kaufman (1994) and Pozzobon (1997) include Puinave within the family.

For example, almost all languages have the stop consonants /p/, /t/, /k/, and almost all have the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/. Other phonemes differ considerably among languages, but not nearly as much as they would if each language were free to choose arbitrarily.\n\nProposed by Ken Stevens at MIT, quantal theory formalizes the intuition that some speech sounds are easier to produce than others. Sounds that are easier to reliably produce, in the formal way described below, are more common among the languages of the world; those that are harder to reliably produce are less common.\n\nLet Y=f(X), where X is any particular articulatory parameter (tongue tip position, for example), and Y is any particular perceptual parameter (perceived frequency of the peak in the acoustic spectrum, for example). Like any nonlinear relation, f(X) has regions of low slope (|df/dX| small) and regions of high slope (|df/dX| large). Values of Y drawn from a high-slope region are unstable, in the sense that a small change in X causes a large change in Y; values of Y drawn from a low-slope region are conversely stable, in that they are little perturbed by large changes in X. Stevens proposed in 1968 that the stability of low-slope regions makes them more likely to be chosen as discrete linguistic units (phonemes) by the languages of the world, and that the distinction between any pair of phonemes tends similarly to occur across an unstable high-slope boundary region. Examples include\n\n\n\n\nQuantal theory is supported by a theory of language change, developed in collaboration with Jay Keyser, which postulates the existence of redundant or enhancement features.\n\nIt is quite common, in language, to find a pair of phonemes that\ndiffer in two features simultaneously. In English, for example,\n\"thin\" and \"sin\" differ in both the place of articulation of the\nfricative (teeth versus alveolar ridge), and in its loudness\n(nonstrident versus strident). Similarly, \"tell\" and \"dell\" differ in\nboth the voicing of the initial consonant, and in its aspiration (the\n/t/ in \"tell\" is immediately followed by a puff of air, like a short\n/h/ between the plosive and the vowel). In many cases, native\nspeakers have strong and mistaken intuition about the relative\nimportance of the two distinctions, e.g., speakers of English believe\nthat \"thin\" versus \"sin\" is a place of articulation difference, even\nthough the loudness difference is more perceptible. Stevens, Keyser\nand Kawasaki proposed that such\nredundant features evolve as an enhancement of an otherwise weak acoustic\ndistinction, in order to improve the robustness of the language's\nphonological system.\n"}

In the transition from Latin to the Romance languages, verbs went through many phonetic, syntactic, and semantic changes. Most of the distinctions present in classical Latin continued to be made, but synthetic forms were often replaced with analytic ones. Other verb forms changed meaning, and new forms also appeared.\n\nThe following tables present a comparison of the conjugation of the regular verb \"amare\" \"to love\" in Classical Latin, and Vulgar Latin (reconstructed, with stress marked), and five modern Romance languages.\n\nNote that the Vulgar Latin reconstructions are believed to have regularized word stress within each tense (except the present) and that the nasal vowels (marked with ) were probably commonly realized as their non-nasal counterparts. Word-final probably converged on .\n\nWhile the passive voice became completely periphrastic in Romance, the active voice has been morphologically preserved to a greater or lesser extent. The tables below compare the conjugation of the Latin verbs \"sum\" and \"sto\" in the active voice with that of the Romance copulae, their descendants. For simplicity, only the first person singular is listed for finite forms. Note that certain forms in romance languages come from the suppletive verb \"sedeo\" (to be seated) instead of \"sum\", e.g. subjunctive present: \"sedea\" > sia, sea, seja... (medieval Galician-Portuguese, for instance, had double forms in the whole conjugation: sou/sejo, era/sia, fui/sevi, fora/severa, fosse/sevesse...)\n\nIn spite of the remarkable continuity of form, several Latin tenses have changed meaning, especially subjunctives.\n\nThe Latin imperfect subjunctive underwent a change in syntactic status, becoming a personal infinitive in Portuguese and Galician. An alternative hypothesis traces the personal infinitive back to the Latin infinitive, not to a conjugated verb form.\n\nIn many cases, the empty cells in the tables above exist as distinct compound verbs in the modern languages. Thus, the main tense and mood distinctions in classical Latin are still made in most modern Romance languages, though some are now expressed through compound rather than simple verbs. Some examples, from Romanian:\n\n\nNew forms also developed, such as the conditional, which in most Romance languages started out as a periphrasis, but later became a simple tense.

No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good storytelling abilities and imagination. Screenwriters are not hired employees but contracted freelancers. Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec) and so write without being hired or paid for it. If such a script is sold, it is called a spec script. What separates a professional screenwriter from an amateur screenwriter is that professional screenwriters are usually represented by a talent agency. Also, professional screenwriters do not often work for free, but amateur screenwriters will often work for free and are considered \"writers in training.\" Spec scripts are usually penned by unknown professional screenwriters and amateur screenwriters.\n\nThere are a legion of would-be screenwriters who attempt to enter the film industry, but it often takes years of trial-and-error, failure, and gritty persistence to achieve success. In \"Writing Screenplays that Sell\", Michael Hague writes, \"Screenplays have become, for the last half of [the twentieth] century, what the Great American Novel was for the first half. Closet writers who used to dream of the glory of getting into print now dream of seeing their story on the big or small screen.\"\n\nEvery screenplay and teleplay begins with a thought or idea, and screenwriters use their ideas to write scripts, with the intention of selling them and having them produced. In some cases, the script is based on an existing property, such as a book or person's life story, which is adapted by the screenwriter. The majority of the time, a film project gets initiated by a screenwriter. The initiator of the project gets the exclusive writing assignment. They are referred to as \"exclusive\" assignments or \"pitched\" assignments. Screenwriters who often pitch new projects, whether original or an adaptation, often do not have to worry about competing for assignments and are often more successful. When word is put out about a project a film studio, production company, or producer wants done, they are referred to as \"open\" assignments. Open assignments are more competitive. If screenwriters are competing for an open assignment, more-established writers usually win the assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and personally offered a writing assignment.\n\nMany screenwriters also work as full or part-time script doctors, attempting to better a script to suit the desires of a director or studio. For instance, studio management may have a complaint that the motivations of the characters are unclear or that the dialogue is weak.\n\nScript-doctoring can be quite lucrative, especially for the better-known writers. David Mamet and John Sayles, for instance, fund the movies that they direct themselves, usually from their own screenplays, by writing and doctoring scripts for others. In fact, some writers make very profitable careers out of being the ninth or tenth writer to work on a piece, and they often work on projects that never see exposure to an audience of any size. Many up-and-coming screenwriters also ghostwrite projects and allow more-established screenwriters to take public credit for the project to increase the chances of it getting picked up.\n\nAfter a screenwriter finishes a project, he or she pairs with an industry-based representative, such as a producer, director, literary agent, entertainment lawyer, or entertainment executive. The partnerships often pitch their project to investors or others in a position to further a project. Once the script is sold, the writer has only the rights that were agreed with the purchaser.\n\nA screenwriter becomes credible by having work that is recognized, which gives the writer the opportunity to earn a higher income. As more films are produced independently (outside the studio system), many up-and-coming screenwriters are turning to pitch fests, screenplay contests, and independent development services to gain access to established and credible independent producers. Many development executives are now working independently to incubate their own pet projects.\n\nScreenwriters are rarely involved in the development of a film. Sometimes they come on as advisors, or if they are established, as a producer. Some screenwriters also direct. Although many scripts are sold each year, many do not make it into production because the number of scripts that are purchased every year exceeds the number of professional directors that are working in the film and TV industry. When a screenwriter finishes a project and sells it to a film studio, production company, TV network, or producer, he or she often has to continue networking, mainly with directors or executives, and push to have their projects \"chosen\" and turned into films or TV shows. If interest in a script begins to fade, a project can go dead.\n\nMost professional screenwriters in the U.S. are unionized and are represented by the Writers Guild of America. Although membership in the WGA is recommended, it is not required of a screenwriter to join. The WGA is the final arbiter on awarding writing credit for projects under its jurisdiction. The WGA also looks upon and verifies film copyright materials.\n\n"}

{"id": "26912942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26912942", "title": "Two-gospel hypothesis", "text": "Two-gospel hypothesis\n\nThe two-gospel hypothesis is that the Gospel of Matthew was written before the Gospel of Luke, and that both were written earlier than the Gospel of Mark. It is a proposed solution to the Synoptic Problem, which concerns the pattern of similarities and differences between the three Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The hypothesis, following an original proposal by Augustine of Hippo and expanded by Johann Jakob Griesbach (it was once called the Griesbach hypothesis), was introduced in its current form by William Farmer in 1964. This hypothesis is the most serious alternative to the two-source hypothesis. Its main advantages over the two-source hypothesis include the fact that it relies not just on internal evidence, that it does not require lost sources like the Q document, and that it is supported by the view of the early Church. Unlike the two-source hypothesis, the two-gospel hypothesis concludes that the traditional accounts of the gospels (order and date of publication, as well as authorship) are accurate. A further development of the Augustinian and Griesbach hypotheses is found in the hypothesis of Eta Linnemann, followed by F. David Farnell, that the \"two Gospels\" were required by the \"two witnesses\" rule of Deuteronomy.\n\nThe hypothesis states that Matthew was written first, while Christianity was still centered in Jerusalem, to calm the hostility between Jews and Christians. After Matthew, as the church expanded beyond the Holy Land, Luke was written as a gospel to the Gentiles. But since neither Luke (nor his patron Paul) were eyewitnesses of Jesus, Peter gave public testimonies that validated Luke’s gospel. These public speeches were transcribed into Mark’s gospel and distributed immediately thereafter, as recorded by the early Church father Irenaeus. Paul then allowed Luke’s gospel to be published.\n\nThe proposal suggests that Matthew was written by the apostle Matthew, probably in the 40s AD. At the time, the church had yet to extend outside of Jerusalem. The primary political problem within the church community was caused by the fact that Jewish authorities were outright hostile to Jesus and his followers. Matthew wrote his account in order to show that Jesus was actually the fulfillment of what Jewish scripture had prophesied. It has been long recognized that Matthew is the most “Jewish” of the gospels. It, for example, heavily references Jewish scripture and Jewish history.\n\nWhen Stephen was martyred, as recorded in the Book of Acts, the disciples scattered beyond Jerusalem into Gentile (mostly Greek but also Syriac) towns. There they began preaching, and a large number of Pagans in Antioch quickly became Christians. By the mid 50s, Paul, who converted and claimed the title of \"Apostle to the Gentiles\" began to realize the need for a gospel to the Gentiles. This gospel would have to deemphasize the Mosaic Law and recent Jewish history in order to appeal to Greeks and Romans. Paul commissioned his associate, Luke, who used Matthew, as well as other sources. The first verses of Luke’s gospel reference the fact that “many have undertaken to draw up an account” of the testimony of the actual eyewitnesses, and, as such, he has “carefully investigated everything from the beginning” in order to “write an orderly account”. Once the gospel had been written, Paul delayed its publication. He decided that he needed Peter’s public testimony as to its accuracy, since neither Paul nor Luke had known Jesus before his death.\n\nPaul asked Peter, who was the leader of the Apostles, to testify that Luke's account was accurate. According to early church sources, Peter gave a series of speeches to senior Roman army officers. Due to the commonality between Mark and Luke, these speeches would have constituted Peter’s public “seal of approval” upon Luke’s gospel. These church sources suggest that Peter was ambivalent when Mark asked him if he could write down the words of the speeches. However, since the Roman officers who heard the speeches liked them, they asked for copies, and so Mark made fifty copies of Peter’s speeches. These copies began circulating, and became Mark’s gospel. Only after the speeches by Peter were made (and Mark’s transcriptions began circulating) did Paul feel confident enough to publish Luke’s gospel.\n\nThe two-gospel hypothesis assumes that Peter made sure that his speeches agreed with both Matthew and (the still unpublished) Luke. Since Matthew was the primary source for Luke, and Matthew’s gospel (the only published gospel at the time) would have been well known to Peter, he mostly would have preached on the contents of Matthew. Knowing Matthew better than Luke, Peter was more likely to mention details found in Matthew and not Luke than vice versa. This would explain why there are more details found in Mark and Matthew but not Luke than there are details found in Mark and Luke but not Matthew. It also explains why Mark is so much shorter than Matthew and Luke, is more anecdotal and emotional, is less polished, and why only it begins immediately with Jesus’ public ministry. Peter was giving public speeches as to what he saw, and never intended his speeches to become a full gospel. This was directly asserted by the early church historians, and explains why there are so few commentaries on Mark (as opposed to Matthew, Luke and John) until a relatively late date. It appears to have been considered the least important gospel in the early church.\n\nMuch of the evidence for the two-gospel hypothesis comes from the gospels themselves (\"internal evidence\"), while some of the evidence is found in the testimony of the early church (\"external evidence\"). The early church didn't just testify as to who wrote the gospels, in what order, and when they wrote them, it also testified on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of each gospel. For example, early church documents claim that Mark's Gospel was created after Mark made fifty copies of a series of speeches that Peter had given in Rome. The external evidence (mainly the testimony of the early church) is the main difference between the two hypotheses. The two-gospel hypothesis does not dismiss the views of the early church, and makes assumptions based on both the internal and external evidence. The two-source hypothesis, in contrast, is based on the internal evidence for Marcan priority.\n\nApproximately 25% of Matthew and 25% of Luke are identical, but are not found in Mark. This has been explained in the two-source hypothesis as coming from the hypothetical Q document, although by the two-gospel hypothesis, this material was copied by Luke from Matthew, but not testified to by Mark because Peter had not seen it. The two-source hypothesis also assumes that the information unique to Matthew (“M”) and Luke (“L”) came from unknown sources. The two-gospel hypothesis, in contrast, assumes “M” to be mostly Matthew’s testimony and “L” to be the eyewitness accounts mentioned in the first verses of Luke’s gospel. In addition, it gives a specific reason for the fact that Mark has more in common with Matthew than it does with Luke.\nBy the 1960s, scholars considered the two-source hypothesis to be the unquestioned solution to the synoptic problem. By the 1990s, however, the consensus had ended, and some scholars claimed that the two-source hypothesis had even been disproven. Subsequently, the two-gospel hypothesis has emerged as the most serious challenger to the two-source hypothesis.\n\nThe two-gospel theory is more of a conjecture than the two-source hypothesis because, unlike that theory, it depends on the unreliable accounts of the early church. Since the two-source hypothesis does not accept the conjecture of the early church, it follows from internal evidence (such as the shortness of Mark) and logic (e.g. ‘why would Mark write a shorter version of a gospel in existence?’)\n\nThe Griesbach hypothesis is similar to the two-gospel hypothesis. However, unlike the two-gospel hypothesis, the Griesbach hypothesis is principally a literary hypothesis. What came to be labeled the Griesbach Hypothesis was already anticipated by the British scholar Henry Owen (1716–1795), in a piece he published in 1764, and by Friedrich Andreas Stroth (1750–1785) in an article he published anonymously in 1781. Johann Jakob Griesbach (January 4, 1745 – March 24, 1812), to whom this source hypothesis was first accredited, alluded to his conclusion that Matthew wrote the first of the canonical gospels and that Luke, not Mark, made first use of Matthew in composing the second of the canonical gospels in an address celebrating the Easter season at the University of Jena in 1783. Later, for similar Whitsun programs at Jena (1789–1790), Griesbach published a much more detailed \"Demonstration that the Whole Gospel of Mark is Excerpted from the Narratives of Matthew & Luke.\"\n\nGriesbach's theory was, therefore, one of direct literary dependence between and among the gospels of Matthew, Luke and Mark, or what German scholars came to call a \"utilization hypothesis.\" According to Griesbach, the historical order of the gospels was, first, Matthew; second Luke, making use of Matthew and other non-Matthaean tradition; and third, Mark, making use of both Matthew and Luke. In proposing this hypothesis, Griesbach maintained Matthaean priority, as had Augustine before him, along with every other scholar in the church prior to the late eighteenth century. Griesbach's main support for his thesis lies in passages where Matthew and Luke agree over and against Mark (e.g. Matthew 26:68; Luke 22:64; Mark 14:65), the so-called Minor Agreements.\n\nMany generic arguments in favor of Markan Priority and/or Two-source hypothesis also work as arguments against the two-gospel hypothesis. While it is impossible to list all arguments in favor and against the theory, some notable arguments are as follows.\n\n\nA related theory has Luke drawing not directly from Matthew, but from a common source, seen as a proto-Matthew. This was advanced in the nineteenth century by Wilhelm de Wette and Friedrich Bleek, and more recently revived by Powers.\n\nMatthaean priority is also a cornerstone of the Augustinian hypothesis, which, however, has Luke drawing from Mark rather than vice versa.\n\n\nFor Griesbach's life and work, including the full text of the cited work in Latin and in English translation, cf. Bernard Orchard and Thomas R. W. Longstaff (ed.), \"J. J. Griesbach: Synoptic and Text-Critical Studies 1776–1976\", Volume 34 in SNTS Monograph Series (Cambridge University Press, hardback 1978, paperback 2005 ).\n\n"}

In 2009, teams from two schools competed in a pilot competition, with the winners taking part in the international contest as guests of the All-Ireland Linguistics Olympiad. In 2010, an independent olympiad was created and has taken place every year since.\n\nProblem-solving competitions in linguistics for secondary school students have been taking place around the world since the 1960s. In Russia, the Moscow and St Petersburg Linguistic Olympiads are credited with inspiring hundreds of young talented scholars to choose linguistics as an academic major and profession. Currently there are national contests within Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. There is also an International Linguistics Olympiad in which students from many countries compete, which began in 2003, and was first hosted by Bulgaria.\n\nIn 2009, two UK schools, the Manchester Grammar School and Downlands Community School, took part as guests in the Irish competition, and the winning team represented the UK at the International Olympiad. This triggered the foundation of a permanent committee for the UK Linguistics Olympiad, and the creation of a consortium of olympiads held in English-speaking countries, ELCLO, as a means for pooling resources with NACLO, AILO and OzCLO, the American, Irish and Australian Linguistics Olympiads respectively. The UKLO committee is chaired by Dick Hudson, with Neil Sheldon serving as vice-chair.\n\nIn 2010, 560 students from 28 schools entered, 223 at Foundation, and 337 at Advanced level. In 2011, 1165 entries were received from 49 schools, 349 at Foundation, and 816 at Advanced level. 2012 saw the introduction of the Intermediate level, with 1912 entries from 300 schools, 432 at Foundation, 498 at Intermediate and 982 at Advanced level. 2013 saw total entries number 2878, with 1069 at Foundation, 643 at Intermediate and 1166 at Advanced level. In 2015, a new, lowest entry level was introduced, called Breakthrough, with 96 entrants. By 2018, the numbers had increased to 220 in Breakthrough, 1042 at Foundation, 970 at Intermediate and 1650 at Advanced.\n\nThe Olympiad has sponsorship and support from various organisations including the British Academy, The Linguistics Association of Great Britain, The British Association for Applied Linguistics, The Philological Society, Routes into Languages, The School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics, Sheffield University and The School of Philosophy, Psychology & Language Sciences, Edinburgh University.\n\nThe Olympiad has received coverage in the first and second issues of Babel magazine, as well as in the Francophonie journal and Attain magazine. Olympic athlete Christine Ohuruogu MBE is the patron of UKLO, having completed a Linguistics degree at University College London.\n\nThe UK has sent a delegation to the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) every year since 2009, and has competed in 10 olympiads. They have sent 60 participants in 15 teams, selected through UKLO. In competition, teams from the UK have brought home 27 medals (10 gold, 6 silver and 11 bronze), 3 team trophies (1 gold and 2 bronze), 1 first-place team cup, 3 best solution prizes, and 12 honourable mentions. In addition, the UK has sent 4 Repeat Medalists and 2 Dream Teams to the Hall of Fame.\nThe UK Linguistics Olympiad was the host for the 2013 IOL, held at the Manchester Grammar School and chaired by Neil Sheldon. The competition in Manchester was featured on an edition of BBC Radio Four's Word of Mouth programme centring on language games.\n\nThe competition is divided into two rounds. Round 1 is open to all secondary school pupils, while Round 2 is invitation only.\n\n10 linguistic data problems are posed in each year's Round 1 papers, with the Breakthrough paper being 1-3, Foundation 2-5, Intermediate 4-7, and Advanced 6-10. The intention is that each problem is harder than the previous. At Breakthrough, Foundation and Intermediate levels, participants may enter either individually or as part of a group of 2-4 students, and timings and conditions can be decided by schools. At the Advanced level, the competition must take the format of an individual, two and a half hour test sat under controlled conditions.\n\nRoughly 16 of the top scorers from the Advanced paper are invited to participate in Round 2, which takes the form of a residential training weekend at a host university, followed by a three-hour test posing five more problems. Eight competitors in two teams from Round 2 are invited to participate in the International Linguistics Olympiad and represent the UK, with selection being based mostly on performance in the Round 2 paper, but past performances at IOL and Round 2 are taken into account, as is performance in the training throughout the weekend.\n\nSince 2009, the UK has sent teams annually to the IOL.\n\nNote: This team was entered into the IOL Hall of Fame as a \"Dream Team\" because all members of the team received a medal.\n"}

The name comes from the practice of early \"bushi\" who kept ink stones inside their quivers.\n\nJapanese writing was traditionally done using the writing set inspired from China: an \"inking stone\", a small stick of solid ink (sumi) (which is turned to usable liquid ink by grinding on the inking stone and watering), and brushes. The complete set was easily portable and took time to prepare the materials for writing.\nDuring the Kamakura era (1185–1333), the idea of ink-saturated cotton was developed. By touching a calligraphy brush to the cotton, one could ink the bristles with reduced risk of dripping or spilling ink. By enclosing the cotton in a little box (\"sumi tsubo\"\"), a writing set was made convenient and portable.\n\nThe first \"yatate\" were long boxes, with the ink compartment in the axis of the pen. The \"smoking pipe\" shape was designed to increase the quantity of available ink. In the late Edo era, another design was developed, with the ink box attached to the pen shaft by a chain; the ink box was used as a \"netsuke\" to fix the \"yatate\" to the belt, while other \"yatate\" are simply put in the belt like a fan.\n\nAs only members of the samurai caste were permitted to carry \"katana\", some \"yatate\" were designed to be used for self-defense. Some late \"yatate\" were made of a special alloy of gold and copper called \"shakudo\", specifically designed to turn purple-black over time, and give the \"yatate\" its finish.\n\n"}
