{"id": "41859572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41859572", "title": "American Forensic Association National Individual Events Tournament", "text": "American Forensic Association National Individual Events Tournament\n\nThe American Forensic Association National Individual Events Tournament (AFA-NIET) is an intercollegiate, individual events based forensics tournament held in conjunction with the first Saturday in April, beginning on the prior Friday and continuing through the subsequent Monday. Of the two most prominent college-level IE (individual events) national tournaments (the other being National Forensic Association Nationals), the AFA-NIET has significantly more stringent qualification procedures and a smaller, but more exclusive field of competition. The AFA-NIET represents the culmination of the forensics season for many collegiate speech teams. \nThe 2016 AFA-NIET was hosted by the University of Florida over the course of April 1–4. 69 Schools attended the 2016 AFA-NIET, fielding over 1,100 entries in the 11 offered events.\n\nFormed in 1949, the American Forensic Association was created with the goal of teaching students to utilize the skills of argumentation and advocacy. In the first decades of its existence, the AFA was primarily focused on promoting debate competitions, with little to no interest in individual events.\n\nAs a result in the rapid rise of interest in individual events in the late 1960s, Dr. Seth Hawkins of Southern Connecticut State University, Dr. Raymond Beaty of Ohio University and Dr. Jack Howe of California State University, Long Beach began to propose ideas of an organized national tournament focused on individual events. Dr. Beaty reported that his proposals were entirely disregarded by the debate community. During the 1970-71 forensics season, Dr. Hawkins made the decision that, despite the lack of support from the debate community, the increased interest in IEs justified the establishment of a national championship tournament. This tournament was held on the campus of Ohio Northern University, 23 schools participated, and the annual IE tournament that would eventually become known as NFA Nationals was established.\n\nRealizing that the NFA's new IE national tournament could perpetuate the already existing split within the community regarding the competitive validity of IEs, the AFA began working towards a solution in 1972. Jerry Anderson, the president of the AFA at the time, began calling meetings to address measures that could be taken to incorporate IEs into the AFA's agenda. Anderson proposed a change to the AFA's constitution to allow for the inclusion of IEs, this change was ratified in 1973. Anderson, along with E.R. Tame, the Chair of the Educational Policies Committee, proposed that the AFA enact institutional changes to accommodate IEs. In 1973, the AFA voted to establish the AFA Committee on Individual Events.\nIn the three years following its establishment, the Committee worked towards developing an inceptive procedural standard for the AFA-NIET. This effort was bolstered in 1976, as James Weaver assumed the presidency of the AFA. Weaver proved to be a staunch advocate of the NIET's establishment. Within the first year of taking office, Weaver established the National Individual Events Tournament Committee, and appointed Larry Schnoor of Minnesota State University, Mankato as Chair. Shortly thereafter, Schnoor and the committee began making preparatory arrangements for the inaugural AFA-NIET.\n\nIn April 1978 the inaugural AFA-NIET was hosted by Illinois State University. 58 schools attended the 1978 AFA-NIET.\n\nBoth team and individual sweepstakes awards are given to the best overall performing team and individual at each AFA-NIET.\n\nTeam sweepstakes awards are given to the teams with the highest total of sweepstakes points earned by the team's individual competitors.\nAt the AFA-NIET, team sweepstakes points are awarded as follows:\n\nWhen tabulating individual sweepstakes, only the individual competitor's ranks and placings are used, and points awarded for preliminary ballot ranks are doubled. Otherwise individual sweepstakes are tabulated identically to team sweepstakes.\n\nThere are 11 events that are sanctioned by the AFA and held at the AFA-NIET. All events fall into one of three categories:\n\nThere are five AFA sponsored events that fall into the interpretation category. Interpretation events involve the performer selecting and cutting a script, (usually from a play, book, or movie) and acting out the scenes. All AFA interpretation events require the performer to hold a 'black book' that contains their manuscript; this book can be used as the competitor sees fit, meaning it may be used as a prop. All interpretation events have a 10-minute time limit.\n\n\nPoetry interpretation involves the performance of a selected cutting of poetry with significant literary merit. The performance may be one poem, or a combination of multiple pieces (often referred to as a 'program'). Play cuttings are prohibited from use. The focus of this performance should be on the development of language.\n\nProse interpretation features the performance of a prose piece of significant literary merit. The performance may feature only one work, or it may be a program. Play cuttings and poetry pieces are prohibited from use. The focus of this performance should be on development of the narrative.\n\n\nUnder the AFA rules of Drama Interpretation, the performer is to create a cutting from either stage, screen, or radio with significant literary merit. The performance may feature only one play, or it may be a program. The performer may portray multiple characters. The focus of this performance should be on the development of characterization.\n\n\nProgram Oral Interpretation, often referred to as POI (pronounced \"poy\"), is an event that is unique to the AFA-NIET and is not sanctioned by NFA nationals. In POI, the performer is to create a program of selections linked by a common theme, and consisting of at least two, or up to all three of the different genres of forensics interpretation literature (prose, poetry, and drama), with the pieces being of significant literary merit. Each genre must be represented by a unique piece of literature. (one piece may not represent multiple genres) One selection may be original. The focus of this event should be on the development of the theme through the established narrative.\n\n\nDramatic Duo is the only AFA sponsored event to feature two competitors in the performance. The performance may feature cuttings from any genre of literature; the cutting may be only one piece, or it may be a program. The selected cutting can be either humorous, serious, or a combination of the two. The performers are not allowed to directly look at each other or touch each other. The performers may each portray multiple characters if they so choose.\n\nThere are four AFA sponsored events that fall into the category of public address. Public address events involve the performance of an originally written speech covering a specific topic or issue. Audio and visual aids are permitted for use in all public address events. Performers are heavily encouraged to integrate multiple sources into their speech. All events in this category have a 10 minute time limit.\n\n\nPersuasive speaking involves the performer delivering an original speech that is intended to inspire action or change the beliefs of the audience. Minimal notes are permitted, but heavily discouraged. Visual aids are permitted, but not mandatory. Judging should be based on the performer's public speaking skills and the effectiveness of the message.\n\n\nIn informative speaking the performer delivers an original, factual speech that is intended to inform and educate the audience about a unique subject. Minimal notes are permitted, but heavily discouraged.\n\n\nAlso referred to as CA for short, and \"rhetorical criticism\" at NFA nationals; communication analysis is an original speech centered on the evaluation of a communication event, often referred to as the 'artifact'. (speeches, movements, advertisements, etc.) The evaluation should utilize rhetorical principles and theories. Manuscripts are permitted, but heavily discouraged.\n\n\nOften referred to as ADS for short, after dinner speaking is an original, humorous speech centered on a single theme or subject. While the speech should be mostly humorous, it should not resemble a stand-up comedy act. Judging should be based on speaking skill, speech coherence, and good taste in humor. Minimal notes are permitted, but heavily discouraged.\n\nThere are two limited preparation events sponsored by the AFA. Limited preparation events are unique from all other forensics events based on the fact that the speech is written 'on the spot' with a limited amount of time allocated to preparation. Both events are performed as speeches. Limited notes (usually a 3\"x5\" index card) are commonly used in these events. Audio and visual aids may \"not\" be used. All limited preparation events have a 7 minute time limit.\n\n\nIn extemporaneous speaking, commonly referred to as extemp, competitors are given three topics covering a range of current events. The competitor will select one of the three topics, and is then given 30 minutes to prepare an original speech, utilizing multiple sources. Extemporaneous speaking is the only AFA sponsored event where competitors speak in a previously assigned order. Limited notes may or may not be used, and are commonplace in this event.\n\nIn impromptu speaking the competitor is given a quotation to use as the topic of their speech. Impromptu speaking is known for its uniquely short preparation time, competitors are given 7 minutes to both prepare and give their speech; speakers are heavily encouraged to keep their preparation time below two minutes. The speech may be humorous, serious, or a combination of both, but should stay relevant to the quotation and the speaker's interpretation of it. Minimal notes are permitted.\n\nThere are two ways that a competitor can qualify an event for the AFA-NIET:\n\nFor an event to be qualified through the at-large process, the competitor must obtain three 'legs' (placings) in the event that total out to 8 or less. (e.g. 3rd, 3rd, 2nd; 5th, 2nd, 1st; 6th, 1st, 1st; 1st, 1st, 1st) In the event that a final round contains more than six competitors (e.g. unbreakable tie), no placing beyond 6th will count as a leg under any circumstances. A leg can be acquired at any tournament in which at least 9 schools are participating.\n\nPlacings will only count as a leg if the requirement for number of competitors in the event is met:\n\nEvents may also be qualified for the AFA-NIET by placing in the top 10% of the field at their school's respective district qualifying tournament.\n\nAll AFA member schools are placed into a district. District placement is largely (but not entirely) based on the state that the school is located in:\n\nNote: Schools may enter a petitioning process if they wish to be placed in a different district.\n\nThe respective district committees determine when the district qualifying tournament will be, specifically, but it must take place after January 15 and before the third weekend of March. Events that have already been qualified through the at-large process are ineligible for competition at the district qualifying tournaments. A student qualifies an event for the AFA-NIET when they place in the top 10% of that event, rounding up. (e.g. 20 competitors: top 2; 21 competitors: top 3) If an individual has two legs coming into the district qualifier and finishes at a placing sufficient for their third leg, then that event is qualified at-large, and everyone who placed below said individual is moved up one spot, allowing them to potentially qualify.\n"}

He recanted in a work called \"Querelae\", and was pardoned by Caesar following the intercession of his friends, above all, Cicero, who defended him in 69 BC with the speech \"Pro Caecina\".\n\nCaecina was regarded as an important authority on the Etruscan system of divination (\"Etrusca Disciplina\"), which he endeavoured to place on a scientific footing by harmonizing its theories with the doctrines of the Stoics.\n\nConsiderable fragments of his work (dealing with lightning) are to be found in Seneca (\"Naturales quaestiones\", ii. 31–49). Caecina was on intimate terms with Cicero, who speaks of him as a gifted and eloquent man and was no doubt considerably indebted to him in his own treatise \"De Divinatione\". Some of their correspondence is preserved in Cicero's letters (\"Epistulae ad Familiares\" vi. 5–8; see also ix. and xiii. 66).\n"}
{"id": "1147647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1147647", "title": "Body count", "text": "Body count\n\nA body count is the total number of people killed in a particular event. In combat, a body count is often based on the number of confirmed kills, but occasionally only an estimate. Often used in reference to military combat, the term can also refer to any situation involving multiple killings, such as the actions of death squads or serial killers.\n\nThe military gathers such figures for a variety of reasons, such as determining the need for continuing operations, estimating efficiency of new and old weapons systems, and planning follow-up operations.\n\nBody count figures have a long history in military planning and propaganda.\n\nAccording to Procopius, when the Persians are about to march to a war, the king sits on the throne and many baskets are set before him. The men of the army pass along the baskets one by one, each throwing one arrow in the baskets, which are then sealed with the king's seal. When the army returns to Persia, each man takes an arrow, and the number of casualties will be determined by the number of remaining arrows.\n\nDuring the Holocaust in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and other eastern areas, killing was done by Nazi Germany's military police forces, including \"Einsatzgruppen\", the SD, and Wehrmacht police battalions, in massacres by shooting the victims. Such units measured their progress by counting the number of people killed. These murder operations took place under the guise of anti-partisan warfare, but in reality few of those killed were actually partisans.\n\nSince the goal of the United States in the Vietnam War was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically \"held\" already. Instead, the U.S. Army used body counts to show that the U.S. was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army would lose after the attrition warfare.\n\nAccording to historian Christian Appy, \"search and destroy was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress\" in General Westmoreland’s war of attrition. Search and destroy was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the Viet Cong out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation. This method was controversial, due to two issues. The first is regarding the counting of unarmed civilians killed in actions as enemy combatants in free-fire zone as it was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN battle operations were miscounted as \"enemy KIA\". Another issue is inflationand fabrication of body count in after-action reports, which is reported to have given false and inaccurate casualty figures for enemy dead. \n\nIn the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US military adopted an official policy of not counting deaths. General Tommy Franks' statement that \"we don't do body counts\" was widely reported. Critics claimed that Franks was only attempting to evade bad publicity, while supporters pointed to the failure of body counts to give an accurate impression of the state of the war in Vietnam. At the end of October 2005, it became public that the US military had been counting Iraqi fatalities since January 2004 but only those killed by insurgents and not those killed by the US forces.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "358913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358913", "title": "Broadcast flag", "text": "Broadcast flag\n\nA broadcast flag is a set of status bits (or a \"flag\") sent in the data stream of a digital television program that indicates whether or not the data stream can be recorded, or if there are any restrictions on recorded content. Possible restrictions include the inability to save an unencrypted digital program to a hard disk or other non-volatile storage, inability to make secondary copies of recorded content (in order to share or archive), forceful reduction of quality when recording (such as reducing high-definition video to the resolution of standard TVs), and inability to skip over commercials.\n\nIn the United States, new television receivers using the ATSC standard were supposed to incorporate this functionality by July 1, 2005.\n\nOfficially called \"Digital Broadcast Television Redistribution Control,\" the FCC's rule is in 47 CFR 73.9002(b) and the following sections, stating in part: \"No party shall sell or distribute in interstate commerce a Covered Demodulator Product that does not comply with the Demodulator Compliance Requirements and Demodulator Robustness Requirements.\" According to the rule, hardware must \"actively thwart\" piracy.\n\nThe rule's Demodulator Compliance Requirements insists that all HDTV demodulators must \"listen\" for the flag (or assume it to be present in all signals). Flagged content must be output only to \"protected outputs\" (such as DVI and HDMI ports with HDCP encryption), or in degraded form through analog outputs or digital outputs with visual resolution of 720x480 pixels (EDTV) or less. Flagged content may be recorded only by \"authorized\" methods, which may include tethering of recordings to a single device.\n\nSince broadcast flags could be activated at any time, a viewer who often records a program might suddenly find that it is no longer possible to save their favorite show. This and other reasons lead many to see the flags as a direct affront to consumer rights.\n\nParticularly troubling to open source developers are the Demodulator Robustness Requirements. Devices must be \"robust\" against user access or modifications so that someone could not easily alter it to ignore the broadcast flags that permit access to the full digital stream. Since open-source device drivers are by design user-modifiable, a PC TV tuner card with open-source drivers would not be \"robust\". It is unclear whether binary-only drivers would qualify. In theory it would likely be illegal for open-source projects such as the MythTV project, which creates personal video recorder (PVR) software, to interface with digital television demodulators.\n\nSome companies currently manufacturing devices, such as the pcHDTV devices intended for the Linux market, would likely be forced to halt production. This portion of the rule also effectively prevents individuals from building their own high-definition television sets and receiving devices. (It may seem far-fetched to a layman, but there have been many instances in the past where engineers have built their own analog TVs, and it follows that some people would wish to continue such pursuits in the digital age. The technologies used will most likely be centered around software-defined radio, fast ADCs and FPGA chips - tools which are so generic in their use that their availability cannot be effectively restricted.)\n\nThe GNU Radio project already successfully demonstrated that purely software-based demodulators can exist and the hardware rule is not fully enforceable.\n\nIn \"American Library Association v. FCC\", 406 F.3d 689 (D.C. Cir. 2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the FCC had exceeded its authority in creating this rule. The court stated that the Commission could not prohibit the manufacture of computer or video hardware without copy protection technology because the FCC only has authority to regulate transmissions, not devices that receive communications. While it is always possible that the Supreme Court could overturn this ruling, the more likely reemergence of the broadcast flag is in legislation of the United States Congress granting such authority to the FCC.\n\nOn May 1, 2006, Sen. Ted Stevens inserted a version of the Broadcast Flag into the Communications, Consumer's Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006. On June 22, 2006 Sen. John E. Sununu offered an amendment to strike the broadcast and radio flag, but this failed and the broadcast-flag amendment was approved by the Commerce committee. Nonetheless, the overall bill was never passed, and thus died upon adjournment of the 109th Congress in December 2006.\n\nOn May 18, 2008, News.com reported that Microsoft had confirmed that current versions of Windows Media Center shipping with the Windows family of operating systems adhered to the use of the broadcast flag, following reports of users being blocked from taping specific airings of NBC programs, mainly \"American Gladiators\" and \"Medium\". A Microsoft spokesperson said that Windows Media Center adheres to the \"rules set forth by the FCC\", even though no legislation actually requires following such rules.\n\nOn August 22, 2011, the FCC officially eliminated the broadcast flag regulations.\n\nWith the coming of digital radio, the recording industry is attempting to change the ground rules for copyright of songs played on radio. Currently, over the air (i.e. broadcast but not Internet) radio stations may play songs freely but RIAA wants Congress to insert a radio broadcast flag. On April 26, 2006, Congress held a hearing over the radio broadcast flag. Among the witnesses were musicians Anita Baker and Todd Rundgren.\n\nAt present no equivalent signal is typically used in European DVB transmissions, although DVB-CPCM would provide such a set of signal as defined by DVB-SI, usable on clear-to-air television broadcasts. How adherence to such a system would be enforced in a receiver is not yet clear.\n\nIn the UK, the BBC introduced content protection restrictions in 2010 on Free to Air content by licensing data necessary to receive the service information for the Freeview HD broadcasts. However the BBC have stated the highest protection applied will be to allow only one copy to be made.\n\nISDB broadcasts are protected as to allow the broadcast to be digitally recorded once, but to not allow digital copies of the recording to be made. Analog recordings can be copied freely. It is possible to disallow the use of analog outputs, although this has yet to be implemented. The protection can be circumvented with the correct hardware and software.\n\nThe Digital Video Broadcasting organization is developing DVB-CPCM which allows broadcasters (especially PayTV broadcaster) far more control over the use of content on (and beyond) home networks. The DVB standards are commonly used in Europe and around the world (for satellite, terrestrial, and cable distribution), but are also employed in the United States by Dish Network. In Europe, some entertainment companies are lobbying to legally mandate the use of DVB-CPCM in the next level of the controversial EU Copyright directive. Opponents fear that mandating DVB-CPCM will kill independent receiver manufacturers that use open source operating systems (e.g., Linux-based set-top boxes.)\n\nShould the US broadcast flag return, CPCM would be a candidate for addition to the Table A list of approved technologies for enforcement in the US.\n\nIn the US, since April 15, 2008, pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite television now are flagged to prevent a recording off a pay-per-view channel to a digital video recorders or other related devices from being retained after 24 hours from the ordered time of the film. This is the standard film industry practice, including for digital rentals from the iTunes Store and Google Play. Movies recorded before that point would still be available without flagging and could be copied freely, though as of 2015 those pre-2008 DVR units are well out-of-date or probably non-functional, and the pay-per-view concern is moot for all but special events, as nearly all satellite providers and cable providers have moved to more easily restricted video on demand platforms; pay-per-view films have been drawn down to non-notable content.\n\n\n\n\nRelated to legal or technological status of the Broadcast flag\n"}

Later, Pairault (1965, 1969) added the more northerly Gula languages, Fanian, Koke, and Bolgo, allowing Samarin (1971) to define roughly the current membership of the Bua languages/Adamawa-13.

{"id": "9853230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9853230", "title": "Case government", "text": "Case government\n\nIn linguistics, case government is government of the grammatical case of verb arguments, when a verb or preposition is said to 'govern' the grammatical case on its noun phrase complement, e.g. \"zu\" governs the dative case in German: \"zu mir\" 'to me-dative'. The German term for the notion is \"Rektion.\" Case government may modify the meaning of the verb substantially, even to meanings that are unrelated. Analogously in programming, constructing two different functions of identical name but different parameters is called overloading a function.\n\nCase government is a more important notion in languages with many case distinctions, such as Russian and Finnish. It plays less of a role in English, because English doesn't rely on grammatical cases, except for distinguishing subject pronouns (I, he, she, we, they) from other pronouns (me, him, her, us, them). In English, true case government is absent, but if the aforementioned subject pronouns are understood as regular pronouns in the accusative case, it occurs in sentences such as \"He found me\" (not for example *\"He found I\").\n\nFor example, in Finnish, a verb or sometimes even a particular meaning of a verb is associated with a case the referent noun must be in. \"To go for a walk\" is expressed as \"mennä kävelylle\" (literally \"to go to a walk\"), where \"mennä\" means \"to go\", \"kävely\" is \"a walk\" and \"-lle\" is a postfix that denotes the allative case (usually means \"to\" in English). This case \"must\" be always used in this context; one cannot say *\"mennä kävelyyn\" \"to go into a walk\", for example.\n"}

(Table is organized right-to-left reflecting Hebrew's lexicographic mode.)\n\nThis table shows the development of cursive Hebrew from the 7th through the 19th centuries. This is discussed in the following section, which makes reference to the columns in the table, numbered 1 through 14.\n<br>Figure 3: \"Cursive Writing\" \"(Jewish Encyclopedia, 1901-1906)\".\n\nColumn:\n\nThe brief inscriptions daubed in red ink upon the walls of the catacombs of Venosa are probably the oldest examples of cursive script. Still longer texts in a cursive alphabet are furnished by the clay bowls found in Babylonia and bearing exorcisms against magical influences and evil spirits. These bowls date from the 7th or 8th century, and some of the letters are written in a form that is very antiquated \"(Figure 3, column 1)\". Somewhat less of a cursive nature is the manuscript, which dates from the 8th century. \"Columns 2–14\" exhibit cursive scripts of various countries and centuries. The differences visible in the square alphabets are much more apparent. For instance, the Sephardi rounds off still more, and, as in Arabic, there is a tendency to run the lower lines to the left, whereas the Ashkenazi script appears cramped and disjointed. Instead of the little ornaments at the upper ends of the stems, in the letters a more or less weak flourish of the line appears. For the rest the cursive of the Codices remains fairly true to the square text. \n\nDocuments of a private nature were certainly written in a much more running hand, as the sample from one of the oldest Arabic letters written with Hebrew letters (possibly the 10th century) clearly shows in the papyrus, in \"Führer durch die Ausstellung\", Table XIX., Vienna, 1894, \"(compare Figure 3, column 4)\". However, since the preservation of such letters were not held to be of importance, material of this nature from the earlier times is very scarce, and as a consequence the development of the script is very hard to follow. The last two columns of \"Figure 3\" exhibit the Ashkenazi cursive script of a later date. The next to the last is taken from a manuscript of Elias Levita. The accompanying specimen presents Sephardi script. In this flowing cursive alphabet the ligatures appear more often. They occur especially in letters which have a sharp turn to the left (ג, ז, כ, נ, צ, ח), and above all in נ, whose great open bow offers ample space for another letter \"(see Figure 2)\".\n\nThe following are the successive stages in the development of each letter: \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "60284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60284", "title": "Fountain pen", "text": "Fountain pen\n\nA fountain pen is a nib pen that, unlike its predecessor, the dip pen, contains an internal reservoir of liquid ink. The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits it on paper via a combination of gravity and capillary action. Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via the use of a Pasteur pipette (eyedropper) or syringe, or via an internal filling mechanism which creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) or a vacuum to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges. \n\nAn early historical mention of what appears to be a reservoir pen dates back to the 10th century. According to Ali Abuzar Mari (d. 974) in his \"Kitab al-Majalis wa 'l-musayarat\", the Fatimid caliph Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir, allowing it to be held upside-down without leaking. \n\nThere is compelling evidence that a working fountain pen was constructed and used during the Renaissance by artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo's journals contain drawings with cross-sections of what appears to be a reservoir pen that works by both gravity and capillary action. Historians also took note of the fact that the handwriting in the inventor's surviving journals is of a consistent contrast throughout, rather than the characteristic fading pattern typical of a quill pen caused by expending and re-dipping. While no physical item survives, several working models were reconstructed in 2011 by artist Amerigo Bombara that have since been put on display in museums dedicated to Leonardo.\n\nThe fountain pen was available in Europe in the 17th century, and is shown by contemporary references. In \"Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae\" (a 1636 magazine), German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point. In 1663 Samuel Pepys referred to a metal pen \"to carry ink\". Noted Maryland historian Hester Dorsey Richardson (1862–1933) documented a reference to \"three silver fountain pens, worth 15 shillings\" in England during the reign of Charles II, c. 1649–1685. By the early 18th century such pens were already commonly known as \"fountain pens\". Hester Dorsey Richardson also found a 1734 notation made by Robert Morris the elder in the ledger of the expenses of Robert Morris the younger, who was at the time in Philadelphia, for \"one fountain pen\".\n\nProgress in developing a reliable pen was slow until the mid-19th century because of an imperfect understanding of the role that air pressure plays in the operation of pens. Furthermore, most inks were highly corrosive and full of sedimentary inclusions. The Romanian inventor Petrache Poenaru received a French patent on May 25, 1827, for the invention of the first fountain pen with a barrel made from a large swan quill.\n\nIn 1828, Josiah Mason improved a cheap and efficient slip-in nib in Birmingham, England, which could be added to a fountain pen and in 1830, with the invention of a new machine, William Joseph Gillott, William Mitchell, and James Stephen Perry devised a way to mass manufacture robust, cheap steel pen nibs (Perry & Co). This boosted the Birmingham pen trade and by the 1850s, more than half the steel-nib pens manufactured in the world were made in Birmingham. Thousands of skilled craftsmen were employed in the industry. Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected, enabling the city's factories to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, thus encouraging the development of education and literacy.\n\nIn 1848, American inventor Azel Storrs Lyman patented a pen with \"a combined holder and nib\". From the 1850s, there was a steadily accelerating stream of fountain pen patents and pens in production. However, it was only after three key inventions were in place that the fountain pen became a widely popular writing instrument. Those were the iridium-tipped gold nib, hard rubber, and free-flowing ink.\n\nThe first fountain pens making use of all these key ingredients appeared in the 1850s. In the 1870s Duncan MacKinnon, a Canadian living in New York City, and Alonzo T. Cross of Providence, Rhode Island, created stylographic pens with a hollow, tubular nib and a wire acting as a valve. Stylographic pens are now used mostly for drafting and technical drawing but were very popular in the decade beginning in 1875. In the 1880s the era of the mass-produced fountain pen finally began. The dominant American producers in this pioneer era were Waterman, of New York City, and Wirt, based in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Waterman soon outstripped Wirt, along with many companies that sprang up to fill the new and growing fountain pen market. Waterman remained the market leader until the early 1920s.\n\nAt this time, fountain pens were almost all filled by unscrewing a portion of the hollow barrel or holder and inserting the ink by means of an eyedropper – a slow and messy procedure. Pens also tended to leak inside their caps and at the joint where the barrel opened for filling. Now that the materials' problems had been overcome and the flow of ink while writing had been regulated, the next problems to be solved were the creation of a simple, convenient self-filler and the problem of leakage. In 1890, W. B. Purvis, an African-American, patented a self-filler. Self-fillers began to arrive around the turn of the century; the most successful of these was probably the Conklin crescent-filler, followed by A. A. Waterman's twist-filler. The tipping point, however, was the runaway success of Walter A. Sheaffer's lever-filler, introduced in 1912, paralleled by Parker's roughly contemporary button-filler.\n\nMeanwhile, many inventors turned their attention to the problem of leakage. Some of the earliest solutions to this problem came in the form of a \"safety\" pen with a retractable point that allowed the ink reservoir to be corked like a bottle. The most successful of these came from Francis C. Brown of the Caw's Pen and Ink Co. and from Morris W. Moore of Boston.\n\nIn 1898, George Safford Parker released the Parker Jointless, named so because its barrel was single-piece to prevent leakage. The section assembly fit into the pen's end like a cork stopper; any leaked ink was kept inside the nib.\n\nIn 1908, Waterman began marketing a popular safety pen of its own. For pens with non-retractable nibs, the adoption of screw-on caps with inner caps that sealed around the nib by bearing against the front of the section effectively solved the leakage problem (such pens were also marketed as \"safety pens\", as with the Parker Jack Knife Safety and the Swan Safety Screw-Cap).\n\nIn Europe, the German supplies company which came to be known as Pelikan was started in 1838, and first introduced their pen in 1929. This was based upon the acquisition of patents for solid-ink fountain pens from the factory of Slavoljub Penkala from Croatia (patented 1907, in mass production since 1911), and the patent of the Hungarian Theodor Kovacs for the modern piston filler by 1925.\n\nThe decades that followed saw many technological innovations in the manufacture of fountain pens. Celluloid gradually replaced hard rubber, which enabled production in a much wider range of colors and designs. At the same time, manufacturers experimented with new filling systems. The inter-war period saw the introduction of some of the most notable models, such as the Parker Duofold and Vacumatic, Sheaffer's Lifetime Balance series, and the Pelikan 100.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, fountain pens retained their dominance: early ballpoint pens were expensive, were prone to leaks and had irregular inkflow, while the fountain pen continued to benefit from the combination of mass production and craftsmanship.(Bíró's patent, and other early patents on ball-point pens often used the term \"ball-point fountain pen,\" because at the time the ball-point pen was considered a type of fountain pen; that is, a pen that held ink in an enclosed reservoir.)\nThis period saw the launch of innovative models such as the Parker 51, the Aurora 88, the Sheaffer Snorkel, and the Eversharp Skyline and (later) Skyliner, while the Esterbrook J series of lever-fill models with interchangeable steel nibs offered inexpensive reliability to the masses.\n\nBy the 1960s, refinements in ballpoint pen production gradually ensured its dominance over the fountain pen for casual use. Although cartridge-filler fountain pens are still in common use in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, India, and the United Kingdom, and are widely used by young students in most private schools in England and at least one private school in Scotland, a few modern manufacturers (especially Montblanc, Graf von Faber-Castell and Visconti) now depict the fountain pen as a collectible item or a status symbol, rather than an everyday writing tool. However, fountain pens continue to have a growing following among many who view them as superior writing instruments due to their relative smoothness and versatility. Retailers continue to sell fountain pens and inks for casual and calligraphic use. Recently, fountain pens have made a resurgence, with many manufacturers of fountain pens saying sales are climbing. This has led to a new wave of casual use fountain pens and custom ink manufacturers, who utilize online stores to easily sell fountain pens to a wider audience.\n\nThe feed of a fountain pen is the component that connects the nib of the pen with its ink reservoir.\n\nIt not only allows the ink to flow to the nib (in what is often described as a \"controlled leak\") but also regulates the amount of air flowing backwards up to the reservoir to replace this lost ink.\n\nIt does this through the use of a series of narrow channels or \"fissures\" that run down its lower edge. As ink flows down these fissures, air is simultaneously allowed to flow upwards into the reservoir in an even exchange of volumes. The feed allows ink to flow when the pen is being put to paper but ensures ink does not flow when the pen is not in use. The feed makes use of capillary action; this is noticeable when a pen is refilled with a brightly coloured ink. The ink is taken up and into the feed by way of capillary action (and is often visible in clear demonstrator pens), but is not dispensed onto the paper until the nib makes contact.\n\nHow the feed is shaped may determine the wetness and flow of a particular pen. For this reason, feed material alone and its surface roughness may have a significant effect on the way two pens of the same nib size write.\n\nPen feeds are crucial to preventing ink from dripping or leaking. Feeds often feature finned structures intended for buffering fountain pen ink. Buffering is the capacity to catch and temporary hold an overflow of ink caused by other conditions than writing towards the nib. When a fountain pen nib receives such an overflow it will result in ink blobbing or dripping also known as burping. A pen with a misconfigured feed might fail to deposit any ink whatsoever.\n\nAccording to Mathur et al., \"the modern fountain pen nib may be traced back to the original gold nib which had a tiny fragment of ruby attached to form the wear-point.\" Following the discovery of the platinum group of metals which include ruthenium, osmium and iridium, \"a small quantity of iridium was isolated and used on the iridium-tipped gold dip pen nibs of the 1830s.\" Today, nibs are usually made of stainless steel or gold alloys, with the most popular gold content being 14 carat (58⅓%) and 18 carat (75%). Titanium is a less common metal used for making nibs. Gold is considered the optimum metal for its flexibility and its resistance to corrosion, although gold's corrosion resistance is less of an issue than in the past because of better stainless steel alloys and less corrosive inks.\nVisconti uses a nib made out of palladium as it is more flexible and corrosion resistant than gold.\n\nFurther gold plating provides favorable wettability, which is the ability of a solid surface to reduce the surface tension of a liquid in contact with it such that it spreads over the surface.\n\nGold and most steel and titanium nibs are tipped with a hard, wear-resistant alloy that typically includes metals from the platinum group. These metals share qualities of extreme hardness and corrosion resistance. The tipping material is often called \"iridium\", but there are few, if any, nib or pen manufacturers that used tipping alloys containing iridium metal since the mid-1950s. The metals osmium, rhenium, ruthenium and tungsten are used instead, generally as an alloy, with a little bit of osmium, rhenium, ruthenium and tungsten in a mix of other materials, produced as tiny pellets which are soldered or welded onto a nib tip prior to cutting the nib slit and grinding the tip into its final shape. Untipped steel and titanium points will wear more rapidly due to abrasion by the paper.\n\nThe nib usually has a tapering or parallel slit cut down its centre, to convey the ink down the nib by capillary action, as well as a \"breather hole\" of varying shape. The breather hole has no actual function regarding controlling the ink or air flow. Its main function is to provide an endpoint to the nib slit and forestall inaccuracies during nib slit cutting. Adding distance between the breather hole and the nib tip adds elasticity or flexibility to the nib. The breather hole also acts as a stress relieving point, preventing the nib from cracking longitudinally from the end of the slit as a result of repeated flexing during use.\n\nThe whole nib narrows to a point where the ink is transferred to the paper. Broad calligraphy pens may have several slits in the nib to increase ink flow and help distribute it evenly across the broad point. Nibs divided into three 'tines' are commonly known as music nibs. This is because their line, which can be varied from broad to fine, is suited for writing musical scores.\n\nAlthough the most common nibs end in a round point of various sizes (extra fine, fine, medium, broad), various other nib shapes are available. Examples of this are oblique, reverse oblique, stub, italic and 360-degree nibs.\n\nBroader nibs are used for less precise emphasis, with the benefit of a greater level of ink shading and/or sheen on less absorbent paper. Finer nibs (e.g. EF and F) may be used for intricate corrections and alterations, at the expense of shading and sheen. Oblique, reverse oblique, stub and italic nibs may be used for calligraphic purposes or for general handwritten compositions. The line width of a particular nib may vary based on its country of origin; Japanese nibs are often thinner in general.\n\nFlexibility is given to nibs in several ways. First, the thickness of the nib metal changes flex. When the nib alloy has been pressed thick it will result in a hard nib, while thinly pressed nibs are more flexible. Nibs can be pressed so that they are thinner at the tip and thicker at the feed to mitigate stiffness or to give a more controlled flex. Second, the curve of the nib determines in part how stiff the nib will be.\n\nNibs pressed into more deeply convex curves, or into three or five faceted curves, will be stiffer than flatter nibs. Third, the \"breather hole\" size, shape, and position alter the stiffness. Heart shaped holes will improve flex as they widen, while round, small holes stiffen the pen. Fourth, the length of the tines determines how far they can spread under pressure, shorter tines make a stiffer nib. Fifth, the alloy used can affect stiffness: as mentioned before, gold is considered superior for its flex compared to steel. Moreover, purer gold (18k and 21k) is softer than most lower gold concentration (14k) alloys.\n\nFountain pens dating from the first half of the 20th century are more likely to have flexible nibs, suited to the favored handwriting styles of the period (e.g. Copperplate script and Spencerian script). By the 1940s, writing preferences had shifted towards stiffer nibs that could withstand the greater pressure required for writing through carbon paper to create duplicate documents.\n\nFurthermore, competition between the major pen brands such as Parker and Waterman, and the introduction of lifetime guarantees, meant that flexible nibs could no longer be supported profitably. In countries where this rivalry was not present to the same degree, for example the UK and Germany, flexible nibs are more common.\n\nNowadays, stiff nibs are the norm as people exchange between fountain pens and other writing modes. These more closely emulate the ballpoint pens modern users are experienced with. Despite being rigid and firm, the idea that steel nibs write \"horribly\" is a misconception. More flexible nibs can be easily damaged by ballpoint users who write with excessive pressure. Ideally, a fountain pen's nib glides across the paper using the ink as a lubricant, and requires no pressure.\n\nGood quality nibs that have been used appropriately are long lasting, often lasting longer than the lifetime of the original owner. Many vintage pens with decades-old nibs can still be used today.\n\nOther styles of fountain pen nibs include hooded (e.g. Parker 51, Parker 61, 2007 Parker 100 and Hero 329), inlaid (e.g. Sheaffer Targa or Sheaffer P.F.M) or integral Nib (Parker T-1 and Falcon, Pilot Myu 701), which may also be ground to have different writing characteristics.\n\nUsers are often cautioned not to lend or borrow fountain pens as the nib \"wears in\" at an angle unique to each individual person. A different user is likely to find that a worn-in nib does not write satisfactorily in their hand and, furthermore, creates a second wear surface, ruining the nib for the original user. This, however, is not a point of concern in pens with modern, durable tipping material, as these pens take many years to develop any significant wear.\n\nThe reservoirs of the earliest fountain pens were mostly filled by eyedropper. This was a cumbersome and potentially messy process, which led to the commercial development of alternative methods that quickly dominated the industry. However, newer, more convenient filling mechanisms have never entirely displaced \"eyedropper-filling\" pens in the marketplace, and they remain widely manufactured today. For some the simplicity of the mechanism, coupled with the large volume of ink it can encapsulate, compensates for the inconvenience of ink transfer.\n\nAfter the eyedropper-filler era came the first generation of mass-produced self-fillers, almost all using a rubber sac to hold the ink. The sac was compressed and then released by various mechanisms to fill the pen.\n\nThe Conklin crescent filler, introduced c. 1901, was one of the first mass-produced self-filling pen designs. The crescent filling system employs an arch-shaped crescent attached to a rigid metal pressure bar, with the crescent portion protruding from the pen through a slot and the pressure bar inside the barrel. A second component, a C-shaped hard rubber ring, is located between the crescent and the barrel.\n\nOrdinarily, the ring blocks the crescent from pushing down. To fill the pen, one simply turns the ring around the barrel until the crescent matches up to the hole in the ring, allowing one to push down the crescent and squeeze the internal sac.\n\nSeveral other filling mechanisms were introduced to compete, such as the coin-filler (where a coin or 'medallion' was supplied along with the pen), match-filler (using a matchstick) and a 'blow-filler' which unsurprisingly required the pen owner to blow into the barrel to depress the internal sac.\n\nIn 1907, Walter A. Sheaffer patented the Lever filler, using a hinged lever set into the pen barrel which pressed down onto a bar which in turn compressed the rubber sac inside, creating a vacuum to force ink into the pen. Introduced in 1912, this innovation was rapidly imitated by the other major pen makers. Parker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a blind cap on the end of the barrel; when pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac.\n\nFollowing the crescent filler came a series of systems of increasing complexity, reaching their apogee in the Sheaffer Snorkel, introduced in 1952. The Sheaffer \"Snorkel\" system filled the ink sac through a retractable tube above and behind the pen point. This eliminated the need to dunk the point in ink, and the subsequent need to wipe it. With the advent of the modern plastic ink cartridge in the early 1950s, though, most of these systems were phased out in favour of convenience (but reduced capacity).\n\nScrew-mechanism piston-fillers were made as early as the 1820s, but the mechanism's modern popularity begins with the original Pelikan of 1929, based upon a Croatian patent. The basic idea is simple: turn a knob at the end of the pen, and a screw mechanism draws a piston up the barrel, sucking in ink. Thus they were easier to fill. This is also why this filling mechanism is very popular in today's fountain pens. Some of the earlier models had to dedicate as much as half of the pen length to the mechanism.\nThe advent of telescoping pistons has improved this; the Touchdown Filler was introduced by Sheaffer in 1949. It was advertised as an \"Exclusive Pneumatic Down-stroke Filler.\"\n\nTo fill it, a knob at the end of the barrel is unscrewed and the attached plunger is drawn out to its full length. The nib is immersed in ink, the plunger is pushed in, compressing and then releasing the ink sac by means of air pressure. The nib is kept in the ink for approximately 10 seconds to allow the reservoir to fill. This mechanism is very closely modeled after a similar pneumatic filler introduced by Chilton over a decade earlier.\n\nA capillary filling system was introduced by Parker in the Parker 61 in 1956. There were no moving parts: the ink reservoir within the barrel was open at the upper end, but contained a tightly rolled length of slotted, flexible plastic. To fill, the barrel was unscrewed, the exposed open end of the reservoir was placed in ink and the interstices of the plastic sheet and slots initiated capillary action, drawing up and retaining the ink. The outside of the reservoir was coated with Teflon, a repellent compound that released excess ink as it was withdrawn. Ink was transferred through a further capillary tube to the nib. No method of flushing the device was offered, and because of problems from clogging with dried and hardened ink, production was eventually stopped.\n\nAround the year 2000, Pelikan introduced a filling system involving a valve in the blind end of the pen, which mates with a specially designed ink bottle. Thus docked, ink is then squeezed into the pen barrel (which, lacking any mechanism other than the valve itself, has nearly the capacity of an eyedropper-fill pen of the same size). This system had been implemented only in their \"Level\" line, which was discontinued in 2006.\n\nMost pens today use either a piston filler, squeeze-bar filler or cartridge. Many pens are also compatible with a \"converter\", which has the same fitting as the pen's cartridge and has a filling mechanism and a reservoir attached to it. This enables a pen to either fill from cartridges, or from a bottle of ink. The most common type of converters are piston-style, but many other varieties may be found today.\nPiston-style converters generally have a transparent round tubular ink reservoir. Fountain pen inks feature differing surface tensions that can cause an ink to adhere or \"stick\" against the inside of the reservoir. Common solutions for this problem are adding a small (rust-proof) ink agitating object like a 316 or 904L stainless steel or zirconium dioxide bearing ball, spring or hollow tube in the tubular reservoir to mechanically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Adding a very small amount of surfactant like Triton X-100 used in Kodak Photo-Flo 200 wetting agent to the ink will chemically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. However ink might react adversely to adding a surfactant.\n\nVacuum fillers, such as those used by Pilot in the Custom 823, utilize air pressure to fill the ink chamber. In this case, while the nib is submerged in ink, a plunger is pushed down the empty chamber to create a vacuum in the space behind it. The end of the chamber has a section wider than the rest, and when the plunger passes this point, the difference in air pressure in the area behind the plunger and the area ahead of it is suddenly evened out and ink rushes in behind the plunger to fill the chamber.\n\nA patent for an ink cartridge system for fountain pens was filed in 1890. In the early 20th century, cartridges were made from glass and thin copper tubing. However, the concept only became successful and popular after the introduction of moulded plastic cartridges, firstly by Waterman in 1953.\nModern plastic cartridges can contain small ridges on the inside to promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Often cartridges are closed with a small ball that gets pressed into the cartridge during insertion into the pen. This ball also aids free movement of the contained ink.\n\nMost European fountain pen brands (for example Caran d'Ache, Faber-Castell, Michel Perchin, DuPont, Montegrappa, Stipula, Pelikan, Montblanc, Europen, Monteverde, Sigma, Delta, Italix and Rotring) and some pen brands of other continents (for example Acura, Bexley, Retro51, Tombow and Platinum (with adaptor)) use so called \"international cartridges\" (AKA \"European cartridges\" or \"standard cartridges\" or \"universal cartridges\"), in short (38 mm in length, about 0.75 ml of capacity) or long (72 mm, 1.50 ml) sizes, or both. It is to some extent a standard, so the international cartridges of any manufacturer can be used in most fountain pens that accept international cartridges.\n\nAlso, converters that are meant to replace international cartridges can be used in most fountain pens that accept international cartridges. Some very compact fountain pens (for example Waterman Ici et La and Monteverde Diva) accept only short international cartridges. Converters can not be used in them (except for so-called mini-converters by Monteverde). Some pens (such as the modern Waterman models) have intentional fittings which prevent the usage of short cartridges. Such pens can only take a proprietary cartridge from the same manufacturer, in this case the long Waterman cartridges.\n\nMany fountain pen manufacturers have developed their own proprietary cartridges, for example Parker, Lamy, Sheaffer, Cross, Sailor, Platinum, Platignum, Waterman and Namiki. Fountain pens from Aurora, Hero, Duke and Uranus accept the same cartridges and converters that Parker uses and vice versa (Lamy cartridges, though not officially, are known to interchange with Parker cartridges also). Cartridges of Aurora are slightly different from cartridges by Parker.\n\nCorresponding converters to be used instead of such proprietary cartridges are usually made by the same company that made the fountain pen itself. Some very compact fountain pens accept only proprietary cartridges made by the same company that made that pen, for example Sheaffer Agio Compact and Sheaffer Prelude Compact. It is not possible to use a converter in them at all. In such pens the only practical way to use another brand of ink is to fill empty cartridges with bottled ink using a syringe.\n\nStandard international cartridges are closed by a small ball, held inside the ink exit hole by glue or by a very thin layer of plastic. When the cartridge is pressed into the pen, a small pin pushes in the ball, which falls inside the cartridge. The Parker and Lamy cartridges do not have such a ball. They are closed by a piece of plastic, which is broken by a sharp pin when inserted in the pen.\n\nPen manufacturers using a proprietary cartridge (which in almost all cases are the more expensive ones like the ones mentioned above) tend to discourage the use of cheaper internationally standardised short/long cartridges or adaptations thereof due to their variance in ink quality in the cartridges which may not offer as much performance, or be of lesser quality than the manufacturer of the pen; ink that has been designed specifically for the pen. In addition, cheaper ink tends to take longer to dry on paper, may skip or produce uneven colour on the page and less \"tolerant\" on lower, thinner grades of paper (e.g. 75gs/m).\n\nWhile cartridges are mess-free and more convenient to refill than bottle filling, converter and bottle filling systems are still sold. Non-cartridge filling systems tend to be slightly more economical in the long run since ink is generally less expensive in bottles than in cartridges. Advocates of bottle-based filling systems also cite less waste of plastic for the environment, a wider selection of inks, easier cleaning of pens (as drawing the ink in through the nib helps dissolve old ink), and the ability to check and refill inks at any time.\n\nInks intended for use with fountain pens are water-based. These inks are commonly available in bottles. Plastic cartridges came into use in the 1960s, but bottled inks are still the mainstay for most fountain pen enthusiasts. Bottled inks usually cost less than an equivalent amount in cartridges and afford a wider variety of colors and properties.\n\nFountain pens are not as tightly coupled with their inks as ballpoints or gel pens are, yet some care must be taken when selecting their inks. Contemporary fountain pen inks are almost exclusively dye-based because pigment particles usually clog the narrow passages.\n\nTraditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens are not suitable for fountain pens as they will corrode the pen (a phenomenon known as flash corrosion) and destroy the functionality of the fountain pen. Instead, modern surrogate iron gall formulas are offered for fountain pens. These modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro gallic compounds, but are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still be corrosive if left in the pen for a long period. To avoid corrosion on delicate metal parts and ink clogging a more thorough than usual cleaning regime – which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water – is sometimes advised by manufacturers or resellers.\n\nSome pigmented inks do exist for fountain pens, but these are uncommon. Normal India ink cannot be used in fountain pens because it contains shellac as a binder which would very quickly clog such pens.\n\nInks ideally should be fairly free-flowing, free of sediment, and non-corrosive, though this generally excludes permanence and prevents large-scale commercial use of some colored dyes. Proper care and selection of ink will prevent most problems.\n\nWhile no longer the primary writing instrument in modern times, fountain pens are still used for important official works such as signing valuable documents. Today, fountain pens are often treated as luxury goods and sometimes as status symbols. Fountain pens may serve as an everyday writing instrument, much like the common ballpoint pen. Good quality steel and gold pens are available inexpensively today, particularly in Europe and China, and there are \"disposable\" fountain pens such as the Pilot Varsity. In France, in particular, the use of fountain pens is widespread. To avoid mistakes, special ink can be used that can be made invisible by applying an ink eraser.\n\nFountain pens can serve various artistic purposes such as expressive penmanship and calligraphy, pen and ink artwork, and professional art and design. Many users also favor the air of timeless elegance, personalization and sentimentality associated with fountain pens, which computers and ballpoint pens seem to lack, and often state that once they start using fountain pens, ballpoints become awkward to use due to the extra motor effort needed and lack of expressiveness.\n\nFor ergonomics, fountain pens may relieve physiological stress from writing; alternatives such as the ballpoint pen can induce more pain and damage to those with arthritis. Some also believe they could improve academic performance. In some countries, fountain pens are usual in lower school grades, believed to teach children better control over writing as many common mistakes of people not used to handwriting (like too much pressure or incorrect hold) feel unnatural or are almost impossible when using traditional pen tips.\n\nSome fountain pens are prized as works of art. Ornate pens may be made of precious metals and jewels with cloisonné designs. Some are inlaid with lacquer designs in a process known as maki-e. Avid communities of pen enthusiasts collect and use antique and modern pens and also collect and exchange information about old and modern inks, ink bottles, and inkwells. Collectors may decide to use the antiques in addition to showcasing them in closed spaces such as glass displays. In 2007, collectors got \"seriously hooked\" when a set of Montblancs went for $290,000 each in a fundraiser event for the Princess Grace Foundation in Monaco. Each of these Montblanc pens came with 996 diamonds and 92 rubies. It has been speculated that most collectors hail from the United States of America and China, though pen dealers in England say the trend is likely to sweep England imminently.\n\nNews outlets report that, rather than declining, fountain pen sales have been steadily rising over the last decade. There is a clear resurgence in the appeal and culture of the fountain pen, whether for purposes of collection, enjoyment or as a \"lifestyle item\". Many agree that the \"personal touch\" of a fountain pen has led to such a resurgence with modern consumers looking for an alternative in a world of digital products and services.\n\nAmazon reported \"sales so far this year [2012] have doubled compared with the same period in 2011. They are four times higher than 2010.\" The popularity of fountain pens continues to show growth. In 2017 the market-research firm Euromonitor reported that fountain pen retail sales were up 2.1% reaching $1.046 billion. \n\n\n\n\n"}

He is professor of philosophy at the University of Oslo and (one fifth time) at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He works primarily on philosophy of language and philosophical methodology and related areas in epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics. In 2013, he became editor of the journal \"Inquiry.\" Cappelen is the son of author and publisher Peder Wright Cappelen and actress Kari Simonsen.\n\nCappelen received a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford, Balliol College, in 1989. In 1996, Cappelen received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. The title of his dissertation was \"The Metaphysics of Words and the Semantics of Quotation\". His advisors were Charles Chihara, Stephen Neale, and John Searle.\n\nSince 2015, Cappelen has been Professor at the University of Oslo, where he co-directs CSMN's ConceptLab. He is running, with Øystein Linnebo and Camilla Serck-Hanssen, a project on conceptual engineering funded by a Toppforsk award from the Research Council of Norway. Prior to that, he was, since 2007, Professor and Arché chair at the University of St Andrews. He has previously held positions at Somerville College, Oxford, University of Oslo, and Vassar College. He has been the Director of the Arché Philosophical Research Centre and was co-investigator of two research projects funded by longterm AHRC grants: \"Contextualism and Relativism\" and \"Intuitions and Philosophical Methodology\". Cappelen was one of the original applicants for the research center Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature (Norwegian Centre of Excellence) at the University of Oslo. Cappelen has been a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters since 2008.\n\nCappelen's most influential work is the 2004 book, Insensitive Semantics (written with Ernie Lepore). The book defends a minimal role for context in semantics and advocates speech act pluralism. It is one of the most cited works in philosophy within the last 10 years.\n\nCappelen has argued that the role of intuition in Western analytic philosophy is overstated. His 2012 book, Philosophy without Intuitions, argues that intuition plays a minor role - or no role at all - in most modern philosophy, and the fear that intuition is widespread has been damaging. His claim that the role of intuitions is overstated is controversial, and has been hotly debated.\n\nAlong with Josh Dever, Cappelen has argued that the notion of perspective is unimportant for the philosophy of language, thought, and action. Their 2013 book \"The Inessential Indexical\" argues that the phenomena which, for example, John Perry and David Lewis think show the importance of indexical representation of the self and time can be accounted for using resources already available in the philosophy of language and thought.\n\nCappelen has also authored, or co-authored, important books on the debate between contextualists and relativists (\"Relativism and Monadic Truth\", with John Hawthorne), and on quotation (\"Language Turned on Itself\" with Ernest Lepore). Some of his papers co-written with Ernie Lepore are collected in \"Liberating Content\". He is currently writing a series of philosophy of language textbooks with Josh Dever, the first of which, \"Context and Communication\" was released in 2016.

The classification of Ikwerre as an Igbo dialect is a subject of controversy among some in the Ikwerre community due to political reasons. Based on lexicostatistical analysis, Kay Williamson originally asserted that the Ikwerre, Ekpeye, Ogba, Etche and Igbo languages belonged to the same language cluster, but were not dialects. Subsequent studies by both Williamson and Roger Blench concluded that Igbo, Ikwerre, Ogba and their sister languages apart from Ekpeye form a \"language cluster\" and that they are somewhat mutually intelligible. There are indications that the Ikwerre society was bilingual even in the pre-colonial Nigeria, with people speaking other Igbo dialects and Ikwerre.\n\nIkwerre distinguishes vowels by quality (frontedness and height), the presence or absence of nasalization, and the presence or absence of advanced tongue root.\n\nThere is also a vowel * which is posited to explain syllabic nasal consonants in accounts of the language which state that Ikwerre has no nasal stops.

The language has only 25 fluent speakers and 60 nonfluent speakers.\n\nItza' was the language of administration across much of the Yucatán Peninsula prior to 1697, when the Itza people controlled the last significant Mayan nation in Mesoamerica. During this time, the Itza people resettled their ancestral home in the Petén Basin. The subjugation of the Itza capital by the Spanish forced the Itza people to flee or live amongst the Spaniards, such as in San Jose, Guatemala, where the only modern speakers of the language live.\n\nThe modern Itza people are the last of the Lowland Maya to be able to directly trace their heritage back to the pre-Columbian era. The Itza' language reflects this history in its nomenclature for the natural world: Itza' words referring to agriculture and agricultural practices remain unchanged since first being recorded. Additionally, Itza' possesses a rich vocabulary for crops and animals that encodes specific information about different varietals and individuals of the species.\n\nItza' belongs to the Yucatecan branch of Mayan Languages. The other languages in the Yucatecan branch are Yucatec, Lacandon, and Mopan. All Yucatecan languages are closely linked with each other. However, people speaking Itza' and those speaking Yucatec have difficulties understanding each other.\nThere are 12 different branches of Mayan language, all with sub families like Itza'.\n\nThe government banned the speaking of Itzá in the 1930s and two generations of Itzá Maya have grown up learning only Spanish. The late 1980s brought an increase in interest among Maya people, including the Itzá, in preserving their cultural heritage. The Guatemalan government has set up an institution, the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala, to help develop and preserve various Mayan languages, including Itza'.\n\nItza' is spoken on the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá in San José, Petén Department, Guatemala. Among the ethnic population of 2,000, there are only 12 fluent speakers and 60 non-fluent, Spanish-Itza' bilingual speakers.\n\nThe following chart shows the consonant phonemes of Itza: Where the orthography differs from the IPA notation, the orthography used by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala is noted in bold.\n\nThe phonemes /d, g, f, v, r, ɲ/ have been adopted from Spanish and are present only in loanwords.\n\nThe following chart shows the vowel phonemes of Itza. All vowels except /ə/ have long equivalent, and vowel length is contrastive.\n\nThe Itza language does not contain tone nor pitch.\n\nPossession is marked with the same ergative particle as is used in verbal constructions. Possession constructions are marked differently based on whether the possession is inherent or non-inherent. Body parts, family members, and personal property are marked as being possessed differently than are parts of a whole. Additional possession constructions exist and are used generally where the possessor is inanimate.\n\nAll nouns in Itza' possess grammatical gender. The masculine and feminine genders are overtly marked by a prefix, while the neutral gender is unmarked. Gender is not marked on all nouns: typically, proper nouns and professions have marked gender, while other categories do not. The gender markers of Itza' also play the role of rigid designators: specific individuals across all possible worlds will have overtly marked gender, while references to classes of objects will not.\n\nItza' is an ergative-absolutive language demonstrating split ergativity. Ergative person markers indicate intransitive subjects in the imperfective aspect and all transitive subjects, while absolutive person markers indicate intransitive subjects in the perfective aspect and in dependent clauses and all objects.\n\nItza' employs the Irrealis grammatical mood to mark the future tense: the mood is coupled with a temporal adjective to form a future construction. The past tense is similarly constructed by using the Perfect tense and temporal adjectives. Similarities in the Irrealis and Perfect constructions may suggest that the Itza' consider the past and future to be similar, which reflects the Itza' worldview that time is cyclical.\n\nItza' has VOS word order, although VSO is also common and all word orders are possible. Topicalization is marked by the addition of a suffix and the movement of the topicalized word to the sentence initial position.\n\nGenerally, modifiers precede the words they modify: adjectives, numerals, determiners, and negation all follow this pattern. Possessives, demonstratives, and relative clauses all typically follow the words they modify; adjectives can also occur in this position.\n\nItza' possess a rich vocabulary of agriculture and taxonomy. Itza has specific words to encode various properties of different varietals and individuals within a species. Plants and animals of different size, color, and taste are referred to with different terms. Additionally, agricultural terms in Itza' have been virtually uninfluenced by contact with the Spanish, allowing some insight into the commonplace vocabulary of pre-contact Itza.\n\nDiscourse in Itza' is marked by its heavy use of repetition and linguistic parallelism. Words and linguistic constructions are often repeated throughout a sentence order to draw emphasis to what is being spoken. The resulting sentences are thus composed of several, complete phrases such as in the sentence:\n\nThe repetition of the pronoun \"in-ten\" and the verb \"k-im-b'el\", as well as the near-repetition of the pronoun \"eech/tech\", is typical of Itza' discourse. Such literary style is comparable to parataxis in English, a style of discourse where simple, coordinating sentences are preferred over long, subordinating sentences.\n\nDiscourse, both common and mythological, often employs framing particles—particles placed before and after a phrase in order to frame the phrase within the discourse as a whole. These particles convey the spatial and temporal relationships between new and old pieces of information in the discourse, creating larger discourse units.\n\nThe categories tense, aspect, and mood are interwoven in Itzaj Maya verbal and adverbial morphosyntax. Itzaj narrative discourse suggests a division between what a person knows from personal experience centered in one's home and town (the actual), and what is less known, but imaginable, further away in space-time.\n\n\n\n"}

It is often marked with a ceremony attended by dignitaries from the shipbuilding company and the ultimate owners of the ship.\n\nKeel laying is one of the four specially-celebrated events in the life of a ship; the others are launching, commissioning, and decommissioning.\n\nIn earlier times, the event recognized as the keel laying was the initial placement of the central timber making up the backbone of a vessel, called the keel. As steel ships replaced wooden ones, the central timber gave way to a central steel beam. Modern ships are now largely built in a series of pre-fabricated, complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel. The event recognized as the keel laying is the first joining of modular components, or the lowering of the first module into place in the building dock. It is now often called \"keel authentication\", and is the ceremonial beginning of the ship's life, although modules may have been started months before that stage of construction.\n\nKeel-related traditions from the times of wooden ships are said to bring luck to the ship during construction and to the captain and crew during her later life. They include placing a newly minted coin under the keel and constructing the ship over it, having the youngest apprentice place the coin, and when the ship is finished, presenting the owners with the oak block on which the keel is laid. The tradition of the placement of coins derives from the mast stepping custom of placing coins under the mast and is believed to date back to Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome and were intended to \"pay the ferryman\" to convey the souls of the dead across the River Styx should the ship sink.\n\nThe first milestone in the history of a ship is the generally simple ceremony that marks the laying of the keel. Invitations to the ceremony are issued by shipyard officials, and the ceremony is conducted by them. The builder may be the commander of a naval shipyard or the president of a private company. The ship's prospective name, without the \"USS\", is mentioned in the invitation, if known; otherwise her type and number are given, \"e.g.,\" DD 2217.\n"}

His book \"Sona; an auxiliary neutral language\" outlines the language's grammar and vocabulary. Encounters with Searight also influenced English author E.M. Forster's world-view, particularly with regard to soldiers.\n\nSearight was born in Kensington, England in 1883. He attended Charterhouse School (a boarding school) for his childhood and teenage years. In 1904 he received a commission into the Queen's Own Western Kent Regiment, and was stationed for several years in India. It was here that he befriended English author E.M. Forster (\"A Passage to India\") and Cambridge don G.L. Dickinson. His regiment was later reassigned to Iraq, and then to Egypt. Searight also enjoyed leave time around the Mediterranean Sea—especially in Italy.\n\nIt was during this extensive travel that Searight developed his interest in linguistics and his familiarity with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern languages and cultures. At one point in his military career he was classified as an interpreter competent in \"Arabic, Baluchi, Persian and Pushtu.\"\n\nSearight retired to Rome in 1926. In 1934 he contacted Charles Kay Ogden to discuss publishing the Sona book. Ogden was the creator of a modified version of English known as \"Basic English\", which consisted of a reduced vocabulary (only 850 words) and simplified grammar. Ogden was also the editor of the Psyche Miniatures series at Cambridge University, and he approved and published the Sona book, as well as writing an introduction for it.\n\nSearight was gay.

The language's basic sound, along with a few words, was first devised by actor James Doohan (\"Scotty\") and producer Jon Povill for \"\". That film marked the first time the language had been heard on screen. In all previous appearances, Klingons spoke in English, even to each other. Klingon was subsequently developed by Okrand into a full-fledged language.\n\nKlingon is sometimes referred to as \"Klingonese\" (most notably in the \"\" episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", where it was actually pronounced by a Klingon character as \"Klingonee\" ) but, among the Klingon-speaking community, this is often understood to refer to another Klingon language called Klingonaase that was introduced in John M. Ford's 1984 \"Star Trek\" novel \"The Final Reflection,\" and appears in other \"Star Trek\" novels by Ford.\n\nThe play \"A Klingon Christmas Carol\" is the first production that is primarily in Klingon (only the narrator speaks English). The opera \"codice_3\" is entirely in Klingon.\n\nA small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Its vocabulary, heavily centered on \"Star Trek\"-Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use.\n\nAlthough mentioned in the original \"Star Trek\" series episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", the Klingon language first appeared on-screen in \"\" (1979). According to the actor who spoke the lines, Mark Lenard, James Doohan recorded the lines he had written on a tape, and Lenard transcribed the recorded lines in a way he found useful in learning them.\n\nFor \"\" (1984), director Leonard Nimoy and writer-producer Harve Bennett wanted the Klingons to speak a structured language instead of random gibberish, and so commissioned a full language, based on the phrases Doohan had originated, from Marc Okrand, who had earlier constructed four lines of Vulcan dialogue for \"\".\n\nOkrand enlarged the lexicon and developed a grammar based on Doohan's original dozen words. The language appeared intermittently in later films featuring the original cast (for example, in \"\" (1989) and in \"\" (1991), where translation difficulties served as a plot device).\n\nTwo \"non-canon\" dialects of Klingon are hinted at in the novelization of \"\", as Saavik speaks in Klingon to the only Klingon officer aboard Cpt. Kruge's starship after his death, as the survivors of the \"Enterprise\"'s self-destruction transport up from the crumbling Genesis Planet to the Klingon ship. The surviving officer, Maltz, states that he speaks the \"Rumaiy\" dialect, while Saavik is speaking to him in the \"Kumburan\" dialect of Klingon, per Maltz's spoken reply to her.\n\nWith the advent of the series \"\" (1987)—in which one of the main characters, Worf, was a Klingon—and successors, the language and various cultural aspects for the fictional species were expanded. In the \"\" episode \"A Matter of Honor\", several members of a Klingon ship's crew speak a language that is not translated for the benefit of the viewer (even Commander Riker, enjoying the benefits of a universal translator, is unable to understand) until one Klingon orders the others to \"speak their [i.e., human] language\".\n\nA small number of non-Klingon characters were later depicted in \"Star Trek\" as having learned to speak Klingon, notably Jean-Luc Picard and Jadzia Dax.\n\nHobbyists around the world have studied the Klingon language. Six Klingon translations of works of world literature have been published: \"codice_4\" (\"the Epic of Gilgamesh\"), \"codice_5\" (\"Hamlet\"), \"codice_6\" (\"Much Ado About Nothing\"), \"codice_7\" (\"Tao Te Ching\"), \"codice_8\" (\"the Art of War\") and \"codice_9\" (\"the Little Prince\"). The Shakespearean choices were inspired by a remark from High Chancellor Gorkon in \"\", who said, \"You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.\" In the bonus material on the DVD, screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and actor William Shatner both explain that this was an allusion to the German myth that Shakespeare was in fact German.\n\nThe Klingon Language Institute exists to promote the language.\n\nCBS Television Studios owns the copyright on the official dictionary and other canonical descriptions of the language. While constructed languages (\"conlangs\") are viewed as creations with copyright protection, natural languages are not protected, excluding dictionaries and/or other works created with them. Mizuki Miyashita and Laura Moll note, \"Copyrights on dictionaries are unusual because the entries in the dictionary are not copyrightable as the words themselves are facts, and facts can not be copyrighted. However, the formatting, example sentences, and instructions for dictionary use are created by the author, so they are copyrightable.\"\n\nOkrand had studied some Native American and Southeast Asian languages,<ref>\n"}

The first worldwide 3D lenticular printed book with the story is Lentibook Pirate Girl.\n\nLenticular printing technology and stereoscopy is a complicated method of producing imagery that allows spatial visual perception. There are different types of lenticular printing, the technology has evolved from simpler to more complex methods. Initially, it was a combination of two alternating images. With this basic application lenticular printing can be found, for example, child rulers with varying images depending on the inclination of rulers and angle of view. Gradually the technology has been better and better and allows the creation of images with stereoscopic 3D effects that are used such as posters, billboards or postcards. This advanced technological process stereoscopic 3D effect is used in the production of lenticular book.\n\nCurrently lenticular book develops as a modern version of the classic children's book, which offers a varied, entertaining and inspiring imagery that develops a child's imagination. With emerging technology is evolving quality lenticular images in the book, which are still better and more varied. This makes it possible to use 3D book seizure of the child, but also as a teaching tool that motivates and leads to reading and concentration.\n\nProduction of images with the 3D effect is very demanding in terms of complexity of technological processes and in terms of time and money.

{"id": "3136742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3136742", "title": "Lexis (linguistics)", "text": "Lexis (linguistics)\n\nIn generative linguistics, a lexis or lexicon is the complete set of all possible words in a language (vocabulary). In this sense, \"child\", \"children\", \"child's\" and \"children's\" are four different words in the English lexicon.\nIn systemic-functional linguistics, a lexis or lexical item is the way one calls a particular thing or a type of phenomenon. Since a lexis from a systemic-functional perspective is a way of calling, it can be realised by multiple grammatical words such as \"The White House\", \"New York City\" or \"heart attack\". Moreover, since a lexis is a way of calling, different words such as \"child\", \"children\", \"child's\" and \"children's\" may realise the same lexical item.\n\nIn short, the lexicon is:\n\n\nA major area of study, psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, involves the question of how words are retrieved from the mental lexicon in online language processing and production. For example, the cohort model seeks to describe lexical retrieval in terms of segment-by-segment activation of competing lexical entries.\n\nIn recent years, the compilation of language databases using real samples from speech and writing has enabled researchers to take a fresh look at the composition of languages. Among other things, statistical research methods offer reliable insight into the ways in which words interact. The most interesting findings have taken place in the dichotomy between language use (how language is used) and language usage (how language could be used).\n\nLanguage use shows which occurrences of words and their partners are most probable. The major finding of this research is that language users rely to a very high extent on ready-made language \"lexical chunks\", which can be easily combined to form sentences. This eliminates the need for the speaker to analyse each sentence grammatically, yet deals with a situation effectively. Typical examples include \"I see what you mean\" or \"Could you please hand me the...\" or \"Recent research shows that...\"\n\nLanguage usage, on the other hand, is what takes place when the ready-made chunks do not fulfill the speaker's immediate needs; in other words, a new sentence is about to be formed and must be analyzed for correctness. Grammar rules have been internalised by native speakers, allowing them to determine the viability of new sentences. Language usage might be defined as a fall-back position when all other options have been exhausted.\n\nWhen analyzing the structure of language statistically, a useful place to start is with high frequency context words, or so-called Key Word in Context (KWICs). After millions of samples of spoken and written language have been stored in a database, these KWICs can be sorted and analyzed for their co-text, or words which commonly co-occur with them. Valuable principles with which KWICs can be analyzed include:\n\n\nOnce data has been collected, it can be sorted to determine the probability of co-occurrences. One common and well-known way is with a concordance: the KWIC is centered and shown with dozens of examples of it in use, as with the example for \"possibility\" below.\n\nOnce such a concordance has been created, the co-occurrences of other words with the KWIC can be analyzed. This is done by means of a t-score. If we take for example the word \"stranger\" (comparative adjective and noun), a t-score analysis will provide us with information such as word frequency in the corpus: words such as \"no\" and \"to\" are not surprisingly very frequent; a word such as \"controversy\" much less. It then calculates the occurrences of that word together with the KWIC (\"joint frequency\") to determine if that combination is unusually common, in other words, if the word combination occurs significantly more often than would be expected by its frequency alone. If so, the collocation is considered strong, and is worth paying closer attention to.\n\nIn this example, \"no stranger to\" is a very frequent collocation; so are words such as \"mysterious\", \"handsome\", and \"dark\". This comes as no surprise. More interesting, however, is \"no stranger to controversy\". Perhaps the most interesting example, though, is the idiomatic \"perfect stranger\". Such a word combination could not be predicted on its own, as it does not mean \"a stranger who is perfect\" as we should expect. Its unusually high frequency shows that the two words collocate strongly and as an expression are highly idiomatic.\n\nThe study of corpus linguistics provides us with many insights into the real nature of language, as shown above. In essence, the lexicon seems to be built on the premise that language use is best approached as an assembly process, whereby the brain links together ready-made chunks. Intuitively this makes sense: it is a natural short-cut to alleviate the burden of having to \"re-invent the wheel\" every time we speak. Additionally, using well-known expressions conveys loads of information rapidly, as the listener does not need to break down an utterance into its constituent parts. In \"Words and Rules\", Steven Pinker shows this process at work with regular and irregular verbs: we collect the former, which provide us with rules we can apply to unknown words (for example, the \"‑ed\" ending for past tense verbs allows us to decline the neologism \"to google\" into \"googled\"). Other patterns, the irregular verbs, we store separately as unique items to be memorized.\n\nAnother method of effective language storage in the Lexicon includes the use of metaphor as a storage principle. (\"Storage\" and \"files\" are good examples of how human memory and computer memory have been linked to the same vocabulary; this was not always the case). George Lakoff's work is usually cited as the cornerstone to studies of metaphor in the language. One example is quite common: \"time is money\". We can save, spend and waste both time and money. Another interesting example comes from business and sex: businesses penetrate the market, attract customers, and discuss \"relationship management\". Business is also war: launch an ad campaign, gain a foothold (already a climbing metaphor in military usage) in the market, suffer losses. Systems, on the other hand, are water: a flood of information, overflowing with people, flow of traffic. The NOA theory of Lexicon acquisition argues that the metaphoric sorting filter helps to simplify language storage and avoid overload.\n\nComputer research has revealed that grammar, in the sense of its ability to create entirely new language, is avoided as far as possible. Biber and his team working at the University of Arizona on the Cobuild GSWE noted an unusually high frequency of word bundles that, on their own, lack meaning. But a sample of one or two quickly suggests their function: they can be inserted as grammatical glue without any prior analysis of form. Even a cursory observation of examples reveals how commonplace they are in all forms of language use, yet we are hardly aware of their existence. Research suggests that language is heavily peppered with such bundles in all registers; two examples include \"do you want me to\", commonly found in speech, or \"there was no significant\" found in academic registers. Put together in speech, they can create comprehensible sentences, such as \"I'm not sure\" + \"if they're\" + \"they're going\" to form \"I'm not sure if they're going\". Such a sentence eases the burden on the Lexicon as it requires no grammatical analysis whatsoever.\n\nBritish linguist Michael K. Halliday proposes a useful dichotomy of spoken and written language which actually entails a shift in paradigm: while linguistic theory posits the superiority of spoken language over written language (as the former is the origin, comes naturally, and thus precedes the written language), or the written over the spoken (for the same reasons: the written language being the highest form of rudimentary speech), Halliday states they are two entirely different entities.\n\nHe claims that speech is grammatically complex while writing is lexically dense. In other words, a sentence such as \"a cousin of mine, the one about whom I was talking the other day—the one who lives in Houston, not the one in Dallas—called me up yesterday to tell me the very same story about Mary, who...\" is most likely to be found in conversation, not as a newspaper headline. \"Prime Minister vows conciliation\", on the other hand, would be a typical news headline. One is more communicative (spoken), the other is more a recording tool (written).\n\nHalliday's work suggests something radically different: language behaves in registers. Biber et al. working on the LGSWE worked with four (these are not exhaustive, merely exemplary): conversation, literature, news, academic. These four registers clearly highlight distinctions within language use which would not be clear through a \"grammatical\" approach. Not surprisingly, each register favors the use of different words and structures: whereas news headline stories, for example, are grammatically simple, conversational anecdotes are full of lexical repetition. The lexis of the news, however, can be quite dense, just as the grammar of speech can be incredibly complicated.\n"}

Govinda Pai\n\nManjeshwar Govinda Pai (23 March 1883 – 6 September 1963), also known as Rastrakavi Govinda Pai, was a Kannada poet. He was awarded the first Rashtrakavi title by the Madras Government (Kasaragod district was part of South Kanara district of Madras Presidency prior to the linguistic reorganisation of States on 1 November 1956). Rashtrakavi M. Govinda Pai was the one who put Manjeshwaram ( Kerala) on the literary map of India.\n\nM. Govinda Pai was born on 23 March 1883 in a Konkani Goud Saraswat Brahmin family at his maternal grandfather's house in Manjeshwar. He was the first son of Mangalore Sahukaar Thimmappa Pai and Devaki Amma. Govinda Pai went to school in Mangalore. For college education, Pai went to Madras (Chennai). Due to the sudden death of his father, he had to return.\nGovinda Pai was also a prolific prose writer. His earliest composition in prose was \"Srikrishna Charita\" (1909) which makes for remarkable reading. Govinda Pai narrated the story of Christ's crucifixion in his work \"Golgotha\" (1931). The next three panegyrics published by him; Vaishakhi, Prabhasa and Dehali, narrated the last days of the Buddha, God Krishna and Gandhi respectively; were a result of the huge success of Golgotha. His best works written in blank verse, viz., \"Golgotha\" (\"The last days of Christ\", published in 1937), \"Vaisakhi \" (\"The last days of Buddha\", published in 1946) and \"Hebberalu\" (\"The Thumb\", the story of Ekalavya retold, published in 1946) have won a lasting place in the gallery of the greatest poets of Kannada literature. \"Gommata Jinastuti\" was his first published work. He introduced the sonnet form into Kannada. Hebberalu dramatises the story of Drona and Ekalavya, characters from the epic Mahabharata.\n\nGovinda Pai also enriched Kannada learning with his historical studies and research. He was an authority on the chronology and history of Tulunad. His works also testify to his universal outlook as well as to his deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden.\n\nHe was able to read and write fluently in 25 languages including Tulu, Malayalam, Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Persian, Pali, Urdu, Greek and Japanese apart from Kannada, Konkani and English. He translated several Japanese works into Kannada.\n\nHis poems are...\n\nHis other works include\n\nIn 1949, the then Madras Government conferred on him the Rashtrakavi award. He was the president of Kannada Sahitya Sammelana at Bombay in 1951.\n\nOn his 125th birth anniversary, a national award was instituted in his name and his old house at Manjeshwar is mooted to be a national monument.\n\nIn Udupi near his native place, the Govind Pai Research Institute is established near MGM College of Dr. T.M.A Pai Foundation of Manipal institutions. Other centres in the vicinity are Yakshagana & Janapada Samshodhana Kendra, Kanakadasa Peetha and Tulu lexicon project.\n\nGovind Pai was also acknowledged by the government of Kerala. The Govind Pai Memorial College is a part of Kannur University in Manjeswar is a testimonial for this.\n\nGovind Pai attended the Intermediate Course at Government College, Mangalore. It was here that he had Panje Mangesh Rao as one of his teachers. Panje was another pioneer of the Modern Kannada literary renaissance. Govind Pai had once asked Panje for the text of two songs which Panje used to recite. Panje used to borrow literary journals from Govind Pai, who, even as a lad of 13, had developed a taste for books and had started subscribing to literary journals.\n\nOn the occasion of Govind Pai's 125th birthday celebration at Manjeshwar, the foundation stone for the 'Gilivindu Project' was laid. The Union government and state governments of Kerala and Karnataka jointly took the initiative to build a memorial by planning a project called 'Gilivindu' at an estimated cost of Rs 20 million, which will consist of an open amphitheater, venue for staging plays, art exhibitions, Yakshagana, library section, preservation of manuscripts, research, comparative studies, archives, guest house for scholars etc.\n\nThe Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) foundation would meet the expenses to renovate the Govinda Pai memorial building into a museum, library and an auditorium. The initiative was part of the ‘Gulivindu’ project, launched by the Kerala and Karnataka governments, to develop the poet’s ancestral house here into a national level centre of literature, culture, and research.\n\nThough Govind Pai today exists for us in the form of his poems, plays essays and such other literary and non-literary works, his life was so full of events and his personality so impressive and his accomplishments were so various that they have been recorded by many writers who were captivated by them and these records also recreate his life for us. Govind pai's circle of friends and readers was so large that in the commemoration volume brought out in Kundapur in the year 1965 no fewer than 70 writers, all eminent and didstinguished writers in their own merit, sketched the remarkable qualities of the genius that Govind pai was. Govind pai's rich personality, reflected in his works, gets further focus in these reminiscences.\n\nPoetic composition in Kannada was largely conventional around the turn of the century. On the prescription of all poets invariably used to maintain the initial rhyme in versification. Govind Pai too adhered to this practice in the early stages of his career. His first poem \"Suvasini\" was published in the journal of the same name The first poems to be published in \"Swadeshabhimani\" were \"Subhadra Vilapa\" and \"Kaliya Mardana\". These poems had the initial rhyme. These rhymed poems were published in the journal Swadeshabhimani from 1903 to 1910.\n\nBut slowly Govind Pai began to ask whether initial rhyme was so essential to poetry. Sanskrit poetry and English poetry did not have this element but that did not detract from their merit. Once Govind Pai made bold to ask Panje Mangesh Rao about his opinion on giving up rhyme. He seemed to imply that writing without rhyme meant a lack of poetic skill. Govind Pai was not satisfied with the response. But he still hesitated to deviate from the trodden path. Some poems which he wrote without rhyme he destroyed. But when he was in Baroda in 1911 he finally made up his mind to renounce rhyme. But today Govind Pai's route of deviation has become the royal path.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31806482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31806482", "title": "Malayalam grammar", "text": "Malayalam grammar\n\nMalayalam is one of the Dravidian languages and as such has an agglutinative grammar. The word order is generally subject–object–verb, although other orders are often employed for reasons such as emphasis. Nouns are inflected for case and number, whilst verbs are conjugated for tense, mood and causativity (and also in archaic language for person, gender, number and polarity). Being the linguistic successor of the macaronic Manipravalam, Malayalam grammar is based on Sanskrit too.\n\nThe declensional paradigms for some common nouns and pronouns are given below. As Malayalam is an agglutinative language, it is difficult to delineate the cases strictly and determine how many there are, although seven or eight is the generally accepted number. Alveolar plosives and nasals (although the modern Malayalam script does not distinguish the latter from the dental nasal) are marked with a macron below, following the convention of the National Library at Kolkata romanization.\n\nVocative forms are given in parentheses after the nominative, as the only pronominal vocatives that are used are the third person ones, which only occur in compounds.\n\nThe following are examples of some of the most common declensional patterns.\n\nThere are basically two genres of Sandhi used in Malayalam - one group unique to Malayalam, and other one common with Sanskrit. Thus, we have the \"Malayala Sandhi\" and \"Samskrita Sandhi\".\n\nThere are basically four Sandhi types unique to Malayalam - the \"lōpa sandhi\", \"dvitva sandhi\", \"āgama sandhi\" and \"ādēśa sandhi\".\n\nThe Lopa sandhi occurs when the varna at the end of a word is lost when it merges with another word. In most cases, the varna is the \"samvr̥tōkāram\". (the \"closed u sound\")\n\nExample : atŭ + illa = atilla.\nകണ്ടു ഇല്ല = കണ്ടില്ല,അത് ആയതു= അതായത്\n\nIn Malayalam, germination is more in tense consonants and less in lax consonants. When two words combine in which the first is the qualifier and the qualified, the tense consonants initial to the second word germinates.\n\nExample : pōyi + paraññu = pōyipparaññu\nപോയി + പറഞ്ഞു = പോയിപ്പറഞ്ഞു\n\nWhen two vowels undergo Sandhi, a consonant (\"y\" or \"v\") arrives extra to avoid the pronunciation difficulty.\n\nExample : vazhi + ampalam = vazhiyampalam.\nവഴി + അമ്പലം = വഴിയമ്പലം\n\nIn this Sandhi, one letter is substituted by another during concatenation.\n\nExample : viṇ + talam = viṇṭalam\nവിൺ + തലം = വിണ്ടലം (t replaced by ṭ)\n\nThis sandhi is also includes Sanskrit Sandhi forms like vi + samam = viṣamam.\n\nThese Sandhi rules are basically inherited from Sanskrit, and are used in concatenation of Sanskrit vocabulary which form more than 80% of Malayalam. The rules like savarṇadīrgha sandhi, yaṇ sandhi, guṇa sandhi, vr̥ddhi sandhi and visarga sandhis are used without changes.\n\nAll the Sanskrit samāsa rules are adapted to Malayalam compounds. In Malayalam, the tatpurusha compounds are classified according to the vibhakti they are based on, during compounding. The \"alaṅkāraṁ\" is also used to classify tatpurusha compounds.There are 4 type of samasam-1)aavyayi bhavan 2) thalpurusha 3) dvandan 4) bahuvrihi\n\nThe vr̥ttaṁ consists of metres of Malayalam prosody. Like Sandhi, there are specific vr̥ttaṁs unique to Malayalam apart from the metres common with Sanskrit. As in case of Sandhi, the Malayalam vrittams are also named in Sanskrit.\n\nAlaṅkāraṁ or \"ornamentation\" is also based on Sanskritic grammarian classification. It consists of the different figures of speech used in Malayalam poetry. Being successor to Sanskrit and Manipravalam, most of Sanskrit alankaras are used in Malayalam. Thus, the common figures of speech in poems are rūpakaṁ, utprēkṣā, upamā etc.\n\nWhen words are adopted from Sanskrit, their endings are usually changed to conform to Malayalam norms:\n\n1. Masculine Sanskrit nouns with a Word stem ending in a short \"a\" take the ending \"an\" in the nominative singular. For example, Kr̥ṣṇa -> Kr̥ṣṇan. The final \"n\" is dropped before masculine surnames, honorifics, or titles ending in \"an\" and beginning with a consonant other than \"n\" – e.g. Krishna Menon, Krishna Kaniyaan etc., but Krishnan Ezhutthachan. Surnames ending with \"ar\" or \"aḷ\" (where these are plural forms of \"an\" denoting respect) are treated similarly – Krishna Pothuval, Krishna Chakyar, but Krishnan Nair, Krishnan Nambiar, as are Sanskrit surnames such \"Varma(n)\", \"Sharma(n)\", or \"Gupta(n)\" (rare) – e.g. Krishna Varma, Krishna Sharman. If a name is a compound, only the last element undergoes this transformation – e.g. Kr̥ṣṇa + dēva = Kr̥ṣṇadēvan, not Kr̥ṣṇandēvan.\n\n2. Feminine words ending in a long \"ā\" or \"ī\" are changed so that they now end in a short \"a\" or \"i\", for example Sītā -> Sīta and Lakṣmī -> Lakṣmi. However, the long vowel still appears in compound words, such as Sītādēvi orLakṣmīdēvi. The long ī is generally reserved for the vocative forms of these names, although in Sanskrit the vocative actually takes a short \"i\". There are also a small number of nominative \"ī\" endings that have not been shortened – a prominent example being the word \"strī\" \"woman\".\n\n3. Nouns that have a stem in -an and which end with a long \"ā\" in the masculine nominative singular have a \"vŭ\" added to them, for exampleBrahmā (stem Brahman) -> Brahmāvŭ. When the same nouns are declined in the neuter and take a short \"a\" ending in Sanskrit, Malayalam adds an additional \"m\", e.g. Brahma (neuter nominative singular of Brahman) becomes Brahmam. This is again omitted when forming compounds.\n\n4. Words whose roots end in -an but whose nominative singular ending is -a – for example, the Sanskrit root of \"Karma\" is actually \"Karman\" –are also changed. The original root is ignored and \"Karma\" (the form in Malayalam being \"Karmam\" because it ends in a short \"a\") is taken as the basic form of the noun when declining. However, this does not apply to all consonant stems, as \"unchangeable\" stems such as \"manasa\" (\"mind\") and \"suhr̥ta (friend)\" are identical to the Malayalam nominative singular forms (although the regularly derived \"manam\" sometimes occurs as an alternative to \"manasa\").\n5. Sanskrit words describing things or animals rather than people with a stem in short \"a\" end with an \"m\" Malayalam. For example, Rāmāyaṇa -> Rāmāyaṇam. In most cases, this is actually the same as the Sanskrit ending, which is also \"m\" (or allophonically anusvara due to Sandhi) in the neuter nominative. However, \"things and animals\" and \"people\" are not always differentiated based on whether or not they are sentient beings – for example Narasimha becomes Narasiṃham and not Narasiṃhan, whereas Ananta becomes Anantan even though both are sentient. This does not strictly correspond to the Sanskrit neuter gender, as both \"Narasiṃha\" and \"Ananta\" are masculine nouns in the original Sanskrit.\n\n6. Nouns with short vowel stems other than \"a\", such as \"Viṣṇu\", \"Prajāpati\" etc. are declined with the Sanskrit stem acting as the Malayalam nominative singular (the Sanskrit nominative singular is formed by adding a visarga, e.g. Viṣṇuḥ) \n\n7. The original Sanskrit vocative is often used in formal or poetic Malayalam, e.g. \"Harē\" (for Hari) or \"Prabhō\" (for \"Prabhu\" – \"lord\"). This is restricted to certain contexts – mainly when addressing deities or other exalted individuals, so a normal man named Hari would usually be addressed using a Malayalam vocative such as \"Harī\". The Sanskrit genitive is also occasionally found in Malayalam poetry, especially the personal pronouns \"mama\" (my/ mine) and \"tava\" (thy/ thine). Other cases are less common and generally restricted to the realm of Maṇipravāḷam. \n\n8. Along with these tatsama borrowings, there are also many tadbhava words in common use. These were borrowed into Malayalam before it became distinct from Tamil. As the language did not then accommodate Sanskrit phonology as it now does, words were changed to conform to the Old Tamil phonological system. For example: Kr̥ṣṇa -> Kaṇṇan.\n\n 3.

Singaravelu and Singaravelar, was a pioneer in more than one field in India. In 1918, he founded the first trade union in India. On 1 May 1923 he organised the first ever celebration of May Day in the country. Singaravelar was a major leader of the Indian independence movement, initially under the leadership of Gandhi, but later, joining the budding communist movement. In 1925, he became one of the founding fathers of the Communist Party of India; and chaired its inaugural convention in Kanpur. Though the British Government arrested him along with other leaders on charges of conspiring to wage war against the Crown, he was set free, soon after, on account of his failing health.\nSingaravelar was also a path-breaking social reformer who in his early life took to Buddhism, seeing it as a weapon against the evil of untouchability, which was particularly severe in the 19th-century India. He was also in the forefront of Self respect movement, in the Madras Presidency that fought for equal rights for backward castes. Though in his advanced years, he withdrew from active politics, Singaravelar remained a staunch advocate of the causes he had pioneered till his death at the age of 85.\n\nSingaravelar was born in a Fishermen family, the third son of Venkatachalam and Valliammai in Madras (now called Chennai). He matriculated in 1881 and then, from Madras Christian College, he passed F.A. (First examination in Arts) in 1884. Singaravelar took his bachelor's degree from the Presidency College under the Madras University. He joined the Madras Law College and got his B.L. degree in 1907. Thereafter Singaravelar practised law at the Madras High Court.\n\nIn 1889, Singaravelar married Angammal. Their only daughter was Kamala. Seetha, his grand-niece, married Philip Spratt in 1939. Singaravelar was successful as a lawyer; within a short period, he earned enough wealth to acquire estates in Madras town and suburbs.\n\nAround this time,Singaravelar had shown growing willingness to combat social evils such as untouchability. The leading voice of the oppressed classes at the end of the 19th century was Iyothee Thass(also referred to as Pandit C. Ayodhya Dasa and Iyothi Thass) (1845–1914). He was born into a fisherman family(most backward caste) and had concluded that rationalist ideas of Buddhism could be used as a weapon against untouchability. He and other oppressed class people from Tamil Nadu decided thence forth to call themselves Buddhist, and live accordingly. In 1890 he started Sakya Buddhist Society and later in 1900, South Indian Buddhist Association in Madras. Influenced by Iyothee Thass, Singaravelar also became growingly open to Buddhist ideas.\n\nAnagarika Dharmapala, the Ceylonese Buddhist missionary founded the Maha Bodhi society for revival of Buddhism in 1891. Iyothee Thass and Col. Olcott of the Theosophical Society, Adyar in Madras, wanted to convene a meeting on Dharmapala's arrival in Madras. The meeting that took place on 8 August 1898 was held at Royapettah house of Singaravelar. Later on 28 September the Madras branch of the Maha Bodhi Society was inaugurated in the presence of a large gathering.\nAt this meeting a resolution was moved by Singaravelar to form, in Madras, the first branch of the Maha Bodhi Society.\nMuch later, in 1923, when Singaravelar issued the manifesto of his newly formed Party Labour and Kishan Party of Hindusthan, he signed it as 'M. Singaravelu (\"Indian communist\") President, Madras Maha Bodhi Society'.\n\nIn the history of working class movement in India, Madras came to occupy an important place when, within six months of the Russian Revolution, Singaravelar, on 27 April 1918, formed the first trade union in India, called the Madras Labor Union of the British-owned Buckingham & Carnatic Mills. Chettiiar became its first president. Singaravelar and other activists of the period, like Thiru Vi Ka (Tamil for 'Mr. V. K.' – standing for Mr. V. Kalyanasundaram) organised more unions such as M.S.M. Workers Union, Electricity Workers Union, Tramway Workers Union, Petroleum Employees Union, Printing Workers Union, Aluminium Workers Union, Railway Employees Union, Coimbatore Weavers Union and Madurai Weavers Union.\n\nFrom their inception trade unions in Madras were drawn into long, and often bloody, confrontations with the management. According to the noted economist Amiya Kumar Bagchi, Madras had led the trade union movement with the organisation of workers into Madras Labour Union, but the movement could not flourish in a region with abundant labour, slow industrial growth and employees who were determined not to make any concession to labour organisations.\n\nBuckingham & Carnatic Mills workers' strike is a case in point. The management of the Mills did not even concede workers right to combine. The union was banned by the British authorities. A flash point occurred when a British manager threatened workers with a gun, which was snatched by workers and started firing back. The police came and opened fire killing two young workers.\n\nSingaravelar, Thiru Vi Ka, and other leaders called for a strike on 21 June 1921. The management retaliated by instigating a caste war through recruitment of workers from 'low' castes to fill the strikers' vacancies. The strike turned into a caste war between two warring groups. On 29 August 1921, police firing near the Mills' premises in Perambur, near Madras, killed seven people. When their funeral procession was taken out some miscreants threw stones, leading to another round of caste violence. Two more firings – on 19 September and 15 October 1921 followed. After six months, the strike came to an end, failing to meet any of its objectives. From then Singaravelar started seeking political backing for the working class movement.\n\nAluminium workers in Madras struck work in July 1922. Singaravelar speaking in Tamil Nadu Congress Committee meeating in September 1922 said that the Indian National Congress should take up the cause of labour. Later he led a strike of workers of Addisons press. in December 1922 he was in the forefront of Madras Tramways workers strike.Singaravelar also presided over the strike of 30 August 1924 by the scavengers of Madras Corporation.\n\nSingaravelar attracted the attention of the émigré Communist Party of India, which was founded by M. N. Roy, Shaukat Usmani and others in Tashkent on 17 October 1920. Describing the formation of earliest communist groups in India, S. A. Dange is quoted as below: The Tashkent Party (ie. CPI) and the Executive Committee of the Communist International tried to build contacts independently and through me with communist group in Calcutta led by Muzaffar Ahmed and the group in Madras led by Singaravelu Chettiar. Abani Mukherji, a close associate of M.N. Roy, smuggled himself to India from Moscow via Berlin in December 1922 and surreptitiously met local communist leaders. After meeting Dange at the Gaya session of the Congress in December 1922, and meeting Bengal communist groups, Mukherji moved to Madras and met Singaravelar. Mukherji helped him with his efforts to form Hindustan Labour Kishan Party and also to draw up its manifesto. Earlier Singaravelar had met Dange at the Gaya session of the Congress.\n\nWhen Gandhi launched non-cooperation movement starting from September 1920 to February 1922 Singaravelar accepted Gandhi's leadership and became one of the influential leaders of the Presidency Congress Party. He set fire to his lawyer's gown at a public meeting in May 1921 as symbolic of boycotting the British courts. In May 1921, he wrote a letter to Mahatma Gandhi explaining his action, \"I have given up my profession as a lawyer today. I shall follow you as you strive for the people of this country.\"\n\nAn important event of the period was the visit of Prince of Wales and his consort to India. When they came to Madras, Singaravelar organised the boycott of the delegation through an unprecedented \"hartal\" or complete shutdown of shops and establishments of the town. The shutdown was complete, but there were instances of compulsion.\n\nGandhi in an article in \"Young India\", dated 9 February 1922 criticized the hartal and Singaravelar for not imbibing the true spirit of non-cooperation movement. He quoted a letter from one of his disciples, Dr. Rajan:\n\nJust two days ago, Mr. Singaravelu Chettiar, president Madras District\nCongress Council, held a public meeting on the Madras beach. The first\nresolution congratulated the citizens of Madras on their successful hartal and\nthe second resolution condemned the excesses committed that day.\nI wired to Mr. Singaravelu not to have this ugly meeting but\nevidently no notice seems to have been taken of it\n\nGandhi's comment on the passage was,The confession, therefore, that Dr. Rajan has made is an\ninvigorating process. It strengthens him and the cause for which he\nstands. Non-co-operation is a vicious and corrupt doctrine, truly an\n\"ugly\" word, if it does not mean down-right self-purification.\nStubborn and implacable resistance against internal corruption is\nenough resistance against the Government.\n\nWhen the Indian National Congress met in Gaya, in 1922,Singaravelar participated, seeing himself as a representative of workers. He spoke in favour of labour legislation and felt that the labour movement in India must be a part of the congress movement. M. N. Roy praised him for calling himself a communist,in \"Vanguard\" dated 1 March 1923 That Singaravelu participated in the Gaya Congress Meeting in which people with different ideas took part will be considered a historic event. When many leaders were afraid that their honour and respect as important leaders will be lost and young men were afraid of the steps that the government would take, this sixty-year-old grey-haired elder called him a communist\". It is impossible not to praise him. The theme of his speech was that \"it is necessary approach the workers personally and make Trade Unions a part of the Congress.\" Following his speech, the Gaya meeting adopted the Labor Resolution that said,\nIt is the opinion of this conference that all Indian Labourers should be united. To safeguard their rights and prevent their exploitation and for equal distribution of wealth among all, the various labour and kisan unions should be unified and for this purpose, a committee of six has been constituted.\n\nOn 1 May 1923, Singaravelar founded the Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan(a party of workers and peasants) in Madras. The foundation ceremony was purposefully kept on the May Day; and for the first time in India, under the auspices of the newly formed party, the day was observed as International Workers' Day. On that occasion, again for the first time the red flag was used in India. Singaravelar made arrangements to celebrate the May Day in two places in the One meeting was held at the beach opposite to the Madras High Court; the other was held at the Triplicane beach. The Hindu newspaper, published from Madras reported, The Labour Kisan party has introduced May Day celebrations in Chennai. Comrade Singaravelar presided over the meeting. A resolution was passed stating that the government should declare May Day as a holiday. The president of the party explained the non-violent principles of the party. There was a request for financial aid. It was emphasised that workers of the world must unite to achieve independence.\n\nLabour Kishan Party of Hindusthan was a part of a larger, but not inter-connected, moves by various Indian communist groups to find a mass-based political platform. Dange, for instance, wrote to M. N. Roy of the émigré Communist Party of India and a leader of the Comintern, regarding his desire to start a Socialist Labour Party of India. In reply, Roy explained the relation between émigré Communist Party of India and 'mass party of revolutionary nationalist struggle',and further said that \"each of the Indian \"centres\" produced a separate scheme and it was some time before they could agree to combine.\" Roy was probably referring to Singaravelar's proposal to start a similar party. Same year Dange wrote in his journal \"Socialist\" that all his activities were now a part of the Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan and he asked for opening up of its branches everywhere.\n\nSingaravelar announced that it would join the Indian National Congress and would strive to function as the labour and farmer wing of that party. Labour Kishan Party was a precursor to Workers and Peasants Party of 1925 that would function within the Congress, as a left wing platform for the same. In the manifesto of the party Singaravelar described Congress 'our chief political organ, appear to define \"nation\" by referring to propertied class.\n\nIn December 1923 Singaravelar started a fortnightly journal called \"The Labour Kisan Gazette\". Singaravelar also started the Tamil Weekly \"Thozhilalar\" in which he wrote about the working class movements spreading in various parts of the world during the early part of the 1920s.\n\nIn 1925, Singaravelar was elected as a member of the Madras Corporation. On Singaravelar's initiative first ever mid-day meal scheme was introduced in Madras for providing cooked meals to children in corporation schools.\n\nIn the Gaya congress session of 1922, the president of the session, C. R. Das moved a resolution for 'Council-Entry programme,' that is, 'Non-Cooperation from within the Councils.' He however met with vehement opposition from the Mahatma and the 'no-changers'. C. Rajagopalachari led the Council-Entry opposition. The resolution lost. M. N. Roy wrote,It has been proved at Gaya, if proof were still needed, that the National. struggle can be led, neither by the reactionary petty-bourgeoisie acting through the orthodox “No-Changers” under the divine guidance of St. Rajagopal, nor by the radical intellectuals desirous of harking back to the folds of Constitutionalism, under the guise of loyalty to the memory of Tilak. Between these two centripetal forces, Bengal's “Sentimental Tommy”(C.R. Das) croaked. Before he could wreck the Councils, the Councils wrecked him.\n\nWhat is to be done? A new party must be organised. Early communists like Dange, Singaravelar, M. N. Roy's associate, Abani Mukherji, a deportee from Fiji and a lawyer Manilal Doctor were present at the Gaya session and saw Gandhi's support to the 'no-changers.' Efforts to form a unified platform intensified.\n\nOn 29 January 1923, Dange wrote to Singaravelar that, You perhaps know that Roy wants to hold a conference of Indian Communists in Berlin. I think it is a mad venture Indians to go hunting Communism in European Conference, whatever has to be done must be done in India.\n\nIn January 1924 the Government of India compiled a brief on activities of communists in India. The Government Counsel recommended prosecution against the first eight in the list, namely, M. N. Roy, Muzaffar Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani Gulam Hussain, S. A. Dange, Singaravelu, Ramcharan Lal Sharma and Nalini Gupta. But no recommendations were made against S. D. Hussain, M. P. T. Velayudham (an associate of Singaravelar), Sampurnand, Manilal Doctor and Satya Bhakta. The report was submitted to the Governor General and on further legal scrutiny some lacunae were found. The scope of the case was revised to bring in a conspiracy angle: that the Third Communist International had appointed Roy as its agent and had instructed him to establish a communist party with the help of Shaukat Usmani, S. A. Dange, Singaravelu, Gulam Hussain and Muzaffar Ahmed.\n\nAs the charges were getting framed Dange and Singaravelar were arrested under Regulation III of 1918 that allowed detention without trial in August 1923. Subsequently, Muzaffar Ahmed (Calcutta), Shaukat Usmani (Kanpur) and Gulam Hussain (Lahore) were arrested. On 20 December 1923 Nalini Gupta was also arrested under the same regulation. Roy evaded arrest since he was abroad. Ramcharan Lal Sharma was not arrested because he had migrated to the French territory of Pondicherry due to police harassment.\n\nOn 17 March 1924 cases were framed against the accused in what was called the Cawnpore (now spelt Kanpur) Bolshevik Conspiracy case. The specific charge was that they as communists were seeking \"to deprive the King Emperor of his sovereignty of British India, by complete separation of India from imperialistic Britain by a violent revolution.\" Out of the six accused in custody only four—S. A. Dange, Shaukat Usmani, Muzaffar Ahmed and Nalini Gupta—were produced. Singaravelar, now 64, was confined to bed due to illness. He was later released on bail. Gulam Hussain was pardoned after he confessed that he had received money in Kabul.\n\nThe case attracted interest of the people towards Comintern plan to bring about violent revolution in India. Communist trials had taken place in India, in frontier towns like Peshawar where Russian trained muhajir communists were put on trial. \"But no case had attracted public gaze like the Kanpur case. Pages of newspapers daily splashed sensational communist plans and people for the first time learned such a large scale about communism and its doctrines and the aims of the Communist International in India.\" Names of accused like S.A. Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani and Singaravelu Chettiar came to be recognised across the country.\n\nIn 1924, shortly after the Kanpur Conspiracy Case, Satyabhakta, a Congress worker in the United Provinces had decided to organise a 'legal' Communist Party, that is, a party that would not attract treasonable charges such as in the Kanpur case. Initially no significant notice was taken of Satyabhakta's venture, but when Nalini Gupta was released from the jail (July 1925) and later when Muzaffar Ahmed was released in September on grounds of poor health, their interest fell on Satyabhakta's party for organizational work—in the absence of any other structure. Satyabhakta then announced a communist conference in DeMarxistcember 1925, at Kanpur, to be concurrently held with Indian National Congress convention. His idea was to demarcate himself from the existing communist groups. N. N. Roy was skeptical when he wrote in the October 1925 issue of his magazine,\"Masses of India\" that It is premature to say that what shape this 'Communist Party' will ultimately assume and how far it is going to be Communist in Programme and actions.\n\nThe conference was held on 25–26 December 1925. Singaravelu Chettiar was elected to preside over the session. The meeting adopted a resolution for the formation of the Communist Party of India. Accoriding to the Constitution, the object of the Party was, to quote, establishment of workers' and peasants' republic based on socialisation of means of production and distribution, by the liberation of India from British imperialist domination. The British Government's extreme hostility towards communists, made them to decide not to openly function as a communist party; instead, they chose a more open and non-federated platform, under the name the Workers and Peasants Parties.\n\nEmployees of various railway systems in India, the North-Western Railway, Bengal Nagpur Railway, and The East Indian Railway went on to strike demanding better working conditions and for better treatment by the management.Singaravelar went on a tour to north India to extend his support to the striking railway employees. In February 1927 he reached Bhopal and met the striking workers. In Howrah and Bengal 30,000 workers were on strike. Singaravelar along with a group of workers from Madras State also took part in the strike.\n\nAfter returning from his North Indian tour Singaravelar was drawn into another railway employees' strike. In 1927, the workers of the South Indian Railways were resisting measures by the management to retrench them through a fresh assessment of their skills. Also the management had decided relocating employees working in different railway workshops to one near Tiruchirapalli(Trichy). The workers demanded the withdrawal of both these measures. When the management refused to accede to their demands, the workers went on strike from 19 July 1928. All the railway employees, irrespective of their seniority, joined the strike. from 21 July 1928 the trains were stilled.\n\nThe strike eventually failed. Singaravelar along with a prominent leader of the strike, Sakkarai Chettiar, and a number of employees were arrested.Singaravelar was sentenced the ten years imprisonment, which was reduced to 18 months on appeal.\n\nSingaravelar felt that E.V. Ramasami Naicker's self-respect movement (that advocated for upliftment of low castes and opposing upper castes) and the communist movement should work together to save the Tamil labour forces from the clutches of both religious and economic exploiters. This appealed to Naicker and he published Singaravelar's contributions in his magazine,\"Kudiyarasu\". In 1931, Naicker undertook a journey to Soviet Russia and other European countries. On his return, he invited Singaravelar to Erode for discussions. Naicker convened a meeting of the movement at his residence on 28–29 December 1932, and drew out what was called the Erode Plan. Naicker had taken a decision to support pro-British Justice Party and to oppose the Indian National Congress in the elections that followed. Unlike Congress, the Justice Party had agreed to implement a policy of appointments to government jobs in proportion to caste ratios, as demanded by the leaders of the self-respect movement.\n\nSignificance of Singaravelar's association with the self-respect movement is brought out by Karthigesu Sivathamby, a prominent Tamil scholar from Sri Lanka who has closely studied the social movements in Madras province,\n\nBy this time the rationalist movement, through its association with the world socialist movement, was becoming more scientific. It was not merely rationalism in the Ingersolian sense. It was becoming more and more scientific... promotion of socialism, and so on. And this is seen in the immediate tie-up of M. Singaravelu Chettiar and Periyar\n\n\n"}

{"id": "376692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=376692", "title": "Silbo Gomero", "text": "Silbo Gomero\n\nSilbo Gomero ( , 'Gomeran whistle'), also known as el silbo ('the whistle'), is a whistled register of Spanish used by inhabitants of La Gomera in the Canary Islands to communicate across the deep ravines and narrow valleys that radiate through the island. It enables messages to be exchanged over a distance of up to 5 kilometres. Due to this loud nature, Silbo Gomero is generally used in circumstances of public communication. Messages conveyed could range from event invitations to public information advisories.\nA speaker of Silbo Gomero is sometimes referred to in Spanish as a \"silbador\" ('whistler'). Silbo Gomero is a transposition of Spanish from speech to whistling. This oral phoneme-whistled phoneme substitution emulates Spanish phonology through a reduced set of whistled phonemes. It was declared as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2009.\n\nLittle is known of the original Guanche language or the languages of the Canaries, but it is assumed that their phonological system must have been simple enough to allow an efficient whistled language. Used by the island's original inhabitants, the Guanches, the whistled language existed before the arrival of Spanish settlers and was also spoken on el Hierro, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria. Silbo was adapted to Spanish during the Spanish settlement in the 16th century and was widely spoken throughout the period into the following 17th century. In 1976 Silbo barely remained on el Hierro, where it had flourished at the end of the 19th century.\n\nUse of the language declined in the 1950s, one factor being the economic decline, which forced many speakers to move away to seek better jobs to cope financially. Technological developments such as the telephone played a part in reducing the practicality and utility of the language. The language's earlier survival had been due to its role in overcoming distance and terrain, in addition to the ease with which it is learned by native speakers. Most significantly, in the period from the 1960s to 1980s, many people had turned away from agriculture and so many middle class families did not want their children to speak the language as it was negatively associated with the rural peasants.\n\nIn the late 1990s, language revitalization efforts began and initiatives from within the community started. By 1999, the revitalization of Silbo Gomero was furthered by education policies and other legislative measures. It now has official protection as an example of intangible cultural heritage.\n\nMany people in La Gomera speak Silbo Gomero, but their expression of the language deviates in minor ways which show the different origins of the speaker. As reported in a 2009 UNESCO report, all the people living in La Gomera understand the language, but only those born before 1950 and the younger generations who attended school since 1999 can speak the language. Those born before 1950 were taught the language by their elders in their homes, and those who have attended or are attending school since 1999 were taught the language formally in school. Those born between 1950 and 1980 understand the language but are unable to speak it, as the language was hardly used and negatively viewed during their time of language acquisition.\n\nWhen this medium of communication was endangered in the late 20th century, revitalization efforts were generated at both community level and governmental level. A combination of initiatives from the La Gomeran community and policies implemented by the authorities saw Silbo Gomero being revitalized and maintained as a cultural asset. These revitalization efforts were well-documented by UNESCO as part of the proceedings for the selection of the 2009 Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nIn a bid to preserve Silbo Gomero for the island’s youth, expert whistlers sought to obtain authorization, which enabled them to teach the language on a free and voluntary basis at a dedicated centre. This initiative by the senior islanders garnered encouraging responses, with parent-teacher associations extending it to all schools. The first of many revitalization measures was thus adopted at the grassroots level, not by public or private entities, which reflected the language attitude of locals towards Silbo Gomero. Education policies which were implemented later were inspired as such - revitalization began at the grassroots and escalated to the highest government bodies.\n\nOn 26 June 1997, the Parliament of the Canary Islands approved a motion calling on the government to include Silbo Gomero as part of school curriculum. Silbo Gomero then became a mandatory subject in primary and secondary education, as of July 1999. The provincial government was supportive in its implementation of education policy and also the establishment of a formalized Silbo Gomero curriculum through the publication of \"El Silbo Gomero, Materiales didácticos\" (Educational Materials on the Silbo Gomero).\n\nIn addition to the compulsory learning of Silbo Gomero at the primary and secondary level, an Island School of Silbo Gomero was established for post-secondary students who wish to continue to train in Silbo Gomero until they become accredited professional instructors. Students of the Island School work to become capable of teaching Silbo Gomero to not only their fellow citizens, but also tourists who visit La Gomera. This facilitates the sustainability of the revitalization and also works towards language maintenance.\n\nThereafter, the Ministry of Education, Universities, Culture and Sport of the Canary Islands developed a staff training plan in order to ensure that the elderly expert whistlers can be replaced in the near future by qualified professional teachers with relevant diplomas. This comprised training courses on proficiency in and teaching of Silbo Gomero. The training plan was launched in 2007, with the participation of 18 teachers.\n\nBesides the implementation of education policies, the authorities also sought to strengthen the corpus of Silbo Gomero by developing a project to digitize all recorded audio material. Local, national and worldwide distribution of documentaries on Silbo Gomero were also made. The government also raised the status of Silbo Gomero by selecting the whistled language of La Gomera via the National Historical Heritage Council to represent Spain in the nominations for inclusion on the 2009 Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nMembers of the Gomeran community treasure Silbo Gomero as part of the island’s identity and use the whistled language in traditional rituals and festivities on the island. One of these includes \"bajadas\", which are processions dedicated to the Virgin or the patron saints of the community. \nOn 15 March 1999, Silbo Gomero was declared as part of the historical ethnographic heritage of the Canary Islands. The annual celebration of “School Encounters with Silbo Gomero” was also inaugurated in La Gomera. In 2005, the monument to Silbo Gomero was inducted in Garajonay National Park.\n\n Silbo Gomero is not only used between Gomerans; visitors to the island have the opportunity to be exposed to the whistled language too, in restaurants which provide whistling demonstrations for tourists. Minister of Tourism of La Gomera, Fernando Mendez, asserted that whistling is essential to the tourism industry of La Gomera.\n\nAccording to different studies, the Silbo Gomero Language has between 2 and 4 vowels and between 4 and 10 consonants.\nThe language is a whistled form of a dialect of Spanish. Silbo replaces each vowel or consonant with a whistling sound. Whistles are distinguished according to pitch and continuity. As with other whistled forms of non-tonal languages, Silbo works by retaining approximately the articulation of ordinary speech, so \"the timbre variations of speech appear in the guise of pitch variations\" (Busnel and Classe: v).\n\nSilbo Gomero is a complex language to learn, with its whistling techniques requiring physical precision, and a strength of the body parts used in mechanism of the language, that can only be acquired with practice. Silbo Gomero uses the tongue, lips and hands of the users, differing greatly from conventional language, which uses the mouth cavity to blend and contrast several acoustic frequencies. The whistling mechanism, in contrast, is limited to only emitting a single basic pitch between 1,000 and 3,000 hertz.\nThe physical precision comes in the skill of the whistler being able to vary the frequencies at different speeds and to start and stop the production of the sound waves. \nThis technique is handed down within La Gomera’s community, with unchanged teaching methods that date back to the late nineteenth century.\nThe same pitch can represent many sounds, so it has much fewer phonemes than Spanish. This means that communication in Silbo can be ambiguous at times. Context and appropriate choice of words are thus important for effective communication.\n\nThe vowels of Silbo Gomero are described roughly as sustained lines of high and low frequency that are distinct from each other. \n\nThe high frequency /i/ vowel represents the vowels of the spoken language being whistled, while the low frequency whistle of the dark /a/ vowel represents the vowels . It is said that it is not possible to produce any vowels with intermediary frequencies as the whistling mechanism does not have the same functions that the vocal mechanism possess. \nThe theory that Silbo Gomero has only two vowels was theorised by Ramón Trujillo of the University of La Laguna in his published book \"EL SILBO GOMERO análisis lingüístico\" in 1978. His work, containing almost a hundred spectrograms, concludes in a theory that there are only two vowels and four consonants in the Silbo Gomero language. In Trujillo's work Silbo's vowels are given one quality, that of pitch, being either high or low. \nHowever, in a more recent study, the work of Julien Meyer (2005 - in French only (pg 100), 2008) gives a statistical analysis of the vowels of Silbo showing that there are 4 vowels statistically distinguished in production and that they are also perceived so. \nAlso in 2005, Annie Rialland of the published an acoustic and phonological analysis of Silbo based on new materials, showing that, not only gliding tones, but also intensity modulation plays a role in distinguishing different whistled sounds.\n\nTrujillo's 2005 collaboration with Gomeran whistler Isidro Ortiz and others (\"EL SILBO GOMERO Materiales didácticos\" - q.v. pdf link below) revises his earlier assertions to state that 4 vowels are indeed perceived (q.v. pg 63 ref. cit.), and describes in detail the areas of divergence between his empirical data and Classe’s phonetic hypotheses. Despite Trujillo's 2005 work acknowledging the existence of 4 vowels, his 2006 bilingual work (\"El Silbo Gomero. Nuevo estudio fonológico\") inexplicably reiterates his 1978 two-vowel theory. Trujillo's 2006 work directly addresses many of Rialland's conclusions, but it seems that at the time of that writing he was unaware of Meyer's work.\n\nMeyer suggests that there are 4 vowel classes of , , , . However Meyer goes on to say that there are 5 perceived vowels with significant overlap. \nRialland (2005) and Trujillo (1978) both agree that the harmonic of the whistle matches the second formant of the spoken vowels. Spoken 's F2 and whistled 's H1 match in their frequency (1480 Hz). However, there is a disconnect in harmonics and formants near the frequency basement. Spoken speech has a wide range of F2 frequencies (790 Hz to 2300 Hz), whistles are limited to between 1200 Hz and 2400 Hz. Vowels are therefore shifted upwards at the lower end (maintaining 1480 Hz as ) increasing confusion between (spoken F2 freq 890 Hz, whistled <1300 Hz) and (spoken freq 790 Hz, Whistled «1300 Hz). In whistling the frequency basement must be raised to the minimum whistle harmonic of 1000 Hz reducing frequency spacing in the vowels, which increases misidentification in the lower vowels.\n\nConsonants in Silbo Gomero are modifications of the vowel-based “melody line” or “vocal line”. They may be rising or falling or can also be modified by being broken, continuous or occlusive. The four main consonants in the now largely debunked and disproven 1978 analysis were wrongly listed as follows:\nThe documentation on the official Silbo Gomero page on the UNESCO website is in line with Trujillo’s 1978 study. Trujillo (1978) suggested that the consonants are either rises or dips in the \"melody line\" which can be broken or continuous.\nFurther investigation by Meyer and by Rialland suggest that vowels are stripped to their inherent class of sound which is communicated in the whistle in these ways: voice ( vs ) is transmitted by the whistled feature [-continuity]. A silent pause in the whistle communicates [+voice] (), while a [+continuous] consonant gives the quality [-voice] (). Placement of the consonant (dental, palatal, fricative) is transmitted in whistle by the loci, the sharpness or speed, of the formant transitions between vowels. Consonant classes are simplified into four classes. Extra high loci (near vertical formant loci) denotes affricates and stridents, rising loci denotes alveolar, medial (loci just above the vowel formant) denotes palatal, and falling (low loci) denotes pharyngeal, labial, and fricative. This gives 8 whistled consonants, but including tone gradual decay (with intensity falling off) as a feature on continuous and interrupted sounds gives 10 consonants. In these situations gradual decay is given [+voice], and continuous is given [+liquid].\n\nThe representation of /s/ is actually treated as a broken high pitch when whistled in Silbo. However, in the spoken language, /s/ is a continuous high pitch consonant. There are two reasons for this anomaly. Firstly, in functional terms, the /s/ consonant is high in frequency, thus being extremely useful. Secondly, as the continuous high-pitched consonant of Silbo already represents many other consonants of the spoken language (/l/, /ʎ/, /n/, /ɲ/, /ɾ/, /r/, /d/ and /ʝ/), it would be very confusing to add on to the extensive list. Thus, as the broken high-pitched consonant does not fully represent /t͡ʃ/ and /t/, it can be used to represent the frequently used /s/ consonant.\n\nStudies have shown that Silbo Gomero speakers process the whistled register in the same way as the standard spoken language. Studies carried out by Manuel Carreiras of the University of La Laguna and David Corina of the University of Washington published research on Silbo in 2004 and 2005. Their study involved two participant groups of Spanish speakers. One group of Spanish speakers “spoke” Silbo, while the other group did not. Results obtained from monitoring the participants' brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging have shown that while non-speakers of Silbo merely processed Silbo as whistling, speakers of Silbo processed the whistling sounds in the same linguistic centers of the brain that processed Spanish sentences.\n\nFilm maker and photographer Francesca Phillips wrote and directed a documentary on the usage of Silbo Gomero in La Gomera titled “Written in the Wind” (2009) and this 26min film won Best Short Documentary in Anthropology at The World Mountain Documentary Festival held in Qinghai, China in 2010.\n\nFrench singer Féloche dedicated a song to this traditional singing called Silbo.\n\nThere are other examples of transposition of an oral natural language into a pitch string. When quickly spoken, Yoruba vowels are assimilated and consonants elided, so the linguistic information is carried by the tone system, which can therefore be transposed into talking drums.\n\n"}

The reasons for this transformation vary in different parts of the world, but some concerns are common to most Telecom Service Providers. Drivers for transformation include threats such as competitive pressures and the disruptive business models of players in other technologies affect the traditional business of the service providers. (\"E.g. As this page is written, the traditional voice-service business of PSTN Service Providers are facing threats from the disruptive business models of Internet based service providers such as Google and Skype when they already were battling to fend off new competitors such as Multi-Service operators.\")\n\nIn order to maintain their market, the service providers are introducing new attractive services to the end-users, which require modifications to their current infrastructure (aka \"legacy\" infrastructure) into what is typically termed as a \"Next-Generation\" infrastructure. The process of converting or modifying the network elements, end-user services and business-processes of the service provider to achieve the competitive advantages offered by the newer technologies is known as \"Transformation\". This transformation is enabled by Internet Protocol (IP)-based technology. The introduction of the new infrastructure, services and business-processes may or may not be accompanied by the dismantling of the legacy setup.\n\nIn cases where service providers are looking to reduce operating expenses in addition to creating new end-user services, elimination of the legacy network becomes a requirement. In these transformation scenarios, carriers replace aging legacy network elements and systems in favor of more efficient technologies. These types of transformation programs may require carriers to transition subscribers and commercial services from the legacy to the new networks.\n\nThe telecom transformation process is a combination of the following three sub-processes.\n\nWhile these are the three main categories of network and systems change within the carrier environment, there are additional fundamental changes that service providers will undertake to adapt their business and organization to a new operating model.\n\nThe Network Transformation sub-process refers to the activities adding new elements in the Core Network, Backbone network and Access network. The typical activities include the following:\n\nThis sub-process is aimed at ensuring that the services offered in the legacy network and availed by the end-users continue to be available during the transition phase and up to a planned future. This sub-process is also concerned with introduction of new end-user services into the next-generation network. Typical activities include:\n\nThis refers to the sub-process that is involved in aligning the Operations Support System and Business Support System infrastructure with the transformed network.

It is sometimes referred to as \"Chiuchow\", its Cantonese name, due to the strong influence of that language over the traditionally Teochew-speaking areas. It is closely related to Hokkien, as it shares some cognates and have a highly similar phonology with it though limited mutual intelligibility exists in terms of pronunciation and vocabulary between them.\n\nTeochew preserves many Old Chinese pronunciations and vocabulary that have been lost in some of the other modern varieties of Chinese. As such, many linguists consider Teochew one of the most conservative Chinese dialects.\n\nTeochew is a variety the Southern Min, which in turn constitutes a part of Min Chinese, one of the seven major language groups of Chinese. As with other varieties of Chinese, it is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin, Cantonese, Shanghainese and other Chinese varieties. However, it has limited intelligibility with the Hokkien dialects, such as those of Amoy, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Taiwanese. Even within the Teochew dialects, there is substantial variation in phonology between different regions of Chaoshan and between different Teochew communities overseas.\n\nThe Chaoshan dialects in China be roughly divided into three sub-groups defined by physically proximate areas:\n\n\nThe Chaoshan region, which includes the twin cities of Chaozhou and Shantou, is where the standard variant of Teochew (Chaoshan dialact) is spoken. Parts of the Hakka-speaking regions of Jiexi County, Dabu County and Fengshun, also contain pocket communities of Teochew speakers.\n\nAs Chaoshan was one of the major sources of Chinese emigration to Southeast Asia during the 18th to 20th centuries, a considerable Overseas Chinese community in that region is Teochew-speaking. In particular, the Teochew people settled in significant numbers in Cambodia, Thailand and Laos, where they form the largest Chinese sub-language group. Teochew-speakers form a minority among Chinese communities in Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia (especially in the states of Johor and Selangor) and Indonesia (especially in West Kalimantan on Borneo). Waves of migration from Chaoshan to Hong Kong, especially after the communist victory of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, has also resulted in the formation of a community there, although most descendants now primarily speak Cantonese and English.\n\nTeochew speakers are also found among overseas Chinese communities in Japan and the Western world (notably in the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France and Italy), a result of both direct emigration from Chaoshan to these nations and secondary emigration from Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Singapore, Teochew remains the ancestral language of many Chinese Singaporeans, with the Teochews making up second largest Chinese group in Singapore, after the Hokkiens. Despite this many Teochew, particularly the younger generations are shifting towards English and Mandarin as their main spoken language. This is due to the Singapore government's stringent bilingual policy that promotes English as the official language of education, government and commerce and promotes Mandarin at the expense of other Chinese varieties. Some Teochews assimilated with the larger Hokkien community and speak Hokkien rather than Teochew due to Hokkien's prominent role as a lingua franca previously among the Singaporean Chinese community and the similarities between the two varieties. \n\nIn Thailand, particularly in the Bangkok, Teochew is still spoken among older ethnic Chinese Thai citizens; however, the younger generation tends to learn Standard Mandarin and/or Standard Cantonese as a second or third language after Thai and English.\n\nTeochew was never widely spoken among Chinese communities in Japan and South Korea, since most of the Teochew people who migrated to these countries are secondary immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Most of them are second-generation people from Hong Kong and Taiwan who speak Cantonese, Hokkien and Mandarin, as well as Korean and Japanese, leaving Teochew to be spoken mostly by elders.\n\nTeochew is a variety of Southern Min and is one of the more well known Min Chinese varieties, together with Hokkien, which is spoken in southern Fujian, and the and Fuzhou dialect, a dialect of Eastern Min, spoken in Fujian's capital, Fuzhou. It has high phonetic similarity to Hokkien but has low lexical similarity. Although Teochew shares some cognates with Hokkien, there are pronounced differences in most vowels with some consonant and tone shifts. Some of its vocabulary and phrases are distinct from Hokkien.\n\nMost Teochew do not speak Hokkien and the majority see themselves as a distinct group, but due to their similarity most can understand Hokkien to a degree and may treat it as a variation of their own tongue. There are a minority of Teochew who speak Hokkien as their mother tongue, most of whom have close contact or relatives in neighbouring southern Fujian. These Hokkien speaking Teochew people are more likely to treat Teochew simply as accented form of Hokkien. These people usually have a strong sense of Hokkien identity and due to cultural similarities, easily integrate into Hokkien culture. \n\nThis refers to Chaozhou, the variant of Southern Min (Min Nan) spoken in China.\n\nChaozhou children are introduced to Standard Chinese as early as in kindergarten; however, Chaozhou remains the primary medium of instruction. In the early years of primary education, Mandarin becomes the sole language of instruction, although students typically continue to talk to one another in Chaozhou. Mandarin is widely understood, however minimally, by most younger Chaozhou speakers, but the elderly usually do not speak Mandarin since teaching was done in the local vernacular in the past.\n\nNative Chaozhou speakers find the neutral tone in Mandarin hardest to master. Chaozhou has lost the alveolar nasal ending and so the people often replace the sound in Mandarin with the velar nasal . None of the southern Min dialects have a front rounded vowel, therefore a typical Chaozhou accent supplants the unrounded counterpart for . Chaozhou, like its ancient ancestor, lacks labio-dentals; people therefore substitute or for when they speak Mandarin. Chaozhou does not have any of the retroflex consonants in the northern dialects, so they pronounce , , , and instead of , , and .\n\nSince Chao'an, Raoping and Jieyang border the Hakka-speaking region in the north, some people in these regions speak Hakka, though they can usually speak Chaozhou as well. Chaozhou people have historically had a great deal of contact with the Hakka people, but Hakka has had little, if any, influence on Chaozhou. Similarly, in Dabu and Fengshun, where the Chaozhou- and Hakka-speaking regions meet, Chaozhou is also spoken although Hakka remains the primary form of Chinese spoken there.\n\nBecause of the strong influence of Hong Kong soap operas, Guangdong provincial television programs and Cantonese pop songs, many young Chaoshan peoples can understand quite a lot of Cantonese even if they cannot speak it in certain degrees of fluency.\n\nIn the mountainous area of Fenghuang (), the She language, an endangered Hmong–Mien language, is spoken by the She people, who are an officially recognised non-Han ethnic minority. They predominantly speak Hakka and Teochew; only about 1,000 She still speak their eponymous language.\n\nTeochew, like other Southern Min varieties, is one of the few modern Sinitic languages which have voiced obstruents (stops, fricatives and affricates); however, unlike Wu and Xiang Chinese, the Teochew voiced stops and fricatives did not evolve from Middle Chinese voiced obstruents, but from nasals. The voiced stops and and also are voicelessly prenasalised , , , respectively. They are in complementary distribution with the tenuis stops , occurring before nasal vowels and nasal codas, whereas the tenuis stops occur before oral vowels and stop codas. The voiced affricate , initial in such words as 字 (dzi˩), 二 (dzi˧˥), 然 (dziaŋ˥), 若 (dziak˦) loses its affricate property with some younger speakers abroad, and is relaxed to [z].\n\nSouthern Min dialects and varieties are typified by a lack of labiodentals, as illustrated below:\n\nSyllables in Teochew contain an onset consonant, a medial glide, a nucleus, usually in the form of a vowel, but can also be occupied by a syllabic consonant like [ŋ], and a final consonant. All the elements of the syllable except for the nucleus are optional, which means a vowel or a syllabic consonant alone can stand as a fully-fledged syllable.\n\nAll the consonants except for the glottal stop ʔ shown in the consonants chart above can act as the onset of a syllable; however, the onset position is not obligatorily occupied.\n\nTeochew finals consist maximally of a medial, nucleus and coda. The medial can be i or u, the nucleus can be a monophthong or diphthong, and the coda can be a nasal or a stop. A syllable must consist minimally of a vowel nucleus or syllabic nasal.\n\nTeochew, like other Chinese varieties, is a tonal language. It has six tones (reduced to two in stopped syllables) and extensive tone sandhi.\nAs with sandhi in other Min Nan dialects, the checked tones interchange. The \"yang\" tones all become low. Sandhi is not accounted for in the description below.\n\nThe grammar of Teochew is similar to other Min languages, as well as some southern varieties of Chinese, especially with Hakka, Yue and Wu. The sequence 'subject–verb–object' is typical, like Standard Mandarin, although the 'subject–object–verb' form is also possible using particles.\n\nThe personal pronouns in Teochew, like in other Chinese varieties, do not show case marking, therefore means both \"I\" and \"me\" and means \"they\" and \"them\". The southern Min dialects, like some northern dialects, have a distinction between an inclusive and exclusive we, meaning that when the addressee is being included, the inclusive pronoun would be used, otherwise . No other southern Chinese variety has this distinction.\n\nTeochew does not distinguish the possessive pronouns from the possessive adjectives. As a general rule, the possessive pronouns or adjectives are formed by adding the genitive or possessive marker [kai5] to their respective personal pronouns, as summarised below:\n\nAs is the generic measure word, it may be replaced by other more appropriate classifiers:\n\nTeochew has the typical two-way distinction between the demonstratives, namely the proximals and the distals, as summarised in the following chart:\n\nNote: (T): Traditional characters; (S): Simplified characters.\n\nOrdinal numbers are formed by adding in front of a cardinal number.\n\nIn Teochew passive construction, the agent phrase \"by somebody\" always has to be present, and is introduced by either (some speakers use or instead) or , even though it is in fact a zero or indefinite agent as in:\n\nWhile in Mandarin one can have the agent introducer or alone without the agent itself, it is not grammatical to say\n\nInstead, we have to say:\n\nEven though this is unknown.\n\nNote also that the agent phrase always comes immediately after the subject, not at the end of the sentence or between the auxiliary and the past participle like in some European languages (e.g. German, Dutch)\n\nTeochew uses the construction \"X ADJ Y\", which is believed to have evolved from the Old Chinese \"X ADJ (yú) Y\" structure to express the idea of comparison:\n\nCantonese uses the same construction:\n\nHowever, due to modern influences from Mandarin, the Mandarin structure \"X Y ADJ\" has also gained popularity over the years. Therefore, the same sentence can be re-structured and becomes:\n\nIt must be noted that the - or -construction must involve two or more nouns to be compared; an ill-formed sentence will be yielded when only one is being mentioned:\n\nTeochew is different from English, where the second noun being compared can be left out (\"Tatyana is more beautiful \"(than Lisa)\"\". In cases like this, the -construction must be used instead:\n\nThe same holds true for Mandarin and Cantonese in that another structure needs to be used when only one of the nouns being compared is mentioned. Note also that Teochew and Mandarin both use a pre-modifier (before the adjective) while Cantonese uses a post-modifier (after the adjective).\n\nThere are two words which are intrinsically comparative in meaning, i.e. [ĩã5] \"better\" and [su1] \"worse\". They can be used alone or in conjunction with the -structure:\n\nNote the use of the adverbial [hoʔ2 tsoi7] at the end of the sentence to express a higher degree.\n\nIn Teochew, the idea of equality is expressed with the word [pẽ5] or [pẽ5 ĩõ7]:\n\nTo express the superlative, Teochew uses the adverb [siaŋ5] or [siaŋ5 teŋ2]. However, it should be noted that is usually used with a complimentary connotation.\n\nThe vocabulary of Teochew shares a lot of similarities with Cantonese because of their continuous contact with each other. Like Cantonese, Teochew has a great deal of monosyllabic words. However, ever since the standardisation of Modern Standard Chinese, Teochew has absorbed a lot of Putonghua vocabulary, which is predominantly polysyllabic. Also, Teochew varieties in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have also borrowed extensively from Malay.\n\nTeochew and other Southern Min varieties, such as Hokkien, preserve a good deal of Old Chinese vocabulary, such as [mak] \"eye\" (, Hokkien: 目 \"ba̍k\"), [ta] \"dry\" (, Hokkien: 焦 \"ta\"), and [kʰəŋ] \"hide\" (cf. ; Hokkien: 囥 \"khǹg\").\n\nTeochew was romanised by the Provincial Education Department of Guangdong in 1960 to aid linguistic studies and the publication of dictionaries, although Pe̍h-ōe-jī can also be used because Christian missionaries invented it for the transcription of varieties of Southern Min.\n\nInitial consonants of Teochew, are represented in the Guangdong Romanization system as: B, BH, C, D, G, GH, H, K, L, M, N, NG, P, R, S, T, and Z.\n\n\"Examples\":\n\nVowels and vowel combinations in the Teochew dialect include: A, E, Ê, I, O, U, AI, AO, IA, IAO, IO, IU, OI, OU, UA, UAI, UE, and UI.\n\n\"Examples:\"\n\nMany words in Teochew are nasalized. This is represented by the letter \"n\" in the Guangdong Pengim system.\n\n\"Example (nasalized)\":\n\nEnding consonants in Teochew include M and NG as well as the stops discussed below.\n\n\"Examples\":\n\nTeochew retains many consonant stops lost in Mandarin. These stops include a labial stop: \"b\"; velar stop: \"g\"; and glottal stop: \"h\".\n\n\"Examples:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24822227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24822227", "title": "Venezuelan Sign Language", "text": "Venezuelan Sign Language\n\nVenezuelan Sign language or VSL (\"Lengua de señas venezolana\" or \"LSV\") is the national deaf sign language of Venezuela. The term, \"Venezuelan Sign Language,\" began to be used in the 1930s. It is widely used, and Venezuela has a national bilingual education program for VSL and Spanish, though the language used by adults differs from that of the classroom. There is a large VSL dictionary published by the \"Federación Venezolana de Sordos\". VSL has been used in schools since 1937.\n\nThe first known references to a Deaf community which used a sign language in Venezuela date from the 1930s. In 1935 the first school for children with hearing difficulties, the \"Instituto Venezolano de Ciegos y Sordomudos\" (Venezuelan Blind and Deaf Institute), was founded in Caracas. That school served as the cradle for a small community of signers, who created a sign language out of many signs which the children had used at home. A few years later the administration of the institute decided to separate the instruction of blind and deaf students and created the \"Escuela Taller de Sordomudos\" (Workshop School for the Prelingually Deaf). This school hired hearing teachers trained in Spain, who knew Spanish Sign language. The mingling of the system developed by the students and the language used by the teachers seems to be the origin of what is today VSL. \n\nIn 1950, the first generation of alumni of the schools founded the \"Asociación de Sordomudos de Caracas\" (Deaf Association of Caracas), under the direction of José Arquero Urbano, an immigrant who had been a leader of the Deaf community in Madrid. The influence of the signs brought by Arquero further transformed VSL, according to recollections collected from people involved in that period of the Association. Because of this many Venezuelan Deaf people assume that Arquero was the creator of VSL.\n\nIn 1999 after intensive lobbying by the Deaf associations of Venezuela, the constituent assembly included two references to LSV in the current constitution of Venezuela. Article 81 recognizes the right of Deaf people to communicate through LSV and Article 101 establishes that Deaf people have the right to be informed in their language through public and private television.\n\nLSV, nevertheless, retains a lower legal status than the language officially recognized by the constitution. Article 9 grants the status of an \"official language\" to Spanish (throughout the nation) and to native languages (in the ancestral territories). LSV does not receive such recognition. The constitution only recognizes the right to use LSV.\n\nStudies on LSV indicate that the language has the same structural elements described in other sign languages, such as, the use of directional signs, the use of signs with classifiers, changes in the form of the sign to indicate mood and aspect, and a strong pragmatical dependence in defining argument roles. In addition, as a result of studies on the grammar of LSV, there has also been research into the psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and ethnolinguistics of the Deaf community in the country.\n\nIncluded among the users of LSV are both the Deaf who use the language as their principal means of communication and hearing people who have a range of fluency in LSV.\n\nThe number of users is unknown. There are 1.2 million deaf in Venezuela, but most lost their hearing late in life. There were over 3000 deaf children in the national public school system in 2004, and around 9000 members of Deaf associations; with around 0.2% of children typically born deaf, there are an estimated congenitally 15,000 deaf people in Venezuela. However, it is not known how many of them speak VSL.\n\n"}
