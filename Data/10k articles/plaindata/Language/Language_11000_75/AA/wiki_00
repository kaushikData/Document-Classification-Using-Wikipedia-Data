The advertisement, called \"Patria\" and awarded with a Silver Lion at the Cannes Lions festival, criticizes Spanish double standard and ends with the phrase \"We live in a disgustingly hypocritical country, but some of us do not give up\".\n\nIn 2017, she starred in her first feature film called \"Contigo no, bicho\" directed by Álvaro Alonso and Miguel Ángel Jiménez, which premiered at the Málaga Film Festival.\n\nSince March 2018 she has a Patreon page, a crowdfunding site that allows her to subsidize her videos and activities, rewarding her followers with exclusive advantages.\n\nAlthough she has not said a definite goodbye to pornography, she has stopped shooting voluntarily since the beginning of 2017 because it is no longer a challenge and she wants to live new experiences. She is aware of the difficulty of this new path due to the stigma she suffers from having devoted herself to sex work, according to her own words \"I will always be the porn actress who...\".\n\nShe has taken part, among others, on the television programs \"Al rincón de pensar\" (Antena 3), \"Late Motiv\" (Movistar+), \"Sálvame Deluxe\" (Telecinco), and \"The Zoo\" (LATV), while also taking part on the independent radio program \"Carne Cruda\".\n\nShe presents the television show \"Diario Vice\" on channel 0 of Movistar+ where she interviewed the Spanish artist Abel Azcona and the musical band Las Odio. In 2016 she was interviwed by Buenafuente in \"Late Motiv\". In 2018 she assisted to the TV program \"La Resistencia\", presented by David Broncano.\n\nShe appeared in the cover magazine \"Interviú\" in 2014 and 2016, as well as \"Bad Skin\", \"Mongolia\" and \"Primera Línea\".\n\nIn digital media, she has done many interviews such as \"Erebus\", \"Jot Down\" and \"GQ\". She is also very active in social media.\nShe uses her Youtube channel to express ideas about sustainability, stigma rupture and ecology. In this channel tells experiences like living a month in her van or without producing trash.\n\nIn 2015, she published her first book entitled \"Manual de psiconáutica\" with the publisher Lapsus Calami (while the prologue was done by Nacho Vigalondo and the epilogue by Luna Miguel) and it was a mix of poetry and photography. She defined it as \"my personal labyrinth, my nook, my innermost\".\n\nShe also wrote the prologue of \"@Alicia_hot\" written by Alejandro Ruiz Morillas, the back cover of the book \"Post Coño\" written by Gaby Bess (both in 2015) and the prologue of \"X\" written by Risto Mejide in 2016.\n\nIn May 2016, she held a talk with the deputies of Podemos Beatriz Gimeno and Clara Serra titled \"Sex, porn and feminism\" in which she said that pornography can not be used for sex education, but her presence in this talk was not well received by some feminist sectors. She held a talk again with Clara Serra in 2017, this time accompanied by the pornographic actor Aday Traun, at the Charles III University of Madrid titled \"Pornography and diversity\" in which she criticized some clichés of the pornographic industry.\n\nShe has appeared in short films \"The Immaculate Heart\" by Vex Ashley and \"Lacrimarum\" by Nico Bertrand. On the cover of the magazine \"Mongolia\" in March 2016, she posed emulating the Virgin Mary.\n\n\n"}

His television roles include Danny Tanner on the ABC sitcom \"Full House\" (1987–95) and its Netflix sequel \"Fuller House\", and hosting \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" from 1989 to 1997. Saget is also known for his adult-oriented stand-up routine. He also provided the voice of the future Ted Mosby on the CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\" from 2005 to 2014.\n\nSaget's 2014 comedy album, \"That's What I'm Talkin' About\", was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.\n\nSaget was born in Philadelphia to a Jewish family. His father, Benjamin (August 28, 1917 – January 30, 2007), was a supermarket executive, and his mother, Rosalyn \"Dolly\" (February 12, 1925 – February 15, 2014), was a hospital administrator. Saget lived in California before moving back to Philadelphia and graduating from high school. Saget originally intended to become a doctor, but his Honors English teacher, Elaine Zimmerman, saw his creative potential and urged him to seek a career in films.\n\nSaget attended Temple University's film school, where he created \"Through Adam's Eyes\", a black-and-white film about a boy who received reconstructive facial surgery and was honored with an award of merit in the Student Academy Awards. He graduated with a B.A. in 1978. Saget intended to take graduate courses at the University of Southern California but quit a few days later. Saget describes himself at the time in an article by Glenn Esterly in the 1990 \"Saturday Evening Post\": \"I was a cocky, overweight twenty-two-year-old. Then I had a gangrenous appendix taken out, almost died, and I got over being cocky or overweight.\" Saget talked about his burst appendix on \"Anytime with Bob Kushell\", saying that it happened on the Fourth of July, at the UCLA Medical Center and that they at first just iced the area for seven hours before taking it out and finding that it had become gangrenous.\n\nFollowing a short stint as a member of CBS' \"The Morning Program\" in early 1987, Saget was cast as Danny Tanner in \"Full House\", which became a success with family viewers, and landed in the Nielsen ratings' Top 30 beginning with season three. In 1989, Saget began as the host of \"America's Funniest Home Videos\", a role he held until 1997. During the early 1990s, Saget worked both on \"Full House\" and \"AFV\" simultaneously. In 2009, he returned to \"AFV\" for the 20th-anniversary one-hour special co-hosted with Tom Bergeron.\n\nSaget directed the 1996 ABC television movie \"For Hope\", which was inspired by the life story of his sister, Gay Saget, who died from scleroderma three years earlier.\n\nIn 1998, Saget directed his first feature film, \"Dirty Work\", starring Norm Macdonald and Artie Lange. Released one year after he left his long-running role as host of \"America's Funniest Home Videos\", the film received broadly negative reviews from critics and earned low box office returns. However, it has since become a cult favorite, due partially to Artie Lange's later popularity on \"The Howard Stern Show\" where the film is sometimes mentioned, often in unflattering terms.\n\nIn 1998, Saget made a cameo appearance as a cocaine addict in the stoner comedy \"Half Baked\".\n\nSaget had a sitcom on The WB titled \"Raising Dad\". It co-starred Kat Dennings, Brie Larson, and Jerry Adler and lasted only one season.\n\nSaget was host of NBC's game show \"1 vs. 100\" from 2006 to 2008.\n\nSaget served as the voice of the future Ted Mosby, who narrated the CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\", which premiered on September 19, 2005.\n\nHis HBO comedy special, \"That Ain't Right\", came out on DVD on August 28, 2007. It is dedicated to his father, Ben Saget, who died at age 89 on January 30, 2007, due to complications from congestive heart failure.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, Saget had a recurring role in four episodes of the HBO TV series \"Entourage\" playing a parody of himself. He would later appear in the 2015 feature film based on the series.\nSaget wrote, directed, and starred in \"Farce of the Penguins\", a parody of 2005's \"March of the Penguins\", which was released direct-to-DVD, in January 2007.\n\nSaget appeared in the Broadway musical \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" for a limited four-month engagement. He played \"Man in Chair\" while Jonathan Crombie, who normally played the character on Broadway, was with the national tour of the musical. On January 4, 2008, Saget's caricature was unveiled at Sardi's Restaurant.\n\nIn April 2009, he debuted in a new sitcom along with his co-star Cynthia Stevenson on ABC called \"Surviving Suburbia\". The series, which was originally to air on The CW, ended after one abbreviated season.\n\nIn 2010, Saget starred in an A&E series \"Strange Days\" in which he follows others in different activities and lifestyles, documenting their adventures in unusual ways.\n\nIn 2014, his book \"Dirty Daddy\" was released, in which Saget writes about his career, comedy influences, and experiences with life and death. He embarked on a small tour in support of the book, including the Pemberton Music Festival, where he introduced Snoop Dogg prior to performing his own set. In the same year, he toured Australia for the first time, with a stand-up show called \"Bob Saget Live: The Dirty Daddy Tour\". The show was performed in the major cities of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, he guest-starred in two episodes of \"Grandfathered\", starring and produced by his \"Full House\" co-star, John Stamos.\n\nSaget is currently a board member of the Scleroderma Research Foundation. His scleroderma efforts have further benefited such celebrities as \"Scary Movie\" star Regina Hall.\n\nIn an interview with \"Ability Magazine\", Saget discussed how his sister was diagnosed with scleroderma at 43 and died at 47. Before that, she had been misdiagnosed many times. \n\n"}

{"id": "48033014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48033014", "title": "Chichewa tones", "text": "Chichewa tones\n\nChichewa (a Bantu language of Central Africa, also known as Chewa, Nyanja, or Chinyanja) is the main language spoken in south and central Malawi, and to a lesser extent in Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Like most other Bantu languages, it is tonal; that is to say, pitch patterns are an important part of the pronunciation of words. Thus, for example, the word \"chímanga\" (high-low-low) \"maize\" can easily be distinguished from \"chinangwá\" (low-low-high) \"cassava\" not only by its consonants but also by its pitch pattern.\n\nTones (the rises and falls in pitch) also play an important grammatical role in Chichewa verbs, helping to distinguish one tense from another. They also play a part in intonation and phrasing and in distinguishing statements from questions.\n\nMost nouns have either one high tone (usually on one of the last three syllables) or none, although a few nouns (mostly compounds) have two tones. Verbs also usually have no more than one tone per morpheme. Chichewa thus in some respects can be considered to be a pitch-accent language with a \"mixture of accentual and tonal properties\".\n\nSome specialists, notably Larry Hyman, however, have argued that the term \"pitch-accent language\" is an over-simplification and should be avoided. He considers it best to consider such languages simply as one variety of tonal languages.\n\nCertain syllables in Chichewa words are associated with high pitch. Usually there is one high pitch per word or morpheme, but some words have no high tone. In nouns the high pitch is usually in one of the last three syllables:\n\nIn a few nouns (often compound words) there are two high tones. If these tones are separated by only one unaccented syllable, they usually join in a plateau of three high-toned syllables; that is, HLH becomes HHH:\n\nIn addition there are a large number of nouns which have no high tone, but which, even when focussed or emphasised, are pronounced with all the syllables low (as in the word \"station\" in the English phrase \"police station\"):\n\nBecause there is usually only one high tone per morpheme, it can be considered as a kind of tonal accent (see Pitch-accent language). It differs from a stress-accent such as in English in that it always retains the same pitch contour (e.g. high-low, never low-high). It is also possible for an accent to contrast with a lack of accent:\n\nVerbal roots too can have a lexical tone, but only on the final vowel \"-a\" of the verb. Most verbs, however, are toneless:\n\nThe tones are not inherited from proto-Bantu, but appear to be an independent development in Chichewa.\n\nMonosyllabic verbs are always toneless:\n\nOften a verb has a tone not because the root has one but because a stative or intensive suffix is added to it:\n\nOne of the main features of the Chichewa verb system is that each tense is associated with one of about eight different tonal patterns; there are different patterns again when the verb is in a relative clause or is negative. Thus the present simple (near future) is accented on the initial syllable, the remote perfect on the tense-marker \"-na-\", the present continuous on the syllable following the tense-marker \"-ku-\", the present habitual on the initial and penultimate, the remote imperfect on the tense-marker \"-ká-\" and the penultimate, the subjunctive on the final, the perfect is toneless, and so on:\n\nThese tonal patterns apply (with minor modifications) whether the verb is long or short. In some dialects it is common in longer verbs to hear tonal spreading, so that for example the first verb above is heard as \"ndífótokoza\" and the second as \"ndináfótokoza\". However, in the present habitual, the first tone does not spread. Tones will also spread, even in shorter verbs, when a verb is followed by an object, except for the subjunctive \"-é\".\n\nNegative verbs have different tonal patterns. For example, the negative infinitive, negative subjunctive, negative \"not yet\" tense, and negative future all have a single tone on the penultimate syllable. This tone causes all the other tones, such as the tone of the negative-marker \"sí\", to be omitted:\n\n\nWhen used in a relative clause, several tenses have a different intonation. Usually there is an extra accent on the first syllable, and often another on the penultimate:\n\nWhen the verb-root itself has a tone, this can be heard on the final vowel. However, if the tense has a penultimate or final accent, the tone cannot be heard:\n\nLexical and grammatical tones are not the only tones heard in a Chichewa sentence, but there are intonational tones as well. One common tone is a boundary tone rising from low to high which is heard whenever there is a pause in the sentence, for example after a topic or subordinate clause.\n\nTones are also added to questions. For example, the toneless word \"kuti\" 'where?' becomes \"kúti\" in the following question:\n\nFurther details of intonational tones are given below.\n\nThe accompanying illustration shows the pitch-track of the following sentence:\n\nThe first word, \"anádyétsa\" 'they fed', has an accent theoretically on the antepenultimate syllable. However, in this example, the peak (high point) of the accent does not coincide with the syllable but is delayed, giving the impression that it has spread to two syllables. This process is known as \"tone doubling\" or \"peak delay\", and is usual whenever a verb is followed by an object.\n\nThe second word, \"nyaní\" 'baboon', has an accent on the final syllable, but as usually happens with final accents, it has spread backwards to the penultimate syllable, showing a nearly level or gently rising contour, with only the initial \"n\" being low-pitched. Another feature of a final accent is that it tends not to be very high.\n\nIf it comes at the end of a sentence a final-tone word such as \"nyaní\" can optionally be pronounced as \"nyăni\" with a rising tone on the penultimate and the final syllable low. But if a suffix is added, the stress moves to the new penultimate, and the word is pronounced with a full-height tone: \"nyaní-yo\" 'that baboon'.\n\nThe third word, \"nsómba\" 'fish', has penultimate accent. Since the word ends the sentence, the tone falls from high to low.\n\nAnother point shown in the voice track is that the first accent is higher than the second. This is normal in declarative sentences and is known as downdrift. But when two tones come together, as in \"nyaní nsómba\", there is no downdrift.\n\nThe intensity reading at the top shows that the intensity (loudness) is greatest on the penultimate syllable of each word.\n\nTwo pitch levels, high and low, conventionally written H and L, are usually considered to be sufficient to describe the tones of Chichewa. In Chichewa itself the high tone is called \"mngóli wókwéza\" ('tone of raising'), and the low tone \"mngóli wótsítsa\" ('tone of lowering'). Some authors add a mid-height tone but most do not, but consider a mid-height tone to be merely an allophone of nearby high tones.\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, however, it has been argued that Chichewa tones are best thought of not in terms of H and L, but in terms of H and Ø, that is to say, high-toned vs toneless syllables. The reason is that H tones are much more dynamic than L tones and play a large role in tonal phenomena, whereas L-toned syllables are relatively inert.\n\nTones are not marked in the standard orthography used in Chichewa books and newspapers, but linguists usually indicate a high tone by writing it with an acute accent, as in the first syllable of \"nsómba\". The low tones are generally left unmarked.\n\nThe earliest work to mark the tones of Chichewa words was the Afro-American scholar Mark Hanna Watkins' \"A Grammar of Chichewa\" (1937). This was a pioneering work, since not only was it the first work on Chichewa to include tones, but it was also the first grammar of any African language to be written by an American. The informant used by Watkins was the young Kamuzu Banda, who in 1966 was to become the first President of the Republic of Malawi.\n\nAnother grammar including Chichewa tones was a handbook written for Peace Corps Volunteers, Stevick et al., \"Chinyanja Basic Course\" (1965), which gives very detailed information on the tones of sentences, and also indicates intonations. Its successor, Scotton and Orr (1980) \"Learning Chichewa\", is much less detailed. All three of these works are available on the Internet. J.K. Louw's \"Chichewa: A Practical Course\" (1987) [1980], which contained tone markings, is currently out of print.\nFrom 1976 onwards a number of academic articles by Malawian and Western scholars have been published on different aspects of Chichewa tones. The most recent work discussing the tones of Chichewa is \"The Phonology of Chichewa\" (2017) by Laura Downing and Al Mtenje.\n\nFour dictionaries also mark the tones on Chichewa words. The earliest of these was volume 3 of J.K. Louw's \"Chichewa: A Practical Course\" (1987) [1980]; \"A Learner's Chichewa-English, English-Chichewa Dictionary\" by Botne and Kulemeka (1991), the monolingual \"Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja/Chichewa\" (c.2000) produced by the Centre for Language Studies of the University of Malawi (available online), and the \"Common Bantu On-Line Chichewa Dictionary\" (2001) formerly published online by the University of California in Berkeley.\n\nSo far all the studies which have been published on Chichewa tones have dealt with the Malawian variety of the language. There is no published information available on the tones of Chinyanja spoken in Zambia and Mozambique.\n\nIn order to understand Chichewa tones, it is necessary first to understand various tonal phenomena that can occur, which are briefly outlined below.\n\nNormally in a Chichewa sentence, whenever tones come in the sequence HLH or HLLH, it is usual for the second high tone to be a little lower than the first one. So for example in the word \"ndímapíta\" 'I usually go', the tone of \"ndí\" is pronounced a little higher than the tone of \"pí\". Thus generally speaking the highest tone in a sentence is the first one. This phenomenon, which is common in many Bantu languages, is known as 'downdrift' or 'automatic downstep'.\n\nHowever, there are several exceptions to this rule. Downdrift does not occur, for example, when a speaker is asking a question, or reciting a list of items with a pause after each one, or sometimes if a word is pronounced on a high pitch for emphasis. There is also no downdrift in words like \"wápolísi\" 'policeman', where two high tones in the sequence HLH are bridged to make a plateau HHH (see below).\n\nIn some dialects a high tone may sometimes spread to the following syllable; this is known as 'High Tone Spreading' or 'Tone Doubling'. So where some speakers say \"ndináthandiza\" 'I helped', others will say \"ndináthándiza\". Some phoneticians argue that what happens here, in some cases at least, is that the highest part or 'peak' of the tone moves forward, giving the impression that the tone covers two syllables, a process called 'peak delay'. An illustration of peak delay can be seen clearly in the pitch-track of the word \"anádyetsa\" 'they fed', here pronounced \"anádyétsa\", in Downing et al. (2004).\n\nIn order for HTS to occur, there must be at least 3 syllables following the tone, although not necessarily in the same word.\n\nOne very frequent use of spreading, at least in some dialects, is to link together two words (such as verb + object, or verb of motion + destination, or noun + possessive) into a single phrase. In transcriptions one frequently finds phrases such as \"kuphíká nyama\" 'to cook meat' or \"kusámála mkázi\" 'to care for a wife', \"chímánga chánga\" 'my maize' \"mikángó iyo\" 'those lions' etc. in which the second tone in each phrase is not original but due to spreading. It should be noted, however, that the contexts where spreading occurs vary from one dialect to another.\n\nThere are some verbal forms in which spreading does not occur; for example, the first tone in the present habitual does not spread: \"ndí-ma-thandíza\" 'I usually help'. The tone on -\"ngá\"- and \"-má-\" in negative tenses such as \"sí-ndí-má-thandiza\" 'I never help' and \"si-ndi-ngá-thandíze\" 'I can't help' also does not spread, although it may form a plateau with a 'bumped' tone: \"si-ndi-ngá-wá-phé\" 'I can't kill them'.\n\nIt sometimes happens that the sequence HLH in Chichewa becomes HHH, making a tonal 'plateau'. A tonal plateau is common after the words \"á\" 'of' and \"ndí\" 'and':\n\nBefore a pause the final tone may drop: \"chákúdya\". Sometimes a succession of tones is bridged in this way, e.g. \"gúlewámkúlu\" 'masked dancer', with one long continuous high tone from \"gú\" to \"kú\".\n\nAnother place where a plateau is found is after the initial high tone of subordinate clause verbs such as the following:\n\nAt the end of words, if the tones are HLH, a plateau is common:\n\nHowever, there are exceptions; for example, in the word \"nyényezí 'star' the two tones are kept separate, so that the word is pronounced \"nyényēzī (where \"ī\" represents a slightly lower tone than \"í\").\n\nSequences with two or more toneless syllables between the high tones (e.g. HLLH) do not normally make a plateau in Chichewa. This also applies to words in which one of the syllables has been lost by contraction, such as:\n\nWhen a word or closely connected phrase ends in HHL or HLHL, there is a tendency in Chichewa for the second H to move to the final syllable of the word. This process is known as 'tone shifting' or 'bumping'.\n\nLocal bumping\n\nIn one type of bumping (called 'local bumping') LHHL at the end of a word or phrase becomes LHHH (where the two tones are joined into a plateau): \nAt the end of a sentence the final high tone may drop again, reverting the word to \"anámúpha\".\n\nHowever, in certain verb tenses such as the Present Habitual when the tones are HHL, the penultimate tone is shifted to the final, but there is no plateau. Instead, the two tones are kept separate:\n\nThere is no bumping in HHL words where the first syllable is derived from á 'of':\n\nNon-local bumping\n\nIn another kind (called 'non-local bumping'), HLHL at the end of a word or phrase changes to HLLH or, with spreading of the first high tone, HHLH:\n\nAgain, the Present Habitual is an exception, and when the tones are HLHL, bumping does not occur:\n\nReverse bumping\n\nA related phenomenon, but in reverse, is found when the addition of the suffix \"-tú\" 'really' causes a normally word-final tone to move back one syllable, so that LHH at the end of a word becomes HLH:\n\nCertain suffixes, known as enclitics, add a high tone to the last syllable of the word to which they are joined. When added to a toneless word or a word ending in LL, this high tone can easily be heard. Bumping does not occur when the tones are HLHL:\n\nBut when an enclitic is combined with word which has penultimate high tone, there is local bumping, and the result is a triple tone: \n\nWhen added to a word with final high tone, it raises the tone higher (in Central Region dialects, the rising tone on the first syllable of a word like \"nyŭmbá\" also disappears):\n\nNot all suffixes are tonally enclitic in this way. For example, when added to nouns, locative suffixes (\"-ko\", \"-po\", \"-mo\") do not add a tone, e.g.:\n\nHowever, when added to verbs, the same suffixes add an enclitic tone:\n\nConversely, certain prefixes transfer their high tone to the syllable which follows them. Prefixes of this kind are called 'proclitic' or 'post-accenting'. The following tenses have a proclitic prefix:\n\nThe infinitive:\n\nThe Present Continuous, Recent Past, Recent Past Imperfective, and Immediate Imperative:\n\nThe Present and Perfect participial tenses:\n\nVerbal Adjective with \"-ó-\" (derived from á 'of' + the Infinitive): \n\nAny tense with the infix \"-ngo-\" 'just'. But other prefixes used with \"-ngo-\" are no longer proclitic; instead, the accent goes on the prefix itself:\n\nObject-markers such as \"ndí-\" 'me', \"mú-\" 'him/her' etc. also become proclitic when added to an imperative or subjunctive:\n\nHowever, the aspect-marker \"-ka-\" 'go and' is not proclitic. With an imperative it is toneless, and with a subjunctive it puts tones on itself and the penultimate:\n\nWhen, as often happens, an aspect-marker or object-marker is added to a proclitic tense, extra tones appear on the verb stem, either on the penultimate or on the final:\n\nFurther details are given below.\n\nMeeussen's Rule is a process in several Bantu languages whereby a sequence HH becomes HL. This is frequent in verbs. An example in Chichewa is the infinitive \"kú- + goná\" 'to sleep', where the addition of the proclitic \"kú-\" would normally be expected to produce \"ku-góná\" with two high tones; but by Meeussen's Rule the second tone is dropped, leaving \"ku-góna\" with a high tone on the penultimate only. In the Southern Region, \"a-ná-mú-thandiza\" 'he helped him' is pronounced \"a-ná-mu-thandiza\", presumably also by Meeussen's Rule.\n\nMeeussen's Rule does not apply in every circumstance. For example, a tone derived from spreading is unaffected by it, e.g. \"ku-góná bwino\" 'to sleep well', where the tone of the verb-stem \"goná\", having been deleted by Meeussen's Rule to make \"ku-góna\" 'to sleep', is replaced by spreading when the word is used in a phrase.\n\nAnother instance where Meeussen's Rule does not apply in Chichewa is when the aspect-marker \"-ká-\" 'go and' is added to a verb, for example: \"a-ná-ká-thandiza\" 'he went and helped'. So far from being deleted, this tone in some circumstances can itself spread to the next syllable, e.g. \"a-ná-ká-thándiza\". The tone of an object-marker such as \"-mu-\" 'him' in the same position, however, is deleted by Meeussen's Rule and then replaced by spreading; it does not itself spread: \"a-ná-mú-thandiza\" 'he helped him'.\n\nJust as in English, where in a word like \"zoo \"or \"wood\" or \"now\" the initial voiced consonant has a low pitch compared with the following vowel, the same is true of Chichewa. Thus Trithart marks the tones of initial consonants such as [m], [n], [z], and [dz] in some words as Low.\n\nHowever, an initial nasal consonant is not always pronounced with a low pitch. After a high tone it can acquire a high tone itself, e.g. \"wá ḿsodzi\" 'of the fisherman' The consonants \"n\" and \"m\" can also have a high tone when contracted from \"ndí\" 'and' or high-toned \"-mú-\", e.g. \"ḿmakhálá kuti?\" (short for \"múmakhálá kuti?\") 'where do you live?'.\n\nIn some Southern African Bantu languages such as Zulu a voiced consonant at the beginning of a syllable not only has a low pitch itself, but can also lower the pitch of all or part of the following vowel. Such consonants are known as 'depressor consonants'. The question of whether Chichewa has depressor consonants was first considered by Trithart (1976) and further by Cibelli (2012). According to data collected by Cibelli, a voiced or nasalised consonant does indeed have a small effect on the tone of a following vowel, making it a semitone or more lower; so that for example the second vowel of \"ku-gúla\" 'to buy' would have a slightly lower pitch than that of \"ku-kúla\" 'to grow' or \"ku-khála\" 'to sit'. When the vowel is toneless, the effect is less, but it seems that there is still a slight difference. The effect of depressor consonants in Chichewa, however, is much less noticeable than in Zulu.\n\nLexical tones are the tones of individual words - or the lack of tones, since quite a large number of words in Chichewa (including over a third of nouns and most verbs in their basic form) are toneless and pronounced with all their syllables on a low pitch.\n\nIn the CBOLD Chichewa dictionary, about 36% of Chichewa nouns are toneless, 57% have one tone, and only 7% have more than one tone. When there is one tone, it is generally on one of the last three syllables. Nouns with a tone more than three syllables from the end are virtually all foreign borrowings, such as \"sékondale\" 'secondary school'.\n\nComparison with other Bantu languages shows that for the most part the tones of nouns in Chichewa correspond to the tones of their cognates in other Bantu languages, and are therefore likely to be inherited from an earlier stage of Bantu. An exception is that nouns which at an earlier period had HH (such as \"nsómba\" 'fish', from proto-Bantu \"*cómbá\") have changed in Chichewa to HL by Meeussen's rule. Two-syllable nouns in Chichewa can therefore have the tones HL, LH, or LL, these three being about equally common, but (discounting the fact that LH words are usually in practice pronounced HH) there are no nouns with the underlying tones HH.\n\nThe class-prefix of nouns, such as (class 7) \"chi-\" in \"chikóndi\" 'love', or (class 3) \"m-\" in \"mténgo\" 'tree', is usually toneless. However, there are some exceptions such as \"chímanga\" 'maize'. The three nouns \"díso\" 'eye', \"dzíno\" 'tooth', and \"líwu\" 'sound or word' are irregular in that the high tone moves from the prefix to the stem in the plural, making \"masó\", \"manó\", and \"mawú\" respectively.\n\nAs noted above, in isolation these words are actually pronounced \"bwālō\", \"Chichēwā\", etc., ending with two tones of mid height. Alternatively, in some dialects, they may be pronounced \"bwălò\", \"Chichĕwà\", with a rising tone on the penultimate and a low tone on the final.\n\nThis group is less common than the first three. Many of the words with this tone are loanwords from Portuguese or English such as:\n\nA small number of words (mostly compounds) have more than one tone. Some are compounded with á 'of', which has a high tone, so that \"wá\" + \"ntchíto\" 'man of work' becomes \"wántchíto\" 'worker' with two tones joined in a plateau. In words with the sequence HLH like \"wá-pólísi\" 'policeman' the high tones usually bridge to make HHH. Verbal forms such as \"Lólémba\" 'Monday' (short for \"Lá kúlémba\" 'the (day) of writing') are also originally plateaux. Plateaux are marked with underlining:\n\nThe prefix \"chi-\" in some words adds two high tones, one following \"chi-\" and one on the final. The first may spread forwards and the second backwards, but the two tones are kept separate with the second lower than the first:\n\nIf there are only three syllables following the prefix \"chi-\", the two tones link into an HHH plateau:\n\nThe (L)HHH pattern is also found in a few other words (all of them compounds):\n\nLess common patterns are found in:\n\nThe following, however, have two separate tones and no plateau. The second tone is lower than the first:\n\nAdjectives in Chichewa are usually formed with word \"á\" (\"wá\", \"yá\", \"chá\", \"zá\" etc. according to noun class) 'of', which has a high tone. The high tone tends to spread to the following word. When there is a sequence of HLH, the tones will bridge to make HHH:\n\nCombined with an infinitive, á and \"ku-\" usually merge (except usually in monosyllabic verbs) into a high-toned ó-:\n\nSome people make a slight dip between the two tones:\n\nPossessive adjectives are also made with \"á-\". As explained in the section on bumping, their tone may change when they follow a noun ending in HL, LH or HH. The concords shown below are for noun classes 1 and 2:\n\n\nThe adjective \"wína\" 'another, a certain' has similar tones to \"wánga\":\n\nThe adjective \"wamba\" 'ordinary', however, is not made with á and has a low tone on both syllables. The first syllable \"wa\" in this word does not change with the class of noun.\n\nThe following three adjectives have their own concords and are not formed using \"á\". Here they are shown with the concords of classes 1 and 2:\n\n\nAs with possessives, the high tone of these may shift by bumping after a noun ending in HL or LH or HH.\n\nWith these three the high tone also shifts before a demonstrative suffix: \"yemwé-yo\" 'that same one', \"zonsé-zi\" 'all these'. (In this they differ from \"wánga\" and \"wína\", which do not shift the tone with a demonstrative suffix, e.g. \"anthu éna-wa\" 'these other people'.) The tone also shifts in the word álí-yensé 'each, each and every', in which \"áli\" has the tones of a relative-clause verb.\n\nThe following demonstrative adjectives (shown here with the concords for noun classes 1 and 2) usually have a low tone:\n\nThe first of these (\"uyo\"), however, can be pronounced \"úyo!\" with a high tone if referring to someone a long way away. The word \"uti/ati?\" can also acquire an intonational tone in certain types of questions (see below).\n\nChichewa has the numbers 1 to 5 and 10. These all have penultimate high tone except for \"-sanu\" 'five', which is toneless. The adjectives meaning 'how many?' and 'several' also take the number concords and can be considered part of this group. They are here illustrated with the concords for noun classes 1 and 2 (note that \"khúmi\" has no concord):\n\nThe numbers \"zaná '100' and \"chikwí '1000' exist but are rarely used. It is possible to make other numbers using circumlocutions (e.g. 'five tens and units five and two' = 57) but these are not often heard, the usual practice being to use English numbers instead.\n\nThe first and second person pronouns are toneless, but the third person pronouns have a high tone:\n\nThese combine with \"ndi\" as follows:\n\nThe following monosyllabic words are commonly used. The following are toneless:\n\nThe following have a high tone:\n\nThese words are joined rhythmically to the following word. The high tone can spread to the first syllable of the following word, provided it has at least three syllables: They can also make a plateau with the following word, if the tones are HLH:\n\nThe word \"pa\" has a tone when it means 'of' following a noun of class 16:\n\nIt also has a tone in certain idiomatic expressions such as \"pá-yekha\" or \"pá-yékha\" 'on his own'.\n\nThe tones of ideophones (expressive words) have also been investigated by linguists. Examples are: \"bálálábálálá\" 'scattering in all directions' (all syllables very high), \"lólolo\" 'lots and lots' (with gradually descending tones), \"bii!\" 'very dark or dirty' (low pitch). It can be seen that the tonal patterns of ideophones do not necessarily conform to the patterns of other words in the language.\n\nChichewa verbs are mostly toneless in their basic form, although a few have a high tone (usually on the final vowel). However, unlike the situation with the lexical tones of nouns, there is no correlation at all between the high-toned verbs in Chichewa and the high-toned verbs in other Bantu languages. The obvious conclusion is that the high tones of verbs are not inherited from an earlier stage of Bantu but have developed independently in Chichewa.\n\nWhen a verbal extension is added to a high-toned root, the resulting verb is also usually high-toned, e.g.\n\nCertain extensions, especially those which change a verb from transitive to intransitive, or which make it intensive, also add a tone. According to Kanerva (1990) and Mchombo (2004), the passive ending \"-idwa/-edwa\" also adds a high tone, but this appears to be true only of the Nkhotakota dialect which they describe.\nHigh-toned verb roots are comparatively rare (only about 13% of roots), though the proportion rises when verbs with stative and intensive extensions are added. In addition there are a number of verbs, such as \"peza/pezá\" 'find' which can be pronounced either way. In the monolingual dictionary \"Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja\" 2683 verbs are given, with 10% marked as high-toned, and 4% as having either tone. In the Southern Region of Malawi, some speakers do not pronounce the tones of high-toned verbs at all or only sporadically.\n\nThe difference between high and low-toned verbs is neutralised when they are used in a verb tense which has a high tone on the penultimate or on the final syllable.\n\nThree irregular verbs, \"-téro\" 'do so', \"-tére\" 'do like this', and \"-táni?\" 'do what?', have a tone on the penultimate syllable.\n\nThe view held in Mtenje (1986) that Chichewa also has 'rising-tone' verbs has been dropped in his more recent work.\n\nLow-toned verbs\n\nMonosyllabic verbs such as the following are always low-toned, although nouns derived from them, such as \"imfá\" 'death', can have a tone:\n\nHigh-toned verbs\n\nVerbs with either tone\n\nStative verbs\n\nMost intransitive verbs with the endings \"-iká\", \"-eká\", \"-uká\", \"-oká\" derived from simpler verb-stems are high-toned. This is especially true when a transitive verb has been turned by a suffix into an intransitive one:\n\nHowever, there are some common exceptions such as the following which are low-toned:\n\nIntensive verbs\n\nIntensive verbs with the endings \"-its(its)á\" and \"-ets(ets)á\" always have a high tone on the final syllable, even when derived from low-toned verbs. A few intensive verbs with the endings \"-irirá\" or \"-ererá\" are also high-toned:\n\nIn addition to the lexical tones which go with individual words, Chichewa also has grammatical tones which apply to verbs. Each different tense has its own tonal pattern or melody, which is superimposed on top of whatever lexical tone the verb-stem itself may have. \n\nThere are at least eight different tonal patterns in ordinary positive tenses, while others are used in negative tenses or relative clause tenses.\n\nSometimes two tenses have the same tense-marker and are distinguished by tone alone, as with the Present Habitual and the Past Imperfective. The Present Habitual has two tones, one on the subject-marker and the other on the penultimate, while the Past Imperfective has a tone following the tense-marker:\n\nIn the examples, hyphens have been added for clarity; they are not used in the standard orthography.\n\nSome tenses, such as the Perfect, are toneless. In toneless tenses all the syllables are pronounced low, unless the verb-stem itself has a high tone (e.g. \"nd-a-goná\" 'I have lain down'):\n\nOther toneless tenses are the simple Imperative (\"thandiza!\" 'help!'), the Potential (also called 'Permissive') (\"ndi-nga-thandize\" 'I can help'), and the \"-ka-\" tense meaning 'when' or 'if' (\"ndi-ka-fotokoza\" 'if/when I explain').\n\nOne tense, the Subjunctive, has a high tone on the final vowel:\n\nThe Infinitive, Present Progressive, Recent Past, and Past Imperfective all have a proclitic tone, that is, a high tone is heard on the syllable immediately following the tense-marker:\n\nIf the verb is monosyllabic, the tone often spreads backwards or regresses to the penultimate:\n\nIn the Past Simple/Remote Perfect, whether made with \"-na-\" or \"-da-\", the tone comes on the tense-marker itself. This tone can also spread to the next syllable in longer verbs in some dialects:\n\nAnother tense with tense-marker tone is the perfect conditional:\n\nThe Present Simple, which often refers to events in the near future, has a high tone on the initial syllable, that is, on the subject-marker \"ndi-\" 'I'. In some dialects this high tone will spread (or shift forward) to the second syllable in longer verbs (that is, verbs where the high tone is followed by at least three toneless syllables):\n\nIn some dialects the two future tenses with \"-dzá-\" and \"-ká-\" have a tone on both the subject prefix and the tense-marker:\n\nHowever, in other dialects the first tone is dropped, and only the tense-marker has a tone:\n\nThe Present Habitual has a high tone on the initial syllable and another on the penultimate. But if the verb-stem is monosyllabic, the second tone is heard on the final syllable instead of the penultimate. Because of downdrift, the second high tone is slightly lower in pitch than the first.\n\nWhen the verb is monosyllabic, the second tone is on the final, unless there is an object-marker: \n\nIn this tense the first tone never spreads to \"-ma-\". \n\nThe Future Continuous also has this tonal pattern:\n\nThe Remote Past (with \"-naa-\" or \"-daa-\") is similar, but the first tone usually spreads to the second syllable:\n\nAnother tense with this tone-pattern is the not commonly used 'continuative' subjunctive:\n\nThe Remote Past Imperfective also has two tones, but on the tense-marker and the penultimate. The second tone disappears if the verb is monosyllabic. The tone on \"-ká-\" never spreads:\n\nThe same pattern is found in the Necessitative (= Imperfective Subjunctive). In some dialects this tense is formed with \"-dzi-\" instead of \"-zi-\":\n\nAs noted above, some verb stems have an inherent lexical tone, for example \"goná\" 'lie down', \"siyá\" 'leave (something)', \"yang'anitsitsá\" 'examine carefully'. When such a verb is used to make a tense, the tone can usually be heard on the final syllable. The tone can be heard most easily when the tense-melody is toneless, as in the Perfect tense:\n\nHowever, it can also be heard when there is another high tone in the verb, provided this tone is not in one of the last two syllables:\n\nIf the tense-pattern puts a tone on the antepenultimate syllable (so that the verb ends HLH), the two tones will link up, making a plateau:\n\nHowever, if the tonal pattern of the tense puts a tone on the penultimate or the final syllable, the tone of the verb-stem cannot be heard; in the first case because it is deleted by Meeussen's Rule, and in the second, because the two tones coincide:\n\nCertain modifications of the tones of a tense take place when the verb-stem is a short one, i.e. of only one syllable, such as \"-dya\" 'eat', or two syllables, such as \"ona\" 'see'.\n\nIn most tenses, a penultimate tone moves to the final if the verb is monosyllabic. But if there is an aspect-marker or object-marker, the penultimate tone goes on that:\n\nIn the 'not yet' tense with \"-na-\", however, the penultimate tone remains penultimate:\n\nIt also remains penultimate in the negative future with \"-dza-\" or \"-ka-\":\n\nWhen the shortening of a verb would mean that the verb ends LHH, the second tone disappears:\n\nWhen a verb has two syllables, in most cases, if the ending would normally be HHL, the second tone shifts to the final, usually making a tonal plateau:\n\nHowever, when a monosyllabic verb is preceded by \"-ná-ká-\" 'went and', this bumping does not occur:\n\nNegative tenses in Chichewa tend to have a different tonal pattern from the corresponding positive ones. \n\nIn general, negative intonations can be divided into two groups: \n\nConsequently in some tenses, there are two negative intonations with different meanings. For example, the Remote Perfect (Simple Past) has a tone on \"sí-\" and the penultimate when it means \"didn't\", but a single tone on the penultimate when it means \"have not yet\":\n\n\nThe negative Present Simple / Near Future also has two intonations, depending on whether the meaning is present or future:\n\nThe negative tonal melodies are as follows:\n\nThe Present Simple, in its habitual, non-future sense, has a tone on the initial syllables only. This second tone does not spread even in longer verbs and is presumably itself due to spreading:\n\nHowever, if an object-marker is added, there is an extra tone on the penultimate syllable:\n\nIn monosyllabic verbs, in the Central Region, the tone on the subject-marker disappears in the Present Simple and the tones are:\n\nThe negative Remote Perfect tense with \"-na-\" or \"-da-\" has tones on the negative prefix \"sí-\" and the penultimate. The first tone may spread. The ending changes to \"-e\":\n\nIn a monosyllabic verb, the second tone goes on the final, unless there is an object-marker:\n\nThe negative perfect participial tense has tones very similar to the above, with the first tone on the initial syllable and the second on the penultimate. The first tone may spread:\n\nThe Remote Past Imperfective has three tones when negative. The first may spread. The \"n\" of \"nká\" is syllabic and low-toned, so there is no plateau between the first and second tone:\n\nIn a monosyllabic verb, the third tone is lost:\n\nTenses with proclitic tense-markers, such as the Present Continuous, have a tone on \"sí\" and a second tone immediately following the tense-marker:\n\nIf the aspect-marker \"-ma-\" is added to any negative tense, it carries a high tone; otherwise the tones are similar to the same tenses without \"-ma-\":\n\nWhen an object-marker is added there is an additional tone on the penultimate:\n\nThe negative Perfect Conditional can also optionally have this intonation:\n\nAny negative tense with future meaning, or with the meaning 'not yet', has only one tone, on the penultimate syllable. Other tones, such as those of the negative prefix \"sí-\" and the object-marker, are suppressed:\n\nThe same intonation, with a tone on the penultimate, is found in non-finite tenses such as the negative Infinitive and negative Subjunctive, which have the negative-marker \"-sa-\" following the subject-marker:\n\nWhen these patterns are used with a monosyllabic verb such as \"-dya\" 'eat', the tone usually goes on the final syllable:\n\nHowever, in the forms with \"-dza-\" and \"-na-\" the tone goes on the penultimate:\n\nIt also goes on the penultimate if a monosyllabic verb is preceded by an object-marker:\n\nThe negative Future Continuous and negative Potential have tones on tense-marker and penultimate. The tone on the tense-marker does not spread:\n\nIn a monosyllabic verb, the two tones coincide:\n\nThe negative infinitive with the aspect-marker \"-ma-\" has the same tones:\n\nIn a monosyllabic verb, the second tone is lost by Meeussen's Rule:\n\nCertain tenses have a different tonal pattern when used in certain kinds of dependent clauses. Stevick calls this intonation the 'relative mood' of the verb, since it is frequently used in relative clauses; however, it is also used in a range of other dependent clauses, such as conditional clauses ('if...'), cleft sentences ('it is he who...'), and adverbial clauses of time, place, manner, and concession. Often the use of relative clause intonation alone can show that a verb is being used in the meaning of a relative or conditional clause.\n\nThe dependent-clause intonation generally has two high tones, one on the initial syllable and another on the penultimate. High tones between these two are suppressed. The first high tone may spread. When the tones are HLHL, some dialects have bumping; for example, \"ndí-na-gúla\" '(which) I bought' can become \"ndí-ná-gulá\".\n\n\nBut when the tense has a proclitic prefix the second high tone comes on the syllable after the tense-marker. There is usually bridging of the two tones, as well as a bridging with the tone of the relative pronoun \"améne\":\n\nIf the verb has only one syllable, the second high tone is dropped at the end of a phrase:\n\nIt will be noted that the participial tenses also use the relative clause intonation.\n\nIf the verb tense already has a high tone on the initial syllable, such as the Present Simple, Present Habitual, and Remote Future, there is no change when the verb is used in a relative clause. Negative tenses, such as \"s-a-na-thandíze\" 'he hasn't helped yet', are also unaltered when used in dependent clauses.\n\nThe relative clause intonation is used most often in relative clauses, for example after \"améne\" or \"yemwé\" 'who'. The tone of \"améne\" spreads to make a plateau with the high tone of the relative clause verb:\n\nThe relative clause intonation is also used in temporal clauses after \"paméne\" 'when' and in clauses of manner after \"momwé\" 'in the way in which', which are derived from the same roots:\n\nIt is also used if the word \"améne\" or \"paméne\" is omitted, the relative clause intonation alone showing that the verb is being used in a relative way:\n\nQuestions with \"ndaní?\" 'who?' and \"nchiyáni?\" 'what?' are expressed as cleft sentences, using relative clause intonation:\n\nThe dependent clause intonation is also used in conditional clauses, except those with the toneless \"-ka-\" tense. An example can be observed in the following proverb, where the dependent verb has a different intonation from the main verb:\n\nIt is similarly used after \"ngati\" 'if' and in clauses after \"ngakhále\" 'although':\n\nHowever, when \"ngati\" means 'as if', the ordinary intonation is used.\n\nAs well as the word \"ndi\" 'is/are' used for identity (e.g. 'he is a teacher') Chichewa has another verb \"-li\" 'am, are, is' used for position or temporary state (e.g. 'he is well', 'he is in Lilongwe'). The tones of this are irregular in that in the Present Simple, there is no tone on the subject-marker. For the Remote Past, both \"á-naa-lí\" and \"a-ná-li\" can be heard, apparently without difference of meaning. In the dependent Applied Present (\"-lili\"), used in clauses of manner, the two tones make a plateau.\n\nIn main clauses:\n\nIn dependent clauses:\n\nThe dependent-clause form of the Persistive tense is frequently heard in the phrase \"pá-kada-lí pano\" 'at the present time' (literally, 'it still being now').\n\nAfter the tense-marker, there can be one or more aspect-markers, which add precision to the meaning of the tense. Altogether there are four aspect-markers, \"-má-\" 'ever, usually, always', \"-ká-\" 'go and', \"-dzá-\" 'in future', and \"-ngo-\" 'just', which are always added in that order, though not usually all at once. These infixes add extra high tones to the verb.\n\nThe aspect-marker \"-má-\" 'always, ever, generally' usually adds two high tones, one on \"-má-\" itself and one on the penultimate syllable. For example, when added to the 'when' tense, which has the toneless tense-marker \"-ka-\", it adds two tones:\n\nHowever, in the Present Habitual, the tone on \"-má-\" is lost:\n\nOn the other hand, in the negative Present Habitual, the tone on \"-má-\" is retained while the penultimate tone is lost, unless there is an object-marker: \n\n\"-má-\" can also be used as a tense-marker itself to make the Imperfect tense, in which case its high tone is proclitic: \n\nThe aspect-markers \"-ká-\" 'go to' and \"-dzá-\" 'in future' or 'come to' have the same tones as each other. In the Remote Perfect, the tone is high, and in longer verbs sometimes spreads:\n\nIn a monosyllabic verb in this tense, unlike with the object-marker, the tone of \"-ká-\" does not bump to the final:\n\nIn tenses which have a tone on the penultimate, \"-ká-\" and \"-dzá-\" usually lose their tone:\n\nBut in monosyllabic verbs, the tone remains:\n\nThe high tone is also lost in the Imperative, where there is a tone on the final syllable only:\n\nBut in the positive Subjunctive \"-ká-\" and \"-dzá-\" retain their tone, and there is a second tone on the penultimate. This second tone is lost in monosyllabic verbs:\n\nThe aspect-marker \"-ngo-\" 'just' is derived from the infinitive, and like the infinitive it is proclitic, that is to say, there is a high tone on the syllable after \"-ngo-\". (The syllable \"-ngo-\" itself is always toneless.)\n\nIn toneless tenses, the syllables before it are toneless: \n\nIn all other tenses, \"-ngo-\" also has a high tone in front of itself:\n\nIf \"-ngo-\" is added after a proclitic tense-marker such as the Present Continuous \"-ku-\", the tense-marker keeps its high tone and is no longer proclitic:\n\nBetween the aspect-markers and the verb stem, it is possible to add an object-marker such as \"-mú-\" 'him/her/it' or \"-zí-\" 'those things' etc. In some tenses, the object-marker retains its tone, but in some the tone is lost. In others, the object-marker adds a tone, but not on itself.\n\nWhen an object-marker is added to a toneless tense, such as the Perfect, it has a high tone. (In verbs of three syllables or longer, the tone may spread in some dialects.)\n\nIn tenses which have penultimate tone the object-marker is usually toneless:\n\nBut when the verb is monosyllabic, the penultimate tone goes on the object-marker itself:\n\nIn the Remote Perfect (Past Simple) tense, which has the tense-marker \"-ná-\" or \"-dá-\", the tone of the object-marker is lost in southern dialects. In dialects with high tone spreading, the object-marker has a high tone, but it is thought that this tone is due to spreading, as it does not spread further to the following syllable, unlike the tone of \"-ká-\". \n\nWith monosyllabic verb-stems, however, the high tone of the object-marker is retained and (unlike the tone of \"-ká-\") undergoes bumping, making a plateau:\n\nWhere the tense-marker or aspect-marker has proclitic tone, for example in the infinitive, Present Continuous, or Recent Past, there is an additional tone on the penultimate in longer verbs, or on the final in verbs of 2 or 3 syllables. This second tone disappears if the verb has only one syllable:\n\nThis is similar to the effect of adding the aspect-marker \"-má-\", except that in three-syllable verbs with \"-má-\" the second tone is heard on the penultimate:\n\nIn the Subjunctive and Imperative the high tone of the object-marker becomes proclitic and is heard on the syllable which follows it. The final vowel changes to \"-e\" and has a tone. There is a plateau if the verb stem has three syllables:\n\nIf the verb has two syllables, the tone on the final is dropped by Meeussen's rule:\n\nIf the verb is monosyllabic, the tone remains on \"-mú-\", and the high tone of the final vowel is dropped: \n\nWhen the Imperative is preceded by the aspect-markers \"ta-\" ('do it now!') or \"i-ngo-\" ('just do it!'), which are proclitic, the rules for proclitic verbs given above apply:\n\nWhen \"-ka-\" or \"-dza-\" are added to an Imperative, they are toneless, and the tone of the object-marker remains proclitic:\n\nBut when \"-ká-\" or \"-dzá-\" is added to the Subjunctive, there are tones on \"-ká-\" and the penultimate, and the object-marker loses its tone:\n\nThe reflexive-marker \"-dzí-\" in most dialects has exactly the same tones as object-markers such as \"-mú-\", but for some speakers in parts of the Central Region there is also an extra tone on the penultimate or final syllable.\n\nIn addition to the ordinary lexical tones which go with individual words, and the grammatical tones of verb tenses, other tones can be heard which show phrasing or indicate a question.\n\nQuite often, if there is a pause in the middle of sentence, such as might be indicated by a comma in writing, the speaker's voice will rise on the syllable just before the pause. This rising tone is called a boundary tone. A boundary tone is typically used after the topic of a sentence, at the end of a dependent clause, after items on a list, and so on. The illustration included here of the sentence \"Mwamúna, ámulamúlá amáyi\" ('A man, he rules women') clearly shows the rise in the voice on the last syllable of the word \"mwamúna\", which is here taken to be the topic of the sentence.\n\nA typical sentence where the dependent clause precedes the main clause is the following:\n\nAs Kanerva points out, the rising boundary tone is not used when the order is reversed and the dependent clause follows the main clause.\n\nAnother kind of tone considered to be a boundary tone, but this time a low one, is the optional fall in the speaker's voice at the end of sentences which causes the final high tone on words like \"chákúdyá\" 'food' to drop to become \"chákúdya\". The end-of-sentence boundary tone is marked L% in Myers' illustration.\n\nBoth Kanerva and Stevick also mention a 'level' boundary tone, which occurs mid-sentence, but without any rise in pitch.\n\nQuestions in Chichewa often add high tones where an ordinary statement has no tone. For example, with the word \"kuti?\" 'where?', \"liti\" 'when?', \"yani\" 'who?' or \"chiyáni\" 'what?' some people add a tone on the last syllable of the preceding word. This tone does not spread backwards, although it may form a plateau with an antepenultimate tone, as in the 3rd and 4th examples below:\n\nBut as Stevick points out, not all speakers do this, and others may say \"mu-ná-fika liti?\"\n\nWhen \"kuti?\" 'which place?' or \"liti?\" 'which day?' are preceded by \"ndi\" 'is', they take a high tone on the first syllable:\n\nIt appears that with some speakers the high tone after \"ndi\" is heard on the final syllable in forms of this adjective which begin with a vowel; but with other speakers it is heard on the first syllable:\n\nA high tone also goes on the final syllable in \"ndaní?\" '(it is) who?' (which is derived from \"ndi yani?\") Before this word and \"nchiyáni?\" '(is) what?', since such questions are phrased as a cleft sentence or relative clause, the verb has its relative-clause intonation:\n\nThe relative-clause intonation of the verb is also used when a question begins with \"bwánji?\" 'how come?', but not when it ends with \"bwánji?\", when it has the meaning 'how?'\n\nWith yes-no questions, intonations vary. The simplest tone is a rising boundary tone on the final syllable:\n\nA more insistent question often has a HL falling boundary tone on the last syllable. Pitch transcriptions show that the voice rises up on the penultimate and falls on the final:\n\nBut in other dialects, it seems that this fall may begin on the penultimate syllable:\n\nIf there is already a penultimate high tone it may simply be raised higher:\n\nAlternatively, there can be two successive falling tones, one on the penultimate, and another on the final.\n\nSometimes, however, there is no particular intonational tone and the question has the same intonation as a statement, especially if the question starts with the question-asking word \"kodí\".\n\nWhen there is a choice between two things in a disjunctive question, the first half of the question ends in a high boundary tone, but the voice drops in the second half:\n\nSome speakers add intonational tones also with the toneless word \"kale\" 'already', making not only the final syllable of \"kale\" itself high but also the last syllable of the verb which precedes it:\n\nOther speakers do not add these intonational tones, but pronounce \"ndavina kale\" with Low tones.\n\nOccasionally a verb which is otherwise low-toned will acquire a high tone in certain idiomatic usages, e.g. \"ndapitá\" 'I'm off' (said on parting), from the normally toneless \"pita\" 'go'. This can perhaps also be considered a kind of intonational tone.\n\nIn European languages it is common for a word which is picked out for contrast to be pronounced on a higher pitch than the other words in a sentence, e.g. in the sentence \"they fed the baboon fish, not the elephant\", it is likely that the speaker will draw attention to the word \"baboon\" by pronouncing it on a high pitch, while the word \"fish\", which has been mentioned already, will be on a low pitch. This kind of emphasis is known as 'focus'. In tonal languages it appears that this raising or lowering of the pitch to indicate focus is either absent or much less noticeable.\n\nA number of studies have examined how focus is expressed in Chichewa and whether it causes a rise in pitch. One finding was that for most speakers, focus has no effect on pitch. For some speakers, however, it appears that there is a slight rise in pitch if a word with a tone is focussed. A toneless word, when in focus, does not appear to rise in pitch.\n\nA different kind of emphasis is emphasis of degree. To show that something is very small, or very large, or very distant, a Chichewa-speaker will often raise the pitch of his or her voice considerably, breaking the sequence of downdrift. For example, a word such as \"kwámbíri\" 'very much' or \"pang'óno\" 'a little' is sometimes pronounced with a high pitch. The toneless demonstrative \"uyo\" 'that man' can also acquire a tone and become \"úyo!\" with a high pitch to mean 'that man over there in the distance'.\n\nSometimes two nouns are distinguished by their tone patterns alone, e.g. \n\nVerbs can also sometimes be distinguished by tone alone:\n\nThere is also a distinction between:\n\nHowever, minimal pairs of this kind which differ in lexical tone are not particularly common.\n\nMore significant are minimal pairs in verbs, where a change of tones indicates a change in the tense, or a difference between the same tense used in a main clause and in a subordinate clause, for example:\n\n\nReduplicated words are those in which an element is repeated, such as \"chipolopolo\" 'bullet'. The tones of these have been extensively studied in the literature.\n\nIn nouns, the two elements join as follows (note that hyphens have been added here for clarity, but are not used in the standard orthography of Chichewa).\n\nLL + LL becomes LLLL (i.e. there is no additional tone):\n\nLH + LH becomes LHLL (i.e. the second tone is dropped):\n\nHL + HL becomes HLLH (or HHLH), by 'bumping':\n\nWhen adverbs are reduplicated, however, and there is an element of emphasis, the first two types have an additional tone. Thus:\n\nLL + LL becomes LLHL (i.e. there is an additional high tone on the second element):\n\nLH + LH is also different when emphatic, becoming LHHH (or in the Southern Region HHHH):\n\nWhen a three-syllable element is repeated, there is no special change:\n\nA high tone following a proclitic tense-marker does not repeat when the verb is reduplicated:\n\nHowever, a final or penultimate tone will usually repeat (unless the verb has only two syllables, in which case the middle tone may be suppressed):\n\nIdeophones (expressive words) have slightly different types of reduplication. Moto (1999) mentions the following types:\n\nAll High:\n\nAll low:\n\nHigh on the first syllable only:\n\nLuganda tones\n\n\n"}

{"id": "872956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=872956", "title": "Columella", "text": "Columella\n\nLucius Junius Moderatus Columella (; 4 – c. 70 AD) was a prominent writer on agriculture in the Roman empire.\n\nHis \"De Re Rustica\" in twelve volumes has been completely preserved and forms an important source on Roman agriculture, together with the works of Cato the Elder and Varro, both of which he occasionally cites. A smaller book on trees, \"De arboribus\", is usually attributed to him.\n\nIn 1794 the Spanish botanists Jose Antonio Pavón y Jimenez and Hipólito Ruiz López named a genus of Peruvian asterid \"Columellia\" in his honour.\n\nLittle is known of Columella's life. He was probably born in Gades, Hispania Baetica (modern Cádiz), possibly to Roman parents. After a career in the army (he was tribune in Syria in 35), he turned to farming his estates at Ardea, Carseoli, and Alba in Latium.\n\nIn ancient times, Columella's work \"appears to have been but little read\", cited only by Pliny the Elder, Servius, Cassiodorus, and Isidorus, and having fallen \"into almost complete neglect\" after Palladius published an abridgement of it.\n\nThis book is presented as advice to a certain Publius Silvinus. Previously known only in fragments, the complete book was among those discovered in monastery libraries in Switzerland and France by Poggio Bracciolini and his assistant Bartolomeo di Montepulciano during the Council of Constance, between 1414 and 1418.\n\nStructure of \"De Re Rustica\" (\"On Rural Affairs\"):\n\nBook 10 is written entirely in dactylic hexameter verse, in imitation of or homage to, Virgil. It may initially have been intended to be the concluding volume, books 11 and 12 being perhaps an addition to the original scheme.\n\nA complete but anonymous translation into English was published by Millar in 1745. Excerpts had previously been translated by Bradley.\n\nThe short work \"De arboribus\", \"On Trees\", is in manuscripts and early editions of Columella considered as book 3 of \"De Re Rustica\". However it is clear from the opening sentences that it is part of a separate and possibly earlier work. As the anonymous translator of the Millar edition notes (p. 571), there is in \"De arboribus\" no mention of the Publius Silvinus to whom the \"De Re Rustica\" is addressed. A recent critical edition of the Latin text of the \"De Re Rustica\" of Columella includes it, but as \"incerti auctoris\", by an unknown hand. Cassiodorus mentions sixteen books of Columella, which has led to the suggestion that \"De arboribus\" formed part of a work in four volumes.\n\nIn addition to Cato the Elder and Varro, Columella used many sources that are no longer extant and for which he is one of the few references. These include works by Aulus Cornelius Celsus, the Carthaginian writer Mago, Tremellius Scrofa, and many Greek sources. His uncle Marcus Columella, \"a clever man and an exceptional farmer\" (VII.2.30), had conducted experiments in sheep breeding, crossing colourful wild rams, introduced from Africa for gladiatorial games, with domestic sheep, and may have influenced his nephew's interests. Columella owned farms in Italy; he refers specifically to estates at Ardea, Carseoli, and Alba, and speaks repeatedly of his own practical experience in agriculture.\n\nThe earliest editions of Columella group his works with those on agriculture of Cato the Elder, Varro Reatinus and Palladius. Some modern library catalogues follow Brunet in listing these under \"Rei rusticae scriptores\" or \"Scriptores rei rusticae\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mahadevan) (8 September 1913 – 5 May 1957) was a 20th-century Tamil writer, known for his witty and humorous stories.;\n\nDevan was a competent and accomplished writer, who used several interesting and varied techniques in fiction writing. From travelogues to recipes, from detective stories to social dramas, he has written them all.\n\nDevan was born in 1913 at Thiruvidaimarudur in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, India, where he did his schooling. He came to Kumbakonam Government College to complete his B.A. degree. He worked as a school teacher for a year, before joining the popular Tamil weekly magazine, Ananda Vikatan in 1933. Devan's first foray into the world of writing was through the humorous short story \"Mister Rajamani\", written when he was in his twenties.\n\nDevan started as a Sub-Editor at Ananda Vikatan in 1933. After Kalki Krishnamurthy left Vikatan, worked as Managing Editor from 1942 to 1957.\n\nDuring this time, he wrote about 20 serials, more than 500 stories, articles and travelogues. A common feature in all his works was his gentle sense of humour. He was a very popular writer and stories abound of how, when a new issue of Ananda Vikatan came out, everyone in the family would fight to get hold of the copy first.\n\nDevan worked under famous writers like Kalki Krishnamurthy and S. S. Vasan. It was his wish that his stories get published as books, but sadly this did not happen in his lifetime, due to the nature of his contract with Vikatan.\n\nDuring this time, he also served as Chairman of the Tamil Writers' Guild twice, and helped to promote Tamil literature.\n\nDevan was the editor of Ananda Vikatan until his death in 1957. In his short life, he experimented with different types of writing – travelogues, detective novels, articles, short stories, travelogues, current affairs. Devan's books are a joy to read even today, when social values and techniques in fiction writing are so different.\n\nAbout ten of Devan's writings were also dramatised by several Tamil drama troupes, even during his lifetime. He himself wrote most of the dialogues for the plays. More recently, some of his works like Thuppariyum Sambu, Sriman Sudharsanam and Mister Vedhantham were made into television serials also. Only one of his novels, gOmathiyin kAdhalan, was made into a movie, starring T. R. Ramachandran and Savithri.\n\nAll of Devan's stories and travelogues were serialised in Ananda Vikatan (with, perhaps, one exception, 'Mythili' which was serialised in 'Naradar'). His writiings are copyright of the Devan Endowments. Recently, many of Devan's works have been published by Alliance Publishers, Chennai, India. 'Kizakkup padhippagam' has also recently started publishing Devan's writings.\nOne of his novels, Justice Jagannathan, has been translated into English.\n\nHis writings include :\n\nNovels:\n\nOther collections of stories, articles and travelogues include:\n\n\n"}

A secondary, common meaning of \"diction\" means the distinctiveness of speech, the art of speaking so that each word is clearly heard and understood to its fullest complexity and extremity, and concerns pronunciation and tone, rather than word choice and style. This secondary sense is more precisely and commonly expressed with the term enunciation, or with its synonym articulation.\n\nDiction has multiple concerns, of which register is foremost—another way of saying this is whether words are either formal or informal in the social context. Literary diction analysis reveals how a passage establishes tone and characterization, e.g. a preponderance of verbs relating physical movement suggests an active character, while a preponderance of verbs relating states of mind portrays an introspective character. Diction also has an impact upon word choice and syntax.\n\nAristotle, in The Poetics (20) states that \"Diction comprises eight elements: Phoneme, Syllable, Conjunction, Connective, Noun, Verb, Inflection, and Utterance. However, Epps states that in this passage \"the text is so confused and some of the words have such a variety of meanings that one cannot always be certain what the Greek says, much less what Aristotle means.\"\n\nDiction is usually judged with reference to the prevailing standards of proper writing and speech and is seen as the mark of quality of the writing. It is also understood as the selection of certain words or phrases that become peculiar to a writer.\n\n\nForms of diction include: Archaic Diction (diction that is antique, that is rarely used), High Diction (lofty sounding language), and Low Diction (everyday language). Each of these forms are to enhance the meaning or artistry of an author's work.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39411713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39411713", "title": "Entryism", "text": "Entryism\n\nEntryism (also referred to as entrism or enterism, or as infiltration) is a political strategy in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger, organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program. In situations where the organization being \"entered\" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and subversion to hide the fact that they are an organisation in their own right.\n\nHorton (2014) gives the \"example of entryism – the infiltration of a self-proclaimed human rights activist into an institution committed to neoliberalism, a market fundamentalism that has been credited with eroding health systems in dozens of low and middle-income countries\". Leslie (1999) uses the example of gender: \"alternative, yet complementary, strategies of 'entryism', with attempts to enter and transform these institutions' gender inequalities from within (as missionaries)\".\n\n\"French Turn\" refers to the classic form of entrism advocated by Leon Trotsky in his essays on \"the French Turn\". In June 1934, he proposed that the French Trotskyists dissolve their Communist League to join the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and that it also dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements. The tactic was adopted in August 1934, despite some opposition. The turn successfully raised the group's membership to 300 activists.\n\nProponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the social democratic parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them, and steer those currents toward Leninism. However, entry lasted only for a brief period: the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists. The Trotskyists of the Workers Party of the United States also successfully used their entry into the Socialist Party of America to recruit their youth group and other members. Similar tactics were also used by Trotskyist organisations in other countries, including The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Poland. Entrism was used to connect with and recruit leftward-moving political currents inside radical parties.\n\nSince the turn in France, Marxists have used the tactic even if they had different preconceptions of how long the period of entry would last.\n\nIn these types of entrism, entrists engage in a long-term perspective in which they work within an organisation for decades in hopes of gaining influence and a degree of power and perhaps even control of the larger organisation.\n\nIn entryism \"sui generis\" (\"of a special type\"), Trotskyists, for example, do not openly argue for the building of a Trotskyist party. \"Deep entryism\" refers to the long duration.\n\nThe tactic is closely identified with Michel Pablo and Gerry Healy, who were leaders of the Fourth International in the late 1940s and 1950s. The \"deep entry\" tactic was developed as a way for Trotskyists to respond to the Cold War. In countries where there were mass social democratic or communist parties, it was as difficult to be accepted into these parties as Trotskyist currents as to build separate Trotskyist parties. Therefore, Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party.\n\nIn Europe, this was the approach used, for example, by The Club and later Socialist Action in the Labour Party, and by Fourth Internationalists inside the Communist Parties. In France, Trotskyist organizations, most notably the \"Parti des Travailleurs\" and its predecessors, have successfully entered trade unions and mainstream left-wing parties.\n\nSome political parties, such as the Workers' Party in Brazil or the Scottish Socialist Party, allow political tendencies to openly organise within them. In these cases the term entryism is not usually used. Political groups which work within a larger organisation but also maintain a \"public face\" often reject the term \"entrism\" but are nevertheless sometimes considered to be entryists by the larger organisation.\n\nIn Australia, the practice was widespread during the 1950s, where Communists battled against right-wing 'Groupers', for control of Australian trade unions. The Groupers subsequently formed the Democratic Labor Party. Today the practice in Australia is often known as a type of branch stacking.\n\nIn recent times RSPCA Australia has been described as being the victims of the practice. The National Farmers' Federation and Animals Australia have each been accused of infiltrating branches of RSPCA Australia in an attempt to promote opposing policies concerning battery hens, intensive pig farming, and the live export of sheep.\n\nSince the 2000s the religious right has been practicing entryism into a number of state branches of the Liberal Party of Australia, notably in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria.\n\nAlthough the term entryism was used little if at all, opponents accused David Orchard and his supporters of attempting to win the leadership of the former Progressive Conservative Party in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) with the intention of dramatically changing its policies.\n\nOrchard had made his name as a leading opponent of free trade, which was perhaps \"the\" singular signature policy of the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in the late 1980s and early 1990s. While opponents pointed to this remarkable distance, Orchard and his supporters argued that they represented \"traditional\" Tory values and economic nationalism that the \"older\" Conservative Party, and the Progressive Conservative party before Mulroney, had espoused, namely that of John Diefenbaker.\n\nOpponents of the 2003 merger between the Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance parties also charged Alliance members with infiltration. It was widely speculated that most, if not all of the approximately 25,000 Canadians who swelled the PC Party's membership before the merger vote were Alliance members. They would likely have voted in favour of the merger.\n\nLiberals for Life, a pro-life group allied with the Campaign Life Coalition, was accused of infiltrating the Liberal Party of Canada in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nMembers of Socialist Action, a small Trotskyist group, play a leading role in the New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus, a small faction on the left wing of that social democratic party, and advocate that their members join and engage with the NDP. This however does not fit with most definitions of entryism due to their continued existence apart and separate from the NDP in addition to their work there. Fightback, a rival Trotskyist organization, carries out a more classical form of entryism in the NDP, particularly in its youth wings, modelling itself after the British Militant tendency which practiced entryism in the Labour Party and which at its peak was the one of the most successful entryist organizations on record.\n\nAfter the fall of Social Credit in British Columbia, the British Columbia Liberal Party saw the shift of former Social Credit members into the BC Liberal party. As a result, the new membership saw the party shift much more towards the right on fiscal policy. In this way, entryism led to a complete takeover of the original party by former Social Credit members. This however isn't formal entryism as former Social Credit members did not operate their own organization within the Liberal Party.\n\nDuring the Warlord Era in China, the Chinese Communists joined the party of the Chinese Nationalists for a time (1923–1927), creating the First United Front against warlordism, but one of the Communists' ideas behind doing so was that they might eventually gain a majority in that party and shape its policies. Eventually the situation degraded, the Nationalists expelled the Communists from their party, and the Chinese Civil War began. The latter war was paused for a time (1936–1945) to allow for a Second United Front during the Chinese resistance to Japanese imperial rule. However, the civil war resumed again and remained active until 1950.\n\nThe Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands was a fake pro-China communist party in the Netherlands set up by the Dutch secret service BVD to develop contacts with the Chinese government for espionage purposes. It existed from 1968 to the early 1990s.\n\nThe country's four small Communist parties the Communist Party of New Zealand (CPNZ), Socialist Unity Party (SUP), Workers Communist League (WCL), and the Socialist Action League (SAL) have tried to influence the Labour Party, the trade unions, and various popular issues like the anti-Springbok tour protests, the Māori biculturalism, and the anti-nuclear movement. During the ANZUS diplomatic crisis 1984-85 which resulted from NZ's nuclear ship ban, the pro-Moscow SUP tried to infiltrate anti-nuclear organisations as part of a strategy of steering New Zealand's foreign policy away from its traditional ally the United States.\n\nNew Zealand's Christian Right also attempted to obtain electoral influence. During the 1987 general election, several conservative Christian groups including the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC), Women for Life and the Coalition of Concerned Citizens tried to infiltrate the National Party by running conservative Christian individuals as candidates. These groups also attacked the Labour government's policies towards peace education, sex education, abortion, Maori biculturalism, and the ANZUS alliance. Several CCC supporters contested the 1987 election as National candidates including Rob Wheeler (Mount Albert), Andrew Stanley (Onehunga), and Howard Martin (Papatoetoe). However, these efforts met little electoral success and the Lange government was re-elected for a second term.\n\nDuring the 1990s, another conservative tendency emerged within the National Party through the establishment of the informal Christian Voice group in 1998. However, it had faded by the mid-2000s when several minor Christian political parties including former National MP Graeme Lee's Christian Democrat Party, Peter Dunne's United Future, and Brian Tamaki's Destiny New Zealand emerged to court the evangelical Christian vote. As a result of these attempts at taking over the party, National quietly centralised its candidate selection procedures.\n\nDespite these tensions with moral conservatives, National Party leader Don Brash still accepted covert assistance from the Exclusive Brethren during the 2005 general elections. This assistance included organizing a separate electoral canvassing and advertising campaign which attacked the incumbent Labour and Green coalition government. This strategy backfired and contributed to Prime Minister Helen Clark's second re-election. Due to the controversy arising from the Exclusive Brethren's canvassing on behalf of National, Brash's successor Prime Minister John Key explicitly rejected any assistance from the Exclusive Brethren during the 2008 election.\n\nA long-lasting entry tactic was used by the Militant tendency (a Trotskyist group), whose initially very small number of supporters worked within the Labour Party from the 1960s. By the early-1980s, though still only numbered in the low thousands, they had managed to gain a controlling influence of the Labour Party Young Socialists and Liverpool City Council, but almost simultaneously Militant activists began to be expelled after an internal Labour ruling that their organisation breached the party's constitution. A remnant of the group now operates within the Labour Party as Socialist Appeal but the (then) majority left to form the Socialist Party (England and Wales).\n\n\"The Guardian\" columnist George Monbiot claims that a group influenced by the defunct Marxist \"Living Marxism\" magazine have pursued entryist tactics amongst scientific and media organisations in the UK, since the late 1990s.\n\nThe 2015 Labour leadership election in the United Kingdom was the target of a campaign by \"The Daily Telegraph\" for Conservative sympathisers to join the Labour party as £3 supporters in order to vote for the left wing candidate Jeremy Corbyn, with the view this would render the party un-electable. This strategy was labelled 'entryism' by observers.\n\nAnother example of charges of entryism involving the United States Reform Party involved supporters of Fred Newman and the New Alliance Party joining the Reform Party \"en masse\" and gaining some level of control over the New York State affiliate of the Reform Party. Another United States politician, Lyndon LaRouche, has attempted an entryist strategy in the Democratic Party since 1980, but with little success. Many Libertarians or libertarian-leaning politicians have run for office as Republicans, and several (such as Ron Paul, his son Rand Paul, and Mark Sanford) have been successful.\n\n\n"}

The concept first began with using foot tongs or slippers on hands to absorb the impact from kicks and strikes. Modern day punch mitts came into more widespread use in the mid-1960’s when Bruce Lee was seen using them in his training routines. Although they have been around for decades, they were never a central part of coaching until the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. Now they’ve become an almost irreplaceable part of a fighter’s routine.\n\nThe person holding the focus mitts will typically call out combinations and \"feed\" the puncher good counter-force while maneuvering and working specific skills. Focus mitts are often used as an augment to sparring, with more explicit focus on the puncher than the feeder, especially to develop good punch combinations and defensive maneuvers such as \"slipping,\" \"bobbing\" and \"weaving.\"\n\nWhen wearing focus mitts it is important not merely to hold them but to actively \"feed\" them into the punches, to balance their force and prevent injury to both parties.\n\nSimilar to a focus mitt but designed for different purposes are heavier Thai pads used in muay Thai boxing and MMA, kicking shields, body shields and uppercut shields used in a variety of martial arts to help gauge distance and practice techniques with kicks, knees, elbows and uppercuts.\n\nIt is often said that holding focus mitts can be as taxing as striking them. Typically, the person wearing the focus mitts will yell a number that represents a combination. For example, yelling \"three!\" might signify that the striker should throw a jab, followed by a cross, followed by a hook in rapid succession. Defensive maneuvers are often incorporated into the combinations as well.\n\nImproving punching technique relies upon the person wearing the focus mitts knowing where to set his/her hands, as well as knowing how to time the movement of the focus mitts. Typically the holder will comment on how the striker can improve his/her technique between combinations.\n\n"}

The ancient commentaries of Horace note that he was a follower of the teachings of Epicurus.\n\nIn the spring of 44 BC Cassius Parmensis participated in the assassination of Caesar by members of the Senate. In 43 BC, following the murder, he became a \"quaestor\" and built a fleet which supported Gaius Cassius Longinus against Publius Cornelius Dolabella off the coast of the province of Asia. At the same time he wrote a report to Cicero from Cyprus on the situation, which has been handed down in the latter's correspondence.\n\nIn November of 43 Cassius Parmensis, like many other enemies of Caesar, was declared an outlaw (proscribed) by the triumvirate of Mark Antony, Octavian, and Lepidus. After the defeat of the party of the murderers of Caesar in the Battle of Philippi (autumn of 42 BC), he gathered the remaining military units and was able to bring himself and the undamaged fleet to safety for a while with Sextus Pompeius in Sicily. After the latter's defeat in the year 36 BC, he accompanied the fallen \"naval king\" to Asia Minor, in order to join Anthony during the final battles in Bithynia.\n\nAnthony and Octavian waged a propaganda attack with in part low blows and slanders which preceded the decisive military confrontation for autocratic rule in the Roman Empire. Cassius also took part with intense violent attacks against Caesar's heirs. He asserted that Octavian was of low descent, and was only named his heir due to a homosexual relationship with Caesar. Furthermore, he said that Octavian had wanted to make his only daughter Julia the consort of the rich but \"barbarous\" nobleman Koson of Dacia.\n\nIn 31 BC, Cassius Parmensis fought under Anthony's command at the Battle of Actium. His flight from Octavian's revenge lasted a total of twelve years (which was longer than that of all the other conspirators) but after the fall of Anthony he finally lost every possibility of fleeing, since the adopted son of Caesar now ruled the entire Roman Empire. After the defeat at Actium, he fled to Athens, where, in 30 B.C. at the very latest, he was recognized as the last murderer of Caesar still living and was killed by Lucius Varus under Octavian's orders.\n\nAs an author, Cassius Parmensis wrote tragedies, satires, elegies and epigrams, which, in Horace's opinion, were not insignificant. Unfortunately, none of his work has survived. We only know the titles of two tragedies, \"Thyestes\" and \"Brutus,\" the first of which was allegedly stolen by his murderer Varus. \"Thyestes\" was subsequently published as Varus's own work. The style of his letter to Cicero seems above all complicated and pedantic in its flatteries, but also demonstrates a good talent for military observation. As for the common assertion often referring to another location in Horace, that Cassius had been burned to death together with his works, it is probably a mix-up.\n\nMarcus Terentius Varro quotes a verse of Cassius; however, the same verse is also attributed in another place to the poet Lucius Accius:\n"}

Some Greek linguists consider it to be a Modern Greek dialect and often call it \"Katoitaliótika\" (, \"Southern Italian\") or \"Grekanika\" (), whereas its own speakers call it \"Greko\" (, in Calabria) or \"Griko\" (, in Salento). Griko and Standard Modern Greek are partially mutually intelligible.\n\nThe most popular hypothesis on the origin of Griko is the one by Gerhard Rohlfs and Georgios Hatzidakis, that Griko's roots go as far back in history as the time of the ancient Greek colonies in Southern Italy and Sicily in the eighth century BC. The Southern Italian dialect is thus considered to be the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed Magna Graecia.\n\nThere are, however, competing hypotheses according to which Griko may have preserved some Doric elements, but its structure is otherwise mostly based on Koine Greek, like almost all other Modern Greek dialects. Thus, Griko should rather be described as a Doric-influenced descendant of Medieval Greek. The idea of Southern Italy's Greek dialects being historically derived from Medieval Greek was proposed for the first time in the 19th century by Giuseppe Morosi.\n\nTwo small Italiot-speaking communities survive today in the Italian regions of Calabria (Province of Reggio Calabria) and Apulia (peninsula of Salento). The Italiot-speaking area of Salento comprises nine small towns in the Grecìa Salentina region (Calimera, Martano, Castrignano de' Greci, Corigliano d'Otranto, Melpignano, Soleto, Sternatia, Zollino, Martignano), with a total of 40,000 inhabitants. The Calabrian Greek region also consists of nine villages in Bovesia, (including Bova Superiore, Roghudi, Gallicianò, Chorìo di Roghudi and Bova Marina) and four districts in the city of Reggio Calabria, but its population is significantly smaller, with around only 2000 inhabitants.\n\nBy Law 482 of 1999, the Italian parliament recognised the Griko communities of Reggio Calabria and Salento as a Greek ethnic and linguistic minority. It states that the Republic protects the language and culture of its Albanian, Catalan, Germanic, Greek, Slovene and Croat populations and of those who speak French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian.\n\nThere is rich oral tradition and Griko folklore. Griko songs, music and poetry are particularly popular in Italy and Greece. Famous music groups from Salento include Ghetonia and Aramirè. Also, influential Greek artists such as Dionysis Savvopoulos and Maria Farantouri have performed in Griko. The Greek musical ensemble Encardia focuses on Griko songs as well as on the musical tradition of Southern Italy at large.\n\nSample text from \"Καληνύφτα – Kalinifta\" (\"Good night\") and \"Andramu pai\", popular Griko songs:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1272976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1272976", "title": "Karma in Hinduism", "text": "Karma in Hinduism\n\nKarma is a concept in Puranic time/era which explains causality through a system where beneficial effects are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a soul's (Atman's) reincarnated lives forming a cycle of rebirth. The causality is said to be applicable not only to the material world but also to our thoughts, words, actions and actions that others do under our instructions.\n\nThe earliest appearance of the word \"karman\" is found in the Rigveda. The term \"karman\" also appears significantly in the Veda. According to Brahmana, \"as his wife man is born to the world he has made\" and one is placed in a balance in the other world for an estimate of one's good and evil deed. It also declares that as a man is 'constituted' by his desires, he is born in the other world with reference to these.\nScholars have generally agreed that the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, which is the earliest of the Upanisads. The doctrine occurs here in the context of a discussion of the fate of the individual after death.\n\nThe doctrine of transmigration of the soul, with respect to fateful retribution for acts committed, does not appear in the Rig Veda. The belief in rebirth is, suggests Radhakrishnan, evident in the Brahmanas, where words like \"punar-mrtyu\"(re-death), \"punar-asu\" (coming to life again) and \"punarajati\" (rebirth) are used to denote it. Radhakrishnan acknowledges that other scholars interpret certain \"punar-mrtyu\" verses of Rigveda to be discussing \"repeated deaths\"; however, he suggests that it might also be re-interpreted to imply rebirth, as in \"come home once again\".\n\nThe concept of karma first appears strongly in the Bhagavad Gita. The topic of karma is mentioned in the Puranas.\n\nThe word ‘karma’ has originated from the Sanskrit root ‘kri’ which means ‘to do’ or ‘to ‘act and react’\n\n\"Karma\" literally means \"action\" or \"reincarnation\", and more broadly names the universal principle of cause and effect, action and reaction, which Hindus believe governs all consciousness. Karma is not fate, for we act with what can be described as a conditioned free will creating our own destinies. Karma refers to the totality of our actions and their concomitant reactions in this and previous lives, all of which determine our future. The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and dispassionate reaction. Not all karmas rebound immediately. Some accumulate and return unexpectedly in this or other lifetimes. Human beings are said to produce karma in four ways:\n\nEverything that we have ever thought, spoken, done or caused is karma, as is also that which we think, speak or do this very moment. Hindu scriptures divide karma into three kinds:\n\n\nSome believe that only human beings who can distinguish right from wrong can do (kriyamana) karma. Therefore, animals and young children are considered incapable of creating new karma (and thus cannot affect their future destinies) as they are incapable of discriminating between right and wrong.\n\nTulsidas, a Hindu saint, said: \"Our destiny was shaped long before the body came into being.\" As long as the stock of \"sanchita karma\" lasts, a part of it continues to be taken out as \"prarabdha karma\" for being enjoyed in one lifetime, leading to the cycle of birth and death. A Jiva cannot attain moksha (liberation) from the cycle of birth and death, until the accumulated \"sanchita karmas\" are completely exhausted.\n\nUnkindness yields spoiled fruits, called \"paap\", and good deeds bring forth sweet fruits, called \"punya\". As one acts, so does one become: one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and evil by evil action.\n\nSeveral different views exist in Hinduism, some extant today and some historical, regarding the role of divine beings in controlling the effects of karma or the lack thereof.\n\nIn the theistic side of Vedanta,the creator Ishvara rules over the world through the law of karma.\n\nIn non-dualistic (Advaita) school of Vedanta, the creator is not the ultimate reality, \"I am God\" is the supreme truth, the pursuit of self-knowledge is spirituality, and it shares the general concepts of karma-rebirth-samsara ideas found in Buddhism with some important differences.\n\nIn a commentary to Brahma Sutras (III, 2, 38, and 41), a Vedantic text, Adi Sankara, an Indian philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta, argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities like adrsta—an unseen force being the metaphysical link between work and its result—by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being (Ishvara).\n\nA human's karmic acts result in merits and demerits. Since unconscious things generally do not move except when caused by an agent (for example, the ax moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues there must be a conscious God who knows the merits and demerits which persons have earned by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause [a \"judge and police-force\" working for \"the law\"] in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits. Thus, God affects the person's environment, even to its atoms, and for those souls who reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person might have the karmically appropriate experiences. Since a data-system (or computer) is needed to discern different \"just\" consequences for actions, there is suggested to be a sentient theistic administrator or supervisor for karma, i.e., Vishnu (King of Kings).\n\n\nSwami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.\n\nThere is a passage from Swami Sivananda's translation of the Svetasvatara Upanishad (4:6) illustrating this concept:\n\nIn his commentary, the first bird represents the individual soul, while the second represents Brahman or God. The soul is essentially a reflection of Brahman. The tree represents the body. The soul identifies itself with the body, reaps the fruits of its actions, and undergoes rebirth. The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not eat, for he is the director of both the eater and the eaten.\n\nSwami Sivananda also notes that God is free from charges of partiality and cruelty which are brought against him because of social inequality, fate, and universal suffering in the world. According to the Brahma Sutras, individual souls are responsible for their own fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the merit and demerit of souls.\n\nIn his commentary on Chapter 2 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda further notes that the position of God with respect to karma can be explained through the analogy of rain. Although rain can be said to bring about the growth of rice, barley and other plants, the differences in various species is due to the diverse potentialities lying hidden in the respective seeds. Thus, Sivananda explains that differences between classes of beings are due to different merits belonging to individual souls. He concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.\n\nRamanuja of the Vishishtadvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, addresses the problem of evil by attributing all evil things in life to the accumulation of evil karma of jivas (souls in bondage to a corporeal form) and maintains that God is \"amala,\" or without any stain of evil.\nIn Sri Bhasya, Ramanuja's interpretation of the Brahma sutras from a Vaishnavite theistic view, Brahman, whom he conceives as Vishnu, arranges the diversity of creation in accordance with the different karma of individual souls.\n\nRamanuja, reiterates that inequality and diversity in the world are due to the fruits of karma of different souls and the omnipresent energy of the soul suffers pain or pleasure due to its karma. Unlike the Semitic religions, e.g., Abrahamic religions, which believe that God created the soul and the world out of ‘nothing,’ Ramanuja believed that creation is an eternally recurring cyclic process and hence God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it. Instead he believed that karma, the result of the actions of Jivas (souls) in previous embodiments, causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of karma which have to be necessarily to be enjoyed or suffered by the Jivas themselves who are responsible for the fruits.\n\nAlthough souls alone have the freedom and responsibility for their acts and thus reap the fruits of karma, i.e., good and evil karma, God as Vishnu, is the supreme Enforcer of karma, by acting as the Sanctioner (Anumanta) and the Overseer (Upadrasta). According to Ramanuja, all jivas are burdened with their load of Karma, which gives them only enjoyments and sufferings, but also desires and tendencies to act in particular ways; although the moral responsibility accrues only to the Jiva, as he acts according to the tendencies and deserts he has acquired by his karma, Ramanuja believes that God wills only their fructification. According to the foregoing concept, God is \"compared to light which may be used for forging or for reading scriptures,\" but the merits or demerit \"devolves entirely on the persons concerned and not on the light.\"\n\nFurthermore, Ramanuja believes that Vishnu wishing to do a favour to those who are resolved on acting so as fully to please Him, engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of action altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds a delight in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles in the way of the attainment of God.\n\nMadhva, the founder of the Dvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, on the other hand, believes that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the cause of the problem of evil. Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with same type of karma from the beginning of time. Thus, Madhva concludes that the jivas (souls) are not God's creation as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with Vishnu, although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo.\n\nAccording to Madhva, God, although He has control, does not interfere with Man's free will; although He is omnipotent, that does not mean that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them freedom to follow their own nature. Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature. However, like Shankara's interpretation of the Brahma Sutras as mentioned earlier, Madhva, agrees that the rewards and punishments bestowed by God are regulated by Him in accordance with the good and sinful deeds performed by them, and He does so of out of His own will to keep himself firm in justice and he cannot be controlled in His actions by karma of human beings nor can He be accused of partiality or cruelty to anyone.\n\nSwami Tapasyananda further explains the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: the power in a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (\"jivas\") move in a direction in which they are set. Thus he concludes that no charge of partiality and cruelty can be brought against God. The jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions.\n\nMadhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs, owing to his concept of eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation (Mukti-yogyas), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration (Nitya-samsarins), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal hell or Andhatamas (Tamo-yogyas).\n\nEarlier historical traditions of Hinduism such as Mimamsakas, reject any such notions of divinity being responsible and see karma as acting independently, considering the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma.\n\nAccording to the Mimamsakas it is useless to set up a God for that purpose, since Karma itself can give the result at a future time.\n\nIn the later writings in the Nyaya, school of philosophy, Udayana's \"Nyayakusumanjali\" used Karma for the last of his nine proofs of the existence of a creative God: See Nyaya on God and Salvation.\n\nSwami Sivananda Saraswati puts it like this:\n\nSivananda concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.\n\nSambandar of the Shaiva Siddhanta school, in the 7th century C.E., writes about karma in his outline of Shaivism. He explains the concept of karma in Hinduism by distinguishing it from that of Buddhism and Jainism, which do not require the existence of an external being like God. In their beliefs, just as a calf among a large number of cows can find its mother at suckling time, so also does karma find the specific individual it needs to attach to and come to fruition. However, theistic Hindus posit that karma, unlike the calf, is an unintelligent entity. Hence, karma cannot locate the appropriate person by itself. Sambantha concludes that an intelligent Supreme Being with perfect wisdom and power (Shiva, for example) is necessary to make karma attach to the appropriate individual. In such sense, God is the Divine Accountant.\n\nAppayya Dikshita, a Shaiva theologian and proponent of Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards happiness and misery in accordance with the law of karma. Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone.\n\nSrikantha, another Saivite theologian and proponent of Siva Advaita, believes that individual souls themselves do things which may be regarded as the cause of their particular actions, or desisting from particular actions, in accordance with the nature of the fruition of their past deeds. Srikantha further believes that Siva only helps a person when he wishes to act in a particular way or to desist from a particular action. Regarding the view that karma produce their own effects directly, Srikantha holds that karma being without any intelligence cannot be expected to produce manifold effects through various births and various bodies; rather fruits of one's karma can be performed only by the will of God operating in consonance with man's free will, or as determined in later stages by man's own karma so the prints of all karma are distributed in the proper order by the grace of God Shiva. In this way, God is ultimately responsible on one hand for our actions, and on the other for enjoyment and suffering in accordance with our karmas, without any prejudice to humans' moral responsibility as expressed through free will or as determined later by our own deeds. A good summary of his view is that \"man is responsible, free to act as he wills to, for Siva only fulfills needs according to the soul's karma.\" \n\nIn Chapter 1 of 10th book of the Bhagavata Purana, Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, exhorts Kamsa to refrain from killing his wife, Devaki, the mother of Krishna, by stating that death is certain for those who are born and when the body returns to the five elements, the soul leaves the body and helplessly obtains another form in accordance with the laws of karma, citing passages from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, IV:4:3. Moreover, he adds and states that the soul materializes into an appropriate body whatever the state of the mind one remembers at the time of death; i.e., at the time of the death, the soul and its subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego, is projected into the womb of a creature, human or non-human that can provide a gross body that is most suitable for the dominant state of the mind of the particular person at the time of death; note that this passage is similar in meaning as Bhagavad Gita, VIII, verse 6 Edwin Bryant, Associate Professor of religion at Rutgers University, New Jersey provided the foregoing commentaries on the discussion of Vasudeva in the Bhagavata Purana.\n\nMany names in the Vishnu Sahasranama, the thousand names of Vishnu allude to the power of God in controlling karma. For example, the 135th name of Vishnu, Dharmadhyaksha, in the Advaita philosopher Sankara's interpretation means, \"One who directly sees the merits (Dharma) and demerits (Adharma), of beings by bestowing their due rewards on them.\" \n\nOther names of Vishnu alluding to this nature of God are Bhavanah, the 32nd name, Vidhata, the 44th name, Apramattah, the 325th name, Sthanadah, the 387th name and Srivibhavanah, the 609th name. Bhavanah, according to Sankara's interpretation, means \"One who generates the fruits of Karmas of all Jivas (souls) for them to enjoy.\" The Brahma Sutra (3.2.28) \"Phalmatah upapatteh\" speaks of the Lord's function as the bestower of the fruits of all actions of the jivas.\n\nSee above discussion of karma under the Vedanta sections of Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita) and Madhva (Dvaita) for treatment of karma under the two Vaishnavite teachers.\n\n\"\"According to their karma\", all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. \"Out of many millions of wandering living entities\", one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Krishna. By the mercy of both Krsna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\"\n\nKulashekhara Alwar, a Vaishnava devotee, says in his \"Mukundamala Stotra\": 'yad yad bhavyam bhavatu bhagavan purva-karma-anurupam'. And purva-karma or bhaagya or daiva is unseen adrsta by us, and is known only to God as Vidhaataa. God created the law of karma, and God will not violate it. God does, however, give courage and strength if asked.\n\nThe Nyaya school, one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, states that one of the proofs of the existence of God is karma; It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the individual who is the agent; there ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God. This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is the same as that of Vedanta and Vaiśeṣika Sūtra.\nThus the Nyaya school provides the moral argument for the existence of God.\n\nIn Hinduism, more particularly the Dharmaśāstras, Karma is a principle in which \"cause and effect are as inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad action leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past deeds\". Thus it is important to understand that karma does not go away, one must either reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of his past actions. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states, \"According as a man acts and according as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful. He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that person consists of desires. An as is his desire so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap\". The doctrine of karma dates from ancient times and besides the above author is mentioned in the Gautama dharma-sutra, Shatapatha Brahmana, Kathaaka-grhya-sutra, Chandogya Upanishad, Markandeya Purana and many others.\n\nThe shastras written about karma go into some detail about possible consequences of karma. There is often talk about coming back as a variety of different object when it comes to reincarnation and pasts lives. In this case, it holds true, or at least insofar as the texts state. The Kathaaka-grhya-sutra states, \"some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence; others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge\".\n\nMore extensively discussed is the consequences of karma in relation to sin. \"Karmavipaka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins. This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasutra II. 3, i.e., jati (birth as a worm or animal), ayuh (life i.e. living for a short period such as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell\".\n\nAccording to a theistic view, the effects of one's bad karma may be mitigated. Examples of how bad karma can be mitigated include following, or living virtuously; performing good deeds, such as helping others; yoga, or worshiping God in order to receive grace; and conducting pilgrimages to sacred places, such as or to get grace of God. Editors of Hinduism Today Magazine, What is Hinduism? In another example, Ganesha can unweave his devotees from their karma, simplifying and purifying their lives, but this only happens after they have established a personal relationship with Him.\n\nExamples of getting God's grace are further illustrated below.\n\nShvetashvatara Upanishad 7 and 12 aver that the doer of the deeds wanders about and obtains rebirth according to his deeds but postulates an omnipotent creator, i.e., Isvara and the doctrine of grace. Isvara is the great refuge of all and a person attains immortality when blessed by Isvara or at Isvara's pleasure.\n\nA person can be free from sorrow through the grace of Isvara. Therefore, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad postulates a supreme Being whose grace to devotees provides a way of escape from the law of karma.\nAs Adi Sankara stated in his commentary on Shvetashvatara Upanishad VI:4, \"If we dedicate all our works to Ishvara, we will not be subject to the law of karma.\" \n\nTheistic schools believe in cycles of creations where souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. For example, Kaushitaki Upanishad 1.2 asserts that birth in different forms of existence as a worm, insect, fish, bird, lion, boar, snake or a human, is determined by a person's deeds and knowledge.\n\nChandogya Upanishad 5.10.7 distinguishes between good birth such as birth in a spiritual family, i.e., (brahmin caste) or an evil birth, such as birth as a dog or hog.) Thus, the doctrine of karma comes to explain why different life forms manifest, into widely various levels of biological development such as characterization into different species from plants to various types of animals, and to even differences between members of the same species, such as humans.\n\nSwami Nikilananda comments: As the rivers, following their different courses, ultimately merge in the ocean and give up their names and forms, so the devotees, losing their names and forms, become one with the Supreme Reality.\n\nCharles Keyes, professor emeritus at the University of Washington and E. Valentine Daniel, professor of anthropology at Columbia University state that many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the \"fruit of karma.\" \n\nThe Navagraha, planetary deities, including Shani (Saturn), are considered subordinate to Ishvara (i.e., the Supreme Being) and are believed by many to assist in the administration of justice. Thus, these planets can influence earthly life.\n\nSuch planetary influences are believed by many to be measurable using astrological methods including Jyotiṣa, the Hindu system of astrology.\n\nBesides narrow meaning of karma as the reaction or suffering being due to karma of their past lives and that one would have to transmigrate to another body in their next life, it is often used in the broader sense as action or reaction.\n\nThus, karma in Hinduism may mean an activity, an action or a materialistic activity. Often with the specific combination it takes specific meanings, such as \"karma-yoga\" or \"karma-kanda\" means \"yoga or actions\" and \"path of materialistic activity\" respectively. Yet another example is Nitya karma, which describes rituals which have to be performed daily by Hindus, such as the Sandhyavandanam which involves chanting of the Gayatri Mantra.\n\nOther uses include such expressions such as \"ugra-karma\", meaning bitter, unwholesome labor.\n\nIt has also been argued that Karma has a role in Hindu society as a whole. When one abides by their caste duty good Karma is earned and vice versa; and the Karma one collects is reflected in the next life as movement within the Caste system. The promise of upward mobility appealed to people, and was made plausible through Karma. This effectively \"tamed\" the lower castes into passive acceptance of the status quo. Thus, the Karma doctrine discouraged actual social mobility.\n\n\n"}

Zamenhof and sometimes as the pseudonymous Dr. Esperanto, was a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist and the creator of Esperanto, the most successful constructed language in the world. He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war and believed that this could happen with the help of a new international auxiliary language, which he first developed in 1873 while still in school.\n\nZamenhof was born on 15 December (3 December OS) 1859, the son of Markus Zamenhof (27 January 1837 - 29 November 1907) and Rozalia Zamenhof (1839 - 1 September 1892), in the multi-ethnic city of Białystok, now in Poland, at that time in Grodno Governorate in the Russian Empire as a result of the 1807 Treaties of Tilsit. His parents were of Litvak Jewish descent that inhabited the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He appears to have been natively bilingual in Yiddish and Russian. From his father, a teacher of German and French, he learned those languages and Hebrew as well. Despite this he spoke Polish, one of the major languages of Białystok alongside Yiddish, Belarusian, and German, and it was Polish that was to become the native language of his children after settling in Warsaw. In school he studied the classical languages: Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. He later learned some English, though in his own words not very well, had an interest in Lithuanian and Italian, and learned Volapük when it came out in 1880, though by that point his international language project was already well developed.\n\nIn addition to the Yiddish-speaking Jewish majority, the population of Białystok was made up of Roman Catholic Poles and Eastern Orthodox Russians (mainly government officials), with smaller groups of Belarusians,\nGermans and other ethnic groups. Zamenhof was saddened and frustrated by the many quarrels among these groups. He supposed that the main reason for the hate and prejudice lay in the mutual misunderstanding caused by the lack of one common language. If such a language existed, Zamenhof postulated, it could play the role of a neutral communication tool between people of different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.\n\nAs a student at secondary school in Warsaw, Zamenhof made attempts to create some kind of international language with a grammar that was very rich, but also very complex. When he later studied English, he decided that the international language must have a simpler grammar. Apart from his parents' native languages Russian and Yiddish and his adopted language Polish, his linguistics attempts were also aided by his mastering of German, a good passive understanding of Latin, Hebrew and French, and a basic knowledge of Greek, English and Italian.\n\nBy 1878, his project \"Lingwe uniwersala\" was almost finished. However, Zamenhof was too young then to publish his work. Soon after graduation from school he began to study medicine, first in Moscow, and later in Warsaw. In 1885, Zamenhof graduated from a university and began his practice as a doctor in Veisiejai and after 1886 as an ophthalmologist in Płock and Vienna. While healing people there he continued to work on his project of an international language.\n\nFor two years he tried to raise funds to publish a booklet describing the language until he received the financial help from his future wife's father. In 1887, the book titled \"Международный язык. Предисловие и полный учебник\" (International language: Introduction and complete textbook) was published in Russian under the pseudonym \"Doktoro Esperanto\" (Doctor Hopeful). Zamenhof initially called his language \"Lingvo internacia\" (international language), but those who learned it began to call it \"Esperanto\" after his pseudonym, and this soon became the official name for the language. For Zamenhof this language, far from being merely a communication tool, was a way of promoting the peaceful coexistence of different people and cultures.\n\nIn 1879 Zamenhof wrote the first grammar of the Yiddish language, which he published in part years later in the Yiddish magazine \"Lebn un visnshaft\". The complete original Russian text of this manuscript was only published in 1982, with parallel Esperanto translation by Adolf Holzhaus, in \"L. Zamenhof, provo de gramatiko de novjuda lingvo\" [An attempt at a grammar of neo-Jewish language], Helsinki, pp. 9–36. In this work, not only does he provide a review of Yiddish grammar, but also proposes its transition to the Latin script and other orthographic innovations. In the same period Zamenhof wrote some other works in Yiddish, including perhaps the first survey of Yiddish poetics (see p. 50 in the above-cited book).\n\nIn 1882 a wave of pogroms within the Russian Empire, including Congress Poland, motivated Zamenhof to take part in the early Zionist movement, the Hibbat Zion. He left the movement in 1887, and in 1901 published a statement in Russian with the title \"Hillelism\", in which he argued that the Zionist project could not solve the problems of the Jewish people.\n\nIn 1914 he declined an invitation to join a new organization of Jewish Esperantists, the TEHA. In his letter to the organizers, he said, \"I am profoundly convinced that every nationalism offers humanity only the greatest unhappiness ... It is true that the nationalism of oppressed peoples – as a natural self-defensive reaction – is much more excusable than the nationalism of peoples who oppress; but, if the nationalism of the strong is ignoble, the nationalism of the weak is imprudent; both give birth to and support each other ...\" Among the many works of Zamenhof translated into Esperanto is the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament.\n\nZamenhof died in Warsaw on 14 April 1917, possibly of heart failure, and was buried at the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery. The farewell speech was delivered by the chief rabbi and preacher of the Great Synagogue in Warsaw, Samuel Abraham Poznański, who said: \"There will be a time where the Polish soil and nation will understand what fame gave this great son of God to his homeland.\"\n\nBesides his linguistic work, Zamenhof published a religious philosophy he called \"Homaranismo\" (the term in Esperanto, usually rendered as \"humanitism\" in English, sometimes rendered loosely as humanitarianism or humanism), based on the principles and teachings of Hillel the Elder. He said of Homaranismo: \"It is indeed the object of my whole life. I would give up everything for it.\"\n\nZamenhof came from and lived a very-much multilingual life. His name is/was variously translitterated, depending on the language:\n\nAt his birth Zamenhof was given the Hebrew name \"Eliezer\" by his parents, the equivalent of the Latinized \"Lazarus\". However Zamenhof was born under Russian domination, and so his birth certificate records his name as \"Leyzer Zamengov\", using the Yiddish form of the forename and a russified version of his surname; many later Russian language documents also include the patronymic \"Markovich\", as is the custom in the language. His family name is of German origin and was originally written \"Samenhof\"; the spelling Zamenhof reflects the romanization of the Yiddish spelling , as well as the Esperanto and Polish spellings.\n\nIn his adolescence he used both the Yiddish \"Leyzer\" and the Russian \"Lazar\".\n\nWhile at university, Zamenhof began using the Russian name \"Lyudovik\" (also transcribed \"Ludovic\" or translated as \"Ludwig\") in place of \"Lazar\", possibly in honor of Francis Lodwick, who in 1652 had published an early conlang proposal. When his brother Leon became a doctor and started signing his name \"Dr L. Zamenhof\", Zamenhof reclaimed his birth name \"Lazar\" and from 1901 signed his name \"Dr L. L. Zamenhof\" to avoid confusion with his brother. The two L's do not seem to have specifically represented either name, and the order \"Ludwik Lazar\" is a modern convention.\n\nIn 1905 Zamenhof received the Légion d'honneur for creating Esperanto. In 1910, Zamenhof was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, by four British members of parliament (including James O'Grady, Philip Snowden) and Professor Stanley Lane Poole. (The Prize was instead awarded to the International Peace Bureau.) On the occasion of the 5th Universala Kongreso de Esperanto in Barcelona, Zamenhof was made a Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic by King Alfonso XIII of Spain.\n\nThe minor planet 1462 Zamenhof is named in his honor. It was discovered on 6 February 1938, by Yrjö Väisälä. Also, hundreds of city streets, parks, and bridges worldwide have been named after Zamenhof. In Lithuania, the best-known Zamenhof Street is in Kaunas, where he lived and owned a house for some time. There are others in Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Spain (mostly in Catalonia), Italy, Israel, Belgium and Brazil. There are Zamenhof Hills in Hungary and Brazil, and a Zamenhof Island in the Danube.\n\nIn some Israeli cities, street signs identify Esperanto's creator and give his birth and death dates, but refer to him solely by his Jewish name Eliezer (a variant of which, El'azar, is the origin of Lazarus). Zamenhof is honored as a deity by the Japanese religion Oomoto, which encourages the use of Esperanto among its followers. Also, a genus of lichen has been named \"Zamenhofia\" in his honour.\n\nIn 1959, Unesco honoured Zamenhof in the occasion of his centenary. In 2015 Unesco decided to support the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the death of Ludwik Zamenhof.\n\nZamenhof was 12 times nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHis birthday, 15 December, is celebrated annually as Zamenhof Day by users of Esperanto. On 15 December 2009, Esperanto's green-starred flag flew on the Google search web page, in a commemorative Google Doodle to mark Zamenhof's 150th birthday.\n\nThe house of the Zamenhof family, dedicated to Ludwik Zamenhof, and the Białystok Esperanto Centre, are sites of the Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok, which was opened in June 2008 by volunteers at The University of Białystok Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "140914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140914", "title": "Lao language", "text": "Lao language\n\nLao, sometimes referred to as Laotian ( 'Lao' or ພາສາລາວ 'Lao language') is a tonal language of the Kra–Dai language family. It is the official language of Laos, and it is also spoken in northeast Thailand, where it is usually referred to as the Isan language. A language of the ethnic Lao people, Lao serves as a \"lingua franca\" among all citizens of Laos. Approximately 90 different languages are spoken within its borders, many of which are unrelated to Lao. Modern Lao (language) is heavily influenced by the Thai language. A vast number of technical terms as well as common usage are adopted directly from Thai. \n\nLike other Tai languages, Lao has a complex orthography and system of relational markers. Spoken Lao is mutually intelligible with Thai and Isan, fellow Southwestern Tai languages, to a significantly high degree where its speakers are able to effectively communicate each speaking their respective language. These languages are written with slightly different scripts but are linguistically similar and effectively form a dialect continuum.\n\nLao is written with the Lao script, a traditional abugida. Although there is no official standard, the Vientiane dialect has become the de facto standard in the second half of 20th century.\n\nThe Lao language is descended from Tai languages spoken in what is now southern China and northern Vietnam in areas believed to be the homeland of the language family and where several related languages are still spoken by scattered minority groups. \n\nDue to Han Chinese expansion, Mongol invasion pressures, and a search for lands more suitable for wet rice cultivation, the Tai peoples moved south towards India, down the Mekong River valley, and as far south as the Malay Peninsula. The oral history of the migrations is preserved in the legends of Khun Borom. Tai speakers in what is now Laos pushed out or absorbed earlier groups of Austroasiatic and Austronesian languages.\n\nIn addition to the dialects of Lao, numerous closely related languages (or dialects, depending on the classification) are spoken throughout the Lao-speaking areas of Laos and Thailand, such as the Nyaw people, Phu Thai, Saek, Lao Wiang, Tai Dam, and Tai Daeng. These Tai peoples are classified by the Lao government as Lao Loum (, láo lūm) or \"lowland Lao\". Lao and Thai are also very similar and share most of their basic vocabulary, but differences in many basic words limit inter-comprehension.\n\nThe Lao language consists primarily of native Lao words. Because of Buddhism, however, Pali has contributed numerous terms, especially relating to religion and in conversation with members of the sangha. Due to their proximity, Lao has influenced the Khmer and Thai languages and vice versa.\n\nFormal writing has a larger number of loanwords, especially Pali and Sanskrit, much as Latin and Greek have influenced European languages. For politeness, pronouns (and more formal pronouns) are used, plus ending statements with (dǣ ) or (dœ̄ ). Negative statements are made more polite by ending with (dǭk ). The following are formal register examples.\n\nMany consonants in Lao make a phonemic contrast between labialized and plain versions. The complete inventory of Lao consonants is as shown in the table below:\n\nAll plosive sounds are unreleased in final position. Hence, final , , and sounds are pronounced as , , and respectively.\n\nAll vowels make a phonemic length distinction. Diphthongs are all centering diphthongs with falling sonority. The monophthongs and diphthongs are as shown in the following table:\n\nLao has six lexical tones.\n\nThere are six phonemic tones in unchecked syllables, that is, in syllables ending in a vowel or other sonorant sound ( and ).\n\nThe number of contrastive tones is reduced to four in checked syllables, that is, in syllables ending in an obstruent sound ( or the \nglottal stop ).\n\nLao syllables are of the form (C)V(C), i.e., they consist of a vowel in the syllable nucleus, optionally preceded by a single consonant in the syllable onset and optionally followed by single consonant in the syllable coda. The only consonant clusters allowed are syllable initial clusters . Any consonant may appear in the onset, but the labialized consonants do not occur before rounded vowels.\n\nOne difference between Thai and Lao is that in Lao initial clusters are simplified. For example, the official name of Laos is Romanized as \"Sathalanalat Paxathipatai Paxaxon Lao\", with the Thai analogue being \"Satharanarat Prachathipatai Prachachon Lao\" (สาธารณรัฐประชาธิปไตยประชาชนลาว), indicating the simplification of Thai \"pr\" to Lao \"p\".\n\nOnly may appear in the coda. If the vowel in the nucleus is short, it must be followed by a consonant in the coda; in the coda can be preceded only by a short vowel. Open syllables (i.e., those with no coda consonant) and syllables ending in one of the sonorants take one of the six tones, syllables ending in take one of four tones, and syllables ending in take one of only two tones.\n\nThe majority of Lao words are monosyllabic, and are not inflected to reflect declension or verbal tense, making Lao an analytic language. Special particle words serve the purpose of prepositions and verb tenses in lieu of conjugations and declensions. Lao is a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, although the subject is often dropped. In contrast to Thai, Lao uses pronouns more frequently.\n\nThe Lao religious script is written in the Tai Tham script and based on the Old Mon script and still used in temples in Laos and Isan. The Lao alphabet, derived locally around the 14th century from the Khmer alphabet of the Khmer Empire, is ultimately rooted in the Pallava script of South India, one of the Brahmi scripts. Although similar to one another, the Lao alphabet is more phonetic than the Thai alphabet due to various Lao royal decrees concerning orthographic reforms, resulting in the Lao script having fewer duplicate sounds thus making the Lao script more phonetic, efficient and easy to learn.\n\nWords are spelt according to phonetic principles as opposed to etymological principles. In addition to consonants having tone classes, tone marks facilitate marking tones where they are needed. Romanization of Lao is inconsistent, but is based on French transcriptive methods.\n\nNumerals may be written out as words (1 vs. \"one\"), but numerical symbols are more common. Although Arabic numerals are most common, Lao numerals (of Brahmi origin) are also taught and employed.\n\nLao is traditionally not written with spaces between words, although signs of change are multiplying. Spaces are reserved for ends of clauses or sentences. Periods are not used, and questions can be determined by question words in a sentence. Traditional punctuation marks include ໌, an obsolete mark indicating silenced consonants; ໆ, used to indicate repetition of the preceding word; ຯ, the Lao ellipsis that is also used to indicate omission of words; ฯ, a more or less obsolete symbol indicating shortened form of a phrase (such as royal names); and ฯລฯ, used to indicate \"et cetera\".\n\nIn more contemporary writing, punctuation marks are borrowed from French, such as exclamation point !, question mark ?, parentheses (), and «» for quotation marks, although \"\" is also common. Hyphens (-) and the ellipsis (...) are also commonly found in modern writing.\n\nExperts disagree on the number and nature of tones in the various dialects of Lao. According to some, most dialects of Lao and Isan have six tones, those of Luang Prabang have five. Tones are determined as follows:\n\nA silent () placed before certain consonants will produce place the other proceeding consonant in the high class. This can occur before the letters , , , and and combined in special ligatures (considered separate letters) such as , , and . In addition to (low tone) and (falling tone), there also exists the rare (high) (rising) tone marks.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5077931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5077931", "title": "Least publishable unit", "text": "Least publishable unit\n\nIn academic publishing, the least publishable unit (LPU), also smallest publishable unit (SPU), minimum publishable unit (MPU), loot, or publon, is the smallest measurable quantum of publication, the minimum amount of information that can be used to generate a publication in a peer-reviewed venue, such as a journal or a conference. (Maximum publishable unit and optimum publishable unit are also used.) The term is often used as a joking, ironic, or derogatory reference to the strategy of artificially inflating quantity of publications.\n\nPublication of the results of research is an essential part of science. The number of publications is often used to assess the work of a scientist and as a basis for distributing research funds. In order to achieve a high rank in such an assessment, there is a trend to split up research results into smaller parts that are published separately, thus inflating the number of publications. This process has been described as splitting the results into the smallest publishable units. \n\n\"Salami publication\", sometimes also referred to as \"salami slicing\", is a variant of the smallest-publishable-unit strategy. In salami publishing, data gathered by one research project is separately reported (wholly or in part) in multiple end publications. Salami publishing, apparently named by analogy with the thin slices made from a larger salami sausage, is generally considered questionable when not explicitly labeled, as it may lead to the same data being counted multiple times as apparently independent results in aggregate studies.\n\nWhen data gathered in one research project are partially reported as if a single study, a problem of statistical significance can arise. Scientists typically use a 5% threshold (0.95 probability) to determine whether a hypothesis is supported by the results of a research project. If multiple hypotheses are being tested on a single research project, 1 in 20 hypotheses will by chance be supported by the research. Partially reported research projects must use a more stringent threshold when testing for statistical significance but often do not do this.\n\nThere is no consensus among academics about whether people should seek to make their publications least publishable units, and it has long been resisted by some journal editors. Particularly for people just getting started in academic publication, writing a few small papers provides a way of getting used to how the system of peer review and professional publication works, and it does indeed help to boost publication count. But publishing too many LPUs is thought not to impress peers when it comes time to seek promotion beyond the assistant professor (or equivalent) level. Also, LPUs may not always be the most efficient way to pass on knowledge, because they break up ideas into small pieces, sometimes forcing people to look up many cross-references. Multiple salami slices also occupy more journal pages than a single synthetic paper that contains the same information. On the other hand, a small piece of information is easily digestible, and the reader may not need more information than what is in the LPU.\n\n\n"}

These pictures are \"designed to offer readers a high-utility message in a minimum amount of space.\" (Beers, 129) Some languages, for example, many East Asian languages, such as Chinese varieties (e.g. Mandarin, Cantonese, Min, and Wu), and partially Korean and Japanese, are written in logographic scripts; single glyphs represent whole morphemes.\n\nExamples of logographic cues include traffic signs, restroom signs, and pictorial flashcards. Unsurprisingly, logographic cues tend to be processed in the right brain hemisphere, the side more actively engaged with visuospatial input. Due to advances in technology and the media where logographic cues such as brand logos abound, the ability and tendency to draw meaning from pictures has become more widespread and intuitive.\n\nLogographic cues have also become increasingly useful in the domain of education, specifically in the development of reading skills. Many sources of educational advice suggest the use of logographic cues to tap into visual learning and intelligence, which usually takes a subordinate role to verbal education in schools; such sources include literacy expert Kylene Beers and a nationwide reading program, All America Reads.\n\nSpecific activities that utilize logographic cues include: students making symbols within the margins of print text and worksheets that provide a pictorial summary of the information given and picture flash cards that foster vocabulary development. (Kajder, 43) Teaching methods employing logographic cues can help to encourage and increase word recognition, text reformulation and information organization. The method also helps to tap into the sensory stimulation that encodes information into long-term memory.\n\nThe use of this method has also received some criticism. In reference to the use of logographic cues to develop word recognition the \"International Journal of Disability, Development and Education\" writes that “the results of controlled studies show it to be ineffective and potentially detrimental to student learning.” (Sheehy, 47) The particular study documented in this journal suggested similar but modified alternatives such as Integrated Picture Cueing or the Handle Technique. The Integrated Picture Cueing (IPC) technique makes pictures out of the desired words, themselves, rather than symbolic pictorial depictions. The Handle Technique depicts the word with an extra serif (handle) that helps students encode the word and its meaning. Despite these findings and alternatives, logographic cues are widely used and encouraged in education.\n\n"}

{"id": "31845565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31845565", "title": "Modern Hebrew grammar", "text": "Modern Hebrew grammar\n\nModern Hebrew grammar is partly analytic, expressing such forms as dative, ablative, and accusative using prepositional particles rather than morphological cases.\n\nOn the other hand, Modern Hebrew grammar is also fusional synthetic: inflection plays a role in the formation of verbs and nouns (using non-concatenative discontinuous morphemes realised by vowel infixation) and the declension of prepositions (i.e. with pronominal suffixes). For example, whereas the ancient Hebrew phrase for \"my grandfather\" was \"sav-í\" \"grandfather-1stPerson.Singular.Possessive\", in Israeli Hebrew it is \"sába shelí\" \"grandfather of-me\".\n\nExamples of Hebrew are represented using the (IPA) as well as native script. Although most speakers collapse the phonemes into , the distinction is maintained by a limited number of speakers and will therefore be indicated here for maximum coverage. In the transcriptions, is used for the rhotic, which is more commonly a lax voiced uvular approximant .\n\nEvery Hebrew sentence must contain at least one subject, at least one predicate, usually but not always a verb, and possibly other arguments and complements.\n\nWord order in Modern Hebrew is somewhat similar to that in English: as opposed to Biblical Hebrew, where the word order is Verb-Subject-Object, the usual word order in Modern Hebrew is Subject-Verb-Object. Thus, if there is no case marking, one can resort to the word order. Modern Hebrew is characterized by an asymmetry between definite Objects and indefinite Objects. There is an accusative marker, \"et\", only before a definite Object (mostly a definite noun or personal name). \"Et-ha\" is currently undergoing fusion and reduction to become \"ta\". Consider \"ten li et ha-séfer\" \"give:2ndPerson.Masculine.Singular.Imperative to-me ACCUSATIVE the-book\" (i.e. \"Give me the book\"), where \"et\", albeit syntactically a case-marker, is a preposition and \"ha\" is a definite article. This sentence is realised phonetically as \"ten li ta-séfer\".\n\nIn sentences where the predicate is a verb, the word order is usually subject–verb–object (SVO), as in English. However, word order can change in the following instances:\n\n\nGenerally, Hebrew marks every noun in a sentence with some sort of preposition, with the exception of subjects and semantically indefinite direct objects. Unlike English, indirect objects require prepositions (Hebrew \"הוּא נָתַן לִי אֶת הַכַּדּוּר\" /hu naˈtan li ʔet ha-kaˈdur/ (literally \"he gave to-me direct-object-marker the ball) in contrast to English \"He gave me the ball\") and semantically definite direct objects are introduced by the preposition את (Hebrew \"הוּא נָתַן לִי אֶת הַכַּדּוּר\" /hu naˈtan li ʔet ha-kaˈdur/ (literally \"he gave to-me direct-object-marker the ball) in contrast to English \"He gave me the ball\").\n\nHebrew also produces sentences where the predicate is not a finite verb. A sentence of this type is called משפט שמני , a nominal sentence. These sentences contain a subject, a non-verbal predicate, and an optional copula. Types of copulae include:\n\nWhile לֹא (\"not\") precedes the copula in the past and future tenses, it follows the copula (a subject pronoun) in the present tense.\n\n\n\nSentences are generally divided into three types:\n\nA simple sentence is a sentence that contains one subject, one verb, and optional objects. As the name implies, it is the simplest type of sentence.\n\nTwo or more sentences that do not share common parts and can be separated by comma are called מִשְפָּט מְחֻבָּר /miʃˈpat meħuˈbar/, a compound sentence. In many cases, the second sentence uses a pronoun that stands for the other's subject; they are generally interconnected. The two sentences are linked with a coordinating conjunction (מִלַּת חִבּוּר ). The conjunction is a stand-alone word that serves as a connection between both parts of the sentence, belonging to neither part.\n\n\nLike English, Hebrew allows clauses, פְּסוּקִיּוֹת (sing. פְּסוּקִית ), to serve as parts of a sentence. A sentence containing a subordinate clause is called משפט מרכב , or a complex sentence. Subordinate clauses almost always begin with the subordinating conjunction -ש (usually \"that\"), which attaches as a prefix to the word that follows it. For example, in the sentence יוֹסִי אוֹמֵר שֶׁהוּא אוֹכֵל (\"Yossi says that he is eating\"), the subordinate clause שֶׁהוּא אוֹכֵל (\"that he is eating\") serves as the direct object of the verb אוֹמֵר (\"says\"). Unlike English, Hebrew does not have a large number of subordinating conjunctions; rather, subordinate clauses almost always act as nouns and can be introduced by prepositions in order to serve as adverbs. For example, the English As I said, there's nothing we can do\" in Hebrew is כְּפִי שֶׁאָמַרְתִּי, אֵין מָה לַעֲשׂוֹת (literally As that-I-said, there-isn't what to-do\").\n\nThat said, relative clauses, which act as adjectives, are also formed using -ֶׁש . For example, English \"Yosi sees the man who is eating apples\" is in Hebrew יוֹסִי רוֹאֶה אֶת הָאִישׁ שֶׁאוֹכֵל תַּפּוּחִים (literally \"Yosi sees [et] the-man that-eats apples\"). In this use ש sometimes acts as a relativizer rather than as a relative pronoun; that is, sometimes the pronoun remains behind in the clause: הִיא מַכִּירָה אֶת הָאִישׁ שֶׁדִּבַּרְתִּי עָלָיו , which translates to \"She knows the man I talked about\", literally means \"She knows [et] the-man that-I-talked about him\". This is because in Hebrew, a preposition (in this case על ) cannot appear without its object, so the \"him\" יו- () could not be dropped. However, some sentences, such as the above example, can be written both with relativizers and with relative pronouns. The sentence can also be rearranged into הִיא מַכִּירָה אֶת הָאִישׁ עָלָיו דִבַּרְתִּי , literally \"She knows [et] the-man about him I-talked.\", and translates into the same meaning. In that example, the preposition and its object עָלָיו also act as a relative pronoun, without use of -ֶׁש .\n\nA sentence may lack a determinate subject, then it is called מִשְפָּט סְתָמִי , an indefinite or impersonal sentence. These are used in order to put emphasis on the action, and not on the agent of the action. Usually the verb is of the 3rd person plural form.\n\n\nWhen a sentence contains multiple parts of the same grammatical function and relate to the same part of the sentence, they are called collective parts. They are usually separated with the preposition וְ- (\"and\"), and if there are more than two, they are separated with commas while the last pair with the preposition, as in English. Collective parts can have any grammatical function in the sentence, for instance:\n\n\nWhen a collective part is preceded by a preposition, the preposition must be copied onto all parts of the collective.\n\nThe Hebrew verb (פועל ) serves essentially the same functions as the English verb, but is constructed very differently. Hebrew verbs have much more internal structure. Every Hebrew verb is formed by casting a three- or four-consonant root (שֹׁרֶשׁ ) into one of seven derived stems called (בִּנְיָנִים, meaning \"buildings\" or \"constructions\"; the singular is בִּנְיָן , written henceforth as \"binyan\"). Most roots can be cast into more than one binyan, meaning more than one verb can be formed from a typical root. When this is the case, the different verbs are usually related in meaning, typically differing in voice, valency, semantic intensity, aspect, or a combination of these features. The \"concept\" of the Hebrew verb's meaning is defined by the identity of the triliteral root. The \"concept\" of the Hebrew verb assumes verbal meaning by taking on vowel-structure as dictated by the binyan's rules.\n\nEach binyan has a certain pattern of conjugation and verbs in the same binyan are conjugated similarly. Conjugation patterns within a binyan alter somewhat depending on certain phonological qualities of the verb's root; the alterations (called גִּזְרָה , meaning \"form\") are defined by the presence of certain letters composing the root. For example, three-letter roots (\"triliterals\") whose second letter is ו or י are so-called \"hollow\" or \"weak\" roots, losing their second letter in binyan , in , and in much of . The feature of being conjugated differently because the second root-letter is ו or י is an example of a gizra. It is important to note that these verbs are not strictly irregular verbs, because all Hebrew verbs that possess the same feature of the gizra are conjugated in accordance with the gizra's particular set of rules.\n\nEvery verb has a past tense, a present tense, and a future tense, with the present tense doubling as a present participle. Other forms also exist for certain verbs: verbs in five of the binyanim have an imperative mood and an infinitive, verbs in four of the binyanim have gerunds, and verbs in one of the binyanim have a past participle. Finally, a very small number of fixed expressions include verbs in the jussive mood, which is essentially an extension of the imperative into the third person. Except for the infinitive and gerund, these forms are conjugated to reflect the number (singular or plural), person (first, second, or third) and gender (masculine or feminine) of its subject, depending on the form. Modern Hebrew also has an analytic conditional~past-habitual mood expressed with the auxiliary haya.\n\nIn listings such as dictionaries, Hebrew verbs are sorted by their third-person masculine singular past tense form. This differs from English verbs, which are identified by their infinitives. (Nonetheless, the Hebrew term for \"infinitive\" is \"shem poʕal\", which means \"verb name\".) Further, each of the seven binyanim is identified by the third-person masculine singular past tense form of the root פ-ע-ל (\"P-ʕ-L\", meaning \"doing\", \"action\", etc.) cast into that binyan: , , , , , , and .\n\nBinyan \"paʕal\", also called binyan קַל or qal (\"light\"), is the most common binyan. \"Paʕal\" verbs are in the active voice, and can be either transitive or intransitive. This means that they may or may not take direct objects. \"Paʕal\" verbs are never formed from four-letter roots.\n\nBinyan \"paʕal\" is the only binyan in which a given root can have both an active and a passive participle. For example, רָצוּי (\"desirable\") is the passive participle of רָצָה (\"want\").\n\nBinyan \"paʕal\" has the most diverse number of gzarot (pl. of gizra), and the small number of Hebrew verbs that are strictly irregular (about six to ten) are generally considered to be part of the pa'al binyan, as they have some conjugation features similar to paʕal.\n\nVerbs in binyan \"nifal\" are always intransitive, but beyond that there is little restriction on their range of meanings.\n\nThe \"nifal\" is the passive-voice counterpart of \"paal\". In principle, any transitive \"paal\" verb can be rendered passive by taking its root and casting it into \"nifal\". Nonetheless, this is not \"nifʕal\"'s main use, as the passive voice is fairly rare in ordinary Modern Hebrew.\n\nMore commonly, it is \"paal\"'s middle- or reflexive-voice counterpart. Ergative verbs in English often translate into Hebrew as a \"paal\"–\"nifal\" pair. For example, English \"he broke the plate\" corresponds to Hebrew הוּא שָׁבַר אֶת הַצַּלַּחַת , using \"paa'al\"; but English \"the plate broke corresponds to Hebrew הַצַּלַּחַת נִשְׁבְּרָה , using \"nifal\". The difference is that in the first case, there is an agent doing the breaking (active), while in the second case, the agent is ignored (although the object is acted upon; passive). (Nonetheless, as in English, it can still be made clear that there was an ultimate agent: הוּא הִפִּיל אֶת הַצַּלַּחַת וְהִיא נִשְׁבְּרָה , \"he dropped the plate and it broke, uses \"nif'al\".) Other examples of this kind include פָּתַח /נִפְתַּח (\"to open\", transitive/intransitive) and גָּמַר /נִגְמַר (\"to end\", transitive/intransitive).\n\nOther relationships between a \"paa'al\" verb and its \"nifa'al\" counterpart can exist as well. One example is זָכַר and נִזְכַּר : both mean \"to remember\", but the latter implies that one had previously forgotten, rather like English \"to suddenly remember\". Another is פָּגַשׁ and נִפְגַּשׁ : both mean \"to meet\", but the latter implies an intentional meeting, while the former often means an accidental meeting.\n\nFinally, sometimes a \"nifal\" verb has no \"pa'al\" counterpart, or at least is much more common than its \"paʕal\" counterpart; נִדְבַּק (\"to stick\", intransitive) is a fairly common verb, but דָּבַק (\"to cling\") is all but non-existent by comparison. (Indeed, נִדְבַּק 's transitive counterpart is הִדְבִּיק , of binyan \"hifʕil\"; see below.)\n\nLike \"pa'al\" verbs, \"nifal\" verbs are never formed from four-letter roots.\n\n\"Nifal\" verbs, unlike verbs in the other passive binyanim (\"pua'al\" and \"hufa'al\", described below), do have gerunds, infinitives and imperatives.\n\nBinyan \"pi'el\", like binyan \"pa'al\", consists of transitive and intransitive verbs in the active voice, though there is perhaps a greater tendency for \"piʕel\" verbs to be transitive.\n\nMost roots with a \"pa'al\" verb do not have a \"piʕel\" verb, and vice versa, but even so, there are many roots that do have both. Sometimes the \"pi'el\" verb is a more intense version of the \"paʕal\" verb; for example, קִפֵּץ (\"to spring\") is a more intense version of קָפַץ (\"to jump\"), and שִׁבֵּר (\"to smash\", \"to shatter\", transitive) is a more intense version of שָׁבַר (\"to break\", transitive). In other cases, a \"piʕel\" verb acts as a causative counterpart to the \"pa'al\" verb with the same root; for example, לִמֵּד (\"to teach\") is essentially the causative of לָמַד (\"to learn\"). And in yet other cases, the nature of the relationship is less obvious; for example, סִפֵּר means \"to tell\" / \"to narrate\" or \"to cut hair\", while סָפַר means \"to count\", and פִּתֵּחַ means \"to develop\" (transitive verb), while פָּתַח means \"to open\" (transitive verb).\n\nBinyan \"puʕal\" is the passive-voice counterpart of binyan \"piʕel\". Unlike binyan \"nifʕal\", it is used \"only\" for the passive voice. It is therefore not very commonly used in ordinary speech, except that the present participles of a number of \"puʕal\" verbs are used as ordinary adjectives: מְבֻלְבָּל means \"mixed-up\" (from בֻּלְבַּל , the passive of בִּלְבֵּל , \"to confuse\"), מְעֻנְיָן means \"interested\", מְפֻרְסָם means \"famous\" (from פֻּרְסַם , the passive of פִּרְסֵם , \"to publicize\"), and so on. Indeed, the same is true of many \"piʕel\" verbs, including the \"piʕel\" counterparts of two of the above examples: מְבַלְבֵּל , \"confusing\", and מְעַנְיֵן , \"interesting\". The difference is that \"piʕel\" verbs are also frequently used as verbs, whereas \"puʕal\" is much less common.\n\n\"Puʕal\" verbs do not have gerunds, imperatives, or infinitives.\n\nBinyan \"hifʕil\" is another active binyan. \"Hifʕil\" verbs are often causative counterparts of verbs in other binyanim; examples include הִכְתִּיב (\"to dictate\"; the causative of כָּתַב , \"to write\"), הִדְלִיק (\"to turn on (a light)\", transitive; the causative of נִדְלַק , \"(for a light) to turn on\", intransitive), and הִרְשִׁים (\"to impress\"; the causative of התרשם , \"to be impressed\"). Nonetheless, not all are causatives of other verbs; for example, הִבְטִיחַ (\"to promise\"). \n\nBinyan \"huf'al\" is much like binyan \"pu'al\", except that it corresponds to \"hif'il\" instead of to \"pi'el\". Like \"pu'al\", it is not commonly used in ordinary speech, except in present participles that have become adjectives, such as מֻכָּר (\"familiar\", from הֻכַּר , the passive of הִכִּיר , \"to know (a person)\") and מֻגְזָם (\"excessive\", from , the passive of הִגְזִים , \"to exaggerate\"). Like \"puʕal\" verbs, \"hufʕal\" verbs do not have gerunds, imperatives, or infinitives.\n\nBinyan \"hitpa'el\" is rather like binyan \"nif'al\", in that all \"hitpa'el\" verbs are intransitive, and most have a reflexive sense. Indeed, many \"hitpa'el\" verbs are reflexive counterparts to other verbs with the same root; for example, הִתְרַחֵץ (\"to wash oneself\") is the reflexive of רָחַץ (\"to wash\", transitive), and הִתְגַּלֵּחַ (\"to shave oneself\", i.e. \"to shave\", intransitive) is the reflexive of גִּלֵּחַ (\"to shave\", transitive). Some \"hitpaʕel\" verbs are a combination of causative and reflexive; for example,הִסְתַּפֵּר (\"to get one's hair cut\") is the causative reflexive of סִפֵּר (\"to cut (hair)\"), and הִצְטַלֵּם (\"to get one's picture taken\") is the causative reflexive of צִלֵּם (\"to take a picture (of someone or something)\").\n\n\"Hitpa'el\" verbs can also be reciprocal; for example, הִתְכַּתֵּב (\"to write to each other\", i.e. \"to correspond\") is the reciprocal of כָּתַב (\"to write\").\n\nIn all of the above uses, the \"hitpa'el\" verb contrasts with a \"pu'al\" or \"huf'al\" verb in two ways: firstly, the subject of the \"hitpa'el\" verb is generally either performing the action, or at least complicit in it, whereas the subject of the \"pu'al\" or \"huf'al\" verb is generally not; and secondly, \"pu'al\" and \"huf'al\" verbs often convey a sense of completeness, which \"hitpa'el\" verbs generally do not. So whereas the sentence אֲנִי מְצֻלָּם (\"I am photographed\", using \"pu'al\") means something like \"there exists a photo of me\", implying that the photo already exists, and not specifying whether the speaker caused the photo to be taken, the sentence אֲנִי מִצְטַלֵּם (\"I am photographed\", using \"hitpa'el\") means something like \"I'm having my picture taken\", implying that the picture does not exist yet, and that the speaker is causing the picture to be taken.\n\nIn other cases, \"hitpa'el\" verbs are ordinary intransitive verbs; for example, התנהג (\"to behave\"), structurally is the reciprocal of נהג (\"to act\"), as in נְהַג בְּחָכְמָה (\"act wisely\"). However, it is used sparsely, only in sayings as such, and the more common meaning of \"nahaɡ\" is \"to drive\"; for that meaning, הִתְנַהֵג is not a reciprocal form, but a separate verb in effect. For example: in talking about a car that drives itself, one would say מְכוֹנִית שֶׁנּוֹהֶגֶת אֶת עַצְמָהּ (\"a car that drives itself\", using \"nahag\"), not מְכוֹנִית שֶׁמִּתְנַהֶגֶת (\"a car that behaves\", using \"hitnaheg\").\n\nThe Hebrew noun (שֵׁם עֶצֶם ) is inflected for number and state, but not for case and therefore Hebrew nominal structure is normally not considered to be strictly declensional. Nouns are generally related to verbs (by shared roots), but their formation is not as systematic, often due to loanwords from foreign languages. Hebrew nouns are also inflected for definiteness by application of the prefix ַה (ha) before the given noun. Semantically, the prefix \"ha\" corresponds roughly to the English word \"the\".\n\nEvery noun in Hebrew has a gender, either masculine or feminine (or both); for example, סֵפֶר (\"book\") is masculine, while דֶּלֶת (\"door\") is feminine. There is no strict system of formal gender, but there is a tendency for nouns ending in ת () or ה (usually ) to be feminine and for nouns ending in other letters to be masculine. There is a very strong tendency toward natural gender for nouns referring to people and some animals. Such nouns generally come in pairs, one masculine and one feminine; for example, אִישׁ means \"man\" and אִשָּׁה means \"woman\". (When discussing mixed-sex groups, the plural of the masculine noun is used.)\n\nHebrew nouns are inflected for grammatical number; as in English, count nouns have a singular form for referring to one object and a plural form for referring to more than one. Unlike in English, some count nouns also have separate \"dual\" forms, for referring to two objects; see below.\n\nMasculine nouns generally form their plural by adding the suffix ים :\n\nThe addition of the extra syllable usually causes the vowel in the first syllable to shorten if it is Kamatz:\n\nMany common two-syllable masculine nouns accented on the penultimate syllable (often called \"segolates\", because many (but not all) of them have the vowel () in the last syllable), undergo more drastic characteristic vowel changes in the plural:\n\nFeminine nouns ending in or generally drop this ending and add , usually without any vowel changes:\n\nNouns ending in also replace this ending with , with an in the preceding syllable usually changing to :\n\nNouns ending in and replace these endings with and , respectively:\n\nA large number of masculine nouns take the usually feminine ending in the plural:\n\nA small number of feminine nouns take the usually masculine ending :\n\nMany plurals are completely irregular:\n\nSome forms, like אָחוֹת ← אֲחָיוֹת (sister) or חָמוֹת ← חֲמָיוֹת (mother-in-law) reflect the historical broken plurals of Proto-Semitic, which have been preserved in other Semitic languages (most notably Arabic).\n\nHebrew also has a dual number, expressed in the ending , but even in ancient times its use was very restricted. In modern times, it is usually used in expressions of time and number, or items that are inherently dual. These nouns have plurals as well, which are used for numbers higher than two, for example:\n\nThe dual is also used for some body parts, for instance:\n\n\nIn this case, even if there are more than two, the dual is still used, for instance (\"a dog has four legs\").\n\nThe dual is also used for certain objects that are \"inherently\" dual. These words have no singular, for instance משקפים (\"eyeglasses\") and מספרים (\"scissors\"). As in the English \"two pairs of pants\", the plural of these words uses the word זוּג (\"pair\"), e.g. (\"two pairs-of scissors-\"). Similarly, the dual can be found in some place names, such as the city גִּבְעָתַיִם \"\" (\"Twin Peaks\", referring to the two hills of the landscape on which the city is built).\n\nIn Hebrew, as in English, a noun can modify another noun. This is achieved by placing the modifier immediately after what it modifies, in a construction called סְמִיכוּת . The noun being modified appears in its \"construct form\", or \"status constructus\". For most nouns, the construct form is derived fairly easily from the normal (indefinite) form:\n\nThere are many words (usually ancient ones) that have changes in vocalization in the construct form. For example, the construct form of (house) is .\n\nIn addition, the definite article is never placed on the first noun (the one in the construct form).\n\n\nHowever, this rule is not always adhered to in informal or colloquial speech; one finds, for example, הָעוֹרֵךְ דִּין (literally \"the law organiser\", i.e. \"lawyer\").\n\nPossession is generally indicated using the preposition של , \"of\" or \"belonging to\":\n\n\nIn literary style, nouns are inflected to show possession through noun declension; a personal suffix is added to the construct form of the noun (discussed above). So, סִפְרֵי (\"books of\") can be inflected to form סְפָרַי (\"my books\"),סְפָרֶיךָ (\"your books\", singular masculine form), סְפָרֵינוּ (\"our books\"), and so forth, while דִּירַת (\"apartment of\") gives דִּירָתִי (my apartment), דִּירַתְךָ (\"your apartment\"; singular masculine form),דִּירָתֵנוּ (\"our apartment\"), etc.\n\nWhile the use of these forms is mostly restricted to formal and literary speech, they are in regular use in some colloquial phrases, such as ?מָה שְׁלוֹמְךָ (literally \"what peace-of-you?\", i.e. \"what is your peace?\", i.e. \"how are you?\", singular masculine form) or לְדַעֲתִי (\"in my opinion\"/\"according to my knowledge\").\n\nIn addition, the inflected possessive is commonly used for terms of kinship; for instance, בְּנִי (\"my son\"), בִּתָּם (\"their daughter\"), and אִשְׁתּוֹ (\"his wife\") are preferred to הַבֵּן שֶׁלִּי , הַבַּת שֶׁלָּהֶם , and הָאִשָּׁה שֶׁלּוֹ . However, usage differs for different registers and sociolects: In general, the colloquial will use more analytic constructs in place of noun declensions.\n\nIn the same way that Hebrew verbs are conjugated by applying various prefixes, suffixes and internal vowel combinations, Hebrew nouns can be formed by applying various \"meters\" (Hebrew ) and suffixes to the same roots. Gerunds are one example (see above).\n\nMany abstract nouns are derived from another noun, or from a verb (usually one in binyan \"hitpaʕel\") using the suffix :\n\nThe קַטְלָן \"\" meter applied to a root, and the suffix applied to a noun, indicate an agent or job:\nThe suffix usually denotes a diminutive:\n\nThough occasionally this same suffix can denote an augmentative:\n\nRepeating the last two letters of a noun or adjective can also denote a diminutive:\n\nThe קָטֶּלֶת\"\" meter commonly used to name diseases:\n\nHowever, it can have various different meanings as well:\n\nNew nouns are also often formed by the combination of two existing stems:\nרַמְזוֹר uses more strictly recent compound conventions, as the א aleph (today usually silent but historically very specifically a glottal stop) is dropped entirely from spelling and pronunciation of the compound.\n\nSome nouns use a combination of methods of derivation:\n\nIn Hebrew, an adjective (שֵׁם תֹּאַר ) comes after the noun and agrees in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun which it modifies:\n\nAdjectives ending in \"-i\" have slightly different forms:\n\nMasculine nouns that take the feminine plural ending still take masculine plural adjectives, e.g. מְקוֹמוֹת יָפִים (beautiful places\"). The reverse goes for feminine plural nouns ending in , e.g. מִלִּים אֲרֻכּוֹת (long words\").\n\nNote also that many adjectives, like segolate nouns, change their vowel structure in the feminine and plural.\n\nIn Hebrew, unlike in English, each attributive adjective follows the noun and takes the definite article if it modifies a definite noun (either a proper noun, or a definite common noun):\n\n\nThe case of a proper noun highlights the fact that all Hebrew adjectives can be interpreted as appositive nouns. For example, contrast the following:\n\n\nMany adjectives in Hebrew are derived from the present tense of verbs. These adjectives are inflected the same way as the verbs they are derived from:\n\nThe Hebrew term for adverb is תֹּאַר הַפֹּעַל .\n\nHebrew forms adverbs in several different ways.\n\nSome adjectives have corresponding one-word adverbs. In many cases, the adverb is simply the adjective's masculine singular form:\nIn other cases, the adverb has a distinct form:\n\nIn some cases, an adverb is derived from an adjective using its singular feminine form or (mostly in poetic or archaic usage) its plural feminine form:\n\nMost adjectives, however, do not have corresponding one-word adverbs; rather, they have corresponding adverb \"phrases\", formed using one of the following approaches:\n\nThe use of one of these methods does not necessarily preclude the use of the others; for example, \"slowly\" may be either לְאַט (a one-word adverb), בְּאִטִּיּוּת (literally \"in slowness\", a somewhat more elegant way of expressing the same thing) or בְּאֹפֶן אִטִּי (\"in slow fashion\"), as mentioned above.\n\nFinally, as in English, there are various adverbs that do not have corresponding adjectives at all:\n\nLike English, Hebrew is primarily a prepositional language, with a large number of prepositions. Several of Hebrew's most common prepositions, however, unlike any in English, are prefixes rather than separate words; for example, English \"in the room\" is Hebrew בַּחֶדֶר .\n\nThe preposition אֶת plays an important role in Hebrew grammar. Its most common use is to introduce a direct object; for example, English \"I see the book\" is in Hebrew אֲנִי רוֹאֶה אֶת הַסֵּפֶר (literally \"I see \"\" the-book\"). However, אֶת /ʔet/ is used only with semantically \"definite\" direct objects, such as nouns with \"the\", proper nouns, and personal pronouns; with semantically \"indefinite\" direct objects, it is simply omitted: אֲנִי רוֹאֶה סֵפֶר \"ʔani roʔe sefer\" (\"I see a book\") does not use את /ʔet/. This has no direct translation into English, and is best described as an object particle — that is, it denotes that the word it precedes is the direct object of the verb.\n\nFinally, אֶת /ʔet/ has a number of special uses; for example, when the adjective צָרִיךְ (\"in need (of)\") takes a definite noun complement, it uses the preposition אֶת /ʔet/: הָיִיתִי צָרִיךְ אֶת זֶה (literally \"I-was in-need-of this\", i.e. \"I needed this\"). Here as elsewhere, the אֶת is dropped with an indefinite complement: הָיוּ צְרִיכִים יוֹתֵר (literally \"they-were in-need-of more\", i.e. \"they needed more\"). This is perhaps related to the verb-like fashion in which the adjective is used.\n\nIn Biblical Hebrew, there is possibly another use of /ʔet/. Waltke and O'Connor (pp. 177–178) make the point: \"...(1) ...sign of the accusative ... (2) More recent grammarians regard it as a marker of emphasis used most often with definite nouns in the accusative role. The apparent occurrences with the nominative are most problematic ... AM Wilson late in the nineteenth century concluded from his exhaustive study of all the occurrences of the debated particle that it had an intensive or reflexive force in some of its occurrences. Many grammarians have followed his lead. (reference lists studies of 1955, 1964, 1964, 1973, 1965, 1909, 1976.) On such a view, /ʔet/ is a weakened emphatic particle corresponding to the English pronoun 'self' ... It resembles Greek 'autos' and Latin 'ipse' both sometimes used for emphasis, and like them it can be omitted from the text, without obscuring the grammar. This explanation of the particle's meaning harmonizes well with the facts that the particle is used in Mishnaic Hebrew as a demonstrative and is found almost exclusively with determinate nouns.\"\n\nThere is a form called the verbal pronominal suffix, in which a direct object can be rendered as an additional suffix onto the verb. This form allows for a high degree of word economy, as the single fully conjugated verb expresses the verb, its voice, its subject, its object, and its tense.\n\n\nIn modern usage, the verbal pronominal suffixes are rarely used, in favor of expression of direct objects as the inflected form of the separate word \"ʔet\". It is used more commonly in biblical and poetic Hebrew (for instance, in prayers).\n\nIndirect objects are objects requiring a preposition other than אֶת . The preposition used depends on the verb, and these can be very different from the one used in English. A good dictionary is required to look these up. In the case of definite indirect objects, the preposition will replace את .\n\n\nThe Hebrew grammar distinguishes between various kinds of indirect objects, according to what they specify. Thus, there is a division between objects for time תֵּאוּר זְמַן (), objects for place תֵּאוּר מָקוֹם (), objects for reason תֵּאוּר סִבָּה () and many others.\n\nIn Hebrew, there are no distinct prepositional pronouns; if the object of a preposition is a pronoun, but the preposition contracts with the object, and the inflected preposition thus formed can be considered the indirect object of the sentence.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the direct object is often rendered with the word את /ʔet/. /ʔet/ is excluded only when the direct object is a non-definite noun.\n\n הֶסְגֵּר for disclosing the opinion of another party using direct speech (e.g. לְדַעַת הָרוֹפֵא, הָעִשּׁוּן מַזִּיק לַבְּרִיאוּת (\"in the doctor's opinion, smoking is harmful to health\").-->\n\n\nModern Hebrew\nBiblical Hebrew\n\n"}

A massive frame is shaped like a snooker table. The instrument has five notes; each note has six strings (three are tuned to the fundamental pitch, and three an octave higher). The strings are struck by large hammers, covered with cotton-wool, which the performer sets in motion by a strong elastic blow from his or her fist, similar to the motion of playing a carillon.\n\nThe hammers are attached to arms long, which are screwed to a strong wooden span bridge placed horizontally above the strings at about two-fifths of the length from the front. On the point of the arm is the name of the note, and behind this the felt ledge struck by the fist. Two belly bridges and two wrest-plank bridges, one set for each octave, determine the vibrating length of the strings, and the belly bridge, as in other stringed instruments, is the medium through which the vibrations of the strings are communicated to the soundboard. The arrangement of pegs and wrest-pins is much the same as on the piano.\n\nDifficulties arise whenever a composer writes a piece for orchestra in which he calls for reproducing the effect of church bells. Well-known examples include \"1812 Overture\", \"The Golden Legend\", \"Cavalleria Rusticana\", \"Pagliacci\", \"Rienzi\", and \"Parsifal\". The most serious difficulty of all arose in \"Parsifal\", where the bells are called for in an extremely solemn scene with deep religious significance. If real church bells were used for the notes Wagner wrote, they would overpower the orchestra and ruin the solemn atmosphere on the stage.\n\nVarious substitutes for bells were tried in vain, but no other instrument gave a tone similar to that of church bells. This is because a bell sound consists of rich harmonics composing the clang, plus two distinct simultaneous notes, first the tap tone, which gives the pitch, and the hum tone or lower accompanying note. The dignity and beauty of the bell tone depend on the interval separating the hum from the tap tone.\n\nA stringed instrument, similar to the Parsifal bell but having only four notes, was used at Bayreuth for the first performance of \"Parsifal\" in 1882, where it was combined with tam-tams or gongs in an attempt to replicate the sound of a church bell. The instrument was built by the Bayreuth-based pianoforte manufacturer Steingraeber & Söhne. After many trials the following combination was adopted as the best makeshift:\n\nIn most orchestral music, tubular bells are used when a bell sound is called for. In another special case, a special peal of hemispherical bells was constructed for use in performances of Sir Arthur Sullivan's cantata, \"The Golden Legend\". Struck with mallets, they produced both tap and hum tone. But \"Parsifal\" presented a particular problem because the lowest of the \"Golden Legend\" bells was a minor tenth higher than the lowest note required for Parsifal, and the aggregate weight of the four bells was thousands of pounds.\n\nModern productions of \"Parsifal\" typically use a synthesized, or electronically recorded, church bell sound.\n\n"}

A poet and dramatist of highly individual character, he is today remembered in German-speaking literary circles mainly for his translations of the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz; he is also known to music history as having been a close friend of Gustav Mahler.\n\nLipiner was born in Jarosław. A prodigious talent, he produced a well-regarded treatment of 'Prometheus Unbound' at the age of seventeen, He attended the University of Leipzig as a student of philosophy, literature and natural science; one of his teachers was Gustav Fechner. By his early twenties, he had produced an important work on the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and become a personal acquaintance of Nietzsche — who had called him 'a veritable genius'.\n\nLipiner was 24 when he met the 20-year-old Mahler, and his views on various subjects (including the 'redemptive' qualities of artistic creation) came to influence the young composer to a considerable extent. Lipiner features in the 'Recollections of Gustav Mahler' assembled by Natalie Bauer-Lechner — who seems also to have kept a similar record of his actions and conversations, though this is now lost.\n\nAs his creativity waned, Lipiner's reputation seems to have depended more and more upon his personal fascination as a 'bon viveur' and skilled improviser of the philosophical rhapsodies with which he would entertain his circle of illustrious acquaintances in Vienna. Mahler's marriage to Alma Schindler in 1902 was followed by the composer's breaking with Lipiner for several years: the man whom Friedrich Eckstein described as 'that shy, melancholy, sensitive poet' and whom Mahler usually addressed as 'dearest Siegfried' was for Alma the object of a venomous dislike: \"a bogus Goethe in his writing and a haggling Jew in his talk\". By the end of Mahler's life, however, the two men had resumed their friendship. Lipiner died in Vienna a few months after Mahler's death.\n\n"}

The lecture was then published in 1967 as chapter ten of \"Writing and Difference\" (). \n\n\"Structure, Sign, and Play\" identifies a tendency for philosophers to denounce each other for relying on problematic discourse, and argues that this reliance is to some degree inevitable because we can only write in the language we inherit. Discussing the anthropology of Claude Lévi-Strauss, Derrida argues that we are all \"bricoleurs\", creative tinkerers who must use the tools we find around us.\n\nAlthough presented at a conference intended to popularize structuralism, the lecture is widely cited as the starting point for post-structuralism in the United States. Along with Derrida's longer text \"Of Grammatology\", it is also programmatic for the process of deconstruction.\n\nDerrida wrote \"Structure, Sign, and Play\" to present at a conference titled \"The Language of Criticism and the Sciences of Man\" held at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore from 18–21 October 1966. The conference, organized by Richard A. Macksey for the newly founded Humanities Center, and sponsored by the Ford Foundation, brought together a collection of notable French thinkers, including Paul de Man, Roland Barthes, Jean Hyppolite and Jacques Lacan. (Michel Foucault was, in the words of Jean-Michel Rabaté, \"notoriously absent\".) Derrida reportedly wrote his essay rather quickly in the ten or fifteen days preceding the conference. (According to one report, Derrida was a last-minute replacement for anthropologist Luc de Heusch.) \n\nMany attendees came from France, and spoke French during the event; French lectures were translated into English and distributed in print. Derrida's lecture was listed in the program and delivered in French, as \"La structure, le signe et le jeu dans le discours des sciences humaines\". (Lacan was one of the few French attendees to lecture in English; Lacan makes a point of this gesture at the beginning of the lecture, titled \"Of Structure as the Inmixing of an Otherness Prerequisite to Any Subject Whatever\".)\n\n\"Structure, Sign, and Play\" was first published in English in 1970, within a volume dedicated to the Johns Hopkins colloquium titled \"The Structuralist Controversy: The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man\". Macksey and Donato write in the preface to this volume that the goal of the conference was to clarify the field of structuralism and define some of its common problems across disciplines.\n\n\"Structure, sign, and play\" discusses how philosophy and social science understand 'structures' abstractly. Derrida is dealing with structural\"ism\", a type of analysis which understands individual elements of language and culture as embedded in larger structures. The archetypal examples of structuralism come from Ferdinand de Saussure, who showed how phonemes and words gain meaning only through relations with each other. (Derrida dealt directly with Saussure in a related book titled \"Of Grammatology\"). The main object of this text is Claude Lévi-Strauss, whose structuralist anthropology analyzed the relationships between elements of cultural systems such as mythology.\n\nDerrida admires the reflexivity and abstract analyses of structuralism, but argues that these discourses have still not gone far enough in treating structures as free-floating (or 'playing') sets of relationships. In particular, he accuses structuralist discourses of holding on to a \"center\": a privileged term that anchors the structure and does not play. Whether this center is \"God\", \"being\", \"presence\", or \"man\" (as it was at the colloquium), its function is the same, and the history of structures is a history of substitutions, one center after another, for this constant position. Derrida suggests that this model of structure will end—is ending—and that a newer and freer (though still unknown) thinking about structures will emerge.\n\nThe essay begins by speculating, \"Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that could be called an 'event,' if this loaded word did not entail a meaning which it is precisely the function of structural—structuralist—thought to reduce or suspect.\" The 'event' involves changes in structuralism, structure, and in particular \"the structurality of structure\", which has hitherto been limited, writes Derrida, through the process of being assigned a stabilizing \"center\". The \"center\" is that element of a structure which appears given or fixed, thereby anchoring the rest of the structure and allowing it to play. In the history of metaphysics specifically, this function is fulfilled by different terms (which Derrida says are always associated with presence): \"\"eidos, archè, telos, energia, ousia\" (essence, existence, substance, subject) \"aletheia\", transcendentality, consciousness, or conscience, God, man, and so forth.\" Whichever term is at the center of the structure, argues Derrida, the overall pattern remains similar. This central term ironically escapes \"structurality\", the key feature of structuralism according to which all meaning is defined relationally, through other terms in the structure. From this perspective, the center is the most alien or estranged element in a structure: it comes from somewhere outside and remains absolute until a new center is substituted in a seemingly arbitrary fashion. \"The center\", therefore, \"is not the center.\" \n\nThe 'event' under discussion is the opening of the structure, which became inevitable \"when the structurality of structure had to begin to be thought\" and the contradictory role of the center exposed. The result of the event, according to Derrida, must be the full version of structural \"freeplay\", a mode in which all terms are truly subject to the openness and mutability promised by structuralism. Derrida locates the beginning of this process in the writings of earlier philosophers, who continued to use the pattern of metaphysics even as they denounced it in others.\n\nDerrida depicts Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger, three of his greatest influences, as ultimately trapped within a destructive spiral of denunciation. Nietzsche questioned the power of representation and concepts to really convey truth; Freud challenged the idea that mind was limited to consciousness; and Heidegger criticized the idea of \"being as presence\". Derrida argues that these theoretical moves share a common form:\n\nBut all these destructive discourses and all their analogues are trapped in a sort of circle. This circle is unique. It describes the form of the relationship between the history of metaphysics and the destruction of the history of metaphysics. [...] there are many ways of being caught in this circle. They are all more or less naïve, more or less empirical, more or less systematic, more or less close to the formulation or even to the formalization of this circle. It is these differences which explain the multiplicity of destructive discourses and the disagreement between those who make them. It was within concepts inherited from metaphysics that Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger worked, for example. Since these concepts are not elements or atoms and since they are taken from a syntax and a system, every particular borrowing drags along with it the whole of metaphysics. This is what allows these destroyers to destroy each other reciprocally—for example, Heidegger, considering Nietzsche, with as much lucidity and rigor as bad faith and misconstruction, as the last metaphysician, the last \"Platonist.\" One could do the same for Heidegger himself, for Freud, or for a number of others. And today no exercise is more widespread.\n\nDerrida does not assert the possibility of thinking outside such terms; any attempt to undo a particular concept is likely to become caught up in the terms which the concept depends on. For instance: if we try to undo the centering concept of ‘consciousness’ by asserting the disruptive counterforce of the ‘unconscious’, we are in danger of introducing a new center. All we can do is refuse to allow either pole in a system to become the center and guarantor of presence.\n\nHaving described a pattern—denouncing metaphysics while relying on it—in discourses about metaphysics, Derrida suggests consideration of the same pattern within the \"human sciences\", whose subjection to the \"critique of ethnocentrism\" parallels the \"destruction of the history of metaphysics\" in philosophy. Derrida argues that, just as philosophers use metaphysical terms and concepts to critique metaphysics (and criticize the use of these concepts by others), the ethnologist \"accepts into his discourse the premises of ethnocentrism at the very moment when he is employed in denouncing them\". He examines the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, particularly as it concerns \"the opposition between nature and culture\", as his case study and primary focus for the essay.\n\nDerrida highlights Lévi-Strauss's use of the term \"bricolage\", the activity of a \"bricoleur\". \"The \"bricoleur\", says Lévi-Strauss, is someone who uses 'the means at hand,' that is, the instruments he finds at his disposition around him, those which are already there, which had not been especially conceived with an eye to the operation for which they are to be used and to which one tries by trial and error to adapt them, not hesitating to change them whenever it appears necessary.\" \"Bricolage\" becomes a metaphor for philosophical and literary critiques, exemplifying Derrida's previous argument about the necessity of using the language available. The \"bricoleur\"'s foil is the engineer, who creates out of whole cloth without the need for \"bricolage\"—however, the engineer is merely a myth since all physical and intellectual production is really \"bricolage\".\n\nDerrida praises Lévi-Strauss for his insights into the complexities, limitations, and circularities of examining 'a culture' from the outside in order to classify its mythological system. In particular he praises Lévi-Strauss's recognition that a mythological system cannot be studied as though it was some finite portion of physical reality to be scientifically divided and conquered. Derrida quotes Lévi-Strauss's \"The Raw and the Cooked\":\n\nIn effect the study of myths poses a mythological problem by the fact that it cannot conform to the Cartesian principle of dividing the difficulty into as many parts as are necessary to resolve it. There exists no veritable end or term to mythical analysis, no secret unity which could be grasped at the end of the work in decomposition. The themes duplicate themselves to infinity. When we think we have disentangled them from each other and can hold them separate, it is only to realize that they are joining together again, in response to the attraction of unforeseen affinities.\n\nIn Derrida's words, \"structural discourse on myths—mythological discourse—must itself be \"mythopomorphic\"\". Lévi-Strauss explicitly describes a limit to totalization (and at the same time the endlessness of 'supplementarity'). Thus Lévi-Strauss, for Derrida, recognizes the structurality of mythical structure and gestures towards its freeplay.\n\nBut Derrida criticizes Lévi-Strauss for an inability to explain historical changes—for describing structural transformation as the consequence of mysterious outside forces (paralleling the substitute \"centers\" that make up the history of metaphysics). \n\nUltimately, Derrida perceives in Lévi-Strauss \"a sort of ethic of presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and natural innocence, of a purity of presence and self-presence in speech\", arguing that \"this structuralist thematic of broken immediateness is thus the sad, \"negative\", nostalgic, guilty, Rousseauist facet of the thinking of freeplay of which the Nietzschean \"affirmation\"—the joyous affirmation of the freeplay of the world and without truth, without origin, offered to an active interpretation—would be the other side.\" True freeplay, argues Derrida, actually undoes this certainty about presence: \n\nFreeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically conceived, freeplay must be conceived before the alternative of presence and absence; being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not the other way around.\n\nDerrida concludes by reaffirming the existence of a transformation within structuralism, suggesting that it espouses this affirmative view of unlimited freeplay and presenting it as unpredictable yet inevitable.\n\nThe 1966 colloquium, although intended to organize and strengthen the still-murky field of structuralism became known through Derrida's lecture as a turning point and the beginning of the post-structuralist movement. Derrida acknowledged the influence of the Hopkins colloquium, writing in 1989:\n\nIt is more and more often said that the Johns Hopkins colloquium (\"The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man\") was in 1966, more than twenty years ago, an event in which many things changed (it is on purpose that I leave these formulations somewhat vague) on the American scene—which is always more than the American scene. What is now called \"theory\" in this country may even have an essential link with what is said to have happened there in 1966.\n\nScholars attempting to explain the success of Derrida's presentation have argued that it fit well with the current of radicalism developing in the United States.\n\nThe essay sowed the seeds of popularity for French post-structuralism at eastern universities in the United States, particularly Johns Hopkins, Cornell, and Yale. Derrida also returned several times to the Hopkins Humanities Center, the faculty of which still credits his influence. The colloquium also created a demand for the French intellectuals on American campuses, which led notably to Derrida's 1986 recruitment by University of California, Irvine.\n\nThe colloquium came under scrutiny from the new journal \"Telos\" when, in 1970, Richard Moss published an article criticizing its sponsors and denouncing it as an agent of multinational capitalism. Derrida, in particular, drew criticism from Marxists such as Fredric Jameson who called deconstruction overly intellectual and distant from class struggle.\n\n\"The New York Times\" argued in its obituary for Derrida that \"Structure, Sign, and Play\" offered professors of literature a philosophical movement they could legitimately consider their own.\n\n\n\n"}

Some analysts believe it to be a modern euphemism for the assassination (prominent premeditated killing) of an individual by a state organization or institution outside a judicial procedure or a battlefield.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the legal status of targeted killing has become a subject of contention within and between various nations. Historically, at least since the mid-eighteenth century, Western thinking has generally considered the use of assassination as a tool of statecraft to be illegal.

They argue that drones are more humane and more accurate than manned vehicles, and that targeted or \"named killings\" do not occur in any context other than a declared state of war.\n\nSome twenty-six members of Congress, with academics such as Gregory Johnsen and Charles Schmitz, media figures (Jeremy Scahill, Glenn Greenwald, James Traub), civil rights groups (i.e. the American Civil Liberties Union) and ex-CIA station chief in Islamabad, Robert Grenier, have criticized targeted killings as a form of extrajudicial killings, which may be illegal within the United States and possibly under international law. According to statistical analyses provided by Reprieve, 9 children have been killed for every targeted adult the United States has tried to assassinate, and, in numerous failed attempts to kill Ayman al-Zawahri, the CIA has killed 76 children and 29 adult bystanders.\n\nTargeted killings have also been used in Somalia, Kenya, Rwanda and in Libya.\n\nDuring fighting in the Somali Civil War, Sean Devereux described torture and killing by warlords in Kismayo as \"targeted killings, a kind of ethnic cleansing\", shortly before his assassination.\n\nAlso in Africa, Reuters described \"targeted killings of political opponents\" by Hutu army and militias in Rwanda during the Rwandan Genocide. The American State Department reported the \"politically targeted killings\" were a prelude to general massacres in Rwanda.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, targeted killings were employed extensively by death squads in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, and Haiti within the context of civil unrest and war.\n\nDuring the Bush Administration, targeted killings became a frequent tactic of the United States government in the War on Terror. Time was reserved on the President's schedule on Tuesday every week for Bush to review and approve the killing of selected targets, without judicial process. Instances of targeted killing by the United States that have received significant attention include the killing of Osama bin Laden and of American citizens Anwar al-Awlaki and his teenage son in 2011. Under the Obama administration, use of targeted killings expanded, most frequently through use of combat drones operating in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Yemen.\n\nReferring to killings by drug cartels in Washington, D.C. in 1989, mayor Marion Barry infamously stated, \"Washington should not be called the murder capital of the world. We are the targeted-killing capital of the world.\" Barry said that \"targeted killings\" by D.C.'s cartels were comparable to those during the days of \"Al Capone and Eliot Ness\" at the time of Prohibition in the United States. Similarly, drug-related \"mob hits\" in Moscow during the 1990s were euphemistically described as \"targeted killings\" by the Cox News Service and \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\".\n\nThe U.S.-backed Operation Condor was a campaign of political repression and state terror in Latin American right-wing dictatorships involving assassination of political opponents and dissidents. The National Security Archive reported, \"Prominent victims of Condor include two former Uruguayan legislators and a former Bolivian president, Juan José Torres, murdered in Buenos Aires, a former Chilean Minister of the Interior, Bernardo Leighton, as well as former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and his 26-year old American colleague, Ronni Moffitt, assassinated by a car bomb in downtown Washington D.C.\"\n\nIn 1986, the human rights group Americas Watch released a report stating that death squads and armed forces under President José Napoleón Duarte in El Salvador had carried out 240 targeted killings throughout 1985. The report relied upon figures provided by the Roman Catholic Church and included allegations of torture and summary executions. Americas Watch and other rights groups reported \"targeted killing\" of civilians by the Nicaraguan Sandinista government in the following year during its campaign against the Contras. Politically motivated targeted killings of trade unionists and activists were also recorded in Haiti and Colombia during the late 1980s and 1990s. Targeted killings linked to the drug trade and paramilitary organizations including FARC and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) resulted in large numbers of deaths among human rights and political activists, and women and children, throughout the 1990s.\n\nAn early example of American targeted killing is Operation Vengeance during World War II. This counterattack shot down the plane of Isoroku Yamamoto, the senior planner of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the Phoenix Program targeted political leadership of the Viet Cong for assassination.\n\nWhile article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by one state against another, two exceptions are relevant to the question of whether targeted killings are lawful: (1) when the use of force is carried out with the consent of the host state; and (2) when the use of force is in self-defense in response to an armed attack or an imminent threat, and where the host state is unwilling or unable to take appropriate action. The legality of a targeted drone strike must be evaluated in accordance with international humanitarian law (IHL), including the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity.\n\nThe part of The Charter of the United Nations that regulates \"action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression\" is Chapter VII (articles 39-50), which requires that it is the Security Council that determines any threat to peace and decides on measures to be taken to maintain or restore peace. Article 51 mentions the only exception, as being members of the United Nations have \"the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security\".\nThe tactic raises complex questions as to the legal basis for its application, who qualifies as an appropriate \"hit list\" target, and what circumstances must exist before the tactic may be employed. Opinions range from people considering it a legal form of self-defense that reduces terrorism, to people calling it an extrajudicial killing that lacks due process, and which leads to more violence. Methods used have included firing a Hellfire missile from an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter (Israel), or a Predator or Reaper drone (an unmanned, remote-controlled plane), detonating a cell phone bomb, and long-range sniper shooting. Countries such as the U.S. (in Pakistan and Yemen) and Israel (in the West Bank and Gaza) have used targeted killing to kill members of groups such as Al-Qaeda and Hamas.\n\nTargeted killing operations, according to Harvard Law School Professors Gabriella Blum and Philip Heymann, amplify the tension between addressing terrorism as a crime versus addressing terrorism as an act of war. Governments pursuing a law enforcement strategy punish persons for their individual guilt, which must be proven in a court of law, where the accused enjoys the protections of due process guarantees. Governments in the midst of war, on the other hand, may claim a legal obligation to take advantage of the relaxation of peacetime constraints on the use of deadly force. Enemy combatants may be targeted and killed not because they are guilty, but because they are potentially lethal agents of a hostile party. No advance warning is necessary, no attempt to arrest or capture is required, and no effort to minimize casualties among enemy forces is demanded by law. Despite this inherent tension, the United States has made targeted killing—the deliberate assassination of a known terrorist outside the country’s territory, usually by airstrike—an essential part of its counter-terrorism strategy. Hence, the United States has justified the killing of terrorists under a war paradigm. \"Using the war paradigm for counter-terrorism enabled government lawyers to distinguish lethal attacks on terrorists from prohibited assassinations and justify them as lawful battlefield operations against enemy combatants, much like the uncontroversial targeted killing of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto while he was traveling by a military airplane during World War II.\"\nFurther support for the U.S. government’s use of drone strike tactics is found in a report found in the Journal of Strategic Security concerning the surgical nature of drone strikes for use in a populated area. The author concedes, \"Indeed the tactic of using drones promises the ability of eliminating enemies in complex environments, while minimizing the political implications of resorting to war.\"\n\nThe domestic legislative basis offered to justify drone strikes is the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF), a joint resolution of both houses of Congress passed exactly one week after 11 September 2001. The AUMF permits the President to use \"all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons\".\n\nA report published in the Journal of Strategic Security focusing on the future of drones in geopolitics finds the U.S. government's use of drones in targeted killing operations and \"indiscriminant and disproportionate use of force that violates the sovereignty of Pakistan\".\n\nIn early 2010, with President Barack Obama's approval, Anwar al-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be approved for targeted killing by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in September 2011.\n\nA Reuters report analysing the killing of 500 \"militants\" by US drones between 2008 and 2010 found that only 8% of those killed were mid- to top-tier organisers or leaders; the rest were unidentified foot soldiers.\n\n\"The Intercept\" reported, \"Between January 2012 and February 2013, U.S. special operations airstrikes [in northeastern Afghanistan] killed more than 200 people. Of those, only 35 were the intended targets. During one five-month period of the operation, according to the documents, nearly 90 percent of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets.\"\n\nIn a speech titled \"The Ethics and Efficacy of the President's Counterterrorism Strategy\" John O. Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, outlined on 30 April 2012 at the Wilson Center the use of combat drones to kill members of al-Qaeda by the US Federal government under President Barack Obama. John Brennan acknowledged for the first time that the US government uses drones to kill selected members of al-Qaeda.\n\nHe justified the use of drones both from domestic law and international law point of view. With respect to domestic law Brennan stated, \"as a matter of domestic law, the Constitution empowers the President to protect the nation from any imminent threat of attack. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks authorizes the president \"to use all necessary and appropriate force\" against those nations, organizations and individuals responsible for 9/11. There is nothing in the AUMF that restricts the use of military force against al-Qa'ida to Afghanistan.\" And he further said: \"As a matter of international law, the United States is in an armed conflict with al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces, in response to the 9/11 attacks, and we may also use force consistent with our inherent right of national self-defense. There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat.\"\n\nThe speech came a few days after Obama authorized the CIA and the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to fire on targets based solely on their intelligence \"signatures\" — patterns of behavior that are detected through signals intercepts, human sources and aerial surveillance, and that indicate the presence of an important operative or a plot against U.S. interests. Under the previous rules the CIA and the US military were only allowed to use drone strikes against known terrorist leaders whose location could be confirmed and who appeared on secret CIA and JSOC target lists.\n\nThe justification by Brennan built upon remarks by US top officials like the State Department's top lawyer Harold Hongju Koh, US Attorney General Eric Holder, the US Defense Department general counsel Jeh Johnson and President Obama himself who defended the use of drones outside of so-called \"hot battlefields\" like Afghanistan.\nIn 2011/2012, the process for selecting targets outside of warzones was altered so that power was concentrated in the hands of a group of people in the White House centered around White House counterterror chief John Brennan. Under the new plan, Brennan's staff compiles the potential target list and runs the names past agencies such as the State Department at a weekly White House meeting. According to the \"New York Times\", President Obama has placed himself at the helm of a top secret process to designate terrorists for kill or capture, reserving the final say on approving lethal action, and signs off every strike in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan.\n\nU.S. Congressional oversight over the targeted killing operations increased as the drone program intensified under the Obama Administration. Once a month, a group of staff members from the House and Senate intelligence committees would watch videos of the latest drone strikes, review intelligence that was used to justify each drone strike, and sometimes examine telephone intercepts and after-the-fact evidence, such as the CIA's assessment of who was hit. The procedure used by House and Senate intelligence committees to monitor CIA drone strikes was set up largely at the request of Senator Dianne Feinstein who became determined to ensure that it was as precise as the CIA had been claiming. \"That's been a concern of mine from the beginning,\" Feinstein said in little-noticed comments after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. \"I asked that this effort be established. It has been. The way in which this is being done is very careful.\" Feinstein explained how the oversight works in general. \"We receive notification with key details shortly after every strike, and we hold regular briefings and hearings on these operations,\" Feinstein wrote in May in a letter sent in response to a column that ran in the \"Los Angeles Times\" questioning the oversight of drone strikes. \"Committee staff has held 28 monthly in-depth oversight meetings to review strike records and question every aspect of the program including legality, effectiveness, precision, foreign policy implications and the care taken to minimize noncombatant casualties.\" If the congressional committees objected to something, the lawmakers could call CIA leaders to testify in closed investigative hearings. If unsatisfied, they could pass legislation limiting the CIA's actions.\n\nCongressional criticism of drone strikes has been rare. However, in June 2012, 26 lawmakers, all but two of them Democrats, signed a letter to Obama questioning so-called signature strikes, in which the U.S. attacks armed men who fit a pattern of behavior that suggests they are involved in terrorist activities. Signature strikes have been curbed in Pakistan, where they once were common, but in 2012 Obama gave the CIA permission to conduct them in Yemen, where an Al Qaeda affiliate that has targeted the United States has established a safe haven in the south. The lawmakers expressed concern that signature strikes could kill civilians. They added: \"Our drone campaigns already have virtually no transparency, accountability or oversight.\"\n\nWhile the Bush administration had put emphasis on killing significant members of al Qaeda, the use of combat drones underwent a quiet and unheralded shift during the Obama Administration to focus increasingly on killing militant foot soldiers rather than high-value targets according to CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. Bergen noted: \"To the extent that the targets of drone attacks can be ascertained, under Bush, al Qaeda members accounted for 25% of all drone targets compared to 40% for Taliban targets. Under Obama, only 8% of targets were al Qaeda compared to just over 50% for Taliban targets.\"\nFacing the possibility of defeat in the 2012 Presidential election, the Obama administration accelerated work in the weeks before the election to develop explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones, so that a new president would inherit clear standards and procedures. The work to codify U.S. drone policy began in summer 2011. \"There was concern that the levers might no longer be in our hands,\" said one unnamed U.S official. With a continuing debate about the proper limits of drone strikes, Obama did not want to leave an \"amorphous\" program to his successor, the official said. The effort, which would have been rushed to completion by January had Mitt Romney won, will now be finished at a more leisurely pace, the official said. \"One of the things we've got to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need Congressional help in order to do that, to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in terms of some of the decisions that we're making,\" Obama said and added \"creating a legal structure, processes, with oversight checks on how we use unmanned weapons, is going to be a challenge for me and my successors for some time to come.\" U.S. President Obama also expressed wariness of the powerful temptation drones pose to policy makers. \"There's a remoteness to it that makes it tempting to think that somehow we can, without any mess on our hands, solve vexing security problems,\" he said.\n\nIn response lawsuits brought by \"The New York Times\" and the American Civil Liberties Union seeking to use the Freedom of Information Act to make public more details about the legal basis for the drone programs U.S. District Court Judge Colleen McMahon ruled at the end of December 2012 that the U.S. Government has no legal duty to disclose legal opinions justifying the use of drones to kill suspected terrorist operatives abroad. While noting that a more detailed disclosure of the administration's legal rationale \"would allow for intelligent discussion and assessment of a tactic that (like torture before it) remains hotly debated\", McMahon came to the conclusion that the Freedom of Information Act did not permit her to require such transparency.\n\nIn a letter dated 22 May 2013 to the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee, Patrick J. Leahy, U.S. attorney general Eric Holder wrote that the United States will use lethal force by combat drones \"in a foreign country against a U.S. citizen who is a senior operational leader of al Qa'ida or its associated forces, and who is actively engaged in planning to kill Americans, in the following circumstances: (1) the U.S. government has determined, after a thorough and careful review, that the individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States; (2) capture is not feasible; and (3) the operation would be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable law of war principles.\" In a Presidential Policy Guidance entitled \"U.S. Policy Standards and Procedures for the Use of Force in Counterterrorism Operations Outside the United States and Areas of Active Hostilities\" from May 2013 the United States government stated that lethal force by combat drones \"will be used only to prevent or stop attacks against U.S. persons, and even then, only when capture is not feasible and no other reasonable alternatives exist to address the threat effectively\". The U.S. government further declared, \"lethal force will be used outside areas of active hostilities only when the following preconditions are met:\n\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama touched on the subject of combat drones in a speech on Counterterrorism delivered on 23 May 2013 at the National Defense University. \"It is a hard fact that US strikes have resulted in civilian casualties,\" he said, adding, \"These deaths will haunt us. But as commander-in-chief I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternative. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties.\" Obama said new guidance allowed targeting only those terrorists posing \"a continuing and imminent threat to the American people\", which administration officials said meant only individuals planning attacks on the U.S. homeland or against U.S. persons abroad. Obama defended the use of drones as just because America \"is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban and their associated forces\". To stop terrorists from gaining a foothold, drones will be deployed according to Obama, but only when there is an imminent threat; no hope of capturing the targeted terrorist; \"near certainty\" that civilians won't be harmed; and \"there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat\". Never will a strike be punitive.\n\nA report by Ben Emmerson QC, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, who identified 33 drone strikes around the world that have resulted in civilian casualties and may have violated international humanitarian law urged the United States \"to further clarify its position on the legal and factual issues ... to declassify, to the maximum extent possible, information relevant to its lethal extraterritorial counter-terrorism operations; and to release its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft, together with information on the evaluation methodology used\". Human Rights Watch said that in Yemen more civilians were killed than admitted by the Obama administration, while Amnesty International said the same of drone strikes in Pakistan. Caitlin Hayden, a White House spokeswoman, declined to comment on the reports, but said in an e-mail statement: \"As the President emphasized, the use of lethal force, including from remotely piloted aircraft, commands the highest level of attention and care.\"\n\nWhile the U.S. government is considering whether to kill an American abroad suspected of planning terrorist attacks and how to do so legally under new stricter targeting policy issued in 2013, The Intercept reported that the U.S. government is using primarily NSA surveillance to target people for drone strikes overseas. In its report \"The Intercept\" the author details the flawed methods which are used to locate targets for lethal drone strikes, resulting in the deaths of innocent people. According to the \"Washington Post\", NSA analysts and collectors (i.e. NSA personnel who control electronic surveillance equipment) use the NSA's sophisticated surveillance capabilities to track individual targets geographically and in real time, while drones and tactical units aim their weaponry against those targets to take them out.\n\nNBC News released in February 2014 an undated Department of Justice White paper entitled \"Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qa'ida or An Associated Force\" in which the Obama Administration concludes that the U.S. government can order the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be \"senior operational leaders\" of al-Qaida or \"an associated force\" – even if there is no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S. However any such targeted killing operation by the United States would have to comply with the four fundamental law-of-war principles governing the use of force which are necessity, distinction, proportionality and humanity – i.e., the avoidance of unnecessary suffering. (Page 8 of ). The memo also discusses why targeted killings would not be a war crime or violate a U.S. executive order banning assassinations:\n\n\"A lawful killing in self-defense is not an assassination. In the Department's view, a lethal operation conducted against a U.S. citizen whose conduct poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States would be a legitimate act of national self-defense that would not violate the assassination ban. Similarly, the use of lethal force, consistent with the laws of war, against an individual who is a legitimate military target would be lawful and would not violate the assassination ban.\"\n\nIn 2013, a report on drone warfare and aerial sovereignty proposed that U.S. government drone policy in Pakistan potentially violated human rights according to the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The rights in direct question were the right to life; right to a fair trial; the freedom of association; right to protection of the family; and, less directly, right to highest attainable health standards; right to education; and right of freedom from hunger.\n\nOn 21 April 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the above-mentioned December 2012 ruling by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon and ruled that the Obama administration must release documents justifying its drone-killings of Americans and foreigners. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal released on 23 June 2014 a Juli 2010 memo by then U.S. Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel David Barron which outlined the rationale for killing the American Citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi.\n\nCIA-ordered drone strikes were eventually ended by President Obama, who transferred control entirely to the U.S. military, under a separate legal authority. President Trump reversed this decision in 2017.\n\nAlleged and confirmed assassinations were reported to have been conducted by the Islamic Republic of Iran and previously by the Pahlavi regime. It includes attempts on notable persons who were reported to have been specifically targeted by the various Iranian security and intelligence forces, most notably against Kurdish dissidents of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran in the 1980s and 1990s. Prior to the establishment of the Islamic State in 1979, the Organization of Intelligence and National Security also allegedly performed a number of political motivated assassinations against dissidents and opposition leaders.\n\nAccording to Ronen Bergman, \"since World War II, Israel has used assassination and targeted-killing more than any other country in the West, in many cases endangering the lives of civilians.\"\n\nDuring the First Intifada Palestinian uprising, the Palestinian human-rights group Al Haq condemned Israeli soldiers for what they described as \"deliberate, cold-blooded... targeted\" killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The human rights group, Middle East Watch, alleged in 1993 that interviewed Israeli soldiers had targeted often unarmed Palestinians, some under the age of 16, for \"premeditated assassinations\" or targeted killing, a charge denied by Israeli officials. The allegations included the execution of Palestinians in custody.\n\nControversy over targeted killings continued during the Second Intifada. Palestinians charged that individuals belonging to the group Hamas and shot in targeted killings were being assassinated; Israeli stated that those killed were responsible for attacks against Israelis. Israeli officials initially accepted responsibility for only some of the killings, and Israeli media termed the practice a \"liquidations policy\", whereas Palestinians called it \"state terrorism\". In January 2001 Israeli officials confirmed \"the practice of targeted assassinations\". Conflict in Israeli over the legality of the practice centered on the case of Dr. Thabet Thabet, assassinated as he left his home on New Year's Eve. Dr. Thabet was alleged by the Israeli military to be a senior local leader of Fatah and plotting attacks against Israelis in the West Bank. A dentist, Dr. Thabet was also a friend of many Israeli peace activists and considered one himself. Israeli activists called the killing \"a crime\", \"Mafia-style\", and \"immoral\". Ephraim Sneh, then Israeli Deputy Prime Minister, described the policy as \"effective, precise and just\".\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" commented that Israeli policy of targeted killing during the Second Intifada expanded upon previous policies, targeting not only terrorists but also those thought to direct or coordinate them. Another controversial killing, which occurred following the Bush Administration's condemnation of the practice, was that of Mahmoud Madani, a leader of Hamas shot while leaving a mosque in the Balata refugee camp. The Israeli military suspected Madani of plotting bombings in Israel.\n\nAt that time, spokesman for the U.S. State Department Richard Boucher condemned both violence by Palestinians and targeted killings by Israelis during a State Department news briefing. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell registered his opposition to \"a policy of targeted killings\" and the U.S. State Department urged Israel to stop them.\n\nThen Democratic Party senator Joseph Biden criticized the George W. Bush Administration for condemning the targeted killings; the administration continued to oppose them.\n\nSome of the known operations include the following.\n\nUse of targeted killings by Israeli conventional military forces became commonplace after the Second Intifada, when Israeli security forces used the tactic to kill Palestinian militants.\n\nIn the Philippines, since Rodrigo Duterte assumption of the presidency in 2016, police and vigilantes have targeted drug related criminal suspects, with many cases, some involving children, thought to be the result of police extrajudicial executions. The group Human Rights Watch has described these extrajudicial killings as \"targeted killings\".\n\nDuring a 2016 visit to Damascus, British statesman David Davis was shown by Syria's Bashar al-Assad a spreadsheet outlining the identities of 783 whose targeted killing he had approved.\n\nReferring to human rights abuses during the Bosnian War, the U.S. State Department noted politically or ethnically motivated \"targeted killings\" in Bosnia in Section 1a., \"Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing\", of its 1993 report on human rights practices in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Targeted killings were also reported by Serbian and Albanian forces during the Kosovo War. Both wars involved large scale targeted killings of journalists.\n\nDuring the First Chechen War, Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudaev was killed on 21 April 1996 by two laser-guided missiles when he was using a satellite phone, after his location was detected by a Russian reconnaissance aircraft, which intercepted his phone call.\n\nOn 20 March 2002, Ibn al-Khattab, who led his militia against Russian forces in Chechnya during the First and Second Chechen War, setting up many effective ambushes against Russian forces as well as managing the influx of foreign fighters and money, was killed when a Dagestani messenger hired by the Russian FSB gave Khattab a poisoned letter. Chechen sources said that the letter was coated with \"a fast-acting nerve agent, possibly sarin or a derivative\".\n\nOn 13 February 2004, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who served as acting president of the breakaway Chechen Republic of Ichkeria between 1996 and 1997, was killed when a bomb ripped through his SUV in the Qatari capital, Doha. Yandarbiyev was seriously wounded and died in hospital. His 13-year-old son Daud was seriously injured. The day after the attack, Qatari authorities arrested three Russians in a Russian embassy villa. One of them, the first secretary of the Russian Embassy in Qatar, Aleksandr Fetisov, was released in March due to his diplomatic status and the remaining two, the GRU agents Anatoly Yablochkov (also known as Belashkov) and Vasily Pugachyov (sometimes misspelled as Bogachyov), were charged with the assassination of Yandarbiyev, an assassination attempt of his son Daud Yandarbiyev, and smuggling weapons into Qatar. There were some speculations that Fetisov had been released in exchange for Qatari wrestlers detained in Moscow. On 30 June 2004, both Russians were sentenced to life imprisonment; passing the sentence, the judge stated that they had acted on orders from the Russian leadership. But on 23 December 2004, Qatar agreed to extradite the prisoners to Russia, where they would serve out their life sentences. The agents however received a heroes' welcome on returning to Moscow in January 2005 but disappeared from public view shortly afterwards. The Russian prison authorities admitted in February 2005 that they were not in jail, but said that a sentence handed down in Qatar was \"irrelevant\" in Russia.\n\nOn 10 July 2006 Shamil Basayev, a Chechen militant leader who was alleged to be responsible for numerous guerrilla attacks on security forces in and around Chechnya and the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and described by ABC News as \"one of the most-wanted terrorists in the world\", was killed by an explosion near the border of North Ossetia in the village of Ali-Yurt, Ingushetia, a republic bordering Chechnya. According to the official version of Basayev's death, the FSB, following him with a drone, spotted his car approach a truck laden with explosives that the FSB had prepared, and by remote control triggered a detonator in the explosives.\n\nAlexander Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium, which a public inquiry in the UK concluded was carried out by FSB agents.\n\nUS and UK intelligence agents reportedly say they believe Russian assassins and possibly the Russian government could have been behind at least fourteen targeted killings on British soil, which were dismissed as non-suspicious by UK police.\n\nUkrainian authorities have blamed Russian security services for multiple killings in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian government is alleged by the British government of being behind a failed assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal and his daughter using a Novichok agent.\n\nThe U.S. Army's \"Law of Land Warfare\" (Field Manual 27-10) states:\n31. Assassination and Outlawry\n\nIt is especially forbidden * * * to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army. [Article 23(b) of the 1907 Hague Regulations]\n\nThis article is construed as prohibiting assassination, proscription, or outlawry of an enemy, or putting a price upon an enemy's head, as well as offering a reward for an enemy \"dead or alive\". It does not, however, preclude attacks on individual soldiers or officers of the enemy whether in the zone of hostilities, occupied territory, or elsewhere.\nDaniel Reisner, who headed the International Legal Division of the Israeli Military Advocate General's Office from 1994 to 2005, has stated that although targeted killing is illegal under previous understanding of international law, \"If you do something for long enough, the world will accept it. The whole of international law is now based on the notion that an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible if executed by enough countries.\" Reisner continues, \"International law progresses through violations. We invented the targeted assassination thesis and we had to push it. At first there were protrusions that made it hard to insert easily into the legal moulds. Eight years later it is in the center of the bounds of legitimacy.\" This view is disputed by George Bisharat of the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, who contends that assassination is not widely regarded as legal.\n\nGeorgetown Law Professor and former U.S. Marine, Gary Solis, has argued that under certain conditions, \"Assassinations and targeted killings are very different acts.\" For Solis, these conditions require that there is an ongoing military conflict, the targeted individual (civilian or military) has taken up arms, that there is no reasonable possibility of arrest, and that the decision to kill is made by senior political leaders.\n\nAbraham Sofaer, a former legal advisor to the U.S. State Department and fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution think tank, has written that targeted killing is \"sometimes necessary, because leaders are obliged to defend their citizens\". After the killing of Hamas founder and quadriplegic Ahmed Yassin by Israeli helicopter gunships, Sofaer argued that targeted killing is not prohibited by American Executive Order 11905 banning assassination: \"killings in self-defense are no more 'assassinations' in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers.\"\n\nSofaer had previously argued during the First Gulf War that targeted killing was ethical but impractical: \"Targeted killing will also invite revenge against the leaders who order it as well as their citizens and property. Given the legal, political and moral constraints that limit such activities in democratic regimes, the United States has a substantial interest in discouraging acceptance of the killing of political leaders as a routine measure, even in self-defense.\"\n\nAuthor and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued, \"there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination. Assassination ... constitutes an illegal killing.\" Amos Guiora, formerly an Israel Defense Forces Lt. Colonol and commander of the IDF school of military law, now Professor of law at the University of Utah, has written, \"targeted killing is ... not an assassination\". Steve David, Johns Hopkins Associate Dean & Professor of International Relations, writes: \"there are strong reasons to believe that the Israeli policy of targeted killing is not the same as assassination.\" Syracuse Law Professor William Banks and GW Law Professor Peter Raven-Hansen write: \"Targeted killing of terrorists is ... not unlawful and would not constitute assassination.\" Rory Miller writes: \"Targeted killing ... is not 'assassination'\", and associate professor Eric Patterson and Teresa Casale write: \"Perhaps most important is the legal distinction between targeted killing and assassination.\"\n\nAmerican defense department analyst and professor Thomas Hunter has defined targeted killing as the \"premeditated, preemptive, and intentional killing of an individual or individuals known or believed to represent a present or future threat to the safety and security of a state through the affiliation with terrorist groups or individuals. Hunter writes that the target is a person who is allegedly taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has allegedly lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the Third Geneva Convention. Hunter distinguishes between \"targeted killing\" and \"targeted violence\" as used by specialists who study violence.\n\nIn response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11, the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) stated on 14 September 2001, \"That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, harbored, committed, or aided in the planning or commission of the attacks against the United States that occurred on 11 September 2001, and to deter and pre-empt any future acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States\". This authorization is still in effect today. There are no restrictions regarding the physical location of where this law is applied. It only states that the President has the \"authority to use all necessary and appropriate force\" this could be interpreted to mean that the President can attack al-Qaeda anywhere in the world.\n\nDuring the 1998 bombing of Iraq, \"The Scotsman\" reported, \"US law prohibits the targeted killing of foreign leaders... Administration officials have been careful to say they will not expressly aim to kill Saddam.\"\n\nFrank Sauer and Niklas Schoernig have described targeted killing as a violation of international law and a contravention of domestic laws, and maintain that the term itself is merely a legitimized euphemism for assassination.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union states in its website, \"A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield.\"\nYael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article \"By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'\":\nThe argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.\nIn 2001, Ibrahim Nafie criticized the U.S. for agreeing with \"the Israeli spin that calls ... its official policy of assassinating Palestinian leaders 'targeted killing'.\"\n\nIn 2013, United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism, Ben Emmerson, stated that U.S. drone strikes may have violated international humanitarian law.\n\nFor drone strikes to be effective, the United States must obtain consent from the host country they are operating in. The growing chorus of objections from host countries, most notably emanating from Pakistan, seriously inhibits drones’ effectiveness. \"Host states have grown frustrated with U.S. drone policy, while opposition by non-host partners could impose additional restrictions on the use of drones. Reforming U.S. drone strike policies can do much to allay concerns internationally by ensuring that targeted killings are defensible under international legal regimes that the United States itself helped establish and by allowing U.S. officials to openly address concerns and counter misinformation.\" Micah Zenko at the Council on Foreign Relations believes the United States should \"end so-called signature strikes, which target unidentified militants based on their behavior patterns and personal networks, and limit targeted killings to a small number of specific terrorists with transnational ambitions. He wants more congressional oversight of drone strikes and stricter regulation on armed drone sales. Finally, he recommends the United States work with international partners to establish rules and norms governing the use of drones. Zenko believes the U.S. government has not been transparent regarding how non-battlefield drone strikes are reconciled with broader foreign policy objectives, the scope of legitimate targets, and their legal framework. While drones may be a critical counterterrorism tool that advances U.S. interests, their \"lack of transparency threatens to limit U.S. freedom of action and risks proliferation of armed drone technology without the requisite normative framework.\" Zenko thinks current drone policy might share the same fate of the Bush-era enhanced interrogation techniques and warrantless wiretapping, both of which were unpopular, illegal and ultimately ended.\n\nHarvard Law School Professors Gabriella Blum and Philip Heymann cite six potential hazards of targeted killings: First, the so-called Hydra effect, or the rise of more—and more resolute—leaders to replace those who were recently \"decapitated.\" Second, drones can drive terrorist leaders into hiding, making the monitoring of their movements, and subsequent intelligence gathering, extremely difficult. Third, \"the political message flowing from the use of targeted killings may be harmful to the attacking country’s interest, as it emphasizes the disparity in power between the parties and reinforces popular support for the terrorists, who are seen as a David fighting Goliath.\" Fourth, when conducted in a foreign country, drone strikes run the risk of heightening tensions between the targeting government and the government in whose territory the operation is conducted. Fifth, targeted killings threaten criticism from local domestic constituencies against the government allowing strikes within their country. Finally, there is a danger of over-using targeted killings, both within and outside the war of terrorism.\n\nDaniel Byman, security studies professor at Georgetown University, argues that Washington must clarify its policies behind extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings, lest a nefarious precedent in international law is set. Additionally, Byman argues that Washington must \"remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid.\" Though Byman recognizes the problems inherent in using armed UAVs, he believes that they are very effective. \"U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,000 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban--top figures who are not easily replaced.\" Drones have also undercut terrorists' ability to effectively communicate with its target audiences, ultimately straining their recruitment pools. To avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda operates have avoided gathering in large numbers and mitigated use of electronic devices. Byman argues that al Qaeda leaders \"cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire coupe of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda's command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders.\"\n\nAudrey Kurth Cronin of George Mason University argues that while drones are tactically savvy, they have failed to advance the strategic goals of U.S. counter-terrorism policy. Terrorism itself is a tactic, Cronin notes, but it succeeds on a strategic plane when a shocking event is successfully leveraged for political gain. \"To be effective, counter-terrorism must itself respond with a coherent strategy. The problem for Washington today is that its drone program has taken on a life of its own, to the point where tactics are driving strategy rather than the other way around.\" Cronin agrees with Daniel Byman of Georgetown University insofar that drones have inflicted real damage upon al Qaeda. However, \"Washington now finds itself in a permanent battle with amorphous and geographically dispersed foe, one with an increasingly marginal connection to the original 9/11 plotters. In this endless contest, the United States risks multiplying its enemies and heightening their incentives to attack the country.\"\n\nThis list is in chronological order broken down by publication areas\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25353549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25353549", "title": "Type (designation)", "text": "Type (designation)\n\nThe word Type followed by a number is a common way to name a weapon or product in a production series, similar in meaning to \"Mark\". \"Type\" was used extensively by the Japanese and Chinese militaries beginning in the 1920s, and is still in current use by the militaries of both nations. The United Kingdom uses a type number system for much of their military equipment. Many other nations use the word \"Type\" to designate products in a series.\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) began using the Type-Number System in 1921 to designate aircraft accepted for production. The numbers used after the word \"Type\" were based on the number of years that the Emperor Taishō had reigned. Since his reign began in 1912, an aircraft ordered into production in 1921 would have been called \"Type 10\", the tenth year of the emperor's reign. At the end of 1926, the emperor died, leaving his son Hirohito as the Emperor Shōwa, and the numbering system was reset to mark the new emperor's reign.\nIn 1929, the government of Japan adopted a new system based on the imperial year. Aircraft ordered for production from 1929 onward were assigned the last two digits of the year marking the continuity of Japanese emperors. 1929 was the 2589th imperial year, so aircraft ordered that year were designated \"Type 89\". 1940 was the 2600th year, and the IJN numbering system was reset to single digits. New aircraft were designated 0 (zero). The well-known Mitsubishi A6M Zero was ordered into production in 1940 as the IJN \"Type 0 Carrier Fighter\" (\"Rei shiki Kanjō sentōki\", 零式艦上戦闘機), and was popularly called the \"Zero\" because of its type.\n\nIn 1943, the designation system was abandoned by the IJN as it was considered too revealing about the nature of the aircraft. In its place, the aircraft were named with popular terms such as \"Kyōfū\" (強風 \"Strong Wind\") for the Kawanishi N1K introduced in 1943.\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) began using the Type designation system in 1927, for all weapons, vehicles, military equipment, subassemblies and subsystems such as engines and gunmounts. In 1940, instead of resetting to zero, the IJA assigned \"Type 100\" to equipment put into production that year. In 1941, the IJA reset to \"Type 1\". Unlike the IJN, the IJA continued to use the system through 1945 with the production of the Kawasaki Ki-100 Army Type 5 Fighter.\n\nAfter 1945, Japan's military changed to a numbering system based on the Japanese fiscal year which begins on April 1 in the same manner as the British fiscal year. As an example, \"Type 63\" was the designation for equipment such as the Type 63 AT mine accepted in 1963.\n\nThe kanji character \"shiki\" (式) is what the Japanese use to designate products in a series. The English language translation of \"shiki\" has been variously given as \"model\" or \"type\". Some manuals and texts have translated \"shiki\" as both \"model\" and \"type\" within the same publication, confusing the matter. World War II-era military dictionaries do not give \"shiki\" as the Japanese word for \"model\"—instead, the kanji character \"kata\" is given. In turn, \"kata\" (型 or 形) is translated as \"form\", \"type\", \"pattern\", \"mark\", or \"model\". The only Japanese language translation given for the English word \"type\" is \"shiki\".\n\nChinese weapons and military vehicles are often, but not always, designated according to the Gregorian calendar, the one used by most nations. Two digits are used to designate the year. The two digits appear first, followed by the character \"shi\", meaning \"type\". As examples, in 1956, the Type 56 assault rifle was put into production, and the Type 64 pistol was designed and approved in 1964.\n\nThe Royal Navy uses a type number system where blocks of numbers are reserved for specific purposes. For instance, the block 900–999 was given to naval radar sets beginning in 1945 and continuing for roughly 20 years. Numbers are not always sequential, as the Type 992 target indication radar was developed long before the Type 967 target designation radar. When a reserved block has been fully utilized, another is assigned.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44365", "title": "Typewriter", "text": "Typewriter\n\nA typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for writing characters similar to those produced by printer's movable type. Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, and pressing one causes a different single character to be produced on the paper, by causing a ribbon with dried ink to be struck against the paper by a type element similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing. Commonly a separate type element (called a typebar) corresponds to each key, but the mechanism may also use a single type element (such as a typeball) with a different portion of it used for each possible character. At the end of the nineteenth century, the term \"typewriter\" was also applied to a person who used a typing machine.\nThe first commercial typewriters were introduced in 1874, but did not become common in offices until after the mid-1880s. The typewriter quickly became an indispensable tool for practically all writing other than personal handwritten correspondence. It was widely used by professional writers, in offices, and for business correspondence in private homes.\n\nNotable typewriter manufacturers included E. Remington and Sons, IBM, Imperial Typewriters, Oliver Typewriter Company, Olivetti, Royal Typewriter Company, Smith Corona, Underwood Typewriter Company, Adler Typewriter Company and .\n\nAlthough many modern typewriters have one of several similar designs, their invention was incremental, developed by numerous inventors working independently or in competition with each other over a series of decades. As with the automobile, telephone, and telegraph, a number of people contributed insights and inventions that eventually resulted in ever more commercially successful instruments. Historians have estimated that some form of typewriter was invented 52 times as thinkers tried to come up with a workable design.\n\nSome of the early typing instruments: \n\nBy the mid-19th century, the increasing pace of business communication had created a need for mechanization of the writing process. Stenographers and telegraphers could take down information at rates up to 130 words per minute, whereas a writer with a pen was limited to a maximum of 30 words per minute (the 1853 speed record).\n\nFrom 1829 to 1870, many printing or typing machines were patented by inventors in Europe and America, but none went into commercial production. \n\nIn 1865, Rev. Rasmus Malling-Hansen of Denmark invented the Hansen Writing Ball, which went into commercial production in 1870 and was the first commercially sold typewriter. It was a success in Europe and was reported as being used in offices in London as late as 1909. Malling-Hansen used a solenoid escapement to return the carriage on some of his models which makes him a candidate for the title of inventor of the first \"electric\" typewriter.\n\nAccording to the book \"Hvem er skrivekuglens opfinder?\" (English: \"Who is the inventor of the Writing Ball?\"), written by Malling-Hansen's daughter, Johanne Agerskov, in 1865, Malling-Hansen made a porcelain model of the keyboard of his writing ball and experimented with different placements of the letters to achieve the fastest writing speed. Malling-Hansen placed the letters on short pistons that went directly through the ball and down to the paper. This, together with the placement of the letters so that the fastest writing fingers struck the most frequently used letters, made the Hansen Writing Ball the first typewriter to produce text substantially faster than a person could write by hand.\n\nThe Hansen Writing Ball was produced with only upper-case characters. The Writing Ball was used as a template for inventor Frank Haven Hall to create a derivative that would produce letter prints cheaper and faster.\n\nMalling-Hansen developed his typewriter further through the 1870s and 1880s and made many improvements, but the writing head remained the same. On the first model of the writing ball from 1870, the paper was attached to a cylinder inside a wooden box. In 1874, the cylinder was replaced by a carriage, moving beneath the writing head. Then, in 1875, the well-known \"tall model\" was patented, which was the first of the writing balls that worked without electricity. Malling-Hansen attended the world exhibitions in Vienna in 1873 and Paris in 1878 and he received the first-prize for his invention at both exhibitions.\n\nThe first typewriter to be commercially successful was invented in 1878 by Americans Christopher Latham Sholes, Frank Haven Hall, Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soule in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, although Sholes soon disowned the machine and refused to use, or even to recommend it. It looked \"like something like a cross between a piano and a kitchen table.\" The working prototype was made by the machinist Matthias Schwalbach. The patent (US 79,265) was sold for $12,000 to Densmore and Yost, who made an agreement with E. Remington and Sons (then famous as a manufacturer of sewing machines) to commercialize the machine as the \"Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer\".\n\nThis was the origin of the term \"typewriter\". Remington began production of its first typewriter on March 1, 1873, in Ilion, New York. It had a QWERTY keyboard layout, which because of the machine's success, was slowly adopted by other typewriter manufacturers. As with most other early typewriters, because the typebars strike upwards, the typist could not see the characters as they were typed.\n\nComing into the market in the early 1880s, the index typewriter uses a pointer or stylus to choose a letter from an index. The pointer is mechanically linked so that the letter chosen could then be printed, most often by the activation of a lever.\n\nThe index typewriter was briefly popular in niche markets. Although they were slower than keyboard type machines they were mechanically simpler and lighter, they were therefore marketed as being suitable for travellers, and because they could be produced more cheaply than keyboard machines, as budget machines for users who needed to produce small quantities of typed correspondence. The index typewriter's niche appeal however soon disappeared, as on the one hand new keyboard typewriters became lighter and more portable and on the other refurbished second hand machines began to become available. The last widely available western index machine was the Mignon typewriter produced by AEG which was produced until 1934. Considered one of the very best of the index typewriters, part of the Mignon's popularity was that it featured both interchangeable indexes and type, allowing the use of different fonts and character sets, something very few keyboard machines allowed and only at considerable added cost.\n\nAlthough pushed out of the market in most of the world by keyboard machines, successful Japanese and Chinese typewriters are of the index type albeit with a very much larger index and number of type elements.\n\nBy about 1910, the \"manual\" or \"mechanical\" typewriter had reached a somewhat standardized design. There were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a typebar that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head. When a key was struck briskly and firmly, the typebar hit a ribbon (usually made of inked fabric), making a printed mark on the paper wrapped around a cylindrical platen.\n\nThe platen was mounted on a carriage that moved left or right, automatically advancing the typing position horizontally after each character was typed. The paper, rolled around the typewriter's platen, was then advanced vertically by the carriage-return lever (at the far left, or on the far right for left handed typewriters) into position for each new line of text. A small bell was struck a few characters before the right hand margin was reached to warn the operator to complete the word and then use the carriage-return lever to shift the paper back to the beginning of the next line.\n\nIn most of the early typewriters, the typebars struck upward against the paper, pressed against the bottom of the platen, so the typist could not see the text as it was typed. What was typed was not visible until a carriage return caused it to scroll into view. The difficulty with any other arrangement was ensuring the typebars fell back into place reliably when the key was released. This was eventually achieved with various ingenious mechanical designs and so-called \"visible typewriters\" which used frontstriking, in which the typebars struck forward against the front side of the platen, became standard.\n\nOne of the first was the Daugherty Visible, introduced in 1893, which also introduced the four-bank keyboard that became standard, although the Underwood which came out two years later was the first major typewriter with these features. However, older \"nonvisible\" models continued in production to as late as 1915.\n\nA significant innovation was the shift key, introduced with the Remington No. 2 in 1878. This key physically \"shifted\" either the basket of typebars, in which case the typewriter is described as \"basket shift\", or the paper-holding carriage, in which case the typewriter is described as \"carriage shift\". Either mechanism caused a different portion of the typebar to come in contact with the ribbon/platen. The result is that each typebar could type two different characters, cutting the number of keys and typebars in half (and simplifying the internal mechanisms considerably). The obvious use for this was to allow letter keys to type both upper and lower case, but normally the number keys were also duplexed, allowing access to special symbols such as percent (%) and ampersand (&).\n\nBefore the shift key, typewriters had to have a separate key and typebar for upper-case letters; in essence, the typewriter had two keyboards, one above the other. With the shift key, manufacturing costs (and therefore purchase price) were greatly reduced, and typist operation was simplified; both factors contributed greatly to mass adoption of the technology. Certain models, such as the Barlet, had a double shift so that each key performed three functions. These little three-row machines were portable and could be used by journalists.\n\nHowever, because the shift key required more force to push (its mechanism was moving a much larger mass than other keys), and was operated by the little finger (normally the weakest finger on the hand), it was difficult to hold the shift down for more than two or three consecutive strokes. The \"shift lock\" key (the precursor to the modern caps lock) allowed the shift operation to be maintained indefinitely.\n\nTo facilitate typewriter use in business settings, a tab (tabulator) key was added in the late nineteenth century. Before using the key, the operator had to set mechanical \"tab stops\", pre-designated locations to which the carriage would advance when the tab key was pressed. This facilitated the typing of columns of numbers, freeing the operator from the need to manually position the carriage. The first models had one tab stop and one tab key; later ones allowed as many stops as desired, and sometimes had multiple tab keys, each of which moved the carriage a different number of spaces ahead of the decimal point (the tab stop), to facilitate the typing of columns with numbers of different length ($1.00, $10.00, $100.00, etc.)\n\nIn English-speaking countries, ordinary typewriters printing fixed-width characters were standardized to print six horizontal lines per vertical inch, and had either of two variants of character \"width\", called \"pica\" for ten characters per horizontal inch and \"elite\" for twelve. This differed from the use of these terms in printing, where \"pica\" is a linear unit (approximately 1⁄6 of an inch) used for any measurement, the most common one being the height of a type face.\n\nSome typewriters were designed to print extra-large type (commonly double height, double width) for labelling purposes. Classification numbers on books in libraries could be done this way.\n\nSome ribbons were inked in black and red stripes, each being half the width and running the entire length of the ribbon. A lever on most machines allowed switching between colors, which was useful for bookkeeping entries where negative amounts were highlighted in red. The red color was also used on some selected characters in running text, for emphasis. When a typewriter had this facility, it could still be fitted with a solid black ribbon; the lever was then used to switch to fresh ribbon when the first stripe ran out of ink. Some typewriters also had a third position which stopped the ribbon being struck at all. This enabled the keys to hit the paper unobstructed, and was used for cutting stencils for stencil duplicators (aka mimeograph machines).\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, a typewriter was marketed under the name \"Noiseless\" and advertised as \"silent.\" It was developed by Wellington Parker Kidder and the first model was marketed by the Noiseless Typewriter Company in 1917. An agreement with Remington in 1924 saw production transferred to Remington, and a further agreement in 1929 allowed Underwood to produce it as well. Noiseless portables sold well in the 1930s and 1940s, and noiseless standards continued to be manufactured until the 1960s.\n\nIn a conventional typewriter the typebar reaches the end of its travel simply by striking the ribbon and paper. A \"noiseless\" typewriter has a complex lever mechanism that decelerates the typebar mechanically before pressing it against the ribbon and paper in an attempt to dampen the noise. It certainly reduced the high-frequency content of the sound, rendering it more of a \"clunk\" than a \"clack\" and arguably less intrusive, but such advertising claims as \"A machine that can be operated a few feet away from your desk — And not be heard\" were not true.\n\nAlthough electric typewriters would not achieve widespread popularity until nearly a century later, the basic groundwork for the electric typewriter was laid by the Universal Stock Ticker, invented by Thomas Edison in 1870. This device remotely printed letters and numbers on a stream of paper tape from input generated by a specially designed typewriter at the other end of a telegraph line.\n\nSome electric typewriters were patented in the 19th century, but the first machine known to be produced in series is the Cahill of 1900.\n\nAnother electric typewriter was produced by the Blickensderfer Manufacturing Company, of Stamford, Connecticut, in 1902. Like the manual Blickensderfer typewriters, it used a cylindrical typewheel rather than individual typebars. The machine was produced in several variants but apparently it was not a commercial success, for reasons that are unclear.\n\nThe next step in the development of the electric typewriter came in 1910, when Charles and Howard Krum filed a patent for the first practical teletypewriter. The Krums' machine, named the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, used a typewheel rather than individual typebars. This machine was used for the first commercial teletypewriter system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City in 1910.\n\nJames Fields Smathers of Kansas City invented what is considered the first practical power-operated typewriter in 1914. In 1920, after returning from Army service, he produced a successful model and in 1923 turned it over to the Northeast Electric Company of Rochester for development. Northeast was interested in finding new markets for their electric motors and developed Smathers's design so that it could be marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 Remington Electric typewriters were produced powered by Northeast's motors.\n\nAfter some 2,500 electric typewriters had been produced, Northeast asked Remington for a firm contract for the next batch. However, Remington was engaged in merger talks which would eventually result in the creation of Remington Rand and no executives were willing to commit to a firm order. Northeast instead decided to enter the typewriter business for itself, and in 1929 produced the first Electromatic Typewriter.\n\nIn 1928, Delco, a division of General Motors, purchased Northeast Electric, and the typewriter business was spun off as Electromatic Typewriters, Inc. In 1933, Electromatic was acquired by IBM, which then spent on a redesign of the Electromatic Typewriter, launching the IBM Electric Typewriter Model 01 in 1935. By 1958 IBM was deriving 8% of its revenue from the sale of electric typewriters.\n\nIn 1931, an electric typewriter was introduced by Varityper Corporation. It was called the \"Varityper\", because a narrow cylinder-like wheel could be replaced to change the font.\n\nElectrical typewriter designs removed the \"direct\" mechanical connection between the keys and the element that struck the paper. Not to be confused with later \"electronic\" typewriters, electric typewriters contained only a single electrical component: the motor. Where the keystroke had previously moved a typebar directly, now it engaged mechanical linkages that directed mechanical power from the motor into the typebar.\n\nIn 1941, IBM announced the Electromatic Model 04 electric typewriter, featuring the revolutionary concept of proportional spacing. By assigning varied rather than uniform spacing to different sized characters, the Type 4 recreated the appearance of a printed page, an effect that was further enhanced by including the 1937 innovation of carbon-film ribbons that produced clearer, sharper words on the page. The proportional spacing feature became a staple of the IBM Executive series typewriters.\n\nIBM and Remington Rand electric typewriters were the leading models until IBM introduced the IBM Selectric typewriter in 1961, which replaced the typebars with a spherical element (or typeball) slightly smaller than a golf ball, with reverse-image letters molded into its surface. The Selectric used a system of latches, metal tapes, and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate the ball into the correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen. The typeball moved laterally in front of the paper, instead of the previous designs using a platen-carrying carriage moving the paper across a stationary print position.\n\nDue to the physical similarity, the typeball was sometimes referred to as a \"golfball\". The typeball design had many advantages, especially the elimination of \"jams\" (when more than one key was struck at once and the typebars became entangled) and in the ability to change the typeball, allowing multiple fonts to be used in a single document.\n\nThe IBM Selectric became a commercial success, dominating the office typewriter market for at least two decades. IBM also gained an advantage by marketing more heavily to schools than did Remington, with the idea that students who learned to type on a Selectric would later choose IBM typewriters over the competition in the workplace as businesses replaced their old manual models. By the 1970s, IBM had succeeded in establishing the Selectric as the de facto standard typewriter in mid- to high-end office environments, replacing the raucous \"clack\" of older typebar machines with the quieter sound of gyrating typeballs.\n\nLater models of IBM Executives and Selectrics replaced inked fabric ribbons with \"carbon film\" ribbons that had a dry black or colored powder on a clear plastic tape. These could be used only once, but later models used a cartridge that was simple to replace. A side effect of this technology was that the text typed on the machine could be easily read from the used ribbon, raising issues where the machines were used for preparing classified documents (ribbons had to be accounted for to ensure that typists did not carry them from the facility).\nA variation known as \"Correcting Selectrics\" introduced a correction feature, where a sticky tape in front of the carbon film ribbon could remove the black-powdered image of a typed character, eliminating the need for little bottles of white dab-on correction fluid and for hard erasers that could tear the paper. These machines also introduced selectable \"pitch\" so that the typewriter could be switched between pica type (10 characters per inch) and elite type (12 per inch), even within one document. Even so, all Selectrics were monospaced—each character and letterspace was allotted the same width on the page, from a capital \"W\" to a period. Although IBM had produced a successful typebar-based machine with five levels of proportional spacing, called the IBM Executive, proportional spacing was not provided with the Selectric typewriter or its successors the Selectric II and Selectric III.\n\nThe only fully electromechanical Selectric Typewriter with fully proportional spacing and which used a Selectric type element was the expensive Selectric Composer, which was capable of right-margin justification and was considered a typesetting machine rather than a typewriter.\n\nIn addition to its electronic successors, the Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer (MT/SC), the Mag Card Selectric Composer, and the Electronic Selectric Composer, IBM also made electronic typewriters with proportional spacing using the Selectric element that were considered typewriters or word processors instead of typesetting machines.\n\nThe first of these was the relatively obscure Mag Card Executive, which used 88-character elements. Later, some of the same typestyles used for it were used on the 96-character elements used on the IBM Electronic Typewriter 50 and the later models 65 and 85.\n\nBy 1970, as offset printing began to replace letterpress printing, the Composer would be adapted as the output unit for a typesetting system. The system included a computer-driven input station to capture the key strokes on magnetic tape and insert the operator's format commands, and a Composer unit to read the tape and produce the formatted text for photo reproduction.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nThe IBM 2741 terminal was a popular example of a Selectric-based computer terminal, and similar mechanisms were employed as the console devices for many IBM System/360 computers. These mechanisms used \"ruggedized\" designs compared to those in standard office typewriters.\n\nSome of IBM's advances were later adopted in less expensive machines from competitors. For example, Smith-Corona electric typewriters introduced in 1973 switched to interchangeable Coronamatic (SCM-patented) ribbon cartridges, including fabric, film, erasing, and two-color versions. At about the same time, the advent of photocopying meant that carbon copies and erasers were less and less necessary; only the original need be typed, and photocopies made from it.\n\nTowards the end of the commercial popularity of typewriters in the 1970s, a number of hybrid designs combining features of printers were introduced. These often incorporated keyboards from existing models of typewriters and printing mechanisms of dot-matrix printers. The generation of teleprinters with impact pin-based printing engines was not adequate for the demanding quality required for typed output, and alternative thermal transfer technologies used in thermal label printers had become technically feasible for typewriters.\n\nIBM produced a series of typewriters called Thermotronic with letter-quality output and correcting tape along with printers tagged Quietwriter. Brother extended the life of their typewriter product line with similar products. The development of these proprietary printing engines provided the vendors with exclusive markets in consumable ribbons and the ability to use standardized printing engines with varying degrees of electronic and software sophistication to develop product lines. Although these changes reduced prices—and greatly increased the convenience—of typewriters, the technological disruption posed by word processors left these improvements with only a short-term low-end market. To extend the life of these products, many examples were provided with communication ports to connect them to computers as printers.\n\nThe final major development of the typewriter was the electronic typewriter. Most of these replaced the typeball with a plastic or metal daisy wheel mechanism (a disk with the letters molded on the outside edge of the \"petals\"). The daisy wheel concept first emerged in printers developed by Diablo Systems in the 1970s. In 1981, Xerox Corporation, who by then had bought Diablo Systems, introduced a line of electronic typewriters incorporating this technology (the Memorywriter product line). For a time, these products were quite successful as their daisy-wheel mechanism was much simpler and cheaper than either typebar or Selectric mechanisms, and their electronic memory and display allowed the user to easily see errors and correct them before they were actually printed. One problem with the plastic daisy wheel was that they were not always durable. To solve this problem, more durable metal daisy wheels were made available (but at a slightly higher price).\n\nThese and similar electronic typewriters were in essence dedicated word processors with either single-line LCD displays or multi-line CRT displays, built-in line editors in ROM, a spelling and grammar checker, a few kilobytes of internal RAM and optional cartridge, magnetic card or diskette external memory-storage devices for storing text and even document formats. Text could be entered a line or paragraph at a time and edited using the display and built-in software tools before being committed to paper.\n\nUnlike the Selectrics and earlier models, these really were \"electronic\" and relied on integrated circuits and multiple electromechanical components. These typewriters were sometimes called \"display typewriters\", \"dedicated word processors\" or \"word-processing typewriters\", though the latter term was also frequently applied to less sophisticated machines that featured only a tiny, sometimes just single-row display. Sophisticated models were also called \"word processors\", though today that term almost always denotes a type of software program. Manufacturers of such machines included Brother (Brother WP1 and WP500 etc., where WP stood for word processor), Canon (Canon Cat), Smith-Corona (PWP, i.e. Personal Word Processor line) and Philips/Magnavox (VideoWriter).\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were a time of transition for typewriters and word processors. At one point in time, most small-business offices would be completely \"old-style\", while large corporations and government departments would already be \"new-style\"; other offices would have a mixture. The pace of change was so rapid that it was common for clerical staff to have to learn several new systems, one after the other, in just a few years. While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.\n\nDue to falling sales, IBM sold its typewriter division in 1991 to Lexmark, completely exiting from a market it once dominated.\n\nThe increasing dominance of personal computers, desktop publishing, the introduction of low-cost, truly high-quality laser and inkjet printer technologies, and the pervasive use of web publishing, e-mail and other electronic communication techniques have largely replaced typewriters in the United States. Still, , typewriters continued to be used by a number of government agencies and other institutions in the US, where they are primarily used to fill preprinted forms. According to a Boston typewriter repairman quoted by \"The Boston Globe\", \"Every maternity ward has a typewriter, as well as funeral homes\".\nA fairly major typewriter user is the City of New York, which in 2008 purchased several thousand typewriters, mostly for use by the New York Police Department, at the total cost of $982,269. Another $99,570 was spent in 2009 for the maintenance of the existing typewriters. New York police officers would use the machines to type property and evidence vouchers on carbon paper forms.\n\nA rather specialized market for typewriters exists due to the regulations of many correctional systems in the US, where prisoners are prohibited from having computers or telecommunication equipment, but are allowed to own typewriters. The Swintec corporation (headquartered in Moonachie, New Jersey), which, as of 2011, still produced typewriters at its overseas factories (in Japan, Indonesia, and/or Malaysia), manufactures a variety of typewriters for use in prisons, made of clear plastic (to make it harder for prisoners to hide prohibited items inside it). As of 2011, the company had contracts with prisons in 43 US states.\n\nIn April 2011, Godrej and Boyce, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of mechanical typewriters, closed its doors, leading to a flurry of erroneous news reports that the \"world's last typewriter factory\" had shut down. The reports were quickly debunked.\n\nIn November 2012, Brother's UK factory manufactured what it claimed to be the last typewriter ever made in the UK; the typewriter was donated to the London Science Museum.\n\nRussian typewriters use Cyrillic, which has made the ongoing Azerbaijani reconversion from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet more difficult. In 1997, the government of Turkey offered to donate western typewriters to the Republic of Azerbaijan in exchange for more zealous and exclusive promotion of the Latin alphabet for the Azerbaijani language; this offer, however, was declined.\n\nIn Latin America and Africa, mechanical typewriters are still common because they can be used without electrical power. In Latin America, the typewriters used are most often Brazilian models – Brazil continues to produce mechanical (Facit) and electronic (Olivetti) typewriters to the present day.\n\nThe 21st century has seen a revival of interest in typewriters among certain subcultures, including makers, steampunks, hipsters, and street poets.\n\nAccording to the standards taught in secretarial schools in the mid-20th century, a business letter was supposed to have no mistakes and no visible corrections. Accuracy was prized as much as speed. Indeed, typing speeds, as scored in proficiency tests and typewriting speed competitions, included a deduction of ten words for every mistake. Corrections were, of course, necessary, and many methods were developed.\n\nIn practice, several methods would often be combined. For example, if six extra copies of a letter were needed, the fluid-corrected original would be photocopied, but only for the two recipients getting \"c.c.\"s; the other four copies, the less-important file copies that stayed in various departments at the office, would be cheaper, hand-erased, less-distinct bond paper copies or even \"flimsies\" of different colors (tissue papers interleaved with black carbon paper) that were all typed as a \"carbon pack\" at the same time as the original.\n\nIn informal applications such as personal letters where low priority was placed on the appearance of the document, or conversely in highly formal applications in which it was important that any corrections be obvious, the backspace key could be used to back up over the error and then overstrike it with hyphens, slashes, Xs, or the like.\n\nThe traditional erasing method involved the use of a special \"typewriter eraser\" made of hard rubber that contained an abrasive material. Some were thin, flat disks, pink or gray, approximately in diameter by ⅛ inch (3.2 mm) thick, with a brush attached from the center, while others looked like pink pencils, with a sharpenable eraser at the \"lead\" end and a stiff nylon brush at the other end. Either way, these tools made possible erasure of individual typed letters. Business letters were typed on heavyweight, high-rag-content bond paper, not merely to provide a luxurious appearance, but also to stand up to erasure.\n\nTypewriter eraser brushes were necessary for clearing eraser crumbs and paper dust, and using the brush properly was an important element of typewriting skill; if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a small buildup could cause the typebars to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.\n\nErasing a set of carbon copies was particularly difficult, and called for the use of a device called an \"eraser shield\" (a thin stainless-steel rectangle about with several tiny holes in it) to prevent the pressure of erasing on the upper copies from producing carbon smudges on the lower copies. To correct copies, typists had to go from carbon copy to carbon copy, trying not to get their fingers dirty as they leafed through the carbon papers, and moving and repositioning the eraser shield and eraser for each copy.\n\nPaper companies produced a special form of typewriter paper called \"erasable bond\" (for example, Eaton's Corrasable Bond). This incorporated a thin layer of material that prevented ink from penetrating and was relatively soft and easy to remove from the page. An ordinary soft pencil eraser could quickly produce perfect erasures on this kind of paper. However, the same characteristics that made the paper erasable made the characters subject to smudging due to ordinary friction and deliberate alteration after the fact, making it unacceptable for business correspondence, contracts, or any archival use.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, correction fluid made its appearance, under brand names such as Liquid Paper, Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex; it was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham. Correction fluid was a kind of opaque, white, fast-drying paint that produced a fresh white surface onto which, when dry, a correction could be retyped. However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was the patch of dry correction fluid (which was never perfectly flat, and frequently not a perfect match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard trick for solving this problem was photocopying the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers.\n\nA different fluid was available for correcting stencils. It sealed up the stencil ready for retyping but did not attempt to color match.\n\nDry correction products (such as correction paper) under brand names such as \"Ko-Rec-Type\" were introduced in the 1970s and functioned like white carbon paper. A strip of the product was placed over the letters needing correction, and the incorrect letters were retyped, causing the black character to be overstruck with a white overcoat. Similar material was soon incorporated in carbon-film electric typewriter ribbons; like the traditional two-color black-and-red inked ribbon common on manual typewriters, a black and white correcting ribbon became commonplace on electric typewriters. But the black or white coating could be partly rubbed off with handling, so such corrections were generally not acceptable in legal documents.\n\nThe pinnacle of this kind of technology was the IBM Electronic Typewriter series. These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory. With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically backspacing and then overstriking the previous characters with minimal marring of the paper. White cover-up ribbons were used with fabric ink ribbons, or an alternate premium design featured plastic lift-off correction ribbons which were used with carbon film typing ribbons. This latter technology actually lifted the carbon film forming a typed letter, leaving nothing more than a flattened depression in the surface of the paper, with the advantage that no color matching of the paper was needed.\n\nThe 1874 Sholes & Glidden typewriters established the \"QWERTY\" layout for the letter keys. During the period in which Sholes and his colleagues were experimenting with this invention, other keyboard arrangements were apparently tried, but these are poorly documented. The QWERTY layout of keys has become the de facto standard for English-language typewriter and computer keyboards. Other languages written in the Latin alphabet sometimes use variants of the QWERTY layouts, such as the French AZERTY, the Italian QZERTY and the German QWERTZ layouts.\n\nThe QWERTY layout is not the most efficient layout possible for the English language, since it requires a touch-typist to move his or her fingers between rows to type the most common letters. Although the QWERTY keyboard was the most commonly used layout in typewriters, a better, less strenuous keyboard was being searched for throughout the late 1900s.\n\nOne popular but unverified explanation for the QWERTY arrangement is that it was designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of typebars by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.\n\nAnother story is that the QWERTY layout allowed early typewriter salesmen to impress their customers by being able to easily type out the example word \"typewriter\" without having learned the full keyboard layout , because \"typewriter\" can be spelled purely on the top row of the keyboard. However, there is no evidence to support these claims.\n\nA number of radically different layouts such as Dvorak have been proposed to reduce the perceived inefficiencies of QWERTY, but none have been able to displace the QWERTY layout; their proponents claim considerable advantages, but so far none has been widely used. The Blickensderfer typewriter with its DHIATENSOR layout may have possibly been the first attempt at optimizing the keyboard layout for efficiency advantages.\n\nMany non-Latin alphabets have keyboard layouts that have nothing to do with QWERTY. The Russian layout, for instance, puts the common trigrams ыва, про, and ить on adjacent keys so that they can be typed by rolling the fingers. The Greek layout, on the other hand, is a variant of QWERTY.\n\nTypewriters were also made for East Asian languages with thousands of characters, such as Chinese or Japanese. They were not easy to operate, but professional typists used them for a long time until the development of electronic word processors and laser printers in the 1980s.\n\nOn modern keyboards, the exclamation point is the shifted character on the 1 key, a direct result of the historical fact that these were the last characters to become \"standard\" on keyboards. Holding the spacebar pressed down usually suspended the carriage advance mechanism (a so-called \"dead key\" feature), allowing one to superimpose multiple keystrikes on a single location. The ¢ symbol (meaning cents) was located above the number 6 on electric typewriters, while ASCII computer keyboards have ^ instead.\n\nA number of typographical conventions originate from the widespread use of the typewriter, based on the characteristics and limitations of the typewriter itself. For example, the QWERTY keyboard typewriter did not include keys for the en dash and the em dash. To overcome this limitation, users typically typed more than one adjacent hyphen to approximate these symbols. This typewriter convention is still sometimes used today, even though modern computer word processing applications can input the correct en and em dashes for each font type.\n\nOther examples of typewriter practices that are sometimes still used in desktop publishing systems include inserting a double space at the end of a sentence, and the use of straight quotes (or \"dumb quotes\") as quotation marks and prime marks. The practice of underlining text in place of italics and the use of all capitals to provide emphasis are additional examples of typographical conventions that derived from the limitations of the typewriter keyboard that still carry on today.\n\nMany older typewriters did not include a separate key for the numeral 1 or the exclamation point, and some even older ones also lacked the numeral zero. Typists who trained on these machines learned the habit of using the lowercase letter l (\"ell\") for the digit 1, and the uppercase O for the zero. A cents symbol (¢) was created by combining (over-striking) a lower case 'c' with a slash character (typing 'c', then backspace, then '/').\n\nSimilarly, the exclamation point was created by combining an apostrophe and a period. These characters were omitted to simplify design and reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs; they were chosen specifically because they were \"redundant\" and could be recreated using other keys.\n\nSome terminology from the typewriter age has survived into the personal computer era. Examples include:\n\nIn the above listing, the two-letter codes in parentheses are abbreviations for the ASCII characters derived from typewriter usage.\n\nWhen Remington started marketing typewriters, the company assumed the machine would not be used for composing but for transcribing dictation, and that the person typing would be a woman. The 1800s Sholes and Glidden typewriter had floral ornamentation on the case.\n\nDuring World War I and II, increasing numbers of women were entering the workforce. In the United States, women often started in the professional workplace as typists. Questions about morals made a salacious businessman making sexual advances to a female typist into a cliché of office life, appearing in vaudeville and movies. Being a typist was considered the right choice for a \"good girl\" meaning women who present themselves as being chaste and having good conduct. According to the 1900 census, 94.9 percent of stenographers and typists were unmarried women.\n\nThe \"Tijuana bibles\" — adult comic books produced in Mexico for the American market, starting in the 1930s — often featured women typists. In one panel, a businessman in a three-piece suit, ogling his secretary’s thigh, says, \"Miss Higby, are you ready for—ahem!—er—dictation?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTypewritten documents may be examined by forensic document examiners. This is done primarily to determine 1) the make and/or model of the typewriter used to produce a document, or 2) whether or not a particular suspect typewriter might have been used to produce a document. In some situations, an ink or correction ribbon may also be examined.\n\nThe determination of a make and/or model of typewriter is a 'classification' problem and several systems have been developed for this purpose. These include the original Haas Typewriter Atlases (Pica version) and (Non-Pica version) and the TYPE system developed by Dr. Philip Bouffard, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Termatrex Typewriter classification system, and the Interpol's Typewriter classification system, among others.\n\nBecause of the tolerances of the mechanical parts, slight variation in the alignment of the letters and their uneven wear, each typewriter has an individual \"signature\" or \"fingerprint\", which may permit a typewritten document to be traced back to the typewriter on which it was produced. For devices utilizing replaceable components, such as a typeball element, any association may be restricted to a specific element, rather than to the typewriter as a whole.\n\nThe earliest reference in fictional literature to the potential identification of a typewriter as having produced a document was by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who wrote \"A Case of Identity\" in 1891. In non-fiction, the first document examiner to describe how a typewriter might be identified was William E. Hagan who wrote, in 1894, \"All typewriter machines, even when using the same kind of type, become more or less peculiar by use as to the work done by them\". Other early discussions of the topic were provided by A. S. Osborn in his 1908 treatise, \"Typewriting as Evidence\", and again in his 1929 textbook, \"Questioned Documents\". A modern description of the examination procedure is laid out in ASTM Standard E2494-08 (Standard Guide for Examination of Typewritten Items).\n\nTypewriter examination was used in the Leopold and Loeb and Alger Hiss cases. In the Eastern Bloc, typewriters (together with printing presses, copy machines, and later computer printers) were a controlled technology, with secret police in charge of maintaining files of the typewriters and their owners. In the Soviet Union, the First Department of each organization sent data on organization's typewriters to the KGB. This posed a significant risk for dissidents and samizdat authors. In Romania, according to State Council Decree No. 98 of March 28, 1983, owning a typewriter, both by businesses or by private persons, was subject to an approval given by the local police authorities. People previously convicted of any crime or those who because of their behaviour were considered to be \"a danger to public order or to the security of the state\" were refused approval. In addition, once a year, typewriter owners had to take the typewriter to the local police station, where they would be asked to type down a sample of all the typewriter's characters. It was also forbidden to borrow, lend, or repair typewriters other than at the places that had been authorized by the police.\n\nThe ribbon can be read, although only if it has not been typed over more than once. This is not as easy as reading text from a page as the ribbon does not include spaces, but can be done, giving every typewriter a \"memory\".\n\n|valign=\"top\"|\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "321787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321787", "title": "UTF-7", "text": "UTF-7\n\nUTF-7 (7-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-length character encoding that was proposed for representing Unicode text using a stream of ASCII characters. It was originally intended to provide a means of encoding Unicode text for use in Internet E-mail messages that was more efficient than the combination of UTF-8 with quoted-printable.\n\nUTF-7 is used by less than 0.003% of websites. UTF-8 has since 2009 been the dominant encoding (of any kind, not just of Unicode encodings) for the World Wide Web (and declared mandatory \"for all things\" by WHATWG).\n\nMIME, the modern standard of E-mail format, forbids encoding of headers using byte values above the ASCII range. Although MIME allows encoding the message body in various character sets (broader than ASCII), the underlying transmission infrastructure (SMTP, the main E-mail transfer standard) is still not guaranteed to be 8-bit clean. Therefore, a non-trivial content transfer encoding has to be applied in case of doubt. Unfortunately base64 has a disadvantage of making even US-ASCII characters unreadable in non-MIME clients. On the other hand, UTF-8 combined with quoted-printable produces a very size-inefficient format requiring 6–9 bytes for non-ASCII characters from the BMP and 12 bytes for characters outside the BMP.\n\nProvided certain rules are followed during encoding, UTF-7 can be sent in e-mail without using an underlying MIME transfer encoding, but still must be explicitly identified as the text character set. In addition, if used within e-mail headers such as \"Subject:\", UTF-7 must be contained in MIME encoded words identifying the character set. Since encoded words force use of either quoted-printable or base64, UTF-7 was designed to avoid using the = sign as an escape character to avoid double escaping when it is combined with quoted-printable (or its variant, the RFC 2047/1522 ?Q?-encoding of headers).\n\nUTF-7 is generally not used as a native representation within applications as it is very awkward to process. Despite its size advantage over the combination of UTF-8 with either quoted-printable or base64, the now defunct Internet Mail Consortium recommended against its use.\n\n8BITMIME has also been introduced, which reduces the need to encode message bodies in a 7-bit format.\n\nA modified form of UTF-7 (sometimes dubbed 'mUTF-7') is currently used in the IMAP e-mail retrieval protocol for mailbox names.\n\nUTF-7 was first proposed as an experimental protocol in RFC 1642, \"A Mail-Safe Transformation Format of Unicode\". This RFC has been made obsolete by RFC 2152, an informational RFC which never became a standard. As RFC 2152 clearly states, the RFC \"does not specify an Internet standard of any kind\". Despite this, RFC 2152 is quoted as the definition of UTF-7 in the IANA's list of charsets. Neither is UTF-7 a Unicode Standard. \"The Unicode Standard 5.0\" only lists UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.\nThere is also a modified version, specified in RFC 2060, which is sometimes identified as UTF-7.\n\nSome characters can be represented directly as single ASCII bytes. The first group is known as \"direct characters\" and contains 62 alphanumeric characters and 9 symbols: codice_1. The direct characters are safe to include literally. The other main group, known as \"optional direct characters\", contains all other printable characters in the range –U+007E except codice_2 and space. Using the optional direct characters reduces size and enhances human readability but also increases the chance of breakage by things like badly designed mail gateways and may require extra escaping when used in encoded words for header fields.\n\nSpace, tab, carriage return and line feed may also be represented directly as single ASCII bytes. However, if the encoded text is to be used in e-mail, care is needed to ensure that these characters are used in ways that do not require further content transfer encoding to be suitable for e-mail. The plus sign (codice_3) \"may\" be encoded as codice_4.\n\nOther characters must be encoded in UTF-16 (hence U+10000 and higher would be encoded into surrogates), big-endian (hence higher-order bits appear first), and then in modified Base64. The start of these blocks of modified Base64 encoded UTF-16 is indicated by a codice_3 sign. The end is indicated by any character not in the modified Base64 set. If the character after the modified Base64 is a codice_6 (ASCII hyphen-minus) then it is consumed by the decoder and decoding resumes with the next character. Otherwise decoding resumes with the character after the base64.\n\nFirst, an encoder must decide which characters to represent directly in ASCII form, which codice_3 has to be escaped as codice_4, and which to place in blocks of Unicode characters. A simple encoder may encode all characters it considers safe for direct encoding directly. However the cost of ending a Unicode sequence, outputing a single character directly in ASCII and then starting another Unicode sequence is 3 to 3⅔ bytes. This is more than the 2⅔ bytes needed to represent the character as a part of a Unicode sequence. Each Unicode sequence must be encoded using the following procedure, then surrounded by the appropriate delimiters.\n\nUsing the £† (U+00A3 U+2020) character sequence as an example:\n\nFirst an encoded data must be separated into plain ASCII text chunks (including +es followed by a dash) and nonempty Unicode blocks as mentioned in the description section. Once this is done, each Unicode block must be decoded with the following procedure (using the result of the encoding example above as our example)\n\n\nA Unicode signature (often loosely called a \"BOM\") is an optional special byte sequence at the very start of a stream or file that, without being data itself, indicates the encoding used for the data that follows; a signature is used in the absence of metadata that denotes the encoding. For a given encoding scheme, the signature is that scheme's representation of Unicode code point codice_9, the so-called \"BOM\" (byte-order mark) [character].\n\nWhile a Unicode signature is typically a single, fixed byte sequence, the nature of UTF-7 necessitates 5 variations: The last 2 bits of the 4th byte of the UTF-7 encoding of codice_9 belong to the \"following\" character, resulting in 4 possible bit patterns and therefore 4 different possible bytes in the 4th position. The 5th variation is needed to disambiguate the case where no characters at all follow the signature. See the UTF-7 entry in the table of Unicode signatures.\n\nUTF-7 allows multiple representations of the same source string. In particular, ASCII characters can be represented as part of Unicode blocks. As such, if standard ASCII-based escaping or validation processes are used on strings that may be later interpreted as UTF-7, then Unicode blocks may be used to slip malicious strings past them. To mitigate this problem, systems should perform decoding before validation and should avoid attempting to autodetect UTF-7.\n\nOlder versions of Internet Explorer can be tricked into interpreting the page as UTF-7. This can be used for a cross-site scripting attack as the codice_11 and codice_12 marks can be encoded as codice_13 and codice_14 in UTF-7, which most validators let through as simple text.\n\n"}

The word comes from the Arabic \"w-l-y\", \"to govern\": a \"wāli\"—\"governor\"—governs a \"wilayah\", \"that which is governed\". Under the Caliphate, the term referred to any constituent near-sovereign state.\n\nIn Arabic, \"wilayah\" is used to refer to the states of the United States, and the United States of America as a whole is called \"al-Wilāyāt al-Muttaḥidah al-Amrīkīyah\", literally meaning \"the American United States\".\n\nFor Morocco, which is divided into provinces \"and\" wilāyas, the translation \"province\" would cause the distinction to cease. For Sudan, the term \"state\", and for Mauritania, the term \"region\" is used.\n\nThe governorates of Iraq (muhafazah) are sometimes translated as provinces, in contrast to official Iraqi documents and the general use for other Arab countries. This conflicts somehow with the general translation for \"muhafazah\" (governorate) and \"wilāyah\" (province).\n\nIn the ethnically-diverse Xinjiang region of northwest China, the seven undifferentiated prefectures proper (; that is, not prefecture-level cities, autonomous prefectures, etc.) are translated into the minority Uygur language as \"Vilayiti\" ().

As of March 2015, it governs 20 vilayat: 10 in Iraq, 9 in Syria, and one, \"Al-Furat Wilayat\" (\"Euphrates Province\") that straddles both sides of the former border. Other than for internal governance, the Islamic State claims territory all over the world and cooperates with Islamic terror organizations while fashioning them wilayat of the ISIS center. For example, Boko Haram calls itself \"Wilāyat Gharb Ifrīqīyyah\", meaning \"The Islamic State's West Africa Province\".\n\nIn Kenya, the term \"wilaya\" is a Swahili term which refers to the administrative districts into which provinces are divided.\n\nIn Malay, Indonesian, and Tausug, \"wilayah\" or \"wilāya\" is a general word meaning \"territory\", \"area\" or \"region\".\n\nIn Malaysia, the term\n\nIn Philippines, the term\n\nTraditionally the provinces of the Ottoman Empire were known as \"eyâlet\"s, but beginning in 1864, they were gradually restructured as smaller \"vilâyet\"s—the Turkish pronunciation of the Arabic word \"wilāyah\". Most were subdivided into sanjaks.\n\nThe current provinces of Turkey are called \"il\" in Turkish.\n\nThe Persian word for \"province\" (\"velâyat\") is still used in several similar forms in Central Asian countries:\n\nDuring the Soviet period the divisions of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were called \"oblasts\" and \"raions\", using Russian terminology.\n\nIn the Tsez language, the districts of Dagestan are also referred to as \"вилайат\" (\"wilayat\"), plural \"вилайатйоби\" (\"wilayatyobi\"). But the term \"район\" (\"rayon\"), plural \"районйаби\" (\"rayonyabi\") is also used.\n\nCaucasus Emirate, a self-proclaimed successor state to the unrecognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, is divided into vilayats.\n\nIn Iran, the word is also used unofficially.\n\nIn Urdu, the term \"Vilayat\" is used to refer to any foreign country. As an adjective \"Vilayati\" is used to indicate an imported article or good. In Bengali, the term \"Vilayat\" and \"Vilayati\" further change to \"bilet\" and \"bileti\" (archaic \"bilaiti\"), referring exclusively to Britain and British-made. The British slang term blighty derives from this word, via the fact that the foreign British were referred to using this word during the time of the British Raj.\n"}

It is spoken by the Onge people in Little Andaman Island in India.\n\nIn the 18th century the Onge were distributed across Little Andaman Island and the nearby islands, with some territory and camps established on Rutland Island and the southern tip of South Andaman Island. Originally restive, they were pacified by M. V. Portman in the 1890s. By the end of the 19th century they sometimes visited the South and North Brother Islands to catch sea turtles; at the time, those islands seemed to be the boundary between their territory and the range of the Great Andamanese people further north. Today, the surviving members (less than 100) are confined to two reserve camps on Little Andaman, Dugong Creek in the northeast and South Bay.\n\nThe Onge were semi-nomadic and fully dependent on hunting and gathering for food.\n\nThe Onge are one of the aboriginal peoples (adivasi) of India. Together with the other Andamanese tribes and a few other isolated groups elsewhere in East Asia, they comprise the Negrito peoples, believed to be remnants of a very early migration out of Africa.\n\nÖnge used to be spoken throughout Little Andaman as well as in smaller islands to the north - and possibly in the southern tip of South Andaman island. Since the middle of the 19th century, with the arrival of the British in the Andamans, and, after Indian independence, the massive inflow of Indian settlers from the mainland, the number of Onge speakers has steadily declined, although a moderate increase has been observed in recent years. Currently, there are only 94 native speakers of Onge, confined to a single settlement in the northeast of Little Andaman island (see map below), making it an endangered language.\n\nThe Onge are one of the least fertile people in the world. About 40% of the married couples are sterile. Onge women rarely become pregnant before the age of 28. Infant and child mortality is in the range of 40%. The Onge's net reproductive index is 0.91. The net reproductive index among the Great Andamanese is 1.40.\n\nThere is some vowel harmony: 1p pl. prefix et- becomes [ot-] when the vowel in the next syllable is /u/, e.g. \"et-eɟale\" 'our faces' but \"ot-oticule\" 'our heads'.\n\n/ʔ/? (c.f. Blevins (2007:161))\n\nBlevins (2007:160-161) states that /c, ɟ/ are actually affricates, and that retroflexes may or may not be phonemic.\n\n/kʷ/ delabializes to /k/ before /u, o/.\n\nPhonemic /d/ surfaces as [r] intervocalically, while arguably some words have phonemic /r/ which alternates with surface [r, l, j].\n\nWords may be monosyllabic or longer, even in content words (unlike in the closely related Jarawa). Words may begin with consonants or vowels, and maximal syllables are of the form CVC. All Onge words end in vowels, except for imperatives, e.g. \"kaʔ\" 'give'.\n\nConsonant-final stems in Jarawa often have cognates with final \"e\" in Onge, e.g. Jarawa \"iŋ\", Onge \"iŋe\" 'water'; Jarawa \"inen\", Onge \"inene\" 'foreigner'; Jarawa \"dag\", Onge \"dage\" 'coconut'. Historically these vowels must have been excrescent, as nonetymological word-final e doesn't surface when number markers are suffixed, and the definite article (-\"gi\" after etymological consonants, -\"i\" after etymological vowels, due to lenition) appears as -\"i\" after etymological \"e\" but as -\"gi\" after excrescent \"e\", e.g. \"daŋe\" → \"daŋe-gi\" 'tree; dugout'; \"kue\" → \"kue-i\" 'pig'.\n\nNC clusters sometimes optionally reduce to single C, e.g. ~ 'to drink' (c.f. Jarawa ).\n\nVoiced obstruents may optionally nasalize in syllable onset when the coda is nasal, e.g. \"bone\"/\"mone\" 'resin, resin torch' (c.f. Jarawa \"pone\" 'resin, resin torch').\n\nClusters across morpheme boundaries simplify to homorganic sequences, including geminates, which may occur after word final -e drops, e.g. \"daŋe\" 'tree, dugout canoe' → \"dandena\" 'two canoes'; \"umuge\" 'pigeon' → \"umulle\" 'pigeons'.\n"}
